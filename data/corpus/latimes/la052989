A far-right West German party said it plans to expel one of its members for 
allegedly making anti-Semitic remarks, and it called for the man's resignation 
from the Frankfurt city council. Legislator Erich Gutjahr was quoted by the 
Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper Friday as saying "Jews are plundering us again" 
and that something must be done about it. Winfried Krauss, spokesman for the 
National Party of Germany, said the party "distances itself" from Gutjahr's 
reported statements.

A 42-year-old Swede with a history of drug abuse and violence will be charged 
today with the 1986 murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, Chief 
Prosecutor Anders Helin said in Stockholm. He said the case against Christer 
Pettersson was base on identification by several witnesses who were on the 
Stockholm street where Palme was fatally shot as he walked home from a movie 
with his wife. Pettersson, whose past crimes include the bayonet murder of a 
youth, has been in custody since last December while the prosecution has been 
preparing its case.

Thousands of Muscovites, some urging the removal of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, protested in the Soviet capital over the exclusion of 
anti-Establishment hero Boris N. Yeltsin and other reformers from the new 
standing Parliament, the Supreme Soviet. About 8,000 people at a rally shouted 
and cheered as human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov condemned what he 
called the authorities' manipulation of the new Congress of People's Deputies. 
The congress elected a predominantly conservative 542-member Supreme Soviet, 
which will meet for eight months a year to ratify or reject all acts of the 
government.

France confirmed that it has received technical help from the United States in 
its nuclear weapons program but stressed that its nuclear deterrent remains 
totally independent. The Defense Ministry was reacting to an article in the 
U.S. magazine Foreign Policy claiming that Washington has secretly helped the 
French nuclear weapons program for the last 15 years in violation of U.S. law. 
U.S. officials, in an earlier statement confirming the exchange, said it did 
not violate any U.S. laws. French officials said there was no dependence of 
French nuclear forces on "foreign technologies" and no effect on "the 
independence of French decision-making."

The Bush Administration is planning to change the mix of airplanes and 
helicopters assigned to aircraft carriers, resulting in a Navy-wide loss of one 
full carrier's worth of aircraft, according to a study by the Congressional 
Research Service of the Library of Congress. Rep. George J. Hochbrueckner 
(D-N.Y.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, requested the study 
as part of efforts by him and Long Island's four other congressmen to save the 
F-14D jet fighter, which was cut from the 1990 budget by Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney. The F-14D Tomcat is manufactured by Grumman Corp. in Bethpage, N.Y. 
Ronald O'Rourke, the naval analyst who prepared the study, said he learned that 
the Navy is planning to switch in the 1990s from a combination of aircraft 
carrier configurations to a standardized "transitional" air wing, for a 
reduction of 126 to 128 aircraft.

Mostly mild Memorial Day weekend weather across the nation was punctuated by 
storms in the Midwest, squalls in the East and a brief return to winter in 
parts of the Rockies. In Montana and Idaho, snow was expected in the mountains 
and eastern slopes above 5,000 feet and two to three inches of slush was 
reported on roads in the Cutbank, Mont., area. Thunderstorms extended across 
much of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Minnesota and South Dakota, where high winds 
downed trees and blew a semi-truck off the road. Boaters returned under clear 
skies to Boston Harbor for the John F. Kennedy Regatta competition, where a day 
earlier 20 young sailors were tossed from their small sailboats and into the 
40-degree waters when a squall suddenly hit the area. All were rescued. 
Michigan residents awoke to clear skies but unseasonably cold temperatures as 
Alpena hit a record low of 31 degrees.

Funding for some non-classroom operations may have to be cut this summer at Cal 
State Fresno in order to repay the state $2.9 million mistakenly allocated to 
the school, officials said. An audit found the error in budget calculations, 
and the school has agreed to repay the money by June 30. Examiners from the 
state chancellor's office found that school budget officials had miscalculated 
several key projections used by the state to determine fiscal year funding. The 
shortfall represents 3% of the school's $100-million annual budget.

The Berkeley Chamber of Commerce said that the City Council should be held 
responsible for this month's riot on Telegraph Avenue. In a blunt statement, 
the chamber blamed the council's "confrontational" attitude toward UC 
Berkeley's growth plans, which include construction of a dormitory in People's 
Park, for precipitating the violence. The outbreak, in which 28 stores were 
looted or damaged and 20 people were hurt, followed a demonstration to 
commemorate the 20-year-old struggle over People's Park, a piece of 
university-owned land near Telegraph Avenue.

Soviet soldiers planned to massacre people during a pro-independence rally 
April 9 in the Georgian republic and used clubs to beat the injured and the 
elderly, an official report said. The report, issued by a Georgian commission 
that looked into the clash that left at least 20 dead, was circulated among 
deputies to the new Congress of People's Deputies, which met in Moscow over the 
weekend. The report said soldiers "blocked crossings, surrounded citizens and 
beat them with clubs and shovels. They did not spare hunger strikers, girls, 
old women, doctors and Red Cross workers."

A LOT'S AT STAKE ALONG THE MILE IN NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, dozens of businessmen have had their eye on Allan Olson's 4.7 
acres situated at the south end of National City Boulevard. Everyone from fast 
food restaurateurs to car dealers have inquired about the property, but the 
retired aircraft engineer has gamely hung on to the land for 44 years, thinking 
that one day it would be worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought that this property was going to be my security in my old age, 
especially as I watched the Mile of Cars grow on the boulevard," Olson said. 
"If not security for my wife and me, then it was something that I could leave 
to my kids and grandkids." 
</P>
<P>
Olson, who has been a cautious and conservative man all of his 75 years, 
estimated his property's value at $2 million, but certain to increase when 
adjacent California 54, which separates National City and Chula Vista, is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sights on Property 
</P>
<P>
Unknown to Olson, though, the city of National City also had it sights on his 
property. Since the city's redevelopment agency told him that the City Council 
would acquire the land through a purchase agreement or condemnation, if 
necessary, suitors have stopped calling, Olson said. He charged that city 
officials put out the word last year to prospective car dealers that if they 
wait until National City acquires the property, they will get a much sweeter 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Peterson, executive director of the Community Development Commission, 
the agency in charge of redevelopment, does not deny that city officials want 
to see two car dealers on Olson's property, but he scoffed at charges of 
preferential treatment for auto dealers, who have become National City's 
economic salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is a zoning problem to be worked out. Olson's land is zoned 
for light manufacturing. If the city wants car dealers on the property, it will 
have to be re-zoned to allow for a car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, said Peterson, explaining that the City Council is more than 
willing to change the zoning so that the property will fit nicely inside 
National City's redevelopment plan, which was approved in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly and without much warning, Olson's retirement nest egg has cracked and 
exposed an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a bunch of slickers. They think that if I get one-fourth of what the 
property is worth that's all an old guy like me needs . . . They say that the 
person who leases most of my property has more to lose than me," said Olson, 
who was interviewed in his comfortable Chula Vista home. 
</P>
<P>
Although the property has been inside the city's redevelopment boundary since 
1981, Olson said that he did not realize this until last month. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a 93-space trailer park, which has been there since 1950, sits on 
the property. The owner of the park has almost 19 years left on a lease that he 
signed with Olson. Peterson, a no-nonsense bureaucrat who is blunt if not 
candid, said that the trailer park does not conform with the property's present 
zoning designation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Olson, Peterson approached him last year and offered to lease a 
narrow unused portion of the property, which is actually a hole in the ground, 
for $1,000 per month. In addition, Peterson offered to help him find a car 
dealer who would be willing to lease part of the land if Olson succeeded in 
evicting the trailer park tenants, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to make a study and help me get a car dealer on there," 
said Olson. "I didn't know they wanted to condemn my property instead. I 
thought he was working with me. I thought he was going to help me." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson denied making any promises to Olson. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, my intention is to acquire, by condemnation if necessary, the 
trailer park and the parcel that we are currently renting from Mr. Olson," said 
Peterson in an office interview. 
</P>
<P>
As to the parcel that the city is renting from Olson, Peterson said: "I'm 
buying time and space. I told him that I wanted to make some studies and 
surveys . . . My intent was to stall what could have been an adverse use of the 
land by Mr. Olson. We didn't want him leasing it to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Olson agrees with National City's decision to extend the Mile of Cars to his 
property and concurs that the trailer park is an eyesore. He is presently 
embroiled in a legal attempt to break the lease with the trailer park owner, 
charging that the owner has failed to live up to the terms of the lease 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slim Possibility 
</P>
<P>
However, the possibility is slim that Olson will succeed in settling the legal 
dispute before National City acquires his property, which Peterson said could 
happen within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
National City officials argue that the trailer park leaseholder "has the 
majority interest" in Olson's property. "Mr. Olson owns the land, but the 
leaseholder stands to lose a bigger financial sum when we acquire the 
property," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city would offer a bigger settlement to the leaseholder than me," said 
Olson. "I own the property, but apparently that doesn't mean much in this 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Olson, who admits to being a poor businessman, earns only $2,200 a month rent 
from the trailer park. The park owner charges $227 per space, earning about 
$253,000 per year. Peterson does not deny that the park owner will end up with 
a healthy profit, whether the city buys the property or acquires it through 
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how the city acquires Olson's property, Peterson said that 
officials will probably have to buy the tenants' trailers and pay their 
relocation costs. He said that city officials have not estimated the value of 
Olson's land or the cost of moving 93 families. But he "assumed" that the 
majority of the families would qualify for subsidized housing, which would be 
paid for with federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prepared to tell you what we're willing to offer Mr. Olson," said 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
He said that placing two car dealers on Olson's property would be "consistent 
with the city's long-range redevelopment plans." Besides, it would make good 
business sense to extend the Mile of Cars to the border with Chula Vista, where 
a scheduled off-ramp from California 54 will provide easy access to National 
City's most famous landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mile of Cars is National City's breadbasket. National City is a poor 
community. National City needs the Mile of Cars. National City needs the Mile 
of Cars to pay its bills. Putting two car dealers there (on Olson's property) 
would be the most economic and productive use of the land," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
He strongly denied suggestions by Olson that the city is prepared to "give 
away" the land in order to attract two more car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Done Deal? 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years we have severely discounted land to new car dealers in order to 
attract their attention . . . We gave in order to get an investment. But we 
don't do that anymore. The Mile of Cars is a profitable institution and there 
are many dealers who want to put their business on National City Boulevard . . 
. When we acquire (Olson's) land, it will be sold on a competitive basis, for 
its fair market value," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
At times Peterson and other city officials talk about acquiring Olson's 
property as if it were a done deal. By law, the redevelopment agency has to 
schedule public hearings before acquiring the land, but Olson charged that will 
merely be a formality. 
</P>
<P>
"This would also have to be approved by the Planning Commission. But that's all 
cut and dried. They've already made up their minds. They're going to take my 
property away one way or another . . . All these years of sacrificing, making 
payments on the land while I was raising a family. None of that matters. I know 
that I'm going to end up with a pittance," Olson said.

It was business as usual along the San Luis Rey River. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many property owners before him, H. Von Packard Jr. wanted to make good 
use of his land, which cozies up to the river as it winds through Oceanside. So 
he hired a bulldozer and plowed down a dense thicket of willows, cattails and 
other stream-side vegetation covering part of the 42-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Yoder, a state fish and game warden, didn't like what he saw. No permits 
had been issued. No permission had been granted. But before the state could 
take action, the bulldozer leveled more than a dozen acres of prime riverfront 
habitat that played host to numerous animals and birds, including a tiny, 
endangered songbird, the least Bell's vireo. 
</P>
<P>
Packard argued that he simply wanted to farm the land, to plant tomatoes. 
Authorities, however, were unimpressed, slapping him with misdemeanor charges 
of altering a river without first informing the state. They were even less 
impressed when Packard later submitted plans to Oceanside for a 77-house 
subdivision on the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Settlement Reached 
</P>
<P>
After months of wrangling, a settlement was reached in January. Packard would 
spend $30,000 to replant 1,000 trees and native plants in exchange for the 
charges being dropped. For the birds and beasts that had called the ungainly 
grove their home, peace and order would return. 
</P>
<P>
It was an upbeat ending to a tragic environmental tale, but that small victory 
in Oceanside is exceedingly rare. Up and down the arid expanse of Southern 
California, the ribbons of green oases stretching along the banks of rivers and 
small tributaries are under an unceasing assault by man. 
</P>
<P>
Known as riparian areas, these ecologically valuable acres of river bank 
vegetation have increasingly fallen prey to farmers and developers, to 
bulldozers and buzz-saws, often making room for concrete channels, shopping 
centers and houses. 
</P>
<P>
"They're vanishing rather rapidly, I'm afraid, especially in Southern 
California," said Bob Radovich, a state Fish and Game Department biologist. 
"And the loss only seems to be accelerating." 
</P>
<P>
In California, only 10% of the riparian areas that once existed still stand 
today, authorities said. The destruction is not abating. Along the coast of 
Orange and San Diego counties, 40% of the stream-side vegetation that thrived 
just a decade ago is now gone, state wildlife officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Examples are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of a thoroughbred horse farm and a sod-growing operation in southern San 
Diego County have pushed into swaths of riparian vegetation in the Tijuana 
River, maintaining they were simply reclaiming land lost to flood waters years 
earlier. To the north, a tomato farmer decimated riparian habitat along the San 
Dieguito River east of Del Mar to expand his field, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the destruction is far more vivid, albeit 
decades old. From the largest river to the tiniest tributary, concrete channels 
long ago replaced river bank vegetation that once brimmed with plant and animal 
life. But the streams that remain unfettered by such flood-control projects 
increasingly feel the strain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A National Problem 
</P>
<P>
Troubling as it is, the destruction of Southern California's riparian areas is 
only one example of a greater problem -- the disappearance of wetlands 
throughout the United States. From the vanishing Everglades to the dwindling 
salt marshes of San Francisco Bay to the plains of North Dakota, where farmers 
are plowing over important wildlife sanctuaries known as prairie potholes, the 
hand of man is invariably being felt. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a national issue," said Nancy Kaufman, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service official who headed the outfit's Laguna Niguel office until earlier 
this year. "While you can look to San Diego County and Southern California for 
examples, it's not as if the region is out of step with other sections of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
But while many of those other areas have attracted a vigilant pack of public 
protectors to do battle against transgressors, the riparian areas of Southern 
California enjoy few stalwart allies other than a handful of dedicated 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people realize what riparian areas are and that they're 
threatened," said Sharon Lockhart, an adjunct biology professor at San Diego 
State University. "I think it's really tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, few people seem to grasp the ecological significance presented by a 
scruffy thicket of willows and cottonwoods perched on the banks of a babbling 
brook. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like a lifeline, particularly in our semi-arid environment," said 
Emily Durbin, a Sierra Club leader in San Diego. "Just as much as aqueducts are 
lifelines for us, rivers are lifelines for animals and birds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Roles 
</P>
<P>
Aside from serving as pivotal way-stations for animal and plant life, riparian 
areas play an important role for man. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the streams serve as settling pools to recharge Southern 
California's vital ground-water system. Moreover, the vegetation on the river 
banks acts like a sponge during heavy rains, holding back heavy flows and then 
later releasing the water slowly. 
</P>
<P>
With stands of cattails, bulrush and other plants and trees, riparian areas 
contribute air to breath and also serve as Mother Nature's very own sewage 
system, helping naturally metabolize certain wastes such as farm runoff and 
fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
"These sorts of wetland areas are important not just for wildlife, but for a 
variety of other things," Kaufman said. "Society is going to have to pay a 
great deal of money to compensate for these losses. There's a lot at stake, and 
it's not just endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
The river stretches also are flush with more animal and plant life than perhaps 
any other ecosystem in Southern California, experts say. Opossum, skunks and 
coyotes frequent riparian areas. Hawks and other birds of prey roost in the 
trees. The pockets of green also serve as stopping-off points and nesting 
grounds for a plethora of migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
"Riparian areas are not as well understood, they're not as obvious," said Dave 
Bontrager, an independent biological consultant and avid bird watcher. "It 
takes a little closer look. But, boy, once you look! 
</P>
<P>
"Take the Santa Margarita River (on Camp Pendleton). That riparian corridor is 
just fantastically diverse. We used to joke that everything in Southern 
California nests there, and if doesn't yet, it will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pointing Fingers 
</P>
<P>
Why are they disappearing? Advocates outline a variety of reasons, but 
typically point to the federal agency they feel is the prime culprit -- the 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state has some regulatory weapons to go after riparian abusers, as 
it did with Packard, the onus for enforcement typically falls on the Army 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the corps has consistently failed to halt the destruction of 
the river bank habitat. Roundly vilified by environmentalists as "the dam 
building agency," the corps is philosophically misplaced as a guardian of the 
environment, acting instead as a toothless watchdog, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The blame lies at several levels, all the way from the cities and counties on 
up," Lockhart said. "But I think the corps is one of the greatest 
disappointments. . . . It's akin to the fox watching the hen house." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service said they can point to 
more than 200 instances in the last decade where illegal grading and fill work 
occured in riparian areas in Southern California, but the Army Corps failed to 
do anything. Instead, the agency typically followed up by issuing 
after-the-fact permits, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Army Corps officials said such numbers seem to stretch the truth and argued 
that their mandate is to carefully balance environmental considerations against 
other concerns, among them the rights of private property owners to develop 
their land. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish and wildlife people are good folks, but they're a single-purpose 
agency," noted Perry Davis, Army Corps spokesman for the Southern California 
branch. "Their interests are among many we have to look at. We have to look at 
all the environmental concerns, then balance those to some degree with the 
economic returns and other things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pretty Good Job' 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he is aware of "situations where we have issued cease-and-desist 
orders on people who were illegally filling and made them not only stop, but go 
in and return the land to the condition it previously was in." 
</P>
<P>
"Given the limitations of our staff, I think we've done a pretty good job," 
Davis said. "I suppose there may be cases where things slip through the cracks, 
but we try to keep that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
At times, however, the corps has appeared all too cozy with developers, critics 
contend. Perhaps the most troubling example occured in Las Virgenes Creek in 
northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the agency issued a cease-and-desist order to a development company 
that had ripped out between three and eight acres of riparian habitat to 
construct a flood channel near an apartment project. Leaders of other federal 
agencies, however, were angered when they later learned that a Army Corps 
regulatory official privately told the builder to ignore the order and finish 
the project, suggesting a permit for the work would be issued later. 
</P>
<P>
But the corps is not the only agency singled out. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman worries that the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which helps 
oversee the wetlands, has abrogated too much of its regulatory responsibility 
to the Army Corps. In only a handful of cases has the EPA stepped in and used 
its powers to reverse a corps decision, most notably in 1987 by nixing approval 
of a dam that would have inundated the pristine Pamo Valley in northern San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Oshida, regional chief of the EPA's wetlands section, said the agency 
has been hindered in the past by staff limitations, but hopes that more headway 
can be made with the Bush administration's appointment of William K. Reilly, a 
noted environmentalist and wetlands advocate, as top administrator at the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was a shot in the arm for the wetlands protection program," Oshida 
said. "He has already mentioned that wetlands is one of his top priorities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inadequate Regulations? 
</P>
<P>
Radovich, meanwhile, suggests that it is the regulations, and not the 
regulatory agencies, that are probably most to blame for the unceasing 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the corps of engineers or their staff necessarily," he 
said. "I just think there is not adequate regulation placed on development in 
riparian areas in California." 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the rich river bank groves has occured mostly on a 
piecemeal basis, fueled by state and federal laws that put few roadblocks in 
the way of landowners eager to clear vegetation on smaller parcels of 10 acres 
or less, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal rules often call for the replacement of riparian areas lost to 
development, such mitigation sometimes falls through the cracks on smaller 
projects, officials contend. Even when requirements for replacement habitat are 
set out, the regulatory agencies often fail to follow up and ensure the job is 
done, Kaufman said, estimating that 80% of the mitigation work is never 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
Some destruction isn't even covered under the regulations. A property owner can 
typically skirt the rules by clearing trees and plants with a chain saw, taking 
care to avoid filling the stream channel, which is protected under federal 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lockhart argues that the regulations are biased against the arid 
West. Many riparian areas in Southern California, she said, fail to pass "the 
wet tennis shoe test" (if the ground is wet enough to squish up around your 
tennis shoe, you're in a wetland). In the eyes of federal regulators, these are 
not true wetlands, no matter how great their value as environmental 
sanctuaries, and are summarily rejected for protection. 
</P>
<P>
Farming is often allowed to encroach on the riparian areas, even though the 
rules allow growers to till only land that has historically been in 
agriculture. Kaufman said the loophole is sometimes exploited by developers. A 
builder clears a river bank for farming, then a few years later can more easily 
push through plans for a subdivision or shopping center because the land is no 
longer considered a riparian area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasons for Destruction 
</P>
<P>
Property owners offer a variety of reasons for destroying the prime habitat. 
Often they contend they're reclaiming land seized by the river, such as the 
landowners on the Tijuana River. Others suggest they were simply unaware of the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
But even landowners who known the rules sometimes go ahead and bulldoze the 
trees and bushes, anticipating little more than a slap on the hand from lax 
regulatory agencies, critics contend. 
</P>
<P>
"You have people who just don't care," Lockhart said. "Because the corps 
doesn't do anything to people like them, they go ahead and do what they damn 
well please." 
</P>
<P>
All that grading and filling and cutting can create a variety of problems. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of flood channels, for instance, typically halts the flow of sand 
down rivers to replenish Southern California's eroding beaches, many experts 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, heavy development along a river decreases the land's ability to soak 
up rainfall, causing increased runoff into streams. The bolstered flows 
dislodge silt that can settle in areas of tangled river bank vegetation, 
choking out all life. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you will have a failure of these environments if enough of 
their component pieces are missing," Kaufman said. "It is true that we will 
never know what good something is if it's not around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, city leaders in Southern California have not been allies in the 
fight against riparian destruction, but that may be changing, particularly in 
San Diego County, considered by many the last bastion for unfettered river bank 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner and county Supervisor Brian 
Bilbray, officials are gearing up to spend $10 million in state funds to 
purchase riparian areas along the Tijuana River. 
</P>
<P>
A special task force is also engaged in an ambitious effort to restore habitat 
for the least Bell's vireo, which is on the U.S. endangered species list. In 
addition, various officials are pressing an ambitious effort to form a park 
along the San Dieguito River Valley in North County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Awareness 
</P>
<P>
What else can be done? Radovich suggests a shift is needed toward increased 
public awareness of the problems with dwindling riparian areas and tighter 
restrictions on river bank encroachments. 
</P>
<P>
"It boils down to a political process and increasing public concern and 
increasing protective capacity for the areas," he said. "It has to be far 
reaching. It doesn't mean just drawing a line along the side of a stream. We 
have to look at whole watersheds and manage them appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
Oshida of the EPA said the agency hopes to increasingly work with local 
governments to plan around riparian areas and have an influence on zoning 
decisions, which can affect the development potential on river banks. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he suggested that riparian protection efforts don't have to occur just 
on the federal level. California could make its own regulations tougher than 
federal laws, he said, and the regional water quality control boards that 
blanket the state could handle the task of enforcing the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Lockhart, meanwhile, maintains that the most profound impact could be made by 
giving the EPA the responsibility and the staff to regulate the federal wetland 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
With riparian areas disappearing fast, changes need to be made soon, experts 
contend. The future of numerous species of plants, birds and animals could 
depend on reversing the current destructive trend. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of what good any particular species is, there are all the great old 
stories, you know, you don't take your engine apart and say this piece looks 
insignificant and throw it away, because your engine probably won't work," 
Kaufman said. "As a human being living in this environment, I know my options 
are being extinguished along with these species."

PRINCIPAL TO TAKE MESSAGE OF PRAISE TO INNER-CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, with the smell of nearby agriculture heavy in the air, the principal 
of Valley Center Middle School was perched on the banister outside a school 
bungalow, cajoling the kids to hurry into the classroom to begin working with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Paul White hopes instead to be roaming the dingy hallways of an 
inner-city school, applying his enthusiasm and sense of mission to a whole 
school full of low-achieving students rather than to one or two classes. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Messianic White hasn't enjoyed his special sixth-period sessions, 
where he liberally mixes praise with criticism while moving among the 16 
seventh-and eighth-graders, checking their progress in other classes, offering 
help on a writing or math assignment, and scolding those who have not yet 
organized their schedule to finish longer-term projects on time. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts -- in addition to the normal routine of a principal -- have turned 
around the academic world of these students, many of them minority and all of 
whom previously achieved at low levels. Every one of the youngsters volunteered 
for the daily class that White created to employ more of his many ideas about 
helping at-risk students. 
</P>
<P>
But White no longer is satisfied with his accomplishments in Valley Center, a 
North County citrus and avocado center which, despite pressures of population 
growth in recent years, has far fewer of the big-city problems such as 
dropouts, drugs and child abuse that bedevil urban schools. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old White wants to be administering at an inner-city school next 
fall, leaving behind the 600-student middle school where teachers and 
administrators from urban districts fiercely compete for occasional openings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applications Are Out 
</P>
<P>
In February, White resigned his Valley Center post effective June 30, despite 
entreaties from district administrators urging him to stay. White has applied 
for positions with several urban school districts around the country and while 
he has no firm offers yet, his confidence in landing a desired job stems from 
the same philosophy he drums into his students. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell myself what I tell every kid I've ever counseled," said White, whose 
devotion to education has touched every staff member in Valley Center, whether 
they agree or disagree with his tenure. "I don't believe that God would give me 
or anyone else the capabilities that we have and not allow us to apply them to 
our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Superintendent Jeff Mulford, who as the previous principal hired 
White as his assistant, said, "I've never met anyone quite like Paul . . . he 
has no personal time constraints, he takes kids on trips, he's practically 
adopted a few." 
</P>
<P>
Continued Mulford: "Most of us spend our lives trying to get to a place like 
Valley Center," pointing to the school's high test scores, few discipline 
problems, as well as attractive physical plant of large playgrounds, a pool, 
and an experimental farm. The school district, with the middle school and two 
elementary schools, is about 65% white and 35% minority, consisting of Latinos 
and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"But Paul sincerely believes that he can do more for mankind by going to the 
inner-city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Run for His Money' 
</P>
<P>
Patty Christopher taught several years in urban schools, including Baker 
Elementary in Southeast San Diego, before coming to Valley Center. Now the 
assistant principal, she said that White "is going to have a real run for his 
money in handling an urban school." 
</P>
<P>
"Those schools can really use someone like Paul . . . and I think it's great 
that people like him are willing to try." 
</P>
<P>
But White recoils from being labeled as idealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is the lowest blow you can give me," he said. "Calling me 
idealistic is to write off people like myself. Realism is believing that all 
schools can offer productive education and that all students can be 
productively educated." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, White did not make his decision unaware of the pitfalls in urban 
areas. Before coming to Valley Center as an administrator, he spent eight years 
in Vallejo, a blue-collar city north of San Francisco, motivating so-called 
"problem" elementary students. 
</P>
<P>
In Vallejo he honed the approach that has won him plaudits from students and, 
albeit grudgingly at times, from colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
White calls his style "surrogate kitchen-table parenting." 
</P>
<P>
When he first started teaching, White found himself intrigued that while 
parents are able to talk to and discipline their children and still receive 
affection, teachers and administrators have always found it hard to correct 
kids and still command respect. 
</P>
<P>
"But it dawned on me that parents achieve because when things go well for a 
kid, the child gets limitless congratulations," White said. "So as a teacher I 
can give out hard-rock discipline when necessary, but also there is no limit to 
my praise if they do well, either." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came on a Friday two weeks into his first class, a 
hard-to-discipline group about to be dismissed for the weekend. White was 
explaining that he never leaves the house without telling his wife that he 
loves her, because he never knows if that might be the last time he sees her. 
</P>
<P>
"So I told the class I wanted them all to have a good weekend and that I loved 
all of them," White recalled. "At first, I thought they might think I was the 
biggest idiot in the world, but instead, you could have heard a pin drop in 
that class. 
</P>
<P>
"And after that, I never had problems. But the first commitment was mine, that 
I was willing to let the kids know that they are loved, but also that I was 
there to peer over their shoulder, as a parent should, and keep them in line as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walks a Fine Line 
</P>
<P>
Mulford said that White walks "the fine line between discipline and caring 
about as well as anyone I have seen. He plays the parent role beautifully and 
the kids know that he is sincere." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Valley Center teacher Donna Sowers praised White for helping students 
understand how to organize their study and how to take responsibility for their 
work. Colleague Taide Pereyra said White has devoted more of his own time and 
money to working with students than anyone she has seen. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll shake them up wherever he goes because he is always giving 150%," 
teacher Val Taylor said. "They'll either love him or hate him." 
</P>
<P>
If White has shortcomings, Sowers and others said any faults come from 
impatience. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think that he might have been better off to stay here another 
year, to learn more about building relationships with the staff similar to 
those easily exemplified in those he has with the kids," Sowers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand he has a strong mission to succeed, but I think that every person 
on a staff has a similar mission, but may go about it in a quieter way." 
</P>
<P>
Mulford said that the transition from assistant principal to principal is 
difficult because the top position presents a much broader spectrum of ideas 
and requirements in working with people. 
</P>
<P>
"But Paul has no personal ego involved and I think he has grown tremendously," 
Mulford said. 
</P>
<P>
White himself said that administration "is an ongoing lesson" and that he has 
learned that more can be accomplished when credit is spread liberally. But at 
the same time, he said that "nothing will change (at a school) unless I and 
everyone else will change and give our best efforts. . . . in too many cases, 
we haven't given our best efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"My strongest calling is to be with the most difficult kids and I, along with 
everyone else, must be willing to pay the cost and personal sacrifice involved 
in education." 
</P>
<P>
Mulford has applied to school districts in Santa Ana, Los Angeles, Whittier, 
San Francisco, Oakland, Memphis and Detroit. His three letters to Oakland were 
never answered and his three to Detroit resulted only in a mimeographed flier 
giving details on substitute teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess those experiences are indicative of the problems that education has," 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
But both San Francisco and Whittier have responded with interest, he said. 
White had an interview in the Bay Area this past week and will be part of a 
second round of interviews in Whittier for an opening as principal of a 
continuation high school. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where I go, there will be no magic to what I do -- just hard work, 
sacrifice, going toe-to-toe with students, rewarding students, in essence 
breaking down goals into workable parts and getting everyone involved," White 
said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THE TODAY SHOW LEAVES TRAIL OF MISINFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's said you should never expect too much from a car built on a Friday. Maybe 
the same is true for morning television shows. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Today Show has left town after its Friday show at Embarcadero Marine Park 
near Seaport Village in San Diego. If Bryant Gumbel is still writing memos, he 
should have plenty to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, the show spent more time talking about Tijuana and looking at 
Coronado than dealing with San Diego, good, bad or indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Park, the Old Globe, the bio-tech pioneers, downtown renaissance -- 
forget it. Problems with water pollution, a dangerous airport, the debate over 
a proposed border ditch -- not interested. 
</P>
<P>
The show started with Jane Pauley herding Maureen O'Connor, Helen Copley and 
Joan 
</P>
<P>
Kroc into a joint interview with a pointless premise -- San Diego is run by 
women! Women who know each other!!! 
</P>
<P>
It got worse. 
</P>
<P>
A listless Top Gun segment, Willard Scott clowning at Sea World, Jane and 
Bryant doing a Johnny Carson schtick with zoo animals, and a carping interview 
with the University of California president about Asian-American enrollment. 
The symphony helped but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Among the gems of misinformation: 
</P>
<P>
* UC will soon have an enrollment where minority group students make up the 
majority (Gumbel). Dead wrong. 
</P>
<P>
* There are no fences along the U.S.-Mexico border (Pauley). Oh, really? Tell 
that to the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
* Tijuana has a population of about 500,000 (Pauley). Try three to four times 
that many. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Jolla is a charming community close but separate from San Diego (Scott). 
Arghh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monkey Business at Zoo 
</P>
<P>
 There are monkeys at the San Diego Zoo. And jackasses, too. 
</P>
<P>
When four Colombian spider monkeys arrived from Venezuela in February, a monkey 
handler named them Adolf, Mengele, Eva and Frieda. The four had been hiding in 
the South American jungle, get it? 
</P>
<P>
The names were put into the computer inventory system and the animal file 
cards, although the names were never displayed to the public. 
</P>

Since a reporter's inquiry last week, the names have been erased and three zoo 
employees are in hot personnel water. Zoo officials had been unaware of the 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not acceptable, not funny and will never happen again," said zoo 
spokesman Jeff Jouett. He declined to identify the employees or say what will 
happen to them.

Real Life, but Not Hers 
</P>
<P>
Jean Alliece Colston told a gripping tale at the San Diego Crime Stoppers 
luncheon last week of how her son and daughter were killed by drug gangs in 
Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The room grew quiet and Colston's voice filled with emotion. Her son was slain 
in the streets, and her daughter, pregnant with twins, was fatally shot while 
riding with her in the car, Colston said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience gave a standing ovation as Colston, 46, chairwoman of the newly 
formed MAGIC (Mothers Against Gangs In Our Community), called for an end to the 
plague of violence. 
</P>
<P>
People rushed to Colston to offer condolences and admire her courage. She was 
quoted in news stories about the luncheon, where Sharon Rogers and Joyce Knott 
also spoke. 
</P>
<P>
There is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Colston, a resident of Southeast and director of the San Diego College of 
Retailing, doesn't have a daughter and her sons are alive and well. She has 
never had a family member killed by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Colston told a reporter the day after the speech that she had only been trying 
to dramatize for her audience the real-life stories that she was told by the 
mothers of gang victims. 
</P>
<P>
She said she thought her audience would realize what she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to jar people awake, and maybe I did it too well," she said. "Next 
time, I'll either say something at the beginning about these being stories I've 
been told, or make one of those statements from the Crime Stoppers television 
spots: This is a reenactment."

GETTING POLITICS OUT OF POLITICS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The results of the 1990 census still are more than two years away and that 
loathsome creature, the gerrymander, already has reared its ugly head and is 
peering around at the political landscape. The gerrymander is the symbol of 
legislative reapportionment, the redrawing of legislative district lines to 
reflect population changes, or more to the point, malapportionment, the 
creation of contorted election districts designed to assure control by one 
party or the other. 
</P>
<P>
A curious coalition that includes self-annointed populist Paul Gann, former 
Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post and the League of Women Voters already has 
begun to circulate an initiative petition that would take reapportionment out 
of the hands of the state Legislature and give it to a 12-member bipartisan 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The plan sounds simple enough and fair enough. To many, it will seem to solve 
the eternal good-government riddle of getting politics out of reapportionment. 
The commission would review plans submitted by anyone and choose the one that 
best satisfies the requirements of the proposed initiative. Ah, therein lies 
the catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Gann-Post-League plan contains a complex, detailed set of criteria designed 
to create compact and highly competitive legislative and congressional 
districts. This is a noble goal, and the process dictated to the commission by 
the initiative might create perfect legislative districts geographically. But 
they may not be the best districts politically. Reapportionment, after all, is 
a political process and it is impossible -- and not necessarily desirable -- to 
remove politics from it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
First, the process stipulates the usual general criteria of a legally 
acceptable reapportionment plan: geographical compactness, maintenance of 
community of interest and fair representation for minority groups. But the 
initiative then goes to much greater lengths in an attempt to achieve seemingly 
perfect districts. No district can cross certain common boundaries, like the 
Santa Barbara-Kern and Ventura-Kern county lines. No district may cross a 
county boundary more than once. Cities cannot be fragmented. District lines 
cannot be drawn around a population center to get at another population center, 
according to this formula: "Each Assembly and congressional district shall 
contain no less than 60% of the population which would be contained in a 
polygon with the shortest possible perimeter drawn around that Assembly or 
congressonal district." 
</P>
<P>
After all that, the initiative then requires that, to the extent possible, 
districts shall not deviate in voter registration by more than 2% from the 
statewide proportion of registered Democrats to Republicans. Present districts 
vary wildly from that formula now, in part because Democratic legislators drew 
the lines to maintain control in a maximum number of districts and minimize the 
impact of Republican votes by lumping as many GOP voters into safe GOP seats as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
The idea purports to wring partisan politics from reapportionment. Perhaps. But 
the result still will be partisan, and will not necessarily represent the best 
common sense. Geographic compactness does not always reflect communal 
interests. Sections of some cities often have more in common with areas beyond 
their borders than they do with other areas in their own town. Neat lines do 
not guarantee equity. The geographic criteria of the initiative could isolate 
minority groups into enclaves that deny them their share of representation. 
</P>
<P>
California voters have rejected reapportionment commission proposals twice 
before in this decade. They would do well to maintain a healthy skepticism of 
anyone who offers a plan to get politics out of reapportionment.

MEDICARE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to the editorial "Correction in Medicare Course" 
(April 25). 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the editorial's report, the expected surplus from the Medicare 
Catastrophic surtax is due to the fact that Congress underestimated the number 
of middle-income retirees who will be affected by this law. 
</P>
<P>
Any Medicare eligible individual age 65 or older with a tax liability of only 
$5,400 (a taxable income of just $27,573) will be required to pay the maximum 
surtax of $800 in 1989. Medicare eligible couples with a joint tax liability of 
just $10,800 (a combined income of approximately $52,384) will have to pay the 
maximum surtax of $1,600 ($800 a piece) in 1989. These are not wealthy people. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, these same middle-income people must pay regular income taxes 
(federal annuities are fully taxed) in addition to the Medicare surtax. As a 
result, many of them are being pushed up into the 50% tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
If senior citizens are required to pay for schools, day care and aid to 
dependent children, causes which do not apply to them, why should they not get 
relief from the imposition of legislation which they do not want nor need and 
which will benefit less than 16% of them? Those who consider the Medicare 
Catastrophic Act to be "a good program and a health insurance bargain" simply 
haven't done their homework and are telling all the world so.

DERSHOWITZ ON PRENATAL RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Drawing the Line on Prenatal Rights," by Alan Dershowitz, Op-Ed 
Page, May 14: 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to Dershowitz, I am appalled by his position advocating 
state intervention in a woman's body once she has made the decision to bear a 
child over having an abortion. I also am a human rights activist, one perhaps 
who has been silent far too long! I am sure Dershowitz would have a different 
view on state intervention if the fetus in question was within his male body as 
opposed to the body of a woman. 
</P>
<P>
No government entity should have the right to dictate what one does with the 
inner sanctity of one's body -- suggest, educate, recommend, yes, but not 
intervene. Pregnant women are the first step in government intervention within 
the privacy of our bodies. Who will be the next target? Diabetics, cardiacs, 
hypertensives -- perhaps only allowed to order from a "special menu" in a 
restaurant or shop in a "special section" of the market -- by state 
intervention on the individual's behalf? Once unleashed, where will government 
intervention stop? Dershowitz has allowed himself to be manipulated by the 
right-to-life movement and, in so doing, has lost sight of what constitutes a 
democracy!

PARTS FLY OFF TRAIN IN NEWHALL, CAUSING DAMAGE, NO INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Lemmon, manager of a car repair shop next to the railroad tracks in 
Newhall, thought children were throwing rocks when he heard a series of loud 
bangs outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
But the four-inch bolt that shot through the shop's open garage door put a hole 
in that theory. And the seven-pound chunk of twisted metal he found in the 
street could not have been the work of pranksters. 
</P>
<P>
The debris and about a dozen other large pieces of metal that showered cars and 
buildings in Newhall on Saturday came from a cooling fan that flew off a 
passing freight train locomotive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shards Damage Cars, Businesses 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but at least two parked cars and a number of businesses 
were damaged by the flying shards, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Kathryn 
Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the train coming, and all of a sudden the building was pelted by 
pieces of this aluminum fan," Lemmon said. "It was like shrapnel flying 
everywhere. I'm surprised nobody got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Lemmon said an eight-inch piece of metal came within inches of hitting a 
pedestrian on the sidewalk outside his business, in the 24300 block of Railroad 
Avenue. The shop is about 75 yards from the railroad tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said shards also shattered the window of one parked car and sheared off the 
side-view mirror of another. A large piece of the fan tore a hole in the side 
of the Anawalt Lumber hardware store on the other side of the tracks, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fan Discovered Missing 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies radioed the crew of the northbound train thought to have 
caused the incident, said Jerry Pera, a spokesman for Southern Pacific 
Transportation Co., which operates the trains. The train stopped several miles 
north of Newhall, and crew members discovered that a fan was missing from the 
top of the third locomotive, Pera said. The train was being pulled by four 
locomotives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members, who were all in the lead locomotive, told inspectors that they 
were unaware of the incident, Pera said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 2 1/2-hour inspection, the train was permitted to continue its trip 
from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Pera said. The cause of the incident was 
under investigation, he said.

UNEASY NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR 4 FAMILIES, LIFE NEXT DOOR TO INDUSTRY MEANS CONFLICT, FRUSTRATION, OFTEN 
FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One woman awoke to layers of flour coating her van; another became afraid to 
walk to her neighborhood market because of the hordes of day laborers loitering 
on her corner. A son's pet rabbit died, and a father lost faith in city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
What these four people from the San Fernando and Simi valleys have in common is 
that they live next door to industry. Ask them and their families what that 
means and they talk of irritation, frustration and fear. 
</P>
<P>
They share interrupted sleep, hot summers with windows closed and back yards 
they say are useless. They log daily diaries of annoyances that they think may 
violate city, regional or state laws. They worry about the health of their 
children and their pets. 
</P>
<P>
All four thought they were alone in their troubles until they started talking 
with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
They say they are living proof that housing and industry make poor neighbors, 
prompting conflicts that far outweigh typical neighborhood gripes about traffic 
or ruined views. In fact, residential areas next door to industrial zones may 
be the most graphic examples of poor community planning, some Los Angeles and 
Simi Valley city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact is that most of these planning-department and 
zoning-department folks who make land-use decisions don't take into 
consideration how the use might affect the general area," said Richard Baldwin, 
district director for the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Months or Years of Complaining 
</P>
<P>
Once problems begin to occur, people who live next to industries find it takes 
months or years of complaining to municipal and regional officials to gain even 
partial satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We assumed that someone, that the city, was watching out for us, but it's not 
true," said Margaret Whittington, whose Sylmar farmhouse now backs onto a 
construction supply lot. "It took us six years to find out the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Los Angeles and Simi city planning officials said, heavy industry 
should be separated from residential areas by buffer zones of lighter 
industrial and commercial zones. They said many of the incompatible uses began 
long before city zoning and planning laws included safeguards to prevent 
pairings between people and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the land-use conflicts arise historically," said Emily Gabel, a Los 
Angeles city planner. "They've been used for a long time, and no one knows the 
history of why any longer." 
</P>
<P>
But all four of the residential areas included in this story predated the 
industrial areas next door, and all but one of the families -- the Haggarts, 
who moved into a World War II-era trailer court three years ago -- remember 
when fields were their neighbors instead of factories. 
</P>
<P>
In three of the cases, the industries were allowed to locate near residences 
under city zoning. Only Apache Building Materials in Sylmar started up without 
full city approval. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest solution to the conflicts, suggested by some city officials, is 
for either the residents or the industries to move. In hindsight, Simi Mayor 
Greg Stratton said he wished that a spa manufacturer, which subjected a 
neighborhood to almost daily chemical odors for more than a year, could have 
been directed to a heavier industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
"If this thing had located near the sewer plant, no one would have noticed," 
Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Penny Newmark, who heads a group called Residents Against Pollution, 
thinks that separating industrial and residential areas is a Band-Aid approach, 
particularly where air pollution is involved. Instead, she said, companies 
should be forced to be more responsible neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"Moving industries from residential areas does not take care of the problem," 
Newmark said. "It will just give these companies an opportunity to do the bad 
things they're doing, to put more pollutants out into the air, because no one's 
there to monitor it." 
</P>
<P>
The four families either do not want to move or cannot afford to move, or both. 
Here are their stories: 
</P>
<P>
The day Chomper the rabbit died, his owner, Adam Haggart, 9, was the first to 
find him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good day until that happened," Adam said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cause of death was never determined, Adam blamed the metal-casting 
company next door, which had allowed odors to escape near Birmingham Trailer 
Village earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The brown and white rabbit was buried next door to the double-wide mobile home 
in Van Nuys, where Adam lives with his parents, Bruce and Diane Haggart. 
</P>
<P>
On a piece of weathered plywood, Adam scrawled Chomper's epitaph: 
</P>
<P>
 "R.I.P. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here lies Chomper 'Ruby' 
</P>
<P>
 "1986-1989 
</P>
<P>
 "Murdered by Coastcast Co." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastcast Co. has since been cited twice by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District for emitting odors and smoke. However, officials with the 
air quality management district and Coastcast think the odors were caused by 
burning wax in an overheated furnace, not by toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
But Adam's immediate assumption underscores one of the realities of living next 
door to industry: fear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Fear 
</P>
<P>
Fear creeps into the Haggarts' lives when the flowers they plant outdoors die. 
Fear returned when Diane started having chronic headaches, when Bruce had 
frequent nosebleeds, when Adam was put in a special physical education class 
because his motor skills were impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is we have problems," Diane said. "It could be related; it might 
not be." 
</P>
<P>
Coastcast plant manager Ted Rauch said the company shares the neighbors' 
concerns about health effects, especially since their workers also are exposed 
to any chemicals in even greater concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had the health board in here, and they haven't cited us; we're not in 
any violation that we're aware of," Rauch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Haggarts thought they knew what they were getting into when they moved into 
the Balboa Boulevard trailer court four years ago. They had lived in another 
park on Woodley Avenue that also was surrounded by industry. As Bruce Haggart 
put it, "There should be no reason people and companies can't get along." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noise Problems 
</P>
<P>
At their old home, their major complaint was noise, which the company reduced 
whenever they protested. When the Haggarts first moved to the Birmingham 
trailer court, noise was the only problem there, too. 
</P>
<P>
But after about a year, Diane Haggart said, she saw workers from the factory 
next door -- then owned by Rex Precision Products -- pour something she thought 
was chemicals into Bull Creek. When she walked over to investigate, she said, 
she stepped into a white puddle that splashed onto her right leg and caused 
blisters. She said she did not know whether it was the same substance she saw 
being poured into the creek. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Precision Products was taken over by Coastcast in 1987 and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Haggarts said that they started to see a sticky film on their car, and that 
during the rainy season, silt that had accumulated on their roof would trickle 
down the side of the trailer and erode its finish. 
</P>
<P>
Awhile later, they started noticing a cloying, metallic odor from time to time 
that prompted them to close all their windows and doors, even in the hot 
summer. In January, the odor became suffocating, Diane Haggart said. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd close everything up, and it would still seep in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One night, Diane Haggart walked over to try to talk with Coastcast employees 
about the stench. She said they threatened to call police and charge her with 
trespassing, although company officials deny the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the Haggarts' emergency phone list has included numbers for the 
air quality management district, the Los Angeles Fire Department's hazardous 
materials team and Residents Against Pollution. They have been frequent callers 
to all three numbers. 
</P>
<P>
They are frustrated with the slow pace of the enforcement process and feel 
stuck because they can't afford to move. At least six of their neighbors have 
posted "For Sale" signs in their windows. 
</P>
<P>
People said Valerie Hofmann treated her red Ford van like a child. She bought 
it personalized license plates imprinted with its name, Mad Max. On Sundays, 
she spent two hours outside her Canoga Park home, scrubbing the van inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Then, nearly every Monday morning, Hofmann said she awoke to find Mad Max 
covered with flour that had drifted across her back fence from the Mission 
Foods Corp. tortilla factory. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just want to weep," Hofmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Hofmann stopped washing her van, and she stopped using her back yard, too, 
because the noise from the processing plant drowned out conversation and the 
air was filled with a heavy tortilla odor. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, flour clouds and loud noises are rare and only a slight odor of 
masa, the corn mash used to make tortillas, lingers. She has an air-filtration 
system in her house, compliments of Mission Foods, and neighbors meet monthly 
with company executives to discuss any remaining problems. A company complaint 
hot line is staffed 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unfailingly Polite' 
</P>
<P>
"We had to beat them over the head to get their attention," Hofmann said. "But 
once we did, they've been unfailingly polite and responsive." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Foods Vice President Raymond Hansen said the relationship changed from 
confrontational to constructive after a new management team in 1987 came in 
with orders to solve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
But Hofmann said the Variel Avenue residents succeeded in forging a working 
relationship with Mission Foods by banding together and persevering. They 
started what they call a "telephone tree" -- one neighbor calling several 
others who in turn called others -- to make sure that the air quality 
management district and other agencies received plenty of complaints when there 
was an odor, noise or flour problem. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the air quality management district inspector was being sent out to the 
area so often to investigate complaints that Hofmann and her neighbors knew him 
on a first-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13 Citations 
</P>
<P>
By November, 1986, Mission Foods had received 13 air quality management 
district citations for noise and emissions. Within a year, the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office also filed charges against the company, which ended in a 
$3,400 fine and the agreement to meet monthly with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
When Hofmann moved into her home 15 years ago, the land that now is Mission 
Foods was an open field where, she believed, more houses would be built. The 
first indication she had that plans had changed was construction of a small 
tortilla factory. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Mission Foods bought the company and more than tripled its size, 
Hofmann said she never thought of moving because she loves her house. But at 
the peak of the problems, she did boycott Mission Foods products. 
</P>
<P>
"I was buying chips and dips one day with my sister and she picked up Mission 
Foods chips," Hofmann said. "I told her, 'I can't believe you would buy them, 
especially in front of me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now Mission Foods hands out free chips at their monthly neighborhood meetings, 
and Hofmann said she has become quite fond of them. 
</P>
<P>
"They do make the best chips, you know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in the neighborhood crept up slowly on Margaret Whittington, whose 
Sylmar farmhouse now backs onto a construction supply lot. 
</P>
<P>
When she and her husband first rented the house on Paddock Street in 1978, the 
lot behind them was fields all the way to San Fernando Road, with a one-story 
plumbing business at the far end. Over the years, it became a storage yard that 
just "grew and grew and grew," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning construction supply business created troubling problems, 
Whittington said: diesel fuel fumes wafting into her bedroom at 4 a.m., heavy 
trucks barreling down her street that have squished neighborhood pets, and 
cement mixers grinding all day. 
</P>
<P>
But those irritations proved less intrusive than the day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of men -- up to 200 some days -- line up hoping to get hired by one of 
the contractors who buy supplies from Apache Building Materials. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine hundreds of men loitering in a location where we've not had that 
before," Whittington said. "They're eating, drinking coffee, reading newspapers 
and leaving trash in our yards." Because there are no bathroom facilities 
nearby, "our yards became their toilets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Followed 
</P>
<P>
Worse than that, Whittington said, is the array of crime that followed the 
laborers. There are prostitutes and drug dealers on the corner, trying to 
interest the workers in their wares. There has been a rash of petty theft in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It has really changed the tone of the area," she said. "Women used to be very 
comfortable walking anywhere. I used to walk to the store on the corner all the 
time. But I don't do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Repeated calls to Apache Building Materials were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has staged several raids in the 
area, Whittington said. After a raid, only 50 to 75 men will show up at first, 
she said, "then it'll take a couple of months to build back up again." 
</P>
<P>
Because Whittington and her husband, Edward Wagner, are renters, moving would 
have been easier for them than for homeowners on their street. But they have 
invested time and money in fixing up the house, and they have forged solid 
relationships with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Fight 
</P>
<P>
So Whittington decided to fight. For a long time no one from the city seemed 
interested in her story, she said. But finally last year, after Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi got involved, the city Building and Safety Department forced 
the construction company to pare down its storage of supplies and move its 
cement-mixing business to a nearby area zoned for heavier industry. 
</P>
<P>
When it looked as though the city would go no further, Whittington joined with 
several neighbors to file a public-nuisance lawsuit. They have postponed 
further action on that suit, awaiting word from the Los Angeles city attorney's 
office on what action the city will take. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'You've gotten so much already, why not just be satisfied?"' she 
said. "But that's not my way." 
</P>
<P>
Disillusionment with city government has been the hardest thing for Chas Hill 
to accept. 
</P>
<P>
He never thought twice when a spa manufacturer took over a tire warehouse about 
300 yards from his Simi Valley home in late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay our taxes to get the city to protect us," Hill said. "You would think 
you could rely on your city to clump any problem industries all together, away 
from houses." 
</P>
<P>
When he and his neighbors started noticing a pungent, glue-like odor in the 
late afternoons, they assumed someone around the corner was working on a boat. 
</P>
<P>
But the odor didn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Styrene Fumes 
</P>
<P>
When one of the neighbors traced it to fumes from styrene, a liquid resin used 
to make fiberglass spas at Hydro Systems, Hill turned to Simi Valley City Hall. 
He expected immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we should have just been able to say, 'We've got a smell over here,' 
and they would solve it," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what came next were public hearings, numerous neighborhood petitions, 
protests and testimony in court. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, the mayor, said the city tried to address the problem as quickly as 
it could but found it lacked the specialists to determine the best solution. 
</P>
<P>
In Hydro Systems' defense, Vice President Larry Burroughs said the firm "spent 
a lot of time and a lot of money" researching taller smokestacks, which is a 
common solution to styrene odors. But he said the city rejected that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution that failed was an attempt to chemically mask the fumes with 
less offensive scents. For a while, the afternoons smelled like bubble gum. 
Then they smelled like baking bread. 
</P>
<P>
But, Hill said, the alternative scents just made him more aware that the 
problem persisted. And his wife, Grace, said all of the scents -- including the 
styrene -- ruined the taste of food, "like when you put an onion under your 
nose and eat chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talked of Moving 
</P>
<P>
For several months last year, the Hills talked about moving from the home they 
bought in 1972. They even sat down and penciled it out financially. But Chas 
Hill said his two sons -- ages 11 and 14 -- have established friendships in the 
neighborhood and that he hated to make them leave. 
</P>
<P>
Under an order from the city, Hydro Systems in October installed charcoal 
filters that were supposed to remove all the fumes. The Hills acknowledge that 
the styrene odor comes less often now and is not as strong, but at least once a 
week Grace Hill notices -- and reports -- it. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs said the lingering odors are unrelated to the filter system, which he 
thinks is working. Instead, he said, the company has traced complaints to such 
things as outdoor garbage cans, doors left open and trucks hauling styrene 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
But the continuing odors make Chas Hill throw up his hands in dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"You just start to feel that the system overlooks the big guy," he said. "This 
probably makes me less of a good citizen, because of the frustration of this."

RASH OF DUBIOUS ACTS PROMPTS TALK OF ETHICS REFORM BY LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee was following a tradition of inaction 
when it decided last week not to investigate whether Assemblywoman Cathie 
Wright (R-Simi Valley) violated ethics rules by intervening with authorities on 
behalf of herself and her daughter for traffic offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came out of the committee's first meeting in four years. Under the 
Legislature's narrowly drawn Code of Ethics, the panel can only consider cases 
when a lawmaker's action allegedly results in direct personal gain "which is in 
substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the public 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
The committee has no full-time staff and few resources. During its 23 years, it 
has dealt with only a handful of cases and has never recommended a substantive 
disciplinary action. Its rules appear to be written to be as exclusionary as 
possible, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
"The legislative Ethics Committee has been a joke," said Walter Zelman, 
executive director of California Common Cause, a citizens watchdog group. "It 
hasn't done anything for years. It defines its purview extraordinarily 
narrowly." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's days as the only ethics enforcer in the Capitol, however, may 
be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret Probe 
</P>
<P>
The highly publicized revelation last August that the FBI has been conducting a 
secret probe of legislative corruption since 1985 prodded state lawmakers to 
take a major step beyond leaving it up to law enforcement agencies and voters 
to judge their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Since February, an Assembly Select Committee on Ethics has been grappling with 
a series of thorny questions: 
</P>
<P>
Should those who write the laws be held to a higher standard than simply not 
breaking them? If so, what should those standards be? And, given lawmakers' 
reluctance to sit in judgment of colleagues, who should enforce such rules of 
appropriate conduct? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, amid widespread allegations of official wrongdoing and growing public 
mistrust, should laws governing elected representatives be toughened? 
</P>
<P>
"There are conducts which currently don't involve any law that we have, which I 
would deem inappropriate and not smart," Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara), who chairs the Assembly ethics committee, said in an interview. "I 
think we're short of standards of what's appropriate behavior." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley alone, disclosures in the past 15 months have called 
into question standards of appropriate behavior: 
</P>
<P>
Wright interceded with judges, police and the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles to seek special treatment for herself and her daughter on traffic 
offenses, according to Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. His 
probe criticized the assemblywoman and various government agencies but found 
"no clear-cut criminal violations." 
</P>
<P>
Potential donors who received calls from campaign fund-raisers for Assemblyman 
Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) said they were pointedly advised that Bane chairs or sits 
on legislative policy committees that regulate their professions. Scientists 
seeking grants from a medical research board headed by Bane's wife said they 
were also aggressively solicited. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) lent more than $1 million in campaign funds to 
business associates involved in real estate deals, staffers and community 
organizations between 1984 and 1987. An investigation by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp found Robbins had broken no state laws but said the loans spotlighted 
the need for clearer legal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Citing an absence of criminal wrongdoing, the Valley lawmakers maintained that 
they had done nothing wrong. But the question remains: Should such actions be 
permitted? 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos' committee is grappling with such sensitive issues. The 
eight-member panel is expected to recommend changes in laws, new rules and 
adoption of an ethics education program for legislators and an internal or 
external enforcement mechanism, members said. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest hurdle is drafting something substantive, practical and adoptable; 
something that serves both to address the concerns of the public and does not 
curtail the appropriate actions of legislators," Vasconcellos said two days 
before the committee held its third of four public hearings last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Limit Possible 
</P>
<P>
Among the possible proposals is a further limit or a ban on much-criticized 
speaking payments from special-interest groups. California legislators 
augmented their income with $1,441,096 in such honorariums during the 1987-88 
legislative session. State Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), one of the few lawmakers 
who does not accept such fees, calls them "thinly disguised bribery." 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos' committee may also support more stringent restriction on the 
personal use of campaign funds. Van de Kamp is advocating this reform in a bill 
prompted by the Robbins inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to call for banning loans of campaign funds except to 
charitable, religious and educational groups and to require that any 
expenditure that creates a substantial personal benefit be primarily for a 
political, governmental or legislative purpose, Fred Woocher, Van de Kamp's 
special counsel, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If the select ethics committee adopts a tough program -- as Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), one its eight members, predicts it will -- it still must steer 
it through an Assembly loath to give up its prerogatives or invite increased 
oversight. Some veteran observers say this will only happen if public interest 
and media pressure are intense. 
</P>
<P>
"They will pass as little regulation as they feel is socially acceptable," 
predicted Michael Josephson, a 
</P>
<P>
former law professor and founding president of the nonprofit Joseph and Edna 
Josephson Institute for the Advancement of Ethics, in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers' reluctance to judge colleagues is reflected in the Joint Legislative 
Ethics Committee. The committee considered the Wright matter Thursday at Dist. 
Atty. Bradbury's behest. Acting on the advice of the legislative counsel, it 
decided that Wright's contacts with authorities on her daughter's behalf did 
not fall under the committee's narrowly drawn jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), the Ethics Committee's vice chairman, 
expressed what appears to be widespread sentiment, saying, "Probably the law 
ought to be broadened." 
</P>
<P>
Ethics experts note that the increased concern with standards of proper conduct 
is hardly unique to the California Legislature. In fact, ethics seems to be the 
pervasive issue of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Consider ex-U.S. Sen. Gary Hart's personal indiscretions; the conviction of 
Wall Street stock speculator Ivan Boesky and indictment of "junk bond" king 
Michael Milken; the transgressions of television evangelists Jim and Tammy 
Bakker; the conviction of numerous ex-officials of former President Reagan's 
administration and the Iran-Contra arms deal. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, of course, headlines have been rife with the House Ethics 
Committee's charges that House Speaker Jim Wright violated House rules to 
enrich himself. And, closer to home, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley faces 
numerous investigations for alleged conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole ethical climate in the country is changing," said Robert M. Stern, 
former general counsel to the state Fair Political Practices Commission and 
author of an article titled "Ethics in the States." 
</P>
<P>
Stern is an advocate of legislative reform. But he nonetheless wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Our legislatures are a mirror of our citizens, and their ethics are probably 
far superior to the ethics of the average businessman, labor leader or pillar 
of the community. How many citizens can be audited by the Internal Revenue 
Service and not owe any money? How many of our citizens would turn down money 
in exchange for a favor (a vote)?" 
</P>
<P>
And reforms have been enacted. The voter-approved 1974 Political Reform Act, 
which Stern helped craft, prohibits a public official from participating in or 
using his position to try to influence any governmental decision in which he 
"knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest." 
</P>
<P>
The act established the Fair Political Practices Commission to oversee the law 
but exempted lawmakers from prosecution on conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
The act also requires each legislator and candidate for office to file periodic 
statements of economic interests, disclosing investments, interests in property 
and income of themselves and their immediate family. Public disclosure is 
generally viewed as a deterrent to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, adopted by voters last June, limits campaign contributions from 
individuals, political action committees and political parties, and bars 
officeholders from accepting honorariums exceeding $1,000 from a single source 
in a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brighter Spotlight 
</P>
<P>
Still, the growing sums of campaign contributions, gifts, trips and speaking 
fees showered on state legislators by PACs have brought an outcry from 
public-interest watchdogs such as Common Cause and the media. Disclosure of the 
FBI sting operation -- which this month resulted in the indictment of Sen. 
Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) on racketeering, extortion and money-laundering 
charges -- gave the issue greater urgency. 
</P>
<P>
"The system doesn't really do too much to encourage its members to do the right 
thing," said Daniel Lowenstein, a UCLA professor and former chairman of the 
FPPC who advocates changes including a vigorous ethics committee and further 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson, who runs ethics programs for politicians, journalists and business 
people and publishes a magazine on ethics, offers this yardstick for measuring 
an official's integrity: 
</P>
<P>
"Has he or she done anything to affect his or her ability to exercise 
independent judgment" or create the appearance that his or her autonomy has 
been compromised? 
</P>
<P>
He maintains: "Simply because it's permissible doesn't make it proper." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson said this applied to actions allegedly taken by Cathie Wright, Bane 
and Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dist. Atty. Bradbury found that Wright had committed "no clear-cut 
criminal violation," Josephson called her reported efforts to help her daughter 
avoid penalties for traffic violations "a classic case of the use of influence 
in the most tempting of circumstances. People view loyalty to their family as 
above all else." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "If, in fact, she would have done that for any constituent, she 
has misunderstood her obligation as a legislator. Our system doesn't call for 
the legislator to interfere with other government agencies carrying out their 
duties. It's like putting your fingers on the scales of justice." 
</P>
<P>
Reported efforts by Bane's solicitors to raise campaign funds by pointedly 
telling prospective donors that the assemblyman is in a position to influence 
their interests, if true, "are extortionate and coercive," Josephson said. 
</P>
<P>
"All giving ought to be free and voluntary. Any time there is an implicit or 
direct threat, it takes away from the voluntary-ness, and makes it a payoff. He 
benefits from the illusion that they're at least protecting themselves" by 
contributing to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Josephson said, "Whatever powers the legislator has, we're all 
entitled to them. I don't have to give him a nickel. In fact, I can oppose him 
to the hilt, and I should still be entitled to his representation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Funds Defined 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' use of campaign funds as loans to business associates -- a practice 
that the senator no longer engages in -- was wrong because "it's using funds 
supposedly designated for a narrower use for a personal use," Josephson said. 
"Campaign funds are meant for campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, using the money for non-campaign purposes encourages 
lawmakers to raise ever larger amounts from special interests, "which expands 
the field of indebtedness and the potential for abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Given the Legislature's reluctance to delve into the touchy realm of moral 
self-regulation, Josephson, Lowenstein and Stern all said vigilance by the 
media is a deterrent to ethics abuse. And, in the end, the voters periodically 
pass judgment on their lawmakers. Scandal has been the undoing of most of the 
small number of California state or federal lawmakers who have been defeated in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, state Sen. Davis says things have improved since his first 
eye-opening visit to Sacramento in 1953 as a Los Angeles police representative. 
He recalled that a veteran lobbyist confided the initiation rite that the 
lobbyist and a colleague employed with rookie legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker would be taken to an out-of-the-way road house and asked, "Will 
you play ball with us?" 
</P>
<P>
If the official responded affirmatively, he was instructed to reach under the 
table, grab a wad of bills from the lobbyists' plain black bag and discreetly 
pocket the payola. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday," the lobbyists advised, "we'll come back to you, ask for a favor, and 
give you another grab."

MINUS SEGOTA, SOCKERS OPEN AGAINST BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a bright side, it is only that Branko Segota probably got a little 
extra sleep while his Socker teammates boarded their early-bird flight to 
Baltimore Sunday morning at 6:45. 
</P>
<P>
Segota, the heart of the offense with a team-leading 13 playoff points, will be 
in San Diego tonight when the Sockers open the best-of-seven Major Indoor 
Soccer League championship series against Baltimore in the Baltimore Arena at 
4:35. 
</P>
<P>
Segota aggravated his hamstring injury Saturday while running start-and-stop 
sprint drills. He will undergo rehabilitation this week and hopes to be ready 
for Game 3 in San Diego Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't feel I could contribute to the team right now," Segota said. "I 
didn't want to go there and just mope around and get the other guys down." 
</P>
<P>
Past games against Baltimore indicate expectations shouldn't plunge in Segota's 
absence. The Sockers had their best outing against the Blast in a game Segota 
missed, winning, 7-1, at Baltimore in the second-to-last meeting of the regular 
season. Interestingly, starters Brian Quinn and Zoran Karic also were out that 
game. All three were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Though Segota's presence usually causes some worry to opponents, who mark him 
with two defenders when he is within scoring range, the Sockers have never 
worried much about what to do without him. In simpler terms, they won't make 
excuses. 
</P>
<P>
Before the playoffs started, Quinn said: "In the end, they're not going to say 
it was won by Baltimore but San Diego didn't have Branko Segota. After all the 
dust is settled, they don't write that in the record books." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, six-time indoor champions can't expect sympathy. Particularly from a 
Baltimore team with eight players who, at one time or another, have faced the 
Sockers and lost in a championship series. So the Sockers are planning to 
adapt. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to pick up the slack," midfielder Waad Hirmez said. "Having 
(Segota) on the field frightens the other team. We'll have to depend more on 
teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
And consistency. Intensity was up and down during the Dallas series and, as a 
result, the Sockers barely escaped, clinching in Game 7 with a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn's observation during the semifinal series was that not enough of the 
Sockers were entering the locker room tired after games. 
</P>
<P>
"That's true," defender Kevin Crow said. "Everybody should be walking in that 
locker room drained. That's the sort of attitude you need." 
</P>
<P>
The Blast, which defeated the Sockers in six of eight regular-season games, 
might not let them survive intensity lapses. Baltimore was well prepared from 
the start this season, taking players from several defunct MISL franchises last 
summer and building a team strong enough to jump to an 8-1 start, best in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Never deposed from first place, the Blast went on to defeat Wichita in six 
games in its semifinal series to earn its shot at the defending-champion 
Sockers. Home-field advantage should help Baltimore, which is 11-2 against the 
Sockers in regular-season games at home. 
</P>
<P>
Known for its balanced attack, the Blast blends offensive strength from forward 
David Byrne and midfielder Carl Valentine with defense led by goalie Scott 
Manning. Manning, in particular, has been tough on the Sockers this season, 
holding them to 11 goals in the first five games.

LANGSTON SHUTS DOWN PADRES IN HIS EXPO DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since last winter, the Padres had longed for the day when Mark Langston 
would pitch at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
That day finally came Sunday, but Langston was wearing the wrong uniform. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had done all they could to acquire the left-handed Langston, 28, who 
had been placed on sale by the Seattle Mariners because his $1.3-million-a-year 
contract will run out at the end of the season. But he wound up with the 
Montreal Expos Thursday in a deal for three young pitchers, and the Padres 
suffered the additional indignity of being the first National League team to 
face him. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-2 score by which the Expos humiliated the Padres only began to tell how 
dominant Langston was. He pitched one-hit ball for six innings, and didn't give 
up a run until his working margin had reached 8-0. He left after eight innings 
with a four-hitter and 12 strikeouts, and one of the two Padre runs was 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the Padres did a lot to embarrass themselves in front of a packed 
house of 48,023, lured in large measure by a postgame concert by the Beach 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching of Eric Show and Dave Leiper was a perfect match for the Padres' 
anemic hitting, and Leiper made a terrible situation worse with a throw to 
third base following a rundown that ranked with the wildest on record. 
</P>
<P>
Even a member of the Padre coaching staff got into the act. Sandy Alomar Sr., 
directing traffic at third base, put a fitting finish to the lamentable 
performance by sending Carmelo Martinez home from second base on Tim Flannery's 
single with the Padres eight runs behind. Martinez was an easy game-ending out. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Martinez summed things up by saying, "I hope the Beach Boys put on a 
better show." 
</P>
<P>
As Martinez suspected, the second half of the doubleheader was far more 
entertaining than the baseball game. Still, anyone with a keen eye for pitching 
had to be impressed by Langston. And anyone with the Padres' interests at heart 
had to wonder how good they would be if they had landed him. 
</P>
<P>
From the time Langston reached an impasse in contract negotiations with the 
Mariners, he had been the object of a manhunt that spread over both major 
leagues. Since he could have become a free agent this fall, the Mariners 
couldn't wait to unload him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Expos will lose Langston if they can't sign him, but as Manager 
Buck Rodgers put it, "We're going for it in '89. Anything after that will be a 
bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Since Langston is a native of San Diego -- he moved to Santa Clara at the age 
of 4 -- and has expressed displeasure over going to Montreal, there is still 
hope among Padre diehards that he will come here eventually. However, Padre 
Manager Jack McKeon is not among the optimists. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to think that if they're trying to win a pennant, he'll be with them 
quite a while," McKeon said. "Maybe if they're out of the race by September, we 
might see another deal, but I doubt if that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Of all people, the only San Diego player to get a hit off Langston in the first 
six innings was Show. The Padre pitcher took advantage of one of Langston's few 
mistakes by lining a double to right field in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Even on that count, though, Langston had the last laugh. This was the first 
time he had ever batted in the majors because of the designated-hitter rule 
used in the American League. And he got the first hit of his career -- also his 
first run batted in -- in his fourth and last time at bat. It was a single to 
center off Leiper. 
</P>
<P>
"That hit definitely made my day," Langston said. "It was a pretty wild 
experience. It looked pretty ugly. I was just trying to put the ball in play. 
Now I can put it on my mantel." 
</P>
<P>
Langston is a switch-hitter, and his hit came on his first swing batting 
right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
As for his pitching, he said, "I was really excited to be with a new team and 
with a big crowd. The guys went right out and scored some runs, so I could take 
a deep breath. We got the crowd out of it real early. It was my job to keep 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Langston probably could have finished without difficulty, but he said, "I was 
getting a little tired. I really didn't want to pitch the ninth, because I 
don't like to go over 130 pitches (He threw 138). If it had been a close game, 
it would have been different." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers offered a second reason for calling in closer Tim Burke, who has nine 
saves, to finish the game." 
</P>
<P>
"Burke hadn't worked in almost a week," Rodgers said. "I wanted to give him an 
inning to keep him sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Show (6-5) was gunning for a Padre record of 93 victories -- he is tied with 
Randy Jones -- but it became apparent in a hurry that he wasn't going to get 
it. He yielded one run in the second and two in the fourth, then served up a 
three-run homer to Tim Raines in the fifth. By that time, the frustrated fans 
were booing loudly and often. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach was the Expos' big bomber, tying a club record with three doubles. 
</P>
<P>
How good was Langston? Just ask some of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Flannery is a left-handed hitter who normally plays only against right-handed 
pitchers. But he was pressed into service because of Randy Ready's leg injury, 
and looked back on it as quite an experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Any left-hander is tough for me," Flannery said. "Even Jimmy Allen, our 
batting-practice pitcher, gives me trouble. But Langston is one of the toughest 
I've ever seen. He's always ahead of you, so you're always hitting 
defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark said, "He's like a left-handed Dwight Gooden. He's a great pitcher 
-- not a good one, a great one." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The 10 runs scored by the Expos set a season record for Padre opponents. The 
previous high was nine. Said Padre Manager Jack McKeon: "This was our first 
blowout all year." It came on the first anniversary of McKeon's debut as 
manager after the firing of Larry Bowa. . . . Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said 
the trade for Mark Langston couldn't have been made but for a surplus of talent 
in the Montreal farm system. "It's a tribute to our scouting and farm 
department that we've developed players other clubs want."

FOR SYMPHONY, DAY AT BALLPARK IS A LOT OF WORK 
</P>

<P>
Most people react to the strains of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" with a genial 
vision of basking in the bleachers with a beer in one hand and a hot dog in the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
But to San Diego Symphony's operations director, Andrew Cady, the song brings 
to mind the logistical nightmare of setting up the orchestra's annual stadium 
concert before a Padres game -- without ever setting foot on the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the symphony plays outside Symphony Hall, Cady and his crew bear the 
burden of creating a suitable performing environment for the 81-player 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a bigger challenge than setting up a quintet of bluegrass 
players," said Cady, who should know, since he spent his first years out of 
college as a concert promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the county's usually benign weather, performing outside can provide 
daunting challenges. Cady recounted a near catastrophe when the orchestra 
performed last summer in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"The industrial park is on a windy mesa near the airport, and a sizable Santa 
Ana wind was blowing the day we were to play. The heat wave was so severe, it 
fried out our stage crew. Two of our guys literally dropped while setting up 
for the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when the setup was accomplished, the wind picked up to 50 to 60 miles an 
hour, and we had to quickly take down the fiber-glass shell we had put up under 
the blistering sun because we were afraid it would blow into the audience. In 
its place, we circled up our vehicles around the setup -- fortunately we had a 
big box van with us -- in an effort to create wind protection for the 
orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
That concert started 15 minutes late because the crew was still screwing down 
all the music stands to the plywood stage floor at curtain time. But, Cady 
noted ironically, a change of wind direction after sunset, which brought in 
cool ocean air, left symphony players shivering by the concert's end. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has played to audiences as large as 20,000 at a concert before a 
baseball game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- about 10 times the number of 
listeners at a Symphony Hall full house. 
</P>
<P>
However, setting up at the stadium presents some unique challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"The groundskeeper there will shoot you if you touch the grass," said James 
Hoffman, the symphony's personnel manager and principal percussionist. "We have 
to put down plywood sheets in front of us, like pontoon boats across a river, 
in order to get our trucks onto the infield, where we set up. You can't just 
drive up and unload your equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Cady said that because a pregame concert is on an extremely tight schedule, the 
crew can do the entire setup in 52 minutes and strip it down in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Outdoors, the major consideration is acoustics," Cady said. "The acoustical 
value of our shell is such that we can reach the first 1,000 people in an 
outdoor setting without amplification. Beyond that we have to 'lift' the music, 
which is the same situation as our summer site out at Hospitality Point. We 
close-mike the entire orchestra with some 25 microphones, and run it all back 
to a sound board." 
</P>
<P>
Cady said that shielding the players and their instruments from direct exposure 
to the sun is another problem. Many musicians, he said, especially the string 
players, have a second instrument for outdoor gigs. No prudent orchestra member 
would allow his $50,000 cello, for example, to bask in the sun for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the orchestra's instruments to an outdoor site is not a major problem, 
Hoffman said, because only a few of the larger percussion instruments, such as 
the timpani and tubular chimes, are owned by the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
When the orchestra plays without benefit of a stage, such as at Rancho 
Bernardo's Concerts on the Green series, Cady's crew puts down a temporary 
wooden floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a double skin of plywood over the ground to give a smooth surface, 
particularly for the bass players and the poor cellists," he said. A former 
cellist, Cady easily sympathizes with a cello's end pin sinking into the damp 
sod. 
</P>
<P>
For someone thinking about having a symphony instead of a sextet for alfresco 
serenading, the base price is $17,500. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we ask for a program that is already rehearsed -- for instance a 
'run-out' of one of our summer pops concerts," Cady said, adding that a 
custom-designed program needing rehearsal time would increase the cost 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the San Diego Symphony's road performances have been within San Diego 
County, but the group has in the past crossed the border to play at Tijuana 
Cultural Center. Typical venues are Chula Vista's Ocean View Park, country 
clubs in Rancho Bernardo and La Costa.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: CHANNEL 10 FINDS THERE'S NO 
EMMY IN THE WORD TEAM

Swen Net won't win an Emmy this year, and Paul Sands is upset about it. 
</P>
<P>
When he was told that the local chapter of the National Academy of Television 
Arts and Sciences, the sponsor of the Emmys, wouldn't accept "The 10 News Team" 
as Channel 10's entry in the spot news category for coverage of the Craig Peyer 
verdict, Sands, the station's news director, submitted the name of Swen Net. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Swen Net at the station; it's simply Ten News spelled backward. 
</P>
<P>
No dummies at NATAS, though; they figured it out. When the nominations were 
released last week, Sands alone was listed as the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
"When we issue the call for entries, it includes a booklet that sets the rules 
and regulations," NATAS chapter administrator Jonathan Dunn-Rankin said. "The 
rules are very specific about what is allowed. It doesn't allow an Emmy to be 
awarded to any entity or a station." 
</P>
<P>
That just made Sands even more angry. More than 20 people worked on the 
coverage, Sands said. He feels it is unfair to nominate one without nominating 
all of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, he could have entered all the names -- at $75 a person. 
</P>
<P>
"The award should not go to me or the station (if the entry wins), but to the 
team of people who put it together," Sands said. "But their arbitrary rules 
make it impossible." 
</P>
<P>
In the editorial category, Sands thought it appropriate for all five members of 
the station's editorial board, who participate in the formation and writing of 
all editorials, to be listed as nominees. But NATAS rules require that only the 
general manager and editorial director receive awards. 
</P>
<P>
Sands said he even offered to pay for the extra statuettes in the editorial 
category. But rules are rules, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly galling to Sands are the thousands of dollars each station spends 
to enter and attend the awards ceremony each year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question it's a fund-raiser for the organization, we just assume 
that," said Danny Mendez, KNSD-TV director of news services, who believes that 
the only way to improve the awards is for all the stations to work together. 
"Short of changing the structure of the contest, there's really nothing to be 
upset about." 
</P>
<P>
But Sands is upset, particularly with the unbending nature of the award 
regulations. He wants to raise the issue of whether his station should 
participate in the awards in the future. 
</P>
<P>
He joins KFMB-TV (Channel 8) News Director Jim Holtzman, who has never been a 
fan of the local Emmys. The annual competition is open to all television 
productions in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Holtzman said this year he gave his staff the option of using the money 
budgeted for the awards on something else, but the staff opted to enter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that it is always set up or judged in the right way," said 
Holtzman, who has not attended the awards ceremony in eight years. "It's much 
ado about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Sands simply wants NATAS to recognize the individuals who deserve to be 
recognized. "Let's not make the rules the reason for the games," Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn-Rankin said Sands is free to petition the NATAS board of directors to 
change the rules next year. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM (91X) has sent a letter to local stations warning them against trying 
to give away tickets to the upcoming Who concert, an exclusive 91X event. The 
station has prepared legal materials "designed to allow judicial action within 
24 hours in the event of any attempt by another radio station to engage in a 
ticket giveaway," the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to do much of anything" with the Who, said Tom Baker, general 
manager of KGB-FM (101.5), the station most likely to promote the Who. "The 
fact we're playing the Who is promotion enough." 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a prudent measure on their part," KCBQ (Eagle 105) General 
Manager Jeff Apregan said. "I think they've done their homework." 
</P>
<P>
Another station's promotions director was not so impressed. "I'm appalled," he 
said. "I thought it was really unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
More than 428 entries were received for this year's local Emmys. There are 216 
nominees in 56 categories, with KNSD-TV (Channel 39) leading the list with 69 
nominees, followed by Channel 8 with 52 and Channel 10 with 33. "First 
Tuesday," a show for Instructional Television, the educational channel 
available on cable, was nominated for an impressive seven awards. . . . Channel 
8's hourlong special on the homeless Thursday night was excellent, a rare 
chance to see the human beings behind the political rhetoric. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar resident Chris Engholm, author of the recently released "The China 
Venture: America's Corporate Encounter With the People's Republic of China," 
was a guest on the Financial News Network last week discussing the country's 
current political turmoil. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the "radio and TV personality" category is any indication, the San Diego 
Business Journal's annual list of "Big Hitters" is pretty wimpy. According to 
the list, the result of a survey of readers issued last week, the Biggest 
Hitters in local radio and television are KFMB radio's Clark and Cavett, 
Allison Ross, Jack White, Hudson and Bauer, and Clark Anthony (half of Clark 
and Cavett). Of the five, only Channel 10's Jack White isn't employed by KFMB. 
Two hard-charging personalities, KSDO-AM (1130) talk show host Roger Hedgecock 
and Channel 10's Michael Tuck, must be in mourning, having missed being 
included on such a prestigious list. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 is bringing new levels of cheesiness to local television news with 
its annual "Swimsuit Edition," which aired Tuesday night. Such sledgehammer 
ratings-month techniques are commonplace in Los Angeles, where stations attempt 
to out-bikini each other. Channel 10 apparently wants to bring Bikini Wars to 
San Diego. . . . Ex-presidential son Michael Reagan is off the KSDO-AM morning 
news, but he'll soon start a talk show, 10 a.m. to noon Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
KSDO General Manager Mike Shields said Operations Manager Jack Merker is 
expected back June 12. . . . The scene: the UCSD campus, where a group of 
students was due to protest events in China. A Channel 8 cameraman was on hand, 
but only a few demonstrators had gathered, and they were just standing around. 
So the cameraman asked them to do something for the cameras. They shouted 
slogans for a few minutes, asked if the cameraman had enough footage, and then 
stopped. It happens all the time, especially with live broadcasts. The line 
between covering news and staging news is very thin, indeed. . . . As part of 
his continuing attack on Roger Hedgecock, XTRA-FM morning host Mark Williams 
sent a very cordial letter to KSDO inviting Hedgecock to appear on his show. He 
didn't get a reply. Williams called Hedgecock's show on the air last week to 
let a guest know that Hedgecock had been convicted of felonies.

Stress can cause ulcers in animals, too. 
</P>
<P>
Gawking crowds were the main reason why four dolphins at the National Aquarium 
in Baltimore developed stomach ulcers less than two months after being put on 
display in 1981, researchers reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
In a study to be published by the National Agricultural Library's animal 
welfare information center, Dr. Michael Stoskopf of Johns Hopkins University 
said his research shows that light and noise did not appear to play a major 
role in the dolphins' illness, as had been speculated. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem with the exhibit was the people," said Stoskopf, who looked 
at the relationship between about 25 dolphin activities and 15 behaviors of 
human spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The study found the more people present -- and the closer they stood to the 
dolphin pool -- the more often the dolphins engaged in repetitive behaviors, 
such as standing on their tails, indicative of stress. 
</P>
<P>
The aversion to human scrutiny drove the bottlenose dolphins to spend 87% of 
their time in pool regions farthest away from spectators. But Stoskopf said no 
area of the indoor pool enabled dolphins to get far enough away.

ILLUMINATING OR ILLUSIVE?

By JOHN RUBIN, Rubin, who is based in San Francisco, has a Ph.D. in cognitive 
science and writes about mind and brain research. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Learning how electricity works can be a challenge. One helpful trick is to use 
an analogy: electricity flows through wires in much the same way that water 
flows through pipes. Batteries and switches can be thought of as pumps and 
valves. A good analogy allows people to see that a new problem resembles an old 
one that has already been solved. 
</P>
<P>
Cognitive psychologists, however, are finding that using analogies, or at least 
using them well, is surprisingly difficult. Experiments reveal that good 
analogies can be elusive and bad ones seductive. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell University psychologist Thomas Gilovich has shown how poor analogies 
can influence decisions. In one study in the Journal of Personality and Social 
Psychology, Gilovich asked professional sportswriters to evaluate fictitious 
college football players on the basis of short biographies. Players were rated 
higher when they were described as coming from the same hometown as a famous 
professional player. 
</P>
<P>
This result shows that even sophisticated observers can be swayed by an 
irrelevant similarity. The fact that a college player and a professional have a 
common birthplace does not mean they are likely to be analogous in other areas, 
such as football skill. 
</P>
<P>
Gilovich, who is also in charge of graduate admissions for the 
social/personality psychology program, thinks this kind of shallow analogizing 
is a part of everyday life. In college admissions, he says, a certain applicant 
might "remind you of someone who was a disaster or someone who was a terrific 
star." Once the analogy is made, it will bias the candidate's rating even if 
the analogy was based on irrelevancies such as accent or hair style. 
</P>
<P>
No one is immune to unsound reasoning. Recent studies have shown that even 
world leaders have been misguided by weak analogies. Deborah Larson, a UCLA 
political scientist, has studied Harry Truman's relationship with Joseph 
Stalin. At their August, 1945, Pottsdam meeting, Truman remarked to an aide, 
"Stalin is as near like Tom Pendergast as any man I know." Pendergast was a 
Missouri machine boss who helped get Truman elected to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
For some superficial reason -- maybe the way both Stalin and Pendergast would 
pound their fists on a table -- Truman saw the two men as analogous. According 
to Larson, Truman concluded that, like Pendergast, Stalin was a man one could 
deal with, a man of his word. "It led Truman to believe," says Larson, "that 
Stalin would hold free elections in Eastern Europe." U.S. foreign policy in 
this case was shaped in part by a president's idiosyncratic and shallow 
analogy. 
</P>
<P>
While slipshod analogies are all too readily used, another line of research is 
showing that good analogies can be almost impossible to spot. University of 
Michigan psychologist Mary Gick and her colleague Keith Holyoak, now at UCLA, 
asked people to solve the following problem: 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you are a doctor treating a patient with an inoperable stomach tumor. 
Although there is a kind of ray that will destroy the tumor, if it is intense 
enough to do the job, it will also destroy the healthy surrounding tissue. At 
lower intensities, the ray is harmless to all tissue, including the tumor. How 
can the patient be saved? 
</P>
<P>
Before seeing this radiation problem, some subjects read about a general who 
wished to capture a dictator's fortress. Though the general had enough troops 
to win, all roads leading to the fortress were mined. The mines would be 
detonated by the weight of a large column of soldiers, but a small platoon 
could pass safely. The general devised a simple plan. He divided his troops 
into small groups and sent them to the heads of the roads that led to the 
fortress. At a prearranged signal, the troops began to march. The army 
converged on the stronghold and vanquished the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor's quandary in the radiation problem is analogous to the problem 
solved by the general. Once this is seen, the general's solution can be recast 
in medical terms: A number of low-intensity rays could be aimed at the tumor 
from different directions. These beams would damage no tissue except the tumor, 
where their effect would add up. 
</P>
<P>
When given a hint to use the general's solution, most people were able to solve 
the radiation problem. But surprisingly, when no hint was given, only one 
person in five used the analogy to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the psychology laboratory -- where people people are not sensitized by 
being part of an experiment -- analogies may be even harder to spot than that. 
Two Temple University psychologists found that virtually no one notices the 
analogy if unaware that the two problems are part of the same experiment. 
</P>
<P>
So what does it take to get people to use a good analogy spontaneously? 
Clobbering them over the head with it seems to do the trick, as Holyoak and 
Richard Catambrone of the Georgia Institute of Technology have recently shown. 
</P>
<P>
Subjects in their experiment first read two analogous problems and answered 
questions about how the solutions were similar. Next, subjects solved a third 
analogous problem using what they had learned from the first two. Finally, one 
week later, a fourth analogous problem was given to the subjects, who were 
unaware they were in the same experiment. Under these conditions, a large 
majority of people were able to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
One reason a good analogy can be so hard to discover, says Holyoak, is that 
people rely on superficial details more than logical structure. 
</P>
<P>
To support this notion, Holyoak and University of Michigan psychologist 
Kyunghee Koh asked people to read a new problem and its solution: The broken 
filament of a fragile glass light bulb is mended by several weak lasers aimed 
from different directions. Afterward, people tried to solve the radiation 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the earlier experiment featuring the general's problem, most 
people who read about the light bulb were able to make the analogical leap and 
solve the radiation problem without being told to use the light bulb problem. 
The reason, says Holyoak, is that the two problems are more similar at a 
superficial level. Both involve kinds of rays and a delicate substance -- glass 
or tissue -- that must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
It would be comforting to think we could do better than Holyoak's and 
Gilovich's subjects, or, for that matter, Harry Truman in his appraisal of 
Stalin. One approach that might help, says political scientist Larson, is to 
pay closer attention to the causes of events. For example, she argues that it 
is inadequate merely to note that Nicaragua is analogous to Vietnam from the 
U.S. point of view. To avoid errors, we must go one level deeper. "We lost 
Vietnam for certain reasons," Larson says. "Do those reasons hold in 
Nicaragua?" 
</P>
<P>
Another political scientist, Yuen Foong Khong of Harvard University, is more 
pessimistic. "We are beholden," he says, "to the things we are familiar with." 
Khong, who argues that policy makers of the '60s were misled by a bad analogy 
between Vietnam and Korea, says that one pitfall that might be avoidable is 
getting stuck with the first analogy that happens to come to mind. To this end, 
Khong suggests, "you might want to let a hundred analogies bloom. Take all 
contesting analogies seriously and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is no foolproof recipe for sound reasoning. In fact, the ability 
to reason well by analogy might be a rare talent. William James, one of the 
founders of psychology, might have had it right when he wrote a century ago: "A 
native talent for perceiving analogies . . . (is) the leading fact in geniuses 
of every order."

<P>
Scientists researching melanoma reported Thursday that they have found a gene 
responsible for a hereditary form of the deadly skin cancer associated with 
abnormal skin moles. 
</P>
<P>
The gene is associated with dysplastic nevi, larger-than-normal moles that 
change color or shape and are prone to becoming cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 12% of cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma occur in people whose 
families are also prone to the cancer and usually in association with the 
abnormal moles. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, headed by Sherri Bale of the National Cancer Institute in 
Bethesda, Md., located the gene in members of six families susceptible to 
melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
Using molecular genetic techniques and gene linkage analyses, the scientists 
found the gene near the end of the upper arm of chromosome 1 -- the largest of 
the 46 chromosomes in human beings.

'GOOD NEWS' ON SEX AFTER 60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most married women in their 60s not only desire sex but engage in it an average 
of five times a month, a survey of older women shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The news is good for all of us as we approach our 65th birthdays," said Dr. 
Gloria A. Bachman, a gynecologist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry 
of New Jersey. "We found sex is alive and well in older women." 
</P>
<P>
Bachman, in a report presented last week to the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said 59 older women were surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that two-thirds of all married women in their 60s, some of them two 
decades past menopause, are sexually active and many enjoy sex as much as they 
did when they were younger. 
</P>
<P>
Of the women who weren't sexually active, 60% blamed their husbands -- mainly 
citing a lack of interest on the part of their spouses. The husbands, however, 
said the basic reason was impotence or the fear of it.

NAME THAT TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
IN INDIANA, YOU MAY FIND POPCORN, OR EVEN A SURPRISE

POPCORN, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoosiers can lay claim to more than the basketball and corn that comes from 
their homespun state. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a place of note for its many towns and hamlets with quaint names. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, such Indiana spots as Bacon, Bean Blossom, Buddha, 
Chili, Correct and Cumback. 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn? "People have been nuts about popcorn 150 years and more in this town. 
That's why they called it Popcorn in the early days," said lifelong resident 
Oneita Burnette, 60, as she chewed on you know what. 
</P>
<P>
There is a Popcorn church and a Popcorn cemetery, but the one-room Popcorn 
school, the Popcorn general store and Popcorn post office no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Kernel in Popcorn 
</P>
<P>
"I was the last farmer in Popcorn that growed popcorn. I quit in 1980," noted 
Dale Rainbolt, 50, standing under a sign over his front door that proclaimed: 
"Hoosier Homestead Farm Owned By Same Family Over 100 Years. Indiana Historical 
Assn." 
</P>
<P>
Rainbolt said his farm "has been in my family since Andrew Jackson was 
President in 1830. They were eating and growing popcorn way back then in 
Popcorn, Ind." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise in Surprise, Ind.? 
</P>
<P>
It's the sign pointing to tombstones in the local cemetery. Motorists always do 
a double take when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
A sign at the Surprise Christian Church noted that pastor Larry Morris would 
preach on the topic, "Nothing Is Dirt Cheap Except Gossip," at the next Sunday 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise farmer Elmer Grinstead, 79, recalled how he took a load of chicken and 
eggs to market in Indianapolis: "A cop directing traffic downtown saw the 
Surprise, Ind., sign on my truck and told me to pull over. 'Now where in hell 
is Surprise?' he asked me." 
</P>
<P>
In Mongo, Ind., at the Mongo Tavern, owners Wesley (Sarge) Frye, 70, and his 
wife, Loretta, 70, have insisted since 1963 that their customers stand daily -- 
and sometimes even more often -- to sing "God Bless America" with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We sing 'God Bless America' several times a day in the tavern. We love 
America. That's why we do it," explained Sarge, a ringer for W.C. Fields with 
bulbous nose and red face. He was a gunner on a B-29 during World War II. 
That's how he came by his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
The Fryes are patriotic. Their home next door is painted red, white and blue. 
An American flag flies daily outside the tavern. On the Fourth of July and 
Veterans Day, they have patriotic celebrations at their establishment, serving 
free food to anyone who shows up. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the bar is: a photo of Sarge's B-29 and its 11-man crew, photos of B-29s 
dropping bombs over Tokyo (something that Sarge did), a "Proud to Be an 
American" sign and a replica of the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
The jukebox is World War II vintage and has Indiana records of record, like 
"Sunrise Serenade," "I'll See You in My Dreams," "White Cliffs of Dover," 
"Always," "Wabash Cannonball" and "Back Home in Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
Sarge rattles off what he calls Hoosier horse sense, like: "The greatest people 
I ever seen was in World War II." Or: "I'm no better than the guy across the 
street as long as he gives me half the road." And "This station is the best on 
earth, but we're selling it down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
There are three towns in different parts of Indiana named Needmore. 
</P>
<P>
In Park E County, Needmore was an old coal-mining town, named because pioneers 
often said, "We need more coal." 
</P>
<P>
In Needmore in Brown County, they needed more people in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On the town's outskirts is a sign posted on the lawn of an old home: "George 
Ray Fleener. Brown County teacher of the century. 1985." 
</P>
<P>
Fleener is now 95. He recently co-wrote a county history. He was named teacher 
of the century because he founded the Brown County School Board, introduced 
immunization to the county schools, initiated junior high schools locally and 
taught for 45 years in one-room log school houses in Needmore, Branstetter, 
Helmsburg, High Knob, Bear Creek, Cottonwood and Bean Blossom. 
</P>
<P>
He was paid $240 the first year he taught in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dubious Honor 
</P>
<P>
At Needmore in Lawrence County, the late Merle Eddington received from William 
Proxmire, the former U.S. senator from Wisconsin, the Golden Fleece Award in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Eddington won the dubious distinction when he managed to get a $700,000 grant 
to build a replica of the Great Pyramid of Cheops in the old Empire Hole. 
Indiana limestone was mined from the hole to build the Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to have local stone cutters build the pyramid. They built the 
foundation, a museum and gate house. Then they ran out of money. The museum 
burned. Eddington died and his ashes were spread in Empire Hole. 
</P>
<P>
Kokomo, Ind., was named after an Indian chief. Because of its catchy name and 
its history as an old vaudeville stop, more than 20 songs have been published 
about the town. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, the tune "Kokomo, Ind." from the Betty Grable-Dan Dailey 
film, "Mother Wore Tights." There's another popular, 1913 number called "I've 
Got a Gal in Kokomo." 
</P>
<P>
In the Beach Boys' hit tune from the film "Cocktail," Kokomo has been 
transplanted to a place "to get away from it all" -- off in the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
For all its exotic allure, however, Florida would be pressed to match some of 
Indiana's other intriguing town names. Like Gnaw Bone, which was "named after a 
dog gnawing on a bone," insisted Gnaw Bone mayor Glen Roberts, 77, at the local 
sorghum mill. 
</P>
<P>
Fickle, locals said, was named after a family of that name, not some capricious 
person. 
</P>
<P>
As for another curiously named city, "Whenever I tell people I'm from Zulu they 
think I'm from some place in Africa," said garage owner Dean Oberley, 32, a 
fourth-generation Zuluite. 
</P>
<P>
The town, residents said, is named after the Zulu Indians, a tribe of Native 
Americans who since have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Name Game 
</P>
<P>
Down the road from Zulu, Bobo was named after an Adams County judge, James 
Bobo. 
</P>
<P>
Radioville, meantime, got its name from a ham radio operator. Windfall was 
named because tornadoes often sweep through, felling many trees. Sassafras got 
its name from its abundance of sassafras trees, while Solitude earned its title 
because it's a quiet place. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Johnson, 78, a fifth-generation Hoosier, said of her home town, which 
got its name from the sweet smelling hay in the area: "They always laugh when I 
tell them I'm from Aroma, Ind."

MAGAZINES MAKE MOVES ON SOCIAL SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who's checked the in-box for invitations lately will recognize a new 
development on the social scene. Magazines -- not people -- are the new Perle 
Mestas of the young L.A. party world, as well as its arbiters of style. 
</P>
<P>
These new hosts-with-the-most range from big-gun publications like Elle, 
Glamour and GQ to arrivistes like L.A. Style, Details and In Fashion. 
Aggressively trying to promote themselves, the magazines hook up with 
department stores, restaurants, clubs, causes, or even cultural institutions to 
co-sponsor events. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when Bloomingdale's launched its promotion of California 
merchandise, "California: The New International Style," L.A. Style co-hosted 
the opening night party. Earlier this spring, when the Museum of Contemporary 
Art's young support group, the MOCA Contemporaries, wanted to put on a 
fund-raiser, Elle staged a fashion show for the organization at Robinson's in 
Beverly Hills. And Details, the avant-garde New York fashion publication, acted 
as host of the opening of the restaurant Cafe Mambo in Hollywood, even though 
the only bill it footed was the printing of invitations. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Mambo owner Mario Tamayo -- who paid the major bills for food and service 
for that party and others he has produced with the magazine since -- says such 
arrangements are the wave of the future. "It really helps out somebody trying 
to launch a big project," says Tamayo, who has also collaborated with L.A. 
Style and Exposure magazines. "You do it for publicity, as it were," he says. 
"You get press from it; you get celebrities. And people like the idea of 
attending. They want to be a fabulous somebody, and they think they'll get 
mentioned in the magazine." For the Cafe Mambo party, Details gave the party a 
full page of coverage, and L.A. Style and L.A. Weekly covered the event as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Details has become one of the city's most conspicuous party-givers, tossing an 
assortment of events, such as last month's opening of Tamayo's Card Club in 
Hollywood, a nightclub that existed only for the month of April, and a fashion 
show at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills last year. "I learned from 
Interview. Six or seven years ago, they had the hottest parties in New York," 
says Details' Los Angeles-based associate publisher Dan Gershon. 
</P>
<P>
He proudly affirms that aside from providing invitations, his magazine has no 
budget whatsoever for the flood of parties it puts on. "I never pay for 
things," says Gershon, a former rock promoter. Likewise, Tamayo has only on 
occasion taken out advertising in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone Is Happy' 
</P>
<P>
However, Gershon may secure a sponsor for liquid refreshment, such as New York 
Seltzer, an advertiser in the magazine, in return for credit on the invitation. 
"So everyone is happy," says Gershon. 
</P>
<P>
Details' major contribution to an event is its guest list, or rather one of 
three lists of varying social rank which Gershon has stored in his computer. 
There's the triple-A list of 60 top-drawer trendies -- heavily weighted with 
younger members of the press and people ranging from artist Richard Duardo and 
fashion designers Richard Tyler and Mark Eisen to KROQ disc jockey Rodney 
Bingenheimer. Then there's the double-A list of 200 people of secondary 
importance, and the more broad-based A-list of 400 names. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the new forms of direct marketing," says Gershon. "It's reaching 
out to a marketplace of people who do things first. That's 1% of the 
population, and they bring in the 3% behind them of people who do things 
near-first, and that brings in the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Joie Davidow, L.A. Style's executive publisher and editor in chief, says that 
partying is the magazine's sole form of promotion, since it doesn't advertise, 
other than on the occasional bus shelter. The publication's society columnist 
Anne Crawford doubles as its event organizer. Davidow sees events, such as its 
four-year anniversary bash at the Pacific Design Center next month, not only as 
a vehicle for raising the magazine's profile, but -- by drawing on a guest list 
of influential people -- as a potent form of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate its June issue, dedicated to a history of photography, L.A. Style 
co-hosted -- and in this case, co-hosted also meant paying the bills -- a 
cocktail party at the G. Ray Hawkins photography gallery last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Profile Guests 
</P>
<P>
Of the 175 or so guests who were invited, 150 came from L.A. Style's list of 
high-profile, art-scene types, including chic photographers and, of course, 
press. Among those at the party were Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, model Twinka 
Thiebaud, photographers Robert Heinecken and Eileen Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their party at my gallery, and they're allowing us to invite a few 
people," says Hawkins, who will exhibit photography highlighted in the issue. 
The photographs will come from several galleries, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
How does Hawkins benefit? "The reward is a combination of goodwill and P.R., 
and there will be some very nice things for sale. And of course we work on a 
commission for anything that sells," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
The venue may get a good party and a golden opportunity for publicity out of 
the arrangement. For fashion publications such as Elle and Glamour, which 
produce elaborately staged fashion shows, the events "bring alive the pages of 
the magazine" for a magazine's readers, as Elle's retail director, Barbara 
Szpak, puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Elle invites local subscribers to its events. L.A. Style does not. Magazines 
are also divided on the issue of passing out free copies at sponsored events. 
At the MOCA show, Elle passed out gift bags containing a current issue of the 
magazine, but GQ's marketing services director, Martha McCully, says it doesn't 
pass out magazines since most of its guests are subscribers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily, magazines use such events to solidify their relationships with 
advertisers. "The buzz word in magazines is added value," says Jack Kliger, 
publisher of Glamour. "It's not enough to run a page (of advertising), it's 
what do we do for (their) business," he says of advertisers' new requests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Departments 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, large publications are now doing quite a lot for their 
advertisers' dollars. Elle staffs a 10-person retail department in its New York 
business office (as opposed to editorial office) to stage fashion shows in 
department stores around the country, while Glamour staffs a seven-person 
special events department. 
</P>
<P>
Each magazine typically dispatches two or more staff members across the country 
to coordinate shows in order to exert control over events carrying its 
imprimatur. The department stores generally pay the costs of producing events, 
such as models' fees, food and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Night for Music Center 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone here to think this is a free dinner," host David Murdock 
said to the formally clad guests gathered in his palatial Bel-Air home, 
Bellagio House, for the "Island of Lanai Preview Dinner" Thursday in honor of 
the 25th anniversary of the Music Center. "You're all here for ulterior 
motives." 
</P>
<P>
The motive was selling the final vacancies for 20 couples (there are 50 in all) 
who will be Murdock's guests at a weekend marking the opening of his Lanai 
resort hideaway in Hawaii next February. A $25,000 donation to the Music Center 
buys a spot.

Vital Principles: The Molecular Mechanisms of Life by Andrew Scott (Basil 
Blackwell: $19.95; 256 pages) 
</P>
<P>
One of the central unanswered questions of modern biology is whether chemistry 
is all there is to life. Is biology just a branch of chemistry, and is 
chemistry just a branch of physics? 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, we are nowhere near having a complete chemical explanation for all 
living things, but in the end, is that what it will turn out to be? 
</P>
<P>
Few people are altogether comfortable with that idea, but all we know strongly 
implies that we are just flesh and blood. Complex chemistry, to be sure, but 
chemistry nonetheless. This is called the reductionist position. Life is "just" 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
If you think that's wrong, you have to explain what else there is in your head 
that gives rise to thoughts, feelings, sensations and such. If there is a soul, 
where is it? 
</P>
<P>
As you read these words, perhaps hearing them in your mind, the little voice 
that's "speaking" them is nothing but a complex set of electrochemical changes 
in your brain. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like that idea, come up with a better one. The field is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for Answers 
</P>
<P>
Max Delbruck , who half a century ago taught biologists that they should be 
interested in biochemistry, believed that there would be special laws of 
physics that would be applicable to living things. He never found any. 
</P>
<P>
Some biologists offer an alternative to reductionism without invoking spiritual 
or supernatural phenomena. They believe that while chemistry can explain a lot 
of life, it can't explain all of it. They suggest that there are "emergent" 
principles that arise in unpredictable ways in the course of the predictable 
chemistry of life. 
</P>
<P>
This is a guess. Much remains unknown, and everyone is free to think that it 
will follow rules that are known or rules that are so-far unknown. At the 
moment, it's a matter of choice, a matter of faith. 
</P>
<P>
But all of the evidence in hand argues in favor of reductionism, like it or 
not. As Andrew Scott puts it in "Vital Principles," a book that makes the case 
for reductionism, "All living things are simply the end result of the physics 
and chemistry within them. . . . As far as we know life simply is chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Principles 
</P>
<P>
Scott works from the bottom up, first explaining the basic principles of 
chemistry and physics, then showing how chemical reactions occur, then showing 
how they occur in living things. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
"DNA makes RNA, which makes protein, which makes cells, including their DNA and 
RNA and protein: that is the central principle of life." 
</P>
<P>
All of the processes of life occur "mindlessly," he says. All of the chemical 
regulation, the production of proteins, reproduction, all of it is the 
inevitable result of the laws of chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
This discussion takes up the first three-fourths of the book, and, truth to 
tell, it's rough going at times, despite Scott's repeated assertions that he's 
leaving out the details. Feel free to skim those parts where he's put in too 
many of them. 
</P>
<P>
The really interesting part comes in the last quarter of the book, where Scott 
turns to the higher brain functions in humans. Right off, he concedes that our 
knowledge is sketchy at best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mere' Chemistry 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is no evidence that there is anything at work in our brains 
besides "mere" chemistry. But how chemistry gives rise to consciousness is 
still a great mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, our minds are created by our brains and by our brains 
alone," Scott writes. "And the significant thing that happens in our brains is 
the transmission of nerve impulses. . . . All this 'nervous activity' is 
created and controlled by the activities of proteins and their specific 
interactions with the other chemicals of life; and, of course, the proteins are 
encoded by the genetic information in our genes. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, that is all that our enquiring minds have been able to discover 
about these minds, and it may be all there is to discover." 
</P>
<P>
If you share the central dogma of biology -- as I do -- you have faith that 
someday, probably not in our lifetimes, science will have a complete 
explanation of the chemistry of the brain. We will then be able to match every 
thought, every shading and nuance of emotion, every memory, with a specific 
chemical state. For the moment, however -- and the moment may last a very long 
time -- that is an article of faith. 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly," Scott says, "the deepest mysteries concern the questions we would most 
like to be able to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all living minds, and yet science cannot tell us exactly what a mind 
is, or what a thought, an idea or a sensation in our brain is. It can offer no 
really satisfactory answer to the puzzle of how inanimate matter composed of 
atoms and molecules and ions can give rise to the consciousness which is able 
to identify and confront such puzzles."

STATE TEXTBOOK SELECTION LAWS COME UNDER ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TROMBLEY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
California's textbook adoption laws, considered by many to be a cornerstone of 
the state's recent curriculum reform efforts, have come under legislative 
attack from textbook publishers and other critics. 
</P>
<P>
So far, defenders of the present system, led by California Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig, seem to be winning the legislative battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat it back," Honig said confidently last week, referring to what Honig 
called an attempt by publishers and others "to basically do us in and cut the 
process way down." 
</P>
<P>
But others say the skirmishing continues and the final outcome is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers and other critics say the California process is lengthy, cumbersome, 
arbitrary and capricious and does not, in the end, produce better books and 
other instructional materials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a six-month process and then they go into their little box and tell you 
somebody's accepted and somebody's not but you never know why," said John B. 
Mockler, Sacramento lobbyist for the Assn. of American Publishers, the textbook 
publishers' trade association. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers group is supporting a bill by state Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) 
that would shorten the textbook adoption cycle from seven years to two, require 
the state Board of Education to give specific written reasons for rejecting 
text materials and change the composition of the state Curriculum Commission, 
among other features. 
</P>
<P>
In this form, the legislation is more or less acceptable to Honig and other 
state education officials, but as originally written it was not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Maddy bill would have required the state Board of Education to 
approve all instructional materials submitted by publishers within 90 days, if 
they met certain minimum standards. If materials were rejected, a special panel 
of experts would have had to provide a "detailed explanation of the reasons 
why." 
</P>
<P>
"This reversed the process and put the burden of proof on the board, not the 
publishers," said Dan Chernow, state Curriculum Commission chair. "It was an 
obvious attempt to dismantle the process." 
</P>
<P>
The original Maddy bill "sent shock waves through the educational community," 
said Charlotte Crabtree, professor of education at UCLA and co-author of the 
state's much-praised new social science-history framework. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling was that, nationally, educators were looking to California to lead 
the way . . . to continue the curricular reform movement and this bill would 
weaken our ability to do that," Chernow said. 
</P>
<P>
At the behest of Crabtree, Honig and others, nationally prominent educators 
wrote to Gov. George Deukmejian and to legislative leaders to protest the Maddy 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the bill, and similar legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Bob 
Epple (D-Norwalk), "would be to undermine one of the most promising education 
reform efforts anywhere in the land," Chester E. Finn Jr., professor of 
education and public policy at Vanderbilt University and a key aide to former 
U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett, wrote in a typical letter. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with this barrage of criticism from the education community, Maddy and 
the bill's supporters began to negotiate a less drastic measure with Honig and 
other officials of the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
California is only one of 22 states with statewide adoption policies but 
accounts for about 10% of national textbook sales, so materials selected in 
California often influence the national market. 
</P>
<P>
The state Constitution requires adoption of instructional materials for grades 
one through eight. Local school districts must use the state-approved list for 
80% of their textbook purchases if they want to be reimbursed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong process that leads to state adoption begins with scrutiny of new 
textbooks by Instructional Materials Evaluation Panels, made up of classroom 
teachers, "master teachers," curriculum specialists, and college and university 
professors. These panels make recommendations to the Curriculum Commission, 
which then proposes a list of five to 15 texts in each subject area, and for 
each grade, to the state Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dumbing Down' 
</P>
<P>
Many educators believe that textbook quality declined in the 1960s and 1970s, 
as publishers deliberately engaged in a "dumbing down" process that was 
supposed to make the books more readily understandable to the increasing number 
of poorly prepared pupils who were entering the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
When Honig was first elected state superintendent in 1982, he pledged to set 
tougher standards and to improve the curriculum, including better textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
At his urging, the Curriculum Commission and the state school board have 
insisted that biology texts do a better job of explaining evolution and human 
reproduction, that mathematics books relate the teaching of math skills to 
real-life situations and that reading materials stress literature as well as 
phonics and other basic elements of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
In this process, many textbooks have been rejected and others have had to be 
substantially revised, much to the annoyance of the publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Open Court, a Chicago publisher, was especially outraged when both its reading 
and mathematics books were rejected in California and the president of the 
company, Andre Carus, "vowed then that they were going to put forward a bill to 
change the process," said Glen Thomas, who directs the state Department of 
Education's textbook evaluation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
To the publishers, this seemed an especially good time to try to change the 
California laws because in 1990 the state will adopt new social science and 
history textbooks, based on a startling new "framework" written by Crabtree and 
by Diane Ravitch, adjunct professor of history and education at Teachers 
College, Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
No current history text is thought to be in tune with the new framework, which 
Ravitch has characterized as requiring "vivid narrative accounts of American 
history and world history," treatment of "major events in depth" and 
"well-written biographies" of historical figures. 
</P>
<P>
"It was simpler for the publishers to lobby to revise the process than it was 
to provide better books," Crabtree said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Washington education writer Harriet Tyson published a 1988 
book that was sharply critical of "America's textbook fiasco" and of the 
statewide adoption processes that Tyson believes encourage publishers to 
produce bland books. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview last week, Tyson accused Honig of grandstanding in his 
denunciations of textbook publishers and their products and said California "is 
not leading us all into the sunlight" of better instructional materials. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, publishers are reluctant to produce new books for California, Tyson 
added, because of "feelings that the product may not be chosen for reasons of 
merit" but for "political reasons" or "because of deals of one kind or 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's book was published by the Council for Basic Education, a 
Washington-based organization that has been instrumental in the national 
curriculum reform movement of recent years. The council, which usually does not 
engage in direct political activity, then decided to lobby for legislation that 
would change the California adoption process. 
</P>
<P>
The council hired Sacramento lobbyist Jack C. Crose, who arranged for a meeting 
between Tyson and Maddy -- and the legislation was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I had thought earlier this would be a good way to get quality textbooks in 
California," said A. Graham Down, executive director of the Council for Basic 
Education. "Now I think it probably was an error to get involved there." 
</P>
<P>
The council was blasted by those educators who believe that the California 
adoption process is one of the few bright spots in a generally bleak textbook 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"The council certainly picked the wrong state at the wrong time," wrote Gilbert 
T. Sewell, director of the American Textbook Council, in a typical comment. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with this kind of criticism and a split among its trustees (who had not 
approved the lobbying effort in the first place), the Council for Basic 
Education withdrew support of Maddy's bill, leaving the textbook publishers, 
represented by John Mockler, as its leading backers. 
</P>
<P>
This is probably why Maddy decided to remove the most controversial part of the 
bill -- requiring the state Board of Education to prove that submitted 
materials were not good, instead of requiring the publishers to prove that they 
were -- although it is hard to be sure because Maddy did not return several 
telephone calls seeking his views. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Maddy bill and the Epple bill still contain several important 
features, including: 
</P>
<P>
* A "rolling adoption" process that would allow publishers to submit new 
materials every other year, instead of every seven years, as is the current 
practice. However, Francie Alexander, the associate superintendent of education 
who supervises textbook adoption, said only books that are "really new and 
different" would be considered between major adoptions, which would still take 
place every seven years. 
</P>
<P>
* If materials are rejected, the state school board must provide a "written 
explanation of the reasons why." 
</P>
<P>
* The books should be factually accurate and should use "teaching strategies 
generally recognized as effective. . . ." Alexander said the state school board 
and the Curriculum Commission have been using these criteria but they have not 
previously been written into the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
* At least seven of the 13 public members on the 18-member Curriculum 
Commission should be full-time classroom teachers for grades one through eight 
and all of the commission's subcommittees also should have a majority of 
full-time classroom teachers. 
</P>
<P>
This issue is of concern to teacher organizations more than textbook 
publishers. "The individual classroom teacher is the most qualified person to 
select instructional materials which meet the diverse needs of the learner," 
said Len Feldman, communications consultant for the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas, of the state Department of Education, said it is difficult for a 
full-time elementary school teacher, who usually must teach several subjects, 
to develop enough expertise in any one subject to be a good judge of textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
As amended, the Maddy and Epple bills have been approved by the education 
committees of both the state Senate and the Assembly. Maddy and Mockler, 
representing the publishers, are still discussing the language in the Senate 
measure with state education officials, but it is possible that Maddy's bill 
may reach the Senate floor in the next two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
No one can be sure until the process is over, but it appears that the 
publishers and other critics are expected to get only minor changes in the 
California textbook adoption process. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the proposed changes would "open up the process a little bit" 
and give the local school districts more choice of materials, said Donald A. 
Eklund, vice president of the school division of the Assn. of American 
Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
But the drastic changes that were contained in earlier versions of the 
legislation have disappeared.

<TEXT>
<P>
At 15, Robert LeBlanc didn't know exactly what he wanted to be when he grew up, 
but like many youngsters his age, he figured he would be something special. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he would be a musician, he thought. He liked the piano and organ, and he 
practiced them both diligently. Friends, relatives and instructors who admired 
his drawing skills thought he might become a commercial artist, a draftsman or 
even an architect. 
</P>
<P>
What LeBlanc never guessed was that two years later he would drop out of high 
school. Nor did he suspect that shortly after he left school he would spend 25 
months behind bars for burglary and trespassing. But most of all, LeBlanc never 
imagined that when he reached manhood at 21, he would be lucky just to get a 
job as a sacker at a New Orleans area supermarket at $3.75 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I'm a nobody -- that's what everybody 
thinks, anyway," LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, government officials, business leaders and sociologists say, 
millions upon millions of high school dropouts stand just where LeBlanc is now, 
struggling for a toehold in a changing society while the room for them grows 
smaller and smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs are personal stories of bleak prospects. Like LeBlanc, government 
studies show, these dropouts will shuffle between low-paying jobs and 
unemployment. They will be twice as likely as graduates to end up behind bars. 
For female dropouts -- mostly unwed mothers -- welfare dependency awaits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nation's Future 
</P>
<P>
But sociologists, academicians and business leaders warn that the story of 
Robert LeBlanc and his peers is far more than individual tragedy. Their future 
is the nation's future, they say. 
</P>
<P>
As its dropout rate continues to hover at 30%, the United States is reaping a 
labor pool in which nearly half of its new work force is educationally 
deficient. At the same time, a changing economy is putting a premium on 
reading, math and thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, business leaders are hard pressed to find workers, and American 
business is spending $30 billion a year training employees in reading and math 
skills that they should have received in high school. 
</P>
<P>
There are monetary costs to society as well. Experts estimate that the dropouts 
in each year's class represent both an increasing welfare burden and, over 
their lifetimes, $240 billion in lost tax revenues. Meanwhile, prison 
incarcerations have shot up dramatically, nearly doubling in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
If the problem of high school dropouts and a faltering educational system is 
not met head on, it is not just individuals but the entire nation that is at 
risk, said David P. Gardner, president of the University of California system 
and head of a blue-ribbon panel studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The task must be faced and the price must be paid," Gardner said. "We are out 
of alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Robert LeBlanc's troubles and the dilemma he presents for New Orleans and 
Louisiana represent a drama being played out across America. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc left high school in the 12th grade with a spotty academic record. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped out because I was doing terrible in school," he said. "I was 
sleeping in class. I used to hardly ever study." 
</P>
<P>
His biggest problem was reading -- the school system never succeeded in 
teaching him to master it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand what I'm reading," he said. "I don't remember it. Just to 
get my driver's license I had to read the book about 15 times." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he failed English five years in a row, and three times he went to 
summer school to make up credit. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left school, LeBlanc also got into trouble with the law. When he was 
17, a girl he knew let him into her uncle's house and suggested that he take 
$170 in cash and give her a share later. He was caught two days later and 
charged with burglary. Already doing poorly in school and now facing a trial 
with the possibility of spending two years in prison, he decided that trying to 
go on was pointless. 
</P>
<P>
Like dropouts across the country, LeBlanc waded into the work force with few 
skills. He was already working at a fast-food restaurant as a short order cook 
for minimum wage, but shortly after he left school the job disappeared when the 
company was sold. He landed a job at McDonald's but, after a week, he quit. He 
had made only $8 in his first week because of short hours, he said, and the 
manager couldn't promise much more. 
</P>
<P>
In court, LeBlanc got some good news. He was given three years probation. But 
as he applied for job after job, he discovered that almost nobody wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, business and government leaders say that as the nation moves 
toward a more technical society, there is little room for high school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem now is that we have a greater need for graduates than we ever had 
before," said Sally Hayes, head of the education committee for the New Orleans 
Chamber of Commerce. "In order to be able to function competitively, they have 
to be able to think, they have to be able to problem solve. This is a different 
set of skills." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis-based think tank 
specializing in public policy issues, forecast that by the 1990s, more than 
half of all new jobs will require some education beyond high school. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders are already complaining that today even those who are 
graduated from high school are deficient in the skills needed in the new 
economy. High school dropouts, they say, are so far off the mark as to drop 
almost totally from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
One example of just how far off the mark those graduates are is the National 
Education Assessment Test given last year to 21- to 25-year-olds. A score of 
300 on the literacy portion indicates an ability to follow directions to travel 
from one location to another. Seventy-eight percent of dropouts failed. A score 
of 300 on the math portion indicates the ability to enter deposits and checks 
and balance a checkbook. Seventy-nine percent of dropouts failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for these kids," said Karen Evans, acting supervisor at the West 
Bank Training Center, a federally funded job training operation just outside of 
New Orleans. "They come in reading at the fifth- and sixth-grade level and 
they're competing with adults who are out of work. And there aren't enough 
blue-collar jobs that pay $7, $8, $10 an hour. They just don't exist. They're 
looking at jobs that pay minimum wage, and sometimes they are part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of time, our time is spent in 'reality therapy.' They say: 'I want a job 
making $5 an hour.' Kids tell us: 'Nobody can live on $3.35 an hour.' Our 
response is: 'Take a look: this is what the real world is like.' We say: 'What 
can you do that somebody is going to pay you more than $3.35 an hour for?' 
</P>
<P>
"At first, they're shocked. They look at us like 'what are you talking about?' 
The kids come in and think that -- they've worked on their cars at home -- they 
can get a job as a mechanic. They discover that even to do minor tuneups, you 
have to be able to read a computer printout. It takes more literacy. Nobody is 
going to let you work on their $15,000 car if you haven't had some experience 
and training." 
</P>
<P>
Before many of those dropouts get to Evans, they have been to the office of 
Regina Roat, employment manager for Hyatt Regency in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy percent of the people who come through this office haven't graduated 
from high school," said Roat, whose office hires hourly employees -- the 
reservation clerks, PBX operators, housekeepers, stewards, cooks, waiters, 
waitresses, and cashiers who make up 90% of the hotel's staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating. I have people come in and fill out a job application and 
they have someone with them to help them fill it out. I spend a lot of time 
when I'm interviewing just filling in the blanks. I expect that, to a degree, 
because these are low-paying, hourly jobs, but not to the severity that it is 
here. I can't hire someone who can't speak and who can't read and write, and I 
get a lot of those." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Applications 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Roat said she finds herself wading through a stack of applicants 
to fill one simple job. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably interview at least 30 people for one desk position, probably 15 for 
a housekeeper. I had a lady who came in who was perfect for a waitress position 
in our deli. She was bubbly, she was clean. She had to be able to read to take 
orders and ring things up. She told me she couldn't work in the deli because 
she couldn't read and write." 
</P>
<P>
Other New Orleans companies report similar situations. Chevron, for instance, 
is looking for operations and maintenance personnel at its New Orleans 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them have a hard time passing the basic reading, writing and 
arithmetic test," said Chris Lardge, manager of employment in Chevron's San 
Francisco headquarters. "They have a lot of people lined up per job, but they 
whittle them down quickly because a lot of them can't read instructions clearly 
and understand what they're reading, and write things, and they have some 
problems with basic mathematics. It's true across the country, in our Richmond 
refinery, our Philadelphia refinery. I was down in Pascagoula, Miss., and they 
were saying the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
New York Telephone Co. reports that in a six-month period in 1987, 84% of its 
job applicants failed the entry-level examination. Only 20% of job applicants 
at Motorola could pass a simple seventh-grade test of English comprehension or 
fifth-grade mathematics test. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from skills, dropouts present "an attitudinal problem," said Hugh 
Farrabaugh, human resources director for Martin Marietta in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"They lack the discipline and commitment to operate within a structure," he 
said. "They have difficulty assimilating into an industrial structural 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
And as industry moves toward high technology, even workers now on the job seem 
to lack the educational skills to handle more automated tasks. What many 
companies are finding is what Motorola Inc. Vice President Carlton Braun told 
the congressional Joint Economic Committee last April. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found to our disappointment that many workers are not prepared to 
operate the factory of the present, much less of the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Martin Marietta, makers of booster rockets for the space shuttle, officials 
are wrestling with how to move a work force toward more advanced technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intent is to get more automated," Farrabaugh said. "As we become more 
automated and upgrade our capability . . . we may have to get training in 
computer literacy. Technical vocabulary is a problem. Computation skills are 
not what we like them to be. Presently, the company is trying to figure out at 
what grade level should it write new training and instruction material. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to write the documents to an acceptable level, but not to a 
third-grade level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert LeBlanc eventually landed a job at a Burger King. That lasted three 
days. He was arrested atop a building near his home one night after work and 
charged with burglary. Already on probation, he spent six months in jail before 
pleading guilty to a reduced charge of criminal trespassing -- a misdemeanor. 
After his release, he found a job as a busboy at a local country club. But, on 
the day before he got his first paycheck, his probation on the original 
burglary charge was revoked because of the misdemeanor conviction. He was sent 
to Jefferson Parish Prison for 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
There he found lots of people like himself. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we're seeing, they drop out of school and end up in juvenile 
institutions and in prison," said Martha Jumonville, communications director 
for the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. "Many of them 
don't have the ability to read or write above the fifth-grade level, can't fill 
out a job application." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 62% of the nation's prison 
inmates in 1986 were high school dropouts. That was up from 53% just seven 
years earlier. The median education level has declined from 11 years of 
schooling in 1979 to 10 years in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incarcerations Up 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, incarcerations have shot up. In California, for example, in 1980, 
103 people out of every 100,000 were behind bars. Last year, the figure had 
more than doubled to 239 out of 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Prison was a rude awakening for LeBlanc.

"I don't want to go back there," he said. "That's why I need to get a job to 
keep my mind on work." In prison, he found, "You don't do nothing, you don't 
see nothing, you don't go nowhere. It's just nothing. They feed you cold food. 
They treat you like dogs. I got into a lot of fights. You have to fight to 
survive. I thought I'd never get out." 
</P>
<P>
When most inmates finally make it out, they end up back on the streets with the 
same educational inadequacies. It is little surprise to prison officials that 
they soon return to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"If, by reason of not having the ability or having a skill and education, an 
inmate cannot go out and sell himself, then he can't find a job -- that is, a 
non-skilled, non-reading job," said Tony Travisano, executive director of 
American Correctional Assn., the professional organization that represents 
various correctional groups around the United States. In that case, Travisano 
said, he is likely to return to crime -- "He's going to get his bread from some 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 63% of prison inmates are back behind bars within six months after 
release. In an attempt to deal with that problem in Louisiana, state 
legislation has been introduced that would require inmates to be able to read 
and write before becoming eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do get out, what are you going to do if you don't have the skills to 
get a job?" Jumonville asked. "You need to have something to keep you from 
going back to the crime that you committed. If you can't read, can't write, 
chances are you're going to wind up back in prison." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans Judge Miriam Waltzer has watched them trudge through her courtroom. 
A year ago, she said: "I just got sick and tired of seeing people who can't 
read." So she instituted a program of sentencing people to earn their high 
school graduation equivalency degree. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week her courtroom is turned into a classroom. The rule is simple: show 
up for class or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"They would plead guilty and there is a form they have to fill out," Waltzer 
said. "I'd ask them to read the first paragraph of a form they have to fill out 
and they would say I forgot my glasses. I'd ask them what 'waive your rights' 
means and they would say waive would mean wave your hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to me how many were out there who were not able to read anything, not 
even the instructions on a box. I think if we're successful with what we're 
trying to do, that we save the state a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc got his general equivalency degree while in prison. After his release, 
he headed for the West Bank Training Center and, with the help of a job 
placement agency, landed a job at minimum wage, 25 miles from his home. That 
lasted one day. Without a car or transportation, he says, he couldn't get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
For the three weeks after that, he looked for jobs sporadically, sometimes 
staying at his mother's home, sometimes at his father's house, and occasionally 
spending the night with a cousin who owns a local lounge. During the day, he 
idled away his time. 
</P>
<P>
One day recently, LeBlanc sat at his mother's kitchen table bemoaning his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit around. I straighten up around the house for a while. I go talk to my 
father. I go talk to my grandma or just hang around with one of my brothers. 
Shoot pool on Wednesday nights and sometimes I go to my cousin's lounge. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like every step I take I run into a locked door. Now my girlfriend is 
starting to talk trash -- her daddy says she shouldn't be with me because I'm a 
nobody, because I don't have a job. I'm in a mood like I don't want to do 
nothing no more. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people, they don't want nobody like me. They want a dependable 
person with a car, somebody they can call any time of the day. I've got a 
record, you know. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to find a job and stay with it and learn things about it. I just 
want to stay with something and work my way up to be a somebody. I don't want 
to be a nobody." 
</P>
<P>
The very next day, LeBlanc landed his part-time job as a sacker at a local 
grocery store. But there is a hitch. Because of his prison record, he can't 
start work until he produces a letter from the court that says there are no 
other pending charges against him. In the interim, a family friend has hired 
him at $25 a day to clean up and help out around his tuxedo shop. 
</P>
<P>
For now, LeBlanc is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"He's happy," his mother, Lynn James, said. "He's got a little money and he 
fixed his brother's car and he's got that." 
</P>
<P>
Still it's a long way from being a musician or a draftsman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just hoping that working and getting in a job situation and making money 
he'll think about doing something more with his life," his mother said.

SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY'S SMOG THREATENS SIERRA AND AGRICULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HANFORD, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time, Simon Lakritz recalls, when he could see the snowcapped peaks 
of the Sierra Nevada from his San Joaquin Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, Lakritz, who has lived in the valley for 30 years, 
watched the horizon dissolve into a haze as smog obscured his vista. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be you could see the Sierra from my front yard," Lakritz said. Now, 
although mountains are just an hour's drive away, "it's only once in a blue 
moon, when the wind is blowing just right, that you can see them." 
</P>
<P>
Like Lakritz, many San Joaquin Valley residents and air quality officials are 
becoming increasingly aware of the region's air quality. Encircled by mountains 
and capped by a recurring layer of warm air that traps emissions, the valley is 
a natural smog caldron. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the valley's population has grown by 450,000 people, and more 
people mean more cars, trucks, barbecues and fireplaces spewing pollutants into 
the air to be cooked by the summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
Air pollution, especially ozone, has begun to threaten the valley's $8-billion 
agricultural harvest. Ozone rarely kills plants, but it can cause them to lose 
leaves and buds sooner than normal. According to state estimates, smog caused 
more than $150 million in reduced crop yields last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Worst . . . Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential of becoming the worst air pollution problem in the U.S., 
even worse than they have down in L.A.," said Judy Andreen, Fresno County 
representative on the Basinwide Air Pollution Control Council, a panel 
representing eight San Joaquin Valley counties. 
</P>
<P>
Valley smog also contributes to acid rain and fog, which forestry officials 
fear may one day lead to the destruction of forests and lakes in the southern 
Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any dead lakes or forests yet, but they are the most sensitive 
forests in the nation," said Dr. John R. Holmes, a researcher with the state 
Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
Smog also threatens the region's economic health in another way. In order to 
comply with the California Clean Air Act passed last November, air pollution 
officials in the valley must reduce emissions from factory smokestacks and 
other stationary sources by 15% -- and develop plans for complying with federal 
smog limits -- by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials may also have to impose regulations that would impede economic 
growth and they have begun to consider air quality when approving land use 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno County, for example, is weighing whether to restrict developments that 
encourage longer commutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always some potential for limiting of residential, commercial and 
industrial growth. . . . We have to look at everything in order attain those 
(clean air) goals," said Robert C. Dowell, Fresno county air pollution control 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
In Stanislaus County, officials are considering a fee on commercial and 
residential developers for cleaning up auto exhaust generated by motorists who 
use their shopping malls and housing tracts. Such fees are now imposed only on 
industrial sources of pollution, said Mark Boese, deputy air pollution control 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
In Kings and Kern counties, companies that employ large numbers of people or 
require frequent deliveries may have to pay for air cleanup or minimize their 
emissions through car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
"The evaluation of air quality requires that we look at how we design 
communities. It's not just a matter of how we regulate tailpipe and smokestack 
emissions," said Bill Sessa, state Air Resources Board spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Smog levels in the valley had stabilized with tougher requirements for 
anti-smog devices on new cars and stricter regulation of industry in the last 
decade, Sessa said, but over the last three years, the added pollution from 
growth appears to have canceled out those gains. Ozone levels in the valley 
appear to be on the rise, having exceeded federal standards on 59 days in 1986 
and 64 days in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The state Air Resources Board counts 2.5 million people living in the valley 
from Lodi in the north to Bakersfield in the south. Since 1980, the population 
has grown by 22%, and the state predicts that it will grow 40% more by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the growth in the northern part of the valley has come from Bay Area 
residents looking for affordable housing. The cities of Stockton, Manteca, 
Tracy and Modesto are rapidly becoming Bay Area suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 12,000 people who moved to San Joaquin County last year commute to 
jobs in the Bay Area, said Lakhmir Grewal, director of the county air pollution 
control district. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area may also be contributing directly to the valley's growing air 
pollution problems. Studies have shown that smog from the Bay Area drifts 
through the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta or creeps over the Altamont Pass where 
Interstate 580 connects with the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area smog officials concede that some of their impure air ends up in the 
valley, but they dispute its effects. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone would agree the Bay Area contributes to (smog) exceedances in 
the Central Valley. But the question is how much," said Robin DeMandel, a 
spokesman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
But the valley is not without its own industrial pollution. The southern San 
Joaquin Valley accounts for 64% of the state's total oil production. In 1987, 
Kern County alone produced more than 250 million barrels from its 78 oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
"If Kern County were a country, we would be the 16th largest oil producer in 
the world," said Ed Welge, Kern County deputy for the state's Division of Oil 
and Gas. 
</P>
<P>
San Joaquin Valley oil, often referred to in the trade as "sour crude," is 
heavier and more viscous than oil from other regions. Because of its high 
viscosity, steam generators are needed to loosen and pump the molasses-like oil 
to the surface. The steam generators dump a significant amount of exhaust into 
the valley air. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the way air pollution is regulated in the valley contributes 
to the problem. Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area have 
regional air pollution control districts, but the valley's air quality is 
regulated by eight independent agencies, one per county. 
</P>
<P>
Smog is not confined by county boundaries, so any solution will require a 
regional approach, the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
"We can continue to meet guidelines and still choke to death," said Ken 
Bettencourt, a member of the Kings County Citizens for a Healthy Environment. 
</P>
<P>
The main group working to improve regional cooperation, the basin control 
council, meets monthly, with one elected supervisor serving from each county. 
The group is only advisory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone Goes Home' 
</P>
<P>
"We go, we meet and everyone goes home," said Les Brown, the group's chairman 
and a Kings County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the counties have agreed to produce the San Joaquin Valley Air 
Quality Study, a $9-million project initiated last year by a regional joint 
powers agency. Scheduled to be completed some time over the next decade, the 
study will measure the effect of various sources of smog and consider new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Bettencourt and others say the lack of regional control has led to the 
proliferation of another source of pollution: the small energy-producing plants 
known as cogenerators. 
</P>
<P>
Cogeneration plants generate electricity along with heat or steam by burning a 
variety of fuels, including natural gas, garbage, wood and coal. Cogenerators 
supply canneries, garbage incinerators, factories and other businesses with 
heat or steam and use the rest of the steam to produce electricity. 
</P>
<P>
There are 49 cogeneration facilities in California today, contrasted with only 
one in 1980. Another 116 projects are expected to be operating by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all the industrial development in the San Joaquin Valley, this is the 
biggest segment and consequently the most controversial," said Sessa, from the 
state Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
Growing concern over smog in the valley has prompted many communities to oppose 
such projects. In Hanford, Kingsburg and Selma, proposed coal-burning 
cogeneration plants have touched off bitter battles between the communities and 
GWF Power Systems, the company behind the projects. 
</P>
<P>
In Hanford, the dispute has led to the ousting of the mayor and two City 
Council members who approved the project. Attempting to ban the burning of coal 
within the city limits, the newly elected council is now tangled in a lawsuit 
with GWF. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has arisen despite assurances from the industry -- which has 
contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the official air pollution 
study -- that cogeneration is cleaner than many other industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Since there is seldom any desire to do anything to existing sources of 
pollution, the tendency is to deal with the new sources coming in. Cogeneration 
is always the new guy on the block," said Jan Hamrin, executive director of the 
Independent Power Producers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The growing concern over air pollution has also led to a new alliance between 
environmentalists and farmers. Farmers were often regarded as part of the 
problem because of agricultural burning, dust from plowing and smog device 
exemptions for farming equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But farmers are becoming increasingly aware of the effect of air pollution on 
their livelihoods, said Jim Verboon, Kings County Farm Bureau president. 
Verboon estimates that crop yields for cotton, grapes and citrus are reduced by 
15% to 20% because of ozone pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought environmentalists in the past. But now we stand to suffer the most 
(from air pollution)," Verboon said. "In my opinion we'll be the 
environmentalists of the future."

Israeli troops and militiamen of the South Lebanon Army on Sunday killed two 
Palestinian guerrillas and captured two others in a shoot-out in southern 
Lebanon, an army spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol spotted four guerrillas before dawn inside Israel's self-proclaimed 
security zone near the village of Marjayoun, a few miles north of the Israeli 
border, and opened fire. There were no reported casualties among the Israeli or 
Lebanese troops. 
</P>
<P>
"A preliminary investigation established that the terrorists intended to carry 
out an attack on a northern settlement to kill Israelis," the army spokesman 
said, adding that the guerrillas carried Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault 
rifles, a grenade launcher, two American-made anti-tank rockets, wire cutters 
and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iran-Made Explosives Reported 
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said the guerrillas who were killed carried white plastic bags 
filled with plastic explosives made in Iran and wore red headbands. On the 
headbands were written Allahu Akbar (Arabic for God is great) as well as 
slogans in Persian. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army spokesman said the military is investigating the report. 
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement released in Beirut that 
a guerrilla squad consisting of rebels from the PFLP and the Palestine 
Liberation Front had slipped into northern Israel early Sunday and engaged in 
fierce clashes with Israeli troops. 
</P>
<P>
However, security sources said the guerrillas who were ambushed by the soldiers 
near Marjayoun were believed to be the same group the PFLP mentioned as having 
crossed the border. 
</P>
<P>
During the ambush, guerrillas fired several Soviet-made Katyusha rockets into 
the northern Israeli settlement of Metulla, the first such attack in a year. 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman confirmed the shelling and said an 8-month-old baby 
was slightly wounded by flying glass after one of the rockets exploded outside 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
The PFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front both claimed responsibility for the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the hand of a 26-year-old Jewish settler in the village 
of Brakh in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was blown off when he picked up a 
booby-trapped Israeli flag on which a Nazi swastika was painted, state-run 
Israeli Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded 16 Palestinians in 
clashes with stone-throwing youths in four refugee camps and in Gaza City, Arab 
reports said. The army confirmed two wounded and said it was checking the other 
reports.

MESSAGE TO REBELLIOUS ARABS: 'IT'S TIT FOR TAT'; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAELI SETTLERS WAGING 'ANTIFADA' 
</P>

<P>
KIRYAT ARBA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weapons -- rocks and gasoline bombs -- are familiar, although these crude 
arms are often supplemented by submachine guns, rifles and pistols. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the message of the violence is also the same: "We are here. This 
land is ours. Drive on the highways at your own risk." 
</P>
<P>
But these are not rebellious Palestinians trying to throw off Israeli rule. 
They are Israeli settlers trying to draw attention -- and military 
reinforcements -- to their homes in hostile territory. 
</P>
<P>
More and more incidents of settler vigilantism are occurring in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israelis have begun to refer to an "antifada," a 
response to the Arab intifada, the uprising that is making the settlers 
increasingly nervous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Strike Back' 
</P>
<P>
"We react," said David Ramati, a former U.S. Marine who emigrated 22 years ago 
and settled in this hilltop enclave in the West Bank town of Hebron. "If 
someone throws a stone at us, we strike back. It's tit for tat." 
</P>
<P>
Ramati has organized vigilante squads that patrol the streets outside the 
perimeter of the housing complex and occasionally raid the homes of suspected 
stone throwers in adjacent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not living in conquered territory," he told a reporter. "I'm at home and 
have the right to feel at home." 
</P>
<P>
Kiryat Arba is not the only place where settlers are striking at Arab 
communities. On Friday, there were at least three settler attacks on Arab 
villages. Settlers raided the West Bank villages of Deir es Sudan, Arura and 
Abwein, damaging water tanks, houses and cars with gunshot and stones. In 
Arura, settlers shot and wounded at least four teen-agers, according to Israel 
Radio. A third resident was wounded in the face by rubber bullets in a clash 
with Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, settlers rampaged through the village of Eizariya for the 
second night in a row in response to a serious stone-throwing attack. A driver 
from the nearby settlement of Maaleh Adumim lost control of his car and 
crashed; his wife and children were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Settlers from Ariel in the central West Bank have raided numerous villages 
along the road from Ariel to the coast in retaliation for rock attacks. They 
have smashed windows in Arab houses and hurled stones at Arab-owned cars. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, a Palestinian was killed when he was hit in the head with a rock 
while driving back to Hebron from his job in Israel. The incident occurred 
inside Israel, where stone-throwing attacks began after the body of an abducted 
soldier was found in a remote grave near the town of Ashkelon. 
</P>
<P>
Last month in Hebron, a settler shot and killed a 13-year-old boy he said was 
throwing stones at his car. The gunman was released after questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are expressing concern at the aggressiveness of the settlers. 
Last Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, told a 
parliamentary committee that attacks by settlers on Arabs are "a dangerous 
innovation." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Yosef Harish warned settlers that "this phenomenon will be 
uprooted." 
</P>
<P>
"Civilians," he said, "will not be allowed to take the law into their own 
hands, whether under the pretext of a military action instead of the Israel 
Defense Forces or in addition to the actions taken by the military." 
</P>
<P>
In an article Friday in the newspaper Haaretz, military analyst Zeev Schiff 
said the Israeli army "is on the verge of losing control over inflamed settlers 
in the territories." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leftist Legislators Complain 
</P>
<P>
Two leftist members of Parliament say the attacks by Jewish settlers against 
Palestinians in the West Bank are the work of a "very efficient and well-armed" 
militia. The legislators sent a complaint to Atty. Gen. Harish last month after 
40 settlers stormed into a Palestinian mayor's office to protest rock attacks 
on Israeli cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on the attorney general to break up this militia," said Yossi 
Sarid, who drafted the complaint. "Today, we are already talking about a 
militia. They are well organized and we are seeing increased cooperation 
between settlers in different settlements. They say that as far as they are 
concerned, the army is not fulfilling its mission, and they have no choice but 
to fulfill the mission." 
</P>
<P>
Agitation among settlers has sharpened in recent weeks as the army has reduced 
its round-the-clock presence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, turning instead 
to hit-and-run roundups of Palestinian activists. Only the main roads of the 
occupied lands are patrolled consistently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomacy Discounted 
</P>
<P>
The settlers also view the diplomatic steps aimed at settling the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict as imperiling their stay on the land. 
</P>
<P>
"We would die rather than give up these homes," said Ramati, the patrol 
organizer in Kiryat Arba, the first settlement to employ them. 
</P>
<P>
Kiryat Arba is home to 7,000 settlers Ramati described as religious Zionists 
who stake their claim to the land on the basis of the Bible. Hebron, for 
instance, is the site of the tomb of the Prophet Abraham, a patriarch revered 
by Jews and Muslims alike. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the settlers patrol in cars and jeeps, often accompanying public 
buses. Sometimes they descend on neighborhoods in response to someone throwing 
stones or a gasoline bomb. When a fracas breaks out, the army often intervenes 
to separate Arab and Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
Ramati, 42, said that since his group began operating, the army has stepped up 
its patrols in Hebron -- to his pleasure, because it keeps rebellious Arabs 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some noise, and the army stopped ignoring us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Secretary of State James A. Baker III called on Israel to 
stop the settlement program. Washington, which wants Israel to give up occupied 
land in exchange for peace, considers the settlements an obstacle to peace. 
</P>
<P>
Ramati responded, with a defiance not uncommon in the settler communities, that 
U.S. pressure to halt the settlement process should be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "People have been saying this kind of thing for 2,000 years, that the 
Jews don't need a homeland, that they should get along somewhere else. Well, 
we're not listening."

EX-JAPANESE LEADER TO QUIT PARTY OVER SCANDAL 
</P>

Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone announced Sunday that he will give up 
his membership in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to assume responsibility 
for an influence-buying scandal that occurred while he was in office. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone, 71, also said he will resign as leader of the influential party 
faction that he has headed since 1966 and give up his membership in the party's 
council of elders. 
</P>
<P>
Motoharu Morishita, secretary general of Nakasone's faction, announced the 
decision after meeting the ex-prime minister at his home. 
</P>
<P>
The apology and Nakasone's action to remove himself from the front line of 
decision-making is widely seen to be aimed at removing a major obstacle 
standing in the way of the designation of Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, 66, to 
succeed outgoing Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, 65. Although himself 
untainted by the scandal, Uno is a lieutenant of Nakasone's faction. 
</P>
<P>
Only three days ago during interrogation in Parliament, Nakasone had declared 
that his testimony under oath itself constituted a "misogi" (ceremonial 
absolution of sins) for the scandal. He also said he had no intention of 
resigning the seat he has held in the lower house of Parliament for 42 years. 
Factions of the ruling party's members of both houses of Parliament, who pledge 
loyalty to their leader in exchange for patronage and financial support, 
control the power within the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
Although both leaders have denied any wrongdoing, Nakasone and Takeshita have 
acknowledged receiving massive funds from Recruit Co., an information and real 
estate conglomerate at the core of the influence-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, who on April 25 announced he would resign to assume his portion of 
responsibility for the scandal, called Nakasone's move "a fine decision." Asked 
if he himself was prepared to leave the party, Takeshita cited his effort to 
round up a consensus for a successor and said, "I have no intention of saying 
anything about that now." 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister ran into the first snag Sunday night in his effort to hand 
his job to Uno when he met ex-Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, who returned earlier 
in the day from a trip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuda bluntly told Takeshita that he was "astounded" to see news reports 
appear while he was gone that the party was leaning toward the selection of Uno 
-- a statement that was taken as an expression of opposition to Uno. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuda, 84, who some party elders are supporting as Takeshita's successor, 
urged Takeshita to end the traditional practice of one leader serving as both 
party president and prime minister and give the posts to two people. Takeshita, 
however, rejected the suggestion.

PARTY'S SUPPORT WEAK AS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION NEARS

PRUSZKOW, Poland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the election campaign in Poland moves into its final week, Waclaw 
Wojciechowski, 42, has come to realize his greatest liability -- he is a 
candidate of the PZPR, the Communist Party that has ruled Poland for the last 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
As he and others here have discovered, this is such grim baggage for a Polish 
politician to haul about that the usual official symbols of the "worker's 
party" -- the red flags and the hammer and sickle -- are nowhere to be found on 
poster or leaflet. Even the innocuous party initials, if present at all, are 
set in type discreet enough to strain the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Wojciechowski sighed, "these days belonging to the party is a certain 
handicap." 
</P>
<P>
Wojciechowski was out on the campaign trail Sunday, sitting quietly on the 
porch of the town cultural center in the not very lively hope that a few voters 
might seek him out for a discussion of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
The voters, however, were mostly milling in the surrounding park, lining up to 
buy such rarities as chocolate cookies and panty hose, sold from the backs of 
trucks. These scarce commodities, along with an exhibition of folk dancing to 
provide a festive background, were all organized by the party's coalition 
candidates to lure an electorate that is skeptical in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be joking," answered one woman, standing in line to buy chocolates, 
when she was asked if she intended to vote for the party. 
</P>
<P>
Her vote, in those races where she has a clear choice, will go to the 
candidates backed by Solidarity, which is participating for the first time in 
the most competitive elections to be held in Poland since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the campaign heads toward the first round of voting next Sunday, 
there is apprehension, even among Solidarity's strategists, over the party's 
apparently dismal support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to All Comers 
</P>
<P>
In the elections, 100 members of a newly created Senate will be chosen in a 
fully democratic vote, open to all comers, including the party and Solidarity, 
which has fielded candidates for all 100 races. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 420 members of the lower house, or Sejm, will also be chosen, but 
those seats have been apportioned already, with 65% to go to the party and its 
allies and 35% open to opposition candidates. 
</P>
<P>
These proportions, hammered out in long negotiations between Solidarity and the 
government, will guarantee the Communists at least a slim majority in the 
National Assembly, even if Solidarity candidates were to win all 100 seats in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's polls, in Warsaw, show its candidates winning in every contest for 
which it is eligible by margins of up to 7 to 1. Although the gap in rural 
areas is thought to be narrower, most political activists say that Solidarity 
has a clear edge in the countryside as well. It is possible, some observers now 
say, that Solidarity and its opposition allies could win 90 out of 100 seats in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Party officials have become openly alarmed, charging that Solidarity's 
candidates are violating the spirit of the round-table agreements reached in 
April, which provided the basis for the current "non-confrontational" 
elections. They charge that it is unfair for Solidarity to launch blanket 
attacks against official candidates, charging them with responsibility for 40 
years of economic failure in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate voices from both the official and opposition sides have voiced 
apprehension over the possibility that the party could be grossly embarrassed 
in the elections. Their misgivings stem from the fear that party hard-liners 
could launch a backlash against reforms if they see the threat against the 
party as immediate and final. 
</P>
<P>
A Solidarity candidate for the Senate, longtime activist Jacek Kuron, is among 
those counseling for moderation. At a campaign appearance in Warsaw, he 
cautioned a questioner from the audience who called for a more aggressive and 
sweeping campaign against the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that is a good idea," Kuron said. "I have studied revolutions, 
and I don't think that is what we need here. Right now we have people standing 
in line for meat, but if we have a revolution, there will be no meat at all. 
What we want is an evolutionary rebuilding of the system with the cooperation 
of the Communists, because only the Communists can guarantee peaceful change. 
Perhaps we will be proved wrong, but there is no other way but to try." 
</P>
<P>
The government's growing nervousness was evident when a Warsaw court recently 
refused to grant legal status to the independent students' organization, NZS, a 
clear backtracking on the round-table agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing the grim mood in the party, Solidarity's reaction was mild. Solidarity 
leader Lech Walesa issued a statement supporting the students, thereby ending 
occupation strikes on university campuses from Warsaw to Krakow. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's mild rhetoric is a clear reflection of both its popular and 
organizational strength. When the election campaign began three weeks ago, 
Solidarity strategists believed it had a clear disadvantage against a Communist 
organization that was already in place. But, within days, Solidarity supporters 
had collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to get their candidates 
placed on the ballots, and campaign offices sprang up in virtually every town 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between Solidarity and party campaign offices is sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past weekend, the Communist coalition's main office was deserted at 3 
p.m. on Saturday afternoon except for a functionary sitting alone reading 
newspapers. At Solidarity headquarters, six blocks away, 30 to 40 persons were 
at work, bundling up leaflets for distribution, selling campaign buttons and 
posters and manning information booths for passers-by. Officials on duty were 
available for interviews. The mood, throughout, was festive. 
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Urbanik, one of the volunteers on duty, was looking at the results of a 
new poll. It was only a small sample, 200 persons, but it showed Solidarity 
winning 65% to 70% of the choices, 3% to 5% for the party, with the rest 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing pretty well, I think," Urbanik said. "Anyway, we're having a good 
time."

ULTRALIGHT FLIGHT OVER BERLIN WALL;

<P>
Two West Germans appear to have staged one of the most audacious escapes ever 
from East Berlin by swooping over the Berlin Wall in ultralight aircraft to 
snatch their East German brother and bring him to the West. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ingo and Holger Bethke's account -- backed by video footage shot 
in the air -- the two flimsy planes took off Friday night from a West Berlin 
sports field and flew low over the heavily-guarded wall dividing the city. 
</P>
<P>
One of camouflaged aircraft landed in a park near East Berlin's Soviet War 
Memorial to pick up their brother, Egbert, while the other ultralight circled 
overhead, the former East German citizens told police over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The planes, much like powered hang gliders, then flew low over the Berlin Wall 
again and landed in front of the old German Parliament, the Reichstag. 
</P>
<P>
The men abandoned the planes and drove off to celebrate the escape operation, 
which took less than 20 minutes. Ingo and Holger themselves escaped from the 
East -- in 1974 and 1983 respectively, the West German magazine Quick reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that so far, the story matched the facts. But they and the Western 
Allies who control West Berlin could not confirm the escape with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
Allied sources said British officials were quizzing the rescued brother at a 
West Berlin reception camp for East Bloc refugees.

COURT PANEL CLEARS SEN. BIDEN OF UNIVERSITY PLAGIARISM CHARGE

<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) has been cleared of the college plagiarism 
charge that helped to lead to his departure from the 1988 presidential race, 
the Wilmington News Journal reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At Biden's request, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed the allegation in 1987. 
The court's Board of Professional Responsibility exonerated the senator Dec. 
21, 1987, said L. Susan Faw, independent disciplinary counsel for the panel, 
which prosecutes allegations of unethical behavior against attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Faw said she had recommended to the court's Preliminary Review Committee, a 
panel of lawyers and non-lawyers with authority to recommend prosecution, that 
the matter be dismissed. The charge was later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I had it in the back of my mind that this was more of a personal 
vindication than a political one," Biden said about his decision to delay 
announcing the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation of plagiarism involved an essay Biden wrote in 1965 while a 
freshman at Syracuse University. Biden received an "F" on the paper for relying 
almost exclusively on a Fordham Law Review article, which he cited heavily with 
footnotes. He said he was allowed to repeat the course and passed with high 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
Faw would not release details of the investigation, likening it to the 
confidential proceedings of a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Biden told the newspaper that a faculty review concluded the essay was "a poor 
academic job by the six-week law school freshman, but not a disciplinary or 
moral problem." 
</P>
<P>
The allegation of plagiarism and other controversies forced Biden, who is 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to abandon his quest for the 
Democratic presidential nomination on Sept. 23, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Biden has indicated he will run for reelection in 1990 and has said he may run 
for President as soon as 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with the media for the first time about his exoneration, Biden told the 
newspaper: "I felt very relieved because the reason I initiated this whole 
thing was that it was the only thing throughout the entire presidential (race) 
that genuinely bothered me. Because I knew all the rest would be put into 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Although the plagiarism allegations dogged Biden, the most damaging impact on 
Biden's campaign came from the so-called "attack video" distributed to 
reporters by an aide to rival Democratic candidate Massachusetts Gov. Michael 
S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
The video showed Biden using the words and ideas of British Labor Party leader 
Neil Kinnock without attribution. Biden contends that he usually attributed the 
quotes, and he called the omissions an oversight.

ESSENTIAL TYPES OF MICE IN SHORT SUPPLY; 
</P>
<P>
LAB FIRE TAKING TOLL ON MEDICAL STUDIES

<P>
The fire alarm shattered the tranquility of the Jackson Laboratory's 94-acre 
campus at about 1 p.m. on May 10, and within five minutes, smoke was pouring 
out of the lab's hangar-like production building. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze spread with horrifying speed. By the time the flames were out the 
next morning, the body count was at least 350,000 -- fully half the stock of 
laboratory mice this one-of-a-kind facility supplies to scientists around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"When I picked up the paper and saw that headline, I almost died. We get a 
standing order of almost a hundred a week," said Mary Wood of New England 
Deaconess Hospital, who is trying to come up with ways to help the human body 
accept transplanted organs. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, however, turned out to be one of the lucky ones. The supply of the type 
of inbred mice she needs was less affected than some of the other 1,700 strains 
that Jackson produces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extent of Loss Unclear 
</P>
<P>
It is still too early to assess the full effect of the fire, which started from 
fumes during construction work. No strain of mouse was wiped out. One thing is 
clear, though: Some medical and scientific research projects across the country 
are going to see delays -- perhaps of many months -- until the nonprofit, 
private laboratory gets back to its full production of 3 million mice a year. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for example, researchers were all set 
to begin testing a promising drug for arthritis this summer. What they lacked 
was mice of the one strain in which the disease can be induced. 
</P>
<P>
"The project now has to be put on hold because we can't get those mice any 
more," said Chella David, an immunology professor. "The Jackson lab has told me 
it will be a minimum of six months before they can even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
A colleague studying multiple sclerosis also needs an exotic strain, David 
said, and is "scrounging around to see if he can get the mice anywhere else, 
and so far, we have not found a source in the United States. We understand 
there might be a source in Europe where we can buy them, but there's a lot of 
restrictions on bringing mice from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Jackson is not even shipping any of the surviving mice. It will be 
weeks before the lab can be sure they were not affected by their brief exposure 
to the atmosphere during the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will rebuild its inventory by breeding its so-called "foundation 
stocks," the ancestors of the lost mice. Officials said they do not believe 
they will have to tap their other backup source, half a million eight-celled 
embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen, which could be implanted in surrogate-mother 
mice. Those reserves were put in place after the last major fire at Jackson, in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
There are other places that breed mice for laboratory research, but most offer 
only half a dozen strains or so, compared to Jackson Laboratory's 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
"Other companies are gearing up to take up some of the slack, but the 
specialized strains -- that's where the problem will be," said Jesse O. 
Washington, campus veterinarian at UCLA, who estimated the university's orders 
from Jackson at about 10,000 mice a year. 
</P>
<P>
What is just as important, scientists throughout the country say, is that no 
one else can touch Jackson when it comes to assuring that a lab mouse is 
healthy and meets exact genetic specifications. 
</P>
<P>
"You know when you buy a mouse from them that you're getting what you think 
you're getting. They are absolutely rigorous about their genetic controls. And 
many other places -- I'll be honest with you -- they may supply you with mice 
for half the price, but you pay for it in the long run," said Marylou 
Oster-Granite, a developmental geneticist at Johns Hopkins, which orders up to 
400 mice a week from Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
In building a better mouse it takes a long time -- at least 20 mouse 
generations -- and a lot of patience, to be certain that all the mice of any 
inbred strain have precisely the same genetic makeup. Two strains, C57BL/6J and 
DBA-27, date back hundreds of generations, to the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, a mutation occurs in breeding that could prove important to 
science. In such cases, it often takes seven years for the Jackson Laboratory 
to develop the new strain. 
</P>
<P>
Mice are uniquely useful in research because they are small, relatively 
inexpensive (Jackson's prices range from about $3 to $100 per animal) and their 
genetic makeup closely resembles that of humans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIDS Research Furthered 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, working with Stanford University and other centers, last year 
implanted a human immune system into a mouse that had no immunities of its own. 
Until then, there was no animal in which the deadly acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, or AIDS, could be precisely reproduced. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of inbreeding leave various strains susceptible to certain 
diseases, which is exactly what scientists need but also means the strains are 
incredibly fragile. In some areas at Jackson, humans must go through three 
pressurized chambers, shower and change their clothes before they are allowed 
to enter the room with the mice. 
</P>
<P>
Other facilities have offered Jackson space for breeding, but their quality 
control is not good enough for reproducing some strains. 
</P>
<P>
Frantic scientists have been calling the Institute of Laboratory Animal 
Resources in Washington for help. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone has not stopped ringing with people trying to find animals that used 
to be available at Jackson," the institute's senior program officer, Dorothy 
Greenhouse, said. "We can't get anything else done." 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers have been desperate enough to try breeding mice in their own 
labs, and are scurrying to find mates for what mice they already have. For many 
strains, however, breeding is far from a simple match-making proposition, 
Greenhouse said. One of the strains most in demand, for example, is the New 
Zealand Black, which develops an auto-immune disease similar to systemic lupus 
erythematosus, a debilitating rheumatic affliction related to arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that they're difficult to breed because the female mice have a 
nasty habit of eating their young," Greenhouse said. "There are ways around it, 
but unless you know the tricks of the trade, you have difficulty getting a 
colony established." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kenneth Paigen, a Berkeley genetics professor who will become Jackson's 
director on July 1, said in an interview Saturday that the laboratory's 
insurance probably will be inadequate to cover a reconstruction and 
modernization project that will cost tens of millions of dollars. He is 
determined, he added, that it not drain resources from the Nobel Prize-winning 
research done at Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to tap private sources, such as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
companies that use Jackson mice, and other potential donors. Paigen added that 
Maine's congressional delegation is working to see if some federal help is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, one of the projects affected by the Jackson fire was research 
being done by Paigen's wife, Beverly Paigen, who is senior research biochemist 
at Oakland Children's Hospital. She has a three-year, $1-million grant to study 
the relationship of dairy fat in the diet to heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is the largest employer in this picturesque tourist village on 
Frenchman Bay. It had about 500 employees and has already had to lay off 60 of 
them. Spokeswoman Barbara K. Trevett said further layoffs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Paigen said that one of his chief concerns will be making certain the facility 
is rebuilt so that it will not again be susceptible to a sweeping fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact on the national medical research is greater than even we would have 
guessed," he said. "This is never going to happen again, period."

FUNGUS THAT INFECTED 7 PATIENTS STUMPS HOSPITAL

Officials at Riverside Community Hospital have failed to determine how a fungus 
infected seven heart surgery patients, prompting closure of the facility's 
cardio-surgical unit. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's medical board has scheduled a meeting Tuesday to decide when 
elective heart surgery and angioplasty may resume, said Robert A. Minkin, the 
hospital's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
Non-emergency heart surgery and cardiac angioplasty were halted May 18 after 
four of the hospital's heart surgeons reported a fungus, Candida albicans, 
growing in the chest incisions of seven patients. Angioplasty is a procedure 
that helps open clogged blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The infections produced tenderness and small pimples and were discovered during 
post-operative examinations. The fungus is commonly found under the arms and in 
the genital area but does not usually develop into an infection in a patient 
with a healthy immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the patients who did not respond to oral medicines were readmitted and 
given more potent medication at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We've checked every conceivable place where the patients had contact in the 
hospital," Minkin said. "We went to every place between the front door and 
point of discharge and found no discernible cause for the transmission." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the outbreak, the hospital plans to monitor surgery patients 
released from the hospital for signs of infection, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Thorsen, chief of disease control for the county health department, 
said the department is satisfied with the hospital's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William R. Jarvis, a specialist with the Centers for Disease Control, said 
about 5% of all hospital patients acquire an infection while hospitalized. Up 
to 15% of heart surgery patients develop infections at the hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Community Hospital's open-heart surgery program, the first to be 
developed in western Riverside County, began Jan. 19, 1987. The hospital 
performs about 200 heart surgeries a year.

AGAINST METS, DODGERS WIN IN A BALKOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither the New York Mets nor Dodgers are scoring much these days, so Sunday's 
extra-inning ending was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McDowell's balk with none out in the 12th inning scored Dave Anderson to 
give the Dodgers a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
'It's a judgment call,' Mets Manager Davey Johnson said. "I hate to see it 
happen. If you're going to call it, call it early. It's putting the game in the 
umpire's hands and that's not the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell (1-4) walked Anderson on four pitches leading off the inning and 
Willie Randolph, who was four for six, singled to left after failing to 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
On the first pitch to John Shelby, catcher Barry Lyons tried to pick Anderson 
off second but threw wildly into center field for an error allowing the runners 
to move up a base. 
</P>
<P>
With a 2-1 count on Shelby, a balk was called on McDowell by umpire Bob 
Davidson for failing to come to a stop in the set position. 
</P>
<P>
"He said I bounced and never stopped," McDowell said. "It's the same move I 
make everytime. I think I've been pitching fine. But there's no excuse for 
walking that leadoff hitter on four pitches. I go home at nights wondering what 
I might have done to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Searage (3-2) pitched two innings and allowed two hits for the victory as 
the Dodgers took two of three weekend games from New York. Overall, the Dodgers 
have won four of six from the Mets this season after dropping 10 of 11 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers leading 3-1, Darryl Strawberry led off the seventh with a walk 
to chase Fernando Valenzuela and one out later Tim Teufel doubled to left off 
Alejandro Pena. Tim Crews relieved, and after Lyons struck out, pinch-hitter 
Gregg Jefferies lifted a fly ball double to left to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden pitched six innings before giving way to Rick Aguilera. Gooden 
allowed three runs on nine hits. Aguilera struck out six in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was trying for his first victory of the season and first since June 
14, 1988. In six innings, he allowed three hits and two runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Fernando pitched a super game," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"There have been three or four games Fernando could have won if we'd have 
gotten him a few runs. He should have at least four victories." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph doubled with one out in the first and scored on Mike Davis' double to 
right to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gwynn led off the third with a single, moved to third on Randolph's 
hit-and-run single and scored on Davis' single. After Eddie Murray fanned, Mike 
Marshall singled home Randolph to make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball was just OK," Gooden said. "My curve ball was what hurt me. I kept 
getting the ball up in the strike zone. Seven hits in the first three innings 
is way too many. The hard thing to understand is today I felt the best I've 
felt in my last four or five starts. Without the curve they just sat and waited 
for my fastball.' 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the fifth, Kevin McReynolds singled, moved to second on a walk 
and scored on Lyons' single to move the Mets within 3-1.

AGAINST METS, DODGERS WIN IN A BALKOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has still been almost a year since Fernando Valenzuela registered a win. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, however, Valenzuela pitched well enough to help the Dodgers register a 
win that only seemed like it took a year. 
</P>
<P>
Though it eventually may have if plate umpire Bob Davidson hadn't called a balk 
on Roger McDowell, allowing the Dodgers to score the decisive run in a 4-3, 
12-inning victory over the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell and Manager Dave Johnson disputed the call, of course. But Davidson 
said it wasn't even borderline, that McDowell failed to come to a stop in his 
motion while pitching to John Shelby, permitting Dave Anderson to trot in from 
third with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to call a balk in that situation, but he definitely bounced (rather 
than stopping)," Davidson said. "They took discernible stop out (of the balk 
rule this year), but he still has to stop." 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,060 saw Ray Searage, the fifth Dodger pitcher, 
gain the victory after Valenzuela worked six-plus innings, allowing only three 
hits, two walks and two runs. 
</P>
<P>
He left with a 3-1 lead after a leadoff walk to Darryl Strawberry in the 
seventh, then saw Tim Teufel rip a one-out double off Alexandro Pena, bringing 
on Tim Crews, who struck out Barry Lyons only to have Gregg Jefferies bloop a 
game tying double to left, depriving Valenzuela of a shot at the win. 
</P>
<P>
As Jefferies' flare fell inches fair, Manager Tom Lasorda said he turned to 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski and said, "What a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Later, alluding to the 18 starts Valenzuela has now made since his last win, 
Lasorda said: 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically he needs a win more than anything. The greatest confidence 
builder we could give him would be a victory. That's why I got him out of there 
after the walk (to Strawberry). I wanted him to go out with the lead and have 
the chance at the win." 
</P>
<P>
In his struggle to rebuild the strength in his shoulder and recapture a measure 
of his lost velocity, Valenzuela has made nine starts this year. He called this 
one his best. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw more strikes, I kept the leadoff man off base and I was able to pitch 
inside," he said. "That (pitching inside) was my style before, but it's tough 
to do when you don't have control and that's been my problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get the win, but the team did and that's more important. And I'm very 
happy with what I did. My arm felt strong and that's the main thing. I know the 
wins will come in time." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Lasorda said, Valenzuela shouldn't still be looking for that first 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep asking me how long we're going to go with him," Lasorda said. "And 
I answer that he should have won three or four games by now if we had scored 
any runs for him. 
</P>
<P>
"If he keeps the ball down and stays ahead of the hitter like he did today, 
he's going to win. We just have to score for him. We just have to start getting 
hits with two outs, big hits with runners in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers stranded 14 runners in a 2-1 victory Saturday night and 10 more 
while getting 13 hits Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, who has hit .329 over his last 21 games to improve his average 
to .264, had a double and three singles. Mike Davis, who has hit .333 in his 
last 13 starts, had a double and two singles. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden, 6-2 for the season and 9-1 against the Dodger for his career, 
started Sunday but lacked his customary velocity, allowing nine hits while 
striking out only two in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles by Randolph and Davis got the Dodgers one run in the first. Four 
singles, including a pair by Randolph and Davis, led to two more runs in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, still batting a major-league low .228, didn't score again until 
the 12th. Eddie Murray struck out three times and is batting .208 in May. Kirk 
Gibson, giving his still tender hamstring a rest in the wake of a night game, 
didn't appear until he singled as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, batting only slightly better at .234, were limited to eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
Crews rebounded from the Jefferies double to strike out five in 2 2/3 innings. 
Jay Howell worked two scoreless innings and has not allowed a run in his last 
16 1/3. Searage yielded a pair of singles in the Mets' 12th, but got Mookie 
Wilson to ground into a force play with two outs, then gained his third win 
against two defeats in the home half. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson opened the inning by walking on four pitches. Randolph fouled off two 
sacrifice attempts, then singled to left. John Shelby, who flied out as a 
pinch-hitter in the ninth and is batting .169, was next. 
</P>
<P>
In an obvious sacrifice situation, McDowell's first pitch was high. Catcher 
Barry Lyons whipped a throw to second, but bounced it into center field, 
allowing both Anderson and Randolph to advance. 
</P>
<P>
The count went to two and one. Shelby swung at a fastball and fouled it off. 
Davidson waved his arms, calling the balk. An exultant Lasorda leaped from the 
dugout -- an easier trick now that he's down to 180 pounds -- with his arms 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to Billy Russell and didn't see McDowell make the pitch," he 
said later, "but I saw it on the replay and could see he didn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell shook his head and said: 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like that. I did the same thing when Anderson was on 
base and the same thing on the two pitches to Shelby (after Randolph reached 
base). It puts the game in the hands of the umpires and that's not the way it 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last year's balk epidemic, the removal of the "discernible stop" 
phrase has significantly cut down on the call. 
</P>
<P>
Of this one, Manager Johnson said he was riled because it came long after 
delivery of the pitch and in a decisive situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him (Davidson), 'Let the players decide it, let the Dodgers beat us.' 
He took out of the players' hands, but I'm more upset that we walked the 
leadoff man in the 12th inning on four pitches than I am with the balk." 
</P>
<P>
After losing 10 of 11 regular season games to the Mets last year, the Dodgers 
have now won four of the first six this year. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there were those four of seven they won from the Mets in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Further examination of shortstop Mariano Duncan, who went on the 15-day 
disabled list Saturday night with a three-stitch cut between the ring finger 
and little finger of his right hand, disclosed that Duncan also suffered a 
sprain in the joint below the cut.

LAKERS SWEEP INTO NBA FINALS AGAIN, 122-117

<P>
Somewhere out there probably lives an opponent who can beat the Lakers, for a 
game or maybe even an entire National Basketball Assn. playoff series, though 
that team's whereabouts have yet to be located. 
</P>
<P>
It could turn up in Chicago or Detroit, and it could happen as early as next 
week. But it most certainly was not the Phoenix Suns, the latest challenger to 
be swept aside posthaste by a Laker team said to be playing as well as any of 
their predecessors this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals, the Lakers completed the 
four-game eclipse of the Suns with a 122-117 victory that improved their 
playoff record to 11-0 and sent observers searching for comparable teams. 
</P>
<P>
They advance to the NBA finals for the seventh time in the last eight seasons. 
They also join the 1982 Lakers as the only teams ever to head into the finals 
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball historian that he is, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reached into the past and 
plucked a pretty good team from memory, one that conceivably could match or 
surpass the Lakers in winning streaks and versatility. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the Bruins, man," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
That would be the UCLA team of the late '60s that lost only one game during 
Abdul-Jabbar's time. 
</P>
<P>
All right, so that comparison is a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers are playing at a level hardly anyone thought them capable of 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Always in control," Magic Johnson said. "This team never -- I don't know what 
the word is to describe it -- never gets scared. We just say, 'OK, let's make 
the play and win the game.' We always felt in control." 
</P>
<P>
Even though they are near the top of their game, it took nearly all the Lakers 
had to beat the Suns, led by Tom Chambers' 41 points, in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
They got it from Byron Scott, who had 35 points including his three three-point 
baskets, from Johnson, who had 21 points and 20 assists, from Worthy, who had 
20 points and eight rebounds and from the reserves, Orlando Woolridge, Michael 
Cooper and Mychal Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, playing well after a disappointing regular-season, scored 14 points, 
made six of 10 shots, had seven rebounds and five blocked shots. Cooper sank 
two three-point baskets and continued to play well defensively against Sun 
point guard Kevin Johnson, who had 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to avoid a poor start, as in Game 4 of the Seattle series, the Lakers 
sprinted to an 11-0 lead in the game's first two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And, wanting to finish off the series rather than waiting to try to win it at 
home Tuesday, the Lakers sank 10 consecutive free throws in the final 1:07 
after allowing the Suns to slash a 12-point deficit to two. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's just our time," Riley said. "There is no explaining it, 
really. I think we'd be tough for anyone to beat in a seven-game series. I 
think now, our guys are proving they want to win as badly as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Each and every game, (the Lakers) have played singularly. They haven't looked 
ahead. To me, the mark of character is not coming back after being down. It's 
playing like we did today, maintaining it. They took care of business today." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' early surge went like this: an Abdul-Jabbar hook shot, a Phoenix 
turnover, a fast-break layup by Scott, a Phoenix turnover, a fast-break basket 
by A.C. Green, a blocked shot, a Scott jump shot, a missed Sun shot, and a 
three-point basket by Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, 2 1/2 minutes into the game, the Suns scored when Mark West dunked. 
That turned out to be the start of a 16-3 Phoenix run that gave the Suns a 
16-14 lead with 5:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
That was Phoenix's last lead of the game. The Lakers then proceeded with a 10-0 
run, highlighted by two fast-break layups by Worthy and Cooper's three-point 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the fourth quarter did the Suns seriously challenge again. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lakers had taken a 106-94 lead with 5:25 to play, the Suns outscored 
them 11-2. Included in that stretch were three Laker turnovers -- two by 
Johnson and one by Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
But whenever the Suns surged, the Lakers responded, quickly increasing their 
lead from three to seven. 
</P>
<P>
The few defensive mistakes the Lakers made came in the final two minutes. 
Phoenix came within 112-108 when Chambers completed a three-point play after 
being fouled by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Suns would get three-point baskets from Dan Majerle and Eddie Johnson 
and a three-point play by Kevin Johnson in the final minute, getting as close 
as 116-114 with 53 seconds left. But the Lakers' free throws clinched it. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made the plays," Magic Johnson said. "We made a couple of mental 
mistakes . . . but we corrected it from there. Today, they kept coming back, 
coming back. But we made the plays." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy said he was concerned about the Lakers' defensive mistakes in the fourth 
quarter, which led to 17 of Chambers' 41 points and which almost led to a Laker 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Almost. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in battles before, and we know down the stretch we have to make the 
plays," Worthy said. "We never panic. Now, today, we did make some mental 
mistakes and that almost cost us. But we did a good job of executing when we 
absolutely had to." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers expect nothing less from Scott, who made 13-of-18 shots and the 
other starters. But the play of Woolridge has been a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"Orlando has been our MVP in this series," said reserve center Mychal Thompson, 
who added nine points. "Well, Magic is always our MVP, but Orlando has done 
everything we've asked him to. More than that. He's been the difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' defense didn't hurt, either. The Suns made 47.9% of their shots 
Sunday, which was a good day for them. Chambers finally scored the way the 
Suns' faithful had expected, making 17-of-28 shots and grabbing 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers' strategy was to shut off at least two of the Suns' three main 
scorers. Kevin Johnson was contained, finishing with 22 points and 10 assists. 
And sixth man Eddie Johnson made just six of 14 shots, shooting poorly from the 
start of the series to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix shot just 46.8% for the series. Eddie Johnson made just 32.7% of his 
shots and Chambers needed a hot hand Sunday to boost his to 43.6% for the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"What they concentrated on was shutting down Tom and myself," Eddie Johnson 
said. "You have to give them credit. They did a great job of denying me the 
ball. I couldn't come off the picks and catch the ball with any rhythm. 
Usually, they were switching out there and had a guy in my face." 
</P>
<P>
Added Kevin Johnson: "On defense, they really stuck together and sucked it up. 
When you play a team in a seven-game series, you become familiar with them. So, 
they really had a chance to focus on us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Magic Johnson: "In this series, the difference for them was that they've 
never played the Lakers' playoff team before," he said. "They've seen what it 
is all about right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott: "Nobody expected us even to make it this far. This was one of those 
years where we've been written off from the start. But we never thought that." 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, though, the Lakers also never thought they would be undefeated 
in the playoffs going into the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we never thought we'd sweep Phoenix," Scott said. "We didn't think we'd 
sweep Seattle, either. It just happens." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley on his preferred opponent, either Chicago or Detroit in 
the finals: "I would say I'd only prefer Chicago because it gives us the 
home-court advantage. It's not as if we feel we can beat them easier. Both 
teams are tough." . . . The earliest the finals can start will be Sunday. Riley 
gave the Lakers a day off today and probably will take the team to Santa 
Barbara for a "mini-training camp" later in the week. . . . Dating back to the 
last five games of the regular season, the Lakers have won 16 consecutive 
games. . . . Riley has 98 career playoff coaching victories. He needs one more 
to tie Red Auerbach, the all-time leader with 99.

JIM MURRAY: LITTLE AL UNSER SPINS WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE

<P>
Emerson Fittipaldi, who fights out of Brazil, won the heavyweight championship 
of racing Sunday with a 15th-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Kayoed was Al Unser Jr. who was ahead on all cards at the time, when he ran 
into a picture-book right that sent young Unser crashing to the floor and a 
10-count for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, "Was it a clean shot?" Look at it this way: If you knock a guy 
out with a foul, do you get the title? Remember Jack Sharkey knocked out Max 
Schmeling in a title fight in 1930 but the ruling was, the knockout was a low 
blow. Schmeling was named champion, though on the floor at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Emerson Fittipaldi-Al Unser Jr. slugfest at Indy Sunday was a throwback 
auto race. Only in old Hollywood movies do you see wheel-to-wheel racing of the 
kind popularized by Clark Gable movies where his rival for the affections of 
Loretta Young is usually depicted as crowding him homicidally into a wall on 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
But Emmo and Little Al turned the clock back Sunday to the days when racing 
cars were not just complicated missiles controlled by an instrument panel as 
futuristic as a spaceship. They went at each other like Dempsey and Tunney or 
Ali and Frazier in the late stages of the 73rd Indy 500 when all the ribbon 
clerks had been run out of the pot. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the 199th lap with one to go when Fittipaldi landed the Sunday punch. 
Marciano never landed a better one. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were these: The two drivers were the only survivors, the only 
ones on lap 199, of a high speed race in which contenders were dropping out 
like swatted flies. First one, and then the other, were in the lead. It was 
like a He's up! He's down! fight. 
</P>
<P>
On Turn 3, next-to-last lap, Fittipaldi decided desperate measures were called 
for. He was like a fighter who knew he needed a knockout to win. He dove for a 
hole between Al Unser's car who was a car length ahead of him and the infield 
of the track. There was a third car, driven by an also-ran named Ludwig 
Heimrath Jr. to the outside of both of them. 
</P>
<P>
The thing you have to remember is, Fittipaldi's car was almost down in the 
infield grass when it tried to squeeze past. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the rules of racing at Indy this year called for all cars to remain above 
a white line drawn around the track oval just in from the infield dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson Fittipaldi's whole car was below that white line. Now, the question 
becomes -- does the fact that Fittipaldi was there require that Unser make a 
racing decision to give him room? Should Unser have gone around, or squeezed 
over on Heimrath? Or did the fact Fittipaldi was taking a questionable shortcut 
disenfranchise him? If it was football, would they have dropped a flag? If it 
was horse racing, would they have taken down the number? If baseball, do they 
play the game under protest? 
</P>
<P>
It's academic. In Indy, as in an alley fight, it's 
protect-yourself-at-all-times. They don't take your number down at Indy. 
Hit-and-run accidents take place all the time. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was, as the two cars came into the space with room for only one, 
Fittipaldi's right front wheel slammed into Unser's left rear. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been a double-knockout and awarded the race to a guy who was five 
laps behind at the time, albeit in third place. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was Little Al who took the count. Fittipaldi by a knockout. He 
flattened him. The good news is, he didn't kill him. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of racing you all too seldom see anymore. Cars fight at long 
range like battleships, or missile frigates, in these times. 
</P>
<P>
But, when you get knocked out of the biggest prize in racing when you're 
leading with only a little more than a lap to go, what do you do? Go home and 
kick the dog? Yell at the kids? Punch walls? 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Foyt would have punched the driver who did it to him. Pit brawls have 
broken out over less at stock-car racing. 
</P>
<P>
Young Al Unser, as soon as he was able to crawl out of the charred, mangled 
hunk of metal that had been his race car, stood trackside and applauded his 
tormentor and raised thumbs-up in tribute to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just congratulating Emmo on a terrific piece of driving," he was to say 
with apparent sincerity. "I was cheering for him because he's one of the 
world's great drivers. I was very impressed with his driving." 
</P>
<P>
Try that the next time somebody bumps you into the guard-rail on the Santa 
Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Young Master Unser showed up at his post-race news conference with the big 
smile of a kid who has just been to his first circus. Little Al could play Baby 
Face Nelson without makeup. You see him and you want to take him to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
But, he was so understanding about the accident, he'd ruin the movie script. He 
almost acted as if he had it coming to him. Did he think it was his fault, an 
incredulous sportswriter asked him. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it my fault? No," shot back Unser. "I had my front end in front of him but 
neither one of us was going to 'lift' (take his foot off the accelerator in 
close quarters) in that situation. I know I wasn't going to lift. And I sure 
knew Emerson wasn't going to lift, either." 
</P>
<P>
Did he know what the risks were? Unser smiles wryly. "I knew only one car was 
going to come out of that," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
Did a veteran driver outslicker the kid? Fittipaldi is a quondam world champion 
Formula One driver who left the chic circuits of the French Riviera to take up 
the neighborhood garage, brutish oval racing of Indy. There are few tricks of 
any kind of racing unknown to Emmo. 
</P>
<P>
Would he have been able to do that to an older Unser? To a Foyt, Johnny 
Rutherford -- even a Ray Harroun? 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi is recognized as rough competition by the Indy trade. He's no silk 
scarf, monocle driver, even though he knows too well what salad fork to use. 
You go into the corners with Fittipaldi about as optimistically as you would go 
in Gestapo headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
He had to stave off several generations of the Unser family, Andretti family, 
to say nothing of the Bettenhausens and other familiar syllables of Indy track 
to win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He did it with a right that would rank in history with the one Marciano used to 
deck Walcott with. Kid Unser never saw it coming. That's why the title is going 
to Brazil this weekend and the Unsers have still another car in a bag to go 
with the dozens of others they've hung on a wall in their colorful Speedway 
history. The Unsers make more history here than a roomful of Hoosier 
politicians -- including Dan Quayle.

AFTER STUNNING LOSS, PISTONS TRY TO BOUNCE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons, down two games to one to the Chicago Bulls in the National 
Basketball Assn.'s Eastern Conference finals, can regain home-court advantage 
in the series by taking today's Game 4 at Chicago Stadium, which will begin at 
noon (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
To do so, the Pistons must first get over the shock of losing last Saturday's 
game, the one Michael Jordan won for Chicago with three seconds to play, 99-97, 
after Detroit had led most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to recover emotionally," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. "That 
was a tough one to take." 
</P>
<P>
What surprises Daly is the way his team has been unable to put away Chicago, 
even though several key Bulls have played in sub-par physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 2, Bull forward Scottie Pippen sat out the final 13 minutes with an 
injured foot, and Jordan and center Bill Cartwright were weakened by the flu. 
Saturday, Pippen played with discomfort, and fellow forward Horace Grant was 
the latest flu victim. Grant, who had 20 rebounds in Game 2, was so queasy that 
he rushed to the locker room with the game in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor Pippen scored in double figures, and Grant had but three 
rebounds. But Chicago won. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's 46 points carried the Bulls, and Daly said Sunday, "We have to start 
doing something differently on defense -- and, I think in particular, Isiah 
Thomas has to." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas does not guard Jordan, but Chicago backup guard John Paxson hurt Detroit 
with 12 points, mostly with Thomas on him. Jordan's defense limited Thomas to 
five points. Thomas had scored 33 in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that Thomas had reinjured his left hand early in 
Saturday's game, when Jordan stripped the ball from him, but Thomas denied it. 
Thomas fractured a bone in that hand several weeks ago, and Coach Doug Collins 
of the Bulls noticed that Isiah dangled his hand behind him during portions of 
Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
With Thomas and Bill Laimbeer (four points) lagging offensively, Detroit 
forward Mark Aguirre had his best game of the playoffs, 25 points. It was the 
kind of scoring the Pistons expected from Aguirre after acquiring him from 
Dallas for Adrian Dantley. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, for one, claimed he was glad to have Dantley gone. 
</P>
<P>
"A.D. gave us more problems," Jordan said. "He was the type of guy when the 
game was close to isolate and cause problems for us. It seemed like he was 
always getting fouls or a basket." 
</P>
<P>
At key moments late in Game 3, when Detroit needed a basket, Aguirre would be 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
After Jordan scored with three seconds remaining to put Chicago ahead, 99-97, 
Daly did make a substitution -- but brought in Vinnie Johnson, not Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was wide open after the inbounds pass, but Laimbeer didn't see him. 
Instead, he passed to Dumars, whose three-point shot struck the backboard hard 
and clanged off the front of the rim. Had it gone in, this series would be 2-1, 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, adverse conditions seem to follow us everywhere we go," 
Laimbeer said. "But, we're usually good at recovering." 
</P>
<P>
That remains to be seen. Detroit, like Chicago, is trying to win the NBA title 
for the first time.

USC'S AMEND-BLACK TAKES DOUBLES TITLE

<P>
Byron Black, who was near flawless, combined with Eric Amend Sunday to give USC 
its 20th individual title in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's 
tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Trojan team outlasted UC Irvine's Mike Briggs and Trevor 
Kronemann, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, at the University of Georgia's Henry Feild 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
USC has won three of the last four doubles titles, including 1987 when Rick 
Leach and Scott Melville defeated UC Irvine's Julian Barham and Darren Yates. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come to USC you become a good doubles player because our coaches are 
so good," said Amend, a fifth-year senior. "But the thing that I'm most 
disappointed in is we never won a team championship for our coach (Dick Leach). 
He deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's singles final, Louisiana State's Donni Leaycraft overcame a shaky 
second set to defeat Nebraska's Steven Jung, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3. The unseeded Jung, 
who lives in Hacienda Heights, missed his chance to become the first player 
from a school that did not make the team field to win the title. He is the 
first Big Eight player to reach the NCAA championship match. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a smart game," said Jung, who graduated two weeks ago with a degree 
in finance. "I thought I played a winning game. I just came up short." 
</P>
<P>
Leaycraft, among those seeded nine through 16, became LSU's first NCAA tennis 
champion. A junior, he's also the first non-senior to take the NCAA title since 
Georgia's Mikael Pernfors won in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Leaycraft's strategy of sitting on the baseline and waiting for Jung to make 
mistakes worked in the first set when Jung admittedly forced the action. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Jung relaxed and lured Leaycraft into errors. He also won 
four sudden-death points. But with a 3-2 lead in the third set, Jung lost his 
patience. He hit a forehand wide on a sudden-death point that allowed Leaycraft 
to tie the set. Leaycraft won three more games to take the title. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, both Irvine players and Amend gave most of the credit to Black, a 
sophomore from Zimbabwe. He served consistently and returned nearly everything 
the Anteaters hit. He was a major reason USC broke Irvine's serve five times. 
Black held his serve each time. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept us in the match," Amend said. "If it weren't for him, we would have 
lost."

DEFENDING CHAMPION WILANDER SEEMS DEFENSELESS

Has he reached Mats point? 
</P>
<P>
Mats Wilander is fourth-seeded at the French Open, beginning today at Roland 
Garros Stadium on the fringe of the tree-lined park in the Bois de Boulogne, 
but Wilander is certainly not out of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
The last tournament Wilander won was in October at Palermo, Italy, and he finds 
himself in France with not much of a chance to win the tournament he won last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
When he lost to Jay Berger earlier this month in Rome, Wilander shouted: "I am 
finished in the head." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, at 17, Wilander won the French Open for the first of his three 
victories here. Wilander was the youngest player to win the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
But at 24, even as he is defending his championship, Wilander does not seem too 
eager. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven years ago, I won my first Grand Slam," Wilander told John Roberts of the 
Independent, a newspaper in London. "That's a long time and I'm not the kind of 
competitor that Jimmy Connors is known for. He's just amazing. My mind isn't 
that much into winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the talent McEnroe has, so I have to work harder and try to 
concentrate. It's going to be harder and harder." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander's game has always depended heavily on his will to outlast his foes. He 
would return every shot and wait for the other player to make an error or get 
tired. 
</P>
<P>
With a new coach to help him with his fitness, Wilander is working on his body. 
It's just that his tennis mind needs some work, too. This was not the case last 
year when he won three of the four Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
But after that? 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have enough of thinking about doing nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference now is that Wilander seems to have gone beyond thinking 
about it. THOMAS BONK

On the clay courts of Roland Garros Stadium, a tennis complex named for a World 
War I French fighter pilot, Ivan Lendl is on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.5-million French Open, the year's second Grand Slam event, begins today 
on the red caked clay that gets on your socks, over your shoes and sometimes in 
your heart. 
</P>

There may be no greater lover of Grand Slam tournaments than Lendl, who has won 
seven of them, including three at Roland Garros. Lendl already has the 
Australian Open title to his credit, which means he could be on his way to 
becoming this year's Mats Wilander with a victory here. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander won it last year, of course, and also the Australian and U.S. Opens, 
but has since fallen upon difficult times. His match-play record this year is 
only 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
At Roland Garros, groundskeepers drag the courts between matches, as a grounds 
crew would drag the infield at a baseball game. If Wilander's plight gets any 
worse, they may have to drag the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, on the other hand, is at the top of his game. In seven tournaments this 
year, he has reached the final six times and won five, losing only to Stefan 
Edberg at the Japan Open. In the only tournament in which Lendl did not make 
the final, he lost to John McEnroe in the semifinals of the WCT Finals in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
However, McEnroe is not playing here because of a bad back. Instead, McEnroe is 
taking this week off, then playing a grass-court event in Beckenham, England, 
to prepare for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded for the fourth consecutive year, Lendl's 33-2 record this year is 
the best by any man in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the top 20 players in the world are entered and the winner will earn 
$291,752. 
</P>
<P>
The women's singles does not seem quite as competitive as the men after the 
withdrawal of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. Back-to-back champion Steffi 
Graf becomes an even greater favorite to win her third consecutive event with 
the absence of two of her principal nemeses. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's stiffest challenge for the $257,379 championship money may come from 
second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, third-seeeded Natalia Zvereva or possibly a 
pair of 17-year-old Spaniards -- Arantxa Sanchez and Conchita Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, 19, is the only player to have beaten Graf this year. Graf's 39-1 
record would be perfect except for a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 loss to Sabatini in April at 
a tournament in Amelia Island, Fla., which was also played on clay. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who will be 20 four days after the end of the tournament, got a rematch 
with Sabatini last week in Berlin and won, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
If Graf celebrates her birthday with a victory here, she would become only the 
first woman to win three consecutive French Open titles since Hilde Sperling of 
Germany (1935-37). 
</P>
<P>
Tennis notes 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, top-seeded and No. 1 in the world, plays the first match on center 
court today against Camille Benjamin, who lives in Bakersfield. Benjamin is 
ranked No. 88. . . . Ninth-seeded Jimmy Connors follows Graf onto center court 
for his first-round match against Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia. . . . 
Gabriela Sabatini debuts on center court after Connors, against Akemi Nishiya 
of Japan. . . . Jim Pugh of Palos Verdes drew second-seeded Boris Becker for a 
first-round match, which will probably be scheduled for Tuesday. . . . Graf is 
dating 24-year-old fellow West German player, Alexander Mronz. German reporters 
already are having a field day with the news, referring to Mronz as "Mr. Graf."

A'S SQUELCH RUMORS, YANKEES, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of rumors had to be straightened out Sunday in New York. Not the least 
was the one in the New York Post that said Yankee star Don Mattingly risks a 
grave back injury every time he swings the bat. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be a false report, as did the one that said Mark McGwire has 
lost his home run swing and the one that said Ron Hassey has lost the knack of 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
Although he isn't hitting the way he is expected to, Mattingly laughed at the 
story. "I haven't had any day this year when I've played with back pain," 
Mattingly, who was one for four, told the Associated Press. "If you know 
anything about back pain, when you have it, you can't do anything. You don't 
play through that type of pain. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have you believe that I'm off to the hospital after every game and 
they wheel me back in for the next game." 
</P>
<P>
After going nine games without a home run, McGwire hit his 10th, Hassey also 
homered, and the Oakland Athletics beat the Yankees, 4-3, behind Mike Moore 
(6-3) for their first sweep over New York since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the three-game weekend series, Hassey ended an 0-for-25 slump. 
He not only wasn't getting hits, he never even hit the ball hard. 
</P>
<P>
But he is hitting everything hard now. He was five for seven in the series and 
helped hand Clay Parker his first defeat after two wins as a Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," said Hassey, who started his resurgence with a 
homer off Roger Clemens last week. "But I'm drilling everything. For a while, I 
wondered if I would ever get a real hit again." 
</P>
<P>
Moore gave up one earned run and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings and lowered his 
earned-run average to 1.94. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, trying to carry the load in the absence of Jose Canseco, was only four 
for 25 when he homered in the fourth to put the A's ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, shut out by A's pitching in the first two games of the series, 
ended the scoreless string by scoring a run off Moore in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Chicago 5 -- It was probably a good way to close out Exhibition 
Stadium in Toronto. George Bell, who enjoyed hitting there, hit a two-run home 
run in the 10th inning off Bobby Thigpen to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Moseby also hit a two-run home run for the Blue Jays, but he said he 
isn't actually looking forward to playing in the new ballpark. The Sky Dome 
opens when the Blue Jays return home on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 9, Detroit 5 -- The Royals continue to be happy they decided to 
give once-troubled Jim Eisenreich another chance. 
</P>
<P>
The speedy outfielder hit two triples, scored twice and drove in a run at 
Kansas City to enable the Royals to complete a three-game sweep of the Tigers, 
who are 6-4 without Manager Sparky Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't do the Tigers much good that they played their 11th consecutive 
errorless game. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 1, Baltimore 0 -- Joe Carter has built his reputation with the 
Indians as a power hitter. Suddenly, the big slugger has emerged as one of the 
best bunters in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Carter beat out a bunt with two out and Felix Fermin on third in the ninth at 
Cleveland to end the surprising Orioles' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Milacki, in a tight duel with Greg Swindell (5-1), held the Indians, who 
had lost five in a row, to two hits in eight innings. But he walked Fermin to 
open the ninth. Mark Williamson came on with the count 2-and-0 on the next 
batter, who sacrificed. Fermin took third on an infield out. 
</P>
<P>
When Carter fouled off the first pitch, third baseman Craig Worthington took a 
step back. That's all Carter needed. Although he weighs 215 and is 6-foot-3, he 
is four for four on bunts. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 6, Seattle 4 -- The Brewers' Terry Francona has regained his hitting 
stroke and scored the winning run, but the Mariners left Milwaukee claiming 
they were victims of a cheap shot that cost them a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches emptied in the third inning when Billy Spiers threw a hook slide 
into Seattle catcher Dave Valle. Valle had already tagged home to force Spiers 
and was in the process of completing the double play to first when Spiers 
hooked him. 
</P>
<P>
Valle sprained his ankle. He pounded the ground and screamed at Spiers. Nobody 
was hurt in the melee, but Manager Jim Lefebvre of the Mariners charged a cheap 
shot by Spiers. 
</P>
<P>
Francona went four for four and is 17 for 37 in the last 10 games, raising his 
average to .252. Francona, after getting his fourth hit with one out in the 
eighth, scored from first to break a 4-4 tie on Paul Molitor's double. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 8, Minnesota 6 -- The Metrodome has improved the hitting of many 
ballplayers. Not in the least, it has helped Rick Leach of the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Leach singled in the go-ahead run in a six-run ninth that carried the Rangers 
to victory. Leach is 26 for 57 (.456) in the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Bush's home run gave the Twins a 6-2 lead in the eighth. It was the 
Twins' first home run in 62 innings.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LANGSTON SOLID IN DEBUT FOR EXPOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Langston was one of the best pitchers in the American League when he 
worked for the Seattle Mariners, but he often expressed dissatisfaction with 
the way he was treated there, and had requested a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who was acquired by the Montreal Expos Thursday for three pitching 
prospects, made his National League debut Sunday at San Diego, and both he and 
the Expos were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-throwing left-hander, who led the American League in strikeouts three 
times, struck out 12 in eight innings and pitched the Expos to a 10-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who didn't get a chance to hit at Seattle because of the designated 
hitter rule, also showed he knew how to handle a bat. He singled and drove in a 
run in the eighth. In his eight innings, he yielded only four hits and one 
earned run. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like my major league debut," Langston said. "Having been around awhile 
helped block out things. I definitely feel a part of this team already. I was 
afraid I might go out there and get bombed." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos made Langston feel welcome with a fine display of hitting. Tim Raines 
hit a three-run homer in the fifth inning to give him a 6-0 lead. Tim Wallach 
had three doubles and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the offensive explosion will make it a little easier to sign Langston, 
who is eligible to become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Philadelphia 5 -- Even a long hitting slump doesn't prevent 
the Giants from scoring runs when Rick Reuschel pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, 40, became the first nine-game winner in the majors although he 
lasted only 5 1/3 innings and the Giants managed just four hits at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hits was a grand slam by Will Clark in the fourth inning, and from 
then on it was downhill for the right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants matched their hit total by committing four errors, making two of the 
four runs Reuschel (9-2) allowed unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 9, Pittsburgh 2 -- If today wasn't Memorial Day, the Pirates would 
probably have declared it a holiday, anyway, because Glenn Davis finally left 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' first baseman just about destroyed the Pirates' pitching staff over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit a home run in each game to lead Houston to a three-game sweep. His 
three-run homer in the fifth inning in this one gave Mike Scott a 6-2 lead and 
it was a romp. 
</P>
<P>
He hit a two-run homer in the third inning of Friday night's 4-2 victory. 
Saturday, he hit a dramatic two-run home run with two out in the ninth to tie 
the game and the Astros won in the 12th, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has 12 home runs this season, has a lifetime average of .347 against 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (7-3) went a strong six innings to beat the Pirates for the fourth time 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Cincinnati 1 -- Mike Bielecki missed out on his shutout at Chicago, 
but he accomplished his primary goal -- beating the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds had a 5-0 record against the right-hander, but except for the 
hot-hitting Chris Sabo, Bielecki had everyone under control. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki went the distance, giving up seven hits to improve his record to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo, after a brilliant start in 1988 as a rookie, cooled off and didn't hit a 
homer from early July to the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't show much power at the start of this season. But, when he spoiled 
Bielecki's shutout with a homer in the eighth, it gave him four in the last 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Atlanta 3 (tie) -- It rained so hard at St. Louis in the bottom of 
the 10th that the field was unplayable and the game was called. It will be 
replayed in its entirety, but all the statistics count. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero, hitting .360 with men in scoring position, hit a two-run homer 
and a run-scoring single to give the Cardinals a 3-0 lead. DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Milwaukee Bucks traded forward Terry Cummings, their leading scorer each of 
the last five seasons, to the San Antonio Spurs Sunday for guard Alvin 
Robertson, forward Greg Anderson and future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, 28, selected to the National Basketball Assn. All-Star team for the 
second time in his career last season, averaged 22.9 points and 8.1 rebounds, 
but missed most of the Bucks last five playoff games with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-9 Cummings came to the Bucks in 1984 in a trade that sent Marques 
Johnson to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4 Robertson, 27, a three-time NBA All-Star, has averaged 16.2 points per 
game, 5.4 assists and 2.9 steals over his five-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-10 Anderson, 25, a member of the 1988 NBA All-Rookie team, averaged 13.7 
points and 8.2 rebounds last season.

ALASKA LAUNCHES AD DRIVE AS SPILL HURTS TOURISM; 
</P>
<P>
CRUISES, TOURS SUFFER, EVEN THOUGH FAR FROM DAMAGE 
</P>

Not one drop of crude oil has washed up on the beach at the Alaskan resort of 
Waterfall, 850 miles southeast of the disastrous oil spill in Prince William 
Sound. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't make any difference to a group of 30 oil-wary individuals who 
canceled their stay at the $550-a-day resort. "If they are paying that much and 
if there is any indication that something will be wrong, they will cancel," 
said Pete Gherini Jr., managing partner of the resort on heavily forested 
Prince of Wales Island. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill spawned by the tanker Exxon Valdez two months ago not only 
inflicted severe environmental damage but has hurt Alaska's tourism industry as 
well. Last week, the state launched a $4-million campaign, paid for by Exxon 
and featuring the image of Marilyn Monroe, aimed at preventing serious damage 
to the industry and dispelling the notion that all of Alaska has been soaked in 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Alaskans have good reason to be protective of their tourist industry. Tourism 
is the state's third-largest industry, behind oil and commercial fishing. About 
750,000 visitors -- 20% from California -- travel to Alaska each year and spend 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a big year for Alaska," said Rich Skinner, spokesman for Holland 
America Lines-Westours, the state's largest cruise ship operator, which carried 
79,000 passengers in 1988. "And this year, knock on wood, still looks like it 
will be a big year for Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
However, weeks of intense media attention on the spill and unfamiliarity with 
Alaska's geography have triggered cancellations and slowed the pace of bookings 
all over the state, said industry officials. Not surprising, particularly hard 
hit have been companies operating in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hit pretty badly when it started," said Rick Delaney, office manager 
at Quest Charters &amp; Tours, which conducts wildlife tours of the sound, home 
to sea bird rookeries and sea lion colonies. "Our reservations fell to nothing 
for about a month." 
</P>
<P>
A tour last week found no signs of oil, said Delaney, who noted that the group 
spotted about two dozen bald eagles. But reservations are still running behind 
last year and a half-day tour might be scrapped. "It's still pretty bad," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand for Cruises Off 
</P>
<P>
"There have been no cancellations, but bookings are slightly softer than last 
year," said Parveen Hughes, spokeswoman for Admiral Cruises, whose ship, the 
Stardancer, is more than 700 miles away from the spill at its closest point. 
"We feel it's the result of the oil spill." 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents in Los Angeles said also that demand for Alaska cruises is off 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't calling up for Alaska like they did last year," said Bill Miles, 
assistant manager of Cruise Holidays. "A lot of people call up and are asking 
the question, 'Are we going to see where the oil spill happened?' It's hard to 
gauge until you go and see for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Duke Butler, owner of Spur of the Moment Cruises in Culver City, which acts as 
a clearinghouse for unsold cruise tickets, said there are cabins available even 
in usually booked July and August. "All of a sudden, we have been getting much 
more space," said Butler. "This has been quite surprising to us." 
</P>
<P>
Yet tourist officials, while loath to appear insensitive to the environmental 
damage, say the oil spill has been limited to a relatively tiny portion of 
Alaska's coastline and about 20% of the sound itself. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many of the two dozen cruise ships that ply the Alaskan waters 
during the summer don't even come near the area. Those that do traditionally 
have taken a route that has not been damaged with crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
"From the television coverage you would think that the entire state was 
devastated, and that's not true," said Skinner at Holland America Line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Misperceptions 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's very amusing that Fairbanks would ever be affected by the oil 
spill," said Janet Halvarson, director of the local visitor and convention 
bureau, who noted that the city lies 300 miles north and inland from Prince 
William Sound. Nevertheless, some tourists have canceled their trips to the 
area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's such incidents that persuaded the Alaskan tourist industry to take action 
and head off further damage. 
</P>
<P>
"There haven't been a great number of cancellations, and we want to make sure 
it stays that way," said Dana Brockway, executive director of the Alaska 
Visitors Assn., the state's tourist industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the state's $4-million effort will be devoted to a nationwide 
television and print campaign featuring the image of Marilyn Monroe sans her 
beauty mark. "Unless you look long and hard, you probably won't notice her 
beauty mark is missing," reads the print ad. 
</P>
<P>
"Without it, the picture may have changed, but her beauty hasn't," the ad says. 
"The same is true of Alaska. The oil spill may have temporarily changed a small 
part of the picture, but the things you come here to see and do are as 
beautiful as ever." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State-Sponsored Visits 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ad campaign, Gov. Steve Cowper is scheduled to praise the 
state's scenery during appearances in Seattle, New York, Phoenix and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The state is also paying expenses for travel and outdoor sports writers to 
visit the state in hopes that they will carry the message to readers. (The 
Times and many other papers do not allow staff reporters to accept free trips.) 
</P>
<P>
Some tourist businesses have benefited from the spill. John Dolan of Eagle 
Custom Tours in Anchorage has kept busy ferrying Coast Guard and Exxon 
employees to and from Valdez, which has become a tourist attraction itself. 
Vendors on the waterfront hawk T-shirts covered with oil-stained hand prints. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan has also gotten a few calls from tourists who want to see the oil-damaged 
areas of Prince William Sound. "People are kind of strange," said Dolan, but 
"they want to see things like that."

ROUGHER ROAD FOR RVS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER ENJOYING YEARS OF GROWTH, THE INDUSTRY IS PREPARED FOR A SLOWDOWN BUT 
COUNTING ON A REBOUND IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Ron and Marilyn Strong take to the open road to get away from it all, they 
don't necessarily leave everything behind. 
</P>
<P>
Inside their aluminum-clad, 26-foot-long motor home, the Culver City couple 
enjoy the use of a built-in microwave oven and color television during weekend 
jaunts to San Diego and Santa Barbara. The $40,000 coach even has a barbecue 
that flips out from an exterior wall so the Strongs can grill their favorite 
steaks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is roughing it -- smoothly," said Strong, 56, a body shop manager who 
plans to trade up to an even bigger, $54,000 motor home with much more storage. 
</P>
<P>
The Strongs are among the legions of Americans who crisscross the country in 
nearly 8.5 million motor homes and travel trailers. After several years of slow 
but steady growth, the industry is preparing for a decline this year in the 
wake of a possible economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody has been a little leery of a recession," said John DeWolf, 
economist for the Recreational Vehicle Assn., which predicts that recreation 
vehicle shipments will fall off about 6% this year before rebounding in 1990. 
"But they are happy to see the slowdown is not any worse than it is." 
</P>
<P>
News of a slowdown comes after the industry saw sales in 1988 reach their 
highest levels in a decade. In fact, the recreational vehicle division of 
Riverside-based Fleetwood Enterprises, the nation's largest motor home maker, 
reported record-high sales of $1.05 billion for its 1989 fiscal year ended 
April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood, which also makes manufactured housing, is headquartered on a 40-acre 
corporate complex that serves as the nerve center for the company's 10,000 
employees across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The complex is also home to Fleetwood's "skunk works," where designers use 
computers and clay models to create future generations of motor homes. In sheds 
off limits to visitors, full-scale mock-ups of these models are inspected and 
tested again by company executives. Most will never go into production. 
</P>
<P>
To stay in touch with customers, Fleetwood's top managers drive motor homes. 
While driving his Pace Arrow motor home across Michigan in 1985, Fleetwood 
Chairman John C. Crean came up with the idea of boosting storage by adding a 
12-inch-high space between the floor and the vehicle's chassis. The idea lead 
to the creation of the Bounder model, which has proved to be one of the 
company's fastest-growing lines. 
</P>
<P>
Despite popular new models and record sales, Fleetwood's stock price fell 
nearly 10% in one day last month after the company reported sluggish sales of 
travel trailers, which are hitched to trucks or other vehicles. Analysts 
lowered earnings estimates for Fleetwood, which will still see profits grow 
from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers are "being more discretionary about what they are willing to spend on a 
trailer," said James V. Sheldon, marketing director at Fleetwood. But Sheldon 
notes that the more expensive lines of self-propelled motor homes, selling for 
$30,000 and up, are still doing quite well. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, predictions of a slowdown come as motor homes have become more 
expensive and gadget-loaded than ever. Affluent retirees are driving off sales 
lots in $100,000 motor homes complete with videocassette recorders and 
interiors finished with oak, brass and velvet. Some 40-foot homes even boast 
closed-circuit television systems so the driver can get a clear picture of 
what's behind the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not looking for the smallest, most economical motor home," said 
Sheldon of Fleetwood Enterprises. "People want the amenities that they enjoy at 
home. There is not a big motor home that does not contain a microwave." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Have 'Pizazz' 
</P>
<P>
Merv Jones, general sales manager at National RV in Burbank, says customers are 
looking for two main things. "They are looking at a floor plan that works for 
them, and it has to have a little pizazz -- it has to look nice." 
</P>
<P>
And the size of many of these lumbering homes on wheels doesn't faze many 
buyers, despite quirks. "They forget about the height," Sheldon said of novice 
drivers. "You are not taking this through a fast-food drive-through without 
paying dearly." 
</P>
<P>
Once they hit the road, many motor home enthusiasts travel in groups on 
organized outings. The Strongs' Elks Lodge, for example, organized weekend 
trips every month. RV campsites, complete with utility hookups and even 
swimming pools, rent for as little as $7 a night. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent outing to San Diego, the Strongs took shuttle buses from the 
campsite to Tijuana. "It just helps you get away from the hassles," said Don 
Strong of the outings. "It's a break for us." 
</P>
<P>
Although the industry has sought to woo younger buyers, most motor home 
customers tend to be in their 50s and retired. In fact, older customers tend to 
buy the larger and more lavish motor homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The retiree market is still very important," said Les Werkstell, an industry 
analyst at First Manhattan Co. 
</P>
<P>
Younger consumers are "paying off a home or putting kids through school," said 
Sheldon. "The growth will continue to come from retired and semi-retired 
buyers, those empty nesters who are moderately affluent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Tastes 
</P>
<P>
Affluent retirees are less likely to be affected by a rise in interest rates or 
a hike in gasoline prices. "People who spend $50,000 for a motor home don't 
worry about another 20 cents a gallon," Werkstell said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a traditional market with traditional tastes. Although baby boomers might 
have taken to sleek aerodynamic shapes in automobiles, older motor home buyers 
are quite fond of the traditional, boxy motor home. 
</P>
<P>
"The average RV buyer is very conservative," said Sheldon. "We used to have 
swoops and curved backs," he said of some previous models that failed to win 
buyers over. "They want storage and a functional floor plan." 
</P>
<P>
The top-of-the-line, self-propelled motor home has emerged as a top seller 
after the industry suffered a crushing blow in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
when gas shortages and a recession played havoc with sales. Sales dropped from 
an all-time high of more than 441,000 in 1976 to nearly 100,000 four years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bright Future 
</P>
<P>
"The industry got a double whammy," Werkstell said. "They are not back to where 
they were in the late 1970s." Annual sales have stabilized at about 220,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Slow growth makes for stiff competition between the top recreational vehicle 
makers. Fleetwood and its competitors, like No. 2 Winnebago, advertise heavily 
in motor home buying guides and magazines. The companies are almost always 
represented at the nearly 200 RV shows nationwide that begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood, which spends $10 million a year on research and development, has 
even gotten a patent on its design for the Bounder motor home, which has a 
false floor that can dramatically increase the amount of storage space. 
</P>
<P>
Although the industry is looking at a sales downturn this year, the long-term 
future for motor homes is bright. The leading edge of baby boomers, now in 
their early 40s, will eventually approach motor home buying age, said 
Werkstell. "The demographics are very good."

NETWORKING CLUBS: BUSINESS OVER THE EGGS BENEDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When custom furniture maker Ian Walmsley sought to increase his business, he 
didn't advertise in a newspaper or the Yellow Pages. Already dependent on 
word-of-mouth recommendations for his cabinetry and furniture, Walmsley joined 
the Brentwood chapter of LeTip International, a professional networking group 
that meets for breakfast every Thursday at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In two months, he said, he has had a couple of "interesting meetings" and made 
many contacts. "Inevitably, it will lead to something," said Walmsley, who 
works in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Walmsley is one of the thousands of business people aggressively shaking hands 
and passing out business cards in scores of networking clubs throughout 
Southern California and elsewhere. The clubs allow business people to meet 
potential customers and promote their businesses in a social setting. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs are not philanthropic or service-oriented. In fact, LeTip's motto is 
"dollars in your pocket." 
</P>
<P>
LeTip, founded 11 years ago in San Diego, and The Network, started four years 
ago in La Verne, are just two expanding networking groups. There are networking 
clubs for minorities and others for women, such as Women in Business and the 
Leads Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Networking is far from peaking," said Ivan Misner, a management consultant who 
founded The Network. "People aren't going to stop networking because they need 
to network to get business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Share Many Leads 
</P>
<P>
Misner said about 1,700 members belong to 90 Network chapters in five states: 
California, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana and Indiana. Just 3 1/2 years ago, only 
300 members belonged to The Network. Members pay a $50 registration fee and 
monthly dues of about $15. One day a week, at 7 a.m., they meet at a restaurant 
or hotel. The session begins with every member presenting a minute-long 
commercial describing what they do and what kind of business leads they are 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Then, two members give longer talks about their products. Before the meeting 
ends, members and guests swap business cards and referrals. In 1988 alone, 
Misner said, members of The Network shared 63,000 leads. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to get business, you have to give business," Misner said, adding 
that The Network's motto is "givers gain." But he cautioned that networking is 
not a quick fix for ailing businesses because it takes time to establish a 
relationship with other members. 
</P>
<P>
Misner and other founders of The Network said that although there is 
competition for new members among the groups, there is room for many clubs 
because most admit only one member from each profession or specialty. The 
limits are set to improve the odds for the group's one lawyer or one car 
salesman finding new clients or customers. 
</P>
<P>
The early morning meetings are the bane of most networking club members, but, 
they say, they cope with the time. 
</P>
<P>
Every Wednesday night, Linda Watts, a partner in Blasi &amp; Watts Personnel 
Services in Century City, wonders why she is setting her alarm extra early for 
her 7 a.m. LeTip breakfast. "I go because the business referrals have been 
really good, and I've met some great people through the group," Watts said. "I 
was really phobic about speaking to crowds of people, but this has really built 
up my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members Pay Dues 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting in a West Los Angeles office building, about 40 LeTip 
members were smiling, chatting and shaking hands at a furious pace. No one 
wanted to miss shaking hands with everyone there because there was a "mystery 
greeter" at the gathering and those who didn't shake the greeter's hand would 
be fined. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for all the handshaking and card-passing, LeTip members pay $175 a 
year to LeTip International and $25 to the local chapter. They also pay 
breakfast dues of $130 each quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Pomerantz, a Santa Monica dentist who sits on the ethics committee of a 
local dental society, said he joined LeTip because he can meet potential 
patients without advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica nutritional consultant Jennifer Jensen, who made a pitch for 
healthful eating habits that morning, said her LeTip membership has "definitely 
paid for itself." Jensen, a registered dietitian, has built her practice 
through networking and word-of-mouth referrals. "It's hard to get up early, but 
after I go to a LeTip meeting I feel very, very charged up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
David Rose, LeTip of Brentwood's president, said that when he recently asked 
how many members had made money from a tip in the last few weeks, "a sea of 
hands went up" and "it was very rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, a partner in the Santa Monica accounting firm Gumbiner, Savett, Friedman 
&amp; Rose, said his LeTip involvement not only brought his firm new business 
but also helped his clients make valuable connections. 
</P>
<P>
"People turn to their accountant for a great, great deal more than financial 
advice," he said. "Knowing all these people makes me more valuable to my 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasn't a Joiner 
</P>
<P>
Rose says a key to the success of the referral system is motivation. "The 
mechanic will do a great job because he had to come into the room and face us 
every week," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who has been president of the group for about nine months, said he never 
joined organizations before LeTip. "I really am not a joiner," he said. "I 
wasn't active in anything, not in churches or country clubs." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to join LeTip, he said, because he felt that his means of finding 
new business were drying up. Now, he is so happy with the contacts he has made 
through LeTip that he recently joined the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce. "I 
think we can't just do one thing to market ourselves," said Jeanne Paster, a 
Brentwood interior designer who joined LeTip in December. "Besides the 
business, it gives you a community group to connect with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Loyalty 
</P>
<P>
She said she will stay in LeTip at least two years to see how it helps her 
business. "It's an intelligent thing for any independent business person to be 
involved in." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Peterson was a San Diego life insurance broker when he founded LeTip in 
February, 1978. Now he works full time for the organization, which has 100 
clubs in Southern California and Arizona, each with up to 50 members. 
</P>
<P>
"What sets us apart is that we demand the loyalty of the members and require at 
least one tip per person, per week," Peterson said. "We try to get across the 
idea of supporting members of the club and going out of your way to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said LeTip suggests that local clubs kick out members that don't 
produce at least two tips a month for fellow members. The club also sends an 
"inspector" to visit prospective members' businesses to make sure they are not 
operating out of garages or basements. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollars in your pocket -- that's what we are here for. We are not here to play 
games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he likes running LeTip International more than selling life 
insurance. "You help so many people," he said. "I feel like I have helped 
everyone in the room be more successful in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUIDELINES FOR NETWORKING 
</P>
<P>
 Here are The Ten Commandments of Networking, from Ivan Misner's book 
"Networking for Success; How to Become a Notable Networker." 
</P>
<P>
 1. Have the tools to network with you all the time: a name tag, a cardholder 
full of business cards and a card file to carry other people's cards. 
</P>
<P>
2. Set a goal regarding how many people you'll meet, and don't leave until you 
have met your goal. 
</P>
<P>
3. Act like a host, not a guest. 
</P>
<P>
4. Exchange business cards with the people you meet. 
</P>
<P>
5. Listen and ask the five "W" questions -- who, what, where, when and why. A 
notable networker has two ears and one mouth and uses both of them 
proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
6. Write comments on the back of the business cards you collect. This enables 
you to remember the person when you follow up the next day. 
</P>
<P>
7. Give a lead or referral whenever possible. If you freely give business to 
others, they will give business to you. 
</P>
<P>
8. Describe your product or service in 60 seconds. Be specific but brief. 
</P>
<P>
9. Spend 10 minutes or less with each person you meet and don't linger with 
friends or associates. Try not to get caught up in too much idle chatter. 
</P>
<P>
10. Follow up with the people you meet. A simple follow-up letter or telephone 
call can mean the difference in making the time valuable. If you promise to get 
back to someone, do it.

Banks Call Off Merger: Silicon Valley Bancshares and Plaza Commerce Bancorp 
called off a previously reported agreement to merge. The bank holding companies 
said the merger would not have benefited shareholders of either company at this 
time. The proposal, announced last month to merge the Plaza Bank of Commerce of 
San Jose and Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, would have created a strong 
Silicon Valley institution with combined assets of about $752 million.

<P>
3-YEAR CONTRACTS FEATURE CHILD-CARE FUND, FAMILY LEAVE, PROFIT SHARING

<P>
AT&amp;T and its unions agreed Sunday on three-year contracts providing workers 
with wage increases, a new profit sharing plan and an innovative package of 
family benefits, including leaves to care for sick parents and a $5-million 
child-care fund. 
</P>
<P>
Company and union officials said the scope of the "family issues" benefits was 
unprecedented in a major corporate contract. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide agreement came after American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and 
the unions forged a compromise over health insurance shortly before existing 
contracts for about 160,000 workers were to expire at midnight Saturday. That 
development convinced the unions to negotiate past the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts contain limits on AT&amp;T's use of temporary workers, a 12% 
benefits increase for new pensioners, a 5% increase in payments for existing 
pensions effective Jan. 1, 1991, and a system to assist workers seeking 
transfers or looking for work elsewhere in the company when jobs are 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Be Ratified 
</P>
<P>
The unions agreed to amend several job classifications to allow AT&amp;T to 
deploy workers at new tasks because of technological advances and other 
organizational changes. They failed to get AT&amp;T to reinstate cost-of-living 
adjustment clauses into the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Also, AT&amp;T joined with the unions in forming a committee that will lobby 
for legislative and policy changes designed to curb soaring health-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts, the result of the largest single-employer collective bargaining 
this year, are subject to rank-and-file ratification. They likely will have a 
significant impact on contract talks this summer with the "baby bells" formed 
after the 1984 AT&amp;T breakup. 
</P>
<P>
The unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said the health-care compromise complied 
with their pledge to expand medical benefits while not allowing AT&amp;T to 
pass on health-care costs to union workers. That issue was the major hurdle to 
a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The health-plan premiums remain fully paid by the company and the plan retains 
100% coverage for most services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overnight Talks 
</P>
<P>
The talks continued overnight and Sunday to settle local matters such as 
seniority and vacation provisions in some AT&amp;T divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The members of CWA and IBEW can be proud of this settlement," CWA President 
Morton Bahr said. "This proves how successful we can be when we stick together 
and fight together." Added IBEW President John Barry: "We intend to make sure 
that AT&amp;T does excel." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Williams, AT&amp;T's vice president for labor relations and top 
negotiator, called the contract "the most progressive ever negotiated by 
AT&amp;T. It recognizes the needs of AT&amp;T's changing work force and it will 
further strengthen AT&amp;T's competitive thrust and cost-containment as the 
company enters the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The national agreement provides operations employees -- operators, technicians, 
clerical and administrative staff -- an immediate 4% pay increase, an 
additional 2.5% in the second year of the contract and 2.25% in the final year. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing workers would receive an 8% lump-sum payment after ratification 
and those in skilled trades would get an additional 50 cents an hour. All 
manufacturing workers would receive base wage increases of 3.5% in the second 
year of the contract and 3% in the third. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average $700 Payments 
</P>
<P>
The profit sharing plan includes a formula that should yield workers 2.5% of 
company profits payable on March 31 in each contract year. The average payment, 
based on AT&amp;T's 1988 performance, would be $700, the unions said. 
</P>
<P>
The $5-million fund included in the family benefits package will be paid for by 
AT&amp;T and jointly administered to support new and existing child-care 
centers. AT&amp;T also agreed to establish tax-deferred accounts that employees 
can use to save up to $5,000 a year for child or elder care. 
</P>
<P>
The parental and elder-care leave provisions would guarantee a worker's job and 
seniority and provide medical and dental coverage for up to six months. 
AT&amp;T also agreed to pay $2,000 toward the costs of adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the agreement was a new legal plan for employees and an 
infusion of $30 million over the life of the contracts to a company-union 
training and retraining program.

Mortgage Rates Drop: Interest rates on fixed-rate home mortgages averaged 10.5% 
last week, according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. That was down from a rate of 10.69% the previous week. On one-year 
adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 9.18% 
last week, down from 9.28% the week before, the agency said.

Restrictions Put on Singer Co.: The firm has been barred from selling any of 
its assets or paying stock dividends pending a lawsuit about claims that a 
former subsidiary defrauded the government. The company, named as a 
co-defendant in a civil suit against its former Link Flight Simulation 
division, was also ordered not to incur any new debt or make any payments to 
investor Paul A. Bilzerian, the Florida financier who acquired the company last 
year. The preliminary injunction was sought by the Justice Department, which 
last March joined the $231-million lawsuit that had originally been filed by a 
former Link Flight pricing administrator.

THE STARS ARE CARS;

<P>
AUTO MAKERS COMPETE FOR EXPOSURE BUT WON'T LET PRODUCTS BE TV OR FILM 
'VILLAINS' 
</P>

Remember Magnum P.I.'s Ferrari? It was supposed to be a Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Knight Rider's talking Trans Am? It was almost a Datsun Z. 
</P>
<P>
Those are just two of the more notable secrets of one of Los Angeles' 
least-known, but most-fascinating cottage industries -- the job of placing cars 
in front of Hollywood's cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Today, getting an auto maker's cars and trucks exposure on a television show or 
in a feature film has become a big and competitive business. Now, car companies 
have agents for their cars just like actors do, to read scripts and fight for 
roles. The auto makers annually turn over roughly $10 million worth of free 
cars to Hollywood; right now, several hundred cars are sitting on agents' 
parking lots around Los Angeles, available for use by virtually any major 
studio or production company. 
</P>
<P>
For Hollywood, the arrangement saves hundreds of thousands of dollars annually 
in production costs that would otherwise have to be spent on renting or buying 
new cars. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the auto makers' prize is free exposure, at a time when comparable 
advertising time costs a fortune. "It's the type of exposure you can't buy," 
observes Bob Hadler, of Hadler Public Relations, which represents Chrysler and 
Mazda in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Close Tabs on Cars 
</P>
<P>
But car placement was not always such a big deal. Back in the 1960s Detroit's 
auto makers gave the process little thought, and poured free cars into 
Hollywood like water. Often, one auto company would provide an entire fleet for 
free to a studio. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the auto makers had little control over how their cars were used; sometimes 
they didn't know whether the cars would end up in front of the camera -- or in 
the hands of the producer's latest lover. 
</P>
<P>
But no longer. Now Detroit and the German luxury car companies -- the Japanese 
still have only a limited involvement with Hollywood -- keep close tabs on the 
cars they provide for television shows and feature films. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights Retained 
</P>
<P>
"General Motors auditors retain the right to check that the cars are being used 
properly in the movies," notes Eric Dahlquist, head of the Vista Group, an 
agency that represents Oldsmobile, GMC Truck and Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, film makers now are much more selective about the cars they 
display, and in some cases audition two or three before making one a star. 
</P>
<P>
Cementing today's more formal relationship between Hollywood and Detroit are 
the car agents. Now, five Los Angeles-based agencies, working on retainer to 
the major auto companies, dominate the business of turning cars into 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Those firms -- Hadler, Norm Marshall &amp; Associates, the Vista Group, Unique 
Product Placement and Rogers &amp; Cowan -- along with the transportation 
coordinators at the major studios and production companies, form a tightly 
knit, constantly networking community that determines which cars you see on the 
silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
"You become known in the placement field for follow through and service, just 
like any other business," says Dahlquist. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just like actors' agents, we look for a role, and compete against three 
or four other guys," adds Frank Devaney, senior vice president in charge of 
product placement at Rogers &amp; Cowan, which represents Ford. "What brings 
the car into the show is the relationship you have with the production 
company." 
</P>
<P>
The agents also work closely with the studio transportation coordinators to 
determine what their cars can and cannot do once they go before the cameras. 
That's because the car companies are now very wary about what movie people will 
do with their cars. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, most auto makers, mindful of their images, refuse to provide free 
cars to be driven by movie villains. While some are a little flexible -- Rogers 
&amp; Cowan will OK a Ford to be stolen by a bad guy as long as it was 
originally a car belonging to a good guy -- all companies reject drug dealers, 
sex offenders, or other really evil characters. 
</P>
<P>
"There are degrees of bad guys," says Devaney. "I would say no to a drug dealer 
or a kidnaper, and we won't have any rapes in the car. But if a bad guy steals 
the car, why not? It's not his car." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the movies still have truly evil characters, and they drive, too; so 
producers have to buy or rent their wheels instead. 
</P>
<P>
Often movie makers must rely on used cars and rentals for chase scenes and 
stunts as well. 
</P>
<P>
That's because at least since the movie "Smokey and the Bandit" -- which 
featured a souped-up Pontiac Firebird in plenty of chase scenes -- the auto 
makers have become cautious about providing free cars that will be used in any 
reckless driving scenes. Pontiac reportedly was hit with a series of lawsuits 
from parents of teen-agers hurt in accidents after trying to emulate Burt 
Reynolds' driving in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of new cars has also made the auto industry less willing to turn 
over perfectly good cars to be smashed up. In fact, the car companies now 
demand their cars be returned at the end of filming in the same condition that 
the producers got them; any repairs have to be performed at the studios' 
expense. The cars are then resold as used -- often with no one knowing they 
were once in the movies -- through auto dealer auctions. 
</P>
<P>
To keep its cars out of stunts, GM's Chevrolet division has a strict policy 
that none of its products given to a production can be filmed with two or more 
of their wheels off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
GMC Truck, another GM division, did provide pickup trucks for the stunt-laden 
television show "The Fall Guy," but none of the stunts in the show were done 
with free vehicles from GMC. Instead, the producers built a special vehicle -- 
one that looked like a GMC truck -- for many of the show's stunts. 
</P>
<P>
Producers also can't rely on Detroit for classic cars used in period-piece 
movies. Usually, the studios go to rental agencies -- a Budget outlet in 
Beverly Hills and Avon Rental in West Hollywood are popular with transportation 
coordinators -- that carry specialized cars. 
</P>
<P>
But just as the auto makers have become more particular about how their cars 
get used, the competition among auto makers to get their products in front of 
the cameras has reached an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
Today, casting calls for cars are becoming more and more common. 
</P>
<P>
For this summer's James Bond movie, "License to Kill," Bond will forsake his 
beloved Aston Martin for the first time, in favor of a Lincoln Mark VII. But 
Ford won the role only after auditioning against both a Mercedes and a BMW, 
according to Devaney. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, such competition has had a big impact on well-known shows and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
The creators of Knight Rider, the show built around a talking car, originally 
planned to use a Datsun 280Z sports car for the central role. But Dahlquist, 
who then represented Pontiac, happened to live next door to Knight Rider's 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlquist lobbied the producer, telling him about Pontiac's new Trans Am, which 
was about to debut, and showed him pictures of the prototype. The show switched 
to the Trans Am, giving the new car priceless weekly exposure just as it hit 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Still, sometimes car companies drop out of the bidding if they are unsure of a 
show. Tom Selleck ended up in Magnum's famous Ferrari only after Porsche 
refused to cooperate with the show's producers. Before Magnum first aired, the 
show's creators were sold on Porsche, and planned to use a 928 in the first 
season, switching to a new 911 Cabriolet when it came out in time for the 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
But Volkswagen of America, which distributed Porsche cars in the United States 
at the time, balked at the cost of meeting the producers' demand that the car 
be fitted with a special sunroof unavailable on production models. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Magnum's creators rented a Ferrari, and VW and Porsche lived to 
regret it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuse to Pay 
</P>
<P>
Even with the intense competition for exposure, however, the auto makers still 
refuse to pay the studios for the placement of their products. 
</P>
<P>
Agents say only one firm -- Toyota -- has ever paid a fee. The Japanese auto 
maker, which doesn't have a product placement agent, paid a reported $50,000 to 
get its truck a prominent role in "Back to the Future." 
</P>
<P>
For "Back to the Future II," now filming and set for a Christmas release, the 
producers once again sought fees from the car makers. This time Ford and other 
firms were asked to pay to have a futuristic dealership bearing their logo 
featured in the sequel, which is set in the year 2015. 
</P>
<P>
Ford refused to pay, and the dealership eventually went to Pontiac, which is 
also supplying several rare, futuristic-looking concept cars at considerable 
expense. Sheila Main, a Pontiac spokeswoman, refused to say whether Pontiac is 
paying for the dealership spot in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
But car company agents hope that Pontiac didn't pay. "We're holding the line on 
paying the studios," says Norm Marshall, of Norm Marshall &amp; Associates, 
which represents Chevrolet. "They say it's an advertisement, but they can't 
guarantee whether a movie is going to be a hit. We will keep resisting it, 
because once we start paying, we won't be able to stop."

TV EXPOSURE CAN DRIVE A CAR'S SALES HIGHER, FIRMS FIND

<P>
The impact on car sales from movie and television exposure is hard to measure, 
product placement agents say. But occasionally, the car companies get telling 
reminders of Hollywood's selling power. 
</P>
<P>
BMW's American officials found out about it firsthand not long ago, when one of 
their dealers in Virginia called frantically trying to find out what kind of 
BMW Cybill Shepherd drove in "Moonlighting." A customer wanted to buy the exact 
same model, with the same colors and fabric schemes, as a present for his wife. 
BMW had to call Norm Marshall, of Norm Marshall &amp; Associates, its agent in 
Hollywood, to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz also discovered that the television show "Hart to Hart" provided 
priceless exposure for its little-known station wagon, recalls agent Bob Hadler 
of Hadler Public Relations, which then represented Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
Few car buyers knew Mercedes made a wagon until it was on the show. Later, Sue 
Ellen Ewing drove one on "Dallas," and the double-barreled exposure led to a 
sharp jump in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, car companies consciously seek exposure geared to their customer 
base. Hadler, for instance, convinced the creators of "Dallas" that a modern 
and sophisticated Texas oil man would drive a Mercedes. The agent argued that a 
Cadillac convertible with a longhorn hood ornament, originally planned for J. 
R. Ewing, would give the show's top star a dated image that didn't reflect the 
fact that he was an '80s kind of evil genius. Thus J. R. first drove onto the 
set at Southfork Ranch in a Mercedes. JAMES RISEN

Despite the new competition among the auto makers for Hollywood exposure, the 
Japanese remain surprisingly reluctant to get deeply involved in movie product 
placement. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota has not agreed to work with any television or feature film production 
since "Back to the Future." 
</P>
<P>
Honda officials say their firm has never agreed to work on a television show or 
movie, and has no plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan has worked with only two movies recently, including "Blind Date," a 
Bruce Willis film that featured a Nissan 300ZX. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major Japanese auto makers, only Mazda has retained a Hollywood 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Car agents believe that the Japanese don't work with Hollywood because they 
have never had to do much marketing in this country to sell their cars. At the 
same time, agents say, the studios and production companies generally aren't 
interested in small cars, and the Japanese have only recently started selling 
larger models. JAMES RISEN

REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA'S RATING FUELS ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY

<P>
The Australian government is coming under fire from the financial community and 
voters unhappy with an economic policy they fear has gone badly awry. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement Friday by the credit agency Moody's that it might downgrade 
Australia's rating because of concerns about its huge debt load and continuing 
trade deficits could not come at a worse time for the Labor government. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage interest rates of 17%, a direct result of a year-long monetary squeeze 
by Treasurer Paul Keating, have alienated thousands of voters and propelled the 
new-look opposition coalition to a healthy lead in the opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
A series of poor economic figures, which has led to a sharp fall in the 
Australian dollar, is likely to continue the downslide Wednesday when figures 
outlining the country's debt problem are released. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect net foreign debt to rise to more than $75 billion for the first 
time -- equal to $4,700 for every Australian or about 31% of the value of gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
"A . . . concern is the high and growing level of foreign-currency debt which 
makes the country vulnerable to interest rate and exchange rate movements," 
Moody's said in a statement saying it was considering a possible downgrading of 
Australia's Aa1 rating, the second highest granted. 
</P>
<P>
The Moody's announcement lopped another 1.5 cents off the value of the dollar 
in about 90 minutes. The currency, quoted at 74.3 cents over the weekend, will 
come under pressure when Asian markets open today, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's is reviewing about $30 billion of government debt. A downgrading would 
increase the government's costs of borrowing.

When you think of "oldies" acts, you don't usually think of bands that have had 
recent Top 10 and even No. 1 chart hits, as both Chicago and the Beach Boys 
have. Yet on their first tour together since 1975, the two veteran groups are 
both clearly dealing as nostalgia merchants for old fans who want to have fun 
fun fun till their banker takes the Beemer away. 
</P>
<P>
The tour kicked off Saturday at the Pacific Amphitheatre (followed by a 
scheduled date Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl), where individual hour-plus sets 
by both acts were followed by a half-hour dual set that opened with the song 
they recorded together back in '74, "Wishing You Were Here." As the song says, 
they "have a job to do and do it well," even if the job requirements don't 
necessarily include assuaging those who might prefer continued greatness to 
past glories. As a Memory Lane trip, it's an enjoyable evening out, to be sure, 
but discouraging too. 
</P>
<P>
Yet buried like a nugget in the middle of the show was a reason to believe in 
at least one group's future: A three-song mini-set by Brian Wilson actually 
included brand-new material and indicated that, should the Boys return to 
recording his work, their best days might not all be behind them. Wouldn't it 
be nice? 
</P>
<P>
The Beach Boys' opening set included only songs from 1967 or earlier, except 
for the recent singles "Wipeout" (a rap-smothered remake of a '60s song) and 
"Kokomo." A car-song medley even had them reprising outside songs that -- as 
singer Mike Love noted -- are often wrongly identified with the Boys, like 
"Little Old Lady from Pasadena" and "G.T.O." 
</P>
<P>
Singing "God Only Knows" and others from among brother Brian's less novel, more 
classic repertoire, Carl Wilson still has the sweetest voice. But this was 
mostly the Mike Love Show, an amiable surfin' and drivin' revue -- complete 
with dancing girls in bikinis -- that probably isn't all that different at the 
Pacific than it is at the Sands. 
</P>
<P>
For its portion of the show, Chicago evenly alternated classic singles from 
1975 or earlier with far less distinctive hits from 1984 or later. Some bands 
lose their hair, while others lose their horns; Chicago is in the latter camp 
and seems rather schizoid on stage now. The band with horns that performed pop 
classics like "25 or 6 to 4" (led by likable, low-key old hand Robert Lamm) had 
far more personality than the band without them that did anonymous David Foster 
fodder such as "You're Not Alone" (sung by showier recent additions Bill 
Champlin and Jason Scheff). 
</P>
<P>
Coming together toward the close, the two outfits alternated each other's hits 
to much crowd-delighting effect, though some of the vocal collaborations were 
still on the ragged or tentative side on this opening night. Eventually 
"Darlin' " and "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" gave way to "In the 
Midnight Hour" and "Dancing in the Streets" -- Bar Band City. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointingly, original group architect Brian Wilson never did appear on 
stage with his fellow Beach Boys. But he did borrow their backing band for 
three mid-set songs -- "Love and Mercy," one of his most beautiful recordings 
ever, plus two new ones, "Country Feeling" and "In My Car," both of which 
sounded as if they could have been late-'60s hits for the band and at least one 
of which the Boys have been working on in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed all in black, Wilson looked mighty sharp; his vocal notes weren't 
always so, but he was never much of a live performer anyway, and the songs -- 
and in this case, their potential to be crooned by his erstwhile partners -- 
are what matter. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Love asked the crowd how many were over or under 25 (it sounded like a 
75/25% split). To the young 'uns, he said, "We're even happier to see you. 
Seriously." We'll see just how serious he is about the band's future, perhaps, 
by whether the next tour includes some new Wilson gems wedged between all the 
old ones.

About 8,000 commercial radio stations nationwide went silent for 30 seconds 
Friday to kick off the largest simultaneous promotion in the history of radio 
-- a $100-million advertising campaign aimed at highlighting what life would be 
like without radio. At 7:42 a.m. EDT, actor James Earl Jones told listeners 
that "for the next 30 seconds this station and others would like you to imagine 
your life without radio. Imagine if all your days sounded like this. . . . " 
The following 30 seconds were filled with silence. Jones then cut in and said, 
"Thirty seconds seems like a long time, doesn't it? Now think how radio fills 
that silence for you." About 80% of the nation's commercial stations 
participated in the opening stage of theyearlong campaign, the Radio 
Advertising Bureau said. The campaign reportedly represented the first 
industry-wide effort to promote the medium since the first commercial radio 
station signed on in 1922. CLAUDIA PUIG

Next year's Grammy Awards will include separate categories for hard rock and 
heavy metal acts, the sponsoring National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences has announced. The music awards show came under fire this year when 
the combined hard rock/heavy metal award, in its first year, went to 
progressive rock veteran Jethro Tull over favored metal band Metallica. Other 
changes voted in by the NARAS trustees include limited eligibility for new 
single releases of songs from older albums and the broadening of eligibility 
requirements for the best new artist and producer of the year nominations.

The Rev. Jerry Falwell is cutting back on his television schedule. Falwell 
plans to discontinue his daily syndicated show "Pastor's Study" so that he can 
focus his energy on his religious teachings. Spokesman Mark DeMoss said Falwell 
is still deciding other activities to eliminate "that he doesn't deem critical 
or central to what's of utmost importance to him, and that's mainly Thomas Road 
Baptist Church and Liberty University," which are located in Lynchburg, Va. 
Falwell still will have his "Old Time Gospel Hour" on television, but "Pastor's 
Study" was taking too much time, he said, according to wire reports. The show, 
which ran for two years, featured interviews, musical performances and promoted 
the school andchurch. CLAUDIA PUIG

The Doonesbury comic strip goes to China for a week beginning today, and its 
distributor hopes events there in real life don't turn ugly. Officials at 
Universal Press Syndicate of Kansas City, Mo., said a violent clash with 
authorities at the student protests in Beijing could make the strip's humor 
appear unseemly. "We have our fingers crossed," said Lee Salem, editorial 
director at the syndicate, which distributes Doonesbury to 900 cities. 
"Assuming there's not mammoth bloodshed, I think the week (of strips) would 
still hold up," Salem said. "The really troublesome part would come if the army 
would have to resort to violence to remove the students." The students, 
however, are due to cease demonstrating on Tuesday. In the series, Uncle Duke's 
bespectacled assistant, Honey Ching, wanders into the student demonstration in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square and thinks it's her class reunion. Running into an 
old classmate who says, "Reunion? Hee, Hee! Forget it!" Honey replies, "I know! 
You're the only classmate I've actually seen." CLAUDIA PUIG

POP CAPSULES: 'REGGAE SUNSPLASH' FINISHES WITHOUT A SPLASH 
</P>

Talk about a case of skankus interruptus. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel Pulse was building momentum for a triumphant finale to its headlining 
set at the "Reggae Sunsplash" concert at the Greek Theatre on Saturday. But the 
English band abruptly concluded its performance at 8 p.m. sharp -- exactly four 
hours after the first of the weekend's two sold-out shows began. 
</P>
<P>
The audience didn't seem to mind the anticlimactic ending -- there wasn't even 
much of an uproar over the lack of an encore. In fact, Steel Pulse had to vie 
for the audience's attention with a beach ball bouncing around in the crowd and 
the dude scaling a 60-foot light tower. 
</P>
<P>
That was pretty much the tone of the day: The young, racially mixed, 
party-minded crowd was clearly out to enjoy itself at the first event of the 
Greek summer season, whether milling about and dancing in the aisles near the 
stage or strolling out to sample to the T-shirt, crafts and food booths in a 
parking area adjoining the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill were singers Sugar Minott, Half Pint, Sophia George and Marcia 
Griffiths. The "Sunsplash" tour is due at San Diego's Open Air Theatre on 
Thursday and the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on Friday. DON SNOWDEN

POP CAPSULES: REFLECTIVE ROBERTO CARLOS RESISTS CHEST-THUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR VALLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Universal Amphitheatre has developed quite a knack for packing the house by 
booking big-name Latin pop stars, many of the saccharine crooner variety. 
Fortunately, Brazil's Roberto Carlos did much to resist the chest-thumping 
sentimentality and "My Way"-narcissism of his peers during his show there on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos' better love songs transcend mere retelling of the heart's loses. 
Instead, like Garcia Marquez's eternally lovesick Florentino Ariza, Carlos 
invokes a balancing femininity; a sensual and moral ethic for facing life and 
death. His rendition of Gardel's classic tango "Volver," and "Detalles," an 
exceptionally poignant song in which Carlos accompanies his dense, reedy, 
vibrato-less voice on solo guitar, illustrate this deeper side. 
</P>
<P>
His mostly female audience, however, didn't seem ready to accept the 
reflective, older, more domestic fellow Carlos seems to have become. Rabid 
females, soaring over Carlos and his formidably loud 16-piece band, repeatedly 
screamed amorous declarations. He also indulged in some sing-song trifles ("Mis 
Amores"), and the easy moralizing of "Apocalipsis," a slightly acid-rock tune 
condemning abortion, drugs and violence in one breath. VICTOR VALLE

HUNTINGTON ASSEMBLES DRAWINGS OF HISTORIC BRITISH FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Art Gallery's current exhibition, "British Portrait Drawings of 
Notables," takes as its central theme the famous historic individuals in 
European literature, the arts and politics. It offers a modest but often 
delightful look at writers and poets such as Charles Dickens and Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning and such memorable figures as politician William Gladstone and 
adventurer Captain Blood. 
</P>
<P>
Culled by curator Shelley M. Bennett from the Huntington's collection of more 
than 13,000 drawings and watercolors, the exhibit features some of the most 
famous countenances in European history, from Napoleon to Johann Sebastian 
Bach. 
</P>
<P>
Any exhibit of historical portraiture must unfortunately deal with a 
contemporary ignorance of history. Thankfully, this show's descriptive labels 
are more than just title and artist. They are mercifully brief but give a touch 
of history, a hint of social implication and occasionally even a whiff of 
gossip. This kind of concise information adds immeasurably to an appreciation 
of images such as illustrator James Smetham's gaunt and intense pencil 
self-portrait and comic artist Thomas Rowlandson's stinging watercolor of the 
theatrics of actress Sarah Siddons. 
</P>
<P>
The show isn't large, but the history it covers gets further clarification by 
being broken into three small rooms, which feature heads of state, the arts and 
finally notables in politics, the military and the church. Interestingly 
enough, the distinction of social position also shows some of the artistic 
conventions that artists used to express the personality of their subject. 
Poets and artists like Lord Byron appear to glow with an inner fire. 
</P>
<P>
Creativity frequently lights their the faces with near-mystic inspiration as 
they gaze off into infinity with romantic melancholy. But heads of state such 
as King George IV are ripe for lampooning and wily politicians such as William 
Gladstone are engagingly exaggerated into a kind of physical comedy of 
political blunders. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations and commentary aside, the seduction in these portraits lies in the 
fact that these were memorable individuals. After being duly impressed by their 
credentials and the artistic trappings of their positions, we want to feel we 
can know what they were like as people. We try to read their faces, looking 
deeply into their eyes for humor or cruelty. We see in the scholar Johann 
Bodmer's hawklike profile a keen intellect and summon up William Wordsworth's 
mellowness from his relaxed and open gaze. Portraits provide a way to search 
for character and personality. It's a rewarding and timeless venture that makes 
history seem more about people than events. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all the glamour of famous personalities, this exhibit is remarkably 
restrained, tucked away in an upstairs corner of the Huntington mansion like a 
bright, shy child. The images are small and sometimes so pale the viewer must 
look closely to catch the nuances in color and line. But the subtle charms of 
the doe-eyed illustrator Kate Greenaway and the impishness of artist John 
Linnell are worth looking for. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be on view until June 25 in the Changing Exhibitions Rooms. 
The Huntington is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 1 to 4:30 p.m. and on 
Sundays by reservation.

A PERFORMANCE ARTIST WITH A NATURAL INSTINCT TO SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long way from tiny town Michigan to New York's East Village, but Holly 
Hughes has taken the trek as easily and as irreverently as she mixes travesty 
and social comment in her plays. 
</P>
<P>
After majoring in art in college and a furtive try at a career as a painter, 
Hughes discovered play writing in the early '80s while hanging out at the WOW 
Cafe, New York's premier bastion of feminist theater. 
</P>
<P>
Rebelling against a conservative, upper-middle-class upbringing, doing the 
shocking thing came almost naturally for Hughes. Bashing traditional and 
feminist dogmas alike, her theater combines the outre with the poetic. So bold 
are these riffs -- with titles you can't print in a family newspaper -- that 
Hughes has even had trouble getting actresses to play the roles. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's pure pornography and that it'll ruin their careers," she says, 
only half in jest. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old playwright will perform her "World Without End" Thursday and 
Friday and June 8-9 as part of Highways' monthlong "Ecce Lesbo/Ecce Homo" 
festival celebrating Gay Pride Month. 
</P>
<P>
Like fellow monologuists Spalding Gray and David Cale (among others), Hughes' 
solo is fictionalized autobiography. "I'm performing some version of Holly, 
maybe an improved version," Hughes says. "You can always improve on reality 
through art." 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike Gray, Hughes specializes in ribald iconoclasm and what Village 
Voice critic Cindy Carr has called "dyke noir" theater. Like the late Charles 
Ludlam, Hughes uses humor as a leveling device and trashy gags as a crowbar to 
open the door for activism. 
</P>
<P>
"Ludlam had a wide range of emotion within the style of camp, rather than just 
being decorative," she says. "There are campy elements in my work and a humor 
that's John Waters-esque in its love-hate relationship with popular culture and 
trash." 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes also has a serious agenda. "I implicate both myself and the 
audience," she says, "asking questions like what it means to be a good mother 
in the context of a culture that is fundamentally misogynist." 
</P>
<P>
That fear is central to the story she tells, which is inspired in part by her 
own mother's "rather unconventional" telling of the facts of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are punished because they're assumed to have a certain kind of power," 
Hughes says, still on the subject of repression. "But in fact, they're 
relatively powerless." 
</P>
<P>
That lack of power, Hughes says, comes from a paradox that has faced women 
since before her mother's generation. Women are revered as mothers and yet 
denied the chance to define themselves as anything but that. 
</P>
<P>
"World Without End" was also influenced by Hughes' having overheard "two black 
men sitting on a city bus talking about how white people were killing them." 
</P>
<P>
"One guy was going on about how white people hate (blacks) so much they don't 
even know they're doing it. I draw parallels between racism and sexism, 
especially now that we're in this alleged post-feminist generation, it's again 
become unchic for women to express their anger or to ask the world to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in ambiguity. Just asking a question like 'Is someone a good 
mother?' becomes extraordinarily complex. That level of complexity in the way I 
present the stories and the people in them makes people uncomfortable. I don't 
necessarily say this is a good thing or not." 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes isn't content to tear down ways of thinking without offering 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to match the horrific images (presented in her monologue) with some that 
are transcendent," she says. "One of the difficulties of life is trying to 
assess a situation." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, though, critics haven't been as circumspect in their analysis as 
Hughes herself. "Even though there are strong women performers and writers out 
there, when someone wants to praise (you) they'll compare you to Sam Shepard 
and not to Irene Fornes or Caryl Churchill," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's legitimizing because of the culture to be compared to a man -- especially 
a straight, white man. It's not just male critics, either. There's some filter 
-- an unconscious sexism -- that all of us have. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though her style of delivery is completely different, you'd think that 
(monologuist) Karen Finley would be an obvious comparison because what we're 
talking about is similar, but nobody's made that comparison," she says. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Hughes and Finley certainly share is the ability to shake people up. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably no one gets through ("World Without End") without thinking, 'I wish 
she hadn't gone off into that area' -- whether their judgments are based on 
aesthetics or content. There's something to offend just about everyone."

BIKING HAS CAUGHT ON FAST IN ORANGE COUNTY, AND THE BOOM IS TURNING INTO AN

It all seemed so innocent at first. Dan Gladney was just looking for a way to 
stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Gee, this looks like a lot of fun,' " he recalled. "Buy a bike, a 
helmet, and you're set." 
</P>
<P>
If only things were so easy. 
</P>
<P>
Just a year after he went out and spent $350 on a new bicycle ("I thought that 
was a lot of money at the time") Gladney recently "upgraded" to an aluminum 
bicycle in the $2,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly rides of the past have given way to daily outings at 5 a.m., and the 
20-mile excursions that once seemed so challenging are now hardly enough to 
work up a sweat. And the helmet? Gladney now has two of them, plus multiple 
pairs of Lycra bike shorts, jerseys, riding gloves, two pairs of specially 
fitted shoes, gloves and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Well yes, I guess I'm a little obsessed," said Gladney, 36, a zone director of 
sales for the Kendall Health Care Products Co. and a resident of Mission Viejo. 
"But it's just so . . . fun." 
</P>
<P>
Gladney is not alone, and in fact is part of a bicycling boom that has swept 
across Southern California and turned the sport into a passion for tens of 
thousands of riders. 
</P>
<P>
There are few places where biking has caught on as fast as in Orange County, 
where cycling has become a million-dollar industry and bike stores have become 
as prominent as yogurt shops. And with summer, the boom has turned into an 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Drive down any Orange County road this summer and you're likely to see them -- 
some alone, others riding in packs -- their bodies bent over the frames, heads 
low in the wind, legs spinning, their bright yellow, blue and red jerseys and 
helmets announcing the presence of the serious bicyclist. 
</P>
<P>
With miles of bike trails leading to both the beaches and the hills, local 
enthusiasts see Orange County as one of the finest places in the country to 
practice their sport year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is a bad time to ride around here," said KarroLynn 
Wells, membership director for the Orange County Wheelmen, a cycling club 
boasting more than 900 members. "Sometimes it gets hot, and if it rains it can 
get really cold. But that's not often." 
</P>
<P>
Biking, however, just isn't what it used to be. Blame it on the 1984 Olympics, 
when the cycling competition was held in Mission Viejo, but the entire industry 
has gone big-time and high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
No longer content with a leisurely ride down the street, the packs of bikers 
you see on the streets take their sport seriously. Every little detail of the 
bike, from the frame to the spokes to the seat post, gets close attention. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when a handful of U.S. bike manufacturers dominated the 
market, and a top-quality bike went for several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Entry-level sport, touring and racing bikes now start around $250 and go into 
the thousands. There are dozens of brands, a bewildering selection of gear and 
brake systems, wheels and tires. Even the frame has to be carefully selected: 
traditional steel, light-weight aluminum or perhaps the new-age composite or 
carbon fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"For the person who doesn't know much about bikes it can be a little 
confusing," said Jessie Gascon, co-owner of Bicycle Man of Mission Viejo, who 
logs between 150 and 200 miles a week himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to bring them up to date because the technology has changed so 
much in the last 5 years. It's like comparing a Ford Pinto with a Thunderbird 
now; things have changed so much. It's a whole new world out there." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Jones, general manager of Two Wheel Transit Authority in Fountain Valley, 
agreed that the dizzying array of choices on new bikes leaves many people lost. 
But when they get into it, they do so in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't need a $1,000 bicycle when a $300 one will do fine," he 
said. "And then there are people who want a pro bike because it's the 'in' 
thing to do. They just want to have one. It can get addictive." 
</P>
<P>
Small bike-shop owners like Gascon, as well as the larger dealers like Two 
Wheel, report the biggest growth in the bike industry has been in off-road 
mountain bikes with raised handlebars and larger, knobby tires. 
</P>
<P>
"Fat tire" enthusiasts now account for an estimated 60% to 70% of all bike 
sales in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people enjoy getting out of the traffic and back in the hills with 
nature," said Two Wheel's Jones. "And mountain bikes are great on the road too. 
A lot of people who buy the mountain bikes don't even take them off the road." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of the gadgetry and the lure of owning a hand-made Italian racing bike, 
what attracts people to the sport and keeps them in it is the simple fact that 
it is a relatively easy way to stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"People who live around here and don't bicycle, are really missing it," said 
Dan Gilchrist, events coordinator at Two Wheel Transit Authority. "It really is 
wonderful. You can commute on this, you can get fit, you can travel, you can go 
to the market, you can take a vacation and you can always find good camaraderie 
out there on the road. If you don't bike in Orange County, you're missing out."

4 PATRONS INJURED AS GUNMEN OPEN FIRE IN BILLIARD HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES and NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vinh Pham was playing billiards Saturday night at the Kien Giang Billiard hall 
in Orange when the two men with guns walked in. 
</P>
<P>
"One held a gun up and pointed it at us, and said, 'Move,' " recalled Pham, 23, 
who was among more than 20 patrons in the hall just off busy West Chapman 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the two gunmen robbed one man of $700, started pistol-whipping 
patrons and then opened fire into the crowd, injuring four men, two of them 
seriously, according to police and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the injured were treated and released at area hospitals, and two 
remained hospitalized. Both are expected to recover from their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident did not appear to be gang- or race-motivated. "As far 
as we're concerned, it's just another robbery," Orange Police Sgt. John Richard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are not sure what prompted the gunmen to start shooting. Pham said he 
thinks that the men, who were not Vietnamese, may have gotten skittish when two 
customers entered the billiard hall during the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Pham said that one of the gunmen also became irritated after patrons ignored 
his order to move to a wall, struck Pham in the back of the head and then 
pistol-whipped another customer before both men started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Pham, who spent Sunday at the billiard hall nursing a bump on his head, said 
that the first gunman seemed irritated. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept shouting, 'I said, MOVE, man!' And we all started to walk toward the 
back," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
But as Pham joined the others, the first gunman walked toward him, lifted his 
handgun and struck him in the back of the head, toppling Pham to the floor 
beneath a billiard table. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I stayed. I was scared," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber moved to another customer and pistol-whipped him, battering him 
enough that he required hospital treatment, Orange Police Sgt. Bob Gustafson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the customers were huddled together, both men began firing in rapid 
succession, shooting at least six times, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, bullet holes were evident near a rear office table and along the 
wall where a bullet ripped into wood paneling. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery is the first time that an incident involving a shooting has 
occurred at the billiard hall, which has been open 2 years, said manager Vo 
Lap, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Lap, who was not working Saturday night, said the hall is owned by an older 
brother who was out of town on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The hall, which has about 10 tables, is in the rear of a small shopping mall 
adjacent to a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor who was in her house Saturday at the time of the attack said she 
heard about seven "very fast popping noises" but thought they were fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Injured were Asari Mohamed, 20, with a gunshot wound to the back; Hoa Danh, 25, 
gunshot wound to the hand; Hung Manh Lee, 18, gunshot wound to the right 
shoulder, and a 17-year-old juvenile, gunshot wound to the right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was listed in good condition at UCI Medical Center. Danh was listed in good 
condition at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Mohamed and the unidentified juvenile were both treated and released from area 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Another customer, Umo Hossen, 21, who was struck in the head with a gun barrel, 
was treated and released from Western Medical Center in Santa Ana.

<P>
MAN, 67, STRICKEN WHILE WINDSURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 67-year-old man who apparently suffered a heart attack while windsurfing was 
rescued Saturday by four men who saw him fall unconscious into Newport Bay, 
Newport Beach Sgt. Pat O'Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Jack Schwarze of Costa Mesa, was reported in critical condition 
Sunday at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
According to O'Sullivan, Schwarze was windsurfing when he fell unconscious into 
the bay near 18th Street. Four men -- Peter Giacobbo, 50, of Villa Park; John 
Jeffries, 25, of Santa Ana; Deryn Modoff, 24, of Irvine, and Terry O'Shea, 31, 
of Newport Beach, pulled him ashore. Another person summoned two police 
officers, who administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics 
arrived, O'Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan said the bystanders and the police officers who administered CPR 
should be commended for their quick action.

CHAPMAN EXPANSION ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $23-million Chapman College building expansion plan was announced Sunday 
during commencement exercises at the pastoral campus in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
George L. Argyros, chairman of Chapman's board of trustees, said three 
multistory buildings have been approved: a student residence hall, an academic 
hall and a campus center. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the buildings planned is the campus center, at an estimated cost 
of $8.5 million. It will have dining facilities for 1,200 resident students and 
1,200 commuters, faculty and staff. That building might also house social and 
meeting rooms -- mostly for students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James L. Doti, acting president of Chapman, said successful development of 
faculty and of endowments in the past decade have built the foundation for the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The college has secured $8.5 million in gifts and pledges and is hoping for $10 
million more in this category, Doti said. He said the college is seeking an 
additional $4.5 million from other sources.

CLASS OF '39 RELIVES POMP, CIRCUMSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helen Waters Bamber zipped up the flowing black gown, then adjusted her 
mortarboard. 
</P>
<P>
Its silk tassel hung limply over her left ear. But, she wondered, inspecting 
herself in the mirror, was it supposed to hang to the right? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday. Graduation Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bamber and 22 of her classmates had crowded into a conference room at Chapman 
College's Memorial Hall to dress for commencement. 
</P>
<P>
From their nervous chatter ("This robe is hot!" "What do I do with the 
tassel?") they sounded like typical graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
But Bamber and many of her classmates were 71 years old. Several were 
accompanied by their grandchildren. And all had originally graduated from 
Chapman in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as part of their 50th reunion, they had met at the liberal arts college in 
Orange to "re-graduate" -- to march in Chapman's commencement and accept from 
college President James L. Doti a certificate that proclaimed them members of 
the "50 Year Club." 
</P>
<P>
Bamber called Sunday's experience a little scary -- although "not quite as 
scary as the first time." 
</P>
<P>
"It's also a happy occasion," she said. "A time to renew old friendships. 
That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
Agreed Helen Mills Jenkins, another '39er: "This is great. I'm just happy to 
have lived long enough to go through this." 
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday under pure blue skies, the class of '39 marched across Chapman's 
Sunken Lawn to accept their certificates. Graduating with them were 131 
students who received master's degrees and 310 who earned bachelor's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman awarded an honorary degree, doctor of human letters, to film director 
Frank Capra. His grandson, Frank Capra III, accepted the degree on his 
grandfather's behalf. English major Christie Price won the school's highest 
award, the Cheverton Trophy, and presented the student address. 
</P>
<P>
In baccalaureate ceremonies held just before commencement, Dr. James I. 
Spainhowever, president of the division of higher education for the Christian 
Church (Disciples of Christ), gave an address entitled "Don't Worry, Be Happy." 
And Andrea L. Van de Kamp, president of the Independent Colleges of Southern 
California, gave a commencement address entitled "Pushing Back Horizons." 
</P>
<P>
The Class of '39, meanwhile, was concentrating less on horizons than on the 
good times past. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was very different in the old days -- a small Christian school of 200 
students located on the outskirts of Hollywood, the '39ers said. 
</P>
<P>
When they started college during the Depression, nearly every student had to 
work part time to afford Chapman's tuition -- $175 a year -- remembered Donald 
C. Bridgman, a retired educator from Laguna Hills and president of the class of 
'39. 
</P>
<P>
"We were Depression kids," Bridgman said, and the Depression shaped their 
lives. "We didn't produce lawyers, engineers. We were teachers, social workers, 
ministers, professional church workers . . . members of the 'helping 
profession.' " 
</P>
<P>
Retired schoolteacher Margaret Goodwall Silva agreed. "The college was 
dedicated to service of others," she said. "The emphasis was not on money." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, "we had a marvelous time," Silva said. "There weren't any 
panty raids but there were pranks; on special occasions, someone would get in 
your room and pull everything out of the drawers. . . . And the fellows would 
serenade us at night." 
</P>
<P>
An imposing woman named Freda Hatsfield ruled the girls' dorm, maintaining a 
10:30 p.m. curfew and "guarding the virtue of our ladies," Bridgman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt that was unfair," interrupted classmate Janet Parker. "The boys 
didn't have any restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
But according to Silva, the curfew didn't really cramp a girl's style. "Some of 
us broke a good many rules," she said with a smile. "But we all managed." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was a fine little college, said Los Angeles chiropractor Armour 
Guyer, who commuted to Chapman from his home in Silver Lake in a Ford Model A. 
Guyer said he always liked Chapman for "the small classes, the good 
professors." 
</P>
<P>
Although Chapman is bigger and more expensive now -- about 2,400 students are 
enrolled, paying tuition of $11,200 a year -- Guyer said he's still very proud 
of his alma mater. "I come out here quite a bit -- to hear the economic 
forecast talks. You get more value from a small college than a big university 
like University of Southern California or (University of) Michigan. You don't 
have that lost feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Guyer said, "it's nice to be graduating a second time." 
</P>
<P>
Bridgman agreed. "It's great that the college acknowledges us after all these 
years," he said. "This is the ultimate in recycling."

BUSINESS AND PERSONAL FILINGS HAVE DOUBLED SINCE 1980 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County boasts one of the most vigorous small business climates in the 
nation, but it also is one of the most volatile, with thousands of companies 
closing their doors each year. 
</P>
<P>
Many die quiet deaths, but a growing number are using the liberalized federal 
bankruptcy laws to either liquidate their assets or gain protection from 
creditors while they try to reorganize their finances and remain viable 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the number of bankruptcy actions filed in Orange County each year 
has more than doubled from 3,776 to 7,784 last year. Most of those were Chapter 
7 liquidations, according to Michael Rotberg, newly appointed director of 
research and development for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's Central District, 
which covers Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
And the number of Chapter 11 business reorganizations, the most complex and 
costly type of bankruptcy action, more than quadrupled from 90 in 1980 to 384 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the entire Central District, said Rotberg, there were 50,533 bankruptcy 
actions filed in 1988, including 39,665 Chapter 7 liquidations, 1,358 Chapter 
11 business reorganizations and 9,510 Chapter 13 personal reorganizations. 
</P>
<P>
Bernadine Gordon, division manager for the Central District branch in Santa 
Ana, said the caseload has increased so much in the past few years that a third 
bankruptcy judge was named for Orange County in December. 
</P>
<P>
One consequence of the growth in bankruptcy filings is that an increasingly 
large number of Southland firms are finding themselves in the unaccustomed 
position of being a creditor to a bankrupt business. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking case involved the Chapter 11 filing last month of American 
Continental Corp., owner of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Although American Continental is headquartered in Phoenix and filed its 
bankruptcy petition there, it had aggressively marketed its corporate IOUs -- 
called subordinated debentures -- to customers of the S&amp;L.

When the bankruptcy papers were filed, it was revealed that about 22,000 
individuals -- most of them from Southern California and many of them elderly 
people who had invested their retirement funds -- had become creditors in the 
bankruptcy action. They are owed an estimated $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
But there are lots of other individuals and companies in Orange County that are 
being caught in the unfamiliar web of bankruptcy proceedings as their customers 
go under and they are forced to queue up in the creditors' line. 
</P>
<P>
In part, bankruptcy filings are increasing because going broke has evolved from 
a mark of failure to a sign of aggressiveness and entrepreneurial zeal, and no 
longer is something to be ashamed of, said David Krajanowski, a partner in the 
regional accounting firm of Singer, Lewak, Greenbaum &amp; Goldstein. The Santa 
Ana-based CPA firm does a lot of work with faltering businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of bankruptcies has just absolutely, greatly increased over the 
past 5 years," Krajanowski said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big problems nationally "is that we have a lot of dreadfully managed 
companies," said said John C. Boland, publisher of Bankruptcy Values, a 
Baltimore-based newsletter that tracks the investment value of public companies 
that are in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest cause of the surge in bankruptcy activities was the 1978 
overhaul of the federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The changes transformed the much-amended federal Bankruptcy Act of 1898 into a 
modernized, streamlined U.S. Bankruptcy Code that took effect in October, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"The code folded all the various procedures for reorganization into Chapter 11, 
for example. It streamlined and modernized everything," said Marc J. Winthrop, 
a bankruptcy attorney in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
To most laymen, a business bankruptcy means liquidation -- shutting the doors 
for good. That is what happens in most cases, especially with smaller 
businesses that really have no other options than closing down. Of the 7,784 
bankruptcies filed in Orange County last year, 6,138 were Chapter 7 actions. 
</P>
<P>
But bigger businesses, those with lots of assets or a solid customer base, tend 
to look to the bankruptcy courts to help protect and shepherd them through a 
rebuilding or reorganization in the Chapter 11 process. 
</P>
<P>
A Chapter 7 action, according to Winthrop, is no longer useful to most larger 
businesses because the Bankruptcy Code does not allow a corporation or 
partnership to obtain forgiveness of all debt through a liquidation, although 
an individual or a sole proprietor can. 
</P>
<P>
A third common type of bankruptcy action, the Chapter 13, is the consumer's 
version of the Chapter 11 -- a debt reorganization for wage earners whose 
unsecured debts do not exceed $100,000 and whose secured debts do not exceed 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
In all cases, the filing of a bankruptcy petition stops litigation and 
foreclosure actions and any other efforts by creditors to obtain money or 
property from the debtor. 
</P>
<P>
In a Chapter 11, filing the petition enables the debtor to continue operating 
the business while putting together a plan for financial rehabilitation and 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
A Chapter 11 action also allows the business to shed poor or unprofitable 
contracts and leases while assuming profitable contracts and favorable leases, 
even if they had defaulted on them before filing the petition, Winthrop said. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, filing a Chapter 11 gives a company the ability to raise money 
from unusual sources. A business in Chapter 11 can borrow money secured by a 
new first lien on property that already has a first lien on it.

Q&amp;A MARC WINTHROP: THE PATH TO LEGAL BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
DEPENDING ON CREDITORS, IT CAN BE LONG, INTRICATE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Businesses, like the people who run them, have their ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, companies that are really on the way down often turn to the 
bankruptcy courts for relief. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, lawyers like Marc J. Winthrop go to work. 
</P>
<P>
Winthrop is a partner in Lobel, Winthrop &amp; Broker, one of the county's 
major insolvency law firms, formed only 30 months ago in an amicable breaking 
away from McKittrick, Jackson, Demarco &amp; Peckenpaugh in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Now, ensconced in brand-new offices on the 11th floor of the black-glass 
Brinderson Towers building in Irvine, Lobel, Winthrop &amp; Broker, with 17 
attorneys, is handling several dozen cases -- of which more than a dozen, 
including Maui &amp; Sons, Irvine Ranch Markets and Heidi's Frogen Yozurt, are 
considered major Chapter 11 reorganizations. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Winthrop and his partners and associates shepherd clients 
through the bankruptcy courts. Winthrop looks at the process as the legal 
equivalent of major surgery -- an often painful process that uses drastic 
measures to rescue patients from life-threatening ailments. It is something the 
40-year-old attorney has been doing since graduation from UCLA law school 15 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of American Continental 
Corp. -- an action that left tens of thousands of Southern Californians holding 
$200 million worth of ACC bonds and wondering about their rights under 
bankruptcy law -- Times staff writer John O'Dell recently discussed the 
workings of the Chapter 11 reorganization process with Winthrop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the classes and priorities of creditors in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization? 
</P>
<P>
A. At the top is a secured creditor who can look to a particular asset, like a 
piece of machinery or real estate, to satisfy a claim. Then there are several 
classes of priority creditors -- administrative, for professional fees, rent to 
landlords and goods and services acquired during the life of the bankruptcy 
case; gap claims that arise between the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy 
procedure and the granting of the order that puts the company into Chapter 11; 
employee wage claims of $2,000 or less incurred within the 90 days prior to the 
filing of the petition or the cessation of the debtor's business; claims for 
contributions to employee benefit plans, with similar limitations; consumer 
deposits against the purchase of goods and services, to a maximum of $900, and 
finally, taxes owed to government entities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where do the unsecured creditors come in? 
</P>
<P>
A. At the bottom, after the priority creditors, come the general unsecured 
claims for just about anything -- suppliers, unsecured lenders, bondholders, 
debentures holders, providers of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
Q. While you can file for bankruptcy on your own or be forced into it by your 
creditors, you are not actually bankrupt until the court orders it, correct? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not quite. When you file your own petition, that is considered proof of 
bankruptcy, and you are in -- unless a creditor or other interested party 
successfully challenges you. But if creditors are trying to force a company 
into bankruptcy, then there is a screening by the court. In an involuntary 
proceeding, you are an alleged debtor and the court ultimately holds a trial to 
determine whether or not you ought to be in Chapter 11 or Chapter 7. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Once you are in, is it easy to get out? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. The cliche is that bankruptcy is a bell that's very hard to unring. You 
can voluntarily enter, but you cannot voluntarily exit. To get out before the 
process is completed takes a court hearing at which all your creditors and 
other parties with an interest in the proceedings can testify. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are bankruptcies almost always filed because the company has more debt than 
it can manage? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are as many reasons for filing for bankruptcy as there are companies. 
Undercapitalization of an operating company is one -- you have a lot of orders 
for widgets but you can't afford the raw materials to make them. Other big 
reasons are mismanagement and catastrophic events like judgments in product 
liability or patent infringement lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Given that just about anyone can file for Chapter 11, how much abuse is 
there in the system? How often are bankruptcies filed for reasons that have 
little to do with debt repayment problems? 
</P>
<P>
A. To a certain extent, abuse is in the mind of the abused. There probably are 
some who believe that all bankruptcies are frauds . . . (and) want to bring 
back debtor prison. Certainly there are some abuses of the system, but it is 
more often at the consumer level than with corporate reorganization. The abuses 
we see are things like consumers trying to stop evictions or foreclosures by 
transferring the property from one person to another and then filing bankruptcy 
petitions to get the automatic protection from foreclosure while the court 
takes weeks or months to find the case and kick it out. At the corporate level, 
the most typical (abuse) is the transfer of assets from one company to another 
on the eve of a filing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I raised the issue because of allegations in the American Continental Corp. 
case that the real reason Chapter 11 petitions were filed for the company and 
11 subsidiaries of its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. was to shield assets 
from federal control when the S&amp;L was seized. 
</P>
<P>
A. There are a large number of proceedings filed each year in which the real 
issue is not a company's ability to service its debt but where there is a real 
and appropriate concern by the company to conserve its value as a going concern 
and to be able to rehabilitate itself. Quite often we see real estate company 
filings where the assets exceed the liabilities, but it still is appropriate if 
the purpose of the reorganization is to obtain time to recognize the fair value 
of the property. The fact that there is a strategy involved in a bankruptcy 
filing does not necessarily imply that there is a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But is there room in the system for fraudulent filings, or do they pretty 
much get caught and kicked out? 
</P>
<P>
A. The system doesn't catch everything because it can't. The function of 
determining the viability of a bankruptcy claim, for example, has largely been 
taken away from bankruptcy judges and shifted to the Office of the U.S. 
Trustee, which was formed in 1979 to perform oversight and monitoring functions 
and assume many of the administrative duties then held by the bankruptcy 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you establish that you are a creditor in a bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
A. In a Chapter 11, the debtor is required to file schedules of assets and 
liabilities and a statement of affairs within 15 days (of the case filing). 
This must list all liabilities, including unsecured debt. If a creditor is 
listed and agrees with the amount of debt listed, and there is no notation that 
the debt is disputed, contingent or unliquidated, then that creditor need do 
nothing further. The claim is deemed allowed and is taken care of in the course 
of the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if you are not listed on the schedule of liabilities but believe you 
should be? 
</P>
<P>
A. If a creditor is not listed, or doesn't agree with the amount of debt shown, 
or is denoted as being unliquidated, disputed or contingent, then it is 
incumbent on that creditor to file what is known as a proof of claim. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You just send a letter to the court? 
</P>
<P>
A. Don't send a letter. Get the appropriate form from the bankruptcy court or 
the legal forms department at you local stationery store. It is called a proof 
of claim. You fill it out, attach appropriate documentation of your claim and 
file it with the court. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And then the court decides whether you should be added to the list? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. You are automatically put on the claims docket. Once you file a claim, 
it is deemed allowed unless and until the debtor objects to it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How active can a creditor be, or expect to be, in a Chapter 11 proceeding? 
</P>
<P>
A. A small creditor hasn't got much to do but sit and wait and monitor the 
proceedings. The 20 largest unsecured creditors, however, get invited to meet 
and are asked to serve on a creditors committee. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So that committee is only for the largest creditors? 
</P>
<P>
A. In theory, it is made up of the seven largest creditors who are willing to 
serve. But it can be as small as three or big as 12. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can a large group of small creditors -- like a company's individual bond and 
debenture holders -- get together, form an association and then claim 
membership on the creditors committee because, as a group, they are one of the 
largest creditors? 
</P>
<P>
A. I've never seen it happen. But the creditors committee is supposed to be 
representative of the types of claims in the case, and the U.S. Trustee doesn't 
have to put only the largest creditors on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What goes into a company's reorganization plan in a Chapter 11 proceeding? 
</P>
<P>
A. For operating businesses, the classic plan is an internal one in which the 
company can operate and make a profit to fund the plan. There also is an 
external plan, which requires an infusion of capital from the outside, from a 
new investor or new lender or the sale of the company or some of its parts. 
Sometimes, Chapter 11s are filed just to facilitate the sale of a company or 
some of its assets. That happens when a company is in bad shape with suits and 
attachments and creditors hanging all over it so that nobody in their right 
mind would buy it and rely on the owners' representations and warranties that 
all debts and suits been disclosed. If you put it in Chapter 11, the court has 
extraordinary power to sell assets free and clear of liens. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the reorganization plan discuss how creditors are to be paid? 
</P>
<P>
A. Once you have decided on an internal or external plan, then you deal with 
restructuring of debt. There are composition plans, in which you propose to pay 
less than 100 cents on the dollar, extension plans that extend the debt 
repayment over time, equity conversion plans in which creditors get stock in 
the company for their debt, or a combination of extension and composition, or 
even all three, so you propose to pay less than 100 cents on the dollar, plus 
stock, over a period of time. The type of payment is limited only by the 
creativity of counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the court's guidelines in acting on a plan of reorganization? 
</P>
<P>
A. The two basic standards are the best interests of the creditors and the 
feasibility of the plan. The court wants to ensure that the creditors are 
getting more than they would receive through liquidation and that the debtor 
isn't promising more than it can deliver. It is one thing to say you are going 
to repay 100 cents on the dollar, but can you really do it? 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the reorganization plan developed by the company and its creditors 
together? 
</P>
<P>
A. Ideally, they work in conjunction. But it can be done by one or the other. 
One of the common misconceptions about Chapter 11 bankruptcy is that there is a 
120-day limit on filing the reorganization plan. Actually, there is no time 
limit. But the debtor has an exclusive period of 120 days during which only it 
can propose a plan. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And if it doesn't, then the creditors can? 
</P>
<P>
A. Then any party-in-interest can. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is a party-in-interest? 
</P>
<P>
A. A party that has a vested interest in the proceeding, as recognized by the 
court. In any bankruptcy, you have a debtor -- what used to be called the 
bankrupt -- and the creditors, the creditors committee and the office of the 
U.S. Trustee. The creditors are the primary parties-in-interest, although are 
some peripherally involved as contingent creditors, like an insurer. You can 
also have equity security holders and an equity security holders committee 
acting as parties in interest. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it usual that creditors in a bankruptcy get repaid in full? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If the creditors bitterly object to a plan, can the judge still approve it 
and force them to accept it? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, it's not that simple. There is a confirmation process. The creditors 
committee is set up to allow negotiation between the debtor and creditors, and 
sometimes there are other committees, like equity securities and bondholders. 
The desire is to come up with a negotiated plan. The code requires that a plan 
must be accepted by at least 50% in number and 66% in dollars worth of debt of 
the creditors voting in each class. That means that if there are 100 creditors 
in one class and only three vote and two of them vote to accept it and their 
claims represent at least two-thirds of what is owed to the three voters, then 
the plan is accepted by that class, even though 97% didn't vote. If it is not 
accepted by each of the classes, then the debtor can request that the court 
cram the plan down. A cram-down is a very esoteric procedure; we could do 
another couple of hours interviewing on it. But basically, it means that the 
judge can confirm the plan over objections if at least one class of creditor 
accepts it. In no case can you cram down a plan that all classes are opposed 
to.

NORTHERN BENEFIT, SOUTHERN COMFORT AND A ZYDECO STEW; 
</P>
<P>
SUCCESSOR TO CLIFTON CHENIER REMAINS AT ISSUE AFTER SPICY CAJUN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's always tempting to scour the horizons of any musical genre for future 
figureheads -- especially when the old leader has stepped out of the spotlight. 
That's why any hot young metal band is met with a tag of "the next Zeppelin," 
reggae performers contend with the moniker of "the next Bob Marley" and 
singer-songwriters continue to face the onus of being tabbed "the next Dylan." 
</P>
<P>
In the world of zydeco -- the enticing, rhythmically effervescent branch of 
Cajun music -- the throne that belonged for years to Clifton Chenier remains 
vacant, though there is certainly no shortage of contenders for the crown. 
</P>
<P>
So the drama at Saturday's opening half of the 3rd annual Los Angeles Cajun and 
Zydeco Festival should have been the face-off between two of zydeco's 
new-generation contenders. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner was C.J. Chenier who, upon his father's death in 1987, was 
bequeathed Clifton's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band; in the other was 
Nathan Williams, another favorite son from Lafayette, La., making his first 
West Coast appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The non-contest that unfolded pointed up the folly of searching for dramatics 
at what is primarily a gigantic back-yard barbecue, an event where the spirit 
in the dancing and the spiciness of the home-cooked jambalaya mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the show -- held as it was last year in the Olympic Velodrome at 
Cal State Dominguez Hill -- it was neither Chenier nor Williams and his Zydeco 
Cha-Chas band -- each of whom turned in thoroughly danceable though 
unremarkable sets -- but the ever-dependable Beausoleil band that emerged as 
pick of the litter. 
</P>
<P>
This was because of Beausoleil's seamless fusing of traditional Cajun folk with 
the more muscular zydeco, stitched together with threads of hot-jazz and 
country-blues instrumental licks. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in crowning a new king of zydeco will have to keep looking -- 
or keep waiting, while Williams and Chenier undergo more seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has received some glowing praise from Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural, 
himself a front-runner as Clifton's spiritual successor. Indeed, he had plenty 
of folks up and dancing at the front of the stage at one end of the unusual but 
highly serviceable Velodrome setting. 
</P>
<P>
But beneath his wide-brimmed cowboy hat and behind those impenetrable dark 
sunglasses, whatever personality Williams may possess remained hidden. He has 
an engaging voice that can summon up the grace of Jimmy Cliff's, though his 
riff-heavy music (more of a bar-band-blues-reggae-R&amp;B stew than pure 
zydeco) does not leave that voice much room to express itself. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, near the end of his set, he offered Hank Williams' "Jambalaya" -- a 
song with an unmistakeable melody -- and the energy level jumped with 
Richter-scale force. 
</P>
<P>
With his less-than-dynamic stage presence and accomplished-but-unspectacular 
musicianship, Williams is more promising than impressive. But keep in mind that 
he is still in his mid-20s; be prepared to reassess the evaluation when he has 
a few more years under his accordion straps. 
</P>
<P>
C.J. Chenier has grown markedly as an accordionist since strapping it on about 
2 years ago, though he too suffered a charisma shortage in the always-difficult 
outdoor, daytime setting. More disturbing, though, he succumbed to star-making 
mannerisms you would expect from a Las Vegas lounge singer. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing him while the Red Hot band played a number of its own, a band mate 
hawked the crowd: "Are you ready for star time? Are you ready for show time?" 
</P>
<P>
Like Williams, Chenier opted for pumped-up blues-boogie before turning to 
zydeco. When he did take on the style that made his father's son famous, it was 
with tempos that seemed accelerated artificially to generate more excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, veteran Cajun fiddler Dewey Balfa outpunched the two upstarts in 
his early-afternoon set, helped along with the addition of electric bass and 
drums to his typically acoustic lineup. Balfa, looking like everyone's favorite 
uncle with his white hair, pharmacist's spectacles, slight paunch and 
beneficent, unassuming grin, subtly proved that some old dogs can indeed learn 
new tricks. The new dogs should take notice. 
</P>
<P>
As for the couple of thousand Cajun-zydeco fans who attended, most seemed 
completely content to soak up the sun and suds, offer their own pagan dance 
ritual around a watermelon and dance their soles away. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup for Day 2 of the festival on Sunday was scheduled to include 
headliner Queen Ida Guillory (who may prove that in the quest for someone to 
fill Clifton's shoes, the best man for the job is a woman), the Louisiana Cajun 
Trio and the Crawfish Wranglers, as well as return performances by Beausoleil, 
Balfa and Nathan &amp; the Zydeco Cha-Chas.

COMEDY IS KING AND LOTS MORE IN NETWORK TV PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HILL, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the dust settles from the battles of the odd 1988-89 television season and 
the strategy is outlined for the renewal of the engagement in the fall, it's 
becoming clear that on network television, comedy is not only king, it's also 
queen, prince, princess and handmaiden. 
</P>
<P>
Yet only a few years ago the situation comedy was declared dead. But that was 
B.C. in television years, Before Cosby. What had happened to the sitcom was 
that it had lost the domestic moorings that had served it so well, dating back 
to radio days. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the breakout hit "Mork and Mindy," television executives looked for 
shows with a gimmick, their form of a man from Ork, as if that's what made 
"Mork and Mindy" a hit, not the comic genius of Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the sitcom's travails was the success of Norman Lear's offerings. 
Lear understood the need to create a family for his shows, but his imitators 
only heard the loud, raucous, put-down humor. Show after show was turned out 
with such writing. 
</P>
<P>
Then along came "The Cosby Show," reminding one and all what a situation comedy 
is supposed to be. Not a high-concept, gimmick-driven program but a basic, 
understandable situation that will wear well week after week. And no situation 
is more basic to, understandable by or wears better with that huge mass of 
people needed to make a TV show into a hit than a family. 
</P>
<P>
One need look no further than ABC's blockbuster Tuesday night. "Who's the 
Boss," "The Wonder Years" and "Roseanne" all revolve around a basic domestic 
setup. Since putting this lineup together, ABC has tried to find a compatible 
sitcom to follow "Roseanne" and, despite good numbers, essentially failed with 
"Anything but Love" (on Wednesday nights in the fall) and "Have Faith." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, the network will try again with a show that comes out of the same 
company that produces "The Cosby Show."
