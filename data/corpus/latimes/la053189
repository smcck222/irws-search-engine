LIQUOR SALES CRACKDOWN CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
PACOIMA OUTLET'S PERMIT DENIED; 3 STORES STILL FACE LIMITS 
</P>

The city of Los Angeles took a hard line Tuesday against the proliferation of 
liquor stores in Pacoima when the City Council refused to allow a gas station 
to sell beer and wine, and a city zoning board imposed strict operating 
restrictions on three existing liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
An overabundance of liquor sales outlets, many of which police say sell to 
minors and drunks, has been the focus of recent criticism by Pacoima community 
groups. In response, the Los Angeles Police Department has targeted the stores 
and nearby street corners for a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Many bars and liquor stores in the East San Fernando Valley community are 
"completely out of control" and have become hangouts for vandals and drug 
dealers, Councilman Ernani Bernardi told the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi recommended that the council refuse to grant a permit allowing Mike 
Azzam to sell liquor at his Mobil gas station on San Fernando Mission 
Boulevard, upholding decisions by a city zoning administrator and the Board of 
Zoning Appeals. The council agreed unanimously, 10 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Azzam said the denial was unfair because two nearby gas stations sell liquor. 
"This will have a very bad effect on my business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Bernardi testified at a Board of Zoning Appeals hearing in 
Van Nuys at which three liquor stores on probation for past problems appealed 
restrictions, ranging from limited hours of operation to a ban on sales of 
single cans of beer or mini-bottles of wine and wine coolers. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most vehement complaints I've received involved these three liquor 
stores," Bernardi said. "This is a spotlight they should've been under for some 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The stores reviewed by the board were Leon's Liquors, 10973 Glenoaks Blvd.; 
John's Liquors, 13101 Van Nuys Blvd., and Pacoima Community Market, 13132 Van 
Nuys Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worst Offenders 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Officer Sandy Jo MacArthur, a vice squad member, testified 
that the three were the worst offenders. She said John's and Community Market 
had been cited for selling alcohol to minors during a March sting operation. 
Police frequently make arrests at all three stores for such charges as public 
drunkenness, narcotics sales and prostitution, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The board upheld most of the restrictions imposed by Associate Zoning 
Administrator Jon Perica after a Feb. 10 public hearing. Unless the store 
operators appeal to the City Council, they will have to abide by the rules for 
at least six months, beginning in about a month when the board's decision 
becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
Perica specified that the restrictions be reviewed in six months, at which time 
the board could continue them, add more or seek to have the state revoke the 
stores' liquor permits. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the stores said they believed that they were being unfairly 
singled out of the more than 90 bars, stores and restaurants that sell liquor 
in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"Why come to me and make me a scapegoat?" asked Farah Ammari, who has operated 
the Pacoima Community Market for 16 years. "Why start with a poor little guy 
like me? Start with a rich guy." 
</P>
<P>
Ammari said he would appeal the board's decision. Attorney Joshua Kaplan said 
John's Liquors probably would not appeal, and attorney Richard M. Ruger said 
owners of Leon's Liquors had not yet decided what to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Pacoima Coordinating Council, the community group that has been 
working hardest against liquor sales violations in the area, had mixed feelings 
about Tuesday's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Member Frederick Taylor said he had hoped that the board would be more lenient 
with Leon's Liquors and John's Liquors because operators of those two stores 
have tried to work with the community by voluntarily abiding by many of the 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been very cooperative in trying to work toward the long-term 
solution," he said. "What we wanted to be able to do was hold them up as a 
model. What if they decide not to work with us now?"

NEW POLO FIELD BUILT ILLEGALLY; COUNTY WANTS CHARGES FILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Calabasas Polo Club may end up playing their first chukker in 
court instead of at the new polo field they carved out of a canyon at the 
western edge of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials said Tuesday that they will seek a criminal 
complaint against the club operators, who they say built a regulation-size polo 
field, barn, corrals and a small grandstand with no building or grading 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the equestrian facility may have to be torn down and its 
hillside site re-graded if the Sherman Oaks development company that built it 
cannot prove that a certified geologist watched every step of the earthmoving. 
</P>
<P>
County Building and Safety Division administrators said officials of Lycon 
Group -- which owns the 26-acre site and built the polo complex -- have been 
summoned to a conference with the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be pressing the D.A. to file a criminal complaint," said Jean 
Granucci, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works, which oversees the 
Building and Safety Division. It is a misdemeanor to build or grade without 
proper permits, punishable by a $1,000 fine or a six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Permit fees will be doubled if the plans are accepted and retroactive permits 
are issued, amounting to $2,456 for the grading permit and an uncalculated 
amount for the building permit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Lycon Group, which has built many apartment projects in the 
Valley and elsewhere, said a county official, whom they could not identify, 
initially told them that they needed no permit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're home builders," not polo-field developers, said Rob Franciscan, a Lycon 
Group partner. "We were told that we didn't need a permit because we weren't 
building a habitable structure . . . that for temporary equestrian facilities a 
permit was not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Franciscan said the Calabasas Polo Club will not be open to the public. "It's a 
private, for-our-own-personal-use thing" that will be removed in two or three 
years when his firm builds luxury homes on the site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Franciscan, his staff worked quickly to prepare plans within 30 
days after a passing building inspector happened to notice the construction, a 
few hundred yards north of the Ventura Freeway between Parkway Calabasas and 
Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discovered in March 
</P>
<P>
But building and safety officials say they discovered the illegal construction 
more than two months ago, on March 16. Plans for the structures were submitted 
after construction was completed, said Doug Browne, manager of the county's 
Building and Safety Division office in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
The grading plans were turned over to Browne on Tuesday afternoon by a 
representative of an engineering firm hired after the bulldozing was completed. 
Marites Avante, a civil designer for the firm, said 35,000 cubic yards were 
apparently moved. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my superior how come we're getting this now and he had no idea," she 
said as she stood at Browne's counter to hand in the grading plans. 
</P>
<P>
Other builders who have construction projects near the polo club also were 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"They're big boys," said John Hurford, who is building a 385-home luxury estate 
project west of the Lycon property. "They know they have to have permits to do 
things."

DAVIS AIDE BRALY FILES TO RUN AGAINST WRIGHT FOR ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hunt Braly, state Sen. Ed Davis' top aide, has become the second Republican 
activist to file papers to oppose embattled Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley) in the June, 1990, primary. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to get encouragement from people," said Braly, 34, who is expected 
to be backed by Davis (R-Valencia). "The keys will be a grass-roots campaign 
and raising money." 
</P>
<P>
Braly, who sent his intent-to-run statement to the Fair Political Practices 
Commission on Friday, can now start raising campaign funds. He moved from 
Woodland Hills to Wright's heavily Republican 37th District last week when he 
purchased a condominium in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sixth Term 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 60, has said she will seek a sixth term despite controversy over her 
efforts to intercede for her daughter, who was in trouble with authorities over 
her driving record. 
</P>
<P>
Wright declined to respond directly to Braly's action, but her administrative 
assistant, Catherine Morrison, said, "She says she's looking forward to a 
spirited campaign, and in the meantime, she's just going to concentrate on her 
legislative duties." 
</P>
<P>
Braly's decision, however, drew immediate fire from Bob Larkin, a Simi Valley 
businessman who previously declared his intent to challenge Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, who is first vice chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central 
Committee, said Braly should step down from his post as administrative 
assistant to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin said running for office while representing Davis in the 19th Senate 
District -- which largely overlaps Wright's Assembly district -- would be a 
"conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Braly, a lawyer, said he does not plan to leave his $52,848-a-year post with 
Davis until he formally becomes a candidate in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully aware that some people will say that's a conflict," Braly responded. 
"I don't think there's any reason for me to give up my job to raise some money 
on my own time and explore the possibility of running. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"As I go through the district, people will clearly delineate when I'm 
campaigning and when I'm doing the job for Ed Davis and the constituents he 
represents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attending Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Braly has been highly visible in recent months in the populous Santa Clarita 
Valley, attending meetings on a proposed state park, transportation issues and 
a proposed landfill. Davis recently said this would be his aide's strongest 
base in a far-flung district stretching from Lompoc and Solvang in Santa 
Barbara County, to Simi Valley in Ventura County and to Santa Clarita and the 
Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, 52, said the presence of both himself and Braly in the primary would 
help Wright by dividing the votes of those opposed to the veteran 
assemblywoman. He said he hoped that one of the challengers would ultimately 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the obvious advantage of having had the last couple of years as a field 
man for Ed Davis, and most of the districts overlap," Larkin said of Braly. "He 
has the disadvantage of never having lived in the district, which I have. And I 
have the name recognition in Simi Valley, which has the biggest block of 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
Braly said he plans to focus his bid on Wright's ties to Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco); her well-publicized efforts to keep her 
much-ticketed daughter out of jail and behind the wheel, and transportation, 
education and land-use issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raising Money 
</P>
<P>
Braly said he hoped to raise $200,000 for the race. Even if he reaches this 
goal, he said he expects Wright to outspend him by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said Wright's fund-raising, including a May 19 event, has gone well. 
She did not provide a figure. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge), a 
Wright adversary, said in an interview Tuesday that she would not support Braly 
or any other primary challenger in the 37th District, which borders her 38th 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to remain neutral in the campaign, whatever evolves," La Follette 
said. "I just don't think it's appropriate for other members of the Legislature 
to become involved in primaries." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she said, "I am a strong supporter of open primaries."

HALL MAILER PHOTO ANGERS WIDOW OF COUNCILMAN FINN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anne Finn, widow of Los Angeles Councilman Howard Finn and co-chairman of 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi's reelection campaign against Lyle Hall, Tuesday 
angrily denounced a campaign mailer, which she said implies that she backs 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer, mailed last week to voters throughout the 7th Council District, 
pictures the Finns shaking hands with Hall and states that they "were good 
friends and worked together to make the northeast Valley a better place. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I am highly resentful of Lyle Hall's misuse of Howard's and my name -- and 
picture -- in a deceitful campaign mailer," Finn said. "Shame on Lyle Hall for 
sending out something so completely misleading." 
</P>
<P>
Small print below the caption states that the "use of the photograph is not 
meant to be an endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
Finn said she was offended by the mailer because the photograph implied that 
she supports Hall. She said she told Hall more than a month ago that she 
supports Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rotten Thing to Do' 
</P>
<P>
"I know political races sometimes cause candidates to stretch the truth," Finn 
said. "But the fact remains -- even in a political race -- this was a rotten 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer is one of about 20 mailers that Hall planned to send during his 
runoff campaign to unseat Bernardi, 77, who has served on the City Council for 
28 years. Hall, 49, is on leave from his job as a Los Angeles Fire Department 
captain and is a former president of the firefighters' union. The runoff will 
be Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the picture was not intended to be an endorsement, but rather a 
reminder that "the last time we had a representative that cared was when Howard 
Finn was there." Hall first met and became friends with the Finns in the early 
1980s and often sat with them during social functions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not think that the flyer should damage his friendship with Anne 
Finn because his "feelings of affection and caring" for her "were not damaged 
by her endorsement of Ernie." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer criticized Bernardi's unsuccessful drive in 1986 to repeal the City 
Council's decision to eliminate the northeast Valley's 1st Council District, 
previously represented by Howard Finn until his death in August, 1986. The plan 
divided the territory between Bernardi and Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi and Wachs fought the plan by filing a lawsuit, which was dismissed. 
Then Bernardi initiated a referendum drive to repeal the change in district 
lines, but failed to gather enough signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said the mailer is an "example of the flood and torrent of mailers 
with lies and distortions. I don't know what is going to happen next, but I 
think it will hit a new low." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi also has criticized Hall for emphasizing endorsements from political 
leaders outside the district, such as state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). He 
said such a tactic shows that Hall has failed to gain local grass-roots 
support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorsement Slate 
</P>
<P>
But about six hours after Anne Finn's news conference, Hall announced a slate 
of endorsements that he said proves Bernardi wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them are local people, across the board," he said of a group of black 
community leaders who gathered at the Pacoima Community Center. "But we felt 
our earlier endorsements were a good mix too." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders who endorsed Hall Tuesday included Richard Packard, chairman of the 
San Fernando Valley chapter of the Black Americans Political Assn. of 
California; Jake Flukers, an executive board member of the NAACP; community 
activist Gwen Gatson, and the Rev. Braxton Berkley, associate pastor of Mt. 
Gilead Baptist Church.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO KILLING BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 29-year-old Encino woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder in 
the strangling of her 68-year-old boyfriend during an argument about the 
woman's female lover. 
</P>
<P>
Adele Kathy Rodriguez earlier admitted strangling Stanley Wittman with a strap 
from a pair of overalls, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth A. Loveman. Wittman's 
decomposed body was found on Sept. 15, 1988, by the building manager in the 
couple's Encino apartment in the 5400 block of Newcastle Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been arguing about Rodriguez's female lover, Nancy Ortiz, at the 
time of the slaying, Loveman said. 
</P>
<P>
A week after the killing, police discovered Ortiz driving the victim's 1985 
Oldsmobile Cutlass when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Ortiz told 
police that Rodriguez had admitted to her that she killed Wittman. Rodriguez 
was arrested a short time later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant originally pleaded not guilty to one count of murder. However, 
that charge was dropped in exchange for her plea to the lesser charge, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, on parole for a felony burglary conviction at the time of the 
slaying, remains in custody without bail and is scheduled to return to court on 
June 20 for sentencing. She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in 
prison.

WHITSON POSTS HIS 100TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Whitson said before the game that it would be nice to pitch against the 
Philadelphia Phillies without having to contend with the newly retired Mike 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
What the Padre veteran might have said is that it would be nice to pitch 
against the Phillies, period. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Schmidt, who announced his retirement here Monday after 17-plus 
seasons in which he hit 548 home runs, the Phillies were an absolute disaster. 
Their pitching is so awful that Schmidt in his prime couldn't have saved them. 
</P>
<P>
So when Whitson took the mound at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Tuesday night, 
all he needed for the 100th victory of his major league career was an average 
performance. He did better than that, pitching seven-hit ball for eight 
innings, and his teammates gave him an easy ride by burying the Phillies under 
a 9-3 score in front of 11,710. 
</P>
<P>
Don Carman, a left-hander, lost little time showing why he had won only one 
game all season. He was driven to cover in a fifth-inning bombardment that 
staked Whitson to a 5-0 lead. Mike Maddux, Randy O'Neill and Alex Madrid were 
the other members of the Phillies' woeful pitching staff who toiled, and only 
Maddux escaped punishment as Carman fell to 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's victory was his sixth in a row and gave him an 8-2 record. It made 
him the second winningest pitcher in the National League, enabling him to break 
a tie with Mike Scott of the Houston Astros. He trails only Rick Reuschel of 
the San Francisco Giants, who has won nine games. 
</P>
<P>
For six innings, Whitson was working on a four-hit shutout. By that time, the 
San Diego lead had mounted to 8-0, and he eased up to the extent of giving up 
home runs to Von Hayes and ex-Padre Dickie Thon. Greg Harris pitched the ninth 
and yielded a third homer, that by Curt Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's enjoyment of the balmy evening didn't end with his pitching. He has 
blossomed into a halfway decent hitter lately, and he continued to be a two-way 
threat by singling twice in four times at bat. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' unusually boisterous attack consisted of 14 hits all told, 
including three each by Bip Roberts and Roberto Alomar. They didn't hit any 
home runs, but who cared? 
</P>
<P>
In his pregame comment about Schmidt, Whitson said, "The Phillies won't be the 
same without him. He always terrorized pitchers, and I contributed five or six 
home runs to his total. Once he hit two off me in one game, and we won, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't mind his home runs so much. Every pitcher gave those up. He just 
out-and-out scared me, because he was so strong that if he ever hit me with a 
line drive, I'd be in serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Whitson said pitching coach Pat Dobson had told him to expect 
plenty of hitting support against the Phillies' weak pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Said Whitson: "Dobber said, 'We're going to get you some runs tonight. I can 
feel it.' Once we got seven or eight, I thought, 'Just throw strikes.' I used 
all four of my pitches -- fastball, curve, slider, palm ball. I threw the palm 
ball eight or nine times to a ground ball or a popout, until we got four or 
five runs ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson then talked about the thrill of winning No. 100. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty tickled with this one," he said. "I've been waiting a long time (he 
is 34.) I'm really going to cherish this one." 
</P>
<P>
Of his two hits, Whitson said, "You get lucky every now and then and get a base 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that he hadn't had just one hit but two, he said, "I'll take them." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jack McKeon said of the new ace of his pitching staff, "Whit has been 
consistent all year. He had good command, except for the home runs." 
</P>
<P>
In the loser's quarters, Manager Nick Leyva said, "Whitson is 8-2. He's a good 
pitcher. We hit some good balls off him, but he went out there and did what he 
had to do. He pitched well enough to win, and that's the bottom line as far as 
I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The hapless Carman said, "Other teams are making the games easy and I'm making 
them hard. Usually when I'm getting beat up I know why, but usually the stuff I 
had tonight gets people out." 
</P>
<P>
Leyva said of Carman, "I'm going to do something. Donny's going out there every 
time and trying to pitch perfect. I'm thinking about taking him out of the 
rotation, only for his sake. I want him to know he doesn't have to doubt 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
The Padre first inning provided a preview of things. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and Alomar greeted Carman with singles, and when Carman threw wildly on 
Tony Gwynn's sacrifice bunt, the bases were loaded with nobody out. Roberts 
scored on Carman's balk, after which the Padre offense subsided temporarily. 
Jack Clark struck out for the first of three times, and after Carmelo Martinez 
drew an intentional walk, Benito Santiago forced Alomar at the plate and Luis 
Salazar flied out. 
</P>
<P>
Carman pitched beautifully for the next three innings. He even struck out 
Clark, Martinez and Santiago in order in the third. In the fifth, however, the 
same Padre threesome nicked him for successive hits that ran the score to 5-0. 
Carman invited trouble by walking Roberts and Gwynn, and doubles by Clark and 
Martinez and a single by Santiago drove home four runs. 
</P>
<P>
An inning later, Whitson led off with his second single and raced home on 
Roberts' triple. Alomar's single and Gwynn's double made it 8-0, and the Padres 
breezed in from there. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
As a superstar himself, Tony Gwynn of the Padres can empathize with Mike 
Schmidt. Schmidt, who announced his retirement Monday after 17-plus seasons 
with the Philadelphia Phillies, hit 548 home runs, won 10 Gold Gloves as a 
third baseman and is cinch to be named to the Baseball Hall of Fame. "It made 
me think about my own situation," Gwynn said Tuesday night. "I hope I get an 
opportunity to leave like he did, instead of getting traded a couple of times 
or being released. He had the privilege of being with the same team throughout 
his career, and that was great. I hope I'm that lucky." Gwynn, who has won 
three National League batting championships and has played in four All-Star 
Games, has no immediate worries about following Schmidt out of baseball. He is 
only 29. "Seeing Mike in tears at his press conference brought tears to my 
eyes, too," Gwynn said. "He made people realize that he's an emotional guy and 
that this is an emotional game. Remember, too, that by retiring when he did, he 
turned down a lot of money. A lot of guys hang on beyond their time, and money 
is the biggest factor. Mike has so much pride that he couldn't bear the thought 
of sticking around beyond his time." 
</P>
<P>
Denis Menke, a Philadelphia coach and a former major league third baseman 
himself, said of Schmidt: "I could see what was going through his mind the last 
few weeks. He started the season OK, but lately he wasn't getting around on the 
ball. He was missing fastballs that he normally would crush. On top of that, he 
couldn't get to some ground balls anymore, and his arm wasn't what it used to 
be. He showed a lot of class in getting out when he did. The way he was 
playing, he felt he just had to hang it up." . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
called Schmidt 'a credit to the game and to the Phillies, a sure Hall of 
Famer." Then, looking at Schmidt's retirement from a practical standpoint, 
McKeon said, "He sure put a lot of scares in me. I'm glad he decided to retire 
before they played us."

ANGELS GIVE MILWAUKEE THE BRUSH OFF; 
</P>
<P>
ABBOTT WINS AGAIN, 3-2, BUT ENDURES BREWERS' WRATH FOR HITTING POLIDOR

<P>
Inside pitches were thrown. Warnings from the umpire were given. Words were 
exchanged, benches cleared and the managers went nose-to-nose. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when it was all over, along with the Angels' 3-2 victory over the 
Milwaukee Brewers Tuesday night, the incident had been conveniently purged from 
Angel memory. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, no one knew if the fastball the Angels' Jim Abbott bounced off Gus 
Polidor's arm was intended as retaliation for the pitch that sailed alongside 
Claudell Washington's ear flap earlier in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, no one knew what Polidor said to Abbott or to Angel Manager Doug 
Rader, words that resulted in the emptying of both dugouts and had relief 
pitchers climbing over outfield fences to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, no one knew what Rader and Milwaukee Manager Tom Trebelhorn had to 
say as bodies swirled around their heated discussion along the third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
The gag rule ruled in the Angel clubhouse in the aftermath of the club's fourth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no big deal," Rader insisted. "It's not worth commenting on. I really 
don't have too much to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
Around the rest of the locker room, that sentiment stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy? What controversy? 
</P>
<P>
"Abbie sure pitched a good game, didn't he?" infielder Glenn Hoffman said, 
deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, he did. For seven innings, Abbott shut out the Brewers. He worked 
seven-plus, leaving the game with a tight left shoulder, on his way to his 
fifth victory in eight major league decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott allowed only two hits, yielding singles to Rob Deer and Charlie O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the man he hit, Polidor, that enlivened the game more than any pitch 
he delivered at County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
For the Angels' benefit, a little background is necessary: 
</P>
<P>
Washington had homered and singled in his first two at-bats against Milwaukee 
starter Bryan Clutterbuck before Clutterbuck sent Washington sprawling with an 
inside fastball in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the fifth, Abbott stared at the first Brewer batter to step to 
the plate -- ex-Angel Polidor -- and plunked him with his first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Polidor began jawing at Abbott as he walked down the first-base line and 
stopped before he got there, which brought players from both sides out of their 
dugouts. Home plate umpire Ken Kaiser issued Abbott a warning and order was 
restored -- until Polidor reached third base. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Polidor began jawing at Rader, who as he is known to do, jawed 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Rader was walking up the dugout steps and Trebelhorn was walking across 
the diamond. Moments later, the managers were face-to-face, arguing, while 
players surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the tempest subsided and the inning progressed to a rather quiet 
conclusion, with Paul Molitor striking out to strand Polidor. 
</P>
<P>
What did Polidor say to Abbott? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear," Abbott said. "I guess he was a little unhappy with the pitch." 
</P>
<P>
What did Polidor say to Rader? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't understand," Rader said. "It was a discussion of some sorts. I didn't 
quite make it out." 
</P>
<P>
Was Abbott's pitch a payback for Clutterbuck's brushback of Washington? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott claimed that "the pitch just got away from me. You've seen me pitch all 
year. I pitch inside. I don't have the best control in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
Angel catcher Lance Parrish, who also didn't hear anything, said Polidor was 
attempting to bunt -- this is true -- when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran into it," Parrish said. "He was trying to bunt, we were trying to cut a 
fastball in on him, he had his bat out and the ball hit his arm. I don't think 
there's any way he can get out of the way on that pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Said Abbott: "It was a 2-0 game. (Polidor) is an awful big run, and they've got 
(Mike) Felder up next and then you get Molitor. Hitting him there didn't make 
much sense." 
</P>
<P>
In the Brewer clubhouse, however, it did, although Polidor, slow to emerge from 
the shower, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect Abbott for doing that," Clutterbuck said. "I had a feeling that was 
going to happen. I knock somebody down and the next pitch he throws, he hits a 
guy. That's part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, that was something the Angels were willing to comment on. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a man's game," Angel left fielder Chili Davis said. "The game has 
always been played that way and it'll always be played that way. It shouldn't 
surprise anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like that Pearl Harbor thing. They started it and we finished it." 
</P>
<P>
Rader tended to agree, but had to wonder why so much commotion was being made 
about two inside pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have the mentality of playing 20 years ago," Rader said. "To me, it's 
no big deal. Going to the mound (as Polidor did), I just don't understand that. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a different era. When we played, there weren't any rules. It's a 
much different game now." 
</P>
<P>
In Rader's mind, Polidor should have taken his lump without a word and let the 
teams continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll ever understand why these things happen, for no apparent 
reason," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
But when they do, the new Angel credo is to forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The tightness Jim Abbott experienced in his left shoulder was new, he said, but 
he wasn't worried about it. "It got a little tight, a little sore, but it may 
be because of the (cold) weather," Abbott said. Abbott pitched through it, 
however, retiring the side in order four times before walking the first two 
batters in the eighth inning. At that point, Manager Doug Rader replaced Abbott 
with Greg Minton, who allowed both runs to score on a two-run single by Robin 
Yount. Abbott admitted losing the chance at a shutout "bothered me a little 
bit, but at the time, I really wasn't thinking that way. I was tired at that 
point. When you're doing everything right and you're still throwing balls 
(outside the strike zone), that's probably a good indication. I can't question 
the decision to take me out." . . . For Abbott, the victory was his fourth this 
month. In his last three starts, Abbott is 3-0 with a 1.69 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure, who pitched a perfect ninth inning, was credited with his first 
American League save since Oct. 4, 1985. On that day, McClure was pitching for 
the Milwaukee Brewers, preserving a victory against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>

BLUE MARLIN ARRIVING IN BIG NUMBERS OFF BAJA PENINSULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the biggest blue marlins ever taken from the waters off the Baja 
Peninsula highlighted the species' springtime arrival, which has spiced up some 
of the best striped marlin fishing in years. 
</P>
<P>
Striped marlin are apparently so plentiful in some areas -- basically from Los 
Frailes to the Gorda Banks -- that hotel boats are averaging up to 18 hookups a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, in the Cabo San Lucas area, boats are averaging just over two 
billfish a day. "They're biting not too far away," Mario Gonzalez, a Cabo San 
Lucas panga owner, said by telephone Tuesday. Gonzalez said fishermen aboard 
his panga have been catching most of their fish two to three miles south of the 
marina. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, boats from as far north as Rancho Buena Vista on the East Cape are 
reportedly making the two-hour ride to the Gorda Banks area to get in on the 
bite. "Conditions are just prime," John Doughty of Bisbee's Tackle in Newport 
Beach said. "Some fishermen are seeing 100 fish a day."

Jack Haige, visiting from Norwalk, Conn., and fishing aboard the Juanita V near 
the outer Gorda Bank, will take the one fish he caught June 23, a 959-pound 
blue marlin that took him to hours to land. 
</P>
<P>
Haige trolled a 15-pound dorado he caught earlier to attract the fish, which he 
reeled in on 80-pound tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Sport fishermen at the popular resort have yet to catch a blue marlin weighing 
more than 1,000 pounds, but several have been close. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Edmondson, Region 5 manager for the conservationist California Trout 
organization, calls Crowley Lake "the black hole of fishery management" -- 
meaning that nobody really knows what's going on beneath the surface of the 
Eastern Sierra reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
With the balance of the Crowley catch shifting in recent years from brown trout 
to Sacramento perch, the Department of Fish and Game wants to know what happens 
to the 350,000 sub-catchable trout it plants in Crowley each year. In 
collaboration with Cal Trout, the DFG has launched a fish-clipping program in 
hopes of finding out. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers at the Fish Springs Hatchery near Big Pine recently clipped the fins 
of 17,969 Kamloop, Coleman and Hot Creek rainbows -- a different fin for each 
strain, so they can be identified when caught. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do 25% (of 350,000) to make it viable," Edmondson said, adding that 
the purpose is "to determine which are best suited to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Milliron, a fishery biologist and project leader for the DFG, said, 
"We've had fin-clipped fish going into Crowley for many years," but not in 
enough numbers to provide a solid analysis." 
</P>
<P>
Fin-clipping is scheduled to resume this weekend and that of June 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way to save the financially troubled hyperbaric chamber on 
Santa Catalina Island, one of the most popular diving areas in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber, operated by USC, has treated 591 divers since it went into 
operation in 1974, and many feel that without it there would be a dramatic 
increase in diving-related fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
"We save lives," Director Andrew Pilmanis insists. "A lot of people would die 
unless a chamber is close by . . . we've had people come in here in full 
(cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and they walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Pilmanis said that during a busy summer weekend divers make anywhere from 2,000 
to 3,000 dives off the Catalina shoreline. The next closest chamber is at 
Northridge Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has provided funding since 1974, but because of budget 
restraints it can presently cover only about half the operational costs, 
according to report by USC's Hancock Institute for Marine Studies. 
</P>
<P>
The rest comes primarily from private donations and diving-safety programs 
offered by the volunteers at the Catalina Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly

For the record: It was reported here two weeks ago that there had never been a 
1,000-pound marlin caught by a recreational fisherman off Baja Peninsula, but a 
blue marlin weighing 1,056 pounds was caught off Cabo San Lucas by John Conant 
of North Hollywood in 1977.

DIGEST: TWO SPRINTERS SIGN TO ATTEND CS NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sprinters Cela Taylor of Alameda Encinal High and Charlotte Vines of Santa 
Barbara San Marcos High have signed letters of intent to attend Cal State 
Northridge in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, winner of North Coast Section 2-A Division titles in the 200 and 400 
meters, has personal bests of 24.99 seconds (24.0 wind-aided) in the former and 
55.74 in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Vines has run 11.89 in the 100 and 25.75 in the 200. She placed second in the 
100 and fourth in the 200 in the Southern Section 3-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
John Crow resigned his position as Agoura High baseball coach last week after 
the Chargers' Southern Section 2-A Division playoff loss to St. Bernard and 
will concentrate on his duties as the school's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Williams, the former athletic director, has been named the school's 
assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, 45, posted a 45-36-2 record and his teams qualified for the playoffs 
three times in four years. He also led the Chargers to the Frontier League 
title in 1986 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some real mixed feelings about this," Crow said. "I got the overall 
feeling that the juniors would like to have me around for one more year." 
</P>
<P>
For the last month of the '89 season, Crow divided his time between athletic 
director and baseball coach before deciding to concentrate on the 
administrative position. "I have to focus my attentions on one job," Crow said. 
"I'd be doing half a job at each and that's not my way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
John Tomac, 21, of Chatsworth maintained his ninth-place standing Tuesday after 
the second stage of the 13-day Milk Race through parts of England and Wales. He 
leads all other American entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing 32nd in Tuesday's 122-mile stage, Tomac trails Keith Reynolds 
of Great Britain by 21 seconds in the overall standings for the approximately 
1,200-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Scott McKinley of Carmichael, Calif., entered the stage as the top American but 
lost his sixth-place position after missing the decisive move with about 13 
miles remaining. Reynolds, who led at the time by 1 minute, 35 seconds, had his 
lead pared to a mere 14 seconds at the finish in Bristol, England.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
GAIN WITHOUT PAIN A WINNING REGIMEN FOR MONROE'S HENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sean Henson, hedonist? 
</P>
<P>
A couch potato? Spud or stud? 
</P>
<P>
Can this be the guy who struck out nine in a 4-2 win over San Fernando High in 
the first round of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs last Friday? 
</P>
<P>
Consider the Monroe High junior left-hander's less-than-stressful workout 
regimen during the recent teachers' strike, which forced cancellation of play 
and official team practices for two weeks. It seems that Henson spent most of 
his time hanging out, rather than ironing out his hanging curves. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw a couple of times over the vacation, uh, strike," he said. "I didn't 
do much running." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Costic, the other half of the Monroe pitching staff, says that while some 
players used the break to put in some extra baseball work, Henson went his own 
way. But Costic found no fault with Henson's success, i.e., Zs apparently 
leading to Ks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sean hasn't done that much," Costic said. "I think he did a lot of sleeping 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Henson, who finished with a six-hitter, kept the San Fernando bats in a deep 
sleep. After the Tigers took a 2-0 lead in the second inning -- the key blow 
was a triple that rolled to the fence on Monroe's lightning-fast turf (which 
had not been watered because of the strike) -- Henson settled down. 
</P>
<P>
In the late innings, Henson (5-5) escaped several jams with the strikeout and 
double-play ball. San Fernando hit into inning-ending double plays in the 
third, fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 2-2, in the sixth, the Tigers loaded the bases and 
threatened to blow the game open. Henson, however, struck out the side. In 
fact, he struck out both pinch-hitter Fernando Ortega and designated-hitter 
John Najar on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
For an encore, Henson struck out Jess Romero and Richard Ortiz -- both entered 
the game with batting averages better than .400 -- in the seventh to end the 
game. Of the final nine outs, six came on strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs were a little wobbly," Henson said, "but my arm felt real strong in 
the late innings." 
</P>
<P>
Early innings were another story. The game's first batter, Romero, was plunked 
by an 0-and-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"That was nerves showing," Henson said. "I hadn't thrown and I didn't know what 
to expect." 
</P>
<P>
And with eight right-handed batters in the Tiger lineup, it looked like Henson 
might not last long. Yet he soon righted the ship. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually like throwing to right-hand batters," Henson said. "I can come in 
on them and spot pitches better, and the fastball tails away from them." 
</P>
<P>
The movement of Henson's fastball made it difficult for San Fernando to 
execute. Usually a team that does the little things right, the Tigers failed 
four times on sacrifice-bunt attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"Sean's ball, with the way it moves around, is hard to lay down," said Costic, 
who played first base Friday and was charging toward home plate in each 
sacrifice situation. "I kept expecting to have to make the throw, but they 
never got the ball down. He just challenged them." 
</P>
<P>
It must have seemed hauntingly familiar for San Fernando, which last season was 
upset by Monroe, 3-2, in the 4-A championship. Henson struck out 10 in that 
game.

<P>
ERRORS DERAIL THOUSAND OAKS IN SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior right-hander Alicia Zinner pitched a one-hitter, but Thousand Oaks High 
committed three errors in the sixth inning and dropped a 2-0 decision to Santa 
Maria St. Joseph in a Southern Section 5-A Division softball playoff semifinal 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Suzzanne Pickett and Michelle Ourque reached base on errors in the sixth and 
scored when Jenny Garcia's infield popup was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Zinner (20-5) surrendered a leadoff single in the first, yielded three walks 
and struck out six in pitching a complete game for the Lancers (25-6). 
</P>
<P>
"The first inning was really tough," Zinner said. "I was so nervous and it (the 
hit) just made it even worse." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks was limited to singles by Jamie Heggen, Tricia Gregoire and 
Phronsie Franco. 
</P>
<P>
3-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Covina 7, Saugus 2 -- Brandy Rico's two-run home run was all Saugus mustered in 
a semifinal game at Northview High in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Covina (25-0-1) scored four runs on five hits off Cathy Lewis (20-8) in the 
second inning to take a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
2-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe 1, Notre Dame 0 -- Junior right-hander Becca Berline of Notre Dame 
took a one-hitter into the seventh, but host Santa Fe surged for the winning 
run on two singles and a bases-loaded fielder's choice in the semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Berline (17-9) struck out five and did not allow a walk. The Knights finished 
17-10. 
</P>
<P>
1-A DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
Agoura 10, Paraclete 3 -- Sophomore right-hander Melissa Thatcher pitched a 
four-hitter and struck out four and Jill Hartwig singled in three runs in the 
fifth inning as Agoura advanced in a semifinal playoff in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura will play Big Bear, a 5-1 winner over St. Bonaventure, in the 
championship game at Mayfair Park in Lakewood on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Baertschiger had three hits to lead Agoura (22-2), which has won 19 
consecutive games.

HIGH SCHOOL REVIEW / SCOTT MILLER; 
</P>
<P>
ARMSTRONG IS NAMED ST. AUGUSTINE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Miller 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Armstrong has been named the new basketball coach at St. Augustine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Armstrong took over a Granite Hills team that had gone 1-21 
the previous season and proceeded to build a 43-29 record. But he wasn't a 
full-time teacher, and the St. Augustine job, vacant since Dick Hardick 
resigned after last season, offered a teaching position as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I will have an opportunity to teach, plus the fact that it 
sounds to me like the school really supports building the athletic program, are 
basically the two reasons I decided to take the challenge," Armstrong said. 
"They're building a new weight room, a new track, and they hired a new athletic 
director and football coach (Marty Martin) last year. They're basically 
rebuilding the athletic program." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' basketball team was 2-18 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Add coaching changes: Tim Meinert is leaving as baseball coach at Christian 
High for a teaching job La Jolla Country Day, where he will likely assist Peter 
Ogle with the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going for the teaching job," Meinert said. "I was offered a job as the 
head of the math department and teaching three classes. It's a lighter load and 
more money. My wife just had a baby two weeks ago and quit work, so our income 
was cut in half. I knew then I'd have to look around. I know Peter wants me to 
work with him, but we haven't worked out the details yet." 
</P>
<P>
Meinert's replacement at Christian has not been named. 
</P>
<P>
In another baseball coaching change, Dave Heid has resigned at Fallbrook. His 
replacement has not been named, either. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, Chip Holmes is replacing Jan Chapman at Hilltop, and Steve Milke 
will not return as head coach at Bonita Vista. 
</P>
<P>
And Shawn Wirth, athletic director at Torrey Pines, is giving up some of her 
day-to-day responsibilities as the school's gymnastics coach and will hire two 
more coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal (Nancy Giberson) didn't want me to coach, because it took away 
from my primary job as athletic director (during the spring)," Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines gymnast Tasha Taylor finished 22nd out of 60 gymnasts Friday at 
the National High School Gymnastics Meet in Rolling Meadows, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Her best event was the uneven parallel bars, where she was 11th with an 8.85. 
</P>
<P>
"She had to compete two days in a row, so she just didn't do very well," Wirth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was an accomplishment that Taylor even arrived at the meet. She won 
the San Diego Section optional all-around title Thursday -- her second in two 
years -- and then flew all night to get to the national meet, which began at 11 
a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Scott Karl threw a three-hitter Saturday as Carlsbad beat Crawford, 
9-0, in a San Diego Section 2-A baseball playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
But while Karl handed Crawford its first shutout this season, he didn't help 
the Carlsbad offense much: He was the lone Lancer to go hitless. And he bats 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can pitch like this, I don't care about batting," Karl said, smiling. 
</P>

Karl has pitched Carlsbad into this afternoon's championship game against 
Grossmont after recovering from a broken ankle. He broke it playing soccer this 
winter, and three screws were inserted during surgery on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
After a late start, Karl has made a pretty good recovery. He is 5-1 with a 0.00 
earned-run average in 38 innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel second baseman Ed Cornblum hit a two-run home run in the third 
inning of Mt. Carmel's 5-4 victory over Mira Mesa in a San Diego Section 3-A 
baseball semifinal game Saturday at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
What have Cornblum's teammates called him all season? "Shortage," as in power 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Webb is attending a City Council meeting this morning to ask the city 
to help subsidize the section football championships in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A five-year agreement to use the stadium for the 2-A and 3-A championships, 
during which the city contributed as much as $8,700 each year, has expired. 
Webb is negotiating a new two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for last year's games was $17,787. That covered the cost of rent, 
lights, sound system and scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Three San Diego athletes own the top marks in the state going into this 
weekend's state track meet: Orange Glen's Lenny McGill in the triple jump 
(50-4), Fallbrook's Brent Noon in the shot put (69-8 1/4, state record) and 
Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen in the 1,600 (4:53.66).

ALICE KAHN: 7 DWARF PERSONALITIES SHARE WRITING DUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes I am seized by this terrible fear that anything I write will either 
hurt somebody, offend somebody or, worse yet, bore somebody. As Joan Didion 
said, "Writers are always selling somebody out." I know it's true, but I can't 
decide which is worse -- mean-o-phobia or yawn-o-phobia. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is compounded by the fact that I am a multiple personality. At last 
count, astute reader-therapists have identified at least seven distinct 
characters in my columns -- Jokey, Nasty, Softy, Lefty, Righty, Sunny and Joan 
Didiony. 
</P>
<P>
It gets so confusing that I've thought of joining a selves-help group. 
Compounding the problem is the fact that each personality has her own 
supporters. Take this letter that recently arrived for one of the seven faces 
of me. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Alice: I am a big fan of yours. Please don't lose your edge. I have two 
words of advice for you: get cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARK 
</P>
<P>
I answered him as best I could: 
</P>
<P>
Dear Mark: Thanks for your kind letter. Get cruel, huh? OK, drop dead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ALICE 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, some readers will fall for Sunny and then get mad when Sunny 
turns blue and begins to beget Nasty. Recently, I got two letters attacking me 
for making fun of two notoriously unsacred bulls. How dare I laugh at Donald 
("the nicest person I ever met") Trump, one reader complained. Another reader 
went even further: 
</P>
<P>
Dear Alice: I can't believe what you said about Richard Nixon. If you don't 
have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TRISHA 
</P>
<P>
Well, pinch me, but am I the first person to crack a Nixon joke? The truth is 
this: No, I don't have anything nice to say about Richard M. Nixon. And I will 
defend to the death my right not to say it. 
</P>
<P>
Some people tell me they like only my "serious" columns. Others like me only 
when I'm politically correct/left. One woman came up to me on the street and 
said, "I saw you on TV and you said something that didn't sound liberal and I 
was wondering what was with you." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it must have been the editing," I said. "You know how these TV shows just 
want a sound bite. They must've cut out the part where I said, 'Let's 
expropriate all private property. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
All this factionalism is making it hard for me to work. I start out the same 
way every morning. While I'm putting on my baggy pants and T-shirt, I imagine 
I'm a samurai putting on my warrior clothes. Or maybe a priest laying out my 
vestments. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as I'm eating my Shredded Wheat and banana and drinking my coffee, I 
imagine that I'm bowing and praying for courage before the god or gods of my 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
I face my word processor like a gladiator. I'm off to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in the crowd yells, "Nasty!" 
</P>
<P>
Someone else yells, "Sunny!" 
</P>
<P>
(No one says a word about Cher.) 
</P>
<P>
A guy in left field screams, "Social responsibility!" 
</P>
<P>
My friend Judy pleads, "Don't quote me!" 
</P>
<P>
And I tell myself that I have made a solemn, sacred covenant with the readers. 
I will try to the utmost of my ability not to bore you, and you will try to the 
utmost of your ability to get to the end of my column. 
</P>
<P>
And when we get to the end, we never know who we will find there. Today, it 
appears to be Lady Liberty, the self that treasures freedom. Not just that I am 
free to be you and me but that people everywhere just gotta be free. From 
columnists to communists, from Berkeley to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
So today we salute Richard Nixon, the man who brought democracy to China. I say 
this knowing that I'm selling out several of my selves. But there's plenty more 
where they come from.

MYTHOLOGY, METAPHYSICS OF DE LA SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The DA.I.S.Y. Age did not dawn as scheduled on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That's when De La Soul, the rap trio that's as subversive in its gentle way as 
the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy are in their loud way, made its Southern 
California debut. Appearing as part of a four-act rap package at the Celebrity 
Theatre in Anaheim, the group didn't come within a happy-face's diameter of the 
wonders of its recent debut album. 
</P>
<P>
"3 Feet High and Rising" might be the most significant rap album since the 
Beastie Boys drilled the sound into the heart of the mainstream audience a 
couple of years ago. It's certainly more ambitious: Intellectual, cosmic, sweet 
and funny, the LP delivers a call for independence and individuality in a 
setting that expands rap's sonic horizons. 
</P>
<P>
To borrow an apt '60s phrase, the album is a total environment where often 
woozy, dislocated sounds draw you into De La Soul's world of mythology and 
metaphysics. The group depicts itself as being teleported here from Mars, and 
it delights in arcane symbolism. The DA.I.S.Y. Age is one of their key 
catch-phrases, and they explain that word daisy is actuallyan acronym for "the 
inner sound. . . ." The LP's first track "The Magic Number" sounds like a hip 
discourse on the mystery of the Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
It can get silly, but it never seems trivial, and for every gross-out riff 
about body odor or bad breath, there's a dead-sober comment on social crises -- 
infant drug addicts, destructive cycles of ghetto life. They balance lust with 
a true-love proposal in "Eye Know" (which employs an old Steely Dan refrain), 
and "Take It Off" is a call to shed the status-symbol regalia of fads and 
fashions. 
</P>
<P>
The collages, jump-cuts, dialogue, recurring themes and mind-expanding impulses 
add up to something closer to '60s Mothers of Invention than '80s Run-D.M.C. 
</P>
<P>
But when the group's two front men, Posdnuos and Trugoy, asked the audience 
Monday what this group is all about, they received an indistinct roar in reply. 
That was the problem: You couldn't really tell from the show. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't it click? First of all, the mix was harsh and muffled, grounding De 
La Soul's distinctive sound. Their music is more subtle, intimate, multilayered 
and intricate than the bold, hard-edged verse of Monday's other two main acts, 
L.A.'s Rodney-O &amp; Joe Cooley and New Yorker Big Daddy Kane. Those rappers' 
declamatory verses are less innovative, but they're much better suited to the 
concert format. 
</P>
<P>
Headliner Kane came off as an inherently uncharismatic old pro going through 
the motions, but he knows how to push the right buttons, and he got the crowd 
going with his black pride and anti-drug messages, and with the kinetic 
routines of his two flat-topped dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney-O and Cooley were sparked by the latter's amazing solos at the 
turntables, many of them executed with flashy spins and behind-the-back moves. 
</P>
<P>
As for De La Soul (which was also scheduled to headline the Palace on Tuesday), 
they stomped around like most any rap act, and though they backed up their 
message of nonconformity by dressing funny and looking more like grad students 
than street guys, they seemed tentative. 
</P>
<P>
Their lack of stage savvy might be a case of inexperience, but it's possible 
that De La Soul's special music needs a different medium -- a movie, perhaps, 
or a TV a sitcom. How about a "De La Soul's Playhouse"? 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, to borrow another bit of their lingo, De La Heaven can wait.

WILD ANIMNAL PARK OPTS FOR TAME SUMMER SHOWCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to speculation, the San Diego Wild Animal Park this year will not 
resume presenting a full summer pop-concert season at its 5,000-capacity Mahala 
Amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of showcasing nationally known pop stars every weekend between Memorial 
Day and Labor Day, as they did from 1982 until 1986, park officials will limit 
summer bookings to four shows, as they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The concert series was originally conceived as a marketing tool, as an 
opportunity for us to introduce the park to -- and draw to the park -- 
individuals who otherwise might not venture out," said Wild Animal Park 
spokesman Tom Hanscom. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, he said, the weekly concerts -- mostly by oldies acts like Jan and 
Dean, the Everly Brothers, and the late Roy Orbison -- did just that, boosting 
park attendance and more than justifying the necessary expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"But after four years, we found the same people were coming back, again and 
again," Hanscom said. "We were no longer attracting new folks to the park, so 
the investment was no longer paying off." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the Wild Animal Park's summer concert program was dropped 
in 1987, replaced by a weekly series of wildlife and cultural presentations 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Every weekend we would spotlight a different part of the globe," Hanscom said. 
"We would talk about and show off animals from, say, Australia, and then 
present native music by an Australian bush band. 
</P>
<P>
"But we didn't see the attendance we wanted, by any means, so in 1988 we went 
to a mix of programs, recognizing that some people like animal shows, some like 
concerts, and it's best not to do only one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what we're doing this year, as well." 
</P>
<P>
The park's abbreviated 1989 summer concert season began last weekend with 
Friday and Saturday evening shows by the Platters, the Coasters and Bobby 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up are Blood, Sweat and Tears, July 1 and 2; Jan and Dean, July 29 and 
30; and the Kingston Trio, Sept. 2 and 3. Concerts are free with admission to 
the park, which is six miles east of Escondido, just off California 78. 
</P>
<P>
The search for a fourth act to round out the bill at X-Fest II is finally over. 
Joining New Order, Public Image Ltd., and the Sugarcubes at San Diego State 
University's Aztec Bowl on June 17 will be De La Soul, a hot new rap band from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Lou Reed was supposed to play the show, but New Order, the 
headliners, objected. Rumor has it that someone from the band phoned Reed's 
manager and said, "Lou's too good to open for us." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but so is virtually everybody else -- including PIL, the Sugarcubes, and 
De La Soul. For several years now, the American Top 40 has been polluted by an 
endless stream of sound-alike techno-pop dance hits by synthesizer-happy Brits, 
and New Order is one of the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Technique," the latest album by this particularly annoying outfit, is a 
wretched example of what can happen when machines take over: mind-numbing disco 
in which the only thing that matters is the beat -- throbbing, mechanical, 
relentless. 
</P>
<P>
New Order's melodies are boring and derivative, and their lyrics are so vapid, 
so mindless, that the House of Commons should seriously consider passing a law 
prohibiting anyone with a pretty-boy hairdo and an affected lisp from getting 
anywhere near a pen and notepad. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The May 19 opener of this year's Concerts by the Bay series at 
Humphrey's got off to a late start when the Four Tops appeared on stage 20 
minutes behind schedule. The reason: Half the group, Lawrence Payton and Abdul 
Fakir, couldn't pull themselves away from the televised Chicago-New York 
basketball playoff game they were watching in promoter Kenny Weissberg's hotel 
room. "I promised them I'd give them a play-by-play account of the last two 
minutes," Weissberg said, "but they told me to relax and continued watching." 
Only after Michael Jordan spun his last-second magic to win the game did the 
two Tops join the other two Tops on stage. Quipped Weissberg: "It's a good 
thing the game didn't go into overtime." . . . Natalie Cole's canceled May 12 
appearance at Humphrey's has been rescheduled for sometime in September. The 
exact date should be announced later this week. . . . Two more additions to the 
Del Mar Fair's 1989 grandstand concert line-up: Midge Ure at 2 p.m. and Howard 
Jones at 7:30 p.m. July 2. . . . Voices, just signed by MCA Records, will be 
playing tonight at Metro in Hillcrest. It's the San Diego rock band's last 
local appearance before they hit the road for a national tour. . . . Scott 
Pedersen has left Bill Silva Presents and plans to set up his own 
concert-promoting business. . . . Tickets go on sale at 3 p.m. Friday for a 
July 2 concert by Ratt at San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre. Then, 
at 10 a.m. Saturday, tickets go on sale for two other Open Air Theatre shows: 
the newly added second show by Oingo Boingo June 26 and David Sanborn's July 13 
appearance.

Wedding March: Oscar-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch and independent 
television producer Terre Blair were married Monday in an outdoor ceremony on 
the banks of the Hudson River in New York. The marriage was the first for 
Hamlisch, 44, who has won three Academy Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, as well as 
Grammy, Tony and Golden Globe awards. Two of his Oscars were for "The Way We 
Were," and one for "The Sting." It was the second marriage for Blair, a native 
of Columbus, Ohio. Liza Minnelli, Ann-Margret and Carly Simon were among the 
guests, along with actor George Segal, who serenaded the newlyweds on the 
banjo, and singer Roberta Flack, who performed "The First Time Ever I Saw Your 
Face." The couple planned to leave Tuesday for a honeymoon in Europe. ALEENE

When the annual Children's Miracle Network telethon takes the air Sunday for 21 
consecutive hours from Disneyland, it not only will be carried by stations 
across the United States but also will be broadcast in the People's Republic of 
China and the Soviet Union. The telethon's organizers believe this is the first 
time a U.S.-based telethon has aired in those countries. The event 
traditionally raises money to benefit children's hospitals throughout North 
America, and this year it also will help raise funds for children's hospitals 
in the Soviet Union and China. The telethon will include a live performance by 
a Russian youth choir and a split-screen telecast with hosts in the Soviet 
Union and Marie Osmond and John Schneider as the U.S. hosts. The telethon will 
be seen on Channel 9 starting Saturday at 6 p.m. (Channel 3 in Santa Barbara 
also starts the telethon Saturday at 6 p.m.; Channel 8 in San Diego tunes in at 
7 p.m.). Since it started in 1983, the telethon has raised $170 million for 
children's hospitals. ALEENE MacMINN

Actress Kelly McGillis is working hard to increase awareness on the subject of 
rape. McGillis, a rape victim herself, recently hosted "Against Her Will," a 
documentary on the Lifetime cable network about rape on college campuses. "The 
fact that so many men (1-in-13) admitted to forcing women into sex was amazing 
to me," she says. "I thought it was incredibly high. The number of women who 
had been forced into sex and didn't know it (73%) at the time was amazing too." 
McGillis also recently worked with a Santa Monica rape crisis center to make a 
video that will be distributed on college campuses, and she and her husband are 
working on another video for victims of violent crimes. ALEENE MacMINN

SPALDING GRAY'S 'OLD WISE TALES' SPIN MEEKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Everyone has a story," says raconteur Spalding Gray near the end of "Old Wise 
Tales" (tonight at 10:30 on Channel 28). So why don't we hear more of them? 
</P>
<P>
We hear snippets of folk wisdom from the group of old-timers Gray found at a 
senior center in the Fairfax District, but we hear no particularly engaging 
tales. Some of the folk wisdom is phrased colorfully, but much of it is very 
bland -- the sort of thoughts that might stray through the head of any 
reasonably happy person. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, these people do seem quite happy, and it's nice to hear that 
old age isn't necessarily a bitter pill. But this program doesn't go very far 
beyond "nice." 
</P>
<P>
Gray even drags out the cliched question that is perpetually asked centenarians 
in small-town newspaper interviews: To what do you attribute your longevity? 
Or, as Gray phrased it, "how did you get this far?" The answers are instantly 
forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Gray and producer/director Lyn Picallo tried to include too many people 
in half an hour; no one has the time to tell a really good story. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the show was shot at the Taper, Too, during Gray's presentation of 
"L.A., the Other, Conversations With . . ." there last year. On stage, Gray 
limited the number of interview subjects to a maximum of five each night. He 
should have followed the same format on television, especially for a 30-minute 
slot.

Then again, there just aren't many people who tell a story as well as Gray does 
in his own monologues. Compared with his more personal pieces, "Old Wise Tales" 
is pure fluff. DON SHIRLEY

DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM THE LIVES OF RENAISSANCE MEN

<P>
As an extension of the J. Paul Getty Museum's energetic collecting of 
high-quality manuscripts, Thomas Kren, the museum's young and keen-eyed curator 
of medieval manuscripts, has put together a show that samples illuminated 
manuscripts and their patrons. "Vie a Mon Desir": Illuminated Manuscripts and 
Their Patrons" continues through July 2. 
</P>
<P>
During the Middle Ages, the major patron for illumination was the church and 
book illustration was restricted to monasteries and ecclesiastic subjects. As 
the renaissance arrived, with all its rich and princely nobles and urban 
centers, patronage was extended to include some of the most powerful and elite 
names in history. Book execution fell from the hands of monks to premier 
artists sought mainly for their skill at illustrating everything from the 
standard prayer books to romantic histories to fencing manuals. (A charming one 
that outlines moves and combatants in black and white contour lines is included 
here.) 
</P>
<P>
The premise behind the show is that these little books present an interesting 
way to delve into the social, political and economic goals of patrons. That's a 
tremendous load to put on a mere 18 delicately painted pages of parchment, 
spectacular as they may be. 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship between the codex and its wealthy sponsor is pretty 
obvious: The richer the person, the finer the artisan and the more tour de 
force the product. As you might expect, powerful and probably somewhat 
egotistic rulers like Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy (whose sponsorship is 
sampled in the very fine "History of Charles Martel") had themselves lauded in 
their manuscripts either by showing their pious acts, close proximity to 
saints, or with their substantial worldly possessions never too far away. 
</P>
<P>
All these subtle and not so subtle prejudices of patron (and sometimes artisan) 
seep into these beautiful creations, but ultimately the show doesn't need a 
thesis to persuade us that it is an excellent, thoughtfully amassed anthology 
of illumination from the 11th to the 16th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibition scores on its variety of hands and its consistent quality. A 
12th-Century New Testament illumination of St. Luke floating in a pure gilt 
field and draped in classical robes shows the regional influence of Byzantine 
mosaics. A jagged, Gothic-ly rendered St. Hedwig, canonized wife of Henry I, 
graces the page of a book ordered by one of the saint's very distant 
descendants, who shows himself in knight's armor with his richly attired wife 
praying at the foot of their famous relative. 
</P>
<P>
Kren aptly titled the show "Vie a Mon Desir" (Life According to My Desire) 
after those words inscribed in a gorgeous book of hours commissioned around 
1455 by Simon de Varie, who shows himself not as his hedonistic motto would 
imply but in pious prayer before a virtuoso rendition of an approving Madonna 
and Child. That these little books served as personal propaganda can't be 
denied; that they are exquisite works of art unto themselves can't be argued 
either.

'I DID ALL I COULD TO HELP MY SON'; 
</P>
<P>
MOTHER ARRESTED UNDER GANG LAW DENIES BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gloria Williams, the South Los Angeles mother who last month became the first 
parent to be arrested under a new state law that holds adults partially 
responsible for the gang-related crimes of their offspring, said that she tried 
discipline and even took a parenting class but was unable to steer her teen-age 
son away from gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I did all I could to help my son," Williams said in her first extensive 
interview since her arrest in late April. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been accused by the Los Angeles city attorney's office of failing 
to "exercise reasonable care, supervision and control" of her 15-year-old son, 
who authorities said was a member of the Crips gang. The arrest was based in 
part on snapshots found in Williams' home, pictures that allegedly depict 
Williams posing with her son's fellow gang members and her other children 
brandishing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview conducted over the weekend, Williams called the prosecutors' 
allegations "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"How could the police know about all the things I have done to try to help my 
son?" asked the petite, soft-spoken woman who works as an assembly line 
supervisor at an electronics plant. "All they see is a bunch of pictures of a 
party and some writing on the wall. They don't see everything my family has 
gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the photographs from family albums that police claim show her 
posing with teen-agers wearing gang colors do not prove that she condoned gang 
activity. Williams repeated earlier statements that the weapons pictured in 
other snapshots were not semiautomatics, but BB guns -- a contention under 
investigation by police. 
</P>
<P>
She said police spoke to her only on the telephone, and never made clear to her 
that she was suspected of committing any crime. The questions, she said, were 
all about the activities of her son, who is in custody, accused of 
participating in the gang rape of a 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Williams said, she never thought to volunteer to police that she 
had enrolled in a "skilled parenting" course that met each week at the 
Community Youth Sports and Art Foundation in the Crenshaw District. She 
received a certificate after completing 30 hours of course work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Participation Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
School officials confirmed her participation in the course. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested at her home April 29, Williams was charged formally two weeks ago with 
violating the parental responsibility law, which was passed by the state 
Legislature last year to combat gang-related crimes. If convicted, she could 
face a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
After her son's arrest, police searched the Williams home and allegedly found, 
in addition to the photographs, one of her children's bedroom walls covered 
with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after William's arrest, Deputy City Atty. Bruce Coplen 
said the evidence "proves without any reasonable doubt that Williams failed as 
a parent" because it showed that she knew about her son's gang affiliation, 
condoned it and may have even participated in his gang. 
</P>
<P>
Williams refused in the interview to discuss details of the charges against her 
son for fear of incriminating her son. 
</P>
<P>
But, wiping tears from her eyes, she insisted: "He is a good boy and we just 
want him home." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and her 20-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son live next door to her 
mother in a working-class neighborhood just west of Crenshaw Boulevard. Her 
15-year-old son, whose name has not been released because of his age, is being 
held at the Eastlake juvenile detention facility awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Dorsey High School, Williams said she moved into the small stucco 
house five years ago after separating from her husband of 17 years. Since then, 
Williams said, she has taken sole responsibility for raising the children. 
</P>
<P>
She said that her teen-age son took the parental separation hard -- and his 
troubles with the law began soon afterward. Police records indicate that over 
the last two years he has been arrested for crimes ranging from burglary to 
grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he was arrested, Williams said, she would "put him on punishment" by 
denying him telephone privileges and his house keys so that he could not leave 
their three-bedroom home without her consent. 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask him, 'What do you want to be? What do you want to do with your 
life?' " she said. "I took away his telephone and did not let him have any 
friends over." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she tried everything from scolding to spanking. "But when kids 
make up their minds to do something, nothing can stop them," she said. With a 
nervous pause, she added: "I hated to spank him because I was afraid that if I 
left a mark on him, I'd be in trouble for child abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that her son needed stricter guidance, she enrolled him last fall 
in a grass-roots alternative education program that provides classes for 
students expelled from high school because of criminal or bad conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors identified it as the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, 
the same facility where she took the parenting course. 
</P>
<P>
Chilton Alphonse, executive director of the foundation, described Williams as a 
naive mother who "did not know how to take control of her son so that he would 
stay out of the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she volunteered to take the weekly skilled parenting course and 
found it "helpful." She said when she heard "other parents talk about their 
kids running away or being sent to jail for drugs . . . I was shocked. I 
thought, 'Gee, my problems aren't that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
But in April, three months after joining the class and just as she was 
preparing for a second marriage, Williams was stunned by successive shocks. 
First came her son's April 27 gang-rape arrest. Police alleged that the 
12-year-old victim was kidnaped from Williams' back yard and was raped by at 
least a dozen gang members over a three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Whole Bunch of Police Cars' 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, she was arrested. "It was about 4 (p.m.) and I was making out 
some checks to pay bills, and getting ready to go pick up my wedding dress," 
Williams recalled. "My daughter yelled that a whole bunch of police cars were 
parked down the street. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came up to my house, I just thought they wanted to search the place 
again," she said. "They put the handcuffs on me and I looked at my (8-year-old) 
son. He just stared at me and I told my mother to take care of my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Williams was charged under a provision of the 1988 Street Terrorism Enforcement 
and Prevention Act. She spent four hours in jail at the Southwest Police 
Station and was released on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Debra Gonzales said police had interviewed Williams about 
her "failure to control" her son before her arrest, adding: "I know she was 
asked whether she knew her son was in a gang and if she realized the 
significance of the graffiti on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gonzales said she was uncertain whether police explained to Williams 
that they were looking for proof that she had tried to control her son. As a 
result, Gonzales acknowledged, the mother may have been hesitant to answer 
officers' questions, fearing that the information might be used against her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly how she was questioned, I wasn't there," Gonzales said. 
If, in fact, "she has made efforts to curb his gang activity, that information 
would certainly be relevant to this case," Gonzales added. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, said it 
appears that authorities failed to thoroughly investigate the facts before 
Williams was charged with parental neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the parental responsibility law "vague and ridiculous," Ripston said 
police and prosecutors "are desperate to try to make this law work, so they 
went out looking for someone to prosecute. They want to show that they are 
trying to do something about (the gang) problem, so they rushed to prosecute 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is to be tried on June 22, said she has considered "quitting my 
job to keep closer watch on my kids, but we could have never made it on 
welfare. . . . If they put me in jail, then what's going to happen to my kids? 
Is that going to solve the problem?"

$18.5-BILLION STATE TRANSIT PROGRAM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiators for the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian agreed Tuesday on an 
$18.5-billion, 10-year transportation improvement program that will require a 
9-cents-a-gallon hike in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a four-hour bargaining session, smiling negotiators said they had 
reached a consensus on all the major issues involved in the politically 
sensitive task of designing a mammoth spending program for upgrading the 
state's highways and transit systems. The plan is contingent upon voters 
significantly altering the state spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no outstanding issues that I think have the potential to scuttle 
this agreement," said Michael Frost, Deukmejian's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for additional spending to reduce urban congestion, 
improve rural roads and highways, enlarge mass transit systems, repair 
deteriorating freeways, complete new road projects delayed by funding shortages 
and even plant trees along urban highways. 
</P>
<P>
It provides for the spending program to be financed by the gas tax increase, a 
substantial hike in truck weight fees and a $3.5-billion bond issue for mass 
transit. The bonds would also have to be approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement represents the culmination of weeks of intense behind-the-scenes 
negotiations between Deukmejian's staff and Democratic and Republican leaders 
from both legislative houses who specialize in transportation matters. It is 
the first of several interwoven spending issues to be resolved by the 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"We now know each other a lot better, and we don't like each other," joked Sen. 
William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). 
</P>
<P>
Other teams of negotiators are still wrestling with proposals to modify the 
state's spending limit and to alter Proposition 98, the voter-approved 
initiative that dictates the amount of state revenue to be allocated to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Without modifications in the spending limit, the state could not spend the 
additional revenue raised by the transportation plan. The changes in 
Proposition 98, while not directly linked to the transportation issue, are 
needed to resolve a political dispute over how the state should spend any 
surplus. Failure to resolve the surplus question could jeopardize the 
transportation plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing has to fit together," said Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But there is strong bipartisan support for the transportation plan, and the 
momentum generated by Tuesday's agreement is expected to provide a powerful 
incentive for lawmakers to come to terms on the other fiscal issues. 
</P>
<P>
Before the transportation plan reaches the voters for final approval, it will 
have to be ratified by the Legislature and the governor. However, Senate and 
Assembly leaders, as well as Deukmejian, have already indicated that they would 
endorse whatever proposal is produced by the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
The only elements of the transportation plan that remain to be worked out, Katz 
said, are proposals to increase truck weight fees and a determination of 
whether proposed modifications to the spending limit should be placed on a 
November, 1989, ballot or a June, 1990, ballot. There was agreement that the 
truck fees would be raised; the only question is how much. 
</P>
<P>
At earlier sessions, the negotiators agreed that the gas tax increase should be 
approved by the Legislature but should not go into effect unless voters endorse 
changes in the spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators said it has not been determined yet exactly how voters will be 
advised that a vote to approve the spending limit changes would also trigger a 
gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are all committed to the fact that the voters know exactly what they're 
voting on . . . that there will be a gas tax increase," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax increase agreed to by the negotiators provides for an immediate 
5-cents-a-gallon hike to be followed by 1-cent increases each year for the 
following four years. California motorists already pay 9 cents a gallon in 
state taxes and another 9 cents in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate recently approved a 10-cent-a-gallon increase and the Assembly a 
5-cent increase that would be gradually increased over the next decade, 
according to a formula based on inflation. Both legislative houses are now 
expected to adopt the 9-cent increase that had been suggested by Deukmejian and 
agreed to by the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators made no determination on specific projects that would be funded 
with the new gas tax revenue. That would be determined by state and local 
officials based on need.

SCRAMBLE BEGINS FOR REP. COELHO'S SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
LIKELY CANDIDATES: 4 ASSEMBLYMEN, A MAYOR, CONGRESSMAN'S AIDE

<P>
The sudden decision of Rep. Tony Coelho to resign from Congress has touched off 
a preliminary scramble for his seat among four San Joaquin Valley assemblymen, 
the mayor of Modesto and a top aide to Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
The contest is shaping up to be an unusually competitive race, with both the 
Republican and Democratic parties vying for the seat in a special election this 
summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Among those seriously considering entering the race are Democratic Assemblymen 
Rusty Areias of Los Banos and Gary A. Condit of Ceres -- two close friends and 
members of the rebel "Gang of Five" who last year unsuccessfully challenged the 
leadership of Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jim Costa of Fresno, a Democrat who chairs the Assembly Water, 
Parks and Wildlife Committee, is almost certain to run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
And a fourth Democrat considering running is Fred Hatfield, 34, who is Coelho's 
chief of staff. If Hatfield decides to run, he will have Coelho's endorsement, 
a spokesman for the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno is considering whether 
to run against Modesto Mayor Carol Whiteside, who quickly announced her 
candidacy on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, the powerful Democratic whip from Merced, stunned Democrats and 
Republicans alike with his announcement Friday that he will resign rather than 
let an investigation into his personal finances embarrass his party. Coelho 
acknowledged earlier this month that he bought a $100,000 "junk bond" 
underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with the help of a $50,000 loan 
that he did not disclose as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho's resignation is effective June 15. When the seat is officially vacant, 
it will be up to Gov. George Deukmejian to call a special election. A spokesman 
for the governor said the primary vote most likely would be held at the end of 
the summer. A general election, if necessary, could be consolidated with local 
elections on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
For all of the elected officials who are considering running, a special 
election has the advantage of coming at a time when they would not have to give 
up their present offices in order to run. As a result, the race is likely to 
remain quite crowded with candidates pursuing ambitions for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to dissuade someone from passing up a free ride," said Costa, 
37, who after 11 years in the Assembly has made no secret of his desire to go 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Valley district includes Modesto and the northern part of the 
city of Fresno. But for the most part it is rural, taking in all or parts of 
Stanislaus, Merced, Mariposa and Fresno counties. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration in the district is about 55% Democratic and 35% Republican. 
But leaders of both parties view the seat as one that either side could win, 
since Democrats are less likely than Republicans to vote. A special election is 
likely to produce an even lower voter turnout, boosting the GOP's chances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Initial Edge 
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats, the 41-year-old Condit would appear initially to have an edge, 
since all of his Assembly district is within the boundaries of the 
congressional district. As an assemblyman, Condit already represents more than 
half the voters of the congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Costa's Assembly district takes in only about a quarter of the 
congressional seat and Areias has an even smaller portion. 
</P>
<P>
Areias, a 39-year-old dairy farmer, is casting himself as the best friend of 
agriculture, which makes up the most important power bloc in the region. "I'm 
the only active agriculturalist on the Democratic side looking at the race," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One Democratic insider suggested that it is to Condit's advantage to have a 
crowded Democratic field, while Costa would fare better if he could take on 
Condit head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
But all three Democratic assemblymen conferred over the long weekend and on 
Tuesday as they weighed whether to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
Among Republicans, the field is less crowded. As an assemblyman, Jones, 39, 
would have an advantage in raising money and building a campaign organization. 
However, his Assembly seat takes in only the rural, southern end of the 
congressional district, giving him little visibility in the more populated 
northern region. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside, 46, the only announced candidate in the race, points out that her 
city of Modesto provides a strong base with more than a quarter of the 
district's population. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the issue is good government," she said, "and I'm not sure it isn't an 
advantage not to have been involved in all that stuff that goes on in 
Sacramento and Washington."

COURT REJECTS CALIFORNIA APPEAL ON DRUG EVIDENCE 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court said Tuesday that California narcotics agents may not use 
drug evidence in court that had been legally seized at Ontario International 
Airport because they failed to get a search warrant before running lab tests on 
the material. 
</P>
<P>
For prosecutors and law enforcement officials, the case provided a classic 
illustration of what is wrong with the so-called "exclusionary rule," which 
bars the use in court of improperly obtained evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The theory behind the exclusionary rule is that the only effective way to 
prevent police from acting illegally is to penalize them when they do. But 
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp contended that narcotics agents at 
the Ontario airport should be permitted to thoroughly search and test the 
contents of a package that has been lawfully seized. 
</P>
<P>
In the case decided Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected without comment Van de 
Kamp's appeal of a ruling by a state appellate court in San Bernardino. The 
state court had held that agents may examine packages that are handed to them 
by airport workers but that they may not do extensive tests on what they are 
given. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush hopes that his crime bill, which he announced this month, will 
make it easier for such evidence to be used in court. The bill would modify the 
exclusionary rule by saying that no evidence would be excluded from court if 
the officers acted in "a reasonably objective belief" that they were complying 
with the law. 
</P>
<P>
The San Bernardino case involved Stephen E. Leichty, a former college student 
from Claremont, who delivered a package to the air freight terminal at the 
Ontario airport in September, 1986. The package aroused the suspicions of the 
cargo supervisor because it smelled of ether. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the package, the supervisor found several Pepsi bottles filled with an 
odd liquid. He notified narcotics agents, who examined the liquid and ran 
several spot tests on it. They suspected that the liquid was methamphetamine, 
an illegal stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tested at Police Lab 
</P>
<P>
To confirm their suspicions, the agents took the package to the crime lab at 
Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. Armed with evidence from the tests, 
agents obtained a search warrant and raided Leichty's apartment in Claremont, 
where they found equipment for making the illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
Leichty pleaded no contest to the drug charges against him and was sentenced to 
120 days in jail. But the state appellate court last year threw out all the 
evidence against Leichty and dismissed the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The judges had no objection to the actions of the cargo supervisor, who as a 
private citizen is not covered by the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures. But they reasoned that the narcotics officers, as 
government agents, violated the Fourth Amendment because they failed to get a 
search warrant before running lab tests on the liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they held, all the evidence in this case (People of California vs. 
Leichty, 88-1666) "is subject to the exclusionary rule." First the state 
Supreme Court and now the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Van de Kamp's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a second case from Southern California, the justices told the 
federal appellate court in Pasadena to take another look at a $152,000 verdict 
against Los Angeles County growing out of a jail-cell suicide (Cabrales vs. 
County of Los Angeles, 88-1581). 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a jury concluded that the county failed to provide adequate 
psychiatric care to inmate Sergio Cabrales and therefore was responsible for 
his death. Cabrales, who was awaiting trial on a burglary charge, tried to kill 
himself once in December, 1983. On four occasions, he was interviewed by jail 
psychiatrists, who concluded that he was not suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hanged Himself 
</P>
<P>
But after a fight in which he stabbed another inmate, Cabrales was put in an 
isolation unit, where he hanged himself on Jan. 3, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict against Los Angeles 
County in favor of the inmate's mother, Josephina. The "medical understaffing" 
at the Men's Central Jail amounted to a county policy of "deliberate 
indifference" to the health and welfare of inmates, the appeals court reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on an appeal by county lawyers Tuesday, the Supreme Court on a 7-2 vote 
told the appellate judges to restudy their conclusion based on a February 
ruling in which the justices tried to clarify the meaning of "deliberate 
indifference" by city officials.

JUDGE SAYS HE LACKS AUTHORITY TO PREVENT REOPENING OF FUEL LINE 
</P>

<P>
A Superior Court judge Tuesday rejected a bid by San Bernardino officials to 
block the reopening of a gasoline pipeline that ruptured and sparked a deadly 
fuel fire here last week, concluding that he lacked jurisdiction to issue the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Judge Ben Kayashima means the Calnev Pipe Line Co. may resume 
pumping gasoline through the ravaged Muscoy neighborhood in west San Bernardino 
as soon as repairs to the line are completed and approved by federal 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we get the green light, we'll flip the switch," said Charles Diamond, an 
attorney representing Calnev. Diamond said pumping on the line, which serves 
Las Vegas and several Air Force bases, could resume within the week. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the judge's decision was swift and angry among the dozen residents 
who attended the afternoon hearing. Some left the courtroom in tears while 
others accused pipeline company officials of placing their wallets ahead of 
their concern for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"How can this be? How can this be?" Ruby Self, a 26-year resident of the 
devastated neighborhood, murmured repeatedly after the hearing. "The powers 
that be are more concerned about gasoline than about the lives of citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Like others displaced by the fire and a derailed train that flattened a row of 
homes just two weeks earlier, Elizabeth Courtney complained bitterly that she 
and her neighbors were being mistreated because of their low-income status. 
</P>
<P>
"If this were Beverly Hills, you know they would shut down that line," Courtney 
said. "But since it's just us working people, they figure they can just run the 
gas on through again." 
</P>
<P>
City officials vowed to carry on their legal battle and to be back in court 
June 14 seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the pumping pending further 
litigation. But they concede the odds that they will prevail are slim. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a heck of a quandary," City Atty. James Penman said. "But we have to 
keep fighting because no one will give us assurances that it is safe for our 
citizens to return. So what do we do? Keep them out? Where do they go?" 
</P>
<P>
The 14-inch steel fuel line, which parallels the railroad tracks along Duffy 
Street and lies four feet underground, ruptured Thursday morning, dousing 
surrounding homes in a shower of flaming fuel. Two people were killed and 31 
injured in the inferno, and 15 homes were destroyed or damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The eruption occurred 13 days after a runaway Southern Pacific train derailed 
at a curve, killing two trainmen and two children and burying a block of homes 
in a pile of twisted steel and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating both incidents. Among 
the key questions is whether the freight train damaged or weakened the gasoline 
line, making it vulnerable to the high pressure needed to pump 2.7 million 
gallons over Cajon Pass each day. 
</P>
<P>
The city has asked the company to relocate the line to the west side of the 
railroad tracks. The realignment would place a 20-foot-high embankment between 
the fuel pipe and homes, but Calnev officials have said the relocation would 
cause a lengthy interruption of service. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the line was initially adjudicated to be safe in its 
current location, and there is no reason to move it," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
In court Tuesday, San Bernardino Assistant City Atty. Diane Brue argued that 
the city would suffer irreparable harm if pumping resumed and asked for court 
intervention to ensure that Calnev officials complied with safety standards in 
repairing the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Kayashima ruled that the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 
-- a federal law -- denied the state authority in such matters and preempted 
him from intervening. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who attended the hearing were in no mood to listen to the jurist's 
legal reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"How can they do this to us?" said a trembling Mary Madrid, who raised five 
children in her Adams Street home and has been prescribed tranquilizers to deal 
with stress from the fire. "They say the people in Las Vegas need gasoline. 
Well, how about us? We lost our homes, our babies, and now they want to start 
that pipeline running again. It's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Although San Bernardino fire officials have told 30 families on the outskirts 
of the charred neighborhood that they can return home, only 13 had chosen to do 
so by midday Tuesday. The remaining 150 or so families are scattered in motels 
around the Inland Empire, uncertain of their fate. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Stacker has been living with his family at the Victory Motel since 
Thursday. His wife is shaken and cries easily these days, and his children toss 
and turn and talk in their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"We have four kids under 12, and we're all piled into this motel room," Stacker 
said. "My 10-year-old daughter is talking in her sleep, saying, 'Get out! Get 
out!' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take them back in there. It's not safe."

SENATE BUDGET PANEL USES WINDFALL TO PAY FOR PARED PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Helped by an unexpected $2.5-billion revenue windfall, the Senate Budget and 
Fiscal Review Committee agreed on a nearly $50-billion state budget Tuesday, 
voting to spend nearly all of the new money on programs recommended for 
cutbacks by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan, passed on an 11-0 vote, is conditioned on the satisfactory 
conclusion of negotiations under way between the governor and legislative 
leaders on a variety of complex budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
The committee-approved budget cannot be implemented unless Deukmejian and 
leaders of the Assembly and Senate, who have been negotiating in private for 
weeks, reach an agreement in the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding problem facing Deukmejian and legislative budget writers is that 
the state is prevented from spending the bulk of the tax windfall because of a 
constitutional limit on government spending approved by voters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be agreement quickly on a revenue plan that will support the 
budget," said Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), the committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Alquist and the Republican and Democratic budget writers who 
sit on his committee showed that they have been listening to their 
constituents. Under intense pressure from mental health groups, hospital and 
medical associations, county governments and others to restore the cuts 
proposed by Deukmejian, the legislators did just that. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended cuts were contained in the $47-billion proposed budget that 
Deukmejian sent the Legislature in January. The governor's budget did not 
anticipate the $2.5-billion revenue windfall that state finance officials say 
has developed because of stronger-than-expected income tax payments from 
individuals and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the proposed new spending in the committee-approved budget -- 
nearly $1.5 billion of the $2.2 billion that Senate lawmakers want to add to 
the governor's budget -- is in health and human services programs. 
</P>
<P>
Alquist said most of the programs have "been underfunded for many years." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget proposals generally fared badly, but that was especially so 
in the $27-billion health and human services portion of the proposed 
$49.7-billion budget put together by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the committee rejected the Deukmejian plan to make up for cuts 
he proposed in various health programs by using new tobacco tax revenues 
generated by Proposition 99. The committee voted to ignore the governor's 
proposed cuts and spend $400 million more than he wanted on the programs. It 
decided to spend the tobacco tax revenues on a variety of other health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
A budget subcommittee headed by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) earlier voted 
to increase the amount going to immigrant education programs by $100 million 
over the amount proposed by Deukmejian. The subcommittee also voted to augment 
county health programs for the working poor by $70 million, and it recommended 
the complete restoration of the $34.6-million budget of the Office of Family 
Planning, which administers grants to local agencies that dispense birth 
control and other information to the public. Deukmejian wants to abolish the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's version of the budget also restores $232.9 million to provide 
4.6% increases in basic food and housing payments to welfare recipients and 
aged, blind and disabled persons receiving supplemental income assistance from 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
And the proposed spending plan would add $97 million to state-supported 
research, treatment and education programs to combat AIDS, increase spending on 
mental health programs by $180 million, and provide an extra $140 million to 
county Medi-Cal programs. Homes providing foster care would also receive a 
budget increase of $25 million, enough to increase their allotments from the 
state by 4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Since the recent surprise discovery of the extra tax revenues, Deukmejian 
Admininstration officials have indicated that the governor may be willing to 
back away from some of his more severe budget cuts. But they have made it clear 
that future decisions are directly linked to the negotiations under way between 
Deukmejian and leaders of the Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Proposed Changes 
</P>
<P>
On the bargaining table are proposed changes to the voter-approved cap on state 
spending; possible amendments to Proposition 98, the landmark initiative that 
guarantees public schools and community colleges a fixed share of the state 
budget, and a proposal to raise $20 billion over the next 10 years for 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Since the state is operating at near the legal spending limit, it does not have 
the authority to spend the bulk of the windfall money on general state 
programs. Law requires that surplus revenues either be given to public schools 
or rebated to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action sets up the final phase of budget deliberations that will 
lead to approval of a budget for the new fiscal year that begins July 1. The 
full Senate is scheduled to vote on the budget Thursday. The Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee will complete its version of the budget today, and a floor vote 
by the full house probably will be taken next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Differences between the two versions of the budget will be hammered out by a 
conference committee that will begin deliberations during the middle of next 
week. The Legislature has until June 15 to complete its work on the budget, but 
it has missed its deadline five of the last eight years.

HONG KONG MOVES 350 VIETNAM REFUGEES TO BARREN ISLAND

The government of Hong Kong, saying its resources for housing Vietnamese "boat 
people" have been overwhelmed, moved 350 men, women and children Tuesday to an 
island with only basic rations and no shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese, the latest of the 2,300 "boat people" who have arrived in the 
British colony over the past three days, were taken by police launch and left 
under guard on Tai A Chau, the main island in the Soko group, about 18 miles 
southwest of Hong Kong Island. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be provided with food and water, but we are not able to provide them 
with shelter," said government refugee coordinator Mike Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply have no accommodation left. I think it is important that people in 
the camps and in the northern part of Vietnam understand that we have no 
accommodation for 'boat people,' " Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said any new arrivals would be towed out to the Sokos if their boats 
were seaworthy but would have the option of continuing their voyage if they 
wished. 
</P>
<P>
The Sokos, among Hong Kong's 236 islands, are inhabited by only one elderly 
Chinese couple. There is no running water and no facilities except for a 
run-down former school. 
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 38,000 Vietnamese "boat people" jammed into Hong Kong's 
camps, prisons and detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
About 24,000 of them are regarded as illegal immigrants. They are ones who 
arrived since last June, when Hong Kong introduced a policy that classifies 
incoming "boat people" as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless 
they can prove they are genuine refugees fleeing political persecution.

10 DEAD AS ARGENTINE FOOD RIOTS SPREAD; 
</P>
<P>
1,600 LOOTERS DETAINED AS EXPLOSION OF UNREST AFFECTS 12 CITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Food riots spread to more than a dozen Argentine cities and towns Tuesday, 
engulfing the vast industrial belt around Buenos Aires and leaving at least 10 
dead in an explosion of anger over hyperinflation. 
</P>
<P>
Five bombs went off in the capital, causing little damage but further jangling 
nerves as President Raul Alfonsin's lame-duck government groped to rein in the 
chaotic economy and restore order. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,600 looters were detained under state-of-siege powers imposed 
Monday night, including 1,000 in Rosario, Argentina's second-largest city, 
about 165 miles northwest of the capital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of supermarkets and other stores were ransacked in working-class 
suburbs and squatter towns, mainly around Buenos Aires and Rosario, and 
hundreds of looters were injured in running battles with police firing 
handguns, rubber bullets and tear-gas grenades. 
</P>
<P>
The pillaging tested Alfonsin's resolve to see his term through its December 
finish and thus preside over the first constitutional transition of power from 
one party to another in Argentina's history. The largest trade union 
confederation joined a range of sectors in demanding that Alfonsin step down 
and allow the Peronist president-elect, Carlos Saul Menem, to assume office 
early. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, the La Rioja province governor who won a landslide victory May 14, 
appealed for calm and made clear he was in no hurry to step in. "We are all 
worried by this situation, and I ask understanding and support from the 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The government insisted that ultra-left agitators were stirring up the poor to 
break into shops and steal goods, including appliances and furniture, as well 
as food. But leftist politicians and many residents themselves scoffed at that 
explanation as an excuse to deflect attention from the desperation and hunger 
brought on by the government's repeated economic failures, culminating in an 
unprecedented burst of inflation -- about 70% for the month of May alone. 
</P>
<P>
Police officer Jorge Garcia, who was in charge of 30 to 40 officers guarding a 
large supermarket barricaded with upturned chairs and pallets, said: "It's a 
mix of reasons. There are needs, but it is also organized. If there was no 
need, the agitators wouldn't have fertile ground to sow problems." 
</P>
<P>
The death toll rose to six in Rosario, including a store owner who shot himself 
as looters ransacked his shelves. Severe rioting had broken out before dawn 
Monday and it resumed Tuesday. The looting spread to nearby Villa Gobernador 
Galvez, where Mayor Santos Mauro said, "They left practically nothing, they 
stripped everything -- supermarkets, stores, shoe shops." 
</P>
<P>
In greater Buenos Aires, home to one-third of the nation's 31 million people, 
at least 11 towns suffered waves of sackings. 
</P>
<P>
San Miguel, a city of about 300,000 people northwest of the capital, counted 
four dead as poor residents burst out of their squatter and working-class 
neighborhoods and ransacked and destroyed shops along a half-mile-long avenue. 
Military helicopters clattered overhead and police vans roamed the street, 
firing in the air and shooting tear gas and rubber bullets at groups of 
looters. 
</P>
<P>
Police traded fire with a young man and captured him in an alley, dragging him 
away to a squad car, one of several reported cases of gunfights between 
civilians and police in different clashes. 
</P>
<P>
The principal target in more than 18 hours of looting in the area was a 
wholesale food warehouse, in which the crowd stripped nearly bare dozens of 
racks full of food. Police fired tear gas into the warehouse, driving out the 
looters, who left a trail of broken jars of olives, mayonnaise, noodles and 
grape juice. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the street, the mobs smashed windows and tore open the metal 
shutters of small stores selling products ranging from furniture to food. 
Although police reinforcements were brought in from several towns, the patrols 
took little action, reluctant to cause further casualties. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much hunger here, the people are earning the equivalent of $18 to $20 
a month," said a civil defense worker who was tending to the wounded. "They are 
mostly mothers with children. They didn't throw anything. They want sugar and 
milk, some are even asking the police to let them pass." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase in Minimum Wage 
</P>
<P>
The government announced a 117% increase in the minimum wage Tuesday, to 8,700 
australs a month; that equalled only about $43 because of the collapse of the 
austral against the dollar since February. However, increasing numbers of 
workers complained their pay is below the minimum wage. Stella Maris de Varias, 
a 38-year-old mother of six from the Barrio San Isidro housing project in 
suburban Buenos Aires, said her husband, a metal shop worker, earned 20 
australs an hour, or $16 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The government also imposed ceiling prices for bread, sugar and flour that are 
below the current selling prices. 
</P>
<P>
In a new program of monitoring price increases, government inspectors ordered 
seven major companies to close for 24 hours for overcharging. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was unclear whether such measures would calm widespread anger over lost 
buying power and the emergence of real hunger in Argentina, a major beef and 
grain exporter. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Carmen Herrera, standing outside a supermarket in San Miguel that had 
been sacked Monday, said she worked as a maid for 100 australs -- about 50 
cents -- for four hours' work. Another woman shouted over her shoulder: "She 
works four hours to buy a two-pound bag of sugar!" 
</P>
<P>
Stores throughout greater Buenos Aires and Rosario closed two hours early. Food 
markets rationed purchases to no more than two of any item. 
</P>
<P>
With banks limiting withdrawals to just over $100 a person per week, many 
Argentines are desperately low on cash and many don't know how they will pay 
their employees, rent and other end-of-the-month accounts. Currency exchange 
houses have remained closed because of a lack of australs.

The head of the elite Colombian intelligence agency that probes the country's 
powerful drug gangs survived a car bomb explosion Tuesday that killed four 
people and injured 38, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Four vehicles -- two belonging to bodyguards of intelligence chief Miguel Maza 
Marquez and two private cars -- were destroyed in the explosion, which also 
shattered the windows of buildings in the area, witnesses said. Maza Marquez 
was traveling with bodyguards in a bulletproof car when the bomb exploded in a 
parked car on a main street. He was only slightly hurt, although several of his 
bodyguards were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a street in Beirut," an unidentified witness told a local radio 
station. Another witness said 10 children were injured as they were awaiting a 
school bus. 
</P>
<P>
Maza Marquez, the fifth-ranking police officer in Colombia, is head of the 
government's top intelligence organization, known as the Department of 
Administrative Security. It investigates narcotics cases, right-wing

Anonymous telephone callers to Radio Cadena Nacional radio station said the 
attack was "made in Medellin," apparently indicating it was plotted by drug 
traffickers in Colombia's second-largest city -- the home of one of the largest 
cocaine rings in the world.

The director of public prosecutions said Tuesday that he has decided against 
prosecuting subway officials for an escalator fire that killed 31 people.

Allan Green, in charge of prosecutions brought by the police, said he has 
insufficient evidence to bring charges of manslaughter or endangering life by

An official report blamed executive complacency and an untrained staff response 
for the Nov. 18, 1987, fire that erupted in busy King's Cross station during

Wu, a physician and viewer from afar of China's student democracy movement, 
listened with amusement Tuesday to a description of the "Goddess of Democracy" 
statue that students have erected in Beijing's main square. 
</P>
<P>
As the visitor's tale ended, Wu moved to switch on the nightly national news on 
television broadcast from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doubtful," he said as a map of China appeared on the screen. "That kind 
of thing probably won't be shown." 
</P>
<P>
Wu's doubts were well founded, for a brief opening of the window of China's 
televised news has been shut. On Tuesday's broadcast, no crowds in Tian An Men 
Square were shown, nor was the raising of the enormous statue clutching a 
torch, looking somewhat like the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor. No 
fresh-faced students pleaded that their message be carried forth to all corners 
of the land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stories on Troops, Dam 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there was a report on troops camped on the outskirts of Beijing -- 
they were shown goose-stepping for a visiting Communist party dignitary; a 
story about the building of a dam -- plenty of pictures of earth movers moving 
earth; and one about the return of a young acrobatics team from a triumphant 
tour of Italy -- scenes of kids balancing trays piled high with champagne 
glasses on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, maybe last week they would have shown it, but not now," said Wu, sighing 
and flicking off the set. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between last week and this is the apparent strengthening of 
hard-line leaders in Beijing in their battle with political reformers, led by 
the embattled Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Chinese government television, called CCTV, offered lively accounts 
of the turbulence in Beijing. It was perhaps the first time under Communist 
rule that television gave freewheeling coverage to any controversial domestic 
event. 
</P>
<P>
The venture into uncensored TV was not to last. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Beijing say that Premier Li Peng, the conservative who appears to 
be coming out on top in the power struggle in the party's top ranks, has 
handpicked a five-member committee to watch for transgressions in the press and 
on television. The committee takes over from Hu Qili, the party's propaganda 
chief and a close associate of Zhao who has probably lost his seat on the 
ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Hu had not been known generally as one who gave television news free rein. But 
as the struggle in Beijing developed, half a billion potential viewers were 
treated to a rare, clear account of Chinese events. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of a week, CCTV carried several dramatic moments of the 
student movement. 
</P>
<P>
There was the May 18 confrontation between student leaders and Li. Students had 
demanded that Li not only meet with them but that the proceedings be televised. 
They were, and the students took every advantage. 
</P>
<P>
They accused Li of talking around their demand for greater democracy. The 
cameras made the 60-year-old premier look doddering and jowly. Some students 
who were on a hunger strike looked valiant and long-suffering. One wore a 
hospital cloak and fainted at the end of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Li appeared again on television the next day, this time among people more his 
age. He was shown in the Great Hall of the People making a speech to party 
functionaries, some of whom appeared to be propped up by their heavy Mao 
jackets. Li then disappeared from view for a few days, replaced by messages 
read into the camera or flashed on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a moment of unfettered reporting, a TV journalist interviewed a 
soldier on the street who admitted that his troops could not enter the city 
because of barricades put up by the demonstrating students and the masses of 
citizens blocking their way. 
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, we feel very embarrassed," the officer admitted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Shown Greeting Envoys 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last Thursday, Li appeared once more, but this time in the ritualized 
role of a leader in charge: He greeted ambassadors from other countries, 
telling them that all China is tranquil. 
</P>
<P>
Television also slipped into a ritualized role. The news broadcasts returned to 
their previous pat manner. Several opened with written messages from government 
organizations urging the students to give up. 
</P>
<P>
While other cities and provinces have no alternative to the official view, 
television viewers in Hong Kong do, and some residents of this southern city 
can pick up their news from there. Only 75 miles away, Hong Kong beams its own 
news programs here, along with a dominant fare of soap operas, American-made 
sitcoms and sexy swimwear ads. 
</P>
<P>
For good reception, the Cantonese put up antennas that are nicknamed "fish 
bones" because of their shape. Recently, the provincial government urged 
viewers to abandon Hong Kong television because of its immoral tendencies, but 
a look at the fish bone-rich Canton skyline suggests that hardly anyone took 
the advice seriously. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Silly' to Restrict News 
</P>
<P>
"To us it seems silly for the government to restrict news. We can get all we 
want from Hong Kong," said Wu. He added that he sympathizes with the students 
but has taken no part in the few demonstrations that have occurred in Canton. 
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong news opened not only with a report on the "Goddess of Democracy" 
but also with news that police in Beijing may have rounded up several union 
activists in secret arrests. Wu did not switch back to CCTV after the news but 
kept on watching the Hong Kong channel, where "The Graduate," starring Dustin 
Hoffman, was set to play.

JUSTICES RULE AGAINST EX-MILITARY WIVES; 
</P>
<P>
HOLD DIVORCED HUSBANDS DO NOT HAVE TO SHARE DISABILITY PAY

<P>
In a setback for the former spouses of military personnel, the Supreme Court 
ruled Tuesday that a retired serviceman may keep his disability pay for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 ruling overturns a California court order requiring that all military 
retirement pay be split evenly when a couple divorces. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers say that the high court ruling could reopen thousands of divorce cases 
involving retired servicemen who get disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prayers Banned 
</P>
<P>
Also, the justices let stand a ruling that a public high school in Georgia may 
not begin its football games with a religious invocation. An appellate court in 
Atlanta said last year that such invocations are unconstitutional because they 
endorse religion (Douglas County School District vs. Jager, 88-1610). 
</P>
<P>
In the military retirement case, the justices based their decision on a 1982 
law called the Former Spouses Protection Act. In 1981, the high court in a much 
criticized ruling, also in a California case, had said that federal law did not 
permit ex-wives to get an equal share of their husband's military retirement 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
In the hastily enacted 1982 measure, Congress sought to overturn that finding 
by declaring that divorcees in states such as California are entitled to half 
of their husband's "disposable retired" income from the military. But the law 
defined "disposable" income in a way that excludes disability pay received from 
the Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall said that the 1982 law's "plain and precise language" 
does not permit a state judge to order that a serviceman's disability pay be 
split evenly between the husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that reading the statute literally may inflict economic harm on 
many former spouses," Marshall added. "But we decline to misread the statute in 
order to reach a sympathetic result." He concluded by inviting Congress to 
rewrite the law. 
</P>
<P>
The NOW Legal Defense Fund agreed with Marshall that the law needs to be 
rewritten but assailed the court for a "rigid statutory interpretation (that) 
strikes a cruel blow" at divorced military spouses. 
</P>
<P>
This case grew out of the 1979 divorce of retired Air Force Maj. Gerald Mansell 
and his wife, Gaye, who separated after 25 years of marriage and six children. 
In a divorce decree signed in a Merced court, Mansell initially agreed to pay 
his wife half of his $1,682 total monthly military retirement pay, or $841 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
However, the former bomber pilot opted to receive $482 of his pay as disability 
income from the Veterans Administration. Under the military retirement system, 
there is a ceiling on a retiree's total income, but, to take advantage of tax 
breaks, an ex-serviceman who is entitled to receive disability pay may opt to 
receive part of the total in that form. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Mansell sought to have the divorce decree rewritten to exclude the 
$482 in disability pay from his total income. Two California courts rejected 
his request, citing the state's community property policy, under which property 
gained during a marriage is to be split evenly in a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
However, the high court said that California's law is preempted by the federal 
law in this instance. As a result, the former Mrs. Mansell will receive only 
half of her husband's $1,200 "disposable retired" income, or $600 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who as a young wife followed her husband to West 
Germany, where he was stationed in the Army, dissented sharply and accused the 
majority of missing the forest for the trees.

NOT TARGET OF FBI PROBE, REP. GRAY SAYS

Rep. William H. Gray III, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus and the 
highest ranking black member of Congress, said Tuesday that he was questioned 
here by FBI agents over the Memorial Day holiday but termed "an outrageous lie" 
a report that he is the subject of a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News quoted unidentified Justice Department sources as saying that the 
Pennsylvania Democrat had refused to cooperate when two FBI agents contacted 
him over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provided No Names 
</P>
<P>
However, Gray told a news conference that the agents had told him only that "an 
employee or employees" of his office were suspected of wrongdoing but the 
agents refused to provide names or describe the allegations against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told over and over again that I was not the target or the subject of the 
investigation," Gray added. 
</P>
<P>
The agents' assurances, he said, were confirmed by a Tom Lee from the U.S. 
attorney's office in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz refused to comment, saying: "Our 
official position on this is that we are not confirming or denying the 
existence of any investigation." 
</P>
<P>
(Later Tuesday night, the Associated Press quoted anonymous government sources 
as confirming the CBS report that the FBI was conducting a preliminary inquiry 
into allegations regarding personnel and expenditures in the congressman's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
(One source told the wire service there were allegations that a no-show 
employee was being kept on Gray's payroll. The source stressed, however, that 
the FBI's inquiry was at this point preliminary and agents did not know whether 
it would lead to a full-scale criminal investigation.) 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who is seeking to become the majority whip, the third-ranking House post, 
replacing retiring Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), said that he was suspicious 
about the timing of the story during his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he would demand an immediate investigation by Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh of "inaccurate leaks" to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he is still a candidate for whip, Gray replied: "You bet I am!" 
</P>
<P>
Then, reiterating his offer to cooperate with an inquiry and provide records or 
documents, he added: 
</P>
<P>
"I have done nothing wrong. I have nothing to fear from an investigation . . . 
. I'm not aware of any improprieties and I don't tolerate any improprieties." 
</P>
<P>
Gray questioned the timing of the investigators' visit also. He said that the 
agents told him they had had the information for four or five months. 
</P>
<P>
"Why wait four months to send them to my home on Memorial Day?" Gray asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it interesting -- I find it amazing -- that no one can answer questions 
about this. 
</P>
<P>
"You be the judge as to the Justice Department leaks," he suggested to 
reporters. "It may sound amazing that this could happen in America."

TEXAS ALLY SAYS WRIGHT PLANS TO QUIT THIS WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKER GIVES NO HINT OF NEXT MOVE BUT FELLOW DEMOCRATS SAY OPENLY HE MUST 
LEAVE POST SOON

<P>
One of House Speaker Jim Wright's most stalwart Texas allies said Tuesday that 
he expects the Speaker to resign from Congress this week because of "blowtorch" 
political pressure from his Democratic Party colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) said that Friday's unexpected decision by Rep. 
Tony Coelho (D-Merced), the majority whip, to quit the House rather than face 
an ethical ordeal has put additional pressure on Wright to leave instead of 
fighting ethics charges himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Democrat, however, returned from a weekend in seclusion without 
announcing any decision on his plans. Another close home-state supporter, Rep. 
Martin Frost (D-Tex.), said that Wright told him he is still considering "a 
range of options" that presumably include choices other than resigning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Losing Patience 
</P>
<P>
Even so, fellow Democrats are losing patience with the Speaker and began to say 
more openly that he must go soon to spare the House and the Democratic Party 
from any more damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope the Speaker would take a good, hard look at what Coelho did," 
said Rep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.). "I think it's in the best interests of this 
institution and the best interests of the Democratic Party to get this mess 
behind us. Regrettably, that involves the resignation of the Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent House Democrat, who asked not to be identified, added: 
"Wright's going to have to go. If he doesn't, then we'll get a delegation 
together to go visit him and tell him he has to go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awaits Panel Ruling 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker, talking briefly to reporters, said that he is awaiting a ruling by 
the House Ethics Committee on motions to dismiss major charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
While he indicated that he has largely made up his mind on his next move, 
Wright gave no hint about what it is. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which is scheduled to meet Thursday, is regarded as likely to reject 
Wright's legal challenge to the case against him. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.), the ranking GOP member of the panel, 
said that there is a possibility the committee might vote to conduct a 
preliminary inquiry into two additional areas at its session this week, thus 
expanding the year-old investigation of Wright's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Wright said that he would have a statement on his plans later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want to Be Fair' 
</P>
<P>
"I think I know what I should do," he said. "I think I know what I believe to 
be in my best interests and the interests of the institution. I want to be fair 
to myself, my family, my reputation, and I want to be fair to this institution 
that I've served for 34 years." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson asserted that Wright is getting a "bum deal" because the charges 
alleging 69 violations of House rules were brought and would be judged by the 
same 12 members of the Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wilson added, the fellow Democrats urging the Speaker to resign 
are motivated by the adverse political fallout generated by the case. 
</P>
<P>
"He's being judged by a jury that's under enormous political pressure," Wilson 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the jockeying for leadership posts grew more frenetic Tuesday with 
most House members assuming that Wright will leave soon and be replaced by 
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gephardt Seen Leading 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), a former presidential candidate, appeared to 
have a lock on Foley's job, according to many Democratic insiders. 
</P>
<P>
In a hot contest for Coelho's No. 3 job as party whip, Rep. William H. Gray III 
(D-Pa.) and Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) are off to a fast start, along with 
Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) jumped into the scramble Monday -- a day 
after his probable opponents -- but his supporters said that he has a good 
chance of victory. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-member California Democratic delegation backs Waxman, as do some others 
who got campaign help from him, his supporters argued. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) announced that she 
will run for chairman of the Democratic Caucus if Gray, the incumbent, wins the 
whip race and vacates that post. 
</P>
<P>
Kennelly would face Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and, if she won, would become 
the highest-ranking woman in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who startled his colleagues by announcing Friday that he would resign 
June 15 to prevent a prolonged investigation of his $100,000 investment in a 
junk bond with the aid of a savings and loan official, said in a Fresno 
television interview that he had planned to leave Congress at the end of the 
second session in 1990 even before the controversy over the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and his wife, Phyllis, decided last winter that it was time for 
him to leave public service and seek a higher-paying career in private life at 
a time when his two teen-aged daughters are finishing high school and preparing 
to enter college.

WOMAN TIED TO JUDGE IN INQUIRY INDICTED 
</P>

<P>
A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted a woman who is believed to be an 
important witness in a racketeering case that the Justice Department is 
building against a federal judge in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Vera L. Hoff, a former lawyer and friend of U.S. District Judge Robert P. 
Aguilar, was charged in a three-count indictment in connection with fleeing the 
country to avoid serving a two-year sentence for a 1978 conviction on income 
tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities learned that Hoff was living in Mexico during their 
investigation of Aguilar, 58. With the help of Mexican authorities, she was 
arrested in Texas on March 20 and has been held at the federal prison in 
Pleasanton there. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the investigation of Aguilar, the FBI and prosecutors from the 
Justice Department's Public Integrity Section are looking into whether the 
judge assisted Hoff either in her escape or during her years as a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accuses Hoff, who is in her early 70s, of contempt of court, 
obstruction of justice, and failure to appear. The indictment makes no mention 
of others who may have assisted her when she was a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case say Aguilar, one of three full-time judges assigned 
to the federal court in San Jose, is likely to be indicted in June. The 
investigation has been going on for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is outrageous, particularly the obstruction count," said Randy Sue 
Pollock, a San Francisco attorney who is representing Hoff. "They are trying to 
push her, and maximize the pressure on her so she cooperates against Aguilar." 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said Hoff was "willing to cooperate with the government," but added 
that the terms of her cooperation were "not resolved, and this is how they 
retaliated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer of Deed 
</P>
<P>
She said Hoff was not aware that she would be charged with three counts. 
Because of the seriousness of the case, Pollock added, it is "very possible" 
that Hoff will opt against helping in the investigation of the federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
When he was an attorney in the 1960s, Aguilar employed Hoff as a legal 
secretary. Later, he helped to represent Hoff in a tax evasion case. In 
December, 1979, shortly after Aguilar became a Santa Clara County Superior 
Court judge, Hoff transferred ownership of her San Jose home to him. 
</P>
<P>
As a state judge, Aguilar had urged a federal judge handling Hoff's case to 
allow her to travel to Germany to visit her sick mother, court records show. 
Hoff fled from California in 1980 when she lost her case on appeal and faced 
having to report for her imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar was confirmed to the federal bench in June, 1980. In 1982, Aguilar 
recorded a deed in Santa Clara County showing himself as the owner of what had 
been Hoff's home. The following year, Aguilar sold the house to a friend and 
former client of Hoff. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Hoff matter, authorities are looking into circumstances 
surrounding a $12,000 loan that Aguilar received in 1983, while he was a 
federal judge, from a former casino owner who later was convicted in a bank 
swindle. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, investigators believe that Aguilar last year unsuccessfully tried 
to influence a fellow member of the bench who was considering whether to revoke 
the probation of former San Francisco Teamster leader Michael Rudy Tham. 
</P>
<P>
Tham, whose probation was revoked, is serving a five-year sentence. He 
originally was convicted of embezzling $2,000 in union funds to entertain 
mobster-turned-informant Aladena (Jimmy the Weasel) Fratianno.

ATTORNEY FOR SAILOR ASSAILS IOWA INQUIRY AS A 'SMEAR' 
</P>

Denouncing the Navy's investigation of an explosion that killed 47 sailors 
aboard the battleship Iowa as a "smear" campaign against Gunner's Mate 3rd 
Class Kendall L. Truitt, Miami attorney Ellis Rubin charged Tuesday that 
investigators are paying scant attention to more plausible explanations for the 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy confirmed last week that it is investigating whether the personal 
relationship between Truitt and another member of the crew could have been a 
factor in the explosion. Truitt was listed as the beneficiary of a $100,000 
life insurance policy purchased by the other crewman, Gunner's Mate 2nd Class 
Clayton M. Hartwig, who died in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
In defending Truitt, Rubin pointed to what he said was the presence of 
inexperienced crewmen in the gun turret that exploded and the possibility that 
gunpowder loaded into the turret's big gun may have become unstable because of 
faulty storage. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people assigned specific tasks (in the affected turret) were not 
qualified," said Rubin, who is representing Truitt against possible criminal 
charges arising from the Navy investigation. "Many were last-minute 
substitutes," Rubin added, creating a turret crew that had never worked 
together as a team. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin also contested the Navy's claim that the storage of gunpowder in 
overheated ships could not have contributed to the accident. Citing two 
engineers with expertise in explosives, Rubin said that after such improper 
storage, "the gunpowder was so volatile and unstable that anything could have 
happened. And it probably did." 
</P>
<P>
As Truitt and his wife of five months held hands and occasionally kissed behind 
him, Rubin demanded that the Navy publicly apologize to his client. He said 
that Truitt is exploring an unprecedented suit against the Navy for disclosing 
preliminary details of the inquiry, which suggested that the 21-year-old 
gunner's mate was homosexual.

ASIANS BEGINNING TO BELIEVE POLICE ARE THE GOOD GUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, no one came to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder. Acceptance of police does not come easily for people who have 
witnessed corruption and brutality among law enforcement in their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cambodian, Hmong, Lao and Vietnamese community service officers hired 
by the San Diego Police Department in 1987 to open a Euclid Avenue storefront 
office say the Indochinese community is finally beginning to trust the police. 
</P>
<P>
Next week marks the two-year anniversary for the community service officers, 
who say the community now accepts them, calling for help and providing tips to 
other crimes in the area as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contacts on the Rise 
</P>
<P>
During the storefront's first month in 1987, there were 49 walk-in cases and 85 
phone calls. Last month, there were 212 visits and 633 calls. The staff now 
receives about five crime reports a day, 
</P>
<P>
up from three to five crime reports a week two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
These days, residents bring fried shrimp, Cambodian pickles and exotic seafoods 
to the officers. Rape -- traditionally taboo to even mention in Indochinese 
cultures -- is now being reported by residents, and parents are calling to ask 
officers to help straighten out their wayward children. 
</P>
<P>
"The community has accepted us and is giving us tremendous input on their 
wants, needs and concerns," said Indochinese liaison D. K. Abbott, who directs 
the operation and estimates San Diego's Indochinese refugee population at 
50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pham Sinh is a Vietnamese community service officer who has intimate knowledge 
of the dark side of law enforcement. He was tortured and imprisoned for six 
years by Vietnamese Communists when his government fell in 1975. After standing 
in his own excrement for several months, he finally escaped in a leaky boat 
with his wife, 9-month-old son and 132 other refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the police at home because, when I was young, I fought with them. 
They were corrupt," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
Pematokyryrasmey Chhun, a Cambodian community service officer who also serves 
at the Euclid storefront, said: "When American officers arrive at a crime 
scene, the (Cambodian) victims are so afraid to give information because in 
Cambodia you can be put in jail, asked for bribes. . . . You make a single 
mistake and you can be killed. They are so scared of authority." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting the Word Out 
</P>
<P>
To show that the police really are here to serve and protect, the community 
service officers visit schools, classes in English as a second language, 
business organizations and religious groups to pass out pamphlets and teach 
people when and how to call the police. The East San Diego storefront is even 
equipped with a Laotian typewriter; a Cambodian model is on order. 
</P>
<P>
Ping Yang, a Hmong community service officer who escaped Laos by swimming 
across the Mekong River, said he tells young people experimenting with drugs 
that "you have to sacrifice your life to give money to somebody else . . . and 
that makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
Chhun said he tells fellow Cambodians, "I work for the Police Department, but I 
am the same color as you." He also tries to discourage youngsters from joining 
the AKB (Asian Killer Boys) and the OBW (Oriental Boy Warriors), two Cambodian 
gangs that fight turf wars, burglarize homes and businesses and brandish guns 
-- but stop short of shooting people. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them I was also crazy when I was young. I was on riot -- striking 
against the Cambodian government -- but I never brought the problems home to my 
parents. If you were in Cambodia now, your parents would not have the money to 
support you to go to school. Here, you have opportunity and chance," Chhun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Do they listen? Chhun is confident that they do. "The most important thing is 
the family name," he said. "If you ruin that, you are not really Cambodian 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Program Off Ground 
</P>
<P>
The Indochinese program, although started in 1983, did not really get off the 
ground until the eight officers were hired May 22, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other community service officers, those in the Indochinese program can 
write crime reports and submit them to the district attorney's office. They 
also become involved in "crisis intervention," assisting other police officers, 
sheriff's deputies and FBI agents who do not speak the Indochinese languages 
and sometimes do not understand the Indochinese cultures. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a visiting group of criminal justices and legal experts from 
several other countries earlier this week, Abbott told of a police officer 
puzzled by a Vietnamese suspect who refused to look him in the eye. "He's so 
guilty, he can't look me in the eye," the officer reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not," Abbott said. "That's cultural. He's not supposed to look a 
senior in the eye. It's disrespectful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Domestic Problems 
</P>
<P>
In the Cambodian community, the biggest problem is domestic violence, closely 
followed by runaway juveniles, Chhun said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian husband considers himself king of the household . . . and he 
feels the Cambodian wife has more freedom here than back in Cambodia. Sometimes 
the Cambodian wife says, 'I can go to work, I can visit friends, you can't 
treat me like you do back in Cambodia,' " Chhun said. The husband then beats 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Cambodian wife will almost never press charges against her husband 
for fear of retaliation, Chhun said the counseling the officers give has 
resulted in a decrease in domestic-violence crimes in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 10 times a month I would get a call . . . now it's just one or two a 
month," he said. "Same with juvenile runaways. There have been no reports of 
missing juveniles in the last couple of months. Before, they drove me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
In the Vietnamese community, the most common crimes are car burglaries, auto 
theft and gang violence, according to Tuan Ngoc Nguyen, a community service 
officer who was recently honored by the San Diego Refugee Coalition for 
distinguished community service. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first opened the office," he said, "we found robberies occurred 
because when a (Vietnamese) suspect knocked on the door, the (Vietnamese) 
victim would open the door and say, 'Who are you?' They never considered a 
dead-bolt lock. But it's getting better. Bad guys are still standing on the 
street, but they're scared because now they see that they can be arrested."

COURT RULES AGAINST INCOME-TAX CHECKOFF FOR STATE ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal Tuesday ruled that a conflict between two 
campaign finance reform measures approved last year means that Californians 
won't be allowed to use a voluntary $3 checkoff on state income tax forms to 
help finance state legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
The court's three-judge panel unanimously ruled that the state's Fair Political 
Practices Commission (FPPC), the state's political watchdog agency, was correct 
when it determined that the conflict between provisions in Propositions 68 and 
73 -- both approved by voters last June -- precludes the voluntary income-tax 
checkoff. 
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling was prompted by a legal challenge from the University of San 
Diego's Center for Public Interest Law. 
</P>
<P>
The income-tax checkoff provision was considered to be the centerpiece of 
Proposition 68, which sought to cut down on the clout of special-interest 
groups by creating partial public financing for state legislative races, said 
Julianne B. D'Angelo, the USD center's supervising attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checkoff Canceled 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 73, which establishes contribution limits on candidates for 
both state and local offices, creates an "irreconcilable conflict" by 
specifically outlawing the use of public financing for political campaigns, the 
panel held in its 19-page opinion. 
</P>
<P>
And, since Proposition 73 garnered more votes of the two measures, it takes 
precedent and cancels out the income-tax checkoff provision of Proposition 68, 
the court held. 
</P>
<P>
The court also disagreed with the USD center's contention that the money set 
aside from the voluntary income-tax checkoff did not fall under the definition 
of "public moneys" because it is a tax credit and, as such, rightfully belongs 
to the taxpayer -- not the state. 
</P>
<P>
The judges said that all the $3 checkoff does is allow the taxpayer to make 
sure the amount is transferred from the state's General Fund into a proposed 
Campaign Reform Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Proposition 68 merely allows the taxpayer to redirect $3 of the taxes 
owed from the General fund to a specific fund, the conclusion is inescapable 
that the measure involved public moneys," Tuesday's opinion says. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal also declined to rule on the constitutionality 
of Proposition 73, since that question is pending before the 3rd District Court 
of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
D'Angelo said the USD center will appeal Tuesday's ruling.

That's Hollywood . . . but not really. 
</P>
<P>
Those who regret that they never saw the Pan Pacific Auditorium before it was 
ravaged by fire last week still have an opportunity, of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the new Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park is a replica of the 
Streamline Moderne exterior of the 54-year-old Los Angeles landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is that it's in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Pan Pacific fire, by the way, has convinced Los Angeles City Council 
President John Ferraro that what this city needs is an arson investigator 
blessed with a more sensitive, if wetter, nose. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro noted that Mattie, a black Labrador retriever borrowed from the 
Connecticut State Police, was instrumental in helping investigators determine 
that the blaze was intentionally set because she was able to sniff out the 
starting point of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman proposed that the Los Angeles Fire Department find such a 
creature of its own. But pooches like this aren't just sitting around in dog 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mattie, who can detect the presence of 17 flammable liquids at extremely faint 
levels, is one of just five such specially trained canines in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Hairy situation: The San Fernando Valley has never been fully tamed, but even 
Animal Regulation Department workers were surprised to hear of a sighting by 
one all-news radio station of a "wild yak racing on and off the 118 Freeway 
near the Tampa (Avenue) off-ramp" in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out it was a somewhat less exotic white Charolais bull that had wandered 
off a nearby ranch -- and survived the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Yaks, which are burly, long-haired wild oxen, are usually found in Asian 
precincts such as Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Michael Jackson isn't known to own one. Asked if there were any yaks 
romping on Valley prairies, Thomas Walsh, an Animal Regulation district 
supervisor said: "I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
The first contest involving the private Calabasas Polo Club may be staged in 
Municipal Court rather than on its new field carved out of a canyon at the 
western edge of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they will seek a criminal complaint against the Sherman 
Oaks development company that allegedly built a regulation-size field, barn, 
corrals and a small grandstand without building or grading permits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're home builders," responded Rob Franciscan of Lycon Group. "We were told 
that we didn't need a permit because we weren't building a habitable structure. 
Originally we were told that for temporary equestrian facilities that a permit 
was not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Lycon, which has been summoned to a district attorney's office conference today 
at the Calabasas Municipal Courthouse, is accused, among other things, of 
sumbitting grading plans to the county after 35,000 cubic yards of dirt were 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of a case of putting the bulldozer before the horse.

O'CONNOR TO HIKE REQUEST FOR STATE EMERGENCY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who elicited a skeptical response last week from the 
governor's office when she asked for $34 million in emergency funds to combat 
street crime, said Tuesday that she will submit a new request for a higher 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor made the announcement after meeting with members of a newly created 
Emergency Council, which is supposedly mapping out strategy to deal with a 
"state of emergency" that O'Connor said has been created by a recent spate of 
street gang violence. The mayor said San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen will 
put together a budget proposal with the higher figure that she will submit to 
Gov. George Deukmejian, possibly later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The city is going ahead with the funding proposal despite a virtual guarantee 
from Deukmejian's staff that the governor will veto the request, regardless of 
the amount. O'Connor submitted the request for $34 million in emergency funding 
amid much fanfare last week. Kevin Brett, Deukmejian's press secretary, said a 
state of emergency is traditionally declared only after a natural disaster and 
offered little hope that the governor would accede to O'Connor's request. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going over the concept we will present to the governor," said 
O'Connor. "Thirty-four million dollars does not seem to meet our overall need." 
</P>
<P>
Both O'Connor and Burgreen, who attended the Tuesday meeting, refused to say 
specifically how much money will be needed to meet the supposed crime 
emergency. However, Burgreen offered a "ballpark" figure of between $50 million 
to $100 million to apply a "systemwide approach" to the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Surplus 
</P>
<P>
The mayor declared the state of emergency and submitted the $34-million request 
after state officials announced a $2.5-billion budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said that city officials would also ask the federal government for 
emergency funding but that she was not sure which federal agency would be 
approached. She said her office would contact U.S. drug czar William J. Bennett 
for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen envisions using the state and federal funding at every level of the 
criminal justice system, including hiring more police, building new detention 
facilities and courtrooms and hiring more judges. The chief said the top 
priority in the city's fight against crime is building new detention 
facilities, which are financed by the county and administered by Sheriff John 
Duffy. The county's jails are severly overcrowded, and most misdemeanor 
offenders are either given citations or routinely booked and released.

BAKER'S WARNING TO THE ISRAELIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How can the people of Israel, proud heritors of a tradition of literacy and 
scholarship, tolerate a government which denies education to Palestinians on 
the pretext of "military necessity" (Part I, May 17)? I am so reminded of the 
antebellum Southern policy of forbidding education of slaves that I cannot help 
wondering about the obvious parallelism between these two situations.

BAKER'S WARNING TO THE ISRAELIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Again, Israel comes to us and asks for $3 billion in yearly aid (Part I, May 
13). Under the provisions of the so-called "Humphrey-Kennedy" amendment, the 
U.S. government can suspend all military aid to a country guilty of human 
rights violations. We have clear evidence of violations of human rights in the 
occupied territories by the Israeli government. I believe that suspension of 
military aid to Israel would result in a dramatic change in an otherwise 
intransigent attitude of the Israeli government towards negotiations for a 
peaceful settlement in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
I am absolutely opposed to my tax dollars going for the support of a government 
which flagrantly and willfully violates human rights. 
</P>
<P>
It is now time for people of good conscience to make a clear statement to 
Israeli government officials that they must try with every resource to work 
towards a peaceful settlement of the dispute with the Palestinians on the West 
Bank.

BAKER'S WARNING TO THE ISRAELIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James Baker delivered a strong warning to the pro-Israel 
lobbying organization, saying that Israel must be realistic and give up 
territorial claims (Part I, May 23). 
</P>
<P>
I will ask a very simple question of Baker. When has our country ever given up 
territories won in a war? 
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, the Israelis didn't start the wars they won; they fought 
hard to survive only after being attacked and because of superiority in 
strength -- not in numbers of personnel -- they won. 
</P>
<P>
I don't see the U.S. giving up New Mexico or any other part of our county -- 
and I have never noted our country returning land to the Indians that we took 
with or without fighting for it. 
</P>
<P>
Let's be realistic. If the Israelis were to give up the territories they would 
be committing suicide, pure and simple. They would have their enemy within just 
a few short miles -- ready and anxious to thoroughly defeat Israel. And the 
U.S. would have to help in the rescue, bringing in our troops; this is 
something Israel doesn't want the U.S. to do and our own Americans would refuse 
to participate on principle. 
</P>
<P>
The sooner the Arabs -- with their enormous wealth and so much open land -- 
take care of their own, the Palestinians, the sooner peace can prevail. And 
none of this has a thing to do with giving up territories legally and ethically 
won by the Israelis.

STATE SURPLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When loose money is on the table, a scramble for it is to be expected. 
Returning it to the people, spreading it out for teachers' pay, repairing 
roads, etc. are worthy options. 
</P>
<P>
Why not apply a reasonable portion of the state's $2.5 billion surplus to 
shelter, food and medical help for the homeless, plus part to job training and 
placement programs for the unemployed that would match business needs? 
</P>
<P>
Since their burdens are human and immediate, I would think they merit priority 
consideration. Just think of the benefits.

DENG DIDN'T LEARN LESSON; 
</P>
<P>
TAKES WRONG TACK IN ATTACKING MESSENGERS, NOT THE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BAUM, Richard Baum is a professor of political science at UCLA, 
where he specialized in contemporary Chinese politics and foreign policy. He 
was in China during the student demonstrations in late May. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is tragic irony in Deng Xiaoping's current hard-line resistance to 
widespread public demands for political reform in China. A little more than a 
decade ago, Deng rode to power on the crest of a similar wave of popular 
discontent. Sadly, China's paramount leader seems to have all but forgotten the 
primary lesson of his own ascendancy: Killing the messenger is no antidote for 
bad news. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1976, there was a similar show of civil defiance in Tian An Men 
Square following the death of another popular Chinese leader, Deng's longtime 
friend and mentor, Premier Zhou En-Lai. That set in motion a chain of events 
that brought Deng to power as hero of a citizens' revolt against governmental 
disdain for the common man. 
</P>
<P>
Following Zhou's death, a small clique of radical ideologues, the so-called 
Gang of Four, banned all public mourning ceremonies for fear that popular 
displays of grief for the deceased premier might undercut their own political 
authority. Denied legitimate channels of expression, a wave of repressed 
popular sentiment -- a mixture of sorrow and resentment, additionally fueled by 
a decade of radical-induced Cultural Revolution turmoil -- welled up within the 
Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
The wave crested a few months later, on the occasion of a traditional Chinese 
festival honoring the memory of departed ancestors. On April 4, 1976, tens of 
thousands of people spontaneously congregated at Tian An Men Square, where they 
placed commemorative wreaths, poems, and essays honoring Zhou at the foot of a 
monument to the heroes of the Chinese revolution. Some of the poems and essays 
referred pointedly, and poignantly, to the feelings of powerlessness and rage 
experienced by ordinary Chinese citizens who had been peremptorily precluded 
from openly displaying their grief. Other posters referred obliquely to the 
destruction wrought by the radical leaders of China's chaotic Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing a new wave of popular unrest, the Gang of Four moved quickly to control 
the situation at the square. They ordered the offending wreaths and writings 
removed under cover of darkness. The next day, as more than 100,000 angry 
citizens converged on the square demanding to know who had been responsible for 
the removal, the Gang called in the army and security police to restore order. 
Hundreds of protesters were arrested in the ensuing confrontation; dozens were 
beaten, some of whom subsequently died of their injuries. The demonstration 
itself was officially labeled by the Politburo as "counterrevolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for a scapegoat upon whom to pin responsibility for the incident, the 
Gang of Four claimed that the masses had been "hoodwinked" and "incited" by a 
notorious anti-party, anti-socialist troublemaker. The troublemaker's name? 
Deng Xiaoping, erstwhile protege of Zhou. Having been effectively discredited, 
Deng was peremptorily stripped of all official posts and titles. For months 
thereafter he was relentlessly vilified in the radical-controlled Chinese mass 
media as an "unrepentant capitalist roader." 
</P>
<P>
Deng's descent into political purgatory was short-lived. Responding to a 
mounting popular "crisis of confidence" that swept through China following the 
September, 1976, death of Mao Tse-tung and the arrest a month later of the Gang 
of Four (on charges of conspiring to usurp party leadership), the Politburo 
quietly rehabilitated Deng in 1977. A year later, party leaders reversed their 
original verdict on the Tian An Men incident, exonerating Deng and 
retroactively declaring the incident to be "fully revolutionary." Thus 
vindicated, Deng quickly consolidated his gains, riding to power on a wave of 
popular revulsion over governmental high-handedness and disdain for the vox 
populi. 
</P>
<P>
There is something eerily, uncannily familiar about the drama currently being 
enacted in Tian An Men Square. Once again, as in 1976, a massive, spontaneous 
outpouring of repressed sentiment has occurred at the very heart of the Chinese 
capital, fueled this time by a decade of uneven economic reform that, for all 
its genuine accomplishments, has dramatically increased income inequality in 
China spawned high rates of urban inflation, and multiplied the opportunities 
for ill-gotten gain via corruption and nepotism. Once again, the powers that be 
have sought to slander what is clearly an authentic mass protest movement as 
the work of a small handful of "counterrevolutionary" conspirators. Once again 
the army has been called in to restore order, by force if necessary; once again 
a political purge is in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
What is so tragically ironic about all this is that now it is Deng Xiaoping 
himself who is playing the role of autocratic antihero previously performed by 
the Gang of Four. With dour, colorless Premier Li Peng as his stalking horse, 
Deng has instinctively opted to clamp down on the perceived sources of dissent 
and disorder -- China's liberal intelligentsia. Like countless Chinese emperors 
before him, Deng has opted for order over equity, obedience over authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, the party and army undoubtedly have the capacity to impose a 
crackdown on a few hundred or even a few thousand dissident intellectuals. In 
the long run, however, a strategy of "killing the messenger" can only prove 
counterproductive, a lesson Deng seems to have learned but then forgotten.

TEACHER STRIKE: THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA Q. MORGAN and RALPH C. DILLS, State Sen. Rebecca Q. Morgan (R-Los 
Altos Hills) is vice chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee. State Sen. 
Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) chairs the Governmental Operations Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the relationship between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its 
teachers collapsed and the teachers went out on strike, we all witnessed 
educational paralysis. Thousands of children suffered an unconscionable loss 
mainly because their school district and their teachers could not get along. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has clearly had the most visible labor-management troubles of any 
district in California, but it is unfortunately not unique. The Los Angeles 
impasse is but one manifestation of the adversarial relations that currently 
exist between teachers and district management in many parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
In light of these problems, one may appropriately ask: Is it inevitable for 
school districts and teachers to engage in conflict? Or can both sides in fact 
better serve their own interests by pursuing a more cooperative style of 
negotiation? 
</P>
<P>
In the private sector, American companies and unions have been forced by 
competitive pressures to learn cooperative and participatory styles of labor 
relations. Can cooperation work in the schools as well? We believe there is no 
place where it can -- and must -- work better. 
</P>
<P>
California's teachers and district management share a joint responsibility for 
educating young people. In virtually all things relating to education, they are 
expected to cooperate. For example, they work together to develop curricula, to 
devise new programs and to set educational goals for students. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to contract negotiations, too often their natural cooperation 
breaks down and both sides lace up their gloves in anticipation of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Some blame this anomaly on the application of collective bargaining laws to 
school districts. We disagree. The collective bargaining structure has proven 
itself sound and useful. The structure is not intended to be, and need not be, 
a vehicle for conflict. Just because collective bargaining has sometimes been 
practiced in confrontational ways does not mean that confrontation is the only 
way -- or even the best way -- to operate under the system. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, negotiation specialists like those at the Harvard University 
Negotiation Project have found that both sides in a collective bargaining arena 
stand to gain if they refuse to look at the negotiation as a win/lose 
proposition and instead treat it as a creative exercise in joint problem 
solving. Under this approach, the negotiators get together to identify 
problems, pursue joint interests and establish common goals. In this way, to 
the greatest extent possible, neither side gives in but rather both sides win. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to change from a counterproductive conflict style of collective 
bargaining to one that stresses the importance of building trust and 
cooperative, long-term relationships. To do this, both teachers and management 
need to engage in some new thinking about negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Several school districts throughout the state, in places like San Marcos (North 
San Diego County), Folsom-Cordova, Napa and Ukiah have on their own 
successfully made this change toward collaborative-style collective bargaining. 
Others have engaged in experimental projects called "trust agreements" where 
teachers and their districts agree to pursue a cooperative solution to 
particular problems such as curriculum, staff development or peer review. 
</P>
<P>
However, due to a lack of awareness and familiarity with the process, these 
encouraging advances have not yet caught on in many parts of California. The 
state needs to play a role in fostering cooperative bargaining relationships in 
districts that yearn to pursue alternatives to conflict, but don't yet have the 
skills to start. 
</P>
<P>
We support the establishment of a voluntary statewide program for training 
employee and district negotiators. The program would focus on how to reduce 
conflict by approaching the collective bargaining relationship in constructive 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
Administered by the Public Employment Relations Board, the program would 
provide intensive workshops and seminars in which union and management would 
jointly participate in forming practical, cooperative partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
An investment of this kind promises to reduce conflict over the long run. And 
it just might prevent impasses like the one that plagued the Los Angeles 
district and its students.

MILITARY AID WOULD HELP AVOID A RETURN TO THE KILLING FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN J. SOLARZ, Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) is chairman of the Asian and 
Pacific Affairs subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Vietnam prepares to withdraw its forces from Cambodia, Pol Pot and the Khmer 
Rouge, who cold-bloodedly killed up to 2 million of their fellow Cambodians the 
last time they held power, appear to be positioning themselves to once again 
seize control. 
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid such a dreadful denouement to the Cambodian drama, we need a 
comprehensive strategy designed to promote a political settlement that will end 
the fighting and effectively prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to facilitate the negotiation of such a settlement, there are a 
number of steps the United States should take. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We should use our influence in Beijing to persuade the Chinese to terminate 
their support for the Khmer Rouge, regardless of whether the Cambodians reach a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We should press Thailand to deny the use of its territory for Khmer Rouge 
base camps. Stripped of their sanctuaries, the Khmer Rouge would find it much 
more difficult to mount a serious threat against whatever government emerges 
from the current negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States should appoint a special emissary for Cambodia, as it has 
for Afghanistan, Central America and the Middle East. Such a step would 
maximize our capacity to shape a political settlement compatible with the best 
interests of the Cambodian people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In order to encourage the negotiation of a political settlement, we should 
strengthen the hand of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, the leaders of the 
two non-communist resistance groups, by providing military assistance to the 
movements they lead. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to Southeast Asia, it became apparent to me that Cambodian 
Premier Hun Sen holds the key to a satisfactory resolution of the conflict. 
Unlike Afghanistan, where the moujahedeen are insisting on the departure of 
President Najibullah and the members of the Afghan Communist Party as a 
condition for concluding a settlement, the non-communist resistance in Cambodia 
is willing to share power in an interim government with Hun Sen and his current 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no agreement will be possible as long as Hun Sen insists that any 
settlement must be based on an acceptance of the existing government, thereby 
excluding Sihanouk and Son Sann from any meaningful role in a transitional 
arrangement, And as long as he believes that the United States may be prepared 
to accept his regime as the legitimate voice of the Cambodian people, he is 
unlikely to make the concessions necessary for a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects for a political settlement would be significantly enhanced by 
sending a strong signal to Hun Sen and his Vietnamese patrons that the United 
States will not accept the existing regime as a fait accompli. By showing our 
support for Sihanouk and Son Sann through the provision of military assistance, 
we would create more incentives for Hun Sen to make the concessions necessary 
for a genuine settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Those who suggest that providing arms to the non-communist resistance would 
obstruct a political settlement miss the point of the proposal. The purpose is 
not to increase the level of violence in Cambodia, but to enhance the prospects 
for a political settlement that will bring the violence to an end. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, of course, that the negotiations will break down and that no 
political settlement will be reached. In that case, military assistance to the 
non-communists also would constitute a further hedge against the return to 
power of the Khmer Rouge, who still field a fierce and formidable force of 
30,000 to 40,000 men under arms. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics have said that any aid we provide the non-communist resistance will 
inevitably end up in the hands of the Khmer Rouge. But the resistance forces do 
not train or fight with the Khmer Rouge and are not even located in close 
proximity to them. Indeed, over the last decade there is no known instance of 
such arms shipments being diverted to the Khmer Rouge. This is an "imaginary 
horrible" that need not concern us. 
</P>
<P>
Others fear that the provision of lethal aid to the resistance will gradually 
lead to a more direct involvement by the United States. These concerns are 
grossly exaggerated. After years of aiding the moujahedeen in Afghanistan 
without the introduction of U.S. troops or advisers, there is no reason to 
believe that a decision to send military assistance to the non-communist 
resistance will lead us down the slippery path toward another American military 
involvement in Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration of Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia would be both politically 
unacceptable and morally unthinkable. The whole purpose of providing arms to 
the non-communists is to prevent, at the negotiating table if possible but on 
the battlefield if necessary, the Khmer Rouge from once again turning Cambodia 
into the killing fields.

CHILD-ABUSE UNIT ACTIVE, DUFFY TELLS GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy, responding to a San Diego County Grand Jury report critical 
of the disbanding of the sheriff's child-abuse unit, denied Tuesday that the 
unit was ever shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's denial came as a surprise to Susan Golding, chairwoman of the county 
board of supervisors. "If that's the case, it's certainly something he could 
have said a long time ago," she said, adding that the board was told that the 
specialized unit had ceased to exist. In a written response released Tuesday, 
Duffy criticized a grand jury recommendation that the county allocate money 
specifically for the child-abuse unit, saying it would "hamstring" his 
effectiveness as sheriff. However, Golding said the board of supervisors is 
likely to honor the grand jury's request in its upcoming budget deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, in a report released April 20 that addressed the dismal state 
of the county's system for dealing with abused children, recommended that the 
Sheriff's Department immediately re-establish the child-abuse unit Duffy said 
he would disband after a series of volatile disputes last summer with the board 
of supervisors over the sheriff's budget. 
</P>
<P>
During the board's budget deliberations then, Duffy complained of not receiving 
enough money to keep his department afloat, and threatened to shut down the 
child-abuse unit and other specialized units as a result. 
</P>
<P>
County agencies have 60 days in which to respond to grand jury reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Thought It Was Dead 
</P>
<P>
Both the board of supervisors and the grand jury believed the child abuse unit 
had been subsequently disbanded. "The information we had received was that it 
had been disbanded as a unit, even though there were still officers responding 
to child-abuse calls," Golding said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But in his written response to the grand jury report, Duffy said that "contrary 
to popular belief," the child-abuse unit had never been disbanded, only 
"decentralized." Six deputies who had been assigned to the unit were 
transferred to outlying substations, where they continued to work on 
child-abuse cases, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
The shuffling of personnel was part of the sheriff's "emergency redeployment 
plan," which took effect Nov. 1, because money for basic services had not been 
provided by the county, Duffy said. "The potential for adversely affecting 
officer and citizen safety was becoming increasingly severe. I therefore found 
it necessary to formulate plans to staff these basic functions on a temporary 
basis with personnel from other areas of the department," the sheriff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed county budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 includes an 
$18.8-million increase in the sheriff's budget, which Duffy said will fund 
"most of the critical vacancies." All of the "redeployed" personnel are 
scheduled to return to their original duties July 1, and the child-abuse unit 
will resume business as usual at its centralized station, according to Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury report also suggested that the county specifically allocate 
money for the child-abuse unit -- money which could not be diverted to any 
other use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fought Recommendation 
</P>
<P>
Duffy fought the recommendation by citing the County Charter, which gives him 
authority to organize the sheriff's department. "I must be allowed the 
administrative flexibility to address internal resource allocation needs," 
Duffy wrote, adding that to do otherwise might threaten the public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Though the county has traditionally permitted the sheriff to decide how to use 
the money allocated for his department, Golding said it is legally possible for 
the board to designate the use of certain funds. "I can't speak for the rest of 
the board members," Golding said Tuesday, "but at the moment I would say the 
likelihood is that we would" allocate money specifically for a child-abuse 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
The board of supervisors will begin deliberations on the county budget June 26.

JUDGE TO HEAR EASTWOOD DISPUTE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke will go before a judge today in a 
closed hearing to discuss the potentially precedent-setting palimony suit Locke 
filed against the actor last month. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before filing suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on April 26 for 
financial support, breach of contract, emotional distress and possession of 
personal property, Locke -- who has been Eastwood's companion of 13 years but 
is legally married to another man -- attempted to settle the matter by asking 
for what her lawyers termed "a rather modest request." 
</P>
<P>
Locke's settlement offer included a Bel-Air home that the couple had shared, 
another house in the Hollywood Hills that Eastwood allegedly bought for Locke 
and her husband, monthly payments of up to $15,000 and a lump sum of $250,000, 
according to legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
Although Eastwood rejected the offer, its particulars will likely be discussed 
in today's private hearing. Locke and Eastwood have hired a Superior Court 
judge, who will preside over the case. (The practice of hiring private judges, 
a relatively new twist in civil litigation, is becoming increasingly popular in 
high-profile divorce and contract disputes such as the Locke-Eastwood case.) 
</P>
<P>
Neither side has disclosed the name of the judge or the location of the hearing 
and, the proceedings have been closed to all but the participants. All legal 
documents in the case have been ordered sealed. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration filed last month, Locke said she was notified on April 10 
while on the set of "Impulse," a film she was directing, that the locks of 
their 5,000 square-foot Bel-Air house had been changed and all her belongings 
placed in storage. 
</P>
<P>
A four-page letter written by Locke's attorneys -- and obtained this week by 
The Times -- spelled out the specifics of the settlement offer and called 
Locke's eviction "a blitzkrieg assault." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two houses -- the tile-roofed Bel-Air house sold for 
$1,125,000 in 1980 and the price of the Hollywood Hills house was $300,000 in 
1982 -- and the one-time payment of $250,000, the settlement offer asked for 
support payments of $15,000 per month for four years, tapering to $12,500 per 
month the fifth year, followed by $10,000 per month the sixth year, and $7,500 
per month the seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
Area real-estate agents say the Bel-Air property is now worth more than $4 
million, and the Hollywood Hills house about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy and tempting to inflate Sondra's settlement request 
for negotiating purposes (particularly in light of Clint's wealth) or to be 
simply opportunistic; but it is not my style and not Sondra's," Locke's 
attorney Norman S. Oberstein wrote in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is neither to gather the last dollar nor to obtain a settlement 
in light of Clint's substantial exposure and ability to pay; rather, it is to 
meet Sondra's minimum expectations in light of a 13-year relationship, Clint's 
promises and the emotional and economic time and effort Sondra put into the 
relationship and into the two real properties which she selected and 
developed," the attorney said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood's media representative, Deborah Kelman, released this statement 
Tuesday: "We view it as highly improper for a correspondence between counsel, 
written in anticipation of litigation and containing settlement proposals, 
however inappropriate, to be disclosed to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"This is especially true here, since the court has ordered the entire file to 
be placed under seal. As we said in our previous statement, the suited claims 
were unfounded and the requested settlement was categorically rejected. The 
filing of the lawsuit followed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no settlement discussions pending. We find it surprising that the 
letter would be released on the eve of an important court hearing. Mr. 
Eastwood, for his part, will litigate this case in court and not in the press." 
</P>
<P>
Locke has alleged in her legal papers that Eastwood bought the 5,000 
square-foot Bel-Air home for her and told her to redecorate it as she pleased. 
She has also said that Eastwood bought the English-style Hollywood Hills home 
as a "gift" for her and her husband, West Hollywood sculptor Gordon Anderson, 
with whom, she says, she had an unconsummated marriage and a relationship 
"tantamount to sister and brother," according to legal documents.

'STAND-UP TRAGEDY': FOR THE ACTORS IT'S STAND-UP REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"If people are going to walk out, that's OK," declared Jack Coleman. "People 
(who are offended) should walk out." 
</P>
<P>
The actor was referring to Bill Cain's "Stand-Up Tragedy," a harsh, fast-paced 
drama -- set to a loud rap beat -- about a tough boys' school on New York's 
Lower East Side. After a premiere last March at Taper, Too, "Stand-Up" opens 
Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
It's staged by Ron Link, who has employed the same hard edge and visual/kinetic 
energy he brought to "Shakers" (1988) and "Bouncers" (1986) -- which also 
co-starred Coleman. "The style is not completely dissimilar," the actor said. 
"Ron gives everybody a tremendous amount of freedom to come up with things. 
Then he edits, imposes his vision on it. The play has a real kaleidoscopic feel 
to it. It jumps in and out of time, takes a lot of theatrical license. And 
nobody has a chance to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Or edit their language. "Maybe there should be a warning" -- the former 
"Dynasty" star shrugged -- "because there are plenty of four-letter words. It's 
a play that picks up on the language and rhythms of the street, and it will be 
offensive to some people. But as it goes on, you realize it's not about 
swearing. It's not about being vulgar. It's part of a depiction of inner-city 
life. I hope the force of the characters and story will take over and people 
will be drawn into something that, at first, may be jarring to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't give people time -- at least in the first act -- to worry about the 
kind of language going on because we're throwing so many ideas and pictures at 
them, so many truths and theatrical conventions, that they can't help but sit 
there and take it in," added Vaughn Armstrong, who plays Father Ed Larkin, the 
school's hard-nosed principal. "Hopefully by the time the first act is over, 
they will have reached a deeper understanding than they had before." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, 38, believes the play can have an effect outside the theater too. "I 
don't want to sound like I'm going on some kind of crusade because we're not. 
But as actors, you want to be part of the greater element of life. So if we can 
change one point of view for the better. . . . Like someone saying, 'Somebody 
down there needs some kind of help.' Or giving money to an institution or time 
to a child, or voting in a direction that will make education better. 
Anything." 
</P>
<P>
"What the play does is humanize a group of people who may be threatening to 
some people," added Coleman, who plays a teacher trying to rescue a student 
from the influence of family violence and societal oppression. "Despite the 
harsh language and (crudeness), they're human beings who suffer and have real 
human feelings and want what everyone wants, which is a life. The most cogent 
thing I ever heard about this play came from (playwright/former New York 
teacher) Bill Cain, who said that poverty has nothing to do with money. It has 
to do with having your life taken away from you." 
</P>
<P>
Bronx-born and raised, 26-year-old Michael DeLorenzo (who plays the central 
role of the troubled student Lee) knows firsthand the realities of the play's 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very lucky to have the parents I have," he said. "They're both very 
intelligent, very book-read and cultured. But I went to a lot of public schools 
in New York, so I got to see the other side of it too. I know a lot of people 
like (the ones in) the play. A lot of my best friends are like that. . . ." He 
grinned. "All kidding aside, I think it's because as kids, my parents never let 
me have time on my hands to get into trouble. I was always in outside classes. 
I started dancing when I was 7. I always had places to go, things to do." 
</P>
<P>
The California-born Armstrong (who's married and the father of two boys) also 
credits his mother for setting him on the right track. "We were quite poor," he 
said. "As a girl, my mother picked cotton with her father. She was married to a 
laborer; it was the only life they ever knew. But she kept saying: 'There's 
something better' -- and getting me involved in classes." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who was one of the cast members of the acclaimed 1980 war drama 
"Tracers" (created by a group of Vietnam vets), is clearly enjoying this play's 
integration of politics, art, conscience -- and style. "I've been doing theater 
for 23 years," he noted, "and you don't often get an opportunity to do 
something that has real social benefit. And it's a hell of a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
It's also uncharted territory. "I wanted to do new work," Coleman said bluntly 
of his exit from "Dynasty" 14 months ago. "I feel like I'm just starting out in 
my career. Although I'm 31, I'm a young 31. So I'm just beginning to hit an age 
where most of my work is. I felt that it was important for me to start 
establishing, as soon as possible, my identity (away) from 'Dynasty.' 
</P>
<P>
I made a lot of money in five years, I'm single, I don't have any kids. I mean, 
I could've stayed another year and made a lot more money -- and sometimes," the 
Pennsylvania native grinned, "I think about that. But it was just time to go." 
</P>
<P>
DeLorenzo (who pulled a similar exit from the TV series "Fame" after three 
years) also looks to the stage for artistic nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most demanding role I've ever done in my life," he said. "After 
the workshop, I did a situation comedy -- and I got paid like 10 times the 
amount I got for the workshop. But it meant nothing. I was depressed. Not that 
I don't want to make money, mind you. But having gone from this to the sitcom . 
. . well, it changed me. I'm not doing this play for anybody else. I'm doing it 
for me."

'INDIANA JONES' WRECKS 'PINK CADILLAC' AT THE BOX OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his latest adventure, Indiana Jones travels halfway around the globe to slay 
Nazis, mysterious Middle Eastern cultists and assorted other bad guys who get 
in the way of his search for the Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
But the rogue archeologist has also claimed one victim closer to home: box 
office champ Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which enjoyed the greatest 
dollar volume for an opening week, weekend and single day in movie history -- 
primarily because ticket prices have risen -- trounced Eastwood's latest 
release from Warners, "Pink Cadillac." 
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Day weekend competition between superstar Eastwood and Harrison 
Ford (a.k.a. "Indiana Jones") was the opening blast in what promises to be a 
heated summer war at the box office. Coming soon: "Batman" and "Ghostbusters 
II," both of which -- like "The Last Crusade" -- will play in more than 2,000 
theaters. "Pink Cadillac" played in 1,993 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
With $4.4 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend, opening business 
of Eastwood's movie was half that enjoyed by his previous hits, including "The 
Dead Pool" ($9 million in 1988); "Heartbreak Ridge" ($8.1 million in 1986); and 
"Pale Rider" ($9.1 million in 1985). 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which grossed $37 million over the 
four-day Memorial Day holiday, enjoyed the biggest opening weekend ever, 
according to John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which compiles 
box office figures. The previous record-holder for an opening weekend was 
"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," the second film in the trilogy, with 
nearly $34 million in ticket sales. Despite Paramount's claims of breaking 
records, the film's business was substantially boosted by the increase in 
ticket prices, not because more people bought tickets. Since "Temple of Doom" 
opened in 1984, for example, ticket prices have increased by 22%, according to 
figures provided by Motion Picture Assn. of America. Since 1981, when the first 
installment of the trilogy opened, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," prices have 
increased 48%. 
</P>
<P>
Without adjusting for this inflation, Paramount said that other records broken 
by "The Last Crusade," estimated by studio sources to cost more than $60 
million to produce, were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The biggest opening week. During its first six days in the theater, "The 
Last Crusade" grossed $46.9 million, compared to the previous record-holder, 
"The Temple of Doom," which grossed $45.7 million during its first week in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The biggest single day. Saturday grosses at $11.2 million, as well as 
Sunday grosses at $10.2 million, exceeded those of the previous record-holder 
for a single day, "Beverly Hills Cop II." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Garfinkle, senior vice president of Entertainment Data Inc., predicted 
that "The Last Crusade's" business will drop substantially in the coming week 
because the holiday is over and the "must-sees" -- those who stood in line 
opening weekend -- have already been through the theaters. But he predicted 
that "The Last Crusade" will enjoy good word-of-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones" reunited director Steven Spielberg, executive producer George 
Lucas and star Harrison Ford for the last part of a popular trilogy that began 
in 1981 with the release of "Raiders of the Lost Ark." While audiences and 
critics can endlessly debate the merits of the current film compared to the 
first, "The Last Crusade" is widely considered to be a better crowd-pleaser 
than the second installment, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."

PLAYING THE SHAKUHACHI IN TUNE WITH AN ALIEN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD IWATA, Iwata is a San Francisco free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small audience at UC Berkeley recently found itself enchanted by a rare 
touring ensemble of Tokyo musicians led by Madame Kunie Fujii, the esteemed 
"first lady" of classical Japanese music. 
</P>
<P>
While the stately singer-musician performed ancient court songs and created 
sublime tones on her 13-string koto, curious eyes wandered to the musician at 
her side: a young, brown-haired Caucasian playing the Japanese flute, the 
shakuhachi. 
</P>
<P>
As Madame Fujii finished singing, the sounds from her koto were echoed by the 
flute -- once, twice, thrice in a sharp staccato of call-and-response. Then the 
shakuhachi musician, his body still, tilted his head and drew from the woodwind 
a river of sounds that swept over his rapt listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm a gaijin (foreigner), I guess I stand out in a crowd," said David 
Wheeler, the shakuhachi player, during a reception after the concert. "I 
suppose I'll always have to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler ranks among a handful of Westerners to break into the elite world of 
classical Japanese music. His playing has gained the respect of masters in the 
field, despite the fact that he lives in a culture that rarely embraces 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't easy. In his 12 years of studying the shakuhachi, Wheeler 
confronted the twin barriers of discrimination and of mastering a tradition of 
music alien to Western conventions. 
</P>
<P>
During his study in Japan, the Japanese stared in bemusement at Wheeler and 
mocked him. They told the American he would "never understand the inner depths" 
of classical Japanese music. 
</P>
<P>
The media patronized him and other non-Japanese musicians: Wheeler often 
wondered whether they were interviewing him because he was a good flute player, 
or because he was an oddity, a hakujin (white). 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler was never turned down for a job playing classical Japanese music. But 
other serious American musicians charge that they have been flat-out rejected 
in Japan and by Japanese employers in the United States because of their skin 
color. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I hit a raw nerve in some Japanese people," said Wheeler. "But I don't 
worry about their opinions. The ones who don't know anything about the music 
are usually the ones complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"The musicians I respect never say anything like that," he said. "The true 
experts are not nationalists. They're musicians first, and Japanese second." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the racial tensions, the worst trap for Western musicians seems to be 
the Japanese musical philosophy -- a strict canon handed down with reverence 
from teacher to student, from generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than study much written theory, students try to experience kata, a 
spiritual force that is also found in the martial arts, poetry, literature and 
the theater. At the same time they learn the johakyu aesthetic, a tense yet 
graceful arc of music that rushes to a climax and falls to a calm ending. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, who is bilingual and married to a Japanese woman, symbolizes the 
bridge between Westerners fascinated by the music and conservative Japanese 
musicians leery of foreign influences. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can move one's fingers on the flute," said Wheeler's teacher, Seizan 
Ikeda. "But the importance of adding spiritual feeling and musical meaning is 
something most cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Western music follows melody and smooth harmony, while Japanese 
ensemble music is built on dissonance and rhythmic tension, according to 
Wheeler and others. 
</P>
<P>
"In Western music," said Wheeler, "musicians strive to get all the instruments 
blending in an ideal, purely musical sound. For the Japanese, it's the 
opposite. They appreciate the distinctiveness of the instruments, the different 
flavors." 
</P>
<P>
For Wheeler, the U.S. concerts marked a homecoming in a musical career that 
began when he was an 11-year-old kid "banging away" at the piano "under his 
mother's whip." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager in Seattle, Wheeler played in the Franklin High Jazz Laboratory, 
where he traded riffs with a talented young saxophonist named Kenny G and 
studied musical idols such as Miles Davis and Grover Washington Jr. 
</P>
<P>
During his junior year at Pomona College, the wide-eyed musician flew to Tokyo 
for an exchange program with Waseda University. At an evening concert Wheeler 
found himself seduced by the haunting tones of the shakuhachi. 
</P>
<P>
The American soon won a scholarship to play and study music at the prestigious 
Tokyo University of Fine Art and Music. Wheeler, the son of a labor negotiator 
for the Port of Seattle, had embarked on a journey that would test his Western 
beliefs and musical aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese flute players carry on the ancient tradition of the komuso, the Zen 
priest-warriors of the Fuke sect who played the shakuhachi as they wandered 
across feudal Japan on pilgrimages during the Edo Period (1600-1868). 
</P>
<P>
The priests obeyed rituals and a hierarchy almost as strict as the samurai's 
code of conduct. To discipline themselves, some monks trained outdoors in 
freezing weather. When their bleeding hands grew numb, they soaked them in warm 
water and began again. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Western flute players who seek a refinement of tone, shakuhachi players 
strive for "one-note enlightenment" through suizen, or "blowing Zen." The best 
Japanese flute players hope to reach a sense of timelessness, of arrested 
motion, as in Noh dramas or Buddhist chants. Ideally their music reflects the 
simplicity and rawness of nature.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEVELOPERS DELAY STUDY ON MONORAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top developers in downtown Long Beach have postponed a $60,000 study into 
the feasibility of a "people-mover" or monorail connecting major buildings 
until Walt Disney Co. decides the fate of the Queen Mary site. 
</P>
<P>
Six downtown developers agreed to put off their study at the request of Disney 
executives, who are conducting a long-term examination into whether to build a 
theme park or other attraction in the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The enthusiasm for the study is still there," said Paul W. Stern, executive 
vice president of Ratkovich Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said support for studying a "people-mover" or monorail is still strong among 
the developers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINE OF $35,000 UNFAIR, AVALON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in Avalon are upset over what they call a "grossly unfair" fine of 
$35,000 levied against the city for sewage discharge violations by the Los 
Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, even though the fine is less than 
the board initially recommended. 
</P>
<P>
In a March hearing, the board had recommended a fine of $100,000 but reduced 
that on appeal after considering the city's ability to pay and Avalon 
officials' stated intent to keep the Avalon waste treatment plant in 
compliance, said David Gildersleeve, the board's supervising engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The fine was levied despite explanations by city officials that mechanical 
failures and employee turnover contributed to violations of the city's sewage 
discharge permit at the plant in November and December of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the facts indicated a much lower fine or no fine at all would have 
been reasonable," City Manager Chuck Prince said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHENEY INSPECTS STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney has gotten his first look at the B-2 
stealth bomber on a recent visit to Northrop Corp.'s facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who has delayed full-scale production of the bomber for a year, visited 
the Northrop plants where the B-2 is being built in Palmdale and Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Greg Wasqul said Cheney's visit was part of the defense 
secretary's first trip to California since he was named to the post earlier 
this year. Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood also visited the plants. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2, which is designed to elude enemy radar, costs $500 million per plane, 
making it the most expensive aircraft ever built. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney told a congressional committee last month that the Defense Department 
was having "problems" with the B-2 because of its high costs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he instituted the production delay because of technical problems 
and budgetary constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop began developing the B-2 in 1981. It was originally scheduled to fly 
in 1987 and is now scheduled for its first flight this summer.

MANCINI PASSES SCRUTINY AND FIRST ROUND AT FRENCH OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alberto Mancini bandwagon arrived at the French Open Tuesday and the 
curious at Roland Garros Stadium turned out to see if the hottest player in 
tennis was worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at Court 11 spilled out into the aisles and onto the cement wall at 
one end where they peered around shrubbery, and still others crowded the 
outside balconies at the adjacent Center Court and craned their necks to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini wears his shorts short, wears his hair curly and wears out opponents by 
playing a powerful baseline game on clay. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Argentine is one of the favorites here and he overpowered Simon 
Youl of Australia, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3, to advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini's reaction was one of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said, 'Thank you,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the second round is further than he advanced last year in his 
only other French Open appearance. 
</P>
<P>
But things are going remarkably well for Mancini now. Since the last week of 
April, he has won at Monte Carlo, beating Mats Wilander and Boris Becker, and 
then won again in the Italian Open in Rome, beating Andre Agassi in the final. 
His ranking is a reflection of his recent success, jumping from No. 31 to No. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, new fans appeared, some on the court. Becker said he has never 
seen a player who hits the ball as hard as Mancini on clay. 
</P>
<P>
"Not on both forehand and backhand," Becker said. "(Ivan) Lendl has a really 
strong forehand, but his backhand has topspin. Mancini hits very hard even when 
it's a high shot. You can't come to the net either because he will just hit a 
passing shot. 
</P>
<P>
"If he continues like that, he is going to be very dangerous," Becker said. "He 
has a very good future ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
The present has been pretty good, too. Mancini's popularity has soared. The 
fans and the media flock to him, which he finds both amusing and somewhat 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
"Two months ago, I was just another guy," he said. "It's a big change now. 
Sometimes when the change is so fast, as right now, it's hard to get used to. 
So maybe I am more popular now." 
</P>
<P>
The public is getting used to seeing his handsome face, piercing brown eyes and 
shock of jet-black hair. He is featured in a four-page photo layout in the 
current issue of a French women's fashion magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures tell a story. Mancini smiling in a leather jacket. Mancini smiling 
with his feet up on a wicker love seat. Mancini smiling with his arms resting 
on a chair. 
</P>
<P>
Micky Den Tuinder, his agent, said if Mancini's not a heartthrob, then you 
haven't got a heart. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great-looking guy, he's got a great personality, why shouldn't he be a 
big commercial success?" Den Tuinder said. 
</P>
<P>
Why not indeed? 
</P>
<P>
"To be successful off the court, you have to have a good appearance," Mancini 
said simply. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in sports-crazed Argentina, Mancini has graced the cover of El 
Grafico, the country's biggest sports magazine, and he was featured in Gente, 
the Argentine equivalent of People magazine, all within the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his new-found fame, Mancini has found it necessary to cut his 
commitments. He limited his interviews to two for the tournament, except for 
the general post-match new conferences that all players are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
But the grandson of an Italian and the son of a engineer in Buenos Aires said 
he refuses to be anything else than the same person he was two months ago when 
he was "a nobody." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not important how people look at you, but how you look at yourself," 
Mancini said. "For me, it's a big change now. Everybody knows me. I have to get 
used to it. I like it. If you make an effort to arrive where I am at now, how 
can that be bad?" 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang, the No. 15-seeded player, advanced to the second round with a 
6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-0, 6-3, victory over Eduardo Masso of Argentina,and credited 
two weeks of clay-court work with Jose Higueras in Palm Springs. . . . Andre 
Agassi said he is thinking about playing Wimbledon this year after all, but he 
didn't sound as if he really wanted to. Agassi has planned to take three weeks 
off after the French Open. "Right now, it's not important to me," he said of 
Wimbledon. "Lendl wants to win it, Becker wants to win it, I just want to go 
home." . . . Although no American has won the French Open since Tony Trabert in 
1955, Agassi said he is aware that many believe he has a chance. "I definitely 
feel (pressure) a bit . . . (but) people can only expect me to give 110 
percent," he said. "As long as I'm giving it everything I've got, people can't 
complain or criticize me for losing. If I lose, they're going to have to carry 
me out on a stretcher." . . . Of the 20 Americans in the field, 14 made it into 
the second round. . . . David Wheaton, 19, the only U.S. qualifier, defeated 
the youngest player in the field, 16-year-old Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, 3-6, 
0-6, 6-3, 6-4, 8-6. Wheaton, who played one year at Stanford, had never been in 
a five-set match before. . . . Emilio Sanchez of Spain, who was seeded No. 12, 
withdrew because of a muscle injury and was replaced by Pablo Arraya of Peru, 
but he lost to Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union.

NEWSWIRE: PITINO RELEASED FROM KNICKS' CONTRACT, EXPECTED TO TAKE KENTUCKY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Pitino was released from his contract as coach of the New York Knicks 
Tuesday, freeing him to become basketball coach at the University of Kentucky, 
which is on three-year NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a college basketball coach and I think that's where my heart is," Pitino, 
36, said at a news conference outside Madison Square Garden after a meeting 
with Knicks officials. "And I think that's in the best interest of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Pitino ended his two-year association with the NBA team by reaching agreement 
on terms for the termination of his contract, the Knicks said. Those terms were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino is expected to be selected as head coach at Kentucky this week. He was 
offered the job last week by Wildcats athletic director C.M. Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his negotiations with the Knicks were a bargaining ploy, Pitino said: 
"No, that wasn't the intent of the meeting. The decision was made to go to 
Kentucky yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Pitino reportedly was not getting along with Knick General Manager Al Bianchi, 
the man who hired him away from Providence College. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no dispute and there hasn't been a dispute in two years with Al 
Bianchi," Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi said he was not upset by Pitino's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"No, why should I be mad?" Bianchi said. "Since after his first year here, Rick 
and I have had conversations about professional versus college basketball. I've 
known all along where his heart was." 
</P>
<P>
Pitino led Providence to the 1987 Final Four. He won't be able to take the 
Wildcats there for the next two years because the Wildcats will be barred from 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Among the candidates to succeed Pitino are Dallas Maverick Coach John McLeod, 
North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano, Atlanta Hawk Coach Mike Fratello, Dick 
Motta, the man McLeod replaced in Dallas, and Chicago Bull assistant Phil 
Jackson, a former Knick player.

Dan Reeves, coach of the Denver Broncos, has received a four-year contract 
extension, owner Pat Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but sources said Reeves will be paid 
$785,000 annually, making him one of the National Football League's 
highest-paid coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm one of the top five or six coaches in the league, and I think this 
contract is in line with that," Reeves said at a news conference. "I wasn't 
looking for the biggest salary in the league; I didn't think I deserved that." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, 45, is entering his ninth season as Denver's coach, a tenure during 
which he has compiled a 74-45-1 record, including back-to-back Super Bowl 
appearances after the 1986 and 1987 seasons. The Broncos were 8-8 last season.

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;

<P>
EL SEGUNDO, SAN MARINO REACH 2-A FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the ninth time in 30 years Coach John Stevenson has guided El Segundo High 
School into the Southern Section baseball finals. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (25-5) defeated Temple City (20-8), Tuesday afternoon, 4-2, at 
Culver City High, to advance to the 2-A division final, which is scheduled for 
Saturday at 10 a.m. at Dodger Stadium. El Segundo will play San Marino, a 4-3 
winner over Gladstone. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo has won five Southern Section titles, the last coming in 1979 when 
it defeated Oxnard Hueneme in the 4-A championship. The Eagles' last appearence 
in a final was 1980 when they lost to Santa Ana Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo senior Rick Clark pitched a complete game, giving up six hits and 
junior Garret Quaintance hit a one-out homer in the fifth inning to give the 
Eagles a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino (22-3) won in the bottom of the seventh when Alphonso Montoya lined 
a single to right-center scoring Tony Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia El Dorado 3, Lakewood 2 -- Phil Nevin scored the winning run in the 
bottom of the eighth inning when he crashed into catcher Keith Tripp in the 5-A 
division semifinal game at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp, who was unable to control the ball after taking a throw from Matt Luke, 
laid face down near home plate for several minutes. He lost a front tooth. 
Nevin was thrown out of the game for not sliding but the run counted. The loss 
marked the 14th consecutive year that the top-seeded team in the Southern 
Section major division has failed to win the title. Lakewood, in 1975, was the 
last top-seeded team to win a divisional title. El Dorado (22-8) will play 
Millikan (21-8) in the final, Saturday at 7:30 at Dodger Stadium. Lakewood 
finished the season 27-4. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan 2, Hacienda Heights Wilson 0 -- Millikan's Todd Taylor struck out 12 
and allow only one hit, a clean single with one in the fifth inning by Mark 
Rushlow, as the Rams advanced to the 5-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore 3, Aquinas 2 -- Fillmore (16-6) got the winning run in the bottom of 
the sixth inning when, with two outs, Robbie Ibarra singled, Brad Edmonds and 
Rory Maus walked and Ibarra scored on Jay Weber's error. Fillmore, which 
defeated Crossroad for the 1-A title, will play Beaumont Friday at Blair Field 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rosamond 5, Villanova 1 -- Mark Hartman improved to 12-0 as Rosamond advanced 
to the Southern Section Small Schools final Friday at 4:30 at Blair Field 
against Mammoth, which defeated Cate, 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
Bell 7, South Gate 2 -- Regular shortstop Rene Lopez, who is hitting .509, made 
his fourth start and won his fourth game for the Eagles in the 3-A semifinal. 
Bell (30-5) will play Franklin (17-4), a 8-7 winner over Washington, in the 
City 3-A final, Thursday at Dodger Stadium. Franklin pitcher Phil Arreola 
improved to 11-1-2.

When UCLA won its second consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Assn. track 
and field championship in 1988, it was assumed that the the Bruins would have 
an even better team in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was losing only hurdler Kevin Young from a team that won by 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
But as the NCAA meet starts today at Brigham Young University UCLA's status is 
shaky. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lewis, the Olympic gold medalist in the 400 meters, is doubtful after 
reinjuring a hamstring last week. With Lewis hurt, UCLA Coach Bob Larsen didn't 
even try to qualify his 400 and 1,600-meter relays teams. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of being an overwhelming favorite, UCLA is expected to finish 
behind Florida and Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA still has sprinter Mike Marsh, who also had a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's all said and done, Mike is standing there ready to take his rifle," 
said John Smith, UCLA sprint coach. "He's our steady Freddy." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a senior, is entered in the 100 and 200 meters. His points will be 
vital, as will be those from the UCLA field participants. 
</P>
<P>
However, because of his hamstring injury, Marsh hasn't competed in the 100 
since April 8, when he set a school record of 10.07 seconds in a meet in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I perform my best under pressure and, win, or lose, I like the feeling," Marsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He will be involved in one of the meet's best events, a 100 that will feature 
Texas Christian's Raymond Stewart, who recently had a time of 9.97 seconds; 
Florida's Dennis Mitchell, who beat Marsh by 0.01 seconds last April, and 
Houston's Leroy Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh is the only Bruin sprint star remaining from the championship teams of 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot 11-inch, 165-pounder was a state champion in the 200 at Hawthorne 
High School, but still came to UCLA as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
"I had scholarship offers from Nebraska and Arizona State, but it was more 
important to go where I wanted to go and be happy," Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh has been on scholarship since his freshman year in 1986, when he won the 
100 in the Pacific 10 meet. He won the 100 again last year and was sixth in the 
Olympic trials, earning a place as an alternate on the sprint relay team at 
Seoul. He didn't have a chance to compete, however, as the U.S. team was 
disqualified for passing out of its zone in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
He was regarded as a 200-400 runner in high school, but Smith converted him to 
a short-distance sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike had the quick feet and cadence to be a short sprinter," Smith said. "He 
reminded me of James Sanford (former USC sprinter), who ran the 400 in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very intense and intelligent and has the ability to correct things under 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh originally balked at becoming a 100-200 athlete, but now he has settled 
into his role. 
</P>
<P>
"In the shorter sprint distances, more things come into play," he said. "One or 
two mistakes and it's over. In the 200 and 400, you have more space." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will have eight athletes available for the NCAA meet if Lewis can't 
compete, many in multiple events. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, USC has five competitors in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to finish in the top 10 and, with a run of good fortune, we can do 
better than that," USC Coach Ernie Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Quincy Watts, the former Taft High School star who was expected to 
anchor USC's 400-meter relay team, is unable to compete because of a lingering 
hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's women's team will probably finish well, but Louisiana State, with 
sprinter Dawn Sowell and hurdler Tananjalyn Stanley, is a strong favorite. 
</P>
<P>
USC's women will be represented by seven athletes, most notably middle-distance 
runner Lesley Noll, intermediate hurdler Leslie Maxie and sprinter-half miler 
Michelle Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
The first two days of the NCAA meet will consist primarily of trials and 
qualifying in track and field events. The heptathlon starts today and the 
women's 10,000 meters is scheduled tonight. UCLA's Tonya Sedwick, a 
multi-talented athlete and Pac-10 heptathlon winner, will not compete in the 
long jump and 200 because of a schedule conflict with the heptathlon. . . . 
Eleven athletes will represent the women's team. . . . UCLA men's Coach Bob 
Larsen on the status of injured Steve Lewis: "It's doubtful whether he'll 
compete. We don't want to take a chance of putting an Olympic champion in 
jeopardy for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen said that senior Christian Cushing-Murray barely failed to get an NCAA 
qualifying time in the 1,500 Sunday at Mt. San Antonio College. Cushing-Murray 
was timed in 3:42.95; the qualifying standard was 3:42.70. . . . UCLA's Jim 
Ortiz failed to qualify for the 3,000-meter steeplechase, missing the event 
when he was involved in a minor automobile accident.

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: BRYANT HAS A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH 400

When Beno Bryant of Dorsey High School runs the 400 meters, he looks at ease 
with himself, unlike his preparation that is anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I really dislike the quarter (-mile), especially when it comes time to run," 
said Bryant, who set a new City record of 46.63 last Thursday night at the City 
Track and Field Championships at Birmingham High School. "The only time I like 
it, is after I am done." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who only started to run the 400 meters late last season, has found 
success in this one lap race despite his pre-race jitters. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he is undefeated against California competition at 400 meters, 
suffering his only loss to Albert Ransom of Denver Montbello at the Arcadia 
Invitational April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant seems to reach a new level with every race, witnessed by his 46.1 anchor 
leg in Dorsey's 1,600-meter relay 3:13.38 victory Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I just run to the level of my competition," said Bryant, who is headed to the 
University of Washington on a football scholarship. "I have been gaining 
experience with every race." 
</P>
<P>
With his success, Bryant's reputation has grown and so has the pressure for him 
to win every race. 
</P>
<P>
He was in attendance last Friday night at the Southern Section Masters meet at 
Cerritos College, and says that he received a great deal of attention after 
Curtis Conway of Hawthorne ran a 45.8 anchor leg in the Cougars' 1,600 meter 
relay 3:13.43 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe all of the people staring at me after he ran," Bryant said. 
"It was if I was Sugar Ray Leonard watching a fight or something. 
</P>
<P>
"When the loudspeaker mentioned our (1,600 meter relay time) after Hawthorne's 
race, people where calling my name and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who also finished second in the City 100 final and anchored the Dons' 
winning 400-meter relay team, is aware of a possible showdown with Conway, his 
former Jr. All-American football teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been thinking about it ever since Friday night," he said. "There is not 
any rivalry between us, but people are trying to make one." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who has been working after school for the for the Centinela Collection 
Agency, respects USC-bound Conway. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a good race because he is a good runner," Bryant said. "But I am 
in it to win it just like he is." 
</P>
<P>
Winning the girls' City 400 meters was an another Dorsey runner, senior Angela 
Rolfe, who also won the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Rolfe, two-time defending 400-meter state champion, has emerged this season as 
one of the most consistent runners in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In considering her sprint sweep, Rolfe said she was surprised with her 
100-meter victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The one event that I did not expect to win was the 100 meters," Rolfe said. "I 
knew that it would match (Locke's) Leann Tinkshell's start against my finish. 
</P>
<P>
In the City girls' 800 meters, Kim McAllister of Locke and Camille Mayo of Los 
Angeles were involved in a bizarre fall, costing both a shot at a state title. 
</P>
<P>
In a showdown between the two top 800-meter runners in the city, both started 
with a fast first lap. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Houston-bound McAllister broke for the lead at 200 meters, 
with Mayo close behind. At the 350 mark, Mayo made an inside move past 
McAllister. 
</P>
<P>
A stride later, Mayo went down, with McAllister tumbling down over her. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know what happened," said Mayo, who will attend Southern University 
in New Orleans in the fall. "I just know I had taken the lead and she was 
trying to pass me again; then the next thing I knew I was on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Said McAllister: "I knew both of us would start out fast. I had felt her coming 
past me on my inside, then she tripped. I could not do anything but fall over 
her after that." 
</P>
<P>
Trisha Phillips of Locke, who went on to win the race, said she was surprised 
with the pace of their start. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to move up on them right before they fell," said Phillips, a 
junior . "I am glad I did not go out with them, because I would have went down 
too." 
</P>
<P>
However, for McAllister and Mayo, there is a happy ending, as both qualified in 
the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>

FIERCE SHOOT-OUT WOUNDS SEVEN IN BUNGLED HOLDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SUSPECT SHOT BY ARMORED CAR GUARD AT BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS and CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven people, including five bank customers, were injured Tuesday during a 
fierce shoot-out between an armored car courier and a teen-age robbery suspect 
inside a Wells Fargo Bank in the Crenshaw shopping district of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old suspect was critically wounded during the exchange of gunfire. 
The courier escaped serious injury when a gunshot hit a bulletproof vest he was 
wearing under his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"It saved my life," said courier Miguel Sumano, 30, who suffered a bullet wound 
in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rash of Holdups 
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out was the latest in a yearlong rash of armored car holdups in 
Southern California that have claimed the lives of three couriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles really is a hotbed of armored car robberies," said James L. 
Dunbar, chief executive officer of Baltimore-based Federal Armored Express 
Inc., target of the latest robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery attempt began at 9:43 a.m. Tuesday at the Leimert Park branch of 
Wells Fargo Bank, located at 43rd Place and Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
As horrified customers looked on, the unidentified teen-ager got up from a 
chair inside the bank lobby and fired five shots from a .38-caliber revolver at 
Sumano, who had just walked in the door carrying bags filled with deposits from 
local merchants. Police speculated that the youth knew when the courier would 
be arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Sumano whirled and drew his 9-millimeter handgun, shooting the suspect three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Following company procedures, a second guard remained inside the armored truck. 
</P>
<P>
The youth ran outside and collapsed on the sidewalk as startled customers 
standing at a nearby automated teller machine turned and ran. 
</P>
<P>
"He came through the door and that's when the guard shot him again," said 
Michael Jones, 25, who witnessed the shooting. "He grabbed his back and fell 
down. Then the guard put the gun to his head and said, 'Don't move!' " 
</P>
<P>
A man who apparently was an accomplice of the would-be robber was standing 
about five feet from Jones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Down an Alley 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was standing up there waiting for the (automatic) Ready Teller," 
Jones said. But when the shooting started, both he and the apparent accomplice 
ran down an alley beside the bank. 
</P>
<P>
The accomplice jumped into a late-model, silver-blue Chevrolet Camaro or 
Pontiac Firebird, in which a third man was waiting behind the steering wheel. 
The accomplice yelled "Go!" at the driver, and the pair sped off. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses claimed that the courier continued shooting the suspect even 
while he was down, but Jones said the courier did not shoot him after he fell 
to the ground. He said the suspect's gun flew out of his hand when he hit the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Elijah, one of a crew of Department of Water and Power workers trying to 
repair a damaged water main on Crenshaw Boulevard, also heard the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a pop, pop, pop and it sounded like gunshots," Elijah said. "Then I 
heard a crash. I don't know if he (the suspect) came through the door, or 
(just) fell. I just saw a man go down hollering." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undergoes Surgery 
</P>
<P>
The wounded youth was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he underwent 
surgery for bullet wounds in the head and right side of his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just in very, very bad shape," said hospital spokesman Ron Wise, who 
described the injuries as "devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the injuries suffered by bank customers were "relatively minor." 
</P>
<P>
"It's believed that bullets from the gun, or bullet fragments or broken glass, 
injured five other persons, but none seriously," said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Bob Ruchhoft. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified two of the injured customers as Evelyn Washington, 30, 
who was wounded in the forearm, and Torrance Reese, 28, who had a bruise on his 
foot and cuts from shattered glass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Women Treated 
</P>
<P>
Three other women were treated and released from Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood. One was injured by glass fragments and the others 
suffered superficial gunshot wounds. They were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, armored car executives are wondering why Los Angeles seems to have 
so many holdups. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place that we've got them is in the Los Angeles area," said Dunbar, 
who also serves as chairman of the Armored Transportation Institute, an 
industry training organization. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar said that he was in Los Angeles to speak to police officials less than a 
month ago in an effort to help combat the rash of robberies. Dunbar said that 
proper training and regular refinement of the system are the primary methods to 
combat robberies. 
</P>
<P>
There is no other means of moving big shipments of cash, he said, and there are 
limitations to the amount of personnel and gunfire that can be thrown at 
robbers. While some drivers have suggested going to three-man crews, Dunbar 
said that it is unlikely to help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Record 
</P>
<P>
"The armored car industry as we know it today is only 65 years old," he said. 
"And if you go over the course of the entire 65 years, the major holdups that 
have occurred have occurred with three-man crews. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more two-man crews than three-man crews but they haven't had as may 
holdups," he said. "If we put three-man crews out, they come at us with 
four-man gangs. They can always top us by whatever it is because we're the ones 
they are pointing the fingers at. Why not have four people or why not have 
five?" 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bray, an armored car security consultant, said that some Los Angeles 
armored car business managers have been looking into various ways of refining 
their operations because of the crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
Training and awareness are two keys to thwarting robberies, he said. And there 
have been recent efforts to modify armored trucks by changing the configuration 
of doors and allowing the driver more visibility, according to Bray, who is 
former secretary-treasurer of the Independent Armored Car Operators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he said, " . . . there are only a few different ways you can get money 
out of a mall and put it into a bank." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Time for Guard 
</P>
<P>
Sumano, the courier, said that this was the second time in two years that 
someone has attempted to rob him on the job. He said that sometime last year he 
was carrying some money when a man walked up behind him, apparently intending 
to rob him. 
</P>
<P>
"I said what the hell did he want and he backed off," Sumano said. "(He) ran 
away. (He) didn't want a shoot-out." 
</P>
<P>
Sumano, who said he has been a courier for only two years, would not comment on 
the Tuesday incident because of company policy. 
</P>
<P>
He said that despite Tuesday's close call, he does not plan to quit the job. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing else I can do."

MRS. BUCKEY TESTIFIES SHE WAS MOLESTED AS A CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the two defendants in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case testified 
Tuesday that she herself was a victim of child molestation, but said her 
parents never told authorities about it. 
</P>
<P>
"(They) felt it was not the thing to do," Peggy McMartin Buckey testified under 
cross-examination, adding that she concurred in that decision: ". . . I'm a 
person who believes in going to the (accused) person." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 62, who with her son, Raymond Buckey, faces 65 counts of molestation 
and conspiracy involving 11 youngsters, was not asked to elaborate about her 
claim of being molested. It came as prosecutors were asking Buckey if she -- as 
parents have maintained -- cited her own experience when questioned about 
alleged improprieties at the school. 
</P>
<P>
While confirming she had told parents she herself was a victim, Buckey denied 
she had argued with them that it was not a "big deal" to be molested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Day of Cross-Examination 
</P>
<P>
The admission that a defendant in the widely publicized molestation case, the 
longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history, was molested as a child 
capped the prosecution's second day of cross-examination, which resumed after a 
recess of several days due to the death of a juror's father. 
</P>
<P>
In response to prosecution questions, Buckey described her son, Raymond, now 
31, as a misfit and shy young man who was uncomfortable both with his peers and 
adults, preferred children, and had serious problems with drinking and 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Even as a small child, she said, her son "did not always feel accepted by his 
peers." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey sat at the defense table during his mother's testimony and appeared 
unsettled during parts of it. He is expected to be the final defense witness. 
Both mother and son have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy McMartin Buckey testified that her son told her before he came to work at 
the preschool their family had operated for decades that he loved children. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he felt very comfortable, that he enjoyed working with children and 
felt children accepted him," she testified. "He did not always feel that way 
about adults. The children liked him for what he was." 
</P>
<P>
Her son was able to "get down to a child's level," she said, explaining that, 
to her, that meant not acting superior to his young charges. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said that before and during the three years her son worked at the 
nursery school, she was aware that he was a troubled young man. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray was trying to find himself," she said. "He had low self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trusted Her Son 
</P>
<P>
Buckey insisted, however, that "I wouldn't have had my son there (at the 
preschool) if I didn't trust him." She strongly denied neighbors' accounts, 
presented by the prosecution, that he screamed in the school yard that she was 
a horrible mother, that he threatened to kill her, that he broadcast his misery 
and shouted obscenities saying his parents had messed up his life. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin asked 
Buckey if she thought there was anything wrong with her son allowing children 
to sit on his lap. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said no, but confirmed that on one occasion she had checked to see if 
her son had become aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"One time when he had first started (teaching) in 1981 and children were 
crawling all over him, when he stood up I looked," Buckey testified. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said the only reason she checked was because a father, who objected to 
males teaching at the preschool, had complained. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to think like other people think," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said she would not have tolerated her son molesting children, saying 
that if parents had confronted her with such allegations, "I would have called 
my son in and talked to him and I would have fired him and told him to get 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey herself denied during direct testimony that she had ever molested a 
child.

TRANSIENT ARRESTED IN FIRE AT PAN PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 42-year-old transient has been arrested as a suspect in connection with an 
arson fire that destroyed Los Angeles' historic Pan Pacific Auditorium a week 
ago, investigators announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Fire Chief Donald Manning said the suspect, identified as 
Mark Kamansky, was arrested Sunday afternoon in a park next to the charred 
ruins of the auditorium after he told investigators that he had entered the 
shuttered building on several occasions and had set "more than one fire" 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities did not say that they were actively seeking further 
suspects, Battalion Chief Henry Ed Allen acknowledged that "we're looking for 
acquaintances." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motive Is Unclear 
</P>
<P>
"He did confess that he'd set more than one fire in the structure," Manning 
said. "He did not give us a motive and we have not developed one for him yet." 
</P>
<P>
Manning, who said that the suspect "lived in an automobile," emphasized that 
"we have quite a bit of work ahead of us before we can actually file on this 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Parks Police Capt. Manuel Cisneros said Kamansky -- who told 
officers that he was living in Pan Pacific Park -- was detained Sunday by a 
parks officer until arson investigators arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Under law, investigators have 48 hours to file charges against Kamansky, who is 
being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. If charges are not filed within that 
period, he would have to be released, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect is due out at 4 p.m. (today)," said Los Angeles County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert Savitt. "That means they have until then to put together all 
their information, present it to me, and I will make a decision one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
But in a brief statement at the news conference, an optimistic Mayor Tom 
Bradley said that authorities had made "a good arrest and we're looking forward 
to completion of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators said they are not concerned that the circumstances of the 
arrest are similar to an embarrassing arrest made in the wake of the 1986 fire 
that destroyed the Los Angeles Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exaggerated Confession 
</P>
<P>
In that case, a 28-year-old Hollywood man was arrested after making statements 
to acquaintances and investigators that amounted to a confession. After his 
arrest, the suspect insisted his remarks had been exaggerations, and his 
attorney insisted that the man was the type of person who liked to "color 
events." After several days, the district attorney's office decided not to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after the Pan Pacific fire, arson investigators had alerted county 
parks officers to be on the lookout for transients matching descriptions 
provided by witnesses at the fire scene. Cisneros said that Parks Officer Keith 
Slack was patrolling the north end of the park at 3:30 p.m. Sunday when a 
"patron told Slack that a male transient was in the playground area exposing 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
In a field interview with Slack, Kamansky -- who fit the description provided 
by witnesses -- said that he "lived in the park" and that "he was in the 
building when the fire started," Cisneros said. Slack called arson 
investigators, Cisneros added, "who told him to detain the suspect at the 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
When an arson team arrived a few minutes later, Kamansky told them that "a 
white male and female were inside the building with him and that the three of 
them started the fires," Cisneros said. Kamansky then was booked, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spectacular Blaze 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out in the southwest corner of the vacant entertainment center 
shortly after 7 p.m. last Wednesday. Flames from the building at 7600 Beverly 
Blvd. shot 200 feet into air, creating a tremendous traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators earlier ruled out as a suspect a man who appeared to have 
suffered slight burns and smoke inhalation from the fire and then disappeared 
into the crowd before he could receive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after the fire, Mattie, a specially trained Labrador retriever, 
sniffed out the presence of a flammable liquid on the floor of the building. 
Mattie's handler, a Connecticut State Police trooper, said she is one of five 
such dogs working with fire departments in the United States.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW MONITORS OKD FOR CHILD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday approved creation of an 11-member 
board to recommend ways to improve collection of child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Support Advisory Board is the outgrowth of a recent report showing 
that the district attorney's office, with almost 300,000 active child-support 
cases, has one of the worst collection rates in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay told supervisors that his office is 
installing a new computer system to help track parents who fail to make their 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
The board accepted the recommendation of Susan Speir, founder of Single Parent 
United 'n' Kids, that the panel of seven private citizens and four county 
officials report to supervisors instead of just the district attorney. "The 
district attorney is the problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A report released by a coalition of women's groups in February said that three 
out of four women who ask the district attorney's office to obtain orders 
forcing fathers to pay child support never get one.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PALMDALE OFFERED AS "SUPER TRAIN" STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to ask a 
California-Nevada transportation committee to consider the Palmdale Regional 
Airport as a station site on the proposed high-speed train route from Southern 
California to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Nevada Super-Speed Ground Transportation Commission is studying 
a rail line that would link the two states by a "super train." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Palmdale Regional Airport is now unused, the City Council voted to 
become involved in the process of providing possible train service to the site 
to keep alive its options in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Airports hopes to revive the Palmdale terminal 
and to build an international airport there someday. The agency sees the train 
proposal as a means of solving one of the site's chief problems, its distance 
from the city.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine University in Malibu has announced that it has received $135 million 
in gifts and pledges as part of its "Wave of Excellence" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The final total, which far exceeded the campaign's stated goal of $100 million 
to fund new construction and academic programs on campus, was announced at the 
Pepperdine Associates Dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel last week. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign began in May, 1984. University officials said the campaign reached 
its goal 18 months ahead of schedule.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING UPHOLDS TENANTS' CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that a Van Nuys firm that 
sells information on prospective tenants to landlords must stop reporting on 
eviction cases that were dismissed or withdrawn before going to trial. Judge 
Jerry K. Fields issued a summary judgment that prevents U. D. Registry from 
listing eviction cases that were dismissed. Fields' ruling came in a case filed 
in 1987 on behalf of nine tenants who claim they have been denied housing based 
on the information contained in U. D. Registry reports. A trial for damages in 
the case is to begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
David S. Pallack, an attorney with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal 
Services of Pacoima, said the ruling was a "significant advance" for tenant 
rights. He said state and federal laws prohibit reporting eviction cases won by 
the tenant. Dismissal of a case, which allows the tenant to stay on at the 
rented residence, should be considered the same as a tenant victory, Pallack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Saltz, owner of U. D. Registry, said he plans to appeal the ruling.

AMERICA FACES HEAT FROM MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS AT HIGH-LEVEL CONFERENCE

<P>
The Bush Administration appears to be heading into a barrage of criticism from 
its major economic allies over its decision to threaten Japan and other 
countries with possible retaliation if they do not eliminate trade barriers 
that the United States calls "unfair." 
</P>
<P>
The assault is expected to come this week at the annual ministerial-level 
meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, a forum of industrialized countries. The 24-country session begins 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a strong backlash over the new U.S. trade actions came as 
Japan's trade minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, met informally Tuesday with U.S. 
Trade Representative Carla A. Hills to repeat his earlier assertion that Japan 
"has no intention of negotiating" with the United States "in the context of" 
the retaliation that Washington has threatened under the 1988 Omnibus Trade 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meetings Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
Later this week, Cabinet-level officials from Japan and Western Europe are 
expected to push through strong language chiding the United States in the 
formal communique that the ministers will issue at the end of their annual 
spring meeting. The document has no force of law, but the criticism would 
amount to a diplomatic rebuke of the United States' new, more aggressive trade 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Hills and several other 
high-level U.S. officials are scheduled to meet with their Japanese 
counterparts here today to discuss a separate U.S. proposal to engage Japan in 
wide-ranging talks aimed at dealing with structural impediments to freer trade 
in both countries. Today's meeting will be the first time that the two sides 
have gotten together since the United States announced its trade actions last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes that the broad talks it has proposed -- suggested by 
Brady -- would deal with such issues as the closed nature of Japan's 
product-distribution system, the inability of Americans to save what they need 
to invest in new plants and equipment and ways to coordinate broad economic 
policies. These are factors that many economists believe lie at the heart of 
the trade imbalance between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Japan will agree to hold such talks, at 
least until its government gets over its annoyance at being accused publicly of 
employing "unfair" trading practices. Besides Japan, the United States last 
week also cited Brazil and India for maintaining allegedly unfair trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also is expected to run into conflicts with West Germany and 
Japan over Washington's push to persuade those countries to take new measures 
to help speed up the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit. The Bush 
Administration wants them to spur more domestic demand -- which it hopes would 
lead to increased buying of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
But both countries, along with Britain, contend that they cannot act right now 
because inflationary pressures are mounting at home and would be heightened 
further if authorities took new steps to increase domestic demand. U.S. 
officials concede that there is little support among other OECD members for the 
U.S. position. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hills began what is expected to be a concerted U.S. effort to 
deflect criticism of the Administration's new trade moves, saying at a news 
conference attended mainly by European reporters that Washington has said only 
that it wants to negotiate with Japan, India and Brazil and has not yet 
retaliated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Rules Blamed 
</P>
<P>
"I am an undying optimist by nature, and I believe that we will have some 
fruitful discussions," she said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade complaints against Japan, announced by the Administration last 
Thursday, cited Tokyo on three counts: stringent government procurement 
regulations that prohibit the purchase of U.S.-made supercomputers; similar 
restrictions on buying American-produced satellites, and excessively strict 
lumber standards that effectively bar the import of American forest products. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has also cited Japan for refusing to open its telecommunications 
channels to foreign producers of cellular telephones and mobile radios. The 
United States has also launched proceedings against Brazil, for restricting 
import and export licenses to keep foreign goods out, and against India, for 
restricting foreign investment and sales of insurance policies by foreign 
underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. trading partners, including Japan and the European Community, 
contend that the U.S. action is illegal under international trade rules and 
have threatened to challenge such U.S. "unilateralism" under the Geneva-based 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-country compact that administers 
global trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
Under international rules, countries having trade disputes with other 
governments are expected to take their complaints to GATT. The U.S. law was 
passed by Congress last year as part of an effort to require the Administration 
to "get tough" on accused trade violators. 
</P>
<P>
For all the apparent backlash over last week's U.S. action, the cases the 
Administration used in citing Japan actually were relatively mild ones that 
U.S. authorities thought could be resolved easily. Bush's own national security 
advisers were against hitting Japan too hard for fear of weakening the 
U.S.-Japanese political alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the other issues, this week's ministerial-level meeting of OECD 
countries is expected to provide added political impetus to the Third World 
debt-reduction plan that Brady proposed earlier this year and the Uruguay Round 
of global trade-liberalization talks now under way in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers also are expected to issue a statement bolstering earlier calls 
by their governments for concerted action to deal with urgent environmental 
matters -- from global warming to problems with holes in the earth's ozone 
layer.

A RADICAL 'INFILTRATED' A FORD PLANT IN 1971. HE'S STILL THERE, BUT HE NO 
LONGER DREAMS OF A MARXIST REVOLUTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Feldman, like so many other '60s radicals, has found that life has not 
been what he expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Revolution never came. Slowly, one by one, the members of his generation of 
rebellion drifted away from the cause, slipping into law school or banking, 
finally disappearing into the pinstripes of yuppiedom. 
</P>
<P>
But somehow, Rich Feldman got left behind. And thereby hangs a fascinating tale 
of a stubborn '60s Marxist who wanted to change the world by mobilizing the 
working class but who ended up joining the working class instead. 
</P>
<P>
Now 40, Feldman still clings to his ideals, but for the last 18 years, he's 
been doing his believing on the assembly line at Ford's Wayne, Mich., truck 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Feldman has co-authored a book about life in the Wayne plant called 
"End of the Line," one of the few books ever written by an auto worker about 
auto workers. For Feldman, the "oral history" is "a way to validate the last 18 
years of my life." Perhaps eventually it will provide him a steppingstone out 
of the plant and into the kind of life of the mind he had always expected for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto Workers Unenthusiastic 
</P>
<P>
But today, Feldman works away in the paint shop on Wayne's assembly line and 
has become something of a living museum piece, one of the last remnants of a 
more innocent time when romantic radicals looked to the working class for 
revolutionary change -- and came away sorely disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
He first hired into the plant in 1971 as part of a small cadre of student 
radicals trying to infiltrate industrial America in search of masses to be 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman quickly discovered, however, that American auto workers weren't waiting 
for a revolution, and many weren't particularly happy about having a "Commie" 
in their midst. All they really wanted, he said he discovered, was a raise in 
order to buy a new van or boat. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it was naive," Feldman concedes now. "I thought the workers could 
make a difference. I didn't realize how deep-seated materialism was in American 
society, not just in the middle class, but in the working class as well." 
</P>
<P>
He knows all of that about blue-collar workers now, because he is one of them. 
Today, he, too, goes to work on the line at Ford each day looking for a 
paycheck. Like so many other young workers who have entered America's auto 
factories planning on a short stay, Feldman found the money too good to ever 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear to me after three or four years that the workers weren't 
interested in organizing," recalls Feldman. "Why did I stay? It was 
convenient." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman's story of radicalism and final accommodation began in 1967, on the Ann 
Arbor campus of the University of Michigan -- the real life alma mater of Tom 
Hayden, and, perhaps fittingly, the fictional alma mater of the cast of "The 
Big Chill." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Arbor was then a hotbed of anti-war activism; it was here that Hayden had 
helped forge the radical Students for a Democratic Society just a few years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, then a freshman from Brooklyn, was quickly caught up in the anti-war 
protests, and by the spring of 1968 found himself on the presidential campaign 
staff of Sen. Eugene McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
After working as a field organizer for McCarthy in primaries in Indiana, 
Oregon, Nebraska and New Jersey, Feldman went to the Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago. The experience changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
As a McCarthy worker, he watched, sickened, as the Chicago police began beating 
up demonstrators in Grant Park. He quit McCarthy's staff on the spot, and went 
into Grant Park to join the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radical Activities Increased 
</P>
<P>
"That was an important turning point in my life," Feldman says now. "I was 
deciding to work outside of the system, rather than inside of it." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Ann Arbor, Feldman joined SDS, moved into Marxism, and, for the next 
two years, participated in increasingly radical actions. He helped take over 
the ROTC building at Michigan, and was repeatedly arrested during protests 
against the war, against Dow Chemical, against General Electric, against Chase 
Manhattan Bank and for the Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1970, Feldman, who had stopped his formal schooling, joined a group 
of 35 Ann Arbor radicals who moved to Detroit to take their message to the 
working class. Like others on the left fringe of the anti-war movement around 
the country, they felt the only way to bring about true change in America was 
to take the movement beyond the campus and into the heartland -- "to the point 
of production," as Feldman says now. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in going into the plants was to learn from the people, to learn about 
life and what was necessary to contribute to change, and to get the workers 
involved in overthrowing the entire system," he adds. "We were part of a long 
tradition of radical intellectuals going to the workers with their ideas to 
bring about revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a confidence," he adds, "that bordered on arrogance that we could 
change the world." 
</P>
<P>
Together, all 35 rented a house in Detroit, and began looking for factory jobs. 
There were plenty back then, and several members of the group were soon on the 
inside of General Motors, Chrysler -- and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept quiet until I had my 90 days in and I was off probation," says Feldman. 
"But starting on the 91st day, I was completely honest with the company and the 
union, and everyone, about why I was there." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Feldman and a few other young workers started an independent newsletter 
to expose problems in the plant and to bring to light cases of racism and 
sexism. In the process, Feldman said, he became "one of the most written-up 
workers at Ford" and was cited for insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the radical group's plans to free the workers from their chains never 
got off the ground. The workers weren't listening. Feldman recalls sitting in 
the plant cafeteria as his co-workers hurled names like "Commie" in his face. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned to Other Causes 
</P>
<P>
"By about 1974 or 1975, I came to the conclusion that the capitalist culture 
was not just ingrained in the top executive ranks of corporations but in all 
Americans," says Feldman. "I realized that people really would trade their 
lives for dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, Feldman's group broke up, but a few members, like Feldman, stayed in 
their factory jobs; he claims that some are still working at other auto plants. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that his co-workers weren't interested, Feldman eventually turned his 
attention to outside causes, getting involved in community groups and social 
programs. He stayed on at Ford because it was a good way to make enough money 
to pay his bills -- he now has a wife and two children -- and it also gave him 
enough free time to pursue outside interests. 
</P>
<P>
As he grew older, he said, another reason for staying was that he found the 
factory was like a window into the American soul. He finally put that sense of 
the working man to good use in his book, which gives an unfiltered account of 
life on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman now would like to leave the factory and teach. He hasn't made much 
money from his book, which hasn't sold all that well since it was published 
late last year. Written with Detroit writer Michael Betzold, it was well 
received by Feldman's co-workers, he said, but has had limited distribution 
outside the Detroit area. 
</P>
<P>
But while he may have tired of the line, 18 years at Wayne haven't squeezed all 
of the idealism out of Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
He now hopes for an "American Revolution" of individuals -- change taking place 
one, person at a time. Now he works with community groups to improve Detroit, 
fighting the twin scourges of crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But he now knows not to look to Marxist theory for change -- or to expect 
conservative workers on a truck assembly line at Ford to become the shock 
troops of a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, I was providing simple answers to complex questions, but the 
dreams and idealism were real," he observes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a different sense of time now. I don't think the revolution is going to 
come tomorrow."

JAMES FLANIGAN: ONE BREAK AND MEXICO WILL BE READY TO BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid all the news of global change these days, a story that often isn't in the 
headlines could provide one of the bigger surprises of the next decade: the 
coming prosperity of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The talk in New York financial circles is that Mexico is the next hot country, 
the rapid developer of the 1990s as were the newly industrializing countries of 
Asia -- South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong -- in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has more potential than all the other developing countries put 
together," says a Wall Street investment banker, reflecting widely held 
opinion. It has a disciplined labor force, able and willing workers -- and lots 
more of them. 
</P>
<P>
New York's confidence is matched in Mexico City. "We're going to have a boom," 
says John Rhoads, a former Californian who heads CBI Casa de Bolsa, a major 
investment house in Mexico City. Mexico's economic growth, based on the 
predictions of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, could speed up to more than 
7% a year -- from practically no growth since 1982. "We're heading into another 
cycle of optimism," says Rhoads. 
</P>
<P>
But "another cycle" are the operative words there. Mexico has boomed before, 
especially in the 1970s after major new oil discoveries. And it has gone bust 
before -- severely in this decade, when living standards have been cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
So how much of today's confidence reflects reality? And why should Americans 
care, when they have their own troubles with far larger economies in Japan and 
Europe? 
</P>
<P>
Americans should care because a neighboring country of 85 million people holds 
enormous implications for the United States. First, it's a great customer. In 
1981, before its economy declined, Mexico took $20 billion of U.S. exports -- 
as much as Japan that year. Last year, even with a stagnant economy, Mexico 
took $23 billion of U.S. goods, far more than any of the smaller Asian nations, 
and 75% of what Japan bought. Real development in Mexico would provide a big 
and growing market for U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Investment 
</P>
<P>
Also its development would provide opportunity for investment -- and put to 
useful purpose some of the billions now rocketing around the global money 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has a long history of foreign investment. First it brought in too much, 
from Britain and America during the 19th-Century regime of Porfirio Diaz. The 
money led eventually to revolution and a reaction against foreign ownership 
that was capped by the seizure of U.S.-owned oil properties in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 50 years later, policies against foreign investment are being relaxed by 
the Salinas government, which recently announced limited openings for foreign 
ownership. Ultimately, Salinas -- who stresses the fact that his two sons are 
studying the Japanese language -- wants to attract sizable foreign investments. 
</P>
<P>
They will be needed, among other things, to help expand and modernize the 
telephone system. D. A. Campbell Inc., a Los Angeles investment company that 
specializes in Mexican securities, estimates that Telefonos Mexicanos, the 
national telephone company, will have to increase its current $1-billion annual 
capital investment by 10% a year in the next decade just to keep up with 
expanding demand. Yet despite such needs, TelMex stock has been rising in both 
Mexican and U.S. trading because it is seen as a symbol of the country's 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, confidence in that potential is more political than economic, 
resting largely on the performance of the Salinas government. Salinas, who is 
only 40 years old, won the Mexican election last year with a narrow majority, 
because powerful unions -- particularly the corrupt oil workers union -- swung 
their votes to another candidate. Derided as "the mouse" by political 
commentators in Mexico City, Salinas took office amid expectations that he 
would be too weak to rule. 
</P>
<P>
But he turned apparent weakness into strength. He used the oil workers 
defection from Mexico's ruling party as a weapon against them, moving boldly to 
arrest the head of the union. Other moves followed, asserting presidential 
authority over labor and business. 
</P>
<P>
Yet still, the Mexican economy is growing at a rate of less than 1% a year and 
Mexican business, to say nothing of foreigners, are reluctant to invest. At 
least $25 billion of Mexican capital remains outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
What's the economy waiting for? It's waiting for some sign of success in June 
as Mexico once again renegotiates terms of more than $50 billion of its foreign 
debt with international banks. It has had such negotiations every year since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, is different. This year, Mexico's request for debt 
reduction -- for the opportunity to give the banks long-term bonds in exchange 
for its loans -- has the backing of the U.S. Treasury, which has announced a 
policy favoring debt reduction. Success in the negotiations could reduce 
Mexico's interest payments by $3 billion a year and, more important, attract 
back Mexican capital and new foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next month must come the solution," said Mexico's leading newspaper 
Excelsior Monday. If it does, confidence in Mexico will be more than just talk.

Anti-Cancer Drug Backed: Cetus Corp.'s anti-cancer drug Proleukin interleukin-2 
has been recommended for approval by the European Economic Community's 
committee for proprietary medicinal products. The drug is used in treatment of 
advanced kidney cancer. The role of the committee, which meets in Brussels on a 
regular basis, is to act as a centralized body for review of applications for 
approval of biotech and high-tech drugs and to issue an opinion regarding drug 
approval. The company said it also applied in November for marketing approval 
of Proleukin with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury sold $6.4 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 8.5%, up from 8.32% last week. Another $6.4 billion 
of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.36%, up from 
8.33% last week. The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 
8.64% on May 1 and six-month bills averaged 8.39% on May 8. The new discount 
rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.81% for three-month bills, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,785.10, and 8.85% for a six-month bill 
selling for $9,577.40. The discount rate reflects the price discount received 
when government securities are purchased at less than face value.

<P>
SALES OF NEW HOMES SURGE 10.9% IN APRIL 
</P>

<P>
Sales of new homes were up a strong 10.9% in April, the Commerce Department 
said Tuesday, but housing economists say the industry will remain sluggish at 
least into summer because of high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in sales to 620,000 units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis 
was due to an aberration in sales in February and March, when sales dropped 
10.9% and 10.4% respectively, the economists said. 
</P>
<P>
The April increase was the steepest since a 13.9% jump in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were divided over how soon the housing market would pick up. 
</P>
<P>
"We view the market tone as generally weakening," said David Seiders, chief 
economist for the National Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for further weakening in certainly the third quarter, perhaps 
the fourth as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn., said 
although the industry "still is in a slowing trend," the second quarter will be 
the "trough." 
</P>
<P>
"As lower interest rates kick in, sales will increase as the summer goes on," 
Peach said. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgage interest reached a peak of 11.22% in March and began to 
drop in April, averaging between 10.99% and 11.11%, according to a weekly 
national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects More Activity 
</P>
<P>
Rates had been rising for more than a year as the Federal Reserve tightened 
credit in an attempt to stem inflation. 
</P>
<P>
David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Assn., said 
he thinks that housing activity will increase if mortgage rates continue to 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect a tremendous surge in housing activity, but we do expect it to 
bounce back a little bit from the levels we saw in February and March," he 
said. "We're likely to see new home sales between 600,000 and 650,000 (on a 
seasonally adjusted annual basis) over the next several months." 
</P>
<P>
The April sales level compares to new home purchases totaling 676,000 in 1988 
and 671,000 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, also sees a 
slight pickup in sales activity later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate new home sales will pick up slightly during the second half of 
1989, ending the year with a sales total of about 640,000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The West paced the April rebound with a 31.3% increase in sales to 193,000. It 
was followed by a 21.2% jump to 234,000 units in the South. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 6.8% to 96,000 homes in the Midwest and 17.2%, also to 96,000, in 
the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in sales in the Northeast, where housing costs generally are 
highest, was the major cause for a $9,000 drop in the median price of homes to 
$117,000 last month, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first median-price decline since a $2,500 decrease last November. 
The median price represents the level where half of the homes cost more and 
half less. 
</P>
<P>
The average price, which is affected by sales of expensive homes, totaled 
$145,700 in April, down $4,800 from the previous month.

Trump Shuttle Picks Ad Agency: It didn't take long for the Trump Shuttle to 
shuttle in a new ad agency. The former Eastern Airlines Northeast Shuttle, 
which real estate developer Donald J. Trump gained control of last week, named 
the New York ad firm Scali, McCabe, Sloves Inc. as its agency of record. The 
agency, which creates ads for Perdue Chicken and Volvo, plans to begin an ad 
campaign within the next few weeks. Although the agency won't say, many expect 
the new campaign to focus on the reduced rates the shuttle plans to charge -- 
and Trump himself is expected to play a prominent role in the ads.

PEOPLE: QINTEX UNIT'S CHIEF NAMED UA PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Evans, president and chief executive of Beverly Hills-based Qintex 
Entertainment, has been named to those positions at its successor, United 
Artists Corp. Australian-owned Qintex is acquiring the major Hollywood studio 
as part of the $1-billion purchase of MGM/UA Communications, which will be 
completed this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who came to this country from Australia five years ago, also named four 
key executives at UA. Not surprisingly, three of the appointees are from the 
MGM/UA ranks and one is from Qintex. All have participated in managing UA since 
the acquisition was announced March 31, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Berger, president of the MGM/UA film group, holds the same title at UA. 
Steve Mills, formerly senior executive vice president-programming at Qintex, 
has been named president of the UA television production group. David M. 
Forbes, MGM/UA marketing and distribution president, moves to the same position 
at UA. John Goldwyn, previously MGM/UA executive vice president, was promoted 
to president-production of UA's film group. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Entertainment Chairman Christopher Skase, who controls its parent, 
Australian TV broadcaster Qintex Group, signed a definitive agreement to buy 
MGM/UA from its 82% owner, Kirk Kerkorian. The agreement calls for Kerkorian to 
buy back the MGM name and some other assets for $250 million. Kerkorian has 
said he will make films with a new MGM. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the deal, Kerkorian also will be Skase's business associate. He 
is to invest $75 million in Qintex group. Further, UA will distribute films 
made by the new MGM, as well as from the 34-title, post-1986 MGM library. 
Qintex will own the UA library, including the 1989 Academy Award-winning "Rain 
Man." Turner Broadcasting purchased the old MGM library in 1985 from Kerkorian.

PEOPLE: JESSE JACKSON'S SON RESIGNS FROM DREXEL INTERNSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson resigned his summer internship at Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s Beverly Hills-based "junk bond" office Tuesday, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Luther Jackson, second son of the former Democratic presidential 
candidate, was an intern in the credit research department, said Drexel 
spokesman Steve Anreder. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been there for awhile but he decided to leave," Anreder said. "He's got 
some personal family matters to attend to." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman didn't say when Jackson started the internship. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson planned to be a graduate student in business at Northwestern University 
in Chicago in the fall, Anreder said. His resume shows him to be a graduate of 
North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University. 
</P>
<P>
His Drexel employment was reported in the May 26 issue of Grant's Interest Rate 
Observer, an investor newsletter covering credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel agreed in January to pay the government $650 million to settle civil 
charges of insider trading.

PACIFIC BELL USERS WILL GET $5-MILLION REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Pacific Bell's rural customers are expected to share about $5 
million in refunds this summer under a quietly negotiated tentative settlement 
of a complaint accusing the company of charging customers for push-button 
telephone service that it never provided. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed settlement in 
secret session on Friday but issued no press release, apparently at Pacific 
Bell's request. The action comes less than three years after the PUC ordered 
the phone company to refund millions of dollars to customers pressured into 
buying services that they neither needed nor wanted. 
</P>
<P>
For the $5-million settlement, Pacific Bell customers can thank George Sawaya, 
a retired senior auditor in the Downey office of the State Board of 
Equalization. A resident of the Sierra foothill hamlet of Pollock Pines since 
1981, Sawaya has led the three-year battle for compensation for the wrongly 
charged phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
As Sawaya explained Tuesday, he decided to sign up for Pacific Bell's "Touch 
Tone" service in 1985 after the company sent him, along with his monthly phone 
bill, a list of available extra services and their prices. The mailing said 
Touch Tone service "places your calls faster than a rotary-dial phone can," a 
feature that Sawaya wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Marketing Abuse' Charged 
</P>
<P>
But after Sawaya paid a $5 sign-up charge for the service and agreed to pay an 
extra $1.20 a month for it, he found no improvement. After calling Pacific 
Bell's local office, he learned that the older, non-digital switch serving much 
of El Dorado County could not provide full Touch Tone service. He cancelled the 
service and Pacific Bell refunded his payments. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Sawaya said, he thought about his neighbors served by the same 
electromechanical switch, along with the 30% of Pacific Bell customers then 
served by similar equipment. So in January, 1986, he filed a class-action 
complaint with the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
At the subsequent hearing, Sawaya described the literature describing Touch 
Tone as "deceptive or misleading." He called it "a form of marketing abuse not 
unlike others which have recently been under consideration by the Public 
Utilities Commission." 
</P>
<P>
Sawaya was referring to a PUC finding in August, 1986, that Pacific Bell had 
intentionally engaged in abusive sales techniques. Among other things, its 
agents, working under a quota system, improperly sold basic telephone service 
with such extras as call-forwarding and call-waiting. Some customers claimed 
that the Pacific Bell sales pitches misled them into believing that such 
services were not available individually or that they could not get basic 
telephone service without them. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC made Pacific Bell offer refunds, at a cost to the company of more than 
$40 million, to affected customers. It also was required to contribute to a 
consumer-education fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sawaya Persevered 
</P>
<P>
A major difference between the marketing-abuse case and the recent one, Sawaya 
pointed out, was that in the first case the company was at least providing the 
services for which it was billing customers. 
</P>
<P>
At Sawaya's 1986 hearing, a senior Pacific Bell engineer, Loren Wedel, 
testified that there was no physical change in Sawaya's service as a result of 
his having signed up for Touch Tone service. Only billing records were changed, 
the engineer confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the PUC dismissed the case on the technical grounds that because 
Sawaya had obtained a refund, he could not intervene on behalf of other 
customers in a class-action complaint. Undeterred, Sawaya asked for a 
rehearing.

That rehearing petition was dismissed behind closed doors on Friday. But in 
exchange, Pacific Bell assured the commissioners that it would submit a plan to 
refund "about $5 million" to customers in Sawaya's circumstances -- a 
settlement Sawaya viewed "positively." It also agreed not to charge them in the 
future for Touch Tone service, which is now available to Pollock Pines 
customers.

PEOPLE: IBM HONORS KUEHLER BY GIVING HIM TITLE OF PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
International Business Machines gave its No. 2 executive, Jack D. Kuehler, the 
title of president Tuesday in a move designed to recognize the one-time 
engineer's long service to the huge computer company. 
</P>
<P>
The switch, company officials said, is not expected to change either IBM's 
daily operations or the long-range strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehler, who holds degrees in electrical and mechanical engineering, rose 
through the company's technical ranks and joined the board in January, 1986. He 
has served as IBM's vice chairman since January, 1988, and has been responsible 
for overseeing IBM's sprawling U.S. operations. As president, his duties will 
be little changed. 
</P>
<P>
IBM Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Akers, 54, was the last IBM executive 
to hold the presidency, but of late, the post has been vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kuehler's new title recognizes his individual achievement, it does not 
settle the issue of who will replace Akers upon his retirement. IBM does not 
have a mandatory retirement age, but top executives have traditionally given up 
their jobs at age 60. A company spokesman said Kuehler, who turns 57 in August, 
is expected to remain with the company about three more years, while Akers 
could serve as chairman another six years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a succession-oriented announcement; it is a recognition-oriented 
announcement," the spokesman said. "This is flattering, positive recognition 
for Jack Kuehler and his 31-year career at IBM. . . . Jack has been in the No. 
2 position and he will continue to be." 
</P>
<P>
An IBM spokesman said the plan to name Kuehler president came from Akers, who 
wanted to give Kuehler a title that reflected a "more active" involvement in 
the day-to-day operations of the company than vice chairman. The position of 
vice chairman will be left vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehler is known within IBM as a technology expert in contrast to Akers, whose 
main strength is in marketing. Educated at Santa Clara University, Kuehler 
began with the company as an associate engineer at the San Jose Research 
Laboratory in 1958. He was elected to the board in 1986 and appointed executive 
vice president in March, 1987, before becoming vice chairman last year.

'TRUMP SHUTTLE' NAME ALREADY USED, FIRM SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Donald J. Trump may have purchased Eastern Airlines' shuttle, but a Washington 
company says it has the legal rights to the name "Trump Shuttle" and is 
prepared to fight him in court for it. 
</P>
<P>
A federal bankruptcy court last week approved the sale of Eastern's shuttle 
service between New York, Washington and Boston to Trump for $365 million, and 
Trump said he hoped to begin flights early next month as the Trump Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
But the International Trading &amp; Finance Corp. of Washington says it has 
filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for rights to the name Trump 
Shuttle for its division that provides transportation and storage for artwork 
and other items sent to or from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
ITFC President Michael Fracassi said the name comes from the company's slogan, 
"Play your trump card -- use the Trump Shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Frivolous' 
</P>
<P>
"My attorneys feel we have every right to use that name," Fracassi said in an 
interview. "We're prepared to do battle with him (Trump)." 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is frivolous," Bruce Nobles, president of Donald Trump's Trump 
Shuttle, said in response to ITFC's claim. He said the Trump Shuttle was 
incorporated last October by the Trump Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Fracassi's attorneys wrote Nobles on May 26 stating that the use of the name 
Trump Shuttle would infringe on ITFC's rights and would cause customer 
confusion. ITFC has listed the Trump Shuttle in the Washington telephone 
directory with its number and registered the name in New York State as its 
service mark. 
</P>
<P>
Nobles said he could not comment on the letter because he had not received it.

A furor over a media leak of the Canadian budget widened as journalists and 
opposition parties expressed outrage that a reporter has been accused in the 
affair. Television journalist Doug Small was formally charged with possession 
of stolen budget documents. Small, who said he obtained the documents from a 
source after a clandestine meeting at an Ottawa gas station, broadcast details 
of the budget on the evening before it was to be presented to Parliament. Four 
others were also charged.

Hungary's Communist Party has concluded that the execution of Premier Imre Nagy 
after the 1956 uprising was a "criminal act" and expressed hope that his 
reburial will be a cause for national reconciliation. The decision by the 
party's 118-member Central Committee overturned more than three decades of 
official party dogma. Party spokesman Laszlo Major told a news conference in 
Budapest that Nagy was given a "fabricated political trial" and said his 
"execution was certainly judicially illegal." Nagy's body was exhumed from an 
unmarked grave March 29 for reburial on June 16.

Black recipients of donor kidneys fare as well as whites, a transplant doctor 
reported at the annual meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians 
in Chicago. His report contradicted other studies that have found blacks tend 
to do much worse after such surgery. "Even in our program, back in 1982, 1983, 
1984, they (blacks) did a little worse. Lately, they don't, and overall they do 
as well as whites," said Dr. Ingemar Dawidson, associate professor of surgery 
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Dr. Clive O. 
Callender, head of the Howard University Hospital Transplant Center, said 
studies encompassing larger pools of patients show kidney transplants are 10% 
to 20% less successful in blacks than whites.

The state Commission on Judicial Performance said it has filed misconduct

they do not include a publicized allegation that Schmidt gave favorable 
treatment to a prostitute in exchange for sex. The commission wants to hold a

LOWEST SMOKING RATE SINCE '44 REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cigarette smoking has declined to its lowest level since 1944. In a new Gallup 
survey, 27% of American adults report having smoked cigarettes during the week 
prior to being interviewed. Until this year, smoking had never dropped below 
the 30% mark. Last year 32% identified themselves as smokers. However, the 
trend toward lower rates of consumption -- that is, the tendency of smokers to 
consume fewer cigarettes per day -- appears to have halted. Between 1977 and 
1987, the proportion smoking more than one pack of cigarettes a day fell from 
27% to 18%, while those reporting consumption of less than a pack edged upward, 
from 38% to 48%. Currently, 39% say they smoke less than a pack; another 39%, 
one pack; and 20% more than a pack, almost identical to the figures reported in 
last year's poll. The results are based on telephone interviews with a randomly 
selected national sample of 1,250 adults conducted May 15-18.

The Louisiana House killed a bill that would have abolished state affirmative 
action programs, handing state Rep. David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, 
his first legislative defeat since winning his seat in a special election in 
February. Duke, a Republican from Metairie, branded the House action as 
"cowardice." The measure, which also would have banned state contract set-aside 
programs for minorities, had been approved by a House committee, but the full 
House voted 44 to 41 in a procedural move to table the bill, effectively 
killing it. The motion to table was made by Rep. Mitch Landrieu, a New Orleans 
Democrat whose district contains a large percentage of blacks. Duke vowed to 
fight to have his measure tacked onto another bill as an amendment.

A developer who is building more than 860 apartments in a San Francisco 
neighborhood has hired a consulting firm to help stop a proposed baseball park 
nearby because of possible noise and traffic congestion. The Cleveland-based 
Forest City Development reportedly paid $10,000 to back "San Franciscans for 
Planning Priorities," which describes itself as a community-based movement 
supported by neighborhood activists and environmentalists. The group is urging 
citizens to write Mayor Art Agnos and Spectacor Management Group, a 
Philadelphia firm that is negotiating with the city to develop a ballpark and

Bulgaria took the offensive at the opening session of an international human 
rights conference in Paris by blaming Turkey for recent violence involving 
Bulgaria's ethnic Turks. The monthlong conference, the first of three mandated 
by the Vienna review committee of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, is to review human rights progress among the 35 signatories of the 1975 
Helsinki accords. In one of the first speeches, Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Petur T. Mladenov accused "foreign circles" -- a reference to Turkey -- of 
being behind recent disturbances in his country in which ethnic Turks 
reportedly have been killed. Bulgaria has recently deported an estimated 300 
ethnic Turks.

The government controlled by Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega is holding 
at least 89 political prisoners including opposition party officials, two 
opposition leaders charged. "The prisoners are nothing more than hostages," 
Guillermo Endara, a former opposition presidential candidate, said. Former vice 
presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon added: "For most (of the 89) 
there has been no reply to . . . judicial petitions, showing how deeply the 
judiciary is subordinated to the military dictatorship." Many were accused of 
threatening the security of the state and were sentenced to a year in jail on 
the night they were seized, he said. There was no comment from the government.

The chief judge of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Milwaukee said he 
would begin a review of two cases in which District Judge Thomas J. Curran 
ruled in favor of the General Electric Co. while owning GE stock. The U.S. Code 
of Judicial Ethics forbids a judge from presiding in a case in which he or she 
has a financial holding. The Associated Press discovered the incidents by 
reviewing Curran's financial disclosure statements and cross-referencing his 
stock holdings with his case files. In a telephone interview from Chicago, 
Appeals Judge William J. Bauer said he would probe both cases closely and then 
announce whether any action should be taken. On Friday, Curran, 64, said he 
would notify counsel of the conflicting interest and avoid future involvement 
in cases involving GE.

GRIFFEY JR. IS PUTTING HIMSELF IN DAD'S PLACE

It's not every teen-ager who gets to wander around the outfield at Yankee 
Stadium. Ken Griffey Jr., 19, the youngest player in the major leagues, did 
that Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He knew he was going to play center field in the game, so he worked out there, 
but he also visited left field and right field in the Seattle Mariners' pregame 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
"My father played all three in the years he was here, so I wanted to check out 
what kind of view he had," Griffey Jr. said. He remembered the ninth-inning 
catch his father made in left field to rob Marty Barrett of a home run and save 
a 6-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Griffey Sr. climbed the eight-foot-high fence, made a spectacular grab more 
than 10 feet off the ground, did a backward somersault after coming down and 
held onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I studied the angle he had and tried to figure how high he went," the 
teen-ager said. "I rated him a 10 on the catch and a 2 on the dismount." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey Jr. had been here before, never to roam the field but as one of the 
clubhouse rats. He and his brother, Greg, joined Lou Piniella's son, Jeff 
Torborg's boys and other offspring of Yankees coaches and veteran players in 
passageway games in the catacombs of Yankee Stadium outside the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1983, Billy Martin was managing and it became a bitter memory. "The 
Yankees lost that day and there must have been 10 or 12 of us playing pickle 
when Billy went into the clubhouse," Griffey Jr. said. "He sent somebody to 
tell my father to get his kids out of here. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got home, my father said, 'I'm never bringing my kids back to Yankee 
Stadium.' He was upset because his boys had been singled out of a crowd of 
kids. Mom talked him out of it. She said, 'I'd bring them every day.' " 
</P>
<P>
There would be other visits, more pleasant ones. "Rickey Henderson gave me my 
first talk about baseball other than my father," Griffey Jr. said, recalling a 
more recent memory. "He told me, 'You're going to be here.' He told me to stay 
away from the wrong crowd. He said that if somebody does drugs, his name may 
not be mentioned, but yours will be." 
</P>
<P>
Now Griffey Jr. has his own credentials to enter American League ballparks. It 
comes in the shape of a lithe 6-3 body weighing 190 pounds that's capable of 
making its own great catches. He made one a week ago in Boston that the 
Mariners will remember for some time. 
</P>
<P>
It was the bottom of the ninth in a tie game, and Wade Boggs led off with a 
shot to left-center. The center fielder took off in a graceful gallop. He 
caught the ball with a leap just before his back crashed into the padded wall. 
The problem was that his head bounced off the concrete just above the padding. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey Jr. finished the game, which the Red Sox won, and was taken to the 
hospital for precautionary X-rays. Fortunately, he escaped with a bruise and 
was able to play the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great catch," said Mariners coach Rusty Kuntz, who is working on 
refining Griffey Jr.'s defensive skills. "He realized he's going to have to 
take his lumps. He basically has no fear. That's how a potential great player 
starts out. You just hope he doesn't get hurt or takes unnecessary chances. 
He's so resilient. A ball caught against the wall like he did would take the 
average player out of the lineup a couple of days. He takes that shot and it 
meant nothing to him. He's got that youth going for him." 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed hitter went 1 for 4 against the Yankees Monday, doubling to 
left in his final at-bat. Griffey Jr. also was fined for wearing sneakers to 
the ballpark, which is against the Mariners' dress code on the road. "Me and 
Rickey are going one-on-one," he said. "I got fined $25 for wearing my Nikes." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson declined the basketball challenge. "Rickey said I got too big," 
Griffey Jr. said. "Instead, he invited me to dinner. Maybe we can go one-on-one 
at the All-Star break."

SUPPLIED GUARDS FOR POLLING PLACES; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY FIRM AGREES TO SETTLE IN O.C. VOTER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The security firm hired by the Orange County Republican Party to stop 
non-citizens from voting last fall agreed Tuesday to pay $60,000 to six 
plaintiffs who claimed in a lawsuit that their civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer 
Letts in Santa Ana, was disclosed Tuesday in court. 
</P>
<P>
If accepted by the judge, the settlement will be the first resolution of 
litigation brought in the wake of the poll-guard controversy. The guards caused 
an uproar in one of last November's most bitterly contested Orange County 
elections, leading not only to an FBI investigation but also to the 
introduction of state legislation that would outlaw unsanctioned guards at 
polling places. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged that the guards, who were carrying signs in Spanish warning 
non-citizens not to vote, reportedly intimidated first-time Latino voters and 
may have frightened them away from the polls. The suit asked that the election 
results be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Of the various defendants in the suit, only the security company has settled. 
Letts indicated that he will not permit other defendants, including Assemblymen 
Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) and John Lewis (R-Orange), to make claims that 
the security firm is more at fault than they are and should pay any damages. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, lawyers in the case said, the judge was ruling that the individual 
actions of Saddleback Security Services Corp. employees who may have violated 
the Election Code are a separate issue in regard to whether Pringle, Lewis and 
county Republican Party officials intended to influence the outcome of the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney Kathleen Purcell, who is representing the six 
plaintiffs, said Tuesday that she was pleased with the proposed settlement, 
adding: "It's a fairly substantial sum of money." 
</P>
<P>
But David A. Robinson, attorney for Pringle and Lewis, was irked both by the 
settlement and the judge's statements and said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement shows that the plaintiffs are merely out to put money in their 
pockets," Robinson said. "We also think that the judge is dead wrong. . . . He 
abused his authority" in not allowing the other defendants to make claims 
against Saddleback Security. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Gridley, attorney for Saddleback Security, said the firm agreed to the 
settlement -- without acknowledging any wrongdoing -- out of a realization that 
it was not economical to prolong the dispute. Legal costs, he said, have 
already exceeded the amount of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Gridley said he would file a motion today seeking to have the proposed 
settlement accepted as a "good faith" agreement. The other defendants are 
expected to oppose the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Gridley added: "It was uncontradicted by any party either in oral argument or 
paper work that there was no intent on the part of Saddleback to influence the 
election outcome." 
</P>
<P>
The uniformed guards were stationed at polling places in 20 largely Latino 
precincts in Santa Ana on Election Day. They were hired at the suggestion of a 
political consultant for Pringle, who ended up winning the costly 72nd Assembly 
District election by fewer than 900 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Fuentes, the county Republican chairman who is also a defendant in 
the lawsuit, has said that he authorized about $4,000 in party money to hire 
the guards because of rumors that illegal voters were to be bused in to tip the 
election in favor of the Democratic candidate, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Wold, attorney for the Orange County Republican Party, was unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Orange County controversy, a bill is moving through the 
state Legislature that would prohibit any uniformed security guard or peace 
officer from being within 100 feet of a polling place without the permission of 
the appropriate elections official.

The Polish government intensified its charges that the United States is 
improperly helping Solidarity's election campaign -- an accusation Solidarity 
and U.S. diplomats denied. A State Department spokesman said Congress has 
authorized $2 million for the trade union for two years, but U.S. spokesman 
Richard Boucher said, "We're not interfering with the campaign." After a 
government statement accused Western diplomats of helping the opposition, an 
official spokesman said the "way of behaving of those diplomats unambiguously 
showed that they were taking part in the electoral campaign in favor of the 
opposition."

PEOPLE: DRIVING A PIER TRAM ISN'T ALL BLUE SKY AND SUNSHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The air temperature was 71 degrees. A cobalt sky soared overhead, no clouds in 
sight. The ocean breeze was out of the southeast at 4 m.p.h. Gentle breakers 
carried surfers in Day-Glo wet suits underneath the Seal Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
David Hughes, 25, peered through his wrap-around sunglasses as the tractor 
lurched ahead on the pier at a snail's pace. "Everybody seems to think this is 
a great job," the former South Dakota farmer said, easing past two young women 
in not-quite-wrap-around bikinis. "It's not as easy as it seems. You gotta 
watch out for people." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has a lot on his mind these days as he the beach maintenance worker 
pilots a city tram back and forth on the Seal Beach Pier. About 500 yards long, 
the tricky stretch of wood planking and asphalt can be a treacherous obstacle 
course, Hughes insists. Why, sometimes he even feels anxious. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets really nerve-racking, worse than the freeway," Hughes said, his long, 
blond hair suddenly lifted by the sea breeze. "Sometimes you have a couple 
hundred people out here and it gets pretty crowded. You'd be surprised at how 
reckless people can be." 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough job, but yes, somebody's got to do it. Hughes shares this 
demanding duty with three other city employees. The ride is only a quarter each 
way, children under 7 free. It's the only municipal pier tram service in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes the public can turn on even a mild-mannered tractor jockey such 
as Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
"What'd you do? Get rid of old nasty Harold?" bellowed Harold Hirsch, 78, 
waving a fishing rod in Hughes' direction as he boarded the tram one recent 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah, he's on vacation," said Hughes, who was pitching in this day to cover 
colleague Harold Griffin's shift. "He's in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
"Good, I hope he stays there," said Hirsch, a tram regular. Hughes hollered 
back that not everyone is perfect like Hirsch, who smiled. But only for a 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what you're paid, but it's certainly not hard work," Hirsch said 
with a wink and a grin as the tram eased up in front of Ruby's restaurant at 
the end of the pier. Debbie Dalton, 37, piped in to defend Hughes. "He's nice," 
she said. "I doubt he gets paid enough." 
</P>
<P>
Then everyone clambered off the tram for fishing, lunch or just horsing around 
on another beautiful day. 
</P>
<P>
One more load delivered, Hughes broke for a cigarette. He pondered the pitfalls 
of chauffeuring fishermen, families, oil roughnecks and "smart-aleck" kids at 
this quaint beachside community. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't look forward to summer," the long-suffering Hughes said, grinding 
the cigarette butt into the pier with his tennis shoe. "It can be a real 
headache." 
</P>
<P>
Take the young people who like to race his tram -- top speed of 5 m.p.h. Or the 
ones who will suddenly leap in front of the tractor as he putters peacefully 
along. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never hit anybody," Hughes said, his tone suggesting that some terrible 
and different fate lurks in the future. "I've been pretty lucky. But there's 
always close calls." 
</P>
<P>
The key to tram success, Hughes revealed, is total concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, you don't actually see people," Hughes said. "Just figures. 
You're too busy. You have to have a pretty clear mind." 
</P>
<P>
On a hot and crowded summer day, Hughes said the Seal Beach Pier can be a 
veritable Grand Central Station. 
</P>
<P>
One day he ferried 460 people on a single 10-hour shift, Hughes said. At an 
average of what he calculates were eight runs per hour, that worked out to an 
almost sardine-like half a dozen passengers on the 15-foot-long tram each ride! 
</P>
<P>
"And that was just paying customers," Hughes added. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, even here at the bucolic Seal Beach pier, chiselers sometimes try for a 
free ride. Not everyone puts his 25 cents into the fare collection bin -- 
shaped like an oversize thermos -- that hangs at the end of the tram. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the people who won't pay the quarter," Hughes said, 
shaking his head. "They'll want to fistfight. You just make them look bad in 
front of the other passengers. We're not supposed to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all the gorgeous weather, body-beautiful sun worshipers, high-stress 
crowds and deadbeat customers, Hughes said he probably prefers jockeying the 
Seal Beach tram to the grueling grind of running combines on a South Dakota 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
"The work was too hard and the pay was terrible," Hughes recalled. "There's 
quite a bit of difference." 
</P>

MAN WITH KNIFE ROBS CLOTHING STORE OF $150 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man armed with a fillet knife stole $150 Tuesday from a Costa 
Mesa clothing store, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man walked into Pacific Eyes and T's, 1835 Newport Blvd., brandished the 
knife and ordered the lone clerk to open the cash register, said Lt. Sam 
Cordeiro of the Costa Mesa Police Department. The man then grabbed the money, 
told the clerk to go into the back room and left the business on foot in an 
unknown direction. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as a white male with a tan, 6 feet tall, about 175 
pounds and 25 to 28 years old. 
</P>
<P>
He is possibly the same man involved in two or three similar robberies in the 
city within the past month, Cordeiro said. Police have no leads, he said.

CHASE ENDS IN CRASH; 4 IN STOLEN CAR ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities on Tuesday identified four suspects as the occupants of a stolen 
high-performance car that led police on two separate chases early Monday before 
the car overturned, trapping all four occupants inside. 
</P>
<P>
The first chase began at Brookhurst Street and Warner Avenue in Fountain Valley 
at 3:15 a.m., when police tried to stop the 1989 Chevrolet IROC-Z28 because it 
did not have a license plate, according to Sgt. Larry Griswold of the Fountain 
Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The driver sped away and onto the San Diego Freeway, heading south with police 
in pursuit. The cars reached speeds up to 100 m.p.h. before the driver evaded 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies picked up the chase in Mission Viejo, where it 
ended at 3:48 a.m. when the car rolled over at El Toro Road and Marguerite 
Parkway. Injuries were not serious, Griswold said. The car had been reported 
stolen May 14 in Riverside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police arrested Kevin L. Garrett, 23, of Stanton on suspicion 
of vehicle theft and evading arrest. He was also served with seven unrelated, 
outstanding warrants, including narcotics violations. Bail was set at $22,500. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested on suspicion of vehicle theft was William A. Pinkelman, 21, of 
Garden Grove. His bail was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of joy-riding were Tera L. Kirkland, 18, of Cypress and 
Sherri M. Hewitt, 18, of Garden Grove. They were released.

FBI SAYS 4 MAY FACE FEDERAL CHARGES IN 'SKINHEAD' ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four "skinheads" connected with neo-Nazi groups based in Placentia and Glendale 
may face federal charges in connection with a weekend incident in which a 
Middle Eastern couple and a black man were taunted with racial slurs, kicked 
and pummeled, an FBI spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The four, one of whom is from Yorba Linda, are scheduled to be arraigned on 
local charges this morning in Pomona Municipal Court. They allegedly attacked 
the three Sunday in the parking lot of a La Verne supermarket after shouting 
anti-Semitic epithets. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne police identified the victims only as a 30-year-old Glendora man, his 
28-year-old wife and a 34-year-old Pomona man who was attacked when he came to 
the couple's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to release their names, citing concerns for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon were Scott Wilson, 28, of 
West Covina; Timothy Zaal, 25, of Glendora; William R. Killackey, 21, of Yorba 
Linda, and Killackey's 19-year-old sister, Amy, of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50,000 Bails Set 
</P>
<P>
The three men remained in custody Tuesday at the La Verne Police Station and 
the woman was being held at the Sybil Brand Institute in Los Angeles, Lt. Ken 
Swank said. All are being held in lieu of $50,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Reagan, spokesman for the FBI in Los Angeles, said Tuesday that the agency 
is looking into the incident and that the U.S. attorney's office is expected to 
decide today whether to file federal charges against the four for violating the 
civil rights of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects wore short-cropped hair, black trousers with red 
suspenders and combat boots, identifying them as white supremacist skinheads. 
They allegedly confronted the husband and wife as the couple were carrying 
groceries to their car. Members of the group yelled racial slurs at the woman, 
who was carrying the couple's 2-week-old son, Swank said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like they confronted the first minority people they saw," Swank 
said, adding that the couple are of a Middle Eastern nationality and are not 
Jewish. "They accused (the couple) of bringing another Jewish baby into the 
world. The man said, 'Just leave us alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects then kicked the man in the chest, knocking him to the 
ground, after which the others kicked him as he lay on the pavement, Swank 
said. The man's wife tried to intervene and was punched repeatedly in the face, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Pomona man came to the couple's aid, the suspects shouted racial slurs 
at him and beat him, the police official said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects had armed themselves with baseball bats when police arrived but 
did not resist when they were arrested as onlookers cheered the police. 
</P>
<P>
"The skinheads . . . said they would do anything the white police asked them 
to," Swank said. 
</P>
<P>
The three victims were treated for cuts and bruises by paramedics at the scene 
but refused to be taken to a hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the suspects were carrying cards from several hate groups, 
including the American White Separatist Group based in Glendale and White Power 
based in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
But none is known to be a leader in any local hate groups, said Jerry Shapiro, 
assistant director of the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of groups like this that are basically one-man operations, and 
this (American White Separatist Group) is one of them." He said the group has a 
Garden Grove post office box. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a connection with the old-time hate groups, and we are 
looking into a connection with the National Socialist White People's Party, 
because they put out a paper called White Power," Shapiro said.

MISSION VIEJO REACHES FINAL WITH 6-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mission Viejo High School took advantage of four first-inning errors to score 
four runs Tuesday en route to a 6-2 victory over Ramona in a Southern Section 
3-A softball semifinal at Alicia Park in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Daugherty tripled home one run and scored another in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona (22-8), which finished the game with six errors, cut the Diablo lead to 
4-2, thanks to an error by second baseman Keri McDaniel and a run-scoring 
single by Sarah Parry. But Mission Viejo came back with two more runs in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos (18-8) scored once on four consecutive hits -- capped by Jennifer 
Ward's run-scoring single -- and got their second run of the inning when, with 
the bases still loaded, Ramona first baseman Jennifer Sandoval threw wildly to 
the plate after fielding Renee Pina's squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's Erin Fitzgerald (12-4) gave up eight hits, six coming in the 
first three innings, but she was helped by a number of timely defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to them right away," said Mission Viejo Coach Jeff Cunningham, whose 
team will play Covina, a 7-2 winner over Saugus, in Saturday's 5:30 p.m. 3-A 
championship game at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a little bit tentatively after we scored the four runs, and Erin got 
a little unsettled in the early going. But she settled down after the first few 
innings and pitched a good ballgame," 
</P>
<P>
Said Ramona Coach Angela Melander: "The first inning really killed us. You 
can't make as many errors as we did in an inning and expect to beat a good team 
like Mission Viejo. The errors we made were not typical of the way we have been 
playing all season and it's a shame for us to end the season on this kind of 
note." 
</P>
<P>
While Ramona pitcher Angel Jaramillo (14-6) was being victimized by her team's 
erratic play, Fitzgerald was getting help from her defense. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Ramona's Lisa DeGarmo reached first on first baseman 
Renee Pina's fielding error, but shortstop Ward made a diving stop of Shelli 
Chimelewski's hard grounder and touched second base with her bare hand to force 
DeGarmo. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with runners on first and second and two outs in the inning, Mission 
Viejo center fielder Amy Bond made a diving catch of Rachel Heyse's sinking 
liner.

KENNEDY'S OFFENSE TAKES COMMAND IN 7-2 WIN OVER TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For a team that spent the regular season winning with pitching and defense, the 
Kennedy High School baseball team is starting to make an offensive spectacle of 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have shown some muscle during the Southern Section 3-A 
playoffs, and Tuesday they had 11 hits, three for extra bases, in a 7-2 victory 
over Tustin at UC Irvine. Kennedy plays Saugus Saturday in the championship 
game in Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive game that Kennedy has scored at least six runs. 
All have been playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won with pitching and defense all year," Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal 
said. "We've been hitting the ball a lot better in the playoffs. I guess it's 
good timing." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had a few breaks along the way -- a couple of infield singles, a couple 
of fly balls that were lost in the sun. But the Fighting Irish hit the ball 
with authority. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third inning, Greg Hansell hit a hanging curve off loser 
Dave Baker (7-3) over the 380-foot sign in left field. It was the second home 
run in as many games for Hansell. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a fastball, but he threw a slow curve so I had time to 
adjust," Hansell said. "I don't think I've ever hit a ball farther." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell's solo home run broke a scoreless tie, although Kennedy had threatened 
in each first of three innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish had two hits in the first, including a double by Steve Rath. 
They had a runner on second in the second and runners on first and second in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
"After the third inning, I told my assistant coach that if we could just hold 
on like that, Kennedy was in danger," Tustin Coach Vince Brown said. "The next 
inning, the guy hits the home run and then we made some mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin players twice lost fly balls in the sun in the fourth, which led to two 
runs and a 3-0 Kennedy lead. The Fighting Irish scored a run in the second and 
three in the third, two scoring on a 400-foot triple by Rath that hit the base 
of the fence in center field. 
</P>
<P>
Rath had three hits and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"Kennedy is not really known as a hitting team," Brown said. "but they're hot 
right now. We gave them some baserunners, but they were hitting the ball hard." 
</P>
<P>
Seven runs were more than enough for Pete Montera, who had a shutout through 
six innings. Montera (11-2) wasn't overpowering, but he had good control. He 
struck out five and walked only one. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Gerlach drove in both of Tustin's runs with a bases-loaded single in the 
seventh. But, Montera finished the game by getting Shawn Green to ground into a 
force play. It was 17th complete game in the last 19 for Kennedy pitchers.

NEVIN'S CRASH COURSE CARRIES EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the fundamental laws of baserunning, the Phil Nevin way, is simple: The 
quickest way to score is to run through an opposing catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin, El Dorado High School's talented shortstop, demonstrated a crash course 
on his kind of baserunning Tuesday by scoring the winning run in the eighth 
inning of a 3-2 victory over Lakewood in the semifinals of the Southern Section 
5-A division playoffs at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin scored after a frightening head-on collision with Lakewood catcher Keith 
Tripp. Tripp lay face down near home plate for several minutes after the play 
and lost a front tooth. Nevin was ejected for failing to slide, but the winning 
run was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial play moved El Dorado (22-8) into the championship game 
against Millikan (21-8) -- a 2-0 winner over Hacienda Heights Wilson -- at 7:30 
Saturday night at Dodger Stadium. It also ended four years of frustration for 
Coach Steve Gullotti. El Dorado had been eliminated in the semifinals in three 
of the past four years under Gullotti. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also avenged a 5-4 loss to Lakewood two years ago in the 
semifinals, a loss in which Nevin, a sophomore who moved to shortstop when Bret 
Boone was ejected, committed a crucial error that allowed two runs to score in 
the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way I was stopping at third," Nevin said. "I saw the catcher two 
feet in front of the plate and straddling the line. There was no way to get 
around him, so I figured the quickest way to score was to go right through 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Nevin could have easily been out on the play. Lakewood right fielder Richard 
Lovan made a perfect throw to the plate after fielding a single by Matt Luke, 
and his throw appeared to have Nevin beat by a couple of steps. 
</P>
<P>
But Tripp never completely controlled the throw and when Nevin came crashing 
home, the ball squirted away and El Dorado had the victory. An hour later, the 
principal parties were still debating whether Nevin should have been ruled out 
for failing to slide. 
</P>
<P>
"If the catcher has possession of ball, then he can block the plate," Gullotti 
said. "He never had complete possession for a full second, and the contact 
wasn't malicious, so the run counts." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, opposing Coach Walter (Spud) O'Neil of Lakewood had a different 
view. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our catcher had visible control of the ball and did a good job 
blocking the plate," O'Neil said. "He's got a tooth missing, so you know Nevin 
didn't slide. Nevin was ejected for not sliding, so he should have been called 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Clark, Southern Section administrator, said the play would stand since 
there is no avenue for protesting the playing rules in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (27-4) managed only five hits off Luke and reliever Pete Janicki 
(7-1). But the Lancers appeared to be headed to the finals when they broke a 
1-1 tie with an unearned run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Hardy singled home Tripp with the go-ahead run after Tripp had reached 
third on a stolen base. Tripp was out by 20 feet on the play, but El Dorado 
third baseman Crosby Spencer dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Gullotti, who has been snake-bitten in past playoffs, was asked if he was 
sensing another heartbreaking loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous," he said. "I have not allowed myself to get emotionally 
involved in the playoffs this year." 
</P>
<P>
But El Dorado didn't disappoint this time. Right fielder Greg Fife led off the 
bottom of the seventh with a towering triple to right-center and scored on 
Spencer's sacrifice fly to tie the game, 2-2.

SOUTHERN SECTION 3-A TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY HILLS MAY NEED MORE THAN GOOD PLAN TO BEAT WOODBRIDGE 
</P>

<P>
After advancing to the Southern Section 3-A championship tennis match, Sunny 
Hills High School tennis Coach Steve White summed up the mood of the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great, this has been our dream for four years," White said after Sunny 
Hills defeated Laguna Beach, 10-8, last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One last step remains before the Lancers can cap their season, however. Sunny 
Hills faces Woodbridge in the 3-A final at 3:15 p.m. today at the Sunny Hills 
Racquet Club in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Sunny Hills has a 22-1 record. The Lancers' only loss was to 
Newport Harbor. Top-seeded Woodbridge is 19-4. 
</P>
<P>
White had to plan -- and the players had to perform -- a masterpiece of 
strategy to defeat Laguna Beach, which boasted one of the top singles lineups 
in the Southern Section but a doubles lineup that was less imposing. In high 
school tennis, a player can play in either singles or doubles competition 
during a match, but not both. Against Laguna Beach, the Lancers threw their 
strength into doubles. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, the Lancers face a more solid all-around team. Woodbridge is 
as strong in singles as it is in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Ivey, the Warriors' No. 1 player, looks like a linebacker, but seems to 
get to almost every shot and hits winner after winner. You can't tell by his 
expression whether he's winning or losing. Usually, he's winning. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey advanced to the semifinals of the Southern Section singles tournament on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Steinhardt plays at No. 2 singles and Chris Emery plays at No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wang and Eric Berg team to play at No. 1 doubles. Rajan Saggar and Brett 
Isaacman are the No. 2 doubles team and Victor Ro and Darren Isaacman are No. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills has a flexible lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Henderson, a four-year varsity player, is at No. 1 singles. Hans 
Erkelens, a foreign-exchange student from Holland, usually plays at No. 2 
singles, but played No. 3 doubles against Laguna Beach. Ryan Henderson, Glenn's 
younger brother, is at No. 3 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Duncan and Jason Klingsberg are the Lancers' No. 1 doubles team. 
Klingsberg is also an All-Southern Section water polo player. 
</P>
<P>
James Choi and Brad Bosari are the No. 2 doubles team and Sameer Gavanker and 
Nathan Winn are at No. 3.

Local banks and savings and loans, long in need of capital, are under more 
pressure than ever before to raise their levels of capital -- the basic fund 
that protects them from unforeseen losses. 
</P>
<P>
New regulations coming out of Washington are requiring banks and S&amp;Ls to 
bolster their capital base, and those regulations are forcing the traditionally 
lower-capitalized S&amp;Ls to come up with hard-to-get dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest place to get that cash for some institutions is to cut out 
dividends, and two major S&amp;Ls in Orange County have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
The latest, the parent of FarWest Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach, said 
recently that it was terminating its quarterly 10-cent-per-share dividend "for 
the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach had stopped making 
its quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the stronger S&amp;Ls, as well as most banks, which typically have 
twice as much capital as thrifts, are continuing to pay cash dividends. 
</P>
<P>
One parent of a local bank, Eldorado Bancorp in Laguna Hills, said it was 
increasing its quarterly cash dividend by a penny, to 7 cents a share. In 
August, Eldorado raised the dividend to 6 cents from a nickel a share. The 
company, which operates eight Eldorado Bank branches in Orange, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties, said the increases reflect the company's strong 
earnings and its effort to return about 20% of those earnings to shareholders.

One local banking company revived by a cash infusion 18 months ago is 
transforming itself into a privately held corporation to eliminate the costs 
associated with maintaining a public company. 
</P>
<P>
John Wertin, who owns 91% of San Clemente Bancorp, plans to pick up the rest of 
the shares in an offering that would give remaining shareholders $1.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Wertin picked up 81% of the company for $1 a share, or $1.5 million, in late 
1987, just as the company was stemming its losses at its Bank of San Clemente 
subsidiary. He picked up an additional 10% by assuming about $700,000 in debt 
to previous directors, who had tried to bail the firm out with personal loans 
to the company. Wertin converted the debt to equity by taking the additional 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The company continued to struggle in the first half of 1988 but ended the year 
with net income of $156,000. In the first quarter this year, the company posted 
net income of $153,000 and had assets of $42.4 million at the end of March, 
according to Michael Dunahee, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
Wertin, the company's chairman, also is president of Pacific Co.

AMERICAN CONTINENTAL GIVES UP ITS FIGHT TO KEEP BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS

American Continental Corp., the parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, 
has given up its fight to keep its bankruptcy lawyers. Federal regulators have 
been trying to disqualify the two firms on grounds of conflict of interest 
because they represent the same regulatory bodies in cases involving other 
troubled S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
In their place, Phoenix-based American Continental has hired the Los Angeles 
firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert. 
</P>
<P>
That is the same firm that American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. 
turned to earlier this month when he retained Howard L. Weitzman to protect the 
company's interests in ongoing criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental, Arizona's fourth largest company, filed a U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court petition on April 13 to reorganize its debts under Chapter 11 of the 
bankruptcy laws. The next day, regulators seized Lincoln Savings, alleging that 
it was being operated in an unsafe manner. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's original bankruptcy lawyers, the Houston firm of 
Sheinfeld, Maley &amp; Kay and the Phoenix firm of Bues, Gilbert, Wake &amp; 
Morrill, were being challenged by regulators, who oppose the bankruptcy, 
because the same firms represented regulators in litigation involving other 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious we were going to fight this issue over and over again," said 
Mark M. Connally, an American Continental spokesman. So the company decided to 
bring in a new law firm. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Feder, head of Wyman Bautzer's bankruptcy department, will oversee the 
bankruptcy case, while Weitzman will handle civil litigation.

COLLECTION POLICY IN VETERAN LOAN DEFAULTS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Department of Veterans Affairs spends millions of dollars each year trying 
to collect some of the $2 billion owed by veterans who have lost their homes 
through foreclosures, but retrieves only a fraction of the amount, according to 
the General Accounting Office and veterans organizations. 
</P>
<P>
GAO investigators found that the department's emphasis on foreclosing after a 
veteran defaults on a mortgage, and then trying to get cash from the veteran, 
is a "flawed" policy that has resulted in collection of only about 14% of the 
total debt, said Ed Kratzer, the GAO's deputy assistant director for housing. 
The GAO, which is the investigative agency of Congress, is working on two 
reports about loan policies and practices at the veterans department. 
</P>
<P>
Several years of high foreclosure rates, especially in the Southwest and West, 
have seriously depleted the fund used to guarantee veterans' mortgages, forcing 
Congress to appropriate $1.7 billion since 1984 to keep the program afloat. 
</P>
<P>
More than 13 million military families and individuals have bought homes over 
the last 45 years with the help of the loan guaranty revolving fund. The fund 
is used to pay lenders when veterans default on their mortgages. Under the 
present system, the government guarantees mortgages for up to 50% of a loan of 
$45,000 or less. If a loan is higher than $45,000, the department guarantees 
40% of the total or $36,000, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
While spending money and effort to collect the debt, the veterans department 
frequently ignores other ways of handling a default that would be less costly 
to veterans and to the government, Kratzer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreclosure is usually the most expensive" way to handle a loan default and it 
is a "messy, expensive" process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After a foreclosure, the department sells the house. If the proceeds of the 
sale are less than the amount owed on the mortgage, the department tries to 
collect the difference from the veteran. Few veterans, who presumably would not 
have defaulted in the first place if they had had enough money, have sufficient 
funds to pay this extra amount, veterans' groups said. 
</P>
<P>
One GAO report nearing completion is expected to "point out alternatives to 
foreclosure that (the veterans department) ought to be considering," Kratzer 
said. "There is a lot of money to be saved on both sides," by veterans and the 
government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The department could, for example, ask a veteran to deed his home voluntarily 
to the government, saving the cost of a foreclosure, or the agency could pay 
off the loan and become, in effect, the veteran's banker. If the government 
takes over the loan, it usually restructures it and may lower the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over a loan is the best solution because it keeps veterans in their 
homes, according to Charles M. Novak, management analyst with the GAO's Seattle 
regional office. "There's only about a 50% success rate (with this tactic), but 
even if it only works half the time, it's still beneficial" for the veterans 
department because it saves foreclosure costs on half the houses the department 
takes over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The third alternative to foreclosure is called a compromise sale, in which the 
veteran is allowed to sell his home when he can no longer make payments. If the 
proceeds of the sale are not enough to cover the amount due, the government 
advances the money needed to make up the difference and asks the veteran to 
sign a promissory note to pay all or part of the amount. 
</P>
<P>
Novak, who studied veterans department foreclosures in several regions of the 
country, said the government chose an alternative to foreclosure in only a 
small number of mortgage-default cases. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, for instance, he said it costs the government about $11,000 in 
interest, maintenance, tax and other expenses to hold a house for a year after 
foreclosure. The veterans department collects an average of $3,000 from the 
veterans after foreclosure, meaning that the government "is spending $11,000 to 
collect $3,000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the Bush Administration have sharply different views of what to do 
about the troubled veterans' loan fund. 
</P>
<P>
A bill approved recently by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs would 
indemnify veterans, barring the government, in all but a few cases, from trying 
to collect from those who have lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would abolish the current loan guaranty fund and replace it 
with a mortgage insurance program for veterans. 
</P>
<P>
To help support the fund, veterans would pay a fee of 1.5% of the total loan 
amount or three-fourths of 1% if the veteran makes a down payment of 5% or 
more. The government would pay one-fourth of 1% of the loan amount each year 
for three years to help fund the insurance program. Disabled veterans and 
widows of veterans who died from service-connected causes would not have to pay 
the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans currently pay 1% of their mortgage amounts into the revolving loan 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office said that income from fees and proceeds from 
loan sales would enable the new insurance fund to build up a reserve that could 
be invested in U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating veterans' obligations to repay the government after a foreclosure 
would have little impact on the new mortgage fund because the veterans 
department collects so little of the debt, the budget office said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, however, believes that the proposed fund would show 
deficits beginning in 1994 that would continue indefinitely, said R.J. Vogel, 
chief benefits director for the veterans department.

AN INDEPENDENT FILM MAKER TAKES A STAB AT THE TV GAME

John Sayles, the staunchly independent film maker, would not seem the most 
likely person to jump into the network series grind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of my program," he said. "I've told myself I'd do anything once." 
</P>
<P>
"Shannon's Deal" isn't on NBC's fall schedule, but the two-hour pilot airs 
Sunday. Besides Sayles, it boasts such behind-the-camera talent as "Jewel of 
the Nile" director Lewis Teague, who also directed Sayles' early feature 
effort, "Alligator," a cult-favorite horror film; "Fame" producer Stan Rogow, 
and composer Wynton Marsalis, who wrote the score. 
</P>
<P>
Sayles, who has avoided big movie studios throughout a film career that 
includes "The Return of the Secaucus Seven," "Brother From Another Planet" and 
most recently "Eight Men Out," got involved with the NBC project after Rogow 
asked if he would be interested in writing a TV movie that could become a 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I would if it was something I would be interested in and maybe write 
one or two episodes and tell whoever was taking it over, so long. Kind of 
establish the character and see if they could run with it," Sayles said. 
</P>

Sayles was no stranger to television, having written the TV movies "Perfect 
Match" and "Unnatural Causes." "I actually had a pretty good experience on both 
of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He came up with several series premises, and NBC Entertainment President 
Brandon Tartikoff picked "Shannon's Deal." 
</P>
<P>
In "Shannon's Deal," set in Philadelphia, Jamey Sheridan plays Jack Shannon, a 
former corporate lawyer whose gambling addiction cost him his family and 
career. As the movie opens, he's trying to start over as a general-practice, 
anything-that-comes-in-the-door attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Sayles made him a former poker sharp so he could use the skills of bluffing and 
holding in his dealings with prosecutors, other attorneys and witnesses. He 
also liked the idea of having him confronted daily with the life he gave up.

A Friday story about a meeting of crime victims incorrectly identified Superior 
Court Judge Bernard Revak as being chastised for releasing a 17-year-old 
convicted of second-degree murder so the teen-ager could attend the birth of 
his child and be with his family. Actually, Revak had no connection with the 
case. The judge who released the youth was Juvenile Court Judge Sheridan Reed.

The Burbank City Council, which for years has been unsuccessfully pressuring 
the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to hold its meetings at night 
so the public can more easily attend, now wants the meetings broadcast on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Tuesday to ask the airport commission to allow the taping of 
its Monday morning meetings for broadcast during evening hours. The tape delay 
would allow residents who cannot attend the meetings to become involved with 
airport issues, said Commissioner Mary Lou Howard, who represents Burbank on 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Council members and Burbank commissioners have repeatedly complained that it is 
inconvenient for the public to attend the authority meetings held at 9 a.m. on 
the first and third Mondays of each month. 
</P>
<P>
The authority last week rejected a proposal by Burbank commissioners to have 
night meetings. It was the third time in four years that the authority has 
turned down such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Composed of three representatives each from Glendale, Pasadena and Burbank, the 
authority oversees operation of Burbank Airport.

Elvis Presley's daughter gave birth to the late king of rock 'n' roll's 
grandchild -- a 7-pound, 2-ounce girl -- at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica 
on Monday, a spokesman for the couple said today. 
</P>
<P>
With musician-husband Danny Keough at her side, Lisa Marie Presley delivered 
the girl by natural childbirth at 8 a.m. Monday, said publicist Paul Bloch. The 
child hasn't been named, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both mother and child are in excellent health," Bloch said, adding that 
actress Priscilla Beaulieu Presley, now a grandmother, is thrilled. "Everyone 
is very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Presley, 21, married Keough, 23, last Oct. 3 during a small, private 
service at the huge Hollywood headquarters of the Church of Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
Elvis died in his Memphis home in 1977 of a heart attack and apparent drug 
overdose. Lisa is due to inherit his estate, estimated at over $50 million, 
when she is 30.

JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER UNO TO SUCCEED TAKESHITA

<P>
Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno agreed today to become Japan's next prime minister, 
at the behest of a governing party crippled by scandal and divided by the 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats turned to Uno, 66, after elder statesman Masayoshi Ito 
refused the job. 
</P>
<P>
Uno was attending a meeting in Paris and agreed by telephone, apparently with 
some reluctance, to become head of the party and to replace Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy secretary-general of the party, appeared at a news 
conference and quoted Uno as saying: "I am not confident I can handle the job 
when the party is facing such a difficult time, but now that the party is in an 
unprecedented crisis I will commit myself for the party." 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said party leaders decided Uno was "currently the most-suited 
candidate as successor" to Takeshita. The prime minister is resigning to take 
responsibility for the Recruit influence-buying scandal, which stained the top 
ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition within the party indicated Uno may have a difficult time even if he 
gets the expected approval from Parliament, where the Liberal Democrats have a 
large majority. 
</P>
<P>
Some oppose the foreign minister because he is a senior member of the party 
faction of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, during whose tenure in 
1982-87 the scandal developed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am outraged by this nonsense of giving the country's highest office, which 
only one person can assume, to a sort of managing director of the Nakasone 
company," former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda told reporters. "I am totally 
amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Fukuda, 84, had lobbied against Uno. His own name was one of many mentioned as 
possible candidates during the long search. 
</P>
<P>
Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest 
opposition group, said: "The Recruit scandal involved corruption during 
Yasuhiro Nakasone's administration. It is . . . a violent act to appoint one of 
Nakasone's aides as the next prime minister."

President Bush today granted a one-year extension of trade benefits to China 
and Hungary, based on their performance on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
In a notice to Congress, Bush said he is keeping the two countries on the list 
of nations that enjoy the "most favored nation" trading status. 
</P>
<P>
The designation protects these nations from higher tariffs that the United 
States imposes on countries it deems to have poor records on human rights and 
emigration. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, for example, does not have preferred trade status, but Bush 
has offered to grant that designation if Moscow formalizes its relaxed 
emigration policy.

Romania was isolated and denounced today as Europe's most repressive state. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers at a 35-nation conference on human rights singled out the 
government of President Nicolae Ceausescu as the odd man out in a changing 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"While strong currents of change are felt throughout Europe, there is one 
government -- Romania -- which apparently has decided to go against the tide," 
Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Hans van den Broek said. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's sweeping plans to modernize Romania include the destruction of 
thousands of villages of the ethnic Hungarian minority. 
</P>
<P>
None of Romania's East Bloc allies at the conference came to Ceausescu's 
defense at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.

The social board in the suburb of Kista dropped plans to participate in the

Social Commissioner Ragnar Gotestam later announced on TV that the project had

other Caribbean islands. He said he hoped to pursue the project later.

FACTORY ORDERS POST INCREASE OF 2.7% IN APRIL

<P>
Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods rose 2.7% in April, the best 
showing in four months, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable goods climbed 
to a seasonally adjusted $239.4 billion last month after rising 0.7% in March 
and dropping during the first two months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
April's increase reflected higher demand in a variety of industry categories, 
and would have been even stronger were it not for a 15.8% drop in defense 
orders, which are subject to wide swings depending on when big contracts are 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding defense, all other orders were up 3.6% in April after falling 0.3% in 
March and 2.7% in February. 
</P>
<P>
April's upturn in factory orders was in line with other recent reports on the 
economy's performance which analysts say suggest that while growth is slowing, 
a recession is not imminent. 
</P>
<P>
It was the strongest gain since a 4.7% increase in orders last December. 
</P>
<P>
In the volatile transportation category, orders rose 1.4% in April after 
jumping 11% in March and falling 7.6% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, all other orders were up 3% last month after falling 
during the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-defense capital goods, meanwhile, posted a strong 6.1% gain in 
April after rising 2.5% in March. That category is considered a good barometer 
of business investment plans.

U.S. URGES JAPAN, GERMANY TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady today urged West Germany and Japan to 
reduce trade surpluses at the start of a two-day economic conference dominated 
by friction over U.S. trade policy toward Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The industrial countries have agreed that reducing the large existing trade 
and current account imbalances is a matter of priority," Brady told the 
conference of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's trade surplus declined modestly last year but has increased for three 
consecutive quarters," Brady said. "Germany's trade surplus continues to grow, 
and contributes importantly to the major imbalances that have developed within 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The OECD ministerial-level meeting opened amid Japanese lobbying for a censure 
of U.S. trade policy after the Bush Administration's decision to cite Japan as 
a nation with trade barriers harmful to American companies. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which also cited Brazil and India as trade offenders, said 
the decision to cite Japan was made because of its refusal to buy U.S.-made 
satellites and its barriers on U.S. lumber products. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, the only OECD member nation on the list, would like the OECD to 
criticize the "unilateral trade action" in its final communique after the 
conference ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills defended the Bush Administration 
decision on the eve of the OECD meeting, saying its goal is to "open and expand 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
Brady said the Bush Administration is "fully committed" to reducing the U.S. 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"But many in the United States feel we are being urged to act in a vacuum," he 
said. "U.S. policy alone does not drive international economic developments, 
and international policy prescriptions for current problems cannot end with 
U.S. fiscal action." 
</P>
<P>
"Sustaining growth and reducing external imbalances also requires that steps be 
taken by the surplus countries," Brady said. "Action by Germany and Japan is 
particularly important." 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury secretary also expressed concern over the rise of the dollar 
against other major currencies, saying it could hamper cooperative efforts 
toward adjustment by members of the Group of Seven top industrialized 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
"If the dollar's recent rise is sustained for a prolonged period, or extended, 
it could undermine our adjustment efforts," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The OECD, made up of 24 non-communist nations, was formed to coordinate 
policies that promote economic and social welfare and assist developing 
countries.

The government's chief economic forecasting gauge shot up 0.8% in April as it 
reversed course after posting declines in the previous two months, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
The upward turn in the index of leading economic indicators allowed the index 
to steer clear of the traditional signal of a forthcoming recession -- three 
declines in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the 
future, had dropped a revised 0.6% in March and 0.3% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated, was consistent 
with the view that while the economy is slowing, there still is enough strength 
left to power the record peacetime expansion through its seventh year.

"It wasn't a good bet, it isn't a good bet and it's not going to be a good bet 
in the fall that a recession is about to occur," economist James Annable of 
First National Bank of Chicago said in anticipation of today's report. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase in the index was the biggest rise since a similar 0.8% 
jump in January. 
</P>
<P>
Using the three-month rule of thumb for predicting recessions, the index has 
correctly forecast all eight economic downturns that have occurred since 1948, 
but it also has flashed false recession signals on five other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the index declined five times in a row in the months surrounding 
the October, 1987, stock market crash, from which the economy emerged 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
In April, eight of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up the 
composite index pointed upward, led by an increase in manufacturers' orders for 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Other indicators making positive contributions were rising building permits; a 
longer average workweek; higher stock prices; a decrease in initial claims for 
jobless benefits; slower vendor deliveries, signaling stronger demand; a gain 
in orders for new plants and equipment, and an increase in manufacturers' 
unfilled orders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Indicators Drop 
</P>
<P>
Three indicators pointed downward: a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence; a contraction in the money supply, and falling prices for sensitive 
materials, indicating slower demand. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 145.7% of its 1982 base of 100. The index 
has advanced 1.3% over the last six months, contrasted with a 1.7% increase 
over the previous six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Annable said recent reports on the economy's performance indicate that growth 
will slow to a more sustainable level and "suggest this economy is in better 
shape for growth than even we optimists thought." 
</P>
<P>
Pessimists are also rethinking their views. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, has been 
forecasting a mild recession by year's end but now concedes, "The odds are by 
no means convincing, even to me. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is coming on the side of a soft landing -- continued but subdued 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
That is just what the Federal Reserve has been trying to produce by nudging up 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Dederick said an upturn in the index "doesn't mean that we should be looking 
for the economy to go roaring off, but it does weaken the case that the 
slowdown is going to develop into recession proportions."

Patrick Ewing, who led the New York Knicks to their first Atlantic Division 
title in almost two decades, underwent an arthroscopic procedure on his right 
knee today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Norman Scott, who operated on the knee five years ago, said no new damage 
was found and the 7-foot center will be ready for next season. He said the 
procedure was similar to the one performed on point guard Mark Jackson that 
sidelined him for just three weeks during the season. Scott said that in 
addition to examining the knee, he removed some loose articular cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we had operated on the knee five years ago, we wanted to look at it 
again," Scott said. "A full and complete recovery is expected."

Samuel Tshabalala became the first black to win the country's most prestigious 
distance race, the Comrades Marathon, when he covered the 55.5 miles in 5 
hours, 35 minutes, 51 seconds today. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks took six of the top 10 positions in the 64th running of the 
ultra-marathon, which is more than twice as long as the standard marathon of 
26.2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala, 32, topped second-place finisher Willie Mtolo by 4:06. Frenchman 
Jean-Marc Bellocq was third in 5:42:28. 
</P>
<P>
The top woman finisher, Frith van der Merwe, placed 15th overall in 5:54:43. 
</P>
<P>
A record field of more than 13,000 entered the race, which began in the 
southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg and finished in the Indian Ocean city of 
Durban. 
</P>
<P>
Distance running, like almost all sports in South Africa, has been integrated 
at the top levels in recent years. Blacks were first allowed to compete in the 
Comrades Marathon in 1975.

U. OF MARYLAND CONSIDERS EX-LAKER COACH WESTHEAD

Ex-Lakers Coach Paul Westhead of Loyola Marymount College is the latest 
addition to a list of basketball coaching candidates under consideration for 
the opening at the University of Maryland, sources familiar with the search 
process said. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is not known whether Westhead was on the original list of candidates 
given to the search committee, sources said he has since received a number of 
strong recommendations, including one from University of North Carolina Coach 
Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead, 50, said Tuesday from Los Angeles that he had not been contacted by 
anyone about the job, but he said he would be interested in talking with 
Maryland Athletic Director Lew Perkins if he is called. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be interested to see what was going on," Westhead said. "Beyond that, I 
won't make any decisions (about interviewing) until I see how serious the 
university was." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a possible recommendation from Smith, Westhead said that he had not 
heard of one but added that the two have been friends since his years at 
LaSalle during the 1970s. Smith was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving LaSalle, where he had been a head coach for nine years, Westhead 
became a Lakers assistant and took over for ailing Jack McKinney early in the 
1979-80 season and coached the team to an NBA championship. Westhead was fired 
a little more than a year later after a difference in philosophy with Lakers 
star Magic Johnson.

Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, the league's second-leading scorer this year, 
was the lone unanimous choice on a 1989 All-NBA team that included perennial 
choices Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, the league announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the starting five are center Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets 
and forward Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
While Malone was the only player cited on all 85 ballots, Chicago's Jordan and 
Los Angeles' Johnson were both named on all but one. Malone, the MVP at this 
year's All-Star Game, was a second-teamer last year. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the seventh straight All-NBA selection for Johnson and the third 
straight for Jordan. Olajuwon was also picked for the third consecutive year, 
while Barkley has been honored two years running. 
</P>
<P>
Missing from the team for the first time this decade was Larry Bird of the 
Boston Celtics, who played only six games this year due to ankle problems. 
</P>
<P>
Named to the second team were forwards Tom Chambers of Phoenix and Chris Mullin 
of Golden State; guards John Stockton of Utah and Kevin Johnson of Phoenix, and 
center Patrick Ewing of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Voting is done by a national panel of 85 media members.

WEBSTER SETS GOAL: STANLEY CUP

Tom Webster, introduced today as coach of the Kings, said he has always been 
goal-oriented and his immediate goal will be to bring the Stanley Cup to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"With the tremendous success of the team last season, I know my job is to bring 
the Stanley Cup here," Webster said at a news conference at the Forum. "We will 
make every effort to realize that dream." 
</P>
<P>
Webster, 40, former head coach of the New York Rangers, said he was looking 
forward to coaching Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"Gordie Howe was and still is my idol," Webster said. "He was a class 
individual and Wayne Gretzky is a class individual. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne has shown he doesn't like to take a day off; he's always doing his best 
all the time to promote this organization." 
</P>
<P>
Kings owner Bruce McNall said talking to people around the league convinced him 
that Webster was the man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone gave him extraordinarily high marks," McNall related. "Usually you 
will hear at least some negatives." 
</P>
<P>
Webster succeeds Robbie Ftorek as coach of the Kings. (Story, Part III, Page
