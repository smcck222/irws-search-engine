A CHILL FALLS ON 'REDWOOD SUMMER'; 
</P>
<P>
LUMBER COMPANIES STEP UP THEIR OVERCUTTING AS BOMBING VICTIMS FACE CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecuting attorneys look at Earth First! activists the way Nero looked at 
Christians. They flick through the late Edward Abbey's "Monkey Wrench Gang" for 
examples of eco-sabotage, pull together a few news clips on tree-spiking and 
get ready to throw the book. 
</P>
<P>
So when Earth First! activists Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were almost killed 
by a bomb that exploded in their car as they drove through Oakland last 
Thursday, they were promptly arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, Bari had told a rally outside the Mendocino County courthouse 
that she had received more than 45 death threats. After the first 10, Bari 
half-joked, you get used to them. Now, badly mangled and hospitalized, she's 
facing charges of transporting the explosives that blew up under her driver's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, in daylight and in the middle of the town of Philo, a logging 
truck rammed Bari's car from behind. By a miracle, the three adults and four 
children in the car were not hurt. The district attorney said there was 
insufficient evidence to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
Things are tense in Mendocino and Humboldt counties. The rally outside the 
courthouse was the launch for Bari's brainchild, Mississippi Summer in the 
Redwoods, shortened for convenience to Redwood Summer. Its aim is to generate a 
surge of nonviolent civil disobedience akin to that of the Mississippi civil 
rights campaigns of a generation ago. The target is the timber companies, 
primarily the giant corporations Georgia Pacific and Louisiana Pacific, which 
have been overcutting for years and plan to accelerate this practice in the 
months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Redwood Summer's opening event June 20 will be an effort to shut down Louisiana 
Pacific's log export dock in Samoa, a little port town just south of Eureka in 
Humboldt County. Here, Louisiana Pacific ships out logs sawed in half, thus 
qualifying them as "partly finished products" that evade the ban on the export 
of raw logs taken from public lands. The demonstrators will also draw attention 
to the fact that Louisiana Pacific is setting up a large mill in Mexico to 
process its logs -- resulting in the loss of hundreds of local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The overcutting is indisputable. The timber companies' own statistics, 
buttressed by UC Extension analyses, show an overcut of 225% on both private 
and public lands. The companies know well that public opinion has turned 
against them. Hence the panicky clear-cutting scheduled for this summer; hence, 
too, the slanders against Bari and the Mendocino Earth Firsters as 
eco-terrorists driving spikes into trees to interfere with cutting machinery, 
heedless of possible injuries to loggers and mill workers. 
</P>
<P>
But Bari has spoken out against spiking. There has been just one confirmed 
spiking in Mendocino County, in 1986, injuring one millworker. It was 
reportedly traced to a man from Los Angeles camping next to a timber site. The 
Mendocino County district attorney declined to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Louisiana Pacific, notorious for union-busting, has been repeatedly 
fined by federal and state oversight bodies for failing to protect its workers 
from occupational hazards. Fortunato Reyes, a Mexican worker in Louisiana 
Pacific's Ukiah mill, was crushed to death last year when his supervisor 
ordered him to clear "the green chain," a part of the lumber assembly line, 
while it was running. 
</P>
<P>
The timber companies foster the idea that environmentalists are a bunch of 
middle-class people in Volvos, heedless of the fate of loggers and millworkers. 
But timber workers are well aware of the truth of overcutting. Bari and others 
have called for "sustainable yield practices," meaning trees are not cut beyond 
the ability of the forest to regenerate. Otherwise, the jobs disappear when the 
trees are gone. This position is far from radical; it's supported by a growing 
percentage of timber workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bari strove to build coalitions with these workers, and that kind of politics 
made her dangerous enemies. No one familiar with Bari, Cherney and the Earth 
First! group in Mendocino County believes for a second that the two were 
wittingly carrying a bomb in their car. Fake Earth First! leaflets with threats 
to set the woods on fire and to attack loggers have been circulated through the 
mills. Demonstrators against overcutting have been physically attacked. Not a 
single elected official in Mendocino County has denounced the many threats 
against Bari. 
</P>
<P>
So the murder plan against Bari and Cherney failed, but the victims are being 
blamed. Redwood Summer is off to an ominous start.

COMPUTER FILE: PUBLISHING WITH MEAGER RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Desktop publishing is a notorious resource hog. The leading programs for IBM PC 
compatibles and Macintoshes need fast computers, lots of memory and disk 
storage and top-end laser printers to produce superb documents. 
</P>
<P>
A new entrant in the field, Avagio Publishing System, $300, from Unison World 
of Alameda, Calif., distinguishes itself by generating remarkably high quality 
with modest -- even meager -- resources. 
</P>
<P>
It runs fine on IBM compatibles as old-fashioned as an XT equipped with a small 
hard disk and low-resolution CGA graphics. It prints beautifully on a 
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet and even acceptably on a nine-pin dot matrix printer. 
</P>
<P>
It comes with its own set of fonts, which can be scaled to any size between six 
and 500 points. That's a range from 1/12th inch to nearly 7 inches high, two to 
four times what you get from programs costing twice as much or more, such as 
PageMaker and Xerox Ventura Publisher. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing smooth-edged characters, the scalable fonts take 
little storage room on your hard disk. Contrast that with the "downloadable" 
fonts that are typical of other programs. They must be created and stored as 
font libraries, gobbling up many megabytes of disk space if you want a full 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Avagio also comes with a library of 150 graphic images with which to dress up 
publications. (They do take up a lot of space, about 2.2 megabytes of storage.) 
</P>
<P>
The heart of a document usually is the text. With Avagio there are two ways to 
enter text. You can type it in, as you would with a word processing program. Or 
you can import it. 
</P>
<P>
It is handy to be able to type in the words, but it isn't much fun. There is a 
noticeable lag between the time you hit the keys and when your words appear on 
screen. (It might be better on a fast machine; I used Avagio on a mediocre 
8-megahertz AT clone with an 80286 microprocessor.) Importing text is the best 
way to go and easy to do. If you use WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, MultiMate or 
WordStar, Avagio will maintain most of your formatting choices when it flows 
the text onto the page. Of course, any standard text file, which virtually 
every word processing program can create, can be imported. But you'll have to 
do all of the formatting in Avagio when you do so. 
</P>
<P>
Text flows into "frames" that you place on the page when you do the layout. You 
have complete control over the number of columns on the page -- they can be of 
unequal widths -- as well as how text will flow from one column to another. 
</P>
<P>
You can set up frames that size themselves automatically to fit the amount of 
text. Automatic flow of text from one page to another is an option. 
</P>
<P>
Hyphenation can be applied to columns of text in two ways. One does it 
automatically, based on an algorithm rather than a dictionary. I found a flaw 
that the publisher said will be corrected in the next version. It was easy to 
fix the improperly broken text that resulted, however. Manual hyphenation is 
also available, but tedious. As long as the columns aren't too narrow, pages 
are fine without hyphens. 
</P>
<P>
A set of graphics tools allows you to draw boxes, circles and horizontal, 
vertical and diagonal lines. It is possible to create a range of interesting 
designs. Add some type and you've got a logo. 
</P>
<P>
The program includes only four typefaces, imitations of the classic Times 
Roman, Helvetica, Century and Bodoni. But considering the huge range over which 
they can be sized and the ability to set bold face, italics, oblique, condensed 
and expanded type, you have everything you need to make elegant layouts. In 
fact, the absence of additional typefaces will keep pages from becoming garish. 
However, a utility program allows soft fonts for Hewlett-Packard laser printers 
to be converted for use with Avagio. 
</P>
<P>
To make it easy to repeat document designs, Avagio uses master pages and style 
sheets. Master pages can contain repeating elements, such as page numbers in a 
header or footer or a company logo. Style sheets store specifications for the 
layout and typography of each kind of text element that you will use, such as 
for headlines and subheads. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful graphics feature is called "mingle." It allows you to place one 
image on top of another (text too) and determine which dominates. You do it by 
defining whether the black or white portions of the image will be black, white, 
clear or reversed when mingled with another image. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, Avagio is a remarkably complete desktop publishing package that 
comes ready to run on nearly any PC. 
</P>
<P>

JACK SMITH: BREACHING THE STEEP FACADE TO HIS LOT IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the road to the Dead Sea via the desolate Jordan Valley, we stopped to visit 
Masada. It is what we might call a mesa -- a massive mountain with a flat top 
and steep sides. The Jews consider it a shrine and a symbol of their resolution 
to be free. 
</P>
<P>
It was to Masada that a group of zealous Jews fled to escape the Roman 
conquerors. In 40 BC, Herod the Great, a Roman tool, had built a sumptuous 
palace and mighty fortress on the rock to protect himself from the Jews. In AD 
70, when the Romans crushed Jerusalem, fewer than 1,000 Jews overcame the Roman 
garrison and refortified their stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
But the Romans sent their best legion, with thousands of slaves to carry water 
and provisions, and laid siege. For months the Jews held out. Finally the 
Romans built a ramp to the top, used a battering ram to breach the wall, then 
surged in, only to find the beleaguered Jews all dead by their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
According to the historian Josephus, the Jewish leader had made a dramatic 
speech urging death before slavery and dishonor. Then each man killed his wife 
and children. Lots were cast for 10 men who would kill the others. Lots were 
drawn again for the one man who would kill the other nine. Then he fell on his 
own sword. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how Josephus knew all this -- especially the text of the Jewish 
leader's heroic speech. But in the Holy Land the facts are so entwined with 
mythology and "tradition" that it is pointless to question them. 
</P>
<P>
We took an aerial car up the mountain's steep facade and then walked 97 steps 
to the top. Many ruins of the old fortress remain; also many ruins of Herod's 
palace. Herod was a great builder. He left his mark all over the land. But like 
many other men history calls great, he was a megalomaniac and a monster. He 
murdered, among others, his wife, her two sons, her brother, her grandfather 
and her mother, and his first-born son. Of course we know him as the man who 
ordered the slaying of the infants of Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot see Masada, in its stark isolation, without wondering at the 
courage, energy and heroism of the Jews who fortified it, and died rather than 
surrender to rape and slavery. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along that desolate road our guide told us that we were passing the 
location of Lot's wife, who had been turned to a pillar of salt. No pillar 
remains. Undoubtedly time has eroded it. 
</P>
<P>
That evening we stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Jerusalem. In memory, one hotel 
seems indistinguishable from another, but I must say they were all first class, 
which helped to ease the hardship. 
</P>
<P>
The next day we were to see the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the holiest of 
cities -- a shrine for Muslim, Christian and Jew alike. It is the place, of 
course, where Jesus died on the cross, and even an unbeliever must be moved by 
the sense of his presence. As Pilate said, "Ecce homo." Behold the man. 
</P>
<P>
I will not try to describe Jerusalem. We saw too much in too little time. It is 
curious that as we took off our shoes to enter the Dome of the Rock, a group of 
Israeli soldiers, men and women, sat nearby, taking off their shoes. This 
mosque, with its Byzantine design and dazzling mosaics, its Oriental interior 
and richly colored stained glass, is surmounted by a great gold dome which 
stands over an enormous white rock. It is said that it was on this rock that 
Abraham offered to sacrifice his son Isaac to God, and that it was the rock 
from which Mohammed ascended to heaven on his horse. 
</P>
<P>
As we left, a jet boom crashed over the Holy City, reminding us that it was 
1990. Jerusalem had been destroyed numerous times, and might be again. 
</P>
<P>
Near the mosque lie the ruins of the last temple, including the Western or 
Wailing Wall, built by Herod as a retaining wall around his temple. It is said 
that Titus spared it as a reminder of Rome's power. There is a large court 
before the wall. Not only does it accommodate Jews praying, chanting, and 
genuflecting, but also hundreds of tourists who try to maintain a respectful 
distance. I saw a sentry on a rooftop, armed with an automatic rifle, looking 
down. Peace in the Holy City is always temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Our group trudged uphill along the Via Dolorosa, the path Jesus is said to have 
taken, bearing his cross, from his sentencing to his Crucifixion. It is a 
narrow, crowded walk between rows of shops and bazaars. Mark Twain noted that a 
cat could jump from the roof of one side to the roof of the other. The stones 
are rough and uneven. My legs began to hurt and my feet swelled. 
</P>
<P>
Finally we entered the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Christianity's most sacred 
shrine. It was built in 1149 by the Crusaders, over the ruins of many previous 
structures, and over the site of Calvary, the rock on which Jesus was 
crucified. Crowds were milling about and I'm not sure I saw the rock, but I 
think I did, and that's just as good.

Charges Dropped: Prosecutors in Aspen, Colo., on Wednesday dismissed drug and 
explosives charges against gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, 52, saying 
discrepancies in the testimony of chief accuser Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, and 
others would make it difficult to prove the charges in court. Thompson said a 
"celebratory orgy" would be held at a local tavern. 
</P>
<P>
Royally Late: Prince Charles and Princess Diana finally received a wedding gift 
nine years after they were married, when they opened the Prince and Princess of 
Wales Hospice in Glasgow, Scotland. The royal couple, married July 21, 1981, on 
Tuesday chatted with patients and toured the facility, which took years to 
finance and construct. 
</P>
<P>
Open for Business: The Czechoslovak government on Tuesday presented Mother 
Teresa with the keys to a former army villa in Prague. A government statement 
said the facility would be available for "the old and the helpless, sick 
children or other disadvantaged groups." Mother Teresa is a winner of the Nobel 
Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Recovering: Former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) was recovering Wednesday from 
surgery that removed a cancerous prostate gland, Zale Lipshy University 
Hospital officials in Dallas said. Tower, 64, underwent the procedure Tuesday. 
Said Tower from his hospital room: "I'll be out of here in a week and I'll be 
back to normal again real soon." Tower was rejected by the Senate as President 
George Bush's nominee as defense secretary.

SHATTERING PERCEPTIONS ABOUT RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dianne Klein's Commentary, "Shattering the Silence on Rape" (May 24), was 
outstanding. Again, however, an "authority" on rape has alluded to men's 
insensitivity to rape victims by stating, and thereby reinforcing, the 
perception that, "a lot of men are . . . very uncomfortable talking about rape 
. . . see the woman as having been dirtied . . . it was her fault . . . they 
are damaged goods." 
</P>
<P>
I am offended by (counselor) Marlene Phillips' statement. 
</P>
<P>
I state categorically that among my friends and acquaintances, with men whom I 
meet while traveling or socially, I have yet to hear a man describe a rape 
victim in terms other than those of sorrow, frustration, sympathy; the 
perpetrator as anything but an SOB; and the act as anything but pure, 
unadulterated savagery. 
</P>
<P>
While I'm on the subject: In 30 years as a police officer, I have never seen an 
officer regard the victim of a rape except as the victim of the most horrendous 
crime, short of murder. Believe it or not, policemen do take their badges off. 
And when they do, they become fathers of daughters, husbands of wives and 
brothers of sisters.

DIFFERING VIEWS OF DAY-CARE DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was enlightening to find that 68% of pediatricians think it's detrimental 
for a baby under the age of 6 months to be cared for by day care. 
</P>
<P>
Even ducks spend more than the two-week maternity leave many human mothers feel 
is adequate for bonding. 
</P>
<P>
Our economy and values are so screwed up, we ignore the needs of babies. There 
should be a new charity, "Whaaaa! I want my mommy!" Mothers who want to stay 
home with their babies could go to this fund to pay them to stay with their 
newborns. The best day care is do-it-yourself. Are you listening, legislators?

ERMA BOMBECK: WHEN EATING IS AN ACT OF KINDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not what you would call your highly motivated dieter. There are no 
reunions in sight, I am not under the gun to slim down for a beauty pageant, 
and I can still cross my legs in hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say I don't watch what I eat. It means I acknowledge that there 
are times in a person's life when turning down food is just not possible. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I have a little cabin about four hours north of our home. We 
have traveled the road often enough to know that my kidney capacity reaches its 
peak seconds after we pass into the small town of Payson, Ariz. (All of this 
has been documented.) There are no public facilities, and it is too soon to buy 
gas. Therefore, we must stop at a fast-food chain so I can use the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Am I going to march right by all those people who have bought the right to use 
the restrooms? Get real. I do the honorable thing and order breakfast. I 
certainly am not going to corrupt my principles and compromise my integrity for 
a lousy sausage and egg on a biscuit. 
</P>
<P>
I also eat on airlines -- for humanitarian reasons. It's not the flight 
attendants' fault that the shrimp is limp and the omelet has the consistency of 
a handbag. It would hurt their feelings not to take a stab at it. When you 
cruise up and down those aisles watching faces frozen in horror as people bury 
their food under their napkins, it gets through to you. People can take just so 
much rejection. On international flights, when you're flying from one time zone 
to another, I have eaten four meals in five hours. It's the only thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I eat in hospitals is threefold. First, I am paying $800 a day for 
it. Second, if you leave so much as a piece of parsley on your plate, a 
nutritionist will appear at your elbow demanding to know why you don't want to 
get well. And third, it's something to do between your bath and your back rub. 
</P>
<P>
Dieters will stubbornly hold out and say that my theory is without substance. 
They will contend that if you're really serious about cutting back, you will 
not have regard for feelings, courtesy or even integrity. I disagree. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago I went to Russia to have a dialogue with Russian women on peace 
between our two countries. They held a tea and brought in 50 or 60 desserts and 
insisted each one be sampled. That was a great personal sacrifice for me. I 
wasn't even hungry. But look what I did for all mankind!

<TEXT>
<P>
Call her 1990's Tracy Chapman . . . this decade's Chrissie Hynde . . . or even 
a new generation's Patti Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Too much praise for a 23-year-old Irish singer-songwriter with just two albums 
to her credit? 
</P>
<P>
Not if you've heard Sinead O'Connor's seductively tender version of Prince's 
"Nothing Compares 2 U" or her hauntingly personal "I Do Not Want What I Haven't 
Got" album -- or if you saw her concert on Tuesday at San Diego State 
University's Open Air Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In the unending parade of pop faces and styles, O'Connor offers traces on 
record and on stage of being a trailblazer -- someone like Chapman, Hynde and 
Smith who not only entertains and inspires, but also lifts our expectations of 
pop music. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's songs of personal exorcism and spiritual transformation are so 
intimate and unguarded that you feel at times you're eavesdropping in a 
confessional -- or overhearing a stormy scene in a bedroom, or in one song 
witnessing the final, bitter goodbys of a couple in an attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor -- who continues her U.S. tour with sold-out shows tonight and Friday 
at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles -- writes about betrayal and misjudgments 
with anger and fury, but she emerges from it all with a sense of optimism and 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to 
change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference," she whispered 
into the microphone at the start of Tuesday's concert, duplicating the familiar 
"Serenity Prayer" that opens her album. 
</P>
<P>
With just a trace of a spotlight on her, O'Connor stared into the darkness of 
the audience after delivering that prayer and sang "Feel So Different," a song 
about the changes in her own life. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I'd never seen 
</P>
<P>
 All you had spread before me 
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I'd never seen 
</P>
<P>
 That all I'd need was inside me. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined in the Me Decade of the '80s that the "first pop 
superstar of the '90s" -- as Rolling Stone magazine describes O'Connor -- would 
be someone proclaiming that you don't need what you haven't got. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the introspective, philosophical nature of her music, this 
head-spinning success could tempt O'Connor into presenting herself as some sort 
of precious angel -- an image she called to mind (no doubt inadvertently) when 
she walked on stage at one stop on her recent European tour in a hooded robe. 
</P>
<P>
By looking like a member of some exotic monastic order, O'Connor focused 
attention during that concert on the spiritual undercurrents in the album. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, O'Connor wore a leather jacket, jeans and cowboy boots, 
emphasizing the frisky, down-to-earth side of her personality and music. 
</P>
<P>
When O'Connor, an outspoken fan of rap music, took off the jacket, the 
lettering on her T-shirt spotlighted the playfulness even more. In a tip of the 
hat to the controversial Los Angeles rap group N.W.A, the front of the shirt 
read "P.W.A." -- for, as the lettering on the back explained, "Paddies With 
Attitude." 
</P>
<P>
As the concert (which was opened by low-key English soul singer Hugh Harris) 
proceeded, O'Connor moved from the cathedral-like tone of the opening number 
through the rock 'n' roll sass of "The Emperor's New Clothes," a tale of 
confrontation, to the sensual heat of "I Want Your (Hands On Me)." 
</P>
<P>
The thin, doleful-eyed Irishwoman underscored the latter expression of desire 
by caressing her body with as much eyebrow-raising abandon as anything Madonna 
exhibited in the bedroom fantasies in her "Blond Ambition" show. Where the 
Madonna caresses seemed choreographed, O'Connor's were more startling -- and 
sexy -- because they appeared to be spontaneous: a lightning flash of naked 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
It's precisely that quality that makes O'Connor so compelling. Like her shaved 
head, there is something strikingly unadorned about everything she does on 
stage -- from the naturalness of her mostly understated manner to the way she 
uses her four-piece band. Instead of finding a place for them in every song, 
O'Connor was sometimes alone on stage, and sometimes was joined by just one 
other musician. 
</P>
<P>
Her greatest talent at this early point in her career is her singing, which 
moves between a whisper and a scream with the suddenness and authority of a 
stunt-car driver swerving to avoid an accident. 
</P>
<P>
But her most prized attribute may be her ability to infuse music with the most 
profoundly personal feelings, yet leave enough room for the audience to find 
its own emotional connection. 
</P>
<P>
She also demonstrates, in "Black Boys on Mopeds," an ability to move beyond her 
introspective feelings to reflect on social injustice. Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses 
</P>
<P>
 It's the home of police who kill black boys on mopeds. 
</P>
<P>
 And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want him to be aware that there's 
</P>
<P>
 Any such thing as grieving. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mother speaking intuitively in the line about leaving England, not a 
literal declaration. O'Connor, who is married and has a young son, hasn't left 
London in protest because she knows there is injustice everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But she left in the line in the song because it reflected her immediate 
impulse, and it's that uncensored freedom of poetic expression that connects 
O'Connor with the great artists in pop. This young talent has a long way to go 
to prove she is an artist for the ages, but her beginning is as inspiring as 
any in years.

NEA Ads: A liberal political action group will start a series of radio and 
print advertisements in defense of the National Endowment for the Arts in 
select markets targeted in part to reach key Republican members of Congress. 
The Washington-based People for the American Way said its radio spots -- 
scheduled to start running in some markets today -- will feature Garrison 
Keillor, Kathleen Turner and Colleen Dewhurst. Print ads -- scheduled to run 
starting in mid-June in the New York Times, USA Today, the Hollywood Reporter 
and Daily Variety -- include graphics of Roman images of nude women, complete 
with black rectangles and a headline reading, "Imagine if Jesse Helms had been 
a Roman senator." GREG BRAXTON

MICHELLE SHOCKED'S DANCE-HAPPY REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like Dylan when he "went electric" in '65, Michelle Shocked has alienated a 
number of fans and critics with her switch from folk-based songs to the 
seemingly less confrontational jump-blues-flavored music on her current 
"Captain Swing" album. The foment has been such that Shocked evidently thinks 
it necessary to justify the switch during her shows. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House on Tuesday the slight, impish singer wryly asserted that 
"political correctness has been a serious social disease for the last several 
years. . . . Don't make the mistakes I did." She went on to cite a cure, 
quoting radical forebear Emma Goldman: "What good's a revolution if I can't 
dance?" 
</P>
<P>
Shocked's flat-out wonderful, dance-happy music needed no explication: The 
wild, unfettered spirit of the singer and her six-piece Captain Swing Revue 
conveyed all the liberation one could ask for. Her voice is far from naturally 
suited to the rigors of a horn-blaring outfit, but, pushing its limitations, 
she communicated the crucial life and emotion often missed by more skilled 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
Though sometimes awash in the band's anarchic-but-tight musical melee, her 
lyrics remained politically incisive, and evocative of the byways of American 
life. Coupled with the still-potent solo folk finesse evidenced on the 
haunting, fragile reminiscence "Memories of East Texas," the "new" Shocked 
remains one of the best things to happen to American music in years. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked also appears tonight at the Bacchanal in San Diego, Friday at the 
Ventura Theatre in Ventura and Saturday at the Wiltern Theatre. JIM WASHBURN

DIGITAL UNDERGROUND CAN'T GET OVER THE HUMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a sad case of Humpty interruptus. 
</P>
<P>
As its show unfolded at the Palace on Tuesday, Digital Underground looked to be 
the long-awaited rap group willing to make its performance a true stage 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland outfit was a dizzying whirl of charged energy, with showers of 
confetti and Silly String creating a New Year's Eve environment. 
</P>
<P>
There was some stage fog for atmosphere, and on a salute to their fellow 
rappers the musicians hauled out huge cartoon masks of their rivals. The nasty 
stuff came across as more coarse than it does on the group's "Sex Packets" 
album, but DU did preserve some of its subtlety, trusting its storytelling 
enough to offer a gentler, more subtle tone now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there's nothing gentle or subtle about "The Humpty Dance," rap 
music's "Louie Louie" -- dumb, irresistible and essential. When DU's clown-star 
Humpty Hump started bouncing around and the booming bass line struck, the crowd 
erupted. The show was poised to blast off into untracked realms. 
</P>
<P>
But sorry -- it was over. A half-hour build-up to greatness instead dissolved 
into a guest-star party-jam encore with Tone Loc and Ice Cube, among others, on 
a crowded stage. Financial note: the ticket price for the 30-minute set (which 
was preceded by Mellow Man Ace's 20-minute stint) was $20. RICHARD CROMELIN

IT'S JERRY SEINFELD'S SHOW -- AND IT'S A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC's new comedy "Seinfeld" blows up a gale of wit and freshness. 
</P>
<P>
The first of its four episodes airs at 9:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, 
and here's hoping this very funny series does well enough in the ratings to 
earn a pickup somewhere down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Creatively, it's already made it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concept is not unlike the late, great "It's Garry Shandling's 
Show" on Showtime and Fox, "Seinfeld" has a distinct charm of its own, 
centering on the musings and missteps of stand-up comic Jerry Seinfeld, with 
his private life being threaded by related bits from his club act. 
</P>
<P>
Seinfeld, who co-created the series and wrote some of the episodes with Larry 
David, plays himself here with appealing naturalness, supported by Jason 
Alexander as his best friend, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as his ex-girlfriend Elaine 
and Michael Richards as his goofy neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
This is just the kind of amusingly off-center comedy now missing from NBC's 
lineup, one of those rare, delightful meshings of concept, cast and execution, 
with producer Tom Cherones providing inspired direction. Nothing is forced. 
</P>
<P>
This is a very creative approach to universal humor. In one episode, for 
example, Seinfeld tackles the problem of ending his friendship with a bore 
without hurting the man's feelings ("Listen, Joe, I don't think we should see 
each other anymore"). 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's premiere finds Seinfeld attempting to pursue a woman he meets at a 
party without disturbing his platonic relationship with Elaine. He contrives a 
meeting outside the woman's law office: "So . . . uh, do you date immature 
men?" And so on and so on. Great stuff. HOWARD ROSENBERG

WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN, AROMA'S UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aromatic wood chips provide an easy way to enhance the flavor of grilled foods. 
Use sparingly at first -- one or two handfuls -- then increase if more smoked 
flavor is desired. 
</P>
<P>
When soaked in water at least 30 minutes before using, the chips create intense 
smoke. For a lighter, more delicate flavor, use dry chips and replenish as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
If charcoal is the cooking fuel, place the chips directly on the hot coals just 
before beginning to cook the food. 
</P>
<P>
For gas grills, place the soaked or dry wood chips in a foil pouch pierced with 
holes or a foil cylinder open at the ends. When the chips have been soaked, 
position the pouch or cylinder directly on the lava rocks; for dry chips, clear 
a small area of lava rocks and place in contact with or near the flame. 
</P>
<P>
Metal boxes designed for holding chips are also available at stores 
specializing in grilling equipment. Follow directions on the packaging. 
</P>
<P>
All food should be smoked in a covered grill over low heat. This keeps it moist 
and allows the smoke to be concentrated around the food. 
</P>
<P>
Which wood to choose? Use the following information as a guide: 
</P>
<P>
Alder -- Northwest Indians originated the use of this local wood to cook 
salmon. Its mild, delicate flavor is excellent for all types of fish, but Alder 
may also be used with chicken, lamb and pork. 
</P>
<P>
Fruitwoods (Apple, Cherry, Peach, Pear, Pecan) -- Use with veal, poultry, game 
birds and pork. Also good with shellfish such as lobster and shrimp. The flavor 
of these woods is enhanced when a side dish featuring the matching fruit is 
part of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Hickory -- The most popular hardwood flavoring. Imparts a pungent, bacon-like 
flavor. Best used with ham, pork, beef and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
Kiawe -- An extremely hard wood from Hawaii that botanists claim is identical 
to mesquite. 
</P>
<P>
Maple -- A favorite in the Northeast. The strong, pungent aroma suits ham, 
pork, beef and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
Mesquite -- This Southwest wood is one of the hardest known; it also burns 
hotter than other hardwoods. The flavor is sweeter and more delicate than 
hickory but is still hearty and robust. Mesquite complements richly flavored 
meats such as duck and lamb, but may also be used for beef, poultry and fish. 
</P>
<P>
Oak -- Native to Southern Missouri and most parts of the South. Used for beef, 
pork, ham, game and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
Grapevine Cuttings -- Imparts a more delicate flavor than hardwoods. 
Recommended for most meats, fish and poultry.

IT'S INTREPID INDEXER WHO MAKES THOSE COOKBOOKS USER-FRIENDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE GRANT, Rose Grant is a Washington free-lance writer, author of Street 
Food (The Crossing Press, 1989) and an indexer of cookbooks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Author! Author! Standing ovation. Fame and fortune are yours at last. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, no one ever shouts Indexer! Indexer! But, along with editors, designers 
and proofreaders, we toil behind the scenes to turn a manuscript into a 
cookbook. Although we are never invited on talk shows, and almost no one is 
interested in our opinions, we grunts play a vital role. 
</P>
<P>
I am a cookbook indexer. Although I offer this information with some pride, the 
usual response, "how interesting!" is the most enthusiasm I can expect. Most 
people are too polite to yawn when I try to explain what I do, but when their 
eyes glaze over, I know I've lost my audience -- again. 
</P>
<P>
I can make a good case for an intelligent index being the key to a cookbook; it 
should not be an obstacle course that the user has to figure out while trying 
to prepare a dish. Who has not had the experience of trying to find a recipe 
that you just know is in the cookbook, only to be taunted and mocked by an 
unyielding index? Rather than fight, you make something else. 
</P>
<P>
I recall looking for a chocolate cake in a best-selling dessert cookbook. It 
was described as a heavenly cake well worth the pound of brown sugar it 
contained. All the information I had was that it was a chocolate cake with a 
pound of brown sugar. I couldn't find it. 
</P>
<P>
My honor was at stake. As an indexer, I usually can figure out where recipes 
hide, even if they are not where I think they should be. I sat down with this 
350 page book and began turning pages. Sure enough, in the middle of the book 
was Quick Mocha Surprise. The name of the recipe did not contain the word 
chocolate nor cake so it was not listed in either category; it was, however, 
listed under "Quick." Never mind that the cake was so important that it was on 
the cover of the book; a reader, who did not know the exact name of the recipe, 
had no access to it. 
</P>
<P>
The indexer has a mandate to make each cookbook useful. There are rules that 
one should try to follow, but they are only guidelines. The index should be a 
custom job, uniquely suited to the particular book. That's where the challenge 
lies. Since no two cookbooks are the same, there are no universal rules; 
indexing is a judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
A recipe for Grandma Greta's Romaine and Red Cabbage Slaw With Mustard Blue 
Cheese Dressing could be indexed eight different ways. But does that make 
sense? Even if you had unlimited space for the index (usually there is a line 
constraint) eight entries for one recipe is the lazy way to do it; you don't 
have to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
I would say that the most important entry for this recipe would be under 
"Salad," even though the word does not appear in the name. Although the rules 
say that each recipe should be listed by its name, here Grandma Greta doesn't 
give any useful information and could be omitted. Keeping in mind that the 
index is the means of access to the recipes, using it to acknowledge friends 
and relatives is not in the user's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
Also, recipes that start with a process -- baked, stewed, roasted -- do not 
have to be indexed under that first word. Not many people would say, "I think 
I'll roast something tonight" and then look in the index for something to 
roast. One exception is stir-fry. Some cooks might want to use the bits and 
pieces left in the refrigerator and would look in the index for a stir-fry. 
</P>
<P>
I'm often asked how I started in this unusual specialty. It is a story I love 
to tell. I had just lost my job as a school librarian and my ingenious daughter 
came up with the idea that I put together my library skills and my cooking 
skills and become a cookbook indexer. My one regret is that she didn't think of 
it twenty years sooner -- when she was in second grade. 
</P>
<P>
The other question I'm frequently asked is if I use a computer, and doesn't the 
computer do all the work for me. Yes, I do use a computer and, no, it doesn't 
do all the work. It does the tedious formatting and alphabetizing and reminds 
me not to spell mushrooms with three o's or to remove the j in chicjken, but it 
is a mindless, humorless machine. It does exactly what it is told to do, 
nothing more, nothing less. Fortunately, I make the important decisions, which 
gives the index its character. 
</P>
<P>
I decide how to set up each entry, how to best use the space allotted and even 
how to fiddle around with the alphabet. According to the rules, Eggplant and 
Tomatoes should come between Egg and Zucchini Frittata and Eggs and Bacon 
Souffle. But, I think that it is more useful to have all the egg dishes clumped 
together, so I clump under "Egg(s)." I guess that doesn't qualify as high 
drama, but for puzzle solvers, it is a working solution and makes my day. 
</P>
<P>
The real high drama comes at unexpected times. Recently, I got a frantic call 
from an editor to ask if the index that was due the following week could 
possibly be delivered tomorrow. Someone had put the book on the press, not 
realizing that the index was not there. They couldn't leave the book on the 
press until next week -- and to take it off and put it back on again would cost 
thousands of dollars. I had some idea of how an obstetrician feels when, after 
working through the night, he delivers a perfect baby in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
I keep looking (in vain) for a cookbook review that will comment on the index 
-- mine or anyone else's. But a reality of the cookbook business is that 
although cooks can't help being irritated by inadequate access to the recipe, 
no one buys a cookbook because it has a smashing index. But, my indexer's 
fantasy dies hard and I keep looking.

HOT OFF THE PRESS, HERE COME THE LATEST GUIDES TO THE GRILL

<P>
The Thrill of the Grill by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby 
</P>
<P>
(William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc.: $24.95) 
</P>
<P>
(Publication Date: June 14, 1990; 395 pages, 200 recipes, 32 pages of color 
photographs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine mingling the sizzlingly spicy flavors of equatorial foods and the 
sweet, smoky tastes of American Southern barbecue and you'll discover what this 
book is all about. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Chris Schlesinger opened the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, Mass. More 
recently he opened Jake and Earl's, a barbecue take-out next door. But the 
young chef is also a surfer; while searching for the perfect wave, he 
discovered equatorial food, which he describes as "highly spiced, usually 
grilled, and served in that informal, friendly fashion that goes with beaches 
and hot weather." With food writer John Willoughby, he has translated his 
findings into chapters of exotic tropical grilled meats, seafood and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
"Grilling creates no natural jus or any equivalent," note the authors. Who 
wants grilled shrimp without fresh salsa? The one here is made with chopped 
fresh pineapple, sweet peppers and ancho chiles. Then there's banana-green 
mango chutney, whose sweet tangy taste is in perfect balance with spicy pork on 
skewers. These grilling partners are contained in one special chapter called 
"Sambals, Blatjangs and Salsas." They're so unusual, they're worth the price of 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
But the accompaniments aren't all tropical. Schlesinger remembers barbecue 
parties at his parent's cottage near Virginia Beach, and adapts Southern 
standards such as piccalilli of corn and watermelon. Georgia peach chutney and 
Leesburg chowchow complement outdoor pork baby backribs and duck barbecue. He 
also touches on the Southwest: chipotle pepper mayonnaise with cilantro is an 
appropriate partner for the strong-character of grilled bluefish. 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute touches are the chef's trademark. He writes, ". . . a squeeze of 
lime, some fresh herbs, a chunk of spicy butter. I like my sauces to reach as 
many parts of the palate as possible simultaneously." His compound herbed 
butters of basil-lemon, rosemary-garlic or honey-sage melt over the warm food, 
adding a bit of richness, a bit of zing. 
</P>
<P>
Color illustrations, sound advice on grilling techniques, and interesting 
anecdotes all add to the thrill of this grilling book. As a bonus, it includes 
some desserts and beverages. Best of all, there's a useful pantry of unusual 
ingredients listed at the end.

365 Great Barbecue &amp; Grilling Recipes by Lonnie Gandara with Peggy Fallon 
</P>
<P>
(Harper &amp; Row: $15.95) 
</P>
<P>
(214 pages, no photographs, 365 recipes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Don't underestimate this book. Despite its lack of photographs and 
illustrations, it offers ideas for every day of the year. And it is an ideal 
working cookbook. The sleek red, white and blue cover is washable, and the book 
lies flat when opened so it is extremely easy to use. Finally, author Lonnie 
Gandara, a California culinary consultant with an advanced certificate from the 
Paris Cordon Bleu, has covered almost every grilling favorite you can think of. 
</P>
<P>
For hot beginnings, how about grilled quesadillas? Or try beef or pork satay, 
Southwestern frittata or a no-fuss grilled wheel of Brie. 
</P>
<P>
Most dishes have an American accent: hamburger is offered au poivre, Yankee 
Doodle chicken comes with butter and cider vinegar, spareribs are served "in 
the nude" with no gooey, fussy barbecue sauce. But there are also some sweet 
surprises: a dessert called chocolate-raspberried pound cake and all manner of 
drunken foods such as Scotch-soaked quail and grilled halibut with martini 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
"Smoke-Touched Salads" is a refreshing chapter. You'll expect good things from 
grilled and chilled steak salad, or grilled salad nicoise. Equally refreshing 
is the "Foiled Again" chapter -- which offers creamy pesto bread or nachos on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
A chapter on barbecue sauces, marinades and glazes offers delicious samplings 
such as Ragin' Cajun Sauce, Hong Kong BBQ Sauce and Black Olive Pesto. Not to 
be missed is Grilling Go-Withs, delightful accompaniments from salads to hot 
vegetables, rice and beans. 
</P>
<P>
The author makes it easy to decide from the start how long a dish takes to 
prepare, offering timing on preparation, marination and cooking. This would be 
a good gift for a beginning cook, as most recipes are quick, easy and 
completely unfrightening. 
</P>
<P>
The Art of Grilling: a Menu Cookbook by Kelly McCune 
</P>
<P>
(Harper &amp; Row: $14.95) 
</P>
<P>
(Paperback, 108 pages, color photographs throughout, 75 recipes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Flip through this sophisticated, beautifully photographed book and you may 
just want to get that fire going. A sequel to the award-winning "Grill Book" 
(Harper &amp; Row), Kelly McCune's latest opus is a barbecue bible for the 
'90s, offering more helpful tips, guidelines, product information and best of 
all, more innovative recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Updating begins with the latest information on grilling tools and equipment. 
McCune is aware of the heightened interest in smoked foods; she provides a 
section on smoke-cooking which details the latest word in modern smokers while 
also encouraging you to adapt your present grill for smoking. In the back of 
the book there is a helpful section listing equipment sources. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes are eclectic, concentrating on regional American cooking -- with a 
nod to the earthy food of the Southwest and the increasingly popular Far East 
influence. As captured by Viktor Budnik's camera, the foods become tantalizing 
works of art. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 menus are each designed around a grilled main dish; the creative meals 
include recipes for one or two grilled side dishes as well. Thai Barbecued 
Chicken is served with snow peas with toasted sesame dressing and silver 
noodles with cucumber, carrot and rice vinegar. A light seafood summer meal 
features grapevine-smoked whole salmon, trout and oysters, accompanied by fresh 
and dried bean salad and oven-roasted asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important chapters -- on marinades, sauces and relishes -- 
features 40 recipes. McCune divides the marinade groups into acidic marinades 
(for tenderizing and flavoring meats), oil marinades (give moistness, crispness 
and flavor to lean food, keep them from sticking to the grill), paste marinades 
(for savory crusts) and dry marinades (herb sprinkles to add just before 
grilling). 
</P>
<P>
The "Art of Grilling" takes down to earth grilling to artistic heights. It may 
just qualify for the most inexpensive coffee table book on a culinary subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinguishing flavor in Thai Barbecued Chicken is garlic, and plenty of 
it. The tangy taste of the garlic is balanced, however, by other flavors in the 
marinade: peanuts, coconut milk, palm sugar, cilantro and nam pla, or Thai fish 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 THAI BARBECUED CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
(from "The Art of Grilling") 
</P>
<P>
8 to 12 chicken pieces 
</P>
<P>
1 cup coconut milk 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup nam pla (fish sauce) 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup lime juice 
</P>
<P>
8 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
4 shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 cup unsalted roasted peanuts, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons curry powder 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons Thai palm sugar or brown sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
Leave skin on chicken, but cut away excess. Trim fat. Pat chicken dry. Combine 
coconut milk, nam pla, lime juice, garlic, shallots, peanuts, curry powder, red 
pepper flakes, palm sugar, salt and cilantro. Mix well in nonreactive dish. Add 
chicken pieces and toss well in marinade, coating well. Marinate at room 
temperature 2 hours, or at least 4 hours in refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Oil cooking rack. In covered grill over medium hot coals, grill chicken, bone 
side down, 12 minutes. Turn and cook another 10 to 12 minutes, skin side down, 
or until juices run clear when pierced with skewer. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 This spicy mustard glaze is a nice change from the tomato-based sauces so 
often used on ribs. Baking these in advance makes the grilling a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 KANSAS CITY-STYLE SPARERIBS 
</P>
<P>
(from "365 Great Barbecue &amp; Grilling Recipes") 
</P>
<P>
6 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
8 or 9 pounds pork spareribs (about 3 racks) 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 cup dark brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup coarse-grain mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup molasses 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
Rub garlic on both sides of ribs and season with salt and pepper. Arrange ribs, 
meat side down, on large baking sheet. Cover and bake at 350 degrees 1 hour, 
turning ribs after 20 minutes. (Ribs can be baked 1 day ahead. Remove to rack 
and let drain and cool. Then wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate.) In medium 
nonreactive saucepan, combine brown sugar, mustard, vinegar, molasses and dry 
mustard. Bring to boil. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove 
glaze from heat and let cool slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare hot fire. Place prebaked ribs, meaty side up, on oiled grill set 4 to 6 
inches from coals. Spread 1/3 of glaze over ribs and cook until bottom is 
browned, about 5 minutes. Turn ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Spread half of remaining glaze over ribs. Cook until meat side is browned and 
crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn ribs again. Spread remaining glaze on top. Grill 
until bottom side is well browned and crisp, about 5 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
Cut into individual ribs or portions for serving. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a variation of the dry rub commonly used in barbecue. The normal 
searing and crusting action of grilling is enhanced by the rub. 
</P>
<P>
GRILLED WEST INDIES SPICE-RUBBED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH GRILLED BANANAS 
</P>
<P>
(from "The Thrill of the Grill") 
</P>
<P>
Spice Rub 
</P>
<P>
4 chicken breasts, boned but not skinned 
</P>
<P>
4 firm bananas or firm-ripe plantains, peeled and halved lengthwise

plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours. Over medium hot fire, grill chicken, skin 
side down, 7 to 8 minutes or until well-browned and heavily crusted. Turn 
chicken and grill additional 8 to 10 minutes. Check for doneness by nicking 
largest breast at fattest point. Meat should be fully opaque with no traces of 
red. Remove chicken from grill. Put 1 teaspoon butter on each breast. 
</P>
<P>
Rub banana halves with oil and place them on grill, flat side down. Grill about 
2 minutes, or until flat sides are slightly golden in color. Flip them and 
grill additional 2 minutes. Remove banana halves from grill. Mix 1 tablespoon 
hot melted butter and molasses together and paint over bananas. Serve with 
chicken breasts and sprinkle both with little lime juice. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

FUN AND USEFUL ACCESSORIES FOR BARBECUE 
</P>

<P>
The center of the barbecue cannot hold. Fish fall apart, small things slip 
through the grating. Then the Gourmet Grid ($28.95) places wide, flat channels 
on top of the wire grid and we don't even need the center, because the 
porcelain-coated steel carries heat to the edges of the barbecue as well. 
</P>
<P>
Branding cattle is a tiresome business that involves wrestling down doggies in 
a stench of burning cowhide. Branding steaks is a lot more fun. To put your own 
initials on your lunch you need a branding iron, like the kind hand-made on an 
Texas ranch by Texart (P.O. 33187, Corpus Christi, Tex. 78463); three initials, 
$18.50. 
</P>
<P>
Odorless, non-explosive: high virtues indeed. Weber has come out with a 
charcoal starter in the form of compact, nontoxic cubes that light even when 
wet and burn for about 15 minutes. Twenty cubes to a $3.99 tray; available at K 
Mart and other Weber outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Like a remora fish attaching itself to a shark, the Ash Catcher (from Charcoal 
Companion; $13.50) attaches to the legs of a kettle barbecue and positions its 
mouth to pick up the leavings. At last the ashes dribbling from the kettle have 
a safe place to rest until the family ash monitor gets around to emptying it 
into a garbage bag. At the Broadway and Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
How do you handle something soft and flaky on a grill? A grilling basket with a 
nice long handle, of course, and Charcoal Companion has developed the Ultimate 
Grilling Basket System ($39.95) with a removable handle so the grill can be 
closed for a smokier flavor. At the Broadway and Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
You can customize a wimpy grill by adding aromatic wood chips. Charcoal 
Companion's Smoking Woods Sample Pack ($14.99) includes apple for traditional 
American barbecue, mesquite, and the grape vine trimmings traditional with fish 
in France, along with a metal box to hold the woods in the barbecue. At the 
Broadway and Robinson's.

SEVERAL BRIGHT SPOTS NOTED AT RECENT WINE INDUSTRY EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other gatherings of wine people in Northern California recently all had 
doom and gloom behind them. They were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A daylong financial symposium staged by the San Francisco investment 
banking house Hambrecht &amp; Quist addressed, among other issues, the 
profitability of wineries based on volume and case prices. In one report, 
financial analysts said California wine prices had risen too high, and the 
experts predicted that prices may soon have to be cut or discounts offered 
because consumers are weary of paying high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the initial meeting of the newly formed Society of Blancs, focusing on 
the travails of white Sauvignon, participants heard various industry leaders 
offer schemes to sell more Sauvignon Blanc. One suggestion: junk the name Fume 
Blanc (which means the same thing as Sauvignon Blanc) because it is confusing 
to the public, who thinks the wines are different. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An impressive array of Italian wine producers unveiled the glories of 
Italian wines in a promotion that may have been aimed, in part, at justifying 
escalating prices. In the April issue of Decanter, a British wine magazine, 
Master of Wine Nicolas Belfrage wrote, "The main problem for the future of 
Italian wines on international markets is the price-quality ratio." He noted 
that recent price increases for Italian wine "are not realistic and may prove 
suicidal. Just as the Italians are getting a reputation for really good value, 
short-term greed steps in." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Physicians and lawyers looked at the issues surrounding warning labels and 
the proposed increased taxation of wine at a meeting of the energetic American 
Wine Alliance for Research and Education. In one presentation, a heart 
specialist, Dr. Arthur Klatsky, gave a presentation showing scientific studies 
that showed that moderate wine consumption (two glasses a day) can help reduce 
the risk of heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The annual national convention of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers Assn. 
looked at how to sell more alcoholic beverages in the face of escalating 
neo-Prohibitionism. The trade event attracted hundreds of alcoholic beverage 
wholesalers and retailers from around the country. DAN BERGER

DIFFERENCE OF OPINION OVER L-TRYPTOPHAN USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR FOOD EDITOR: 
</P>
<P>
I was greatly disturbed by the April 26 column "Food &amp; Common Sense" by Dr. 
Jean Mayer and Jeanne Goldberg that insinuated L-Tryptophan, when taken as a 
nutritional supplement, is hazardous to health. 
</P>
<P>
They claimed a rare blood disorder that created a recent wave of illness and 
death was brought on by the vitamin supplement form of L-Tryptophan, and they 
discounted the possibility that a contamination in a particular batch might 
have been the cause. 
</P>
<P>
The same day their column appeared, an article in the Washington Post reported 
that Centers for Disease Control researchers had traced all of the fatalities 
and illnesses in question to contaminated L-tryptophan made by a Japanese 
manufacturer -- Showa Denko Co. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, people who maintain a diet of properly prepared, well-balanced 
meals, organically grown in environmentally pure conditions -- and who get 
plenty of rest and exercise -- may not need nutritional supplements. However, 
it is widely agreed that for those who don't always eat right -- and for 
smokers, drinkers, the aged, athletes and others with special needs -- 
additional nutrients are required. It would be unfortunate if the 
Mayer-Goldberg attack affected any of the individuals who need a supplemental 
"insurance policy."

GRILL SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich proclaimed, "Use a barbecue, 
go to jail" last March, it ignited a fire under the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor referred to an SCAQMD proposal, Rule 1174, that would ban 
charcoal lighting methods that are hazardous to the environment. If approved, 
the law would prohibit sales of bag-light charcoal, charcoal lighter fluid, 
self-lighting charcoal, cube starters and ethanol gel. 
</P>
<P>
These have been proven to pollute the ozone through their release of reactive 
hydrocarbons. In Los Angeles, a mecca for outdoor cookery, three to four tons 
of the fumes are released each day. On holidays, that figure jumps to six or 
seven tons. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the supervisor's remark and public fears that this ruling would intrude 
on the rights of barbecuers, the SCAQMD said the proposed law will simply set 
standards for charcoal-lighting products similar to those for paints and other 
hazardous materials. It will ban the sale of products that fail to meet the 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean anyone has to stop barbecuing," said Bill Kelly, spokesperson 
for SCAQMD, "because there are other ways to light a fire." 
</P>
<P>
The law provides acceptable methods of igniting barbecue charcoal. These 
include the chimney with paper tinder, the electric probe, natural gas, propane 
and treated wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
And the SCAQMD isn't the only group that has voiced concern about the hazards 
of barbecuing. The American Institute for Cancer Research says that although 
more research into the area is needed, there appears to be a link between 
cancer and charcoal-broiled foods. 
</P>
<P>
One theory is that cooking on an outdoor grill converts some of the proteins in 
the meat into products that damage the genetic material of human cells. DNA 
damage has been linked to cancer development. 
</P>
<P>
Another hypothesis is that the fat that drips onto hot coals or stones forms a 
known carcinogen, benzopyrene. The smoke that rises from the fire carries this 
substance up to the meat and deposits it on the surface and that, it is feared, 
leads to cancer development. 
</P>
<P>
Charring of food is also seen as a problem because another carcinogen is 
released when food is burnt. 
</P>
<P>
The institute emphasizes, however, that there is no evidence that occasional 
summer cookouts increase cancer risk. It offers the following tips for more 
frequent grill users. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Select meats that are low in fat for a lower production of carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover the grill with foil before cooking, then punch a few holes to allow 
the fat to drip off and protect the food from smoke damage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook meat until done -- but avoid charring it. Remove any blackened surface 
matter from the foods. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Discourage flare ups. Keep a squirt bottle full of water handy for 
dampening coals that become too hot or flare up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a drip pan whenever possible but make sure it doesn't rest on the 
burning coals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Precook poultry, ribs and vegetables to reduce the cooking time on grills 
and cut down on the amount of fat released. Then grill briefly to add a subtle 
grilled flavor.

TAKING MYSTERY OUT OF ETHIOPIAN COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BURUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
C &amp; K Importing, 2771 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 737-2970 or (213) 
737-2880. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethiopian food is distinctive, as spicy and exotic as Indian or Moroccan food 
but heartier and earthier. It's a real crowd-pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
But until now, it hasn't been the sort of thing you'd want to do very often. To 
cook ye-doro wet', the national dish of stewed chicken, you'd have to make a 
complicated mixture of spices, some rather hard to get, and then you'd have to 
clarify butter, also with rare spices. And before serving the dish you'd have 
the indescribably tricky and frustrating chore of making the national griddle 
bread, without which Ethiopian food just isn't Ethiopian. 
</P>
<P>
Our luck has changed. C &amp; K Importing, a well-known Greek and Middle 
Eastern market in Los Angeles, now has an Ethiopian section selling spices, 
clarified butter, and anything else you'd want for an Ethiopian meal (and an 
Ethiopian cookbook to explain the uses). 
</P>
<P>
* The three classic spice mixtures found in most Ethiopian dishes: berbere, 
essential for ye-doro wet'; awaze, virtually the same list of ingredients as 
berbere, but in different proportions; mit'mit'a, the hottest spice mixture. 
</P>
<P>
* Nit'r k'ibe: Clarified butter, full of the aroma of spices, especially 
cardamom. 
</P>
<P>
* Injera: The devilishly tricky Ethiopian griddle bread is available in plastic 
bags. They look a little like washcloths, but they're tasty and surprisingly 
practical. You spread some on your plate or dining tray (see below) and ladle 
the dishes onto them. Every diner gets a couple of these breads to eat with; 
you tear off a swatch, pick up some food with it and pop the packet into your 
mouth. When the meal is over, you can eat the injeras on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
* Shiro: Pea flour, used for porridge. 
</P>
<P>
* Kwant'o: a sort of beef jerky dusted with berbere. It's eaten as a snack or 
added to pea flour porridge. 
</P>
<P>
* Fasting foods: Nick Solomonidis, C &amp; K's resident Ethiopian sales person, 
reminisces about fasts in Ethiopia, where the meatless season adds up to an 
astounding 200 days a year. "Before Easter we fast 40 days," he said, "as well 
as two days every week. On those days we eat wet' made with lentils or beans 
instead of meats." The store stocks many varieties in all hues of orange, 
yellow and brown, lined up like clear plastic-covered bean bags on the back 
wall shelves. 
</P>
<P>
* Sambousa: The familiar Near Eastern/Indian turnover is made with flaky pastry 
and filled with spicy meat. There's also a vegetarian version, misser sambousa, 
filled with lentils, available around Easter time. 
</P>
<P>
* Ethiopian coffee: C &amp; K sells beans from Ethiopia's coffee-making 
capital, Harar, both darkly roasted or green. Often cardamom and a pinch of 
salt are added to Ethiopian coffee but traditionally it is not sweetened in the 
cup. Instead, one can take a little honey (Ethiopia is famous for its honey) 
under the tongue before each sip, mixing the sweet and aromatic liquids before 
each swallow. 
</P>
<P>
* Coffee pot: Ethiopian coffee is brought to the boil seven times in a ceramic 
coffee pot called jabana, also available here. After it is boiled, the coffee 
is poured into a cup until it overflows the lip. "The custom, from times when 
political enemies took coffee together," Solomonidis said, "assured that no 
poison, which might have been put in, remained in the cup." To reassure his 
guests further, the host also took the first sip of coffee, and this custom 
also remains. 
</P>
<P>
* T'alla: Ethiopian beer. 
</P>
<P>
* T'ej: an ancient variety of mead wine, fermented from honey and flavored with 
gesho, Ethiopian hops. 
</P>
<P>
* Other coffee paraphernalia: Coffee drinking has much ceremony attached to it, 
and in a corner next to the deli case, several shelves hold accouterments for 
the ritual: frankincense, ornate brass incense burning dishes and the little 
logs of charcoal you place the incense on. 
</P>
<P>
* Dining ware: In addition to its Ethiopian ingredients, C &amp; K stocks the 
large, round, enameled Ethiopian dining tray and the traditional hand-woven 
rush table (mes'ob) it is placed on, so you can serve the food authentically. 
Each table, with its own unique multicolored design, has a dome-shaped lid that 
keeps the meal warm. 
</P>
<P>
 You might wonder how a Greek market that has served Los Angeles Greeks since 
1948, one that sells take-out souvlakia, gyros and Greek coffee in an adjoining 
cafe, came to carry Ethiopian products. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually pretty logical," says Chrys Chrys, C &amp; K's owner. "The 
Greeks have always been purveyors of food in the Middle East and to some extent 
in Ethiopia. So when Middle Easterners first came over here they'd look for 
provisions of 'the Greek store' as a matter of habit. And, of course, many of 
our ingredients are the same." Ethiopian food was just another step, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Many of C &amp; K's longtime customers have been ordering their whole baby lamb 
or lokanika (a wonderful Greek sausage made with wine, orange peel and a hint 
of fennel seed), since the time when the store bordered a Greek community. The 
Greek Orthodox Church is just a stone's throw away. And on Sundays, even before 
the last bell has tolled at the end of services, a stream of regulars is 
stocking up on kourambies, the S-shaped Greek butter cookies, loukoumi, 
jewel-like fruit candies and the shop's ready-to cook, home made Greek 
turnovers -- spinach filled spanakopites or cheese filled tiropites. 
</P>
<P>
During the mad Sunday rush, as I stand scrutinizing the rows of Ethiopian 
spices, Chrys finds a moment to pull me over to the deli case. "Look at this," 
he says, snatching the lid from a pint container of a bright red sauce. "Its 
awaze jam, a liquid sauce made from the spice mixture. You can simply eat it 
with injera or pour some of it over cooked meat. It makes an almost instant 
Ethiopian meal." 
</P>
<P>
Almost instant. Our luck has changed. 
</P>

THE HAMBURGER OF THE FUTURE?

Move over, McDonald's. Japanese and South Korean companies are hoping that 
instant noodles will soon join such staples as borscht and goulash on the 
dining tables of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, this would mark yet another conquest by a product dreamed up 
slightly more than 30 years ago as a way of marketing inexpensive and abundant 
American wheat. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest assault, Japan's Toyo Suisan Kaisha plans to ship 30 million 
packets of noodles annually to Eastern European countries and has targeted the 
Soviet Union in particular. 
</P>
<P>
It plans to ship 20% of the production of a U.S. factory due to start 
operations in June, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big challenge for us because both Eastern and Western Europe are 
virgin markets for us," he said. "But demand there is expected to be strong, 
because the population of the Soviet Union alone is 1.5 times greater than that 
of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market for instant noodles has grown rapidly to $300 million a year 
from nothing 20 years ago, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instant noodles have become the best-known Japanese food in the world. Even 
sushi and soy sauce are only popular in some parts," said Tsutomu Kobayashi, an 
official at the Japan Convenience Foods Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Some 13 billion packets of instant noodles a year are sold in 80 countries, 
association figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Nissin Food, the company that pioneered instant noodles, also plans to export 
the product to Eastern European countries beginning next year, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
It hopes to export from a factory in India, due to open in December. The plant 
is a joint venture with Brooke Bond and Company, a British subsidiary of the 
Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. 
</P>
<P>
The plant will be exporting four million packets, or one-tenth of its output, 
to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union by 1992, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Samyang Food Co. of South Korea said that it hoped to begin exporting 
noodles to the Soviet Union. It will ship two container loads worth $20,000 to 
test the market, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan started exporting instant noodles in 1960, just two years after they were 
invented by Momofuku Ando, Nissin's founder. 
</P>
<P>
Ando came up with the idea of an inexpensive, nutritious and convenient food 
suited to the Japanese palate and made easily from the ample stocks of wheat 
given to Japan by the U.S. government after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, people were starving and lining up for noodles at street stalls," 
said Tastuya Ukon, a Nissin spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Imported wheat still accounts for most Japanese production of the food, known 
here as ramen and in Korea as ramyon. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of selling noodles in disposable foam cups -- enabling diners to cook 
them simply by adding hot water -- was introduced in Japan in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The latest innovation, also introduced by Nissin, is self-heating containers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, instant noodle output in Japan reached 4.6 billion packages. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sure instant noodles will become popular in every country," said 
Nissin's Ukon.

THE HOMECOOK: A PERFECT SUMMER SUPPER STARTS WITH AN EASY-TO-FIX TRI-TIP ROAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strangers are cooking for us, and our kitchens are gathering dust. 
</P>
<P>
In today's world people are increasingly turning to ready-made food. The modern 
supermarket offers salad bars, spit-roasted meats and poultry, and pre-prepared 
menus just waiting to be taken home. Delis beckon. 
</P>
<P>
This is a shame, because cooking at home can be as good for you as exercise, as 
relaxing as a Jacuzzi. And home-cooked food can be plain, good and above all, 
easy to make. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who juggle long work hours and tedious commutes might find that, in 
the long run, they spend less time preparing a fast home-cooked meal than they 
do standing in line to pay for a quick food fix. 
</P>
<P>
The way to begin, if you haven't been cooking much, is to prepare only two 
dishes -- -- a principal dish and a dessert. To balance the main course, try a 
raw vegetable side dish. What you end up with is a perfect supper. 
</P>
<P>
In quick cooking, the quality of the raw ingredients is of primary importance. 
But most modern supermarkets offer not only a long line of convenience foods, 
but an increasingly upgraded stock. Ironically, just as it is getting easy to 
buy better ingredients, we are cooking less. 
</P>
<P>
Today's menu is one I prepare often with foolproof results: Tri-tip Beef Roast 
with Carrots, Potatoes and Onions accompanied by Relish Salad. Summer pudding 
with a pouring of heavy cream is a grand dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-tip beef roast, or triangle tip is the boneless part of the bottom sirloin, 
and usually weighs between 1 1/2 ounces and 3 pounds. It is sometimes cut into 
cubes for kebabs, or cut into coulotte steaks. The flavor is always 
exceptionally good. It's so tender it also takes well to grilling. 
</P>
<P>
Crunchy Relish Salad can be made the day before, as can the summer pudding. The 
pudding is a magical concoction that transforms three simple ingredients into 
the most ethereal dessert. 
</P>
<P>
RELISH SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons brown sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chopped cabbage 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped green pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
Combine salt, brown sugar, dry mustard and cider vinegar in bowl and stir until 
blended. Add cabbage, green pepper and celery and stir until all is well mixed. 
Serve chilled. Makes 3 cups. 
</P>
<P>
TRI -- TIP BEEF ROAST WITH CARROTS, ONIONS, POTATOES 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons shortening or peanut oil 
</P>
<P>
1 (2 1/2-pound) trip-tip beef roast 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
6 medium-size carrots, peeled and parboiled 
</P>
<P>
8 medium-size new potatoes, parboiled 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon dried rosemary, crumbled (or 2 tablespoons fresh) 
</P>
<P>
2 medium onions, sliced 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
Heat shortening in large saute pan or Dutch oven. Liberally season to taste 
both sides of roast with salt and pepper. Brown in hot shortening, turning, 
until both sides are deep mahogany brown. 
</P>
<P>
Add carrots and potatoes, sprinkle with rosemary and season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Add onion slices and water. Bring to simmer, cover and cook 30 
minutes. Check for doneness by cutting into thickest part of meat. (It usually 
takes 35 to 45 minutes to reach medium rare.) Don't overcook. Remember that 
meat continues to cook little after removed from heat. Arrange meat and 
vegetables on platter and serve hot. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Optional Gravy: After removing roast to serving platter, sprinkle 3 tablespoons 
flour over pan drippings, cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until 
thick and smooth. Slowly stir in 2 cups of water. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. When sauce has thickened, pour into bowl and serve with roast and 
vegetables. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
SUMMER PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
7 slices dense white bread (Pepperidge Farm type), crusts removed 
</P>
<P>
5 cups raspberries 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar (or to taste) 
</P>
<P>
Line round 4-cup bowl with bread, filling in all crevices so bowl is completely 
covered. Leave enough bread to cover top after filling with berries. 
</P>
<P>
Toss berries and sugar together. (If you have spare couple of minutes, put 
berries and sugar into large skillet and heat them for 1 minute so sugar 
dissolves and mingles better. But this step isn't necessary.) 
</P>
<P>
Fill bread-lined mold with sweetened berries. Cover top with bread. Weight 
gently by placing heavy object over bread (an unopened can of tomatoes, for 
example). 
</P>
<P>
Chill in refrigerator at least 6 hours or overnight. Serve with whipping cream. 
Makes 4 to 6 servings.

2-A SECTION BASEBALL FINAL; 
</P>
<P>
TIME, TALENT ADD UP FOR GROSSMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inexperience of last year gave way to poise and confidence this year as 
Grossmont's baseball team captured its first San Diego Section championship 
Wednesday with a 5-2 victory over San Diego at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothillers (29-2), 18th in the nation by USA Today and first in the 
county, put behind two losses -- 7-4 to Carlsbad in the last year's 2-A final 
and 6-5 to San Diego earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between this year and last? 
</P>
<P>
John Tatum, who earned his 13th save with two innings of hitless relief, said 
they were Coach Jeff Meredith and experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Meredith really pulled us together," Tatum said. "He's given us a lot of 
confidence in ourselves. Last year, we were just inexperienced. We had never 
been there before." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the explosive Grossmont offense, which averaged 10 runs a game 
during the season, was kept pretty well in check by San Diego's pitching, 
producing just seven hits. But the Foothillers' pitching, lost in the offensive 
hoopla during the regular season, held San Diego to just one earned run, three 
hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Mike Spears (7-0) allowed just two hits and no walks in four scoreless 
innings before giving way to Dan Lennon, who gave up an unearned run in one 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew if we got ahead, we could hold them," Grossmont catcher Todd Cady 
said. "Our pitching has been great all year." 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont scored an unearned run in the first on three San Diego errors and 
took a 2-0 lead in the second on Lennon's home run over the right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out with some nerves," San Diego Coach Tom Lopez said. "It's tough 
to play when you are tense." 
</P>
<P>
After scoring an unearned run of their own in the fifth, San Diego gave 
Grossmont two more in the sixth. Starter Josh Stepner (7-2) allowed a leadoff 
triple to Tatum, and reliever Kian Sly walked Jason Eskridge, hit Lennon and 
walked Rob Roberson to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jacque Jones replaced Sly and appeared to be getting out of the inning 
after striking out Wynter Phoenix and getting Mark Landers to hit a pop-up 
behind first. But San Diego second baseman Brett Sartain overran the ball, and 
it dropped in fair territory, allowing the fourth Grossmont run to score. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (20-8) scored its second run in the sixth when Stepner walked, stole 
second, went to third on a wild pitch and scored a on fielder's choice by 
catcher Jeff Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Stepner, who hit a three-run homer to beat Grossmont in the first meeting, said 
he was hoping to get up one more time with runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we played them we got the walks and the hits when we needed 
them," said Stepner, who on Tuesday signed a baseball letter of intent with 
USD. "We used up all of our luck this year. I guess the man up there didn't 
want to give us any more."

S.D. EVANGELIST OFFERS $52 MILLION TO BUY SCANDALIZED PTL MINISTRY; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: MORRIS CERULLO HAS PUT DOWN $7 MILLION IN 'PHASE ONE' OF PURCHASE OF 
BAKKER-FOUNDED EMPIRE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Morris Cerullo, a faith healer who is head of the San Diego-based Worldwide 
Evangelism ministry, has offered to buy the assets of the scandal-plagued PTL 
ministry for $52 million. 
</P>
<P>
PTL, founded by defrocked TV evangelist Jim Bakker, has been in the control of 
U. S. Bankruptcy Court since June, 1987, two months after Bakker resigned from 
the ministry following the emergence of a sex-and-money scandal involving 
former church secretary Jessica Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker is serving a 45-year federal prison term in Minnesota after his 
conviction last October on fraud and conspiracy counts. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, 58, and his church are best known locally for having owned the El 
Cortez Hotel in San Diego, where he ran a short-lived evangelism school before 
selling the property in 1981. Cerullo also proposed a grandiose 200-acre 
retirement center and religious education center on land the church owned in 
the Mira Mesa area, but ended up selling the property to home builder Pardee 
Construction. 
</P>
<P>
PTL Trustee Dennis W. Shedd, an attorney in Columbia, S. C., confirmed 
Cerullo's offer, saying the preacher had put $7 million cash in an escrow 
account in Columbia to cover purchase of the PTL cable TV network and a 
broadcast production studio, which Shedd referred to as "phase one" of the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Shedd said Cerullo is in the process of securing financing to buy "phase two" 
of PTL: the 2,200-acre Heritage USA theme park in Ft. Mill, S. C., 15 miles 
south of Charlotte, N. C. The theme park, which includes a completed 500-room 
Heritage Grand hotel and another 500-room hotel still under construction, as 
well as a water slide, shopping mall and miniature railroad, has been closed 
since September. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, who was unavailable for comment Wednesday, intends to resume operation 
and development of Heritage USA as a religious theme park, Shedd said. Of the 
park's 2,200 acres, about 500 are developed. The Heritage USA phase of the sale 
to Cerullo is expected to close later this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shedd said he will file a motion today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Columbia seeking approval of the offer by Cerullo. A hearing was scheduled at 
the court this morning to consider a $6.3-million offer for PTL's cable TV 
network from evangelist Oral Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Shedd said the Cerullo offer is "a good deal (for the PTL estate) because it is 
the only package offer (for all PTL assets) that we have received, and the part 
of the package allocated to the network is more money than anyone has offered." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Canadian developer offered to buy the Heritage USA theme park, but 
the deal fell through after it became apparent that he could not obtain clear 
title to the property. Ownership of the land is disputed by an Indian tribe 
that has claimed in a lawsuit that the property was illegally taken from them 
by the U. S. government in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
The PTL satellite cable network consists of a leasehold interest in a cable TV 
satellite controlled by HBO and an "uplink," or earth-to-satellite transmission 
facility. The PTL network still operates, carrying other evangelists' 
programming, including Cerullo's, but no longer produces programming of its 
own, Shedd said. 
</P>
<P>
The PTL network is accessed by 800 cable TV systems across the United States, 
which in turn can reach 6.5 million households, Shedd said. In court documents, 
however, HBO has argued that Shedd has no power as trustee to transfer the 
leasehold interest in the satellite to a new buyer. It was unclear Wednesday 
whether HBO would dispute the sale of the network to Cerullo. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo was once a friend to Jim Bakker and appeared on the "Jim and Tammy 
Show," the once-popular program hosted by Bakker and his wife. Cerullo was 
ordained in the Assembly of God Church, the same denomination that defrocked 
Bakker in 1987 after the Jessica Hahn scandal but is not now affiliated with 
any particular denomination. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker allegedly had sex with Hahn and then made payments to her to hush up the 
incident. With the scandal broiling around him and his ministry drowning in 
financial problems, Bakker turned PTL operations over to preacher Jerry Falwell 
in April, 1987. Two months later, Falwell placed the ministry in bankruptcy and 
turned over its financial records to the U. S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, who grew up in a New Jersey orphanage, directs a ministry that 
produces videotapes and television programming and which conducts operations in 
Europe, Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe as well as in the United States. Worldwide 
Evangelism solicits funds from viewers and church members via direct-mail, 
telephone and televised appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The evangelist came under fire in the early 1980s when it came to light that 
trust funds from donors, some of whom were told they would receive lifetime 
income on their donations, were being invested in second and third trust deeds, 
a risky kind of mortgage loan. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo's Worldwide Evangelism bought the 250-room El Cortez Hotel in 1978 for 
$6.5 million, but was unsuccessful in making it a religious education and 
training center. During the two years the training center was open, Cerullo 
became involved in several disputes with contractors, students, real estate 
brokers and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo sold the hotel in 1981 to Denver developer Terry Considine, who 
unsuccessfully proposed it as the site of the San Diego Convention Center, 
which was ultimately built on Harbor Drive. Considine subsequently sold the 
landmark to the Grosvenor family, who last year formed a joint venture with 
Japanese investors to build a $250-million hotel complex.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: SOME HELPFUL HINTS FOR INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF FIBER 
IN YOUR DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would take roughly 14 oat bran bagels, a 1/2 pound of oat bran pretzels, 11 
cups of Cheerios, nearly three cups of oat bran flakes cereal or, depending 
upon the brand, four to seven oat bran muffins each day, to provide the amount 
of fiber in two ounces of oat bran. 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like a lot to swallow, consider: In studies of the highly 
concentrated form of fiber's cholesterol-lowering effect, the volunteers ate 
three ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is probably possible to achieve a cholesterol-lowering benefit by 
using these products, it places an undue emphasis on bran as a source of fiber. 
Other foods are equally valuable. 
</P>
<P>
A one-ounce serving (1/3 cup) of oat bran supplies about four grams of total 
fiber (a mix of soluble and insoluble). The same amount of rice bran offers 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Americans eat only about 11 grams of fiber daily -- 
equivalent to about one cup of kidney beans, three and a half apples or one and 
a half cups of chopped broccoli. The National Cancer Institute recommends up to 
35 grams daily for good health. 
</P>
<P>
With some simple menu substitutions, that goal is easy to accomplish. Including 
a morning serving of hot or cold bran cereal and a high-fiber muffin at lunch 
or dinner time is a good plan. Then, shift the menu focus to raw or lightly 
steamed vegetables, dried beans and legumes, fresh fruits, whole grains 
(including brown rice, which contains the bran), pastas, breads and cereals. 
This will simultaneously fill the stomach and make you feel less hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Eating whole wheat toast with one-half pat butter and one teaspoon jam instead 
of white toast and one pat butter will add two extra grams of fiber while it 
reduces the amount of fat in the diet. In the evening, if you substitute 
one-half cup cooked green peas (which supply eight grams of fiber) for green 
beans, which supply only three grams, you get an easy fiber bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Dietary fiber, roughage and bulk are terms that refer to the undigestible part 
of plants. Their fibrous texture causes these foods to act like a kitchen 
broom, sweeping the intestines and colon clean of wastes and helping to reduce 
constipation. Cancer experts say this can decrease risk for some forms of the 
disease. They report that people who eat a high fiber diet show a low incidence 
of most gastrointestinal ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Water insoluble fiber, is the thread or wood-like part of the husks and shells 
found in foods such as wheat bran, peas, dried figs, beans and legumes. It is 
not capable of holding onto water particles so it moves quickly through the 
digestive system, frequently taking toxic substances with it. 
</P>
<P>
Soluble fiber also has a positive effect on digestion. Found in the cell walls 
of oats, apples, pears and citrus fruits, it also has a role in reducing blood 
cholesterol levels. Since it does dissolve in water, it forms a gel-like 
substance in the intestines that slows digestion. This quality is important to 
diabetics and others who have medical conditions requiring a delay of the 
absorption of carbohydrates into the body. 
</P>
<P>
Both forms of fiber are important to good overall health. The American Dietetic 
Assn. warns, however, against eating more than 50 grams of fiber daily; it 
might have adverse effects such as decreased mineral absorption and stomach 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The following menus each supply about 30 grams of fiber per day. They are not 
intended for use on consecutive days. Rather, they are examples of how to 
substitute high fiber whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables for their 
refined, canned and otherwise processed counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Some normally low-fiber foods, such as pancakes and muffins are also included, 
but their fiber content has been increased by the addition of whole wheat flour 
and bran.

ICE CREAM SOLVES DILEMMA OF WHAT TO SERVE FOR DESSERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GILLINGHAM, Gillingham is a Los Angeles-based food writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inviting friends over for dinner used to mean scratch-building some elaborate 
dessert. If it didn't involve preparing a filling, frosting or one layer or 
another at least a day ahead, it didn't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at some stage of construction, I frequently gave up in frustration that my 
dessert would ever look like the pictured recipe. And I was never sure if the 
taste really was a disappointment or it was just the bad attitude I had worked 
up by the time it, and the rest of the dinner, was finished. 
</P>
<P>
Well, gone are the days of such desserts. It's not that I got any smarter, just 
tired. The day before a dinner party should be a day off for the cook. Besides, 
I like to visit with my friends, not miss the punch line of an after-dinner 
story because I'm in the kitchen warming some silly sauce to the degree needed 
to ignite en flambe. 
</P>
<P>
Now I serve ice cream. Just plain store-bought vanilla, although I usually 
choose French. All I need to do is stir up a quick topping to make it a dessert 
that friends seem to like as much as the fancier ones. No one has even asked me 
where the good old dessert days have gone. 
</P>
<P>
I like the contrast of a warm, boozy topping. But any of the ideas that follow 
could be served at room temperature with vanilla, almond extract or other 
flavoring replacing the liquor. 
</P>
<P>
Almond Sauce is actually part of a recipe from the old days. I used to serve 
French vanilla ice cream in puff pastry shells and set the sauce aflame. Now 
it's just ice cream and warm sauce. Hot Hazelnut Fudge turns a scoop of vanilla 
into the adult version of my favorite childhood treat. Scoops of vanilla go on 
top of the Brandied Bananas instead of the other way around. Or if there isn't 
any ice cream left, the bananas are almost as good on their own. 
</P>
<P>
ALMOND SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dark corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup sliced almonds 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons almond liqueur 
</P>
<P>
French vanilla ice cream 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter and brown sugar in small saucepan until sugar is dissolved. Stir in 
corn syrup and water. Add almonds and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat 
and stir in liqueur. Serve warm over ice cream. Makes about 2 cups sauce. 
</P>
<P>
HOT HAZELNUT FUDGE 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup half and half 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup toasted chopped hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons hazelnut liqueur, optional 
</P>
<P>
French vanilla ice cream 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate with butter in saucepan over very low heat, stirring until 
smooth. Stir in half and half, sugar and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, 
stirring constantly, until sugar is completely dissolved and sauce is hot. Stir 
in nuts and liqueur and heat 1 minute longer. Serve warm over ice cream. Makes 
about 2 cups sauce. 
</P>
<P>
BRANDIED BANANAS 
</P>
<P>
4 large, firm, ripe bananas 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup brandy 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
French vanilla ice cream 
</P>
<P>
Peel bananas and cut in halves, first crosswise, then lengthwise. Arrange in 
single layer in shallow buttered baking dish. Sprinkle with walnuts, brown 
sugar and brandy. Dot with butter. Bake at 400 degrees 8 to 10 minutes until 
sugar is melted. Serve warm topped with ice cream, spooning some of the sauce 
over ice cream. Makes 4 servings.

One of the few things that Councilman Evan Anderson Braude and challenger Bill 
Stovall have in common is that they are both running for the same downtown 
council seat. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the first-term incumbent and the retired deputy police chief part 
ranks. Whether the subject is expanding the police force, the homeless or 
historic preservation, Stovall and Braude often disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by the police union, Stovall ran on an anti-crime platform and emerged 
the top vote-getter of the three challengers running against Braude in the 
April primary, forcing the councilman into a runoff election on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to other local runoffs, the contest to represent the downtown and port 
areas has been a relatively docile affair, lacking the nasty exchanges and 
six-figure spending that have marked the races for mayor and the 3rd Council 
District. Stovall had spent about $39,000 on his campaign as of May 19, and 
Braude about $61,000. 
</P>
<P>
At 57, Stovall is making his first political bid, vowing to say no to many 
things that Braude has said yes to. 
</P>
<P>
One of the centerpieces of Stovall's campaign has been his opposition to the 
police funding proposition on next week's ballot, a proposal that Braude 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a political relief valve and further delay of the very tough 
decision that is going to have to be faced," Stovall complained of the measure, 
which would create a new property tax levy to pay for 75 additional police 
officers. "They just don't want to face it before the election -- that we are 
going to have to spend more money out of the general fund." 
</P>
<P>
A 30-year veteran of the Long Beach police force, Stovall argues that instead 
of asking residents for more property taxes, the council should increase police 
funding at the expense of other city departments. He proposes enlarging the 
public safety area's share of the general fund budget from 52% to 55%. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sort of Long Beach's answer to voodoo economics," retorts Braude, a 
42-year-old attorney for Mercury Savings &amp; Loan. "I certainly believe we 
can make some cuts in the administrative area, but those cuts would amount to 
maybe five additional police officers. I just don't see that as a viable 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
On another police matter, Stovall dismisses the recently approved Citizen 
Police Complaint Commission as a bad idea. The commission, under which civilian 
appointees will review police brutality complaints, is not necessary, Stovall 
says, because brutality cases have "been properly dealt with" by the 
department. Braude supported the commission. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most liberal members of the council, Braude has been more supportive 
than most of his colleagues to homeless and housing issues, favoring several 
proposals that housing activists have futilely tried to get the council to 
consider. Stovall has made it clear that he would not be so receptive. 
</P>
<P>
Stovall said he thinks the city has responsibility for only one category of 
homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts, for whom the city should operate a 
drop-in center. But he was adamant that the center, which would provide 
referral information, shower facilities and the like, not be opened downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should be spending money to stimulate an attraction to people 
who are going to walk the streets and panhandle," Stovall stressed, saying the 
drop-in center should be located in industrial areas at the edge of town. 
"We've got to move these people out. . . . If they don't like it, they can go 
someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Stovall also advocates stricter enforcement of local panhandling laws. "They're 
not to be pitied. They're probably making more money than you are," Stovall 
said of those who approach pedestrians with tales of poverty and hardship. 
</P>
<P>
On housing matters, Stovall supports the city's efforts to lower density in 
many of Long Beach's residential neighborhoods, and he says the downzoning 
should be continued. But he criticizes steps to channel high density apartment 
development to some of the major streets in the city, including some in the 1st 
District. The area already has enough such development, Stovall said, arguing 
that it should be spread to other parts of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that downtown apartment complexes "are clearly something we have to 
have for the economic viability of downtown," Braude nonetheless agreed that 
major streets elsewhere in the city should be zoned as high density, and he 
supported an unsuccessful attempt to accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding historic preservation, Stovall said the city should do no more than 
declare buildings as landmarks to aid preservation efforts. It should not, 
Stovall said, subsidize development projects involving historic buildings to 
save them from demolition. "This could be a nightmare. Where do you stop?" 
</P>
<P>
Braude has indicated that he would support giving financial help to historic 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Our district, more than any other district, is involved with historic 
preservation," he commented. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates also disagree on City Council raises. Stovall opposes a 
ballot proposal that would double the salary of council members to $35,500. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be easy for him to say because he's retired and gets full retirement 
pay," countered Braude, who says he spends at least 40 hours a week on council 
matters and deserves a raise, as do his colleagues.

CULVER CITY CRITICS BLOW WHISTLE ON PARK BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON ITO, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the weather heats up, so do the basketball games in Veterans Park as 
dozens of men, teen-agers and even a few women fill the air with rainbow jump 
shots, acrobatic drives to the hoop and the rhythmic thump of the ball on 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, park neighbors complain that the two courts, which they 
say sometimes attract more than 50 players at a time, have become a source of 
irritation as peaceful afternoons are shattered by the din of foul language and 
booming car stereos. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City Council is expected to consider in early June a recommendation 
from the Human Services and Park Commission that basketball be banned at the 
park until the council acts on a proposal to hire park rangers to control 
abusive language and noise. The recommendation passed on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended that the city hire a consultant to find another 
site in the park for the courts, which sit near the corner of Culver Boulevard 
and Coombs Avenue, about 100 feet from neighboring houses. 
</P>
<P>
If the council agrees with the recommendation, it would be the second time 
since 1982 that basketball has been banned from a Culver City park because of 
neighbors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The major problem is the fact that the courts are located too close to the 
residences," said neighbors Linda and Tom Buday, who moved into their house on 
Coombs Avenue in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators double-park in front of their driveway, players play their stereos 
too loud and "the language that filters over is just atrocious," Linda Buday 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring park rangers will not solve the problem, Tom Buday said. "If (a ranger) 
is standing at the basketball courts and someone's yelling, he's not going to 
be able to stop him. It isn't a manageable problem because that's part of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Their neighbor, Tracy Thomas, agreed that the courts need to be moved, saying 
that although building the courts near the houses may have been fine in the 
1940s, "it's an inappropriate location for the '90s for the way people act and 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Human Services Director Syd Kronenthal said the basketball courts in Culver 
City parks were deliberately placed near houses so they could be monitored by 
neighbors and would not be taken over by drug pushers, abusers or other 
anti-social elements. 
</P>
<P>
He said that park rangers, who would have the authority to carry arms and 
arrest people, could properly control the noise and foul language. 
</P>
<P>
Moving the courts, however, would be almost out of the question, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where would they go?" he asked, saying that there is no place to relocate them 
without displacing another facility such as a softball field, tennis courts or 
a children's play area. Because of the precedent set by the 1982 decision to 
close the basketball courts at Fox Hills Park, which was prompted by similar 
neighborhood complaints, the prospect of losing the courts altogether worries 
Kronenthal. 
</P>
<P>
As condominiums and apartments are built and open space dwindles, he said, the 
city should be doing everything it can to preserve and increase its recreation 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid if we retract any of (the facilities), we're going to end up with 
greater social problems," he said. "I contend that I would much rather hear the 
noise of basketball courts than no noise and the next thing you hear is the 
sound of car stereos (being ripped) out." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City resident Tom Wright, 40, a regular basketball player at the park, 
echoed Kronenthal's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have a park area like this so that young men can run off some 
steam," he said. "If they can't burn off their energy here, they'll burn it off 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Another regular player, Culver City resident Arnold Rodriguez said he doesn't 
think the neighbors have reason to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"If they buy a property here, near a park, they should know what they're 
getting into," said Rodriguez, 32. "We pay our taxes, we deserve a place to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Kronenthal said the 1982 closing of the basketball courts at Fox Hills Park may 
have contributed to the woes of residents near Veterans Park, because players 
from the densely populated Fox Hills area were forced to drive elsewhere to 
play ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies we have taken show that a good portion of the basketball players (at 
Veterans Park) are from Fox Hills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Human Services and Parks Commissioner David Hauptman, who voted against the ban 
on basketball at Veterans Park, said the basketball courts should be "kept open 
at any cost." 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we have a problem with some players, do we have to punish the 99% 
who are good?" said Hauptman, who was joined by Commissioner Patricia Hadley in 
dissent. "Today's kids need every form of positive recreation that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors say they are not against basketball, just the problems the 
crowded courts are attracting. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be that we're wrong and what we live through is something that should 
be expected for someone living next to a park," said Tom Buday. "But we don't 
think so."

FOOD COALITION FALLS ON HARD TIMES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: A PROGRAM TO FEED THE NEEDY THAT WAS OUSTED FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD IS 
NOW DRAWING POLICE AND HEALTH CITATIONS IN HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, which two months ago was ousted from 
West Hollywood's Plummer Park, is again fighting for its survival. 
</P>
<P>
The nightly feeding program for the homeless moved across the city border to 
Hollywood in order to continue its operation, but there too it has run into 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the group has been issued citations from the police and 
threatened with closure by the county Department of Health Services for 
operating without a permit after both agencies received complaints about the 
program from a movie supply company. The program operates in front of the 
company's building at Sycamore Avenue and Romaine Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same thing all over again," said Ted Landreth, a spokesman for the 
coalition. "What we are faced with is an underlying hypocrisy. People pretend 
that they care about the have-nots when all they really care about is 
protecting their own material well-being." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition moved the program to the intersection of Sycamore and Romaine in 
March after it was ordered out of Plummer Park by the West Hollywood City 
Council following neighborhood complaints that the feeding program was causing 
sanitation problems and attracting criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The new site was selected because it is in an industrial area away from homes 
and is only a mile from the park where it had operated for two years. The group 
bought a truck with donated funds, began using the kitchen at nearby Bethel 
Lutheran Church and resumed its nightly feeding operation. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few weeks, the program was operating at full strength, feeding roughly 
150 people a night with food brought in by truck and distributed to the 
homeless who would eat in a parking lot on the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was going well; our numbers were back up, and then suddenly all 
hell broke loose," said Maggie Preston Brammall, a coalition volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The same complaints that the group received from residents in West Hollywood 
began to haunt the program at the new location. 
</P>
<P>
Mole-Richardson Co., a movie supply company that owns the building and parking 
lot on the intersection of Romaine and Sycamore, complained to the police that 
the program was causing litter and attracting undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
Police began making visits to the feeding line, warning operators that there 
had been complaints about the program. And May 16, six police officers and a 
county health inspector showed up at the site. The group was issued two 
citations, one for parking in a red zone, another for distributing food within 
100 feet of an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"The police told us they would continue to harass us until we moved," Brammall 
said. "They told us they knew plenty of laws they could use against us." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rick Dinse of the Hollywood Division denied that his officers were 
harassing the program. He said the citations were issued after several 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, police have "received numerous complaints from a 
businessman in the area that the program is drawing transients into the 
community who are loitering around, intimidating clients, and urinating and 
defecating on his property." 
</P>
<P>
A Mole-Richardson spokesman would not comment on the matter other than to say 
that the company is trying to work out a solution with the feeding program. 
</P>
<P>
Dinse met with representatives from Mole-Richardson and the coalition in his 
office May 18. Dinse said he told coalition members that they could continue 
distributing food near the intersection as long as the feeding operation is 
restricted to the public sidewalk and the group does not break any laws, such 
as littering and trespassing on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they may not be considered a good neighbor, they may continue to 
operate there as long as they don't break any laws," he said, adding that his 
officers will continue to monitor the group's operation. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the complaints, coalition volunteers have stepped up efforts to 
make sure that the area is cleaned and that their clients do not loiter in the 
neighborhood after the meals are served. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members have also been under the scrutiny of the county Department of 
Health Services, which has said the program is operating without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials inspected the group's kitchen and its food truck and listed 
three pages of violations that must be addressed before a permit is issued. 
Most of the problems were considered minor, but some of the more expensive 
items included removing the linoleum floors and replacing refrigerators with 
professional models. 
</P>
<P>
LeTaun J. Cole-Burke, chief environmental health specialist for the county, 
said the county is not trying to put the group out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is not to put anyone out of business," she said. "We are working with 
them to help them improve their operation so there is less likelihood that the 
food will be contaminated. We don't want the homeless to become sick either. 
Let's take some preventive measures." 
</P>
<P>
The permit requirement by health officials caught coalition members off guard 
because they had operated the volunteer program in West Hollywood without a 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of the requirements would place a financial burden on the group, 
coalition members have asked the county to relax some of the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"If they start pressing us on concrete floors and professional refrigerators, 
we are out of business," Brammall said. "We couldn't possibly create a concrete 
floor in a church we don't own." 
</P>
<P>
She said the group is short of money since West Hollywood cut off its funding 
and evicted it from Plummer Park. It has also had to scramble to find adequate 
donors to cover its food distribution. It lost a major food donor when Drexel 
Burnham Lambert declared bankruptcy. In many ways, she said, the coalition is 
like the people it serves. 
</P>
<P>
"We are desperately short of money. It is almost laughable how little money we 
have to operate," she said. "Every day is a struggle. The problem is that a lot 
of people think we don't have a homeless problem, that the homeless are people 
who are lazy and don't want to work. Then there are those who care, but they 
just don't want to look at the people in our line."

ELECTIONS SCHOOL TAX; 
</P>
<P>
BACKERS OF PARCEL LEVY PUSH HARD IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
In its effort to persuade Beverly Hills residents to vote to tax themselves on 
behalf of the schools, the Yes on Schools Committee has made 4,000 phone calls, 
sent 16,000 flyers and letters, posted 1,500 lawn signs, and held star-studded 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
The group also hired a professional consultant, raised more than $126,000 and 
garnered the support of the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce and the 
city's Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The test of whether those tactics pay off comes in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tax must be approved by two-thirds of the voters to take effect. 
It would be levied on each residential and commercial parcel of land in the 
city for five years. Plots would be assessed $250 to $750 annually, depending 
on size and use, to raise about $4.5 million a year for the Beverly Hills 
Unified School District. If the tax fails, district officials say, 48 teachers, 
counselors, librarians and nurses will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, six volunteers and two paid staffers were stuffing 
envelopes, entering addresses into a computer, answering the five phones, and 
logging incoming checks in the Yes on Schools headquarters, a storefront office 
nestled among clothing boutiques and optical shops in the business section of 
Bedford Drive. On the walls are the likenesses of Big Bird, Dumbo and rainbows 
-- left over from when the site was used as a toddler's gymnasium -- along with 
giant butcher-paper "GOTV" (get out the vote) volunteer sign-up lists. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-tax movement boasts more than 300 volunteers, about 100 of whom are 
teachers, according to Kim Karie, senior vice president of Marathon 
Communications Inc., which Yes on Schools has hired as its campaign consultant. 
Thirty students help out regularly, including five high school students who are 
getting academic credit for their work. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has done the traditional phoning, coffee hours and door-to-door 
canvassing with glossy pamphlets. But it has also engineered rallies with 
television stars and a parade through the business district. 
</P>
<P>
According to financial reports filed last week, campaign contributions have 
come from homemakers, real estate investors, banks and school board members, 
most of it in sums of $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Donors include Mayor Allan Alexander, the Beverly Hills Firemens Assn., the 
Beverly Hills Hotel, designer Fred Hayman, the campaigns of Assemblymen Burt 
Margolin (D-Los Angeles) and Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), who are up for 
reelection, and Pia Zadora's husband, developer Meshulam Riklis. Developer and 
philanthropist George Konheim and Metropolitan Theaters President Bruce Corwin 
have each thrown in $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers union, the Beverly Hills Education Assn., has contributed $4,000, 
and its parent organization, the California Teachers Assn., has given $8,000. 
Restaurants and other companies have donated campaign T-shirts and food and 
carnival rides for the rallies. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has spent $85,300, with $16,500 going to Karie's firm in the last 
two months. Karie, whose expertise is field organization, has worked on races 
for the Beverly Hills City Council and school board. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the payroll are two full-time staffers, Cheryl Richardson, who has 
worked for candidates in Santa Monica and Orange County, and Marty Nislick, 
former executive director of the Maple Center, a nonprofit community counseling 
office in Beverly Hills. Nislick, a product of the Beverly Hills schools, said 
he will be paid about $13,000 for his three months of work. 
</P>
<P>
The committee spent about $5,000 for the 1,500 lawn signs and 200 window signs, 
Karie said. In the last two months, $21,000 was spent on campaign or 
fund-raising literature and $2,750 on postage. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of postage, the cost of paper, has gone up, the cost of surviving 
politically has gone up," Karie said. "I don't think it's a high budget. 
(Costly campaigns are) all over." 
</P>
<P>
Yes on Schools is not bashful about vastly outspending the tax opponents, whose 
campaign is running on photocopies of hand-lettered flyers, $400, and 50 to 100 
volunteers, anti-tax leader Sherman Kulick said. 
</P>
<P>
Kulick said he was also relying on the media, cable television airings of an 
election debate and voter pamphlet arguments to broadcast his tax-revolt and 
back-to-basics in education message. He charges that the district spends beyond 
its means and keeps unnecessary frills, such as drama and computer classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're cost-effective, we're trying to symbolize what we stand for," he said of 
his group, the Beverly Hills Citizens for Cost-Effective Quality Education. 
"Not only does money not buy education . . . money does not buy an election. 
It's mind-boggling how much money is involved here, in this little, local 
election." 
</P>
<P>
But Bernard Nebenzahl, co-chairman of Yes on Schools, argued: "We have to do 
everything possible we can. The consequences are too great to take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Those consequences of the tax's failure would be the layoffs of 48 teachers, 
counselors, librarians and nurses and 35 full-time teacher assistants, clerical 
and technical slots, according to the school district. Among the casualties 
would be the Academic Decathlon coach, all elementary school music teachers and 
computer specialists, and the high school planetarium. Teachers would lose a 3% 
pay increase, which was part of a strike settlement last fall and which was 
made contingent upon the parcel tax's success. 
</P>
<P>
"We are forced to spend that money because people don't turn out to vote," 
Karie added. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last time the Beverly Hills school district held a parcel tax 
election, 59% of the voters favored the tax, short of the two-thirds needed. 
Voter turnout was 25%, or about 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Too many of the registered voters failed to go to the polls, said Anneli Roth, 
a chairwoman of the 1987 pro-tax effort who is also working on the current 
campaign. "I'm embarrassed and ashamed to say that some were part of our 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know how to reach citizens, or instill in them an urgency," she 
said. Many of the tax supporters figured, "It was like motherhood and apple 
pie: Of course people were going to support our schools." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the current organization, the 1987 campaign had fewer volunteers 
and spent about $65,000, Roth said. Run out of co-Chairwoman Judie Fenton's 
home and without a professional consultant, it lacked sophistication, she said. 
"Everything, everything, was done . . . by amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
This time, tax advocates started their planning with an exploratory phone 
survey in January. The $9,000 survey, conducted by an independent consulting 
firm, found that a variable-rate tax was favored, while a flat-fee on every 
parcel -- which the 1987 tax proposed -- was seen as unfair, Nebenzahl said. 
More than 60% of the 400 randomly sampled registered voters supported a tax for 
the schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 different mailers have followed, sent to select audiences, such as 
tenants, parents, senior citizens. Co-Chairmen Nebenzahl and Sooky Goldman, who 
are civic activists, asked community leaders to give money and "play your 
part." A letter signed by several Beverly Hills High School graduates cajoles 
other alumni with lines from their alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
An army of 200 block captains was unleashed on the neighborhoods, knocking on 
doors and identifying the position of each household on the parcel tax, Karie 
said. Pairs of teachers and students have visited the undecided voters.

The committee has tried to phone residents who were missed on the walks to 
identify their stands and to answer any questions. If people say they plan to 
vote no on the tax, "We try to engage them in dialogue -- to see if there was a 
misunderstanding that can be cleared up," Karie said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether by phone or by visits, the campaign has contacted two-thirds to 
three-quarters of the estimated 16,000 households in Beverly Hills, Karie 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Both the tax proponents and opponents plan massive door-to-door campaign and 
phoning this weekend.

Julia Joseph, a 1973 graduate of Beverly Hills High School who was folding 
letters in the Yes on Schools office recently, said she was volunteering 
because its failure is "depressing and frightening." Joseph, whose oldest 
daughter will enter kindergarten in September, said she "bought into this 
district at incredible financial sacrifice" so that her children could attend 
the schools. Without the tax, she said, the quality of education that drew her 
to the city could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
But, Karie acknowledged, "two-thirds is a hard number to reach."

<P>
City Council candidate Doug Drummond boasts in nearly all of his campaign 
literature that he holds a doctorate in criminology that would help him solve 
this city's epidemic of crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Drummond's degree is from a university that is 3 years old, has never been 
accredited and operates out of three suites in an office building in Orange, 
according to school officials and two other educators. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond was the first student to earn a doctorate from August Vollmer 
University, and only one other doctorate has been awarded since, according to 
John P. Kenney, a former USC professor who founded the school in 1987. 
Criminologist Arnold Binder questioned the validity of such a degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Students earn a doctorate to teach at a university or to do research at major 
institutions. Would a degree from August Vollmer qualify for those positions? 
The fair assessment is it would not qualify for any of them," said Binder, who 
earned his doctorate at Stanford and is head of the department of criminology, 
law and society at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The degree has become the latest issue in a sometimes-vicious campaign that 
pits Drummond against Planning Commission Chairman Jim Serles for the 3rd City 
Council District seat being vacated by Jan Hall. The district takes in Belmont 
Shore, the Peninsula and Naples communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Never heard of August Vollmer U? Don't worry, you won't be seeing them at the 
Rose Bowl anytime soon," the latest Serles campaign flyer quips. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, 53, a retired police commander who forced a heavily favored Serles to 
a June 5 runoff, defended the integrity of the degree he earned in 1988, one 
year after the university opened in an Orange County office complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly a degree from Harvard holds more status than one from UC Irvine, and 
a degree from UC Irvine holds more status than one from August Vollmer," 
Drummond said. "I hope that over time . . . August Vollmer will become a very 
highly respected institution. . . . I am intensely proud of my (work) there." 
</P>
<P>
But two criminology professors said in interviews that a doctorate from Vollmer 
would not be accepted for a teaching or lecturing position at any University of 
California campus. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond is a part-time lecturer at Cal State Long Beach, but his master's 
degree from that university is sufficient for that post, a school official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of respect for Jack Kenney as an individual, but not for 
August Vollmer University," Binder said. "What they call a doctorate is not 
what we at other universities call a doctorate." 
</P>
<P>
Kenney taught public administration courses at USC for 13 years and criminology 
courses at Cal State Long Beach for 23 years. He is a former president of the 
Los Angeles Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
August Vollmer University, named for the renowned criminologist and Berkeley's 
chief of police in 1905, has an enrollment of 80 students in its bachelor's, 
master's and doctorate programs. Total tuition for the two-year doctorate in 
criminology is about $7,000 and requires 50 units of course work, 20 of which 
are earned from writing a doctoral project, Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's about the number of units our students complete in the first year," 
Binder said of the four-year doctoral program at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Doctoral dissertations are supposed to be a scholarly contribution of original 
research that adds to the body of knowledge within a particular field that is 
then entered, if approved by an academic committee, into research literature, 
Binder said. 
</P>
<P>
In criminology, dissertations often involve years of research, a review of 
hundreds of criminal cases, scores of interviews with judges, prosecutors and 
victims, and a dozen or more revisions of the finished work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond's 137-page body of work draws heavily from his 29 years as a Long 
Beach police officer. In a section titled "Being a Police Officer: 
Satisfactions," he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The excitement is endless. Newsworthy events are continuously occurring. . . . 
These include: critical injuries and deaths, spectacular crimes and arrests, 
high-speed automobile pursuits, officer-involved shootings, riots, bar brawls 
to break up, other serious fights, court cases, bloody automobile accidents and 
. . . ALL the bizarre behavior that can be found on the fringes of society. 
There are seldom dull moments." 
</P>
<P>
The project cites five interviews conducted as far back as 1973, including one 
of Kenney, one with a Long Beach police commander and one with a professor of 
criminal justice at Vollmer. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney said he would match his college's degree against any from UC Irvine or 
USC, where he once taught. He added that he has not applied for accreditation 
with the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges in Oakland because the school 
has not been in business long enough. 
</P>
<P>
But a representative of the accrediting commission said the university has yet 
to request even eligibility for accreditation, which then takes four to six 
years to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond said he began his doctoral work years ago at USC but failed to finish 
it within the required deadline. He switched to Vollmer out of his "tremendous 
respect" for Kenney, who said he founded the university to fill a void in 
criminology graduate programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The school is his dream," Drummond said. 
</P>

2 YEARS OF STUDENTS' TOIL PAYS OFF IN PHOTO BOOK ON HISTORIC HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During the past two decades, Hoover High School students have come to expect 
exotic assignments from art and photography teacher Pierre Odier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Odier took a class to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. A class in 1976 
journeyed to Africa and published a book about its experience. A group of 
students in 1980 spent two weeks at the former island prison on Alcatraz and 
documented the trip with a book. Other students have traveled with Odier to 
photograph New York City, San Francisco and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Odier's students stayed home to complete an assignment and, 
rather than focus on the present, cast a photographic eye on the past. 
</P>
<P>
The result -- just off the presses this week -- is a book of photographs about 
the historic Lanterman house in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We had more public pressure to perform here" than in foreign settings, said 
Odier, a Switzerland-born photographer who came to Hoover in 1966. "But it felt 
a little safer." 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 copies of the "The Lanterman House -- A California Saga" will be 
printed, with an option for publication of 5,000 more. A batch will be given to 
an organization that is converting the Lanterman house into a museum and to the 
La Canada Historical Society, which donated $2,000 to the project. The rest 
most likely will be sold to cover the remaining $2,000 in costs, Odier said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good idea," said Russ Campbell, historical society president. "We were 
going to make our own pamphlet for the museum, but having a nice, glossy book 
is always better." 
</P>
<P>
The students, mainly recruited through Odier's photography and art classes, 
paid several visits to the house, a 1915 Craftsman-style structure at 4420 
Encinas Drive. They talked to its caretaker, Gene Burrows, and local 
historians. They dug through literature provided by local and state archives 
and searched the Lantermans' personal files for information. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was just doing some editing and running a few captions," said 
Isabel Poole, a senior who did much of the research and writing for the 
56-page, soft-cover book. "I thought it would be easy and fun. But it was much 
harder work than I actually envisioned." 
</P>
<P>
The assignments were not always invigorating and the lessons not always 
exciting, some of the students said. "The historical research for me was really 
boring although the historical gossip was fun," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
But documenting the house was not a lesson in history, Odier said. Like his 
more exotic escapades, it was meant as a lesson in self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"My payback to these students is 'You did this. Be proud,' " Odier said. "I 
don't have time to change them. What I have time for is to give them an 
opportunity to do something." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 Hoover students had a role in creating the publication, a nearly 
two-year venture that sprang from a Hoover High Philosophy Club discussion 
about local politics, Odier said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lanterman house became the property of La Canada Flintridge in 1985 after 
the death of Lloyd Lanterman, the last surviving member of La Canada's pioneer 
family. Lanterman willed the vintage house to the city. 
</P>
<P>
After city officials announced plans to convert the 1.35 acre property into a 
museum and cultural center, neighbors filed a lawsuit in April, 1989, 
complaining that the conversion would add noise and traffic to the area. A Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge in October ruled against the neighbors, and last 
month the City Council approved a five-year operating agreement with the 
Lanterman Foundation, clearing the way for the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Hoover's philosophy and photo clubs became interested in the 
controversy before the lawsuit was filed and welcomed Odier's proposal to 
publish a book on the house, students said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know exactly what it was," said Pam Gillis, a senior. "Mr. Odier said 
it was a house in La Canada that they were going to turn into a museum. When I 
saw it, though, I thought it was amazing. I liked the ballroom." 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw it, my first impression was, 'What's the big deal?' " 
Poole said. "Then a historian started telling me about how the Lantermans 
shaped the area, and I started learning about the design of the house and its 
rooms. And then it seemed like what I was doing wasn't just a project in 
school. It seemed to have a lot more impact." 
</P>
<P>
Odier and a few students attended several La Canada Flintridge City Council 
meetings in support of the restoration, Odier said. But most of their time was 
spent poring over research, photographing the sizable house and searching for 
ways to finance the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs and narrative illustrate the details of the house's five 
bedrooms, living and dining rooms, ballroom and classic 1926 Crawford Special 
theater organ, one of four in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoover High book shows everything from the large organ to detailed shower 
heads, from whole living rooms and bedrooms to old silk bodices preserved in 
the house. One photograph of the house's interior shows in detail a hanging 
apron, which belonged to Frank and Lloyd Lanterman's mother and has not been 
moved since her death in 1949, Odier said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to go for what we felt were significant details," he said. "We opened 
up Mrs. Lanterman's old recipe box and found her reading glasses inside. We 
capitalized on pictures like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Lanterman house is not the first historic structure Odier and his students 
have documented. A 1977 class published a book on the Lummis house, the home of 
Charles F. Lummis, founder of the Southwest Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The Lanterman project also is not the only publication produced this year by 
Hoover High students. They also published the annual Photo Book, a collection 
of students' art and photo works. That book, according to Odier, is financed by 
ads and student fund-raising projects, such as the recycling of aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of students is considering documenting Randsburg, an old mining 
ghost town north of Lancaster in the Mojave Desert, Odier said, feigning a sigh 
at the prospect of another two-year venture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to keep kids committed over long periods of time," he said. 
"Some of the tedious, unglamorous work is becoming increasingly harder to 
accomplish. But I pump the kids full of stuff and hopefully something remains. 
I want them to think, conclude and come to their own terms." 
</P>
<P>
Odier will continue to initiate unconventional projects for his students, 
carrying them out despite a system that often bogs teachers down in 
bureaucratic rules. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my philosophy," he said. "It's easier to ask for forgiveness than for 
permission, you know, and I have a pretty good batting average."

<P>
Older people can get free information about housing through a new Westside 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Consumer Housing Information Service for Seniors, or CHISS, the 
program sends trained volunteers to visit with older people who request help 
with housing questions. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesperson, volunteers are trained to provide accurate, 
unbiased information on local housing options for homeowners and renters, 
including information on home repair programs and help with decisions on 
whether to move or stay in their present homes. 
</P>
<P>
The program is co-sponsored by WISE Senior Services, the Area Agency on Aging 
of Los Angeles County and the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>

$6.8 MILLION FROM STATE TO BUY NEW SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lynwood School District moved a step closer to building a high school for 
the overcrowded system recently when the state approved $6.8 million for the 
purchase of 12 acres of property. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to complete the purchase of the property on Imperial 
Highway owned by the Sterik Co. of West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The total state-funded price of the land was $24.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The district had been in court with the company since 1986 in an attempt to 
settle on a price. In April, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided the 
value of the land. 
</P>
<P>
The district has not yet reached a settlement on about 25 acres of land 
adjacent to the Sterik property. The land is owned by the Seventh-day Adventist 
Church, which has a school on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The district is scheduled to go to trial in August on the remaining land. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which has nearly 15,000 students, has been attempting to build a 
modern facility to replace its aging and overcrowded high school since 1983.

<P>
WILLIAM RUDELL TO BE INTERIM CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William B. Rudell, who was hired last month as a special legal counsel, has 
been named interim city attorney for the city of South Gate. Rudell, 50, was 
unanimously appointed Tuesday by the City Council to replace Bruce Boogaard, 
who resigned May 25 to become chief attorney for the city of Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The new city attorney is a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Richards, Watson 
&amp; Gershon. He will be paid $145 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Rudell will work on an interim basis for four to six months to evaluate the 
legal needs of the city before a final decision is made on the position, Mayor 
Robert A. Philipp said. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the law firm, Rudell was the city attorney for Burbank for three 
years. He was also on the Burbank City Council from 1973 to 1977. He was mayor 
of Burbank from 1975 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He has a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Yale

<P>
FUND-RAISER FOR SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rita Coolidge, Monty Hall and Ally Sheedy are expected to be among the guests 
at a fund-raiser to support the West Hollywood Homeless Organization at the 
Schindler House at 835 Kings Road from 6 to 8 p.m. June 7. 
</P>
<P>
The West Hollywood Homeless Organization, a nonprofit organization partially 
funded by the city, will be opening a 70-bed shelter for the homeless this 
summer at 1033 N. La Brea Ave. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to housing, the shelter will provide health services, job training, 
and counseling in AIDS awareness and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raiser is expected to draw some protests from a neighborhood group 
that is opposed to the shelter. Members of the Eastend Community Action, a 
neighborhood organization on West Hollywood's east side, are planning to picket 
the fund-raiser because, they say, it will attract undesirables.

TEACHERS PLAN TO FIGHT NEW RULES ON ABSENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers in the Compton schools said they will mount a legal fight against a 
resolution passed by the school board Tuesday night requiring employees to 
provide written proof of the need for any absences. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution is an attempt by the board to thwart incidents of the so-called 
blue flu, the one-day "sick-ins" that teachers have staged since March to 
protest stalled contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the board cannot pass measures on topics that are covered by 
the contract, said Wiley Jones, executive director of the Compton Education 
Assn., which represents the district's approximately 1,000 teachers. The 
contract, Jones said, does not require teachers to bring written proof for 
one-day absences. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the resolution, which was 4-2, came after the board went behind 
closed doors for more than three hours. Board members Kelvin D. Filer and Lynn 
Dymally Lee voted against it. Trustee John Steward was absent.

ANOTHER BOTTLENECK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent revelation in your newspaper that Glendale City Council members are 
considering refurbishing Maryland Avenue, from Broadway to Harvard in the same 
style as was done from Wilson to Broadway is another low blow for Glendale 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Aulden Schlatter recently wrote that Maryland in that area is the most 
expensive street in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Aulden was being very conservative. That portion of Maryland is probably the 
most expensive street in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Another taxpayer was recently quoted as saying the council gets an expensive 
traffic survey nearly every two years and then proceeds to ignore it. 
Obviously, no traffic engineer ever suggested the traffic bottleneck that was 
created when Maryland was redecorated. Another traffic bottleneck in Glendale 
is exactly what we don't need. 
</P>
<P>
A very reliable source was quoted saying it cost as much to redecorate Maryland 
from Wilson to Broadway as it cost to redecorate and widen Central Avenue from 
Lexington to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Maryland extremely expensive to install, but it will be expensive 
to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Is it true that Brand Boulevard is to be widened in certain areas only a few 
years after it was completely renovated at a great expense? 
</P>
<P>
All taxpayers know that the Council made a terrible and expensive mistake when 
they redecorated Maryland and they hope the Council won't make the same mistake 
twice. Why they did it the first time is anyone's guess.

OFFICIALS HONOR ELDERLY RESIDENTS FOR THEIR LONGEVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As they walked arm-in-arm through the Glendale Civic Auditorium last week, 
Virginia Young looked lovingly at her 95-year-old father and explained the 
secret of his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
"His caring is still for other people," said Young, 60. "I'm pretty proud of 
him for that." 
</P>
<P>
But her father, the Rev. Clarance Henry Parlour, offered a different theory. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret of long living is don't die," Parlour said. "Simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Parlour and nearly 100 other Glendale residents who apparently have mastered 
that secret were honored by city officials Thursday as "seniors of the 
century." All were born before 1910 and have lived in every decade of the 
1900s. Thirteen -- including Parlour -- were born in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The reception, the first of its kind, kicked off the second annual, daylong 
senior citizens fair, sponsored by the Glendale Parks and Recreation Department 
and the Greater Glendale Council on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 senior citizens attended the fair, collecting information from 
vendors and many of Glendale's 46 elderly advocate groups and investigating the 
latest in services, said Marian Anderson, a senior programs supervisor for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the "seniors of the century," many accompanied by their families, 
gathered on the auditorium's patio, ate pastries and received certificates and 
accolades from city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many out there who just sit around and wait for time to pass -- but 
not you," Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian told those who were honored Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Stuart Howard, a Glendale resident for 36 years, agreed. Howard, who 
will turn 84 next week, won a gold medal in the shot put and a bronze medal in 
horseshoe throwing at last year's World Senior Games, an annual Olympics-style 
event for the elderly that is held in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"He can hit a baseball farther than I can," said Paul Warme, Howard's 
18-year-old grandson, who attended the reception. 
</P>
<P>
One of Howard's four daughters in attendance proudly cited another 
accomplishment. "He's got seven kids, and all seven were raised in Glendale," 
said Deborah Cameron, 37. "He didn't have time to grow old." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the elderly citizens, the reception at the civic auditorium was 
especially memorable. Don Bourrette, a Glendale resident for 50 years who 
recently moved to Pasadena, was a painter who helped build the auditorium in 
1938. Bourrette, 83, later managed it for nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
For others, it was merely another activity in a busy schedule. Parlour, who 
retired from St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Glendale in 1962, still is active 
in church affairs and is preparing to give a blessing at a June wedding, his 
daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Brown, a Glendale resident since 1933, took time off from her volunteer 
work as a hostess at the Glendale Adult Recreation Center, which provides 
recreation for the elderly, to attend the reception with her husband, Charley. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns, married in 1972, were too young to be honored -- Elaine is 74, 
Charley is 72 -- but they clapped and cheered when their friends received 
accolades. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, they used to put the old folks in a room and bring them out 
only when they had company," Elaine Brown said. "Now look at all there is to 
do."

THERE WAS HIGH DRAMA IN SANTA FE HIGH'S 2-A SEMIFINAL SOFTBALL WIN OVER 
CABRILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa Shandy's precious right arm would take care of itself, but her left foot 
needed attention. Santa Fe High School's star pitcher looked down at her pink 
toenails as Coach David Crain stretched tape over a callus. 
</P>
<P>
A junior with a 23-1 record for a 24-1 team, Shandy did not seem nervous before 
Tuesday afternoon's Southern Section 2-A semifinal softball game against 
Cabrillo of Lompoc. But her mother, Vicki, was a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm going to throw up," said Vicki, who was pacing behind the 
backstop at Little Lake Park in Santa Fe Springs. Like her daughter, she wore a 
black-and-white Chiefs jersey. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Fe dugout, advice was being dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you decide to steal today, go fast," said Jennifer Jannak, who plays 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
"You know I'm a speedster," assured left fielder Jennifer Buttery. "I'm 
lightning on the bases." 
</P>
<P>
Buttery also had a message for her teammates: "Let's have a good attitude this 
game -- no mouthing off." 
</P>
<P>
She thought about that and added: "Someone will have to staple my mouth shut, 
or I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that the sport had come a long way since the polite Girls Athletic 
Assn. days when Vicki Shandy played. 
</P>
<P>
"Take her (the fielder) out, knock her on her nose," said John Reynolds, an 
assistant coach, instructing the team what to do when running the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, dump her," echoed an enthusiastic Chief. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe finished with a 24-4 record last season after losing to Notre Dame of 
Riverside in the CIF finals. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, with the arrival of freshman twins Randi and Laura Berg, the 
Chiefs have been almost unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Randi, a shortstop with a .396 batting average, and Laura, a catcher hitting 
.435, shared the league's most valuable player award. They have played softball 
since they were 5 and have excelled in national competition as members of a 
traveling team. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were coming up," Lisa Shandy said. "This is the team we've been 
waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
The twins helped to lead Santa Fe to its first Whitmont League title. The 
Chiefs were 14-0 in the league, beating archrival La Serna twice. A 1-0 loss to 
Cerritos is the only blemish on their overall record. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been blessed with an awesome team," said Crain, who teaches typing at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players, he said, have been together since they were on Bobby Sox 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the Chiefs were All-CIF selections last season: Shandy, Jannak, and 
designated hitter Carie Hanchett. 
</P>
<P>
The game was moments away as Crain gathered the team around him. "OK, ladies, 
good strong defense," he said. "This is just like another game against La 
Serna. We can beat this team. They're not invincible." 
</P>
<P>
Cabrillo's record was 21-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, grandparents, teachers and students, who packed a small grandstand, 
cheered as Shandy, using a windmill motion that sent her blond hair flying, 
struck out the first batter to start the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the next batter beat out a hit, causing Vicki Shandy, who also kept the 
official score book, to resume pacing. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, who has thrown 80% of her pitches for strikes this season, got 
through the first inning. But so did Cabrillo pitcher Karen McCormick after 
Santa Fe had threatened to score. 
</P>
<P>
Randi Berg ruled the dirt infield. She fielded grounder after grounder with a 
polished style, then rocketed the ball to first base. 
</P>
<P>
In the dugout, which smelled sweetly of gum, she said: "Gary's not here, and 
I'm doing perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Gary, a teammate explained, is the boy Randi likes. 
</P>
<P>
The game, tense and scoreless, held the crowd's attention. The candy bars and 
gum, displayed on a table by the Chiefs' boosters, were going unsold. 
</P>
<P>
A Cabrillo runner reached third with two outs in the fifth inning. But the next 
batter flied out, and the crowd breathed a collective sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk it up," implored Jannak as the Chiefs came in to bat. "You guys don't 
sound like you want it. Let's go. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the sixth, Laura Berg led off with a bunt single. 
</P>
<P>
Shandy then dribbled a sacrifice bunt. The ball was thrown wildly to first. 
Berg rounded second and took off for third. The throw there was wild too, 
enabling Laura to race home with the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Her twin then lined a single to score Shandy. 
</P>
<P>
Crain and the players huddled before the top of the seventh. "Defense!" they 
yelled. 
</P>
<P>
Shandy had put her hair up in a ponytail. "It makes me more intense," she would 
explain later. 
</P>
<P>
With her mother aiming a camera at her through the chain-link backstop, Shandy 
got two quick outs, then allowed a pop single. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over till the fat lady sings," someone in the crowd cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
A Cabrillo pinch-hitter swung at two of Shandy's best fastballs and missed. 
</P>
<P>
"You got two on her babe!" a fan yelled. 
</P>
<P>
She had three on her after the next pitch, another blur, and Santa Fe, a 2-0 
victor, had reached the CIF finals again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe will try to win the CIF 2-A title when it plays Hesperia of Riverside 
County at 6 p.m. Friday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.

ELECTIONS ASSEMBLY; 
</P>
<P>
A GUIDE TO ISSUES FACING CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT 41 RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overview 
</P>
<P>
In the 41st District, where Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) has long been 
invincible, Democrats Jeanette Mann and Rod C. McKenzie are dueling through a 
primary that could have a significant impact on the general election. 
Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district 78,805 to 64,745, and Nolan has 
raised over $100,000 more than his opponents, but he has been named as an 
unindicted target in an FBI investigation into legislative corruption. Nolan 
has twice had to deny rumors that he will resign. Mann has generated 
endorsements and contributions from a long list of liberal Democratic clubs and 
candidates, and stressed ethics and abortion rights in her campaign. McKenzie 
has run a low-key campaign, suggesting that he could likely draw crossover GOP 
voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
Contenders 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Mann, 53, of Pasadena is serving in her second term as a trustee of 
the Pasadena Community College District. She received her bachelor's degree in 
creative writing and her master's and doctoral degrees in English language and 
literature from the University of Missouri at Columbia. Currently, she is 
director of affirmative action programs at Cal State Northridge. Mann has 
received the endorsements of the California Democratic Party, California NOW 
and various labor organizations. She and her husband, Kenneth, a scientist at 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, have three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
Rod C. McKenzie, 52, of Altadena is a professor of geography at USC who 
specializes in environmental geography. A newcomer to politics, he said he 
entered the race because of incumbent Assemblyman Pat Nolan's strong 
anti-abortion stance. McKenzie received his bachelor's degree in history and 
his master's and doctoral degrees in geography from UCLA. He and his wife, 
Carol, a professor of recreation and leisure studies at Cal State Los Angeles, 
have a 13-year-old daughter, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Assemblyman Pat Nolan and David Velasquez, representing the Peace 
and Freedom party, are unopposed in their primaries. Their names will appear on 
the general election ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and 
were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised by 
a quarter-cent for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor 
an increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. I support the use of existing and proposed bonds to fund school 
construction; bonds are more appropriate for such long-lasting capital 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Given disproportionate harshness of sales taxes on poor families, 
some other tax base must be used to finance the necessary new construction. 
</P>
<P>
Q. An initiative measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales 
by 9 cents a gallon to finance highway projects. Do you support the concept of 
higher gas taxes to underwrite road construction? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes, because it funds mass transit and highway rehabilitation as well as 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District into smaller districts? 
</P>
<P>
 Mann: This is an issue best left to parents and voters in LAUSD. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under current law, the state Legislature is responsible for redrawing state 
legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system 
should be changed? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. Reapportionment is a political act; it is impossible to keep politics 
out of reapportionment. It is best left to the elected representatives of the 
people, who are accountable to the people: the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. Since the Legislature seems incapable of responsible 
redistricting, California voters have no other option than to establish a 
bipartisan commission. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would 
eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides 
known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new 
developments? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. Day care ought not to be required by the government. It should be 
provided by the government or supported by tax credits as one among many 
benefits, such as health care, made available to employees. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. Full subsidy, no. However, partial subsidy is appropriate in 
that it requires of employers some minimum philosophical acceptance of this 
responsibility. Cost would be minimal as it would be passed through to the 
consumer of the company's goods and/or services. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the state's efforts to build prisons in Lancaster and East 
Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Lancaster, yes. East Los Angeles, no. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts 
to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for 
higher legislative salaries. Do you support this ballot initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. It is critically important to pay legislators a reasonable salary; 
not to do so forces them to supplement their income with honorariums and phony 
consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. For a college professor such as I, the Assembly pay will not be 
sufficient to maintain two residences without honorariums. Higher salaries seem 
unrealistic in the present, especially given the electorate's distrust of 
"politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support Gov. Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that would 
require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to pay 
for their incarceration? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. As long as there is a demand, there will be a supply. We must 
convince our young people that drugs are death. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. More education in K-12, plus a surer sense of justice. Crowded 
courts combined with generous bail and early release hardly send a message of a 
resolute society. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law 
enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, by how much? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. I support the Van de Kamp drug initiative, which would provide for 
the use of bond money to support a planned, eight-year effort to eliminate 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. Public funding will free candidates from their obligations to 
special interest groups so that they can represent all the people -- not just 
those who contributed to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. I like the concept as long as third parties are eligible and as 
long as the public is supportive. However, since so few check off the optional 
$1 support on the Federal 1040, this proposal seems highly unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals 
and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. This is an extreme overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your 
spouse before the election? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. They are better than Sominex. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A development project called Porter Ranch would create 3,395 residential 
units and nearly 6 million square feet of commercial office space in the 
Chatsworth hills. Opponents say it is too big. Proponents say it represents 
orderly growth. Do you support the project at this size? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: This is a decision better left to the residents of the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limits on the number of terms state legislators can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, how long should they be? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. I support the Van de Kamp initiative which limits the terms of state 
legislators to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No. Too many legislators are already pretty "lame ducks" without 
making them truly fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of 
pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you 
support this measure? 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. I am opposed to spraying malathion in urban areas; however, this 
initiative would go too far and would prohibit any spraying even in medical 
emergencies such as the encephalitis epidemic in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie: No.

SANTA MONICA'S LIPSCOMB ENJOYS LIFE IN FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica High's Felice Lipscomb recorded the second-fastest time in the 
nation this season in the 300-meter low hurdles Friday night at the CIF 
Master's meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Lipscomb, the fastest time was set in the same race by 
defending state champion Twila Sims of Lompoc. Sims, a sophomore, came from 
behind in the final 10 meters to edge Lipscomb, 42.29 seconds to 42.30. The 
finish-line judge needed to review the film before declaring a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lipscomb easily won the 100-meter low hurdles in 13.97. Sims finished 
third with a 14.55. 
</P>
<P>
Both will attempt to improve their times Friday and Saturday at the State Track 
and Field Championships at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb, a USC-bound senior, is the defending state champion in the 100 
hurdles and hasn't been beaten in the race this season. She's lost only twice 
in the past three years. But her real challenge remains the 300 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Since Lipscomb began running track as a freshman four years ago, Santa Monica 
Coach Mike Griswold has been trying to persuade her to run the 300 hurdles. 
Lipscomb, who preferred the sprint races, refused to run the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have asked her 200 times," Griswold said. "But since Felice was 
enjoying such success in the shorter races, she didn't see the reasoning in 
adding the longer hurdle race. Running 300 meters meant more pain, and she 
wasn't interested in that." 
</P>
<P>
Finally in January on their way to a press conference for the Sunkist Indoor 
Invitational, Lipscomb gave in to her coach's plea and agreed to drop the 
100-meter dash for the 300 hurdles. Although Sims, 16, has beaten her three 
times in the event this season, Lipscomb, 18, has improved in each race and 
appears ready to unseat the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Sims easily defeated Lipscomb in the 300 hurdles in their first meeting at the 
Northridge Invitational two months ago, but barely beat her in their second 
race at the Arcadia Invitational in April. At the Master's meet, Lipscomb lead 
most of the race until Sims was able to overtake her on the final hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact the I'm finishing second to Twila after only one year of 
competing in this race is quite an accomplishment," Lipscomb said. "I'm looking 
at state as if I have nothing to lose. I'm not the defending champ (in 300 
hurdles), so the pressure isn't on me. I feel like I'm a contender, though, and 
hope that I can win the race." 
</P>
<P>
Griswold predicts a double victory for Lipscomb in the 100 and 300 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"Felice is the fastest hurdler in the state by far," he said. "How she finishes 
depends on how hard she wants to work." 
</P>
<P>
One thing favoring Lipscomb is her strong desire to compete. She started 
running track after being beaten in a race during a gym class in the eighth 
grade. When she had the opportunity to join Santa Monica's track team the 
following year, Lipscomb decided to go out for the squad. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Lipscomb won the 100 hurdles in the Bay League championships and 
qualified for the Southern Section 4-A Division meet. The next year, she won 
the event at the Southern Section and Master's meet and finished third at 
state. She defended her titles as a junior and won the race at state. 
</P>
<P>
She is a favorite to repeat her title in the event. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Lipscomb's success in the 100 hurdles, Griswold feels her future 
remains in the longer hurdle race. He said she could become the best woman 
400-meter hurdler in the nation in college. 
</P>
<P>
"Felice has a very long stride for a sprinter," Griswold said. "And she is 
extremely quick. If she works hard enough, she could become the first woman 
college hurdler to run 13 steps between each hurdle. She's just got the natural 
stride." 
</P>
<P>
In the 300 hurdles, Lipscomb runs 14 steps between the first two hurdles and 
increases it to 15 steps the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I didn't run the 300 hurdles earlier is because I didn't want to 
concentrate on marking my step," Lipscomb said. "It takes a lot of 
concentration. In the 100 hurdles, my stride is all natural. But I'm glad I 
decided to add the race. I honestly didn't think I'd do as well as I have." 
</P>
<P>
Sims didn't run the 300 hurdles until the middle of last season, but at 
5-foot-9 she has the natural size and speed for the event. Lipscomb, at 5-6, 
compensates for her size with quickness. 
</P>
<P>
At the Master's meet, Lipscomb jumped out to an early lead in the 300 hurdles 
and lead Sims by several meters midway through the race. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to beat Twila at state, I'm going to have to jump out to an early 
lead again and then push it harder over the last few hurdles," Lipscomb said. 
"Twila has more endurance, but I have more speed. So, I've got to take 
advantage of that. I was a little upset by (Friday's) loss, but I'm ready to 
make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Venice distance runner Danny Jordan is suffering from tendinitis in his right 
foot and failed to defend his City Section title in the 1,600 meters. Jordan, 
whose best time this season is 4:10.8, finished second at the City finals with 
a 4:20.38.

BRUIN WOMEN AMONG FAVORITES FOR NATIONAL CREW CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's and women's crews will compete in national championships. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kelly Salonites and her women's eight, who have lost only to top-ranked 
Princeton this season, are among the favorites in the national regatta Saturday 
and Sunday at Lake Wingra in Madison, Wis. The Bruins were ranked second in the 
nation for most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Princeton, other strong crews include Wisconsin and defending 
national champion Cornell. In winning last year's nationals, Cornell ended 
Washington's streak of seven consecutive national titles. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin women received an automatic berth and an expenses-paid trip to the 
nationals after they won the Pacific Coast Championship, ending Washington's 
10-year reign as champion. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Zenon Babraj and his UCLA men's varsity plan to compete as an at-large 
crew in the national regatta June 17 in Cincinnati. The Bruins, who had won 
three consecutive Pacific Coast Championships, failed to get an automatic bid 
to the nationals when they finished second to Washington at this year's Pacific 
Coast regatta. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin men, who will be going to the nationals for the fourth year in a row, 
are raising funds to finance their trip because only the Pacific Coast 
champion's way is paid by the organizers of the Cincinnati regatta. Donations 
can be sent to Friends of UCLA Rowing, c/o UCLA Men's Crew, Department of 
Intercollegiate Athletics, 405 Hilgard Ave., Los Angeles 90024-1639. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's softball team won its third consecutive NCAA women's College 
World Series, defeating Fresno State, 2-0, in the final. Freshman pitcher 
Heather Compton threw a one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who have won six of eight national titles, had five players named 
to the all-tournament team: pitcher Lisa Longaker, first baseman Kerry Dienelt, 
third baseman-pitcher Lisa Fernandez and outfielders Yvonne Gutierrez and 
Shanna Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine shortstop Chris Martin, Loyola Marymount outfielder Rick Mediavilla 
and UCLA catcher Paul Ellis were named to the NCAA Division I all-District 8 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis hit his 29th home run, the most by any Division I player as the week 
began, as the Bruins (41-26) were eliminated by Georgia Southern, 5-4, in the 
NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Other players selected to the all-District 8 second team included UCLA first 
baseman Chris Pritchett, Loyola Marymount catcher Miah Bradbury, UCLA 
outfielder Joel Wolfe, Loyola Marymount outfielder Tony Kounas, Pepperdine 
pitcher Britt Craven and Loyola Marymount relief pitcher Darryl Scott. 
</P>
<P>
East and West all-star baseball teams from the 3-A and 4-A divisions in the Los 
Angeles City-CIF Section will play Sunday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium at 
the Veterans Administration in West Los Angeles. The Santa Monica Optimist Club 
is sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-A game will be at noon and the 4-A game at 3 p.m. Admission to the 
double-header is $5 for persons 18 and older, $3 for high school students and 
$2 for children 11 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-man team will be selected from both levels to play all-star preps from 
Orange County at 7 p.m. June 18 at UC Irvine.

SPONSOR TABLES BORDER BONDING AUTHORITY BILL; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: MOVE COMES IN FACE OF OPPOSITION FROM SAN DIEGO REPRESENTATIVES 
WHO FEAR THE PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE COULD LEAD TO A KIND 
OF 'JUNK BOND' CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pounded by questions from legislators and opposition from San Diegans, a 
controversial measure to establish a border bonding authority was unexpectedly 
held over in a crucial Assembly Ways and Means Committee Wednesday for further 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before the committee was to take a final vote, Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) asked to have his border proposal tabled for a few 
weeks so he could reassure uneasy colleagues and try to win over San Diego 
representatives, who sharply attacked his bill Wednesday by likening it to the 
"junk bond" crisis that swept Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the votes, but I want to continue to work with the city and other 
opponents," Polanco told reporters after withdrawing his bill for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco's maneuver came after a sometimes emotional hearing on his proposal to 
form a nine-member California and Mexico Infrastructure Bonding Authority, 
which would be able to float revenue bonds and raise money to build roads, 
sewers, water pipes and other public improvements related primarily to the 
maquiladora industry south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
As they have for months, Polanco and his supporters on Wednesday argued that 
the proposed bonding authority was necessary to break a governmental deadlock 
over the problems now affecting the maquiladoras -- American and foreign plants 
built in Mexico to take advantage of low-cost labor. Local jurisdictions such 
as the City of San Diego, they say, have been unable to come up with the cash 
or diplomacy to adequately grapple with infrastructure problems now threatening 
the growth of the maquiladoras. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a first attempt to pay for the solutions that have been analyzed for 
years along the border," testified Sam Palmer IV, an Orange County financial 
consultant who came up with the original plan for the bonding authority more 
than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other financial experts, appearing on Polanco's behalf, also told 
committee members that stimulating the border economy in Mexico would not only 
enrich California businesses, but cut down on illegal immigrants and drug 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"The more value added on the Mexican side, the less Mexicans will be on this 
side," said Jose Garcia-Medrano, a vice president and senior economist for 
Merrill Lynch in New York. "The more flourishing, the more robust the economy, 
the less incentive there is for the underground (drug) economy." 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego representatives, long suspicious of Polanco's border proposal, 
continued to protest the bill. City of San Diego lobbyist Kathryn C. Rees said 
members of the local legislative delegation were opposed to the measure -- 
including Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego), who is listed on the Polanco 
bill as a co-author. 
</P>
<P>
Rees and Rudy G. Gonzales, a city economic development administrator, said the 
authority would be an unresponsive layer of government that would actually 
upset the fragile border economy by meddling in local planning decisions and 
imposing taxes on already financially overburdened border businesses and 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who can least afford these structural improvements would be the 
ones to pay," said Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
He also called attention to new amendments in the Polanco bill that would allow 
the authority, under certain circumstances, to waive public hearings and make 
unsecured loans to anyone who wants to build a border project. If the project 
goes belly-up, Gonzales said, the state may be held liable for paying back the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply remind you of the junk bond issue and Drexel Lambert at this time," 
Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
Those comments were geared toward Ways and Means Committee members already 
worried over the details of how such a border authority would back up and pay 
off its bonds. At one juncture, an impatient Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles) interrupted a Polanco witness to ask pointedly: "What kind of paper 
would it be? Someone's on the hook." 
</P>
<P>
Polanco said the bonds would be backed by the revenues -- taxes and tolls -- 
taken in by the projects themselves. While the authority could take over the 
projects and sell them off, it would be the bondholders' hard luck if a border 
project fell short of its revenue projections, Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no debt to the State of California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, committee chairman, also chided Polanco for submitting pages of 
amendments to his bill too late for a legislative consultant to read and 
analyze them in time for Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those misgivings, Roos made the motion to pass Polanco's bill out of 
the committee -- a motion that was left hanging when the Los Angeles legislator 
withdrew his bill. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Polanco called San Diego leaders "short-sighted" for 
fighting against his proposed authority. "Unless they can come up with another 
potential funding mechanism, they ought not to walk away from the table," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different, it's new, it has not been tried here and there are a lot of 
questions," Polanco said about his proposal. "I believe we have been responsive 
to those questions." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of Polanco's witnesses acknowledged that it is conceivable his 
firm could end up selling the revenue bonds for the authority, if it is created 
by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too early to say," said Garcia, the Merrill Lynch vice president. 
"Any investment house would have the possibility of selling them. If everything 
is properly presented, there would be a lot of people interested." 
</P>
<P>
He said the same would apply to Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., a representative of 
which also testified on behalf of Polanco's bill Wednesday.

AL MARTINEZ: FACES ON THE SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Al Martinez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend who lived in Hollywood tried to take his own life about three years 
ago and failed. That wasn't a big surprise to either of us because he was 
always lousy at planning things out. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie had taken an excessive number of prescription pills washed down with 
bourbon and it had made him violently ill. The reason it made him ill, we 
learned later, was because the pills contained disulfiram. 
</P>
<P>
Disulfiram is a medication used to treat alcoholics. When you take one and then 
drink booze, you vomit. Ideally, the reaction will cause you to give up 
alcohol. Either that, or you will spend the rest of your life drinking and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie's thinking when he took a handful of the pills was that he would simply 
float off to eternity and wake up feeling refreshed and burdenless in a place 
where all is forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, he ended up in the emergency ward of a county hospital, feeling sick 
and stupid, surrounded by overworked people who could treat him for his 
sickness but not his stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
I remembered Charlie yesterday as I watched a student videotape documentary 
called "A Journey Back" that dealt with a family's efforts to come to grips 
with a father's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The tape was made by one of the man's daughters and won an award given by the 
Anti-Defamation League of Los Angeles. It said something to me and it ought to 
say something to you. 
</P>
<P>
Life is short and laughter fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know why Charlie tried to end it all and, similarly, Louise Gallup 
never knew specifically why her father, Sam Gallup, shot himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
As Sam's life unfolds in film clips and photographs, we see a boy become a man 
in easy stages of progression. He earns a medical degree, marries and begins 
raising a family. 
</P>
<P>
He seems content with his lot, at ease with his surroundings. But is there 
something in the hesitant smile that suggests life will one day become 
unbearable? 
</P>
<P>
Is there anguish churning in the soul of the man as he stands by a tent in the 
rain, looking toward a distant forest? What does the forest hide? What does the 
smile conceal? 
</P>
<P>
Sam had been an Army medical officer during the wars in Korea and Vietnam. When 
he returned from Vietnam, he seemed distant and remote. 
</P>
<P>
One son in "A Journey Back" says it was "like someone had poured ice cubes in 
his heart." 
</P>
<P>
Sam was treated for depression and seemed to be improving. But then one day, a 
Thursday, he went out into a barn, pointed a gun at his chest and pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
The family was stunned. Why had Sam done that to himself? Why had he done it to 
them? He had been emerging from the gloom of depression. The ice cubes in his 
heart were melting. 
</P>
<P>
Then . . . bam! 
</P>
<P>
It was only later, Louise Gallup says in her narration, that they discovered 
why the burden seemed to be lifting from Sam in the days before his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
It was in his journal: "You need to release me. I'll always be a part of you, 
but I'm getting tired. I feel a strong, silent inner peace I've never felt 
before. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Louise says softly, "Dad had already made up his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie was embarrassed about his failed suicide attempt. I'm not sure what 
embarrassed him most, the attempt or the failure. That's not the kind of 
question you ask a guy who has just blown a trip to Kingdom Come. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, was I sick," he said when I visited him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The pills make you throw up when you drink," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that now," Charlie said. "They ought to sell them as suicide pills. You 
try it once with those things, you'll never want to try it again." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie was a writer. He reminded me of Oscar Levant, the iconoclastic pianist 
who spent his life in and out of mental institutions. Charlie even looked a 
little like Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Levant, who died in 1972, was funnier than hell and so was Charlie. The night 
Charlie took those pills, he had me laughing over a short story he was writing 
about a guy who fell in love with a seal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was those big, liquid eyes," I remember Charlie saying. "But he couldn't 
take the fish smell and the barking." 
</P>
<P>
Then Charlie sighed and said, "It'll never sell. What you write sells. What I 
write gets flushed." 
</P>
<P>
I thought about that later and wondered if I had been a reason for Charlie's 
suicide attempt. By succeeding, had I become the measure of his failure? 
</P>
<P>
Louise Gallup dealt with feelings of guilt by producing a movie that says Sam's 
death isn't the family's fault. It's a beautiful film, full of love and 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what happened to Charlie. He left town after the suicide attempt 
and I haven't heard from him since. I'll miss him. He made me laugh.

SUPERVISOR CANDIDATE SCHAEFER ORDERED JAILED FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT

Former San Diego City Councilman Michael Schaefer, a current candidate for the 
county Board of Supervisors, was jailed Wednesday by a San Diego federal judge 
for contempt of court connected to a multimillion-dollar state court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Rudi M. Brewster ordered Schaefer jailed indefinitely after 
finding that the millionaire slum landlord persisted in filing legal papers on 
appeals and settlement talks in the state court suit after he had been told to 
desist. In that suit, a jury awarded Los Angeles tenants of Schaefer's $1.83 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, a San Diego attorney, was led away immediately to the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge approved a 
settlement Wednesday in the state court suit under which the the tenants would 
receive $1.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, 52, is a candidate in the June 5 supervisorial primary for the 4th 
District seat held by Leon Williams. Willie Blair, a former aide to San Diego 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, is the third candidate in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer was a City Council member from 1965 to 1971. He has since lost more 
than a dozen races in San Diego and in two other states, including contests for 
mayor, city attorney, district attorney, judge, state Senate, Congress, State 
Board of Equalization, secretary of state in Nevada and the U.S. Senate in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury returned the $1.83-million verdict 
against him in a suit brought by former tenants in a Mid-Wilshire building. The 
jurors found that Schaefer had allowed the building, which he bought in 1977, 
to become overrun by 1981 with rats, cockroaches and violence. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants have yet to receive a penny of the money. However, Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Barnet M. Cooperman approved the $1.95-million settlement 
Wednesday, leaving only a June 5 hearing on the deal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
in San Diego, according to attorneys involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The case is in bankruptcy court because Schaefer filed for bankruptcy 
protection in July, 1987, to avoid or delay paying the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the bankruptcy, a trustee took over control of all of Schaefer's 
assets, resulting in his being excluded from involvement with further action -- 
appeals or settlement negotiations -- linked to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Brewster made it formal, issuing an order directing Schaefer to 
refrain from involvement with appeals or settlement talks without prior written 
permission from the bankruptcy trustee or Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schaefer filed briefs with four different courts -- two of which are 
still pending -- asking himself for help, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Saying Wednesday that Schaefer was "biting himself in the tail," Brewster 
ordered him jailed until the two pending briefs are withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer's attorney, Floyd Morrow, could not be reached Wednesday for comment.

MISANDROSY AND MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS' BATTLE TO BAR MEN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a male who has suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous feminism, I have 
some sympathy for the complaints of Arnold about the blatant misandrosy now 
raging in the land. 
</P>
<P>
However, Arnold's debating techniques do not inspire confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to the research cited by the Mills rebels he calls it 
"pseudo-research." He does not offer any rebuttal; he evidently thinks 
name-calling can pass for argument. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in attacking misandrosy, Arnold picks some mighty strange targets. Riane 
Eisler seems to me entirely free of misandrosy; indeed her book is dedicated to 
her husband, and her ideal "partnership society" is one of equality, unlike the 
matriarchies posited by the real man-haters in the feminist movement, such as 
Robin Morgan or Susan Brownmiller. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pity that Arnold has discredited his argument with these shoddy 
techniques because misandrosy is a real and dangerous trend. If anybody spoke 
of Jews, African Americans, Latinos, gays, or even foot-fetishists in the way 
many leading feminists speak of men in the major media he would be suspended, 
forced to apologize and perhaps successfully sued for libel. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the misandrosy of our time, nutty as it is, is a direct response 
to the misogyny spouted by the Christian clergy for 2000 years. Why does not 
the Rev. Arnold address that issue?

Arnold gives misogyny a bad name. His raving attack on the Mills students -- 
and all women -- is a good example of why Mills students want to keep their 
school the way it is -- distinct and independent. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that what they want at Mills is "their own space." It has nothing 
to do with man-hating or hating of anyone else. And if it did, that's their 
business! 
</P>
<P>
When I attended Cal Berkeley and visited friends at Mills, there never was any 
hatred evident. And Arnold complains of the notion that men are perceived to be 
"good (only) for making money." But Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Ronald Reagan 
and Charles Keating didn't come from Mills, did they, Father?

<P>
How dare we continue to ridicule and chastise someone who has so bravely and 
unselfishly stood against this barbarous and criminal form of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Californians must move beyond their emotional disgust and hate for capital 
offenders to the reason and logic that guides us to value all human life. 
</P>
<P>
Do I as a taxpayer wish to pay some astronomical sum to keep a murderer in 
prison for the rest of his/her life? No. But rather than be a murderer myself, 
I would like our prisons to be more self-sufficient. This, however will only 
happen if we first value the lives of those in prison. The death penalty issue 
continues to pinpoint in the most extreme way state-sanctioned murder, and our 
society's contempt for those at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, years from now, when the U.S. is the last democracy to ban the death 
penalty, Bird will gain her rightful place in history as a champion of justice. 
The death penalty is not a punishment, it's a crime.

In the abortion debate, I find myself usually on the sidelines unable to 
stomach the dishonesty and contrived nature of the rhetoric. 
</P>

However, I am appalled at the stand taken by John Van de Kamp on the abortion 
for gender selection issue. This strikes me as morally idiotic and cannot 
represent the best thinking of the pro-choice side.

The column from the assistant professor of theology, about alleged "man-hating" 
at Mills, was curious ("In Academe, Misogyny Meets Its Match: Misandrosy," by 
Patrick M. Arnold, Commentary, May 14). Here is a Jesuit priest who is 
currently writing a book on masculine spirituality -- obviously a special kind 
of man. 
</P>
<P>
Now the good father is upset that the women of Mills College prefer the company 
of other women in their continuing studies. 
</P>
<P>
Does he write a sweet, well-reasoned note, gently chiding Mills students for 
seeking the companionship and support of their sisters? Hell, no! This product 
of an all-male seminary -- who would probably react furiously were even a 
"spiritual male" to enroll in a convent -- this temperate priest did a Jimmy 
Breslin: He wrote a nasty, intemperate, bigoted, name-calling, woman-hating 
diatribe. 
</P>
<P>
As a man whose sister was a nun and whose brother was a priest, I am ashamed of 
Arnold and his "toxic-sexist" soul. Fortunately, the women of Mills won't hate 
him, only pity him. His essay reflects one of the reasons they do not wish to 
study with men.

<P>
She told The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration (officials in the West) seem to have focused the majority of their 
enforcement efforts against small business owners, who have much more 
difficulty fulfilling a multitude of paperwork requirements. They've focused a 
lot on particular industries on the restaurant industry, for example. 
</P>
<P>
They've focused on ethnic-sounding restaurants. Many fines have been levied not 
for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens, but for not filling out the (I-9) 
forms correctly. 
</P>
<P>
An employer, in filling out these forms, really feels as if he's got to make a 
judgment call as to whether or not the documents being presented are good or 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
(Many employers hiring workers) choose the one that doesn't look foreign, that 
doesn't have an accent, because you think that this is a safe person to hire, 
and that person's document may be OK. It's resulted in discrimination, and it's 
not fair. But it's also not fair to the employer, who's being placed in the 
position of having to make a judgment call with high stakes involved if the 
decision is wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
Will this be the last bilateral summit meeting between the leaders of the 
United States and the Soviet Union? Perhaps not. Institutions always take time 
to catch up with reality, and winding up an old institution almost always takes 
longer than building up a new one. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to imagine, especially if you are too young to have a clear memory 
of the early postwar era, that all postwar history has been punctuated by such 
summits. We have been told often enough, after all, that the postwar world is 
or was a "bipolar" one. But actually the first bilateral U.S.-Soviet summit was 
held in 1961, between John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. Previous East-West 
summits -- in 1955 and 1960 -- had been four-power affairs. Britain and France 
were included not by virtue of their actual importance at the time, but because 
their loss of importance since the period of real four-power diplomacy 
(1945-47) could not be publicly admitted without awkwardness. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral summits eventually became more or less regular occurrences just at 
the time -- the 1960s -- when the world was ceasing to be bipolar, with the 
Sino-Soviet split on the Eastern side and the emergence of Europe and Japan as 
economic powers (not to mention Charles de Gaulle's demonstrations of political 
independence) on the Western one. By now, in 1990, they are clearly an 
anachronism. The only thing that the United States and the Soviet Union can 
seriously hope to settle between themselves is a strategic arms reduction 
treaty, because it is only the sheer size of their strategic nuclear stockpiles 
that still puts them clearly in a class apart from other states. But the rest 
of the world now feels much less concerned by this aspect of arms control than 
it did in the past. A direct exchange of nuclear strikes between the two could 
still be catastrophic for the rest of the planet, but it no longer seems very 
likely -- and it would still be possible even with much lower numbers of 
weapons on each side than are envisaged in the treaty now being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
For other purposes an exchange of views between the leaders of these two powers 
may be useful or even necessary, but no more so than the meetings that they 
each have separately with, for instance, French President Francois Mitterrand. 
Indeed, discussions are likely to focus, on German unity and the future 
security structure of Europe, it could be argued that they should be less 
interested in one another's views than in those of West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
The special build-up given to a U.S.-Soviet summit is a kind of courtesy, just 
as it was a courtesy to go on treating Britain and France as notionally equal 
"great powers" in the 1950s. To a certain extent it reflects American 
self-importance. To a greater extent it is a courtesy to the Soviet Union, and 
to Gorbachev in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, poor Gorby. An American columnist has compared him to Jimmy Carter. Yet 
who could deny that America in 1980 was a model of order, prosperity and 
successful government compared to the Soviet Union today? The question is not 
merely whether it is a power capable of negotiating on equal terms with the 
United States, but whether it is going to survive. Seldom can any national 
parliament have heard a confession of failure quite as abject as that of the 
Soviet prime minister last Friday: "We have no more money. We have no more gold 
to buy grain." Violence in Armenia, the secession of the Baltic republics -- 
these seem like little local difficulties now that Russia itself is threatened 
with mass starvation, perhaps even civil war, while the government of the 
Ukraine declares its "firm opposition" to Gorbachev'sreforms. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now Gorbachev has used his popularity abroad, his good relations with 
foreign leaders (especially those of the United States), and the general aura 
of success and dynamism surrounding his foreign policy as a means of bolstering 
his prestige and tiding him through difficulties at home. Like other leaders in 
other countries before him, he has found that this tactic produces sharply 
diminishing returns. Worse, the point has now been reached where the main 
transference is in the opposite direction: It is domestic events that influence 
international reactions more than the other way round. 
</P>
<P>
In fact it was the changes within the Soviet Union, as much as if not more than 
those in foreign policy, which brought Gorbachev his great popularity abroad in 
the first place. The sudden blossoming of pluralism and freedom of expression 
in what had been the monolithic "evil empire" made it possible to take 
seriously his talk of "universal human values" and to believe that changes in 
foreign policy, with the weight of Soviet public opinion behind them, would not 
be easily reversed. But now even the Soviet leader's most sincere and 
enthusiastic well-wishers in the West are obliged to take notice of his growing 
unpopularity at home and his inability to control events. It seems almost 
quaint to remember that a year ago Western diplomats were seriously worried 
that the cautious, lackluster President Bush might prove no match for the 
charismatic Soviet leader with his bold and innovative vision. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, Gorbachev's position is now as weak abroad as it is at home. At 
home he may well be tempted to revert to dictatorial methods and could perhaps 
expect some support if he did so, given the disastrous material results of his 
half-hearted economic liberalism. But "administrative command" will not bring 
food into the shops and it seems very doubtful whether the 
administrative-repressive machine would any longer respond to Gorbachev's 
touch. If it did so, it might well be only for a short period before he was 
either replaced by a more consistent and resolute authoritarian or swept away 
by a new explosion of popular anger. 
</P>
<P>
Abroad, he cannot now, after allowing a free election in East Germany to 
produce a government committed to unification, use the Soviet forces there to 
prevent that program from being carried out. Nor can he prevent the united 
German state from deciding for itself whether it wishes to remain in NATO, and 
if so on what terms. Nor can he very long keep Soviet forces in Germany if the 
clear wish of the German people is that they depart. Nor indeed can he force 
other Central European countries, which now have representative governments 
looking to the West for economic aid and political inspiration, to take his 
side in a sudden renewal of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
That being so, he must know that to break off "the whole process of 
negotiations in Europe," as he threatened in his press conference with 
Mitterrand on Friday, would damage the Soviet Union much more than it could the 
West. Its most likely outcome would be the one he most wants to avoid -- the 
exclusion of the Soviet Union from Europe, leaving it to flounder, unaided, in 
the grim aftermath of communism. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev hopes to avoid that by modifying the structure and attitudes of NATO 
and by persuading the West to join him in building new pan-European 
institutions. For that he needs the support of Western, especially German, 
public opinion, and he may yet be able to get it. But uttering empty threats is 
not the way.

MEUSBORN PROVIDES CORRECT ANSWER IN FINAL TEST

One year ago today, 29-year-old Tom Meusborn was poring over the roster of the 
Grant High junior varsity, trying to figure out which ninth-graders might be 
strong enough to throw a ball 60 feet 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
One season was all it took for the former Grant junior varsity coach to take 
his first varsity team to the City Section 4-A Division championship. 
Chatsworth scored two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning Wednesday at 
Dodger Stadium to upset El Camino Real, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in shock," Meusborn said. "It was a great, great, great, great first 
year." 
</P>
<P>
With one bold stroke, Meusborn and Chatsworth squeezed the life out of favored 
El Camino Real when shortstop Tommy Lee laid down a bunt with the bases loaded 
and one out to score Nestor Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time all year we've run a suicide squeeze," Meusborn said. 
</P>
<P>
Meusborn called for bunts three times in the seventh, contributing to the 
dramatic conclusion. With the Chancellors trailing, 2-1, Rodney Bloom opened 
the inning with a walk off El Camino Real starter Pat Treend. Meusborn, 
coaching in the third base box, signaled for his No. 3 hitter, Martinez, and 
cleanup hitter Mike Mancuso, to bunt. Both calls worked. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez reached base when Treend threw late to second in an attempt to nail 
Bloom. Mancuso also reached safely on Herman Merchan's fielding error. 
</P>
<P>
After Chatsworth tied the score, 2-2, and loaded the bases with one out, 
Meusborn went with his hot hand -- the bunt call. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy Lee's a great bunter," Meusborn said. "I knew if it was near the plate, 
he'd get it down." 
</P>
<P>
Down it went and down went El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Meusborn, the second consecutive rookie coach to win a City title (he follows 
Kennedy's Manny Alvarado), accomplished the feat for a school that last won a 
City title in 1983 but stumbled in the semifinals at the end of the decade. The 
Chancellors lost in the semifinals in each of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the Chatsworth cheers was starting pitcher Reed McMackin, the only 
leftover from the 1988 team that was ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today 
before losing a semifinal game. He proved a perfect beneficiary of Meusborn's 
freshness. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin, who worked 5 2/3 innings Wednesday, said that he had received a call 
from former Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano before the game. And what did the 
coach who suffered all those semifinal losses have to say? 
</P>
<P>
"He just said, 'Congratulations,' " McMackin said. 
</P>
<P>
One can imagine that McMackin, Meusborn, Lee -- and the rest of these unlikely 
champions -- will hear those words for weeks to come.

LITTLE BALL LIFTS CHATSWORTH OVER EL CAMINO REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As far as trademarks go, it isn't as glamorous as being known for slamming 
balls into cornfields, winning batting titles with a million hits or driving in 
runs by the bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lee's hallmark is a little more subtle, something on a more refined and 
smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
Bunting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my specialty," said Lee, Chatsworth High's shortstop. "I like to push and 
I like to drag." 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday night's City Section 4-A Division championship game at Dodger 
Stadium, Lee's bunting was a drag, indeed, for favored El Camino Real, which 
fell to Chatsworth, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded, one out and the score tied, 2-2, in the seventh, Lee 
laid down a perfect suicide squeeze to drive in Nestor Martinez from third with 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy Lee is a great bunter," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "I knew if 
it was near the plate that he was going to get it down." 
</P>
<P>
With El Camino Real leading, 2-1, Conquistadore right-hander Pat Treend walked 
Rodney Bloom to open the seventh. Martinez then laid down a sacrifice bunt, but 
Treend's attempt to get the lead runner at second was late. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup batter Mike Mancuso then laid down another bunt, which Treend fielded 
and fired to second baseman Herman Merchan covering at first. Merchan, however, 
missed the ball for an error and Bloom scored to tie the game. Martinez moved 
to third on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Treend (12-1) then caught a looper off the bat of reliever Mitch Root (2-1) -- 
who struck out the three batters he faced in the seventh -- for the first out. 
Mancuso stole second without a throw from Treend and Reed McMackin was walked 
intentionally to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, who missed half of the season because of a shoulder injury, then executed 
a textbook squeeze on the first pitch -- the Chancellors' first hit of the 
inning. First baseman Ryan McGuire gloved the ball but was unable to make a 
throw home. McGuire, in frustration, kicked the ball into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Treend, cruising along with a four-hit shutout, walked three consecutive 
batters in the sixth to load the bases, then allowed a run-scoring single by 
No. 9 hitter Adam Pearlman to bring Chatsworth to within 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Treend, who had struck out six and allowed just five hits entering the sixth, 
walked nine, including five in the last two innings as Chatsworth (24-5-1) 
rallied from a two-run deficit. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (21-3-1) took a 1-0 lead in the fourth. McMackin yielded an 
infield single to Bobby Kim to open the inning, with Kim beating the throw from 
third baseman Pearlman with a headfirst dive at first. 
</P>
<P>
After moving to second on a wild pitch, Kim took third on another headfirst 
slide after Greg Ledermen launched a fly ball to center. 
</P>
<P>
Treend, who leads El Camino Real in runs batted in and had an RBI in two of the 
team's first three playoff games, delivered a run-scoring bullet to center, 
raising his season RBI total to 28 and a pointed finger toward McMackin. Kim 
raised a fist as he scored. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, McMackin surrendered a single to Sean Boldt but escaped the 
inning by retiring Gregg Sheren on a fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real took a 2-0 lead in the sixth when pinch-hitter Josh Massey, who 
entered the game batting .260, drilled a two-out single down the right-field 
line to drive in Merchan from third. Massey's hit, the ninth for El Camino 
Real, chased McMackin, who was relieved by left-hander Danny Rodriguez.

HARVARD RIDES DOUBLES WINS TO TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Buoyed by consistent doubles play, Harvard High recovered from a slow start and 
defeated Cate, 10-8, to win the Southern Section 2-A Division tennis 
championship at Balboa Park in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Under Coach Harry Salamandra, Harvard (17-2) has won four consecutive Southern 
Section titles, two in the 1-A Division and two in the 2-A. Cate (22-2), which 
is located in Carpinteria, was the Condor League champion and the top-seeded 
team in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew that they had the potential to outplay this team," Salamandra said 
of his players. "But they'd have to work awful hard to do it." 
</P>
<P>
As was the case in the quarterfinals and semifinals, the Saracens fell behind 
in the first of three rounds. Cate held a 4-2 advantage after the first round 
and quickly recorded a singles victory to begin the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard battled back and forged a 6-6 tie to close the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"They're fighters," Salamandra said. "They seem to play better when they're 
down. They are slow starting but I don't know if it is nerves or what." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's Pat List, who plays No. 1 doubles with Chris Pisano, has a different 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
"We get out of the warmup and we're just not thinking tennis," said List, who 
lost the first set before winning the final two. 
</P>
<P>
Some Harvard players, however, were thinking tennis. The No. 2 doubles team of 
sophomore Steve Jang and freshman Josh Litter, swept its opponents, defeating 
Matt Schwartz and John Crew, 7-5; Fritz Hummelt and Nick Meyer, 6-3; and Seth 
Mallen and William Pan, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to be tough," Cate Coach Robert Bonning said of Jang and 
Litter. "Both have nice crisp volleys, they keep the ball down and they're 
tough on points." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, they don't exactly inspire fear in their opponents when they take 
the court: Litter is 5 feet tall, and Jang stands 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear people say, 'Hey, hit it to the small guy,' " said Litter, who has been 
playing in tournaments for four years. "I just try to stay consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to intimidate me. I have to keep my head together and try to pull 
the points out." 
</P>
<P>
Raj Vaswani also contributed to the win. Harvard's top singles player, Vaswani 
was the only Saracen to win two sets in singles, defeating Till Falke, 6-2, and 
Dennis Phelps, 6-1. He lost to Jim Vincent, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard beat San Dimas, Montclair, Santa Maria and Keppel to reach the final. 
The Saracens, who shared the San Fernando Valley League title with Notre Dame 
then lost a coin flip, were seeded sixth in the tournament.

JUMP HIGH, CATCH A BOAT, THEN DANCE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: GARDENA'S CHARLES MABRY HAS TWO GOALS FRIDAY NIGHT: QUALIFY FOR THE 
STATE FINALS IN THE HIGH JUMP, AND MAKE THE SENIOR PROM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday will be anything but just another day in the life of Gardena High senior 
Charles Mabry. 
</P>
<P>
After competing in the state championship track and field meet at Cerritos 
College, the high jumper will rush to the senior prom -- he hopes. Gardena's 
prom is being held on a boat this year, and Mabry hopes to arrive at the dock 
just before 9:30 p.m., the scheduled departure time. 
</P>
<P>
Mabry said he has his priorities in order heading into his big day and night. 
He has vowed not to worry about getting to the prom while he is competing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get to the track meet, I'm going to tune (the prom) out," said Mabry, 
who will check in at Cerritos College at 5:30 p.m. "I'm going to leave my watch 
up in my bag." 
</P>
<P>
Mabry won last week's L.A. City title with a personal-best high jump of 6 feet, 
5 inches. He has come a long way since being discovered as a high jumper by an 
assistant coach just over three years ago, when he was a sophomore in his first 
year at Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, a coach saw me jumping on the field," said Mabry, who 
had no experience as a high jumper. "And he said: 'Hey, you jump really high. 
Why don't you jump for us?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mabry said he was surprised how quickly he took to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We had five high jumpers on the team, and at the beginning of the year, 
everybody else was jumping higher than me," he said. "But by the end of the 
year, I exploded on them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, relatively speaking, he was a novice. His top mark for the year was 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been constantly striving to improve his technique. 
</P>
<P>
"By my junior year, I got my arch down really well, which helped me a lot," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But his rate of improvement didn't satisfy him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty upset that I only got fifth (in the City finals) last year, so 
that gave me an extra push this year," Mabry said. 
</P>
<P>
He will have to keep pushing himself if he is to have an impact at the state 
meet. Ten other high jumpers have better qualifying marks, including Katella's 
Kevin Carlson, who tops the field at 6-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes got big when I saw some of those marks," Mabry said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he is confident that he will post a new personal best Friday. As 
far back as a year ago, he recorded a 6-6 jump in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything correctly on that first (6-6 jump)," Mabry said. "From the 
arch to the run, everything was on -- I remember that feeling well. 
</P>
<P>
"I can probably get 6-10 if I do that again." 
</P>
<P>
Last week at the City finals, Mabry had his body over the bar at 6-8. "But I 
got kind of lazy and my elbow dropped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mabry said he was otherwise exceptionally primed for the City meet at 
Birmingham High in Van Nuys. He gave his Mohican teammates, particularly triple 
jumper Henry Fraijo, pole vaulter Larry Merritt and shot putter Robert Walker, 
credit for motivating him. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends were pushing me, saying, 'You know you can do it,' " Mabry said. 
"They all pump me up. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have that drive because we love (track and field). They're pushing me 
to knock it out -- first the City title, then the state title." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena Coach Bill Berry and his staff have been doing their part to get Mabry 
to emulate a former Olympic great. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep mentioning Dwight Stones," Mabry said. "So I try to pattern my 
jumping off of him. 
</P>
<P>
"They've showed me a tape of him, and I've been watching that every time I get 
the chance. And then they brought a video camera here to tape me jumping." 
</P>
<P>
By comparing his form with Stones', Mabry has learned one particularly valuable 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to use my arms more," Mabry said. "I'm not using my arms at all. I'm 
just jumping with straight leg power. If I use my arms, that'll give me an 
extra five inches." 
</P>
<P>
The high jumpers with the nine top marks at Friday's preliminaries will advance 
to Saturday's state finals, also at Cerritos College. Mabry is confident that 
he will be participating both days. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to come in at 6-8 and hit it," he said of his plan for Friday. "I 
know I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Mabry said 6-8 will be good enough to advance to the finals, and the records of 
his competitors also suggest that. Only seven high jumpers in the field have 
qualifying marks of 6-8 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably be nervous, most definitely," he said. "But I'm going to try to 
focus everything I've got on that 6-8 jump." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 173-pound Mabry said he plans to continue his high-jumping career 
at Los Angeles Southwest College or El Camino College next year. He wants to 
transfer to USC in order to perform on the Trojans' track team and study 
electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
His ultimate athletic goal is to high jump 8 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight is very high, but I believe I can do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, of course, he's busy worrying about 6-8. And once that's done, he's 
got to start thinking about 9:30, because he has a boat to catch, after all. 
</P>
<P>
His date for the prom, Laneia Moore, has been understanding about Mabry's need 
to be at the state meet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's nervous, but she said it's OK," Mabry said. He added with a laugh: "I 
just might have to rent a helicopter, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne and Morningside high schools have their girls' relay teams in the 
state meet. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne 400-meter relay team is led off by sophomore Kanika Cartwright, 
followed by seniors Kee-Sha Adams and Mia Edmondson and freshman Porshia King. 
</P>
<P>
Adams anchors the Cougars' 1,600-meter relay team, preceded by King, freshman 
Jalauna Gilford and senior Tarina Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
For the Monarchs, freshman LaShawn Stringer leads off the 400-meter relay, 
followed by sophomore Sanoma Nickson, senior Toneshia Hodges and sophomore 
Santeshia Arnold. On the 1,600 relay, Stringer is first, Arnold second, Hodges 
third and Stringer fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who is also entered in the 100 and 200 meters, is competing in her 
first state meet, although she probably would have participated in 1989 if she 
hadn't been sidelined by a stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
There are 28 entrants in each event at the two-day state meet. After Friday's 
preliminary round, nine entrants per event will advance to Saturday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
Each CIF section sends a set number of competitors in each event to the state 
meet. The Southern Section sends five; the L.A. City Section and the North 
Coast Section each send four; the Central Section, Central Coast Section, 
Sac-Joaquin Section and San Diego Section each send three, and the Northern 
Section, Oakland Section and San Francisco Section each send one. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, gates open at 3 p.m., when the field events get under way. Running 
events begin at 5 p.m. Admission is $3 for high school students with 
identification and $6 for general admission. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, gates open at 4 p.m., when the field events start. Two hours 
later, track events begin. Admission is $4 for high school students and $7 for 
general admission.

CAL POLY POMONA OFFERING LEE A NEW START ON BASKETBALL LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT SENIOR WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RARE SITUATION TO PLAY 
FOR BRONCOS NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount reserve center Marcellus Lee thought he had played the final 
basketball game of his college career when the buzzer sounded ending his team's 
contest against Nevada-Las Vegas in the NCAA quarterfinals in March. 
</P>
<P>
The seldom-used senior assumed he had completed his college eligibility by 
sitting out his freshman year, because he didn't meet Proposition 48 entrance 
requirements, and playing for the Lions the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But a unique situation unfolded that would allow the 22-year-old Lee to play 
another collegiate season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ecstatic about it," he said. "For me it was a chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
The catch was that Lee would have to play at the Division II level or lower. As 
a result of an interpretation of the Proposition 48 rule that was made during 
the 1988 NCAA convention, Lee was eligible to transfer to a Division II or III 
school and play one more season. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule said that a (Proposition 48 player) was entitled to only three 
seasons of eligibility in Division I," said Steve Mallonee of NCAA legislative 
services. "But it didn't say anything about the other divisions. Now, with 
these players being seniors, for the first time you're seeing kids who are in a 
position to take advantage of this." 
</P>
<P>
(Mallonee said for transfers to be eligible to compete without the usual 
one-year waiting period, they must also meet the requirements established by 
Proposition 65, which was passed at the NCAA convention in February. That makes 
a player eligible to play immediately at a lower division school if they are a 
first-time transfer, receive a release from their former school and are making 
satisfactory progress toward a degree -- requirements that Lee has met.) 
</P>
<P>
Loyola assistant coach Jay Hillock said it was the second chance the 6-foot-9, 
230-pound Lee needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the greatest thing that could've happened to that kid," he said. "I think 
there's two ways that this is going to be a definite plus for Marcellus. He's 
going to get a chance to extend his education, which is always a benefit. He's 
also going to get a chance to get a little more playing time than he got here." 
</P>
<P>
The only decision remaining for Lee was what school he would attend. As it 
turned out, it was not a difficult choice. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock suggested Cal Poly Pomona, a Division II school that competes in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn., and Lee was more than willing to listen. 
After all, he had played at Pomona High and many of his relatives still live in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't any other schools that I really thought about," Lee said. 
"(Pomona) showed the most interest in me. The coach (Dave Bollwinkel) came out 
to a couple practices and he was able to see me at my best and when I wasn't so 
good so he knew what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Bollwinkel, whose Pomona squad has four starters but little size returning next 
season, said he was more than interested in Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"I got wind of this possible loophole through a friend and then one of the 
Loyola coaches (Hillock) spoke to me about Lee and then he spoke to (Loyola 
Coach) Paul Westhead," Bollwinkel said. "They both thought it was a good idea 
and they both spoke to Marcellus and he was for it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"From that point it was just like recruiting any other transfer student. He 
came here on a visit and he liked what he saw." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the fact that the school was close to home, Lee was most excited 
about finally having a chance to see considerable playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt all along that all I needed was a chance to play," he said. "I still 
felt I could prove myself as a player. Before this came up, I was just working 
hard and looking forward to going to Europe (to play) and then this came along 
and it was one more year to play. I just thought it was a great opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Playing time was always at a premium for Lee at Loyola Marymount, where he 
appeared in only 40 games in three seasons. He had his best statistics as a 
sophomore, when he averaged 3.8 points and 2.3 rebounds in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the right program at the wrong time," Lee said. "I was always playing 
behind an All-American and a lot of good people." 
</P>
<P>
Hillock and Bollwinkel agree that Lee also didn't fit in well with Loyola 
Marymount's run-and-gun offensive approach. The Lions were the highest scoring 
team in the NCAA last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We play quite fast so we didn't have a chance to utilize his full strengths," 
Hillock said. "If he gets a chance to utilize them, he has a lot of ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Marcellus is a Division I basketball player. He didn't play a lot for 
us but I think he would have at a lot of programs. The only thing against him 
is his lack of playing experience but he has the physical attributes to be 
pretty successful at the Division II level." 
</P>
<P>
It is Lee's physical attributes that have Bollwinkel excited. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a guy that brings a dimension into Division II that you don't see 
a lot of at this level," Bollwinkel said. "There aren't many guys (6-9 and 230) 
at this level and not many with his large arm span. He has the arm span of a 
seven-footer." 
</P>
<P>
Bollwinkel said it will also benefit Lee to have practiced and played for three 
seasons with players such as the late Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
"He might have been a third-string player but you have to remember he was 
playing for a Loyola team that was ranked in the top 20," he said. "He should 
be a little more free to play up to his abilities here." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee said, he will benefit from receiving more personalized 
attention from the Pomona coaching staff next season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was (at Loyola) I would work hard but I didn't have anyone to really 
work with me," he said. "Now that I have someone who's interested in me and 
also is willing to work with me, I know I can push hard for the team and also 
for (Bollwinkel)." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos figure to be among the most improved teams in the CCAA. Transfers 
Andre Harrell, a guard from Valley College, and Eric Mobley, a forward from the 
University of Portland, figure to help Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of potential for the team and that's what I like about it," Lee 
said. "They realized that they needed help and I want to help them. I'm not 
just looking at it for myself. I'm looking to help a program that has potential 
and I think the program definitely has that." 
</P>
<P>
An urban studies major at Loyola, Lee is only three units shy of completing 
requirements for a bachelor's degree. But he insists he will not be looking for 
easy classes to attend in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take courses that will be beneficial to me," he said. "I'm planning to 
take classes that'll help me in and out of my major. I'm not just taking 
classes so I can have a kick-back year." 
</P>
<P>
He also doesn't plan to take the court next season in a laid-back fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"My intention is to play hard and go hard in practice every day and just keep 
working at it," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, he is still living in Westchester near the Loyola campus and 
plans to play in pick-up games with his former teammates during the summer. He 
also has a conditioning program planned. 
</P>
<P>
"That'll be my main goal," Lee said. "I want to be in top physical condition 
because I want to be able to play as much as possible. So I want to play in a 
lot of quality pick-up games. I want to go into the season in top physical 
shape and make a definite impact." 
</P>
<P>
After three years as a reserve at Loyola, Lee wants to make the most of this 
opportunity.

CSUN PRIMED FOR PRIME TIME AFTER DIVISION II TRACK FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although he would like to say "I told you so," Cal State Northridge track and 
field Coach Don Strametz was as pleasantly surprised as anyone with the 
Northridge men's second-place finish in last week's championships at Hampton 
(Va.) University. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, who led for the first two days of the three-day meet before being 
overtaken by defending champion St. Augustine's on Saturday, registered the 
highest finish by a Northridge team since 1979 when they also placed second. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors won the Division II title in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal going into the meet was the same as it was at the start of the 
season, to finish in the top 10 in both the men's and women's standings," 
Strametz said. "I never really thought we'd finish second. Especially with Walt 
(Stewart) and Tyrone (Jeffries) redshirting this season." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the 1989 Division II champion in the high jump, and Jeffries, a 
seven-time All-American in the hurdles and relays, redshirted so they could 
compete next year when the Matadors move to Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd be sacrificing points this year to make an impact next year," 
Strametz said. "But the other kids just picked up the slack in their absence." 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Chris Perry (long jump) and Erick McBride (800 meters) and junior 
Kevin Hendrix (100) each won titles for Northridge, which produced three 
Division II champions for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Perry and McBride won the Matadors' first-ever titles in their respective 
events, and Hendrix was the first Matador to win the 100 since Steve Brodi in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say enough about the way those three guys performed," Strametz said. 
"None of them were favored, but they all came through. For Hendrix to win the 
100 with the injuries he's had, for Perry to come from behind to win against 
seasoned competitors, and for McBride to win the 800 leading from the front, 
were just great performances." 
</P>
<P>
Although McBride's victory was not that shocking -- he had the fastest Division 
II time this season -- the manner in which he won was; he led from start to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"We were counting on the element of surprise, and it worked," Strametz said. 
"Erick's tactics definitely caught the rest of the field off guard. . . . After 
the race, several of the other coaches who were along the backstretch came up 
to me and said, 'You did what the rest of us didn't have the guts to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Speed kills: Northridge, which totaled 60 points, had more balanced scoring 
than St. Augustine's, but the Matadors could not match the Falcons' depth in 
the speed department. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring system, St. Augustine's scored 100 of its 
111 points in the explosive, speed-oriented events. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons racked up 18 points in the long jump, 16 in the 400-meter 
intermediate hurdles, and 10 each in the 100, 110 high hurdles, 400 and 1,600 
relay, and high jump. They added eight points in both the 200 and triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Lolita Pile bounded into the Northridge record book in two 
categories with her performances in the Division II meet. 
</P>
<P>
She became the first Northridge four-time All-American in any one track and 
field event when she placed second in the triple jump, and her third-place 
finish in the long jump and fourth-place effort as a member of the Lady 
Matadors' 400 relay made her a six-time Division II All-American, tying her 
with Darcy Arreola for the most by a Lady Matador. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who is redshirting at CSUN this season, earned six Division II 
All-American certificates from 1987-89, and was a Division I All-American in 
the 1,500 meters last season, placing third. 
</P>
<P>
Pile will try to match Arreola's feat when she competes in the triple jump in 
the Division I championships at Duke University this week. 
</P>
<P>
Injury saga: The injury woes of Cal State Los Angeles' Marlene Wilcox continued 
at Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
Sidelined for several seasons with numerous physical aliments, the former 
Thousand Oaks High standout had a good shot to finish in the top three in the 
women's 800, but a muscle cramp in her hamstring forced her to drop out of her 
qualifying heat. 
</P>
<P>
"She's had problems with (the muscle cramps) since Fresno (Relays in April)," 
Cal State L. A. assistant Greg Ryan said. "But we thought we had it under 
control. She's been seeing several specialists and they seem to think it's a 
sciatic nerve problem. . . . It's too bad it had to happen here because she was 
ready to run fast. I don't think she could have beaten (Teena) Colebrook, but 
she was ready to run 2:06." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney on a roll: With the first three finishers breaking 46 seconds, freshman 
Rodney Burt of Cal State Bakersfield finished a distant fourth in the men's 
400-meter dash, yet he ran a personal best of 46.88 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, from Birmingham High, had run 48.28 and placed fifth in the 400 in the 
City Section championships as a junior in 1988, but he faded to seventh as a 
senior after being slowed by injuries and the chickenpox during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Burt stayed healthy this year and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
After lowering his personal best to 48.02 in an early-season meet, Burt ran 
47.98 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on April 28, won the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. title in 47.63 on May 12, and ran 47.34 to place second in his 
qualifying heat at nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run quite as fast as I wanted to, but I'm pretty happy with the 
season," Burt said. "Winning the CCAA meet was a big deal to me. That really 
helped my confidence at nationals." 
</P>
<P>
Eagle watch: Mark Walsh and Teresa Poy, two Cal State L. A. athletes with ties 
to the Valley area, earned All-American certificates in Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, a senior from Notre Dame High, placed sixth in the decathlon with 6,593 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Poy, a junior who transferred from Northridge in 1988, finished seventh in the 
women's 1,500 (4:30.65) on Saturday after a disappointing ninth (10:09.31) in 
the 3,000 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers watch: The California Collegiate Athletic Assn. and the Central 
Intercollegiate Athletic Assn. were the most powerful conferences in the 
Division II meet. 
</P>
<P>
CCAA teams placed second, fourth and fifth in the men's meet, and first and 
fifth in the women's, while CIAA squads finished first and third in the men's 
meet, and second and sixth in the women's. 
</P>
<P>
CCAA and CIAA athletes scored 172 points each in the men's meet, while CCAA 
athletes scored 180 1/2 points and CIAA representatives totaled 136 in the 
women's meet.

COLORFUL PLAY-BY-PLAY AS SHOWY AS A PEACOCK

MONTGOMERY, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The assault that Cal State Northridge hitters have waged on opposing pitchers 
has inspired some creative writing by Mike Peacock, who types out the official 
play-by-play for media covering the NCAA Division II World Series. 
</P>
<P>
A few of Peacock's one-liners from Northridge's 18-5 decision over New Haven on 
Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
On Eric Johnson's fly ball to right that was dropped for an error: 
</P>
<P>
"Johnson hits a rocket into the gap in right center, but (Tim) Burrows is 
there, reaches up, and swats it away from him like a mosquito." 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, a home run by Mike Solar: "Solar taps into one of his power 
cells and launches a BOMB over the scoreboard in left, 3-run dinger." 
</P>
<P>
On a bouncer hit by Mike Sims that went for a single: "Sims bounces a blind 
man's dog to right (seeing-eye single)." 
</P>
<P>
Peacock also had some fun describing a few of the outs. 
</P>
<P>
On a Scott Sharts strikeout victim: "(Adrian) Clark gives the Charger dugout a 
nice breeze as he whiffs at strike three." 
</P>
<P>
On a wild pitch, Peacock wrote that the runner moved up on a "savagely uncouth 
hurl." 
</P>
<P>
However, the night's classic was saved for CSUN's 21st hit of the game. When 
Solar made the score 13-3 by blasting his second home run of the night, Peacock 
wrote: "Solar rips the corona off that "ball" as it leaves a vapor trail 
leaving the park. There is a brief delay in the action as a brawl is occurring 
around the bat rack in the Matador dugout." 
</P>
<P>
Peacock was using poetic license, of course, but only in moderation. The 
Matadors did, indeed, look eager to hit. 
</P>
<P>
Prolific production: After totaling only 10 hits in its two victories over UC 
Riverside in the West regional, Northridge has scored 36 runs on 49 hits in its 
two World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors have 37 singles, four doubles, a triple, seven home runs and a 
batting average of .505. In addition, CSUN has been on the receiving end of 14 
walks and a hit batter. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will play Lewis today at 1:30 PDT at Paterson Field. Lewis 
eliminated New Haven, 3-2, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to pitch for CSUN is Vale Lopez (11-4), who allowed three runs on 11 
hits in eight innings when the Matadors defeated Lewis, 18-5, in their opener 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a senior right-hander, has won his past eight decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Third baseman Denny Vigo, second on the team with 19 home runs 
and and third with 58 runs batted in, is listed as questionable for today's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo was held out of practice Wednesday after pulling up with a hamstring 
injury after singling in the sixth inning against New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo was examined by a trainer from Troy (Ala.) State on Wednesday. The injury 
was diagnosed as a tear in the muscle just above Vigo's right knee. Coach Bill 
Kernen said he likely will hold Vigo out of today's game. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see how much better it gets, and how fast," Kernen said. "We may 
just use him as a pinch-hitter, or maybe not at all." 
</P>
<P>
Kernen said either Craig Clayton or Andy Hodgins will move from the outfield to 
third base. Both made appearances at the position in the late innings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo was in an 0-for-15 slump entering the New Haven game, but he was three for 
three with a walk before pulling up lame. 
</P>
<P>
New experience: Northridge's 18-5 rout of New Haven was only the Chargers' 
fourth loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It came in a fashion New Haven had not experienced. The Chargers' other losses 
were all by one run. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be humbling," Kernen said. "I remember Cal Lutheran. You just go, 'Holy 
. . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, an NAIA team, beat CSUN, 18-3, in February. 
</P>
<P>
Super sub: In appearances as a substitute in both of CSUN's World Series games, 
Kyle Washington is four for four with three singles and a three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
In four pinch-hitting appearances during the regular season, Washington was one 
for four. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit there and I see everybody else hitting, so when I get a chance to get in 
there, I want to make the most of it," said Washington, a part-time starter. 
"I'm just trying to be consistent like the rest of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
Police blotter: Montgomery police reported Wednesday that they had no leads in 
the theft of personal belongings from the hotel rooms of several members of the 
Northridge baseball team Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Cassette disks, a cassette player, two watches, a diamond earring, a wallet and 
various items of apparel were reported stolen by players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The thefts occurred between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. (PDT) on Tuesday while Northridge 
was at Paterson Field for its game against New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
The rooms were locked and someone apparently used a key to gain entrance, a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery Police Sgt. Ricky Moore said his department will keep tabs on local 
pawn shops in an effort to track the stolen merchandise.

Recycling the Office Garbage 
</P>
<P>
Many businesses are beginning to establish recycling programs for the mountains 
of white paper and the heaps of aluminum, glass and plastic containers they 
throw out on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management -- San Fernando Valley (you've probably seen its dumpsters 
around town) recently began a recycling division that carts away its clients' 
white paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Each person has a desktop recycler box and, during the day, you fill it with 
the white paper you generate. When it's full, you take it to a collection depot 
-- usually a bigger box that's in the photocopy room. Depending on the building 
and the property manager, the paper goes from there into our company's 
container. We cart it away and at the end of the quarter, the company gets a 
check," said Ellen Laxer-Young, recycling coordinator in Waste Management's Sun 
Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
She estimates that her company provides this service for 30 or 40 Valley office 
high-rises, most of them on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling white paper requires a commitment from the person who is doing the 
tossing. The rules change constantly on what is or isn't acceptable. For 
example, calculator tape is in one week, out the next. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tenants have been most receptive to it. They call daily about the 
specifics," said a property manager at Sumitomo Bank Building in Sherman Oaks. 
Several property managers involved in the program at other buildings noted that 
their tenants have set up additional in-house recycling programs for aluminum, 
glass and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Charley Jarrett of 20th Century Fox in Sherman Oaks set up an aluminum can 
recycling program at his office. "My bowling league collects them and uses the 
money for prize funds for our Thanksgiving tournament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Local Hot Spot 
</P>
<P>
You'd think that they were giving the food away at Bobby's Coffee Shop on 
Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills. On weekends, people wait out on the 
sidewalk in the blazing Valley sun for their name to be called. 
</P>
<P>
What's the allure? 
</P>
<P>
Merle DePrey of Woodland Hills figures that he has been going to Bobby's for 25 
years. "It's got a great atmosphere -- noisy, busy. You smell the fresh bacon 
as you pull up. And if you're with a bunch of guys, you can tell a dirty joke 
and no one will hear you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved here from the East Coast five days ago and we've already been here 
twice," said Susan Eastman of Woodland Hills, who was accompanied by her 
husband and son. "You have to find just the right breakfast spot and this place 
was reputed to be the place. The ultimate compliment is that it's as good as 
Walter's Coffee Shop in Miami. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Many customers like the quantity and quality of the food. "The bacon has meat 
on it," said Aron Marquis, 20, of Woodland Hills. "And there are no heat lamps. 
It comes right off the grill to you." 
</P>
<P>
Waitress Mary Wood has been working there for 26 years. Her assessment: "It's 
friendly, it's busy, it's like a family -- and the tips are good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Biking 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't ridden a bike in a while, what you may remember most is how 
uncomfortable the seat was -- and how uncomfortable your own was when you were 
finished. A number of innovations have made bicycle riding more pleasurable for 
everyone -- babies, toddlers and adults. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the greatest innovations to come along is seat covers that are filled 
with gel made by Spenco. It's the gel that was originally designed for a body 
prosthesis," said Joe Witzman, owner of Chatsworth Cyclery and All-Pro Bicycles 
in Simi Valley. "They also make bicycle gloves with gel inside them. It 
conforms to your body more." 
</P>
<P>
Baby seats have also come a long way. "They now tilt back so that a very young 
baby wearing a helmet doesn't have its neck bent over. The babies are in a more 
comfortable reclining position," Witzman said.

The latest innovation for young children is a trailer that hitches onto the 
back of a bicycle, called a Burley Lite Trailer. "Even if the rider spills, the 
trailer stays upright," Witzman said. It has room for two children with a 
combined weight of 125 pounds. "This is for the serious cycling family, though, 
because a baby seat runs from $45 to $100, whereas this trailer runs around 
$300," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for racing cyclists, the newest craze is aerobars -- especially after Greg 
LeMonde won the Tour de France with them. The handlebars put the body in a more 
aerodynamic position. "They are for a very narrow group of cyclists who are 
very athletically inclined because you do lose some control by extending your 
body out over the front wheel like that," Witzman said.

"When you're at home, you don't dress for breakfast -- you walk around in your 
robe. But here you have more opportunities to get dressed up," Ann Fishman, 82, 
said about life at the Wedgewood Retirement Hotel in Tarzana. "I enjoy nice 
clothes. So every day it's a different outfit." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 senior citizens live at the Wedgewood, which opened in December. 
'It's very unusual because we have a lot of men here," said Greta Rosenberg, 
activity and social director. "It's like an extended family -- everyone is 
concerned about everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
They do like a good time. On June 10, the residents will hold a champagne 
brunch and fashion show at the Wedgewood. "About six or seven of the ladies 
here will be modeling clothes from Draper's in Sherman Oaks Fashion Square," 
Rosenberg said. "Most of the ladies are in their 70s or 80s, and two of the 
models use walkers." 
</P>
<P>
Brunch is $7.95 and starts at 11:30 a.m.; the runway show begins at 1:30 p.m. 
Watch out, Paulina and Cindy.

<P>
POLITICS: MANY OF THE 30 CANDIDATES HAVE DIPPED INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS TO 
FINANCE THEIR BIDS TO WIN SEATS THAT WILL BE FILLED IF CITYHOOD WINS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A land-use attorney has spent $23,448 of his own funds to top the list of 
campaign spenders thus far among candidates for City Council in Malibu's 
incorporation election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Shoop, who has said he will not accept contributions, spent more than the 
combined total of the next two highest campaign spenders, Larry Wan and Missy 
Zeitsoff, according to records filed with the county for the period that ended 
May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Wan, the former head of the Malibu Township Council, a pro-cityhood group, 
spent $12,033 for the period, while Zeitsoff, also associated with the group, 
spent $9,638. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures, required by law, show that many of the 30 candidates have 
dipped deeply into their own pockets as they try to win one of the five City 
Council seats voters will fill at the same time they decide whether Malibu 
becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
And with most candidates supporting cityhood as an attempt to wrest control of 
Malibu from a development-minded county government, major real estate 
developers have been noticeably absent from the list of campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it would be the kiss of death for anyone's campaign to accept 
much developer money," one observer said. 
</P>
<P>
The financial disclosures filed with the county do not include contributions or 
expenditures since May 19. Candidates will not be required to make a complete 
accounting of their finances until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates did not file financial statements. By law, a candidate is not 
required to do so if he or she has not received or spent $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of a pro-cityhood group have complained that the only 
organized group opposing cityhood has failed to make the necessary disclosure 
of where it has obtained its funds. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned Citizens for Protecting Malibu's Future, which has advertised heavily 
against cityhood in Malibu's two weekly newspapers and whose organizers 
acknowledged having collected more than $2,000, had not disclosed its finances 
as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to know where their money is coming from and why they haven't 
bothered to disclose it," said Gary Amo, a political consultant for MCI/YES on 
Y, the pro-cityhood group that was formerly the Malibu Committee for 
Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Richards, treasurer of Concerned Citizens, said the group has applied 
as a political action committee with the state. She attributed the delay in 
disclosing its finances to the group's having only been organized little more 
than a week ago. "We fully intend to comply, and we will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the period that ended May 19, MCI/YES on Y reported contributions of more 
than $66,000 and debts of more than $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among those donating money to the group were celebrities Herb Alpert, Mel 
Brooks, Olivia Newton-John, Henry Mancini, Bob Newhart, Carroll O'Connor, 
George C. Scott, James Whitmore and Burgess Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
Among the candidates, Shoop, Wan and Zeitsoff may have been the leading 
spenders, but they did not have the largest number of contributions, if loans 
and gifts made by candidates to their own campaigns are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Keller, the former co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, 
has collected $10,865 to top the contribution list, followed by Mike Caggiano, 
long associated with the Malibu Township Council, with $8,530, and real estate 
broker Richard Idler, with $7,606. 
</P>
<P>
John Merrick, a retired Municipal Court judge who, along with Keller and Wan, 
is most often mentioned as one of the favorites in the council race, has 
collected $5,220 in contributions, with expenditures of $4,429. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop, who is credited with having greatly increased his name recognition since 
the start of the campaign, has been accused by opponents of standing to benefit 
financially from property he owns should voters approve cityhood and a 
pro-development majority be elected to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shoop has acknowledged that he and his wife own a 50% interest in nine 
acres in the Civic Center area, where a San Luis Obispo firm wants to build 
about 75 condominiums, he has dismissed the criticism as "a lot of nonsense" 
spread by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Wan and Zeitsoff, the two other big spenders for the reporting period, have 
also depended heavily on their own funds to finance their campaigns. Wan and 
his wife loaned his campaign $15,000, although not all of the money had been 
spent, and of the $10,679 in total contributions reported by Zeitsoff, $8,702 
was from a loan to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, excluding money candidates have given or loaned to their own campaigns, 
only seven of the 30 candidates had received contributions of more than $3,000 
for the period, and at least five -- not including Shoop -- had raised no 
funds.

MYSTERY OF EXPLORER ULLOA'S SPANISH GALLEON STILL UNSOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CRAWFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North County Focus today introduces history columnist Richard Crawford, 
archivist and historian for the San Diego Historical Society. He studied 
history in both the undergraduate and graduate programs at San Diego State 
University and has worked for the historical society since 1981. His column 
will appear when there is a fifth Thursday in the month. 
</P>
<P>
It happens every six months or so. An eager visitor to the library of the San 
Diego Historical Society will ask the harried archivists for material on the 
Spanish galleon Trinidad, flagship of explorer Francisco de Ulloa, believed 
wrecked off the coast of Oceanside in 1540 with millions in Aztec gold. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries the story of the Trinidad and the fate of its master, Ulloa, 
mystified historians. Sailing from Acapulco in July, 1539, Ulloa commanded a 
fleet of three ships: the Santa Agueda, the Santo Tomas, and the Trinidad. 
Ulloa carried instructions from the conquistador Hernan Cortes to explore the 
coast to the north and pursue the endless rumors of gold and the legendary 
Seven Cities of Cibola. 
</P>
<P>
Ulloa found neither. The Santo Tomas sank soon after the voyage began. The 
explorer sailed on, charting the Gulf of California and venturing up the 
western coast of Baja California. With supplies dwindling, the Santa Agueda 
returned to Mexico. Ulloa decided to continue "with the ship Trinidad and these 
few supplies and men, to go on, if God grant me the weather, as far as I can . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
The Trinidad was never heard from again. Lost at sea, wrecked on an unknown 
coast, or attacked by Indians -- for centuries chroniclers had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, an Oceanside physician, Joseph J. Markey, proclaimed the mystery 
solved. Using maps and documents uncovered in a Spanish archive, Markey located 
the skeletal remains of 22 Europeans buried in a cave in the San Luis Rey 
Valley, on the outskirts of Camp Pendleton. The skeletons, along with weapons 
and gold coins, all dated from the era of the Spanish conquest, according to 
Markey. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the San Diego Historical Society on Jan. 25, 1952, Markey 
presented a detailed account of the last days of Francisco Ulloa and his men. 
Based upon his archeological evidence and Spanish documents -- including a 
mysterious diary written by a Trinidad survivor -- Markey described how Ulloa 
had anchored the galleon in the mouth of the San Luis Rey River on Aug. 21, 
1540. Ill with scurvy, most of the crew abandoned the ship and camped inland 
near an Indian village by a freshwater lake. Soon the Spaniards, "lacking the 
immunity built up over the centuries by the Indians," succumbed to dysentery 
contracted from the polluted waters of the lake. Ulloa himself died on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Three crewmen from the Trinidad, including the diarist, Pablo Salvador 
Hernandez, escaped by rowing the ship's longboat to Acapulco. Abandoned, the 
Trinidad sank somewhere near Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Did Francisco de Ulloa actually arrive in California in 1540, predating Juan 
Rodriguez Cabrillo by two years? Could the wreck of the Trinidad be found, and 
would it contain, as Markey believed, several million dollars worth of gold? 
</P>
<P>
The public and news media greeted the story with enthusiasm. Trumpeted by 
Markey, the story reached a wide audience. 
</P>
<P>
Less vocal than Markey were a few skeptics. In a letter to the San Diego 
Historical Society that year, Museum of Man Curator Spencer L. Rogers told 
Curator John Davidson that Markey's theories were at "sharp variance with known 
scientific facts," and warned, "I look with alarm upon the fact that your 
institution and society would seem to be giving implied support to this 
gentleman's theories." 
</P>
<P>
A more specific challenge to Markey's theory came in 1971 from a professor of 
history, David Weber of San Diego State University. Weber pointed out that 
Spanish manuscripts interpreted in the 1930s clearly placed the explorer Ulloa 
in Mexico one year after his alleged death at San Luis Rey. Spanish court 
records also show Ulloa testifying in a trial in Valladolid, Spain, in 1542. 
</P>
<P>
If Ulloa and the Trinidad had returned safely to Mexico, what had Markey 
actually found in his cave at San Luis Rey? Ralph Heiser, former museum curator 
at Mission San Luis Rey suggested the skeletal remains were ape skulls and the 
gold coins "common Spanish coins . . . made of copper and tin." 
</P>
<P>
Markey's archival evidence -- the Hernandez maps and diary -- were unavailable 
for examination. In response to his critics, the doctor explained that a 
forthcoming book would include photographs of the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicions of Markey's theory failed to discourage seekers of the lost 
Trinidad. Markey himself ignored the doubters and turned treasure hunter. 
Believing the galleon must have sunk somewhere near the San Luis Rey River, he 
began launching rafts in the river loaded with tons of scrap iron. By noting 
where the rafts sank, Markey hoped to locate the logical burial spot of the 
Trinidad. Unfortunately, the rafts foundered erratically in a wide area. After 
three years of raft building, Markey gave up. 
</P>
<P>
More determined treasure seekers joined the hunt. A group of professional 
divers called "Aztec Six" searched without success for several months in 1968. 
The next year, diver Bill Takasato claimed to have found a wreck buried in sand 
only a few hundred hards from shore. Bad weather and equipment failures forced 
Takasato to abandon the search. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, salvagers financed by a Wilmington yacht broker claimed discovery of 
the wreck. Again, equipment problems were blamed for stopping the work. 
Treasure hunters were back in 1976. A nightclub singer named Bill Warren found 
"a couple of cannons down there" with the aid of a $7,000 metal detector. As 
late as 1987, Warren was still trying to get adequate financing to continue his 
quest. 
</P>
<P>
Markey died in 1985. His promised book documenting the famous Hernandez diary 
and maps never appeared. No one ever saw his documents or the skeletons he 
found to study them. 
</P>
<P>
For all the thousands of dollars and immeasurable hours spent searching for the 
treasure of the Trinidad, perhaps the most remarkable fact of all is that 
Markey's theories have been so widely believed in the first place. An "artfully 
contrived hoax," concluded curator Ralph Heiser. A hoax, it might be added, 
that has captivated the public for more than four decades.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: GOOD FOR YOU -- BUT NOT ALWAYS GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Slender folk hardly seem to need a refuge -- they claimed the high ground years 
ago and have been applauded ever since by the fashion press and the medical 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, a chain of restaurants called Skinny Haven has been around for 20 
years, although these places do not seem to exist exclusively for the slim. A 
quick glance around during a recent visit to the Oceanside Skinny Haven turned 
up some thin people, but also a number of chunky ones; the majority, like most 
of us, were simply kind of lumpy. 
</P>
<P>
Skinny Haven calls itself "The Healthy Place" and offers several items prepared 
according to the guidelines of the American Heart Assn.'s "Eating Away From 
Home" program. The restaurant says that all of these dishes -- indeed, the 
entire menu -- are low in sodium, cholesterol, fat and sugar. The selection of 
AHA approved plates includes a baked potato stuffed with cheese and veal chili 
with beans; stir-fries of vegetables or chicken; fettuccine "Alfredo" (this 
sauce might set Rome's long-deceased Alfredo spinning) and boneless short ribs 
in barbecue sauce. A calorie count follows each and every listing, and most 
items on the dinner menu weigh in under 400.

A menu note says that Skinny Haven recipes are "good for you" and that may be 
true, but, upon reading the menu for the first time, diners accustomed to 
eateries where beef, butter and French fries are bywords may regard "good for 
you" in the same way that Victorian children did when mama proffered a spoon of 
castor oil. The restaurant's coral and turquoise color scheme is bright and 
cheerful, but a sort of monastic quiet reigned one recent evening and 
underscored the mood of ascetic self-denial that seems part and parcel of the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Some would find the Skinny Haven habit easier to acquire than others, since the 
cooking and quality can be uneven. For example, the salad bar recently 
displayed a good selection of vegetables and garnishes, but the mixed greens 
offered as the base were tired and in many cases brown. A forkful of the rice 
pilaf served with one dish made the point that a second taste was not 
necessary. The steamed vegetables that accompanied another entree included not 
only decent, if thoroughly unseasoned, carrots and zucchini, but broccoli so 
past its prime that a guest put down her fork and exclaimed, "This is awful!" 
And, at a place like this, it would seem that lettuce and broccoli would get 
priority treatment. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, the teriyaki chicken breasts were surprisingly tender and the 
dark-amber sauce smooth and sweet. A plate of veal knackwurst with sauerkraut 
similarly was a happy experience, the sausage nicely spiced and the kraut 
puckery and tart, just as it should have been. Like many entrees, these were 
available in 4-, 6- and 8-ounce portions, with $1 added to the base price for 
each two-ounce increment. Chicken entrees generally cost $7.75; the knackwurst, 
the vegetable quiche and the simpler pastas cost $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
Among other entree offerings are spinach-cheese manicotti; seafood or ham 
fettuccine; taco salad; chile relleno; chicken and tuna salad croissant 
sandwiches, and fish filets seasoned with lemon pepper or Cajun spices. 
</P>
<P>
Wine is not available but desserts, oddly enough, get much play; there is even 
a Skinny Haven Dessert Club that rewards the purchaser of 12 desserts in one 
month with a free sundae. Desserts are based on Skinny Delicious Soft Serve, a 
low-fat milk frozen confection that is offered by itself, in sundaes and a 
banana split and with cakes. This and other products are available for takeout 
purchase in the restaurant's lobby.

SOVIET CITIZENS WORRY ABOUT UNITED GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sits down to begin negotiations with 
President Bush today he will be representing Soviet citizens who now regard the 
United States as only a small threat but are very nervous about Germany's 
unification, The Los Angeles Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet people emphatically back Gorbachev's insistence, expected to be 
reiterated in the summit talks, that the new Germany not be a military partner 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps complicating his posture on another sensitive summit topic, the 
Soviet leader seems slightly out of step with his own people regarding 
secession efforts by the three Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 
Soviet citizens tend to be more tolerant than the Kremlin of the drive for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the survey of Soviet citizens found a strong undercurrent of 
restiveness about Gorbachev's domestic programs, even though the people do have 
a high personal regard for their leader. 
</P>
<P>
Nine in 10 of those interviewed said there are "major difficulties" with 
perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program. And these were their answers before 
last week's frantic buying spree that was sparked by the government's 
announcement that, as part of its efforts to introduce a market economy, it 
intends to sharply raise consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet citizens were being interviewed, The Times Poll also was surveying 
Americans for their opinions on the same questions. 
</P>
<P>
Americans tend to see the Soviet Union as more of a military threat than the 
Soviet people do the United States, the poll found. But, somewhat 
paradoxically, they also have a rosier view of current U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the Soviet people, not surprisingly, most Americans agree with 
the Bush Administration that a unified Germany should be a full member of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Questions for the surveys in both countries were written by The Times Poll. In 
the Soviet Union, door-to-door interviews of 1,485 people were conducted May 
9-24 by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Those interviewed were 
selected randomly from the complete list of internal "passport" holders. All 
Soviet citizens age 16 and older are required to carry these passports as 
identification papers. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, The Times Poll interviewed 2,144 Americans by telephone 
from May 10-14. The phone numbers were randomly selected by computer. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for both surveys is three percentage points in either 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Houston cooperated in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We conducted the poll because we thought it would be interesting to find out 
what the Soviet people think about events in their own country and in the 
world," Times Poll Director I.A. Lewis said. "And until now we haven't had an 
opportunity to find out. It was difficult technically and, more importantly, it 
was impossible politically before glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
Even with glasnost, the policy of openness instituted by Gorbachev, the 
majority of Soviet citizens who were interviewed acknowledged that "some might 
want to be careful about how they respond" to the poll questions. Less than a 
third said that people would "feel perfectly free to express their personal 
opinions." 
</P>
<P>
Americans were a lot more cynical about the degree of Soviet candor. Nine in 10 
felt the Soviet respondents would answer the poll questions cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
But it was clear from the interviews on each side that citizens of both the 
United States and the Soviet Union no longer regard the other nation as their 
mortal enemy. Two-thirds of Americans now believe the two military superpowers 
are "friendly." So do a majority of Soviet citizens. This represents a big 
turnaround for Americans since Gorbachev first took power five years ago, when 
only a quarter of U.S. citizens thought the two nations were friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Americans nor Soviet citizens are yet willing to believe that the Cold 
War is history. Roughly half the people in each country think it continues. 
Still, four in 10 Soviet citizens believe that the United States "wants to live 
peacefully with the rest of the world" and a majority of Americans think the 
same of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the Soviet people regard the United States as only a "small 
threat" militarily, and a majority of Americans feel the same about the Soviet 
Union. But U.S. fears appear to run deeper, as those Americans who feel that 
the other nation represents "a large threat" outnumber by 2 1/2 times those in 
the Soviet Union who feel that way about the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger concern now in the Soviet Union seems to be what will happen to Europe 
after West and East Germany unify. In fighting Germany's Nazi regime in World 
War II, 27 million Soviet citizens died. And although half the Soviets 
interviewed in this survey favor German unification, about that many also said 
they "would be worried" if the new Germany became "the dominant power in 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Among those Soviets who would worry about a dominant Germany, the vast majority 
said they would fear the new German state's "trying to expand its territory 
again" and its economy becoming "too strong." But most of all -- and 83% cited 
this -- they would worry about "a revival of Nazism." 
</P>
<P>
Americans expressed similar concerns, although more people -- two-thirds -- 
favored German unification. And only a third said they would worry about the 
new Germany becoming Europe's "dominant power." 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the Soviet citizens want a unified Germany to be militarily 
neutral, according to The Times survey. Only one in 20 favor its joining the 
NATO military alliance, a response that represents strong support for 
Gorbachev's position. In the United States, Bush's opposite position that the 
new Germany should be a full NATO member is backed by a majority of people. 
Less than a third believe it should be neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet citizens are not concerned generally about the breakup of the Soviet 
Bloc in Eastern Europe, the survey indicated. Two-thirds said it is "good that 
the Eastern European countries have now become independent." 
</P>
<P>
And as far as the Baltic republics are concerned, people in the Soviet Union 
agree by 4 to 3 that they should be "allowed to leave the Soviet Union." This 
puts a significant proportion of Soviet citizens at odds with Gorbachev, who 
has been resisting the independence drives, at least on any terms other than 
those laid out in the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Soviet citizens who approve of secession, the dominant feeling is 
that the republics should be allowed to break away if their citizens vote to 
leave. In that case, the new autonomous states should be responsible for 
conducting their own foreign policy and providing for their own defense, those 
surveyed said. But they also should "satisfy (the) economic demands" from 
Moscow for repayment of capital investments resulting from their membership in 
the Soviet Union, the people said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Soviet citizens who oppose allowing the republics to secede at will, 
the thought is that negotiations should be held with Moscow "until a decision 
is reached." But even these people object to applying "economic pressure" on an 
independence-minded republic, as Gorbachev has done to Lithuania. And 
three-fourths disagree with the notion of "using military force to keep a 
republic from leaving the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
But Soviet citizens also feel a good deal of nationalistic pride about this 
issue: They basically believe that the republics are their business -- and not 
the United States'. By 3 to 2, they say that Bush's warnings to Gorbachev about 
the dire consequences to U.S.-Soviet relations of using military force in 
Lithuania amounts to "unjustified meddling in the Soviet Union's internal 
affairs" rather than "the justified concern of a democratic country for the 
rights of the Lithuanian people." 
</P>
<P>
And the American people also seem to be sensitive to this attitude. When asked 
whether Bush "should speak out in favor of Lithuania . . . even if it might 
damage relations with the Soviet Union" or whether the President "should 
continue to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union even if (it) might 
indicate less support for the people of Lithuania," by 3 to 2 they vote for 
keeping on good terms with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Soviet citizens approve of Gorbachev's handling of the Lithuania 
situation by 3 to 2. And Americans approve of Bush's handling of it by 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
American and Soviet citizens generally have about the same regard for their own 
leaders. Roughly 7 in 10 in each country approve of the way their presidents 
are handling their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, both Gorbachev and Bush elicit favorable impressions from 
two-thirds of the people. In the United States, Americans have a slightly 
higher impression of Bush than Gorbachev, but both men are very highly 
regarded. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Americans have no opinion about whether the summit will be a 
success or failure. But two-thirds of the Soviet citizens are confident it will 
be successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Americans and Soviets View the Summit 
</P>
<P>
Recently, The Times surveyed 1,485 Soviets living in European Russia and asked 
several questions regarding the Washington summit. In addition 2,144 Americans 
were asked the same questions. The survey occurred between May 9-24.

GORBACHEV, S. KOREA'S ROH TO CONFER IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>

In an unprecedented event that will dramatize the far-reaching changes taking 
place among the nations of East Asia, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
will meet with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo in San Francisco, U.S. 
officials and other sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II, the Soviet 
Union has served as a military supplier and patron of the North Korean regime 
of Kim Il Sung, while South Korea has remained a close ally of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinary event," observed one exultant U.S. official 
Wednesday. "Can you see the poor guy in Pyongyang who draws the short straw and 
has to tell the old man (North Korean leader Kim) about this?" 
</P>
<P>
Kim met with Gorbachev in Moscow in 1986. The Soviets have no diplomatic 
relations with South Korea, and the heads of state of the two nations have 
never met. 
</P>
<P>
Although the session has not yet been officially announced by the two 
countries, the U.S. officials and other sources Wednesday confirmed it. Both 
leaders are scheduled to arrive in the Bay Area on Sunday. South Korean 
officials had been suggesting since April that Roh might come to the United 
States to see Gorbachev either before or after the Soviet leader's summit 
meeting with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's meeting with Roh would be the culmination of a series of steps that 
the Soviet Union has taken over the last year to improve relations with South 
Korea. The two countries opened trade and consular offices last year, and in 
March, Gorbachev met in Moscow with Kim Young Sam, one of the leaders of South 
Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea has reacted furiously to the unfolding development of ties. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union, a friend of our people, must not go to the length of 
becoming a friend of the enemy of our people," warned the official North Korean 
news agency after Gorbachev met with Kim Young Sam. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's primary motivation is economic -- to attract the capital, 
technology, labor and other help that South Korea might provide. 
</P>
<P>
"The South Koreans could be important to the development of Siberia," said 
Ralph N. Clough of Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International 
Studies. "For example, the South Koreans are strong in construction. Their 
workers have been all over the Middle East and they could work on construction 
projects for the Soviets. The South Koreans have less expensive consumer goods 
than the Japanese, too." 
</P>
<P>
Further, other experts say, Gorbachev may be seeking to develop ties with Seoul 
as a way of goading Japan into moving faster in upgrading its own ties with the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev's willingness to do this says that while the Soviets still attach 
some importance to the relationship with North Korea, they have other interests 
to pursue in South Korea, and may even be applying some pressure on other 
nations in the region, such as Japan, which may be lagging in the development 
of Soviet ties," said Alan D. Romberg, a Korea specialist at the Council on 
Foreign Relations. 
</P>
<P>
For Roh, the meeting with Gorbachev would represent a major step forward in 
what is often called his foreign policy of nordpolitik -- of improving ties 
with countries to the north and west, including the Soviet Union, China and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last four decades, Kim Il Sung's Communist regime in Pyongyang has 
sought to maintain close ties with both the Soviet Union and China, apparently 
in an effort to avoid too great a dependence on either one of its huge 
neighbors. Over the last year, North Korea has drawn much closer to China, and 
Gorbachev's meeting with the South Korean president could further this process. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the two leaders will meet in the United States because ties 
between Moscow and Seoul have not yet advanced to the point where Gorbachev 
could stop to see Roh in Seoul. "I don't think they're quite at the stage yet 
where they could have presidential visits back and forth. They don't have 
diplomatic ties yet," Clough said. But he said it is possible that South Korea 
and the Soviet Union could establish diplomatic relations by the end of this 
year.

U.S. REJECTS STATE PRODUCE RESTRICTIONS

Florida's petition to restrict California produce was shot down Wednesday by 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said that California's efforts to 
contain the Medfly are ensuring the purity of state-grown fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's petition could be reconsidered within 30 days. But barring a major 
new outbreak of the Mediterranean fruit fly in California, the federal 
government will "leave things the way they are now, because California is 
beating the Medfly," a spokesman for the department's Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service said. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting Florida's petition to have all California produce be inspected and 
certified free of Medfly larvae, the Department of Agriculture noted that no 
Medfly has been caught since May 1 in any of California's more than 35,000 
traps deployed in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The policies outlined in Florida's petition, if ordered by the Department of 
Agriculture, would have profoundly wounded California's multibillion-dollar 
farm economy, much of which lies outside the areas where Medflies have been 
caught. In addition to asking special inspection and certification, Florida 
agriculture officials had asked the federal government to make California enact 
tougher and broader Medfly eradication efforts -- to deploy more traps 
statewide and spray malathion more often and over a wider area. 
</P>
<P>
Florida, which is California's main rival in citrus and other Sun Belt crops, 
has suffered from its own Medfly epidemic this year, and links its recurrent 
pest problems to the import of California produce. 
</P>
<P>
The crop-consuming insect attacked both California and Florida farms in 1981, 
appearing first in California. Florida and four other states then tried to bar 
California produce, but California successfully sued to overturn Florida's 
attempted quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Doyle Conner, Florida's commissioner of agriculture, argued in 
announcing the petition that Californian Medflies are "widely distributed" and 
present "a very real and serious threat of being moved to Florida and other 
Southern states by way of infested host fruits and vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," Conner said, "strict and encompassing quarantine regulations must 
be imposed in California to protect other areas of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Florida officials maintain that the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture deploys too few Medfly traps to know the magnitude of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 26, when the first of 19 Medflies was caught in Southern California, 
the state has installed about 30 traps per square mile within the federally 
declared Medfly quarantine area, which embraces about 1,300 square miles of the 
Los Angeles Basin. But in the rest of the state -- where no Medflies have been 
caught -- the department places five traps per square mile in urban areas and 
one trap per square mile in harvest areas. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials in Florida's Dade County, responding to the capture of 23 
Medflies in a 15-square-mile area there in recent months, have mounted a strong 
anti-Medfly campaign involving the placement of 10 traps per square mile and 
spraying malathion three to four times in threatened areas before introducing 
sterile male Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Hiherd, assistant director of the Florida Department of Agriculture's 
division of plant industry, said the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture should do the same. She criticized the California eradication 
effort for taking "shortcuts," such as spraying areas only once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Their detection efforts are not adequate. The program there is not following 
the advice of its advisers," Hiherd said. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of high-ranking state agriculture officials on the National Plant 
Board Advisory Council were not persuaded by the appeal from the Florida 
representative. Members representing California, New Jersey, Maryland, 
Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Alabama and Oregon were involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Florida was the only state within the panel making a strong pitch for the 
petition," said Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the California Department 
of Food and Agriculture, the state's representative to the advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said Florida's proposal would have cost California taxpayers "hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in unnecessary measures to regulate millions of tons of 
fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Florida agriculture officials vowed to push again for the measure, particularly 
if more Medflies turn up next month in California traps.

DIPLOMACY: RAISA'S PLANNED STOP AT FISHERMAN'S WHARF IS SEEN AS DECLASSE.

<P>
The excitement surrounding Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's upcoming 
visit here was tempered Wednesday with the release of his wife's itinerary and 
news that the Gorbachevs hope to visit the Golden Gate Bridge -- at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure security, Golden Gate Bridge officials and the California Highway 
Patrol plan to slow traffic on the heavily traveled bridge while the Gorbachevs 
and their 30-car motorcade make their way across, sometime between 4 p.m. and 7 
p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that afternoon, Raisa Gorbachev is tentatively scheduled to go on an 
hour-long tour of the city, viewing some of San Francisco's finest sights and 
some of its most blighted and tacky. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about abominations," one San Francisco native involved in the planning 
sniffed upon hearing that Raisa Gorbachev will visit touristy Fisherman's 
Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
The itinerary released by PBN Co., the San Francisco public relations firm that 
is coordinating aspects of the visit, shows that her entourage apparently will 
bypass such monuments to Western consumerism as Union Square. 
</P>
<P>
"I. Magnin said at one point they would close the entire store if she wanted to 
shop there. But she's not going to (Nordstrom). She's not going to go to I. 
Magnin," said Staci Walters of PBN. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the morning with her husband at Stanford University, Mrs. 
Gorbachev will take her tour. She probably will be escorted by Tatyana Kamenev, 
wife of the Soviet consul general, and perhaps Sherry Agnos, wife of Mayor Art 
Agnos, said Charlotte Mailliard Swig, San Francisco's chief of protocol.

"They won't have much time, but I think she'll like it and come back," Swig 
said. "I just hope they don't stop in Civic Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
Her itinerary will include a trip to Golden Gate Park, perhaps a stop at a 
museum, and a visit to Civic Center, locale of San Francisco's ornate City Hall 
and home to hundreds of homeless people who camp in the plaza there. San 
Francisco has been sprucing up the plaza in recent months, but does not plan to 
relocate the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of life," Art Silverman, spokesman for Mayor Agnos, said of the 
tent dwellers in the plaza outside City Hall. "It is our own glasnost policy, 
you might say. We're not going to try to hide anything." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said Warden Coleman, 33, who has been living in the plaza 
for three months with his dog, Lady. The out-of-work bartender put down his 
book -- a spy novel -- and pointed out that if Mrs. Gorbachev drives by or 
stops at the plaza, "she'll get to see that her country isn't the only one 
having trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The tentative schedule also has Mrs. Gorbachev heading to the heart of the 
city's financial district, stopping at the 52-story Bank of America building, 
then going on to Fisherman's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
While she tours San Francisco, her husband is scheduled to speak to business 
and political leaders at the Fairmont Hotel. San Francisco police spokesman 
David Ambrose said he expects that the largest demonstration of the Soviets' 
West Coast stop will take place outside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California representatives of ethnic Armenian, Latvian, Estonian and 
Lithuanian groups said several busloads of demonstrators will arrive Monday 
from such locales as Los Angeles, Santa Ana and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be a shortage of Baltic flags flying around," said Jaak Treiman, a 
Los Angeles attorney of Estonian extraction. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fairmont, Gorbachev reportedly is planning to acknowledge Gov. George 
Deukmejian's relief efforts on behalf of victims of the Armenian earthquake in 
1988. Deukmejian, who is of Armenian descent, has said he does not know if he 
will have a chance to speak privately with the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
If given the opportunity, the governor added, he will tell Gorbachev that 
Armenians in the United States "hope Mr. Gorbachev and his government would 
take steps to ensure greater protection for Armenian people living there, and 
greater assistance to help them to rebuild from the devastating earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
After the Fairmont speech, Gorbachev will return to the Soviet consul general's 
home, meet with his wife, and head to the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Bill Wylie, spokesman for the CHP in Marin County, said the Gorbachevs 
tentatively plan to cross the bridge and get out of their cars at the vista 
point on the Marin side. After gazing upon the San Francisco skyline for about 
15 minutes, they will return to their cars for the drive to San Francisco and 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy that he's coming to view our area and our bridge," Wylie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But feelings of peace and goodwill aside, the sightseeing excursion is likely 
to take its toll on the Monday evening commute across the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie said at the minimum, the CHP will slow traffic, and "they could shut down 
the bridge for a minute," while Gorbachev and his entourage cross the span. At 
rush hour, 6,000 cars an hour head north from San Francisco to Marin across the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the motorcade itself will impact traffic as much as people 
wanting to get a view of the President of the Soviet Union," Wylie said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Gate Bridge officials say the 25-minute operation -- 15 minutes at the 
vista point and 10 minutes for the round-trip drive -- will not result in 
gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this area stay clear when they know there's going to be a major 
event. They go home early or they stay late," said Carney Campion, manager of 
the bridge.

RARE DEFECTS IN FETUSES FIXED BY NEW SURGERY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: SAN FRANCISCO DOCTORS PARTIALLY REMOVED THE BABIES FROM THE UTERUS, 
REARRANGED THE INTERNAL ORGANS AND MADE REPAIRS.

<P>
UC San Francisco doctors announced Wednesday that they have successfully 
performed surgery to correct a rare, serious birth defect in two fetuses, 
allowing them to develop into normal, healthy babies. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, a team of UC San Francisco surgeons proudly 
displayed the two babies -- a 9-month old boy and a 6-week-old girl -- who had 
the operation, which involves correcting a hole in the diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSF team has performed the highly experimental repair surgery eight times. 
The first six fetuses died, four during the operation and two others from 
complications after birth. 
</P>
<P>
UCSF is pioneering the surgical technique, which involves partially removing 
the fetus from the uterus, rearranging its internal organs and returning it to 
the mother's womb. The first of the two operations is reported in today's New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed to correct fetal diaphragmatic hernia, a severe birth 
defect that occurs in about one of every 2,000 babies. 
</P>
<P>
The diaphragm is a key respiratory muscle that separates the lung cavity from 
the abdomen. In fetuses with this defect, a hole in the diaphragm fails to grow 
shut, and the stomach, intestines and other organs squeeze into the chest 
cavity. As a result, the lungs fail to develop, and the baby is born unable to 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of all babies with this defect die either at or before birth. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wait to operate on newborn babies to correct the hole in the diaphragm, 
they often die anyway," said Dr. Michael R. Harrison, who developed the surgery 
as co-director of the UCSF Fetal Treatment Program. "It is heartbreaking. The 
baby's lung, compressed by other organs throughout the fetal development, is 
simply too small to support life outside the womb." 
</P>
<P>
The two most recent babies to have the operation went on to become healthy 
children, Harrison said, proudly holding up a rambunctious baby boy, Blake 
Schultz of Chelsea, Mich. "He's our hero." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison and the team's other doctors described how one year ago they performed 
the surgery that allowed the baby to breathe normally. During the surgery, 
doctors cut into the mother's uterus and pulled the fetus's arm out through the 
hole. Wires were attached to the fetus to monitor its heart and oxygen levels. 
</P>
<P>
Through an incision in the fetus, they put the misplaced stomach, intestines 
and other organs back where they belonged and covered the hole in the diaphragm 
with a patch made of the synthetic material Gore-Tex. Finally they tucked the 
fetus's arm back into the womb and closed the incision. 
</P>
<P>
Blake was premature and had to spend a month on a respirator, but was healthy 
at 8 months. The second successful operation was performed March 3 on Devona 
Anderson of Tacoma, Wash. Although operated on at 25 weeks, she was able to 
breathe on her own on her second day of life. 
</P>
<P>
Both sets of parents discussed their experiences Wednesday, describing their 
apprehension about the experimental operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared. I had never had surgery for any reason before," said Beth 
Schultz. "I didn't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Scott, mother of Devona Anderson, agreed. "I was concerned about losing 
the baby -- it was scary." But her husband, Stephen, gestured to his sleeping 
daughter and added: "It was the only chance she had." 
</P>
<P>
The operation takes just under an hour and costs about $18,000, Harrison said. 
But insurance companies are reluctant to pay for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors conceded that a major difficulty is separating those fetuses that 
are likely to survive from those that are doomed, since the operation itself is 
highly dangerous to the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to learn how to select for treatment only the fetuses who really needed 
it," Harrison said 
</P>
<P>
"All this is made possible by advances in prenatal diagnosis, imaging and 
intervention techniques," added Dr. Mitchell Globus, a UCSF obstetrician and 
co-director of the team 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have experimented for the last decade with treating and repairing 
defective fetuses before birth. Most interventions have been relatively minor, 
however. Among the most common is opening up urinary blockages. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said he has been working on the latest procedure for about 12 years. 
His team tested it on 1,000 fetal lambs and 200 fetal monkeys. They also 
reviewed 200 fetuses in which the disorder was not treated before birth.

Last-minute money woes Wednesday prompted the campaign to win voter approval of 
a gasoline tax increase to cancel major television advertising planned for key 
markets in the final days before the June 5 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign insiders said the money shortage is so serious that some markets would 
be "black," meaning no television advertisements from the Yes on Propositions 
111 and 108 camp would be aired. They said they did not know yet which markets 
these would be. 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Thomas W. Hiltachk said fund raising in the last few days has 
steadily fallen short of the goals set by the campaign, which had hoped to 
bring its total collections to $5.9 million before the closing stretch of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who is heading the campaign, has put his reputation on 
the line to win the tax increase. Hiltachk said that from the beginning, the 
governor has insisted that the effort not end up with a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really tight," one campaign supporter said. "We're getting checks for 
$5,000 and $10,000 when we need them to be $25,000 and $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign consultants tried to put the best light on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"County registrars around the state tell us they have been receiving record 
numbers of absentee ballot requests. They have also been telling us that there 
could be a record low turnout at the polling places on Election Day. With that 
in mind, we are focusing our messages on the high propensity voters during the 
few remaining days of the campaign and we believe those voters can best be 
reached through an increased emphasis on direct mail and radio," the campaign's 
Burlingame-based consultants, Woodward-McDowell said in a formal statement. 
</P>
<P>
The phased-in, 9-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase would help finance a 10-year, 
$18.5-billion transportation improvement and congestion relief program. The tax 
increase can go into effect, however, only if voters approve Proposition 111, a 
ballot measure that modifies the state's spending limit. Proposition 108 would 
authorize $1 billion of the new transportation funds in bonds to pay for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
"The final ads are crucial to our strategy," campaign news director Bob Schmidt 
said. "From day one the strategy has been to localize the campaign and tell, 
'Here's what your dollars will mean to you in your neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has designed five different ads for specific regions of the state 
-- Los Angeles, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento and rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Some stations were paid through Tuesday," said one official. "Those that 
weren't are going to get calls that we have caneled."

U.S., GREECE SIGN PACT ON MILITARY BASES;

<P>
After years of bitter disputes and tough negotiations, the United States and 
Greece signed a new defense agreement Wednesday allowing American bases to stay 
in the eastern Mediterranean country. 
</P>
<P>
The major installations covered by the agreement are a U.S. Air Force base and 
a Navy base on the island of Crete and about 20 smaller installations spread 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
It was a further sign of dramatic improvements in relations since Prime 
Minister Constantine Mitsotakis formed the first Conservative government in 
nine years after an election victory on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan and Greek Ambassador 
Christos Zacharakis on Wednesday morning, officials from both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis said this week the agreement will run for eight years, but after the 
signing, officials declined to give details on the pact. 
</P>
<P>
It replaces the five-year Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement, which 
expired in December, 1988. The Americans had until the end of this year to pack 
up and go home unless a new agreement was signed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the previous defense agreement, Greece received $350 million in military 
aid in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the new accord opened in November, 1987, but were marred by 
angry disputes between the United States and Greece's then-ruling Socialist 
government, which had vowed to close what its supporters called "the bases of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Talks were suspended by the Socialists in May, 1989, after 17 rounds but 
reopened after Mitsotakis won the April election. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were made easier by a U.S. decision this year to shut two bases 
due to budget cuts -- Hellenikon Air Base sharing Athens airport, and Nea Makri 
Naval Communications Station, east of Athens. 
</P>
<P>
The pact must be ratified by Greece's 300-seat Parliament, where Mitsotakis 
controls 151 seats. The U.S. Senate will be informed about the agreement, but 
its approval is not required.

EX-HOSTAGE SENT TO JAIL IN FRANCE IN CUSTODY CASE

Jacqueline Valente, freed in Beirut in April after more than two years as a 
hostage, was sentenced Wednesday to two months in a French prison for taking 
two daughters from her ex-husband in defiance of a custody ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had requested only a one-month suspended sentence during the 
hearing in Toulon, but the presiding judge, Andre Fortin, decided to impose the 
harsher penalty. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Valente, 32, had committed a "premeditated kidnaping" in 1983 and 
expressed irritation that she refused to answer questions about the mysterious 
circumstances of her own abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Valente was allowed to remain free pending an appeal. She was sentenced to six 
months in prison, four of which were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The case dates to August, 1983, when Valente refused to return her daughters -- 
Marie-Laure and Virginie -- to their father after one of their regular visits 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
No word was heard about Valente and the girls until November, 1987, when the 
Revolutionary Council of Fatah -- a Libyan-backed Palestinian group led by 
terrorist Abu Nidal -- declared it had taken them hostage, along with five 
Belgians also aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The two girls were freed in 1988, and Valente, her Belgian companion, Fernand 
Houtekins, and their own daughter, Sophie-Liberte, were freed April 10.

CONTRAS AGREE TO SPEED UP DISARMAMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Contra leaders agreed Wednesday to speed up the stalled process of disarming 
their forces in return for a government-aided relocation plan allowing former 
guerrillas to police their new communities. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third accord in six weeks committing the Nicaraguan rebels, who are 
gathered in seven cease-fire zones, to hand their weapons to U.N. peacekeeping 
troops by June 10. After each previous pact, the rebels have slowed their 
demobilization and won new concessions, leaving about 13,000 rebels still to be 
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"Today our friends in the Resistance have promised to comply with all the 
agreements they have made earlier for June 10," President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro told reporters after all-night talks with Contra military leader 
Israel Galeano and Gen. Humberto Ortega, commander of the Sandinista-led army 
that fought the U.S.-backed rebels for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she believed the rebels' promise this time, the president said: "One 
must have enormous faith." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's latest concessions will give a degree of autonomy to the rural 
resettlement colonies that the rebels had won in a previous agreement. The 
first colonies are to be built in the sparsely-settled southeastern corner of 
Nicaragua, with the government providing roads, housing materials, schools, 
health clinics and farm tools for former rebels and their families. 
</P>
<P>
At the rebels' insistence, the new colonies will be self-governing and policed 
by former rebel combatants. The new policemen are to be trained by U.N. troops 
and accountable to the Ministry of Government in Managua, which oversees the 
national police force. 
</P>
<P>
The policing arrangement was crucial to Contra leaders, who claimed that 
disarmed rebels faced the threat of reprisals by members of the army and 
national police. Both are still led by officers of the Sandinista revolutionary 
movement that lost the Feb. 25 election to Chamorro's center-right coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Since the disarmament process began May 8, just 1,984 rebels have returned as 
civilians to their home towns and villages, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks that produced Wednesday's agreement started last week but were broken 
off Friday in a bizarre sequence of events. Rebel negotiators charged that 14 
disarmed rebels on their way home in northern Nicaragua had died in a 
Sandinista ambush. 
</P>
<P>
But when a team of investigators from the government, the Roman Catholic 
Church, the United Nations and Organization of American States flew to the 
site, they found no evidence of the alleged massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Before the investigators returned to Managua, the Contra negotiators tried to 
leave town but were sequestered in their hotel by the police and staged a brief 
hunger strike. The talks resumed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel leaders' behavior appears to reflect concern over the prospect of 
losing their power. While many rebels say they want to go home, Galeano has 
pressed for the new colonies as a way of keeping his men together as a civilian 
organization. Until the U.S. Congress approved a $300 million aid package for 
Nicaragua last week, the government was unable to go beyond its vague promises 
to set up such colonies.

<P>
In the realm of political advertising, the phrase "free TV" has become the 
rallying cry for a growing number of members of Congress who want to limit the 
enormous cost of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since Senate Democrats and Republicans recently began negotiations on a 
bipartisan bill to reform the nation's political campaign system, the issue of 
television advertising has proven to be the only aspect of the debate on which 
members of both parties can agree. 
</P>
<P>
Television ad costs, which now account for as much as 60% of the total budget 
of a typical congressional election campaign, are viewed by many critics as the 
motivating force behind the frantic quest for contributions. If these costs 
were eliminated, some reason, there would be no need for members of Congress to 
risk compromising themselves to raise millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), one of the most outspoken critics 
of the current campaign finance system, contends that while television 
advertising has driven up the cost of campaigns, it has driven down the level 
of political discourse. He notes that most candidates rely on 30-second 
television ads that exaggerate negative aspects of their opponent's record. 
</P>
<P>
"The 30-second television commercial has become the be-all and end-all of 
political campaigns," Danforth said in a recent Senate floor speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
Free air time for political candidates is by no means a new idea. In fact, free 
radio time was first proposed in 1936 by Frank Knox, the running mate of GOP 
presidential nominee Alf Landon. It has been revived many times since then by a 
variety of experts, most recently by University of Virginia Prof. Larry J. 
Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sabato, the United States is the only major democracy in the 
industrialized world that does not require radio and television stations to 
provide free air time to candidates during elections. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law enacted in 1972, politicians are supposed to be charged the lowest 
rate for television air time. But in reality, they often pay a much higher rate 
than other advertisers to ensure that their ads will not be preempted. 
</P>
<P>
David Bienstock, who buys television time for Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), says 
one 30-second, prime-time political spot in the Los Angeles market can cost as 
much as $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's out of control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposals for Change 
</P>
<P>
The leading Senate proposal for free TV was devised by a bipartisan panel of 
experts who recommended that broadcast stations be required to provide eight 
hours of free political advertising each year. The free time would be divided 
among the major political parties, which would distribute it to all candidates 
in five-minute, 60-second, 30-second and 10-second segments. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill, authored by Danforth, would simply lower the cost of television 
ads by requiring broadcasters to adhere to the intent of existing law. It is 
similar to a proposal by Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) that would give the 
lowest rate only to those who comply with voluntary limits on campaign 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, proponents of public financing for campaigns want the government to 
pay for television ads -- opening the way for government funding of all 
campaign costs in the future. Boren's bill would give each candidate federally 
financed vouchers to purchase TV time, up to 20% of their alloted spending 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth's bill would provide one or more five-minute blocks of free air time 
to candidates on the assumption that they would be forced to deal with issues 
in a positive manner if the available time exceeds 30 seconds. He would also 
discourage negative, attack-style ads by requiring candidates to appear in 
their own commercials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospects 
</P>
<P>
Despite the idea's growing popularity, television advertising for congressional 
candidates is unlikely to become completely free in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Reason: The concept is opposed by the powerful National Assn. of Broadcasters, 
whose members not only contribute heavily to members of Congress, but also are 
in a position to set broadcasting policies affecting politicians. 
</P>
<P>
What is expected to emerge is a negotiated agreement between broadcasters and 
congressional leaders providing some reduction in current rates for political 
advertising. In fact, even if Congress does not pass an overall campaign reform 
bill this year, experts say, it is possible that legislation governing 
television ads will be enacted anyway.

<TEXT>
<P>
Arab leaders on Wednesday condemned the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel and 
the suppression of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, 
declaring the United States "primarily responsible" by giving the Israeli 
government the means to carry out its policies. 
</P>
<P>
Winding up a three-day emergency meeting of the Arab League, host Iraq and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization drove the delegates to produce a communique 
long on hard-line rhetoric but lacking in firm plans for action. 
</P>
<P>
The document accused the Israeli leadership of promoting policies of 
"aggression, terrorism and expansionism" in the West Bank and Gaza, and it 
declared that Jewish settlements in the territories constitute "a great danger 
to the Arab nation and an impudent violation of human rights." 
</P>
<P>
"The conference holds the United States primarily responsible for this, as it 
provides Israel with the military means, financial help and political cover 
without which it could not pursue these policies and defy so arrogantly the 
will of the international community," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
Singling out the prospect of Soviet Jewish immigrants settling in the occupied 
territories, the 20-page communique -- hammered out in five closed-door 
sessions since Monday -- said that Arab nations will review their relations 
with countries that support the immigration program. 
</P>
<P>
The rebuke to the United States marked a reversal for moderates, led by Egypt 
and Saudi Arabia, who came to Baghdad determined to avoid confrontational 
language in the communique. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's sponsorship of a proposal to make the Middle East free from nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons was rejected, while Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein won support for his insistence that Arab nations have the right to 
state-of-the-art weapons "to protect their security and sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who corralled the summit as a platform for his pan-Arab political 
ambitions, set the tone with a tough address to the opening session Monday 
night. He denounced U.S. support of the Israeli government, referring at one 
point to "imperialist America" and declaring, "As Arabs, we are the targets of 
these American policies, in the core of our security and interests." 
</P>
<P>
He repeated his vow to retaliate with "whatever weapons of total destruction we 
have" if Israel attacks Iraqi targets with nuclear or chemical weapons. Western 
diplomats here say Hussein appears convinced such an attack is possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the focus of the final document centered on the issue of Soviet emigration 
and the intifada, or Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. The Arab 
leaders pledged to support the uprising financially and politically, and they 
responded to a call from Jordan's King Hussein for aid as a front-line state 
against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
No specific figures were announced, and pledges at past Arab summits have 
failed to be sustained, PLO and Jordanian officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate camp was successful in tempering language proposed by Arab League 
foreign ministers that suggested some sort of economic sanctions against 
countries aiding or supporting the immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, which 
an Israeli official said last week could increase to 20,000 a month later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wrangling between hard-liners and moderates, including the Egyptian 
attempts to persuade the conference to go easy on the Americans and talk peace 
instead of confrontation, there was unity in the criticism of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem of this summit is not differences between Arabs," a member of 
the Egyptian delegation said during a break in the working sessions. "The real 
prob lem is the intransigence of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
In other resolutions, the communique called for: 
</P>
<P>
Political and economic sanctions against any country that recognizes Jerusalem 
as the capital of Israel. It sharply criticized resolutions adopted by the U.S. 
Senate and House of Representatives supporting recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Middle East peace efforts to be carried out in the forum of an international 
conference, as opposed to the stalled step-by-step negotiations favored by the 
Israelis and supported by Washington. The communique, in discussing the peace 
process, made no mention of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which support trading 
land for peace and implicitly recognize the Israeli state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Arab nations attending the Arab League summit in Baghdad are committed, by the 
final communique, to reviewing their relations with countries that support the 
settling of Soviet Jews in Israel. Those attending also pledged to provide both 
financial and political support for the Palestinian uprising in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as aid to Jordan. But no 
figures were announced.

2 SIDES SET TO RATIFY '70S NUCLEAR TREATIES; 
</P>
<P>
ARMS CONTROL: YEARS LATER, TWO AGREEMENTS TO LIMIT UNDERGROUND TESTING WILL 
FINALLY TAKE EFFECT. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the longest-running sagas in arms control history, President Bush and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will sign protocols this week 
implementing two nuclear-test treaties reached a decade and a half ago but 
never ratified into law. 
</P>
<P>
Taking up only two pages, the treaties limit underground nuclear tests for both 
military and non-military purposes and have been honored by both nations even 
though the final details were not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But the protocols to implement them fill 220 pages each, an indication of the 
technical and political issues that have bedeviled superpower efforts to curb 
nuclear tests since the treaties were signed in 1974 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
And while approval of the two protocols probably will assure ratification of 
the treaties, the United States and Soviet Union remain at odds over what comes 
next. Moscow wants to ban nuclear tests totally, rather than just limit them. 
But Washington insists that some testing will be necessary as long as nuclear 
weapons are required for deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear testing was the subject of the first U.S.-Soviet arms agreement in 
1963. Responding to an international clamor to halt aboveground tests that 
rained radioactive fallout around the globe, the two nations agreed to ban 
tests in the air, in water and, later, in outer space. 
</P>
<P>
The United States at the time was also prepared to limit tests underground but 
demanded on-site inspection to make up for the inadequacies of monitoring tests 
from distant seismic stations. Seismic waves from test blasts are hard to 
distinguish from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets objected, saying that they feared the on-site inspectors would 
be spies. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade passed before the Threshold Test Ban Treaty was signed in 
1974. It limits underground nuclear weapon tests to 150 kilotons, or the 
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the 150-kiloton limit was extended to non-military nuclear blasts, for 
such purposes as excavating canals or developing petroleum deposits, in the 
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard M. Nixon resigned as President before he could submit the 1974 
treaty for Senate approval. Gerald R. Ford declined to send forward either 
treaty after he came under conservative attack from Ronald Reagan in the 1976 
GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, wanted to leapfrog both treaties by negotiating 
a comprehensive test ban forbidding all nuclear weapon tests. But when the 
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the old agreements, as well as the new 
negotiations, were put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
As President, Reagan accused the Soviets of "probably" cheating on the 1974 and 
1976 agreements. He insisted on stiffer verification safeguards, including 
on-site inspections, before he would submit the treaties for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Most specialists dispute the cheating charge, attributing it to Reagan's 
political suspicions and to technical errors in monitoring seismic signals. But 
the Soviets eventually agreed to new talks in 1987, on condition that -- upon 
ratification of the old treaties -- talks would begin to further limit 
underground tests with the ultimate goal of banning them. 
</P>
<P>
The principal dispute in the protocol negotiations was how best to measure the 
size of a test explosion. The Soviets insisted that seismic instruments 
implanted on or near the test site were sufficient when coupled with detailed 
information on test site geology. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States demanded the use of a new, intrusive and costly on-site 
measuring technique in which an electric cable is lowered into a parallel hole 
located within 100 feet of the shaft in which the nuclear blast occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Joint U.S.-Soviet experiments were conducted using both methods, and the 
seismic system was found to be at least as accurate as the U.S.-preferred 
technique. But the United States remained adamant, and a compromise was reached 
in which both techniques could be used. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a comprehensive test ban endorse the new protocols as a means of 
moving beyond the old treaties to negotiate further testing limits. One goal is 
a ceiling on the number of tests. Another is to lower the threshold. The hope 
is that new weapon development would become more difficult, if not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
While the most vocal public demands for test bans over the years have come from 
the United States and Western Europe, Soviet citizens under glasnost, 
Gorbachev's policy of openness, are finally catching up and joining with 
testing opponents from the United States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Popular opposition at Semipalatinsk, the test range on Kazakhstan's bleak 
steppes, apparently forced the Kremlin to phase out testing there. Tests would 
only occur in Novaya Zemlya, a remote island near the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer John-Thor Dahlburg in Moscow contributed to this report.

<P>
U.S. and Soviet Nuclear Tests 
</P>
<P>
Key Points of New Testing Protocois 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties, nuclear weapons test and 
non-military explosions are limited to 150 kilotons. 
</P>
<P>
For the time, the United States and Soviet Union will have the right to perform 
on-site monitoring of nuclear tests above 35 kilotons. 
</P>
<P>
Each side also can measure nuclear tests above 50 kilotons by seismic 
instruments or by hydrodynamics.

U.S. ROLLS OUT RESTRAINED RECEPTION;

SCENE: BREEZY WEATHER AND AN UNUSUALLY SUBDUED MOOD GREET GORBACHEV UPON HIS 
ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON.

<P>
An unusually restrained Washington, its residents so ho-hum that a visitor 
could be forgiven for thinking the summit was taking place in Reykjavik, 
Iceland, or Malta or anywhere else, received Mikhail S. Gorbachev on a 
pleasantly cool and breezy late spring afternoon Wednesday for the start of his 
four days of meetings with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred American service personnel and their families, some waving 
small red flags, watched as Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other 
State Department officials welcomed Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, at Andrews 
Air Force Base in the Maryland suburbs of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
After formal statements -- Baker said that "the eyes of the world were upon you 
and President Bush" and Gorbachev wished "peace and well-being to every 
American home" -- Gorbachev suggested to Baker that they move onward. 
</P>
<P>
"Vpered," the Soviet leader said. When the word was translated to Baker as 
"forward," the secretary of state liked it so much that he repeated it in 
Russian, "Vpered." The two men then left the base in a 40-car motorcade to the 
Soviet Embassy on 16th Street in downtown Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The caravan, escorted by police motorcyclists blaring sirens along the way, 
probably gave many Washington motorists their first sure realization that this 
was a historic summit week. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of restraint in Washington could be sensed a few hours before 
Gorbachev arrived. The regular vendors near the White House stacked ample 
supplies of Bart Simpson and Washington Polo Club T-shirts, but none with 
Gorbachev logos or designs. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the scene during Gorbachev's first visit to Washington in 1987, 
photographers did not set up life-size cardboard cutouts of the Soviet leader 
near the White House to entice tourists to be photographed for $5. There was no 
hint of Gorbymania. 
</P>
<P>
A half-continent away, Minnesota officials were so excited about Gorbachev's 
impending visit to Minneapolis on Sunday that they distributed 100 miles of red 
ribbon to 40,000 schoolchildren to decorate the sites that the Soviet leader 
might see during his few hours there. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House had set a different tone for Washington, stressing that the 
meetings would stand more on business than ceremony. The city made no attempt 
to drum up crowds along Gorbachev's route or to decorate the city much beyond 
the traditional trio of Soviet, American and District of Columbia flags on the 
lampposts of some important streets. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, foreign leaders are no novelty in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has just been less impressed with international figures over the 
years," said Dan Rapoport, a Washington book publisher and longtime resident. 
Also, Washingtonians have seen Gorbachev before, at a time, in fact, when he 
struck most of the world as more magical and less vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, though the city seemed restrained, the summit still attracted its quota of 
summit hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
In Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, a Soviet rock band 
named Gaza blared its music while Robert Kunst, executive director of a 
Miami-based organization called Cure AIDS Now, warned journalists: "With the 
wall coming down, the East and West are going to sleep together." 
</P>
<P>
His posters cried out: "With Glasnost and Perestroika and Freedom Comes AIDS. 
Use the Peace Dividend. Cure AIDS Now." 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Klimachkov and Yuri Vostrikov, two Soviet immigrants who described 
themselves as political refugees, sat in a corner of the park and held up 
handwritten signs that claimed they had been continually harassed by the CIA 
and Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating more demonstrations in the days ahead, especially from Baltic 
protesters, National Park Service workers were putting fencing around the grass 
in the park.

<P>
Radical Boris N. Yeltsin called for the resignation of the Soviet government 
Wednesday and warned the Kremlin it would be unable to govern if it blocked 
moves by his powerful Russian Federation to control its own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
At his first news conference since his election Tuesday as president of the 
biggest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, Yeltsin said the federation will 
adopt measures that will make it "independent in everything." 
</P>
<P>
"If the center (Moscow) quarrels with us, whom will it govern?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also condemned Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's plans for 
transformation to a market economy and said he will resist projected price 
rises. 
</P>
<P>
He said previous government programs to reform the economy have failed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once you've failed with a program, a government should resign, and 
then a new government should present a new program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov reported on a plan to create a market economy last week in the Soviet 
Parliament, sparking panic buying and a wave of strike threats. 
</P>
<P>
A central element of the reforms is a big rise in prices in the approach to a 
full market economy. A stage-by-stage threefold increase in the price of bread, 
held artificially low for decades, begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Leonid I. Abalkin said the Soviet 
government will insist on a countrywide referendum in a bid to get popular 
support for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The government will insist on the holding of a referendum, or we will not be 
able to implement reform," Abalkin said in a speech to a conference of Western 
business executives and specialists on trade with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"This government, like any government anywhere, can do nothing without a public 
vote of confidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abalkin's remarks reflected an apparent reversal on the question of a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Abalkin first raised the referendum idea last week, but Ryzhkov appeared to 
back away from it in his speech to Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, landmark bills creating a multi-party system and expanding 
religious freedoms moved forward when both chambers of the Soviet legislature 
gave them preliminary approval. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of political parties have sprung up in the Soviet Union since the 
Communist Party decided in February to end its nearly 70-year monopoly on 
power, but they are still technically illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The new bills would provide a legal basis for the new parties as well as for 
religious organizations, which also do not have legal status.

PANEL OKS RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE SCHOOLS 
</P>

<P>
In the wake of allegations that unscrupulous trade and vocational schools 
continue to bilk disadvantaged and immigrant students out of millions of 
dollars statewide, the Senate Education Committee unanimously approved a bill 
Wednesday that would place new restrictions on the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), would 
strengthen provisions in the law that requires schools to place a substantial 
number of their students in jobs. California already has one of the most 
comprehensive vocational school laws in the nation, and more than a dozen other 
states are considering similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said that trade school fraud has cost taxpayers more 
than $1 billion as students default on their government-guaranteed student 
loans. In California alone, vocational school students have defaulted on about 
$265 million in federal loans, the assemblywoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This looms as a disaster for this country as serious as the S&amp;L (savings 
and loan) crisis," Waters told the committee. "The nation is watching 
California and how it reforms what has become a national scandal." 
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 students enrolled in 2,000 private, for-profit schools across the 
state would be affected by the proposed legislation, which also loosens some 
requirements contained in the current vocational-school reform law that were 
considered a financial burden to law-abiding schools. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office currently is investigating cases of alleged 
fraud involving about one in five of the state's vocational students. 
Typically, the students pay about $5,000 for courses in computer literacy, auto 
repair and other fields but receive little or no instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The law currently allows the state to close a vocational school if fewer than 
60% of the students fail to complete course work. In addition, schools are 
required to place at least 70% of their graduating students, within six months 
of receiving diplomas, in jobs for which they have been trained. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, groups representing the vocational-school industry 
threatened to file suit to block enforcement of the law, which went into effect 
Jan. 1. The groups said the law would drive many schools out of business. 
</P>
<P>
In a concession to the industry, the new bill would exempt many smaller, 
low-cost schools from these requirements, as well as schools in the performing 
and fine arts. Nonprofit religious schools would be exempted. The bill would 
also make enforcement of the law more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill, AB 1401, would strengthen the current law by requiring that 
students be employed in their new jobs for at least 60 days. Now, trade schools 
can meet the employment requirement even if the students are fired after only 
one day of work. 
</P>
<P>
Trade schools would also be required to contribute more to a state-operated 
tuition-recovery fund, designed to provide financial relief to students if 
their schools shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation also prohibits schools from offering jobs to students 
as an inducement to signing a school contract. Many students have been 
recruited to the vocational schools by such promises, only to discover later 
the jobs do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Private Post-Secondary Schools had initially opposed 
the bill, but then agreed to remain "neutral" at Wednesday's committee hearing 
as the result of a last-minute compromise with Waters. 
</P>
<P>
Stan DiOrio, senior assistant to Waters, said the assemblywoman agreed to drop 
a provision of the bill aimed at preventing abuse in the calculation of course 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the trade schools, Waters' office and public-interest law 
firms are likely to continue as the bill goes before the full Senate sometime 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' bill has been endorsed by the attorney general's office, the California 
Student Aid Commission and various public-interest law firms. 
</P>
<P>
But the assemblywoman said she was concerned that industry groups may try to 
block its passage. Although the industry representatives had agreed not to 
oppose the bill in the committee, they declined to sign an agreement that said 
they would not block its passage in the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wilson, a lobbyist for the vocational schools, said he was confident that a 
compromise could be reached.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Insurance commissioner: Whose ads? Democratic candidates Bill Press, 
John Garamendi and Conway Collis. 
</P>
<P>
Press has a new 30-second commercial that attacks two leading opponents, 
Garamendi and Collis, as servants of special interests -- Garamendi of insurers 
and Collis of corporate donors. Garamendi has a 30-second commercial that 
pledges to make every insurance company obey Proposition 103. Collis has a 
30-second commercial that reports he scored highest on a Ralph Nader 
questionnaire of the insurance commissioner candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Press' commercial declares, "As a state legislator, Garamendi took over 
$100,000 from the insurance industry. And now he's been endorsed by the 
insurance industry's lobby. As an elected official, Conway Collis took money 
from corporations and voted them millions in tax breaks. Maybe that's why the 
Democratic Party rejected them and endorsed Bill Press. . . . Bill Press. He's 
on our side." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Garamendi has taken at least $123,000 in his 16 years in the 
Legislature from insurers, a little under $8,000 a year, but he has not taken 
anything from them since announcing for insurance commissioner, and he 
repudiated the endorsement of the legal reform group that Press is referring to 
here. That group, the Assn. for Tort Reform, has been accused of being a front 
for the industry but is not its major lobby. Collis, before 1986, did take 
thousands of dollars in contributions from corporations while occasionally 
voting as a State Board of Equalization member to allow them to pay less taxes 
than the board staff recommended. Since 1986, he says, he has changed his 
policy and will not vote on any matter relating to a party from which he has 
received a contribution. He acknowledges some oversights, but he maintains he 
has "learned" to be a better elected official in recent years. What Press does 
not say in these ads is that, much more than either Garamendi or Collis, he has 
raised money in the insurance commissioner's campaign from one of the major 
special interests in the insurance issue, the trial lawyers. Those 
contributions now amount to at least $273,500. Press does have the official 
endorsement of the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Garamendi's commercial says that "Roxani Gillespie, the Republican 
insurance commissioner, exempted hundreds of companies from Prop. 103's 
requirement to lower insurance rates. We need an insurance commissioner who 
will fight for the people! Democratic Sen. John Garamendi! Sixteen years' 
experience standing up to big corporations." Garamendi then follows the 
announcer and says, "As insurance commissioner, I'll make every insurance 
company obey Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Gillespie indicated last summer she would exempt hundreds of 
companies from Proposition 103 rollbacks, but later reversed herself and left 
the issue open. She has not yet made a single final decision on a rate rollback 
for any company. Garamendi, as a state senator, has earned a reputation for 
standing against many special interests, although he has also voted for many 
bills desired by corporations, as virtually all legislators have. The last 
sentence is a promise Garamendi has made in his campaign. He has repeatedly 
vowed to "clean up the insurance mess," language similar to that used by most 
of the other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Collis' commercial starts with him reiterating that he would be the 
toughest enforcer of Proposition 103, but then an announcer declares: "We 
interrupt this message to bring you a special announcement. Ralph Nader has 
just announced the results of a consumer survey of candidates for insurance 
commissioner. In this survey, Conway Collis scored No. 1." That news is 
repeated four more times in the next few seconds, and Collis appears once more 
in the midst of the repeats saying, "I'll do whatever it takes to make 103 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Collis scored highest, edging candidate Ray Bourhis, in answering a 
Nader questionnaire on policies he would follow as commissioner. But several 
other leading candidates, including Garamendi, Press, Walter Zelman and 
Republican Wes Bannister, refused to answer the questions on grounds that the 
survey was prepared to favor Collis. Nader has stopped short of endorsing 
Collis. As for making Proposition 103 "work," this may be more in the hands of 
the courts than the insurance commissioner.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT SCHOOLS NAME KEELER AS 
SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supt. Douglas Keeler of the Manhattan Beach City School District has been named 
superintendent of the Claremont Unified School District. He expects to begin 
his new $89,500-a-year job by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler, 45, has been superintendent in the Manhattan Beach district, which has 
2,200 students in kindergarten through 8th grade, since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Keeler, who was recruited for the Claremont post, said he is reluctant to leave 
Manhattan Beach because he likes his job and there are still things to 
accomplish in the district, including possible unification with school 
districts in Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, Keeler said the opportunity to head a 6,200-student district, 
including high school grades, is too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dunsmoor, president of the Manhattan Beach school board, said the board 
regrets losing Keeler but understands that the Claremont job "is a marvelous 
opportunity for him."

RESIDENTS DEFEATED IN APPEAL OF AIRPORT NOISE CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: A STATE APPELLATE COURT ALL BUT ENDS A SEVEN-YEAR BATTLE BY BURBANK 
HOMEOWNERS WHEN IT FINDS THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO SUE FOR LOWERED PROPERTY 
VALUES OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A state Court of Appeal ruled in a decision released Wednesday that owners of 
homes near Burbank Airport have no right to sue for emotional distress or 
property damage caused by aircraft noise -- all but ending more than seven 
years of litigation on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel in Los Angeles leaves the 600 
plaintiffs from Burbank, North Hollywood and Sunland only one avenue for their 
case: petitioning the state Supreme Court for a hearing, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
But the plaintiffs' attorney, John J. Schimmenti, estimated the likelihood that 
the state high court would agree to hear the case as "about one out of 100. I 
am not optimistic, although I do plan to petition the court." 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of this ruling is that we have lost everything," said Tom Paterson, 
a North Hollywood homeowner group leader and one of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very strong victory," said Erich Luschei, attorney for the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. "We got all we could have wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs contended that planes using the airport inflict noise on their 
houses, lowering their property values. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that this amounted to "inverse condemnation" -- the practical 
equivalent of a government agency taking away property by condemning it. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the airport convinced a trial judge in 1988 that noise from 
the airport peaked in 1973 and has since been reduced by the introduction of 
quieter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert I. Weil ruled that under state law homeowners could 
not file suit after 1978 -- five years from the point at which the noise 
reached its highest level. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the plaintiffs proved that their property values had suffered as a 
result of the airport noise, the homeowners had forfeited their right to sue by 
not filing within the prescribed time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases were filed in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the delay, Weil ruled, the airport authority acquired a 
"prescriptive avigation easement" -- a permanent right to continue flying over 
the affected properties. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court on Wednesday upheld Weil's ruling that denied property 
damages, and also found for the airport on a lesser issue of emotional damages. 
</P>
<P>
Weil had ruled that the handful of plaintiffs who live close to the airport in 
an area where noise levels exceed state standards could sue for personal 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Schimmenti called it a "minor win for the plaintiffs." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court took that victory away, saying that because the authority had 
acquired an avigation easement, the airport "cannot thereafter be required to 
compensate the plaintiffs for its use of the 
</P>
<P>
easement." 
</P>
<P>
"What they are saying is there is no sense in the authority having an easement 
if they can be penalized for using the easement," Luschei said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the lawsuits were filed in 1983, five years after the authority bought 
the airport from Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the case, plaintiffs had hoped that the five-year time limit would 
start with the 1978 sale. 
</P>
<P>
But Weil also ruled -- and the plaintiffs did not appeal the point -- that with 
the purchase of the airport the authority had acquired all the easements 
belonging to Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
Airport spokesman Victor J. Gill said Wednesday that although the authority at 
one time worried that pending litigation would raise the cost of money it must 
borrow to build a new terminal, that proved not to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sold bonds on several occasions while these cases were pending," he 
said, "and investors haven't seemed unduly worried." 
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, we welcome the lifting of the cloud of litigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmenti, who took the case on contingency, with plaintiffs paying no fees, 
declined to say Wednesday how much the case had cost him. 
</P>
<P>
Paterson said the appeal court decision probably would persuade noise 
protesters that they "have to look places other than the courts for relief." 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking now maybe we have to get our congressional delegation to impose 
some kind of growth limit on the airport."

WEB OF SHADY 'GREENWAYS' ENVISIONED IN RAIL CORRIDORS; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLANDS: THE RTD DIRECTOR HAS SUGGESTED LANES FOR BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS 
AS A MEANS OF CONNECTING COMMUNITIES AND BRINGING 'THE COUNTRY BACK TO LOS 
ANGELES.' 
</P>

<P>
A group of community leaders presented a plan Wednesday to transform a dusty 
15-mile stretch of Southern Pacific railroad track in the San Fernando Valley 
into a swath of tree-lined trails for bicyclists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The group envisions a shady strip connecting North Hollywood with Warner Center 
as the first section of what they hope will be a web of many "greenways" built 
along old Southern Pacific right of ways around Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to bring the country back to Los Angeles," said Nikolas 
Patsaouras, director of the Southern California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles greenways are the brainchild of Patsaouras, his solution to the 
dearth of parkland in a county where land is scarce and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be creative, innovative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, a number of cities -- such as Boston and Washington -- have 
developed greenways, many of which snake along former railroad rights of way. 
In addition to recreational uses, greenways can aid wildlife migration and 
encourage use of people-powered alternatives to automobile traffic. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and City Councilman Marvin Braude, who helped 
develop bike trails in Santa Monica, supported the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Valley greenway follows the route of the proposed Metro Rail 
extension that will run between North Hollywood and Warner Center. The Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission is negotiating to buy the rights of 
way on old Southern Pacific lines around the county. Neil Peterson, the 
commission's executive director, said the commission would like to see the land 
developed as greenways. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said the Valley greenway would be the first of many such grassy 
sarteries around the county. Other proposed greenways would connect Los Angeles 
with Santa Monica, South Gate with Anaheim and Highland Park with Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Snyder, a transportation planner and expert on bikeways, said the proposed 
Valley greenway could be used by bicycle commuters to alleviate traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"The route would directly serve several important destinations, including 
Warner Center, the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, Birmingham High School, as 
well as several other smaller schools and parks," he said. "It could be used as 
a commuter route, and would likely be popular as a recreational route." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who heard the proposal liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"We support very actively what you're trying to do here," Don Schultz, 
president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., told Patsaouras. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras estimated that the greenway would cost about $1.5 million and would 
be funded in large part by money from Proposition 70, which was passed in 1988 
and made about $120 million available to cities for open-space projects such as 
greenways. 
</P>
<P>
Communities along the route would be primarily responsible for developing 
individual sections of the greenway. On Tuesday, Antonovich proposed an 
Adopt-A-Tree program that would encourage residents to defray the cost of 
landscaping by paying for a tree along the route.

OFFICER SAYS 'CHEERS' STAR ADMITTED DISCARDING COCAINE

A Los Angeles police officer testified Wednesday that "Cheers" star Kelsey 
Grammer confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine in his patrol car after 
the actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That cocaine was in my pocket. I felt stupid. I should have just told you I 
had it," Officer Michael Akana quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better 
than that. I would like to apologize to you," Grammer allegedly added. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubbly beard, Grammer -- who plays 
the pompous psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the popular television program -- 
appeared cheerful as he entered Van Nuys Municipal Court for the brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer is serving a 30-day sentence for a probation violation stemming from an 
unrelated drunk driving conviction. Jail officials said that due to jail 
overcrowding, Grammer will be released Saturday after serving only 10 days of 
the sentence.

Akana was the sole witness at the preliminary hearing on the cocaine possession 
charge stemming from Grammer's April 14, 1988, arrest in North Hollywood after 
a routine traffic stop. Judge Aviva K. Bobb said the evidence was sufficient to 
hold Grammer for trial and scheduled a Van Nuys Superior Court arraignment for 
June 13. 
</P>
<P>
Akana testified that he stopped Grammer's red sports car because it had expired 
license plates. Grammer's eyes at the time were bloodshot and he appeared pale, 
flushed and fatigued and smelled of alcohol, Akana said. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and driving without a 
license and taken by patrol car to the North Hollywood police station for a 
breath test. Because the blood-alcohol measuring machine was broken, Grammer 
was taken to the Van Nuys police station, where the one-quarter gram packet of 
cocaine was found in the police car, Akana said. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer's blood-alcohol content was measured at 0.03% -- well below the legal 
standard for driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, Robert L. Diamond, Grammer's attorney, said his client was 
wearing a borrowed jacket on the night of his arrest and that the cocaine did 
not belong to him.

DESPITE DEADLOCK OVER FIGURES, SANTA CLARITA DEVELOPMENT WON'T DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations between a developer and the Santa Clarita City Council over the 
controversial Santa Catarina condominium project have stalemated, but neither 
side is willing to say the project is dead just yet. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development has become the most hotly debated and contentious 
issue in the young city's history. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has dominated the City Council's political agenda for weeks and has 
been the topic of marathon public hearings. The issue has even attracted the 
attention of the state attorney general's office, which on May 21 criticized 
the adequacy of the project's environmental impact report and called for the 
report to be redone. 
</P>
<P>
The state would have to go to court, however, to compel the city to order a new 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council discussed the project briefly Tuesday night, saying the city 
is standing by its latest demands to G.H. Palmer Associates, the project's 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gilbert M. Archuletta, a Palmer Associates attorney, said the next 
move is up to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This is cat and mouse," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said of the give-and-take over the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer Associates originally proposed building 1,452 condominiums on 135 acres 
in Canyon Country, north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. 
</P>
<P>
In return for city approval of the project, the company also pledged to build 
$55 million worth of badly needed roads that city engineers say are beyond the 
city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents denounced the proposal, saying the city was selling out to the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
They also charged that the project would clog streets with traffic and ruin the 
character of the surrounding neighborhood, which is dominated by single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the city and Palmer Associates, in an attempt to appease 
critics, drafted seven alternative plans, ranging from 385 houses to 1,292 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
On May 4 the City Council rejected the seven plans and drafted its own, which 
would have allowed construction of up to 800 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the company and the city quickly bogged down, with 
developer Dan Palmer saying the council's plan was not financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George Caravalho, recognizing the deadlock, ordered city staff to 
halt all work on the project last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not making any progress that I could see," Caravalho told the council 
Tuesday night. "At this point I don't see any viable proposal on the table." 
</P>
<P>
Archuletta said the company made a counteroffer of 1,000 units for the Santa 
Catarina site. 
</P>
<P>
But Darcy said the counteroffer just rehashes elements of the alternative plans 
the council already rejected. "That offer is not acceptable to the council," 
Darcy said. "It wasn't acceptable then and it's not acceptable now."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phillip Frederick Johnson, former principal of Walter Reed Junior High School 
in North Hollywood, where he founded the school's program for gifted students, 
has died in Woodland Hills. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was a teacher, registrar and vice principal during his 28 years with 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. He retired in 1974 after 12 years as 
principal at Walter Reed where he started the individualized honors program for 
gifted students in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
He served as president of the San Fernando Valley Coordinating Councils Area 
Assn., president of the North Hollywood Rotary Club in 1969 and as a member of 
the North Hollywood YMCA Board. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Nov. 1, 1909, in Des Moines, Iowa. In World War II, he was in the 
infantry, becoming a lieutenant colonel. He served 28 years in the Army 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, June Johnson of Woodland Hills; sons, Phillip 
Johnson Jr. of Portland, Ore., and William Michael Johnson of Watsonville, 
Calif.; daughter, JoAnne Johnson Sweeney of Portland; daughter-in-law, 
Elizabeth Johnson of Portland, Ore.; brother, Richard Morrow Johnson of Los 
Angeles; and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson died Monday of a ruptured aorta, his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be at 10 a.m. Saturday at St. Mel's Catholic Church in 
Woodland Hills, where Johnson sang in the choir. In lieu of flowers, donations 
can be sent to the North Hollywood Charity Foundation in care of Quisenberry 
Insurance Co., 4342 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, 91602. J.T. Oswald

I read with some interest your article captioned "Asian-American Seeks Apology 
for Remark," which appeared May 16. While I was not present at the Optimist 
meeting where this incident occurred, as a local businessman intimately 
familiar with some of the participants, I feel that some objective comment is 
in order. 
</P>
<P>
Recent incidents with Al Campanis of the Los Angeles Dodgers and popular TV 
personalities show that every aspect of our society is supercharged with the 
notion that there should not be racism anywhere. Nothing could be more true. I 
certainly do not condone racial slurs, and knowing Albert (Bud) Marley as I do, 
do not feel this was intended. As the immediate past president of the Calabasas 
Chamber of Commerce, I took it upon myself to meet with, and on many occasions 
work with, Marley. He is not only a superlative administrator but is a 
dedicated representative of what local residents view to be the best school 
district in the state, and he has frequently shown his excellence as both an 
administrator and an educator. I can say without any hesitation that Marley 
could not and does not have a bigoted or prejudiced bone in his body. This is 
not to say that he may not have misspoken or perhaps used improper phraseology 
to express a point. 
</P>
<P>
The point of all this, however, is to let us not so immerse ourselves in the 
rallying cries of today as to lose sight of what is really important and to 
recognize excellence when it is among us. Had we more educators and people in 
government who approached the excellence of Bud Marley, this would be a better 
world.

This letter is in response to your news story about the comment made by the 
superintendent of the Las Virgenes School District during the meeting of the 
Optimist Club of Calabasas. The superintendent, Albert Marley, described Asians 
as "slant-eyed." 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese-American attorney, Lyn K. Phillips, was present, and she sent a 
letter of protest to Marley. Marley accepted her criticism and her counsel but 
did not apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Marley should have apologized even if he meant to insult no one, simply because 
the remark did insult someone. What is more disturbing is the Optimist Club's 
washing its hands of the sentiments of Phillips' letter of protest. But the 
worst by far is the comment by Laura Marcinik, who justified Marley's choice of 
words by saying, "It was not meant as a racial slur. He was just trying to 
describe the situation." 
</P>
<P>
I suppose after this it will be all right to describe an integrated scene as a 
bunch of white people mingling with a bunch of coloreds. It might be argued 
that these two descriptions are too different to compare. But the point is, if 
we are not sensitive about describing or referring to people with respect, we 
are taking giant steps backwards to quickly erase the progress we have made in 
this country since the days of the civil rights movement.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRESTED OVER HARASSING NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old Montrose man was arrested on suspicion of making numerous 
annoying phone calls to members of a La Canada Flintridge family and painting 
swastikas on their garage and automobile, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Randy John Emerson, a former neighbor of the victims, was arrested Tuesday 
evening on suspicion of vandalism and of making more than 20 telephone calls to 
the residence of David Baisley, 53, since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Baisley reported the calls to deputies after he received four in one hour May 
23. According to deputies, Baisley said the calls had "neo-Nazi overtones." 
Baisley told authorities Monday morning that he had found swastikas painted on 
his garage door and car hood. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Gabe Ramirez said call-tracing equipment was placed on phones in the 
house in the 200 block of Baptiste Way, and a call was traced Tuesday to the 
home of Emerson's parents, who are neighbors of the Baisleys. 
</P>
<P>
Further investigation determined that Emerson made the calls while at his 
parents' house and he was arrested, Ramirez said. The motivation was unknown, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.

BERRY PUZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found your article "Strawberry Fields Not Forever" (May 18) very 
enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
I came up with some interesting conclusions of my own from the graphs in the 
article by comparing the bumper strawberry crop of 1986 with the poor 
strawberry crop of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The farmer, for his efforts, earned an average of $705.25 per acre for his 1986 
bumper crop. But he was only able to earn an average of $650.56 per acre for 
his poorer crop in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
So, the farmer surprisingly had an 8% decline in earnings per acre, instead of 
a comparable increase in earnings established by supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
One has to conclude that the exceptionally high retail prices of strawberries 
in 1988 were being artificially kept high by the service side of the food 
industry. One has to ask, "Are the food prices established by the free market 
system? Or are they established by taking advantage of the farmer and by 
whatever the market will bear?"

SPEAKING OF SEX;

<P>
NURSE FINDS LOYAL AUDIENCE FOR TALK SHOW ON TINY RADIO STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From tiny KFOX-FM in Redondo Beach, JoAnn Woodward -- no relation to Paul 
Newman -- tells Los Angeles whatever it wants to know about sex every Wednesday 
morning on "South Bay Sex." 
</P>
<P>
Although other programs feature doctors or psychologists who dispense advice 
about sex and other topics, hers is the only radio talk show in the Los Angeles 
Basin devoted exclusively to sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward, a certified nurse practitioner, said she began the show, which is 
oriented toward women, three years ago because she believed "women have a lot 
of questions that they need answered." Since then, she has attracted a small 
but devoted audience that includes counselors who advise their clients to tune 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aired from 8:30 until 9 a.m. on KFOX (93.5 FM), a station that 
sells time to people who want to produce their own broadcasts. The eclectic mix 
on KFOX has included a feminist businesswoman's program, fundamentalist 
religion and a dating service. 
</P>
<P>
The station, with offices just off the Redondo Beach Pier, reaches an area 
stretching from Malibu to Laguna Beach and inland as far as downtown Los 
Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Although Woodward's breezy presentation, intermixed with advertisements for her 
nursing practice, is not the polished professional format found on larger 
stations, she has dealt with topics many others would not touch. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent programs have been devoted to masturbation, the role of the 
clitoris in society, sexually transmitted diseases (with graphic descriptions 
of symptoms), and the latest in condoms, a model designed for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear I'm not making it up," she said of the last topic. "They call me the 
Dr. Ruth of the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
Although she speaks frankly on the air, Woodward said she has not been a target 
of obscene or abusive phone calls, even after a program devoted to the subject 
of abortion. "I have never gotten calls from fundamentalists," said Woodward, 
who described her program as a "pro-choice show." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Woodward's guest was Shelley Lessin Stockwell, a former airline 
flight attendant and author of a forthcoming book, "Sex and Other Touchy 
Subjects." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep all the flight attendant jokes out of this," Woodward told 
Stockwell in opening the program. "What got you interested in the field of 
sexuality?" 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised in the school of the double standard," Stockwell said. "It was 
very clearly brought home that my job in life was to remain a virgin, go to 
college, snag myself a nice, professional man using my sexuality as the bait 
and have lots of children and live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell said that plan was derailed in the 1970s "when people were going hog 
crazy wild." She recalled once going with her gynecologist to "some people's 
house, and they were having an orgy. I was horrified. It was so opposite to the 
way I have been raised. That was my first sexual eye-opener to how people were 
behaving in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
Some time later, she said, she made love to her boyfriend "in a very loving 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, she said, "all I could think of is, 'They lied to me.' They told me 
-- they meaning society, my parents -- that if you made love before you got 
married, that a man would use you, he wouldn't respect you and the relationship 
would end, basically, because you had to be a virgin. 
</P>
<P>
"And what I found was that we were closer and more bonded and more intimate, 
and I felt so cheated that I had wasted all that time when I could have been 
intimate because of that obscure rule that didn't make any sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
At this, Woodward interjected, "However, we don't recommend that you have 
sexual activity until you are ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Stockwell took a call from a woman identifying herself as 
Camille. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in a monogamous relationship for years, for well before 
AIDS became a household word," Camille began. 
</P>
<P>
"And recently that relationship ended and I started to date again. I would like 
your perspective on how to approach the subject of AIDS with a prospective 
lover . . . how soon in a relationship it should be approached, and in a way 
that it is not calculating." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell responded: "Well, I don't think at hors d'oeuvres at your first 
dinner date would be appropriate. 'Gee, it's so nice to meet you. What a lovely 
suit, and by the way, do you have AIDS?' 
</P>
<P>
"But somewhere early on, maybe after the first smooch or something. I don't 
know. What do you think, JoAnn? You're an expert on this." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward advised posing the question early in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never too soon to approach it," she said. "It's important for you to talk 
about it because it's on everybody's mind. I think that a person who hears you 
talk about it will have a lot of respect for your self-esteem and how highly 
you value your health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
Camille seemed a bit dubious about this. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll give it a wing," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell took one more call, from a woman who wanted to know how to put aside 
workday worries when she gets home from the office. 
</P>
<P>
The answer: Visualize a shelf attached to the outside of your house and imagine 
yourself making a tidy package of "work." Place the package on the shelf and 
ignore it until it's time to leave for work the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the program, Woodward confided in an interview, she asked 
friends to call in questions, but she said that is no longer necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first did this show three years ago, I had 'prepped' callers, but my 
friends have long since stopped calling. You can't ask someone every Wednesday 
morning, 'Do me a favor. . . .' It ended a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Although KFOX does not subscribe to the Arbitron radio audience rating service, 
Woodward and others say that "South Bay Sex" has a devoted audience. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke McIntyre, South Bay Free Clinic's services director, said Woodward is 
serving a useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people are coming in for checkups as a result of her show," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "People I know as friends comment about her show and how informative 
it was and how wonderful it was for them." 
</P>
<P>
Cam McCarthy, a licensed marriage, family and child counselor in Manhattan 
Beach, advises her clients to tune in to Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
"She will answer things over the air that everyone wanted to know but never had 
the guts to ask. You can listen to it while you are washing the dishes or 
driving a car or whatever. . . . It reaches people who aren't going to be 
reached in other ways."

BEST BETS: ART IN THE PARK

Are you feeling cultural, but don't want to browse through a stuffy museum when 
the June sun shines above? Then head to the green lawns of the Exxon Co. in 
Thousand Oaks Saturday and Sunday for Artwalk '90.

The third annual juried fine arts festival will feature the works of about 135 
artists and crafts people, plus plenty of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>

BUILDING TENTATIVELY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission has tentatively approved construction of a two-story, 
8,000-square-foot financial office building at Huntington Drive and Granada 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
It postponed a final decision on the building's design pending a review by the 
city's Design Review Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has placed restrictions on new or expanding stock brokerage 
and real estate firms. But a spokesman for Trusty Associates, an Alhambra-based 
financial services firm that will occupy the building, said the company will 
not function as a brokerage house. Trusty spokesman Anthony Chang said most of 
the 25 employees will be brokers acting as financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"This site will be used primarily for research purposes," added Philip Yao, 
spokesman for M. C. Y. Development Co., which owns the property.

BEST BETS: HIPSTER DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dinosaurs may no longer grace the earth, but don't tell that to Stella 
Stegosaurus and Dinah Diplodocus. 
</P>
<P>
They and a host of other prehistoric creatures are part of an acclaimed musical 
adventure titled "Dinosaur Rock." 
</P>
<P>
The children's quasi-rock opera will be performed at 7 p.m. today in the 
Ventura High School Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
An award-winning children's album in 1984, "Dinosaur Rock" was adapted for the 
stage, its original songs performed by a septet of walking, talking and dancing 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's education through entertainment," said Brian Bemel, director of the 
Ventura Children's Festival. "The kids have a high interest in dinosaurs," he 
said. "Through the play and song, they are introduced to the different types, 
as well as such things as the theory of evolution." 
</P>
<P>
A yodeling paleontologist has the magical power to give life to a museum 
collection of dinosaurs. In a mixture of musical styles, from rock and swing to 
bluegrass and polka, seven reptiles portray their extinction and more. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura High School Auditorium, is located at 2155 E. Main St., Ventura. 
Tickets are $6.50, $4.50 for children. Call 648-5251 or 650-9688.

Pam Gonzalez and 19 other women have been preparing an enormous number of 
pastries for the 8,000 attendees expected at this year's Greek Festival '90 in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by the St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church, Friday through Sunday, the 
festival is a time for feasting and fun. Continuous music, folk dance 
exhibitions and lessons will be featured, as well as Greek food. And a trip for 
two to Greece will be given away as a prize. 
</P>
<P>
The Hellenic Sounds of Los Angeles and accordionist Polka Bill will provide the 
music. Food booths will offer ethnic delicacies. The pastries -- 30,000 of them 
-- were prepared ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something you throw together the week before," said Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Baklava is a favorite. But the most popular is galataboureko, a custard-filled 
caloric wonder, bathed in a lemony syrup. 
</P>
<P>
"We increased production by 400% over last year to meet the demand." 
</P>
<P>
St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church is at 400 Skyway Drive, Camarillo. Festival 
hours: 5 to 10 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, and noon to 7 p.m. 
Sunday. Admission is free. For information, call 482-1273.

POMONA VOTERS WILL DECIDE ON MAJOR CHANGES TO COUNCIL 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters will decide Tuesday whether to expand the City Council and change the 
method of electing its members. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition M asks whether council members should be elected by district 
instead of citywide, the current practice. Two other measures, Propositions N 
and O, give voters alternatives if Proposition M passes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition N would create seven council districts, and council members would 
choose a mayor from among themselves. Proposition O would create six council 
districts and provide for the mayor, as the board's seventh member, to be 
elected in a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The city is divided into four council districts. Council members must live in 
their districts, but are elected at large. The mayor, who acts as a member of 
the council and presides at its meetings, also is elected by the entire city. 
Council members Nell Soto, C. L. (Clay) Bryant and Tomas Ursua have pushed for 
district elections. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said a district system would produce more community participation. She 
said candidates would find it cheaper and easier to run in a district than to 
campaign for votes throughout the city. In addition, she said, enlarging the 
council would give each member a smaller area of the city to serve, making it 
easier to meet the needs of constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said she also favors Proposition N, allowing seven council members to 
appoint a mayor from among themselves. That sort of system works well in 
Pasadena and other cities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryant, who is fighting to retain his seat in a recall election June 5, 
favors an elected mayor. His campaign committee is posting signs in the city 
urging a "yes" vote on Propositions M and O. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua, who has urged district elections as a means of increasing minority 
representation, was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against the city 
in 1985 by the Southwest Voter Rights Education Project. The suit noted that 
Pomona has never had a black council member although the 1980 census said 19% 
of the population was black. 
</P>
<P>
The courts upheld the city's at-large election system, but the council decided 
to submit the issue to voters anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no organized campaign to retain the current system, 
Mayor Donna Smith said she prefers it. Smith said she would rather vote on all 
council members than elect a single council member from her own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the district system would take effect with the next 
council elections in March, 1991.

<P>
You would never describe Avanti as rustic. Outside it's lit in glowing bands of 
neon; inside it smacks of glossy good taste, Italian style. 
</P>
<P>
It is filled to the brim with trendy food decor -- shelves of imported olive 
oil, trays of fresh pasta, garlic braids and dried pepper clusters. 
</P>
<P>
The drive there is pleasantly rural -- it's on the road between Ventura and 
Ojai. The odd-shaped building has been squeezed onto a tiny lot between two 
roads, and the inside of the restaurant seems squeezed as well. The tables are 
so closely spaced that diners look like guests at a big Italian family party, 
seated together at long tables. The owners, who circulate the room like perfect 
hosts, refilling glasses and making sure that everybody's happy, give the place 
a festive, light-hearted atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The food is also part of the charm. Wood-fired pizza and fresh pasta are the 
main draw. The first thing that was put on the table was a basket of hot, fresh 
focaccia, drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled with rosemary and set under the 
broiler to toast the herb. 
</P>
<P>
Right away, I knew the pizza would be good. The kids were relieved to find that 
among trendy offerings, like basil and mozzarella or smoked salmon and cream 
cheese pizza, they were able to find plain pepperoni. The barbecued chicken 
pizza had a good crust, thick, chewy cheese and crisp red onions. The heavy 
smoked flavor of the chicken paired nicely with the kick of fresh cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
The minestrone was full of the flavors of fresh herbs and contained big slices 
of vegetables, including whole spinach leaves. Steamed New Zealand mussels came 
with a soupy black bean sauce containing peppers and tiny beans. It made a 
great dipping sauce for the focaccia. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll love it, Mom," my son informed me, tasting the scampi. "Fish is never 
this good." The four fat shrimp curled up in a garlic lemon wine sauce were 
great. 
</P>
<P>
Broiled lamb loin came sliced and cooked just the way I had ordered it. The 
sauce had hints of garlic and sherry, and the meat was delicious. The 
vegetables were perfectly plain. Fettuccine with marinara sauce was basically 
fine, but couldn't compare to some of the pasta entrees. I especially liked the 
fresh tomato and basil sauce, and angel-hair pasta served with shrimp and 
melted chunks of mozzarella in a fine pesto sauce. Another good pasta came with 
a cream sauce containing bay scallops, oyster mushrooms, bits of fresh tomato 
and oregano. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts at Avanti are as good as the rest of the food. The fruit tart had four 
kinds of sweet, perfect fruit on a bed of soft, almost tart cream and a crisp, 
flaky crust. The tirami su was one of the best I've tried. 
</P>
<P>
I wish we lived on the road to Avanti. I'd be tempted to stop by for takeout 
every night of the week. 
</P>

HILL GIVES BACKING TO HORCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who said last week that he would not 
endorse anyone as his successor in the 52nd Assembly District, changed his mind 
this week and endorsed Diamond Bar Councilman Paul Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he endorsed Horcher because of Horcher's support during his campaign 
for the state Senate earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher was so critical of former Diamond Bar Councilman Gary Miller, who was 
running against Hill, that Horcher was removed by his council colleagues as 
mayor pro tem, next in line to become mayor. "I had a tough time saying no to 
Paul," Hill said. "He stuck his neck out for me. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher's opponents quickly downplayed the endorsement's significance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to be a big deal in this campaign," said Kenneth 
Manning, a Hacienda La Puente school board member who is one of eight 
Republicans in the primary. Wil Baca, a Hacienda Heights businessman and 
engineer, noted that Hill only last week had said he would not make an 
endorsement because there was no front-runner. Nothing has happened in the 
campaign to change that, Baca said, adding that the race is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans in the race are Hacienda Heights Improvement Assn. board 
member Jim Baker, West Covina construction foreman Jack Dortignac, former Rep. 
Wayne Grisham of La Mirada, La Habra Heights attorney Paul Mautino and Hacienda 
Heights political aide Tony Russo. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Neely, a Diamond Bar marketing consultant, is the only Democrat in the 
race.

MUIR GOES FOR STATE TRACK TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Muir High will be among the favorites in both the boys' and girls' divisions 
when it competes in the 71st CIF State Track and Field Championships Friday and 
Saturday in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are defending champions in the girls' division but might have 
their best opportunity for a title in the boys' division. 
</P>
<P>
The Muir girls have seven qualifiers competing, including two relay teams, but 
Coach Jim Brownfield said his squad will have difficulty outscoring Bakersfield 
for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Muir could also be hindered by a recurring ankle injury to standout sprinter 
Inger Miller, which surfaced again at the Southern Section Masters Meet last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult road for us at best," Brownfield said. "Even if we were 
healthy it would have been tough for us." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a senior, finished second to freshman Marion Jones of Rio Mesa in both 
the 100- and 200-meter runs at the Masters Meet. Miller had qualifying times of 
11.65 seconds in the 100 and 24.27 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
She is also a member of the 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams. The Mustangs 
produced qualifying marks of 46.23 seconds in the 400 and 3:53.65 in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
The girls also qualified Taminika Terry in the 100 and 200 meters and Akua 
Sutherland in the triple jump. Sutherland finished third with a jump of 38 
feet, 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The Muir boys have four qualifiers. The Mustangs had the fastest qualifying 
times in three events. Senior Andre Devezin won the 110-meter high hurdles in 
14.47 seconds and the 400 and 1,600 relay teams won in times of 41.46 and 
3:15.52. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs also have a strong scoring threat with Mike Sulcer in the 
400-meter run, where he turned in a fast qualifying time of 48.21 seconds. 
Among Muir's top challengers for the title could be Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Julianna Yendork of Walnut, defending champion in both the long and triple 
jumps, turned in top qualifying marks of 19-4 in the long jump and 41-1 1/4 in 
the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Hecox of South Hills, who was the top qualifier in the 3,200-meter run 
with a time of 10:41.99, also qualified in the 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Seven high schools from the San Gabriel Valley have been listed among the 
winners of the eighth annual CIF-Southern Section Shake for Sportsmanship 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
The schools are San Gabriel, Mountain View, Sierra Vista, Webb, Temple City, 
West Covina and South Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Schools were selected for having distinguished themselves in sportsmanship 
during the 1989-90 athletic year. There were 60 winners from the Southern 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
A representative from each school will be honored prior to the Dodgers-Atlanta 
Braves game Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at Dodger Stadium.

Jerry Shore and Leslie Steinmetz, a retired unmarried couple, have made their 
Santa Barbara home into a Skinner Box or "self-contained environment of 
positive reinforcements." 
</P>
<P>
Before they ever read B.F. Skinner's book "Enjoy Old Age," which applies 
behavioral psychology techniques in the pursuit of aging gracefully, Shore and 
Steinmetz started putting his theories into practice.

When they bought their retirement house, they surrounded it with the garden 
Steinmetz had always dreamed of, with blooms at every window. They converted 
the garage into an artist's studio, his dream, and covered the house's walls 
with his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do believe Skinner -- that punishments and rewards determine human 
behavior," says Steinmetz, a former schoolteacher. "That's why we made an 
enormous effort to make an environment that's attractive and welcoming for 
ourselves and also to keep it comfortable and free of annoyances. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened the kitchen out into the living and dining areas because Jerry likes 
to cook but doesn't like to be isolated. And throughout the house we've put 
things in easy reach. There's nothing that keeps you from activity as much as 
remembering you got cut or burned last time. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is their environment in keeping with Skinner's theories, but the 
couple have fashioned a schedule for themselves that the behaviorist would 
approve. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is very structured around here," Steinmetz says. "Mornings, Jerry paints. 
I garden. We love every minute of it. We give our afternoons over to things we 
believe in. Sometimes it's worked, sometimes it hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Shore, who worked in health care, said he was thrilled to be called in as a 
consultant to help plan a nonprofit medical center. But soon after starting, he 
became frustrated because his associates found his ideas old-fashioned. 
Steinmetz had a similar experience at a school. 
</P>
<P>
"Skinner's advice," says Shore, "is to try to avoid doing things as you learned 
to do them. Old people are more likely to tackle a problem in old ways because 
they've been practicing the old ways longer." 
</P>
<P>
Yet no matter how they tried, they had trouble accepting new ideas. Finally, 
they seized upon another bit of Skinner wisdom: "What you feel depends largely 
on what you do. And what you do is the thing to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
Shore began working with a political organization, where he edits their 
newsletter. He also serves on the County Grand Jury, heading one of its 
committees. Now he describes his work as "time-consuming but a very interesting 
experience." Steinmetz joined the Peace Resource Center in Santa Barbara, which 
she now heads. 
</P>
<P>
"We found we have much more fun exercising our civic responsibility," she says, 
laughing. "And when we get tired of that, we'll play a little. We're planning 
to go to the Edinburgh Music Festival in July." 
</P>
<P>
And, says Shore, the excitement and "positive reinforcements are not just in 
the house. We make a real effort to have friends, especially young ones. Leslie 
took a class in horticulture at the university and made friends with a young 
woman who's a professional gardener. They do a lot of things together. I found 
two neighbors, men who, like me, enjoy doing the shopping and cooking. We go on 
expeditions together to get fresh fish -- or buy our fruit and vegetables 
direct from the farmer." 
</P>
<P>
He says that Skinner suggests people plan so the imperfections of old age don't 
prevent them from enjoying life. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," Shore pulls out a small piece of paper from his pocket, 
"memoranda instead of memory. You see," he goes on. "Now we're really doing 
what Skinner advises in the book. We attack old age as a problem to be solved. 
Then we enjoy solving it. When we just can't," he says, "we resort to humor."

THE SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE IN OJAI OFFERS SECLUSION, A BEAUTIFUL VIEW AND, OF

<P>
There is a place in Ojai that is so still and private that Hollywood types slip 
in frequently for weekend getaways. In fact, two Canadian psychologists once 
holed up here for weeks to write a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
So if you suffer from ho-hum breakfast, whiny kids, noise overload or a simple 
case of the blahs, you may find the relief you need at Casa de La Luna, a 
one-of-a-kind bed-and-breakfast hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient oak trees envelop the long driveway leading to the 5,000-square-foot 
Spanish-style home Bud and Doris Scott built themselves in 1968. It's part of a 
seven-acre estate they call the Gardens of Perpetual Spring, named for the 
2,000 flowers, shrubs and trees they've planted. 
</P>
<P>
The Scotts' talent and resourcefulness are apparent all over the house and 
grounds of Casa de La Luna, yet the couple have a casual, warm and folksy 
manner. On a recent morning, Doris Scott was pushing a broom on the walkways. 
Her husband, in jeans and an undershirt, was working on a temperamental toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Scott, a 70-year-old retired dentist, loves to talk about his cattle 
ranching family, which settled in Ventura in 1869. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather was known as the cussingest man on the plains," he said. Bud 
was a rancher himself in the San Joaquin Valley until he decided to study 
dentistry at the age of 36. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to practice dentistry in Mexico," he said. "I settled for building 
Mexico here," he said, gesturing around the vast home. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to build an authentic colonial hacienda," he said. "So we started 
exploring Mexico to find out what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
They found it in a little village in northern Mexico. It was the jail -- housed 
in an old hacienda. 
</P>
<P>
They drew the plans for the house, and pretty much built it themselves, with 
the help of their daughter, Carol Barr, the oldest of their three grown 
children. The huge wooden front doors open to a spacious entryway with a high, 
beamed ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the 1984 Olympics, they never would have gotten into the 
bed-and-breakfast business. When the call went out for Ojai Valley residents to 
open their homes to athletes, the Scotts did just that. 
</P>
<P>
Casa de La Luna has been open ever since. It's one of only four home-style 
bed-and-breakfast spots in the county. (Santa Barbara has at least 15.) 
</P>
<P>
Barr, a nurse and the mother of two children, is now back home with her family 
to help her parents run the place. Both mother and daughter are artists and the 
house is filled with their work. Barr's specialty is porcelain painting. Her 
delicate roses are seen on the tile and sinks in the guest bathrooms and on the 
many oil lamps and vases. 
</P>
<P>
Together, mother and daughter painted an exquisite Florentine rose ceiling in 
the dining room. Below it is a long table, carved by Bud Scott. His wife 
hand-finished, stained and upholstered 14 chairs for the table. He cut ornate 
windows in the room and fitted them with stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings hang everywhere, some by Doris and Carol. Others are collectors 
items. They sell limited-edition prints, and often display works from 
collections on loan. 
</P>
<P>
There are six rooms available to guests, ranging from $65 to $95 a night. Three 
are in the main house, two in a converted caretaker's home, and one is a 
separate cottage. All have baths, two have fireplaces, and one is quite roomy, 
1,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
They all have little personal touches. The curtains and decorative pillows are 
handmade. 
</P>
<P>
"I found these wonderful marbles at a Ben Franklin store," said Barr, pointing 
to a tall glass of glistening marbles on a dresser in one of the rooms. Years 
ago, her grandmother had a similar goblet on her dresser. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast at Casa de La Luna is a treat. Macadamia nuts, gathered from the 
trees on the estate, go into the waffles. And, oranges, peaches, tangerines, 
apples, plums, cherries, apricots, lemons and limes -- all grown there -- go 
into the fruit salad. They also serve eggs, potatoes, and French toast. 
</P>
<P>
But the best part of all is the view from the dining room table. It faces an 
aviary where two dozen or so canaries and other birds flutter about. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to sit on the window side of the table," said Doris Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other home-style bed-and-breakfast spots in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
* La Mer, 411 Poli St., Ventura: This 1890 Cape Cod-style house has a view of 
the ocean. The five rooms are decorated in a European motif. A breakfast buffet 
includes fruits, homemade cereal, cheeses, European breads, ham, croissants, 
apple strudel and homemade cakes served in a Bavarian-style dining room. 
Complementary wine comes with each room. Mid-week specials include excursions 
to a local dude ranch, Wheeler Hot Springs and carriage rides in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
* Theodore Woolsey House, 1484 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai: This oak-shaded house, built 
in 1887, is a historic landmark. The seven rooms are decorated with antiques. 
Breakfast, served buffet style, includes pastries, breads, muffins and cereal 
-- oatmeal in winter. 
</P>
<P>
* Ojai Manor Hotel, 210 E. Matilija St., Ojai: This former school, built in 
1874, is the oldest building in Ojai. Located downtown, the two-story building 
with six guest rooms features contemporary art, antiques, folk art and 
handcrafted furniture. Continental breakfast includes homemade muffins and 
scones. 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS: Casa de la Luna is located at 710 S. La Luna Ave., in the 
Meiners Oaks district of the Ojai Valley. From U.S. 101, take the Ojai Freeway 
to Ventura Avenue, make a left on California 150 (Baldwin Road) and a right on 
La Luna Avenue. For information and reservations, call 646-4528.

HAVANA'S STREET SCENE SUGGESTS ARGUMENTS FOR GOING BACK FOR THE AUTO OF THE 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I have a friend who envies the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks they have all the neat cars. Really. He just got back from a trip to 
Havana and he says American classics from the '50s and '60s are everywhere. An 
entire city of cars you wanted to own when you were a kid. 
</P>
<P>
He got a crick in his neck ogling all those beauties. In the original colors. 
Running fine on rebuilt engines, since no American cars or parts have entered 
the country since the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
What does this have to do with the environment? Plenty. In a minute I'll make 
the connection based on science. But first, another good reason to go out and 
buy a classic car. 
</P>
<P>
If you were a guy like me in the '50s, it was the car of your dreams. The one 
you drove to get your girl. Or the one the other guy drove to get your girl. I 
mean, are you getting a buzz thinking about that crazy '56 Chevy (or Plymouth 
or Ford . . . a good year)? I think we were crazy to junk our neat old cars. 
</P>
<P>
When you see a classic anywhere it's a head-turner, right? You also realize 
that new cars aren't that exciting. Most of them look like mobile microwave 
ovens with a weight problem. 
</P>
<P>
OK. Now for my ecological argument for buying a recycled car. Here's why you 
should go back for your car of the future. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about the family's second car. The one that's used around town 
for those short trips the deep environmentalists frown upon. According to the 
Wall Street Journal -- scarcely an advocate of not purchasing new products -- a 
classic car is "a part of the past that hasn't outlived its usefulness." Look 
in the "Autos -- Antiques and Classics" section of this newspaper's classified 
ads. Here's a way to recycle steel, aluminum, glass, plastic and rubber all at 
once. And you're buying American and helping the trade balance. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also be trading with local merchants (instead of impersonal franchises) 
because you'll be motivated to find and cultivate an independent mechanic who 
will be a person of settled ways and good standing in the community. That's an 
important "green" value (see below for example). Sales and service for classics 
owners is a terrific "networking" experience, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance? You state in the policy the cost of buying another such car if it's 
totaled. Since these are going for $5,000 to $10,000 in the vintages I'm 
excited about, it cuts your bill below new car rates. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the two biggies, environmentally speaking: (1) Buying an existing car 
-- classic or not-saves a tremendous amount of electrical energy. It means that 
industry doesn't use power making the car -- an amount of kilowatts sufficient 
to run your house for a year. (2) Gasoline is something to watch but, 
surprisingly, not something to worry about. The average car on the road today 
-- all makes and years -- gets 22 m.p.g. The classics I like get about 18. And 
the new clean-burning regular gas cuts smog emissions to EPA levels. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite, the Nash Metropolitan, now "hot" in Hollywood and praised by the 
Wall Street Journal as an investment, gets 50 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
A call to a local classic car dealer said a "nicely restored" Metropolitan is 
going for $9,950, while a "ground up" model -- totally restored with original 
parts from the ground up -- would run about $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like something Luke Skywalker would have driven as a teen-ager. It was 
the first compact convertible and I think it looks like the next compact 
convertible. This car was so far ahead of its time that its advertising 
campaign involved a driver club with the motto "Motores Prudentiores," complete 
with a coat of arms showing the resources that were conserved when you bought 
and operated the car (petroleum, iron ore, forests and cash!). 
</P>
<P>
So, whether for love or money, I think we should go back to the car of the 
future.

It's commonly mislabeled a vegetable and often sweet enough to pass for a 
fruit. It makes a pretty garnish, can be used in sauces and adds a nice touch 
to a salad. 
</P>
<P>
Red beets, those ball-shaped roots that are so versatile for cooks, are 
available year-round, but spring and summer are the best seasons to buy them at 
lower prices, said Tony Bustillos, sales representative for Seaboard Produce 
Distributors in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally red beets should be 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter, Bustillos said. They 
should have smooth skin and five to seven leaves with a medium green color and 
red veins in the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Beet leaves, Bustillos said, are a good source of vitamins A and C. 
</P>
<P>
Beets in storage require high humidity and keep best at about 32 to 34 degrees 
Fahrenheit, Bustillos said. They can last up to six weeks, but for optimal 
flavor he recommends eating them within two weeks of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
To grow them, "you've got to have the right soil," said Steve Hollister, 
general manager at Seaboard. The best is loam -- a mixture of clay and sandy 
soil. "Most beets," he said, "are grown in the coastal area." 
</P>
<P>
Another crop that flourishes near the coast is the orange, said Lyle Carson, of 
Carson Farm Supply in Ojai. "Valencias are really getting into their prime 
now," he said. They will be available through summer, Carson said, but 
currently prices for Valencias are very good. 
</P>
<P>
Also available locally are blue lake beans, a small, tender string bean that 
will be around through July, said Robbie Nichols, manager of Central Market in 
Camarillo. "You pay a bit more for the smaller beans than big beans," she said 
"but they taste better." 
</P>
<P>
Organic honey -- produced by bees that extract nectar from the blossoms of 
organically raised fruits -- is now available, said Sharon Lee, co-owner of 
Rancho Arnaz in Ventura. Organic honey is available from orange, apple and 
avocado plants. Organic honeycombs and honey with bee pollen and propolis also 
can be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for some interesting new products may want to try oat bran ribbon 
pasta from eastern Los Angeles County. The pasta is made of 51% oat bran, said 
Mike Somers, manager of Trader Joe's in Ventura. Also available is pesto spice 
pasta, which is made from enriched wheat flour, basil, garlic and other spices. 
"Usually, flavored pastas are very expensive,' Somers said, but both the pastas 
he spoke of are currently a good value. 
</P>
<P>
Nut lovers who normally favor Hawaiian macadamia nuts will want to taste 
Australian macadamia nuts, which are bigger than the Hawaiian variety, Somers 
said. They are available raw, dry-roasted and salted. 
</P>
<P>
A good local catch this week is mako, a shark from the Channel Islands, said Ed 
Lusk, co-owner of Cal Pacifica in Ventura. Also available is thresher shark 
from Santa Barbara, which can be bought at a good price, Lusk said. Shark, he 
said, is "very similar in texture and taste to swordfish." PEGGY Y. LEE

A federal grand jury in Los Angeles charged a Somis flower rancher, six foremen 
and an alleged smuggler with enslaving more than 100 Mexican laborers, forcing 
them to work for sub-minimum wages and selling them food and sundries at 
inflated prices from a company store. The defendants, including Edwin M. Ives, 
54, owner of the ranch in Ventura County, face up to 52 years in prison and $2 
million in fines if convicted, according to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
All eight defendants are charged with violating a variety of labor and civil 
rights laws, including a federal criminal anti-slavery statute, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam. She said the indictments represent only the second 
time the 81-year-old law has been used in Southern California. "This is a very 
significant case that involves very serious violations of people's human 
rights," Gillam said.

Scientists say the long-awaited Parkfield earthquake should hit Central 
California sometime within the next two years, most likely around March, 1991. 
Parkfield, which straddles the San Andreas Fault east of San Luis Obispo, has 
had moderate quakes about every 22 years, and the area has been heavily 
instrumented by scientists who hope to learn much about what happens before, 
during and after a temblor. 
</P>
<P>
The last quake hit in 1966. The quakes usually have a magnitude of about 5.5 
and do little damage in the rural area. In today's issue of the British journal 
Nature, scientists with the University of Colorado, the U.S. Geological Survey 
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report that the 
Parkfield area has been seismically quiet for some time now, suggesting that 
the fault may be storing its energy in preparation for the large quake.

Authorities said there is currently not sufficient evidence to file murder 
charges against a suspect in the shooting of a 12-year-old boy along the 
U.S.-Mexican border, but they did accuse the man of the bow-and-arrow robberies 
of two groups of illegal immigrants. The alleged robberies -- committed within 
10 minutes of each other in March and involving a total of seven victims -- are 
not connected to the murder, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Aragon. The accused, Leonard Paul Cuen, 21, whose family home is about a 
quarter of a mile north of the international boundary, is still considered a 
suspect in the May 18 murder of Emilio Eusebio Jimenez Bejines. The boy was 
gunned down about 350 yards south of Cuen's home.

Caltrans Director Robert Best has threatened to simply close the highways on 
which construction workers are exposed to traffic. Best and California Highway 
Patrol Commissioner Maury Hannigan made a joint plea to drive safely and 
soberly through highway work zones and "end the slaughter of California highway 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
In less than two months, five Caltrans workers have been killed, including two 
early this month along Interstate 5 in Stockton who were struck by a suspected 
drunk driver. The toll attributed to errant motorists is 25 since 1972. Best 
issued a statement saying: "If we can't stop the carnage, then we may have to 
curtail or eliminate night construction work, or close roads while work is 
being done. We will do whatever it takes to get this necessary work done 
without sacrificing the safety of our road workers."

LANDOWNER FILES SUIT OVER JUNGLELAND MOTEL DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Thousand Oaks landowner is suing the city because it rejected her plan to 
build a motel near the Jungleland civic center site and later entered into a 
tentative agreement with another developer to build a hotel at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to eliminate the competition for their hotel," said attorney 
Michael Cane, who filed a lawsuit against the city May 21 on behalf of 
landowner Myrna Lee Mekelburg. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying reason for denying the motel is Jungleland," Cane said. "Their 
decision was arbitrary and capricious." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the the city denyed Mekelburg's request in January, officials 
announced that they had reached a tentative agreement with Lowe Development 
Co., a Los Angeles firm that wants to build a hotel and office complex at the 
Jungleland site, according to the suit. The City Council has not yet scheduled 
a vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is going on here," Cane said. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Mark G. Sellers said Wednesday that the city's decision to deny 
Mekelburg's request to build the motel on a 2.25-acre site has nothing to do 
with the Jungleland project. He said the project would have required extensive 
grading of a hillside, something the city code prohibits. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have required the removal of 900 cubic yards of dirt," Sellers said. 
"They would have had to move the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cane said he is asking that the council's denial be overturned 
and that Mekelburg be allowed to proceed with her plans to build the motel on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard near Erbes Road. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is they're abusing this woman," Cane said. "She has spent $50,000, 
and the city is pulling the plug on it. Now what she is left with is a useless 
hunk of property." 
</P>
<P>
Cane said he plans to use a comment made by Councilman Larry Horner at a 
January meeting as evidence of the city's intention to stop the hotel 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Horner had said it would be disgusting to allow development of a motel within a 
short distance of the proposed hotel and redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
But Horner said Wednesday that his comments were not meant as an attempt to 
diminish the competition to the Jungleland hotel. He said he simply does not 
want any more hotels or motels in the city because he thinks that Thousand Oaks 
has too many already. He said he is even opposed to the Jungleland hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel is not my main concern," Horner said. "My main concern is the 
tremendous impact the development would have on the environment. I don't see 
how the council or anyone else could sanction tearing down a hill like that." 
</P>
<P>
"It's foolishness," City Manager Grant Brimhall said. "They wanted to move a 
mountain. . . . Now they're reaching for straws." 
</P>
<P>
A court date has not yet been set on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has approved building a $55.6-million government complex on 
the 20-acre Jungleland site, which is to include a new City Hall and a civic 
auditorium. Construction is scheduled to begin in May, 1991, and be completed 
in 1993.

60 OFFICERS ARREST 4 IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA PAULA: THE MEN ARE ACCUSED OF BELONGING TO A GANG SUSPECTED OF ATTACKING 
A RIVAL GANG MEMBER'S CAR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty law enforcement officers, including two SWAT teams, converged on a Santa 
Paula neighborhood before dawn Wednesday to arrest four alleged members of a 
local gang suspected of involvement in a drive-by shooting in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Renteria, 23, Arthur Banuelos, 22, Michael Banuelos, 38, and Steven 
Bracamontes, 23, were arrested without incident after a 5 a.m. search of four 
houses on Mill Street. The four, accused of belonging to the Crimies gang, are 
suspected of attacking a car driven by a member of the rival Party Boyz gang on 
May 18. 
</P>
<P>
Renteria and Arthur Banuelos, being held on $250,000 bail each, were booked in 
Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder. Bracamontes was arrested 
on suspicion of illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun and violating 
probation. He was jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail. Michael Banuelos, 38, was 
being held in County Jail without bail for violating state prison parole. 
</P>
<P>
"Communities within Ventura County have just about had it as far as gangs and 
their potential for growth go," said Lt. Pat Rooney of the Ventura Police 
Department, which organized the investigation. "We don't ever want to be in the 
same position as some of our sister counties." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the four men are suspected of chasing a car driven by alleged Party 
Boyz member Mario (Dino) Castro on May 18, about 8:20 p.m. At least three shots 
were fired at the car in the 1100 block of Citrus Drive at the eastern edge of 
Ventura, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Castro nor his passenger were injured, and both vehicles sped away to 
Santa Paula, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported the shooting and with the help of the Santa Paula Police 
Department, Ventura police officers identified Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police Cmdr. Bob Gonzales said Castro was known to police as a 
Party Boyz gang member with a history of gang affiliation. Based on his 
association with gangs, authorities were able to identify his attackers, 
Gonzalez said. During the search Wednesday, officers found 14 guns -- an AK-47, 
three handguns, two sawed-off shotguns and seven rifles and shotguns, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
SWAT teams from the Ventura Police Department and the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department were on hand, Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Participating in the arrests were officers from the Ventura Police Department, 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the Santa Paula Police Department, the 
Ventura County district attorney's office and the State Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
The police raid Wednesday morning followed a fatal shooting in Santa Paula 
Monday in which a Santa Paula man is accused of killing his next-door neighbor 
-- a shooting that police have linked to a quarrel about alleged gang activity 
involving their children. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police arrested Delfino Lopez, 43, on a murder charge Monday in the 
shooting of Samuel Ruiz. He was rearrested Wednesday, police said, allowing 
them to hold Lopez for another 48 hours while they finish reports on the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison said Lopez will be arraigned today or Friday 
in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's wife and son, speaking outside a courtroom before his arraignment was 
delayed Wednesday, said Ruiz and Lopez were the best of friends until a week 
before the shooting, when they began arguing about a fight among their sons. 
</P>
<P>
The wife and son, Martha and Freddy Joe Lopez, vehemently denied police reports 
that the shooting was gang-related, although the son, Freddy Joe Lopez, said he 
belonged to a Santa Paula gang 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Lopez said she looked out her window on Monday afternoon and saw Ruiz 
next door, drunk and yelling threats at her family. She said she saw Ruiz pull 
a gun from under his shirt, cock it and point it at her husband, Delfino Lopez, 
while the two continued arguing. 
</P>
<P>
She said she called 911 and while she was on the phone, Ruiz began shooting. 
She said her husband shot back at Ruiz, although she couldn't see him around 
the window frame. Moments later, Delfino Lopez walked into the house, without a 
gun, Martha Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he goes, 'You better get an ambulance' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have not found the weapon used to kill Ruiz. Ventura County Coroner Dr. 
F. Warren Lovell ruled that Ruiz died of a gunshot wound to the chest.

suspects in the shooting but were arrested for parole and probation violations.

AUDIT TO BE DONE AFTER ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: VOTERS WILL BE ASKED TO APPROVE A TAX INCREASE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT 
CAUSED THE TOWN'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite repeated assurances from city officials, an audit designed to uncover 
the cause of Oxnard's financial crisis will not be completed before voters go 
to the polls Tuesday to decide a 5% utility tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, scheduled to be completed Thursday, will not be done until at least 
June 19, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the utility tax increase immediately criticized the delay, saying 
it is unfair to ask voters to approve a tax increase without first proving that 
the increase is justified. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that it's reasonable to ask voters to approve the tax without 
knowing the reasons" for the fiscal crisis, said Marc L. Charney, a lawyer and 
member of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. Some opponents said they think the 
city purposely delayed publication of the audit to avoid an embarrassing report 
just before the election, a charge city officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
The 5% utility users' tax increase was designed to raise $5 million annually, 
wiping out a $2.8-million deficit in the current budget. The tax would be added 
to telephone, cable television, electricity, gas and garbage collection fees, 
and would cost the average household an extra $4 a month. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have warned that if Measure C is rejected the city will have to 
make cuts in city services and personnel, possibly including laying off police 
and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
At the recommendation of a citizens advisory committee, the city decided in 
February to pay Cresap Management Consultants of Washington, D.C., $250,000 to 
audit the city books. The results were scheduled to be released May 31. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bill G. Evans, president of Cresap, said in an interview Wednesday 
that city officials had recently raised new questions that required further 
study. He refused to say what those questions were. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe it would be in the best interest of the city to deliver an 
incomplete report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he asked city officials to extend the deadline until June 19. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, Evans said the audit will outline the reasons for the city's 
financial problems and recommend solutions. Despite the fact that the audit is 
not yet complete, Evans said, he believes that the city will need additional 
taxes to fund city services at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the City Council received Wednesday, Evans said that while the 
results of the audit "will recommend actions to reduce costs without reducing 
services, these actions, if adopted, clearly will not be sufficient to be a 
substitute for additional taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Tooker said it is up to the council to decide 
whether to penalize Cresap for failing to meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Dempsey, campaign manager for Citizens for Public Safety, a group 
supporting the tax proposal, said he does not think delaying the audit report 
will hurt the measure's chances of passage next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The city needs the revenues regardless of how it got in this shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Council candidates Paul K. Dolan and Scott Bollinger disagreed. They said it is 
vital that voters know what caused the financial crisis before they decide on 
the tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"They should know why they are giving good money to the very people that got 
them in this situation in the first place," Bollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan said he believes "deals were cut" at City Hall to delay the issuance of 
the report, a charge city officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan and Bollinger said they believe the fiscal problems are due to corruption 
and mismanagement in City Hall and mailed a letter Wednesday to the U.S. 
attorney general's office asking for a complete investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A special City Council meeting had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon to 
receive and discuss the results of the audit. City officials said the meeting 
will be held as planned.

PANEL DEADLOCKS ON CONVENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai Planning Commission deadlocked on Wednesday over a proposal to allow 
Michael Jackson's former manager to convert a Catholic convent in downtown Ojai 
into an office complex. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-2 vote by the commission amounted to a denial of the proposal by music 
promoter Frank Dileo, who once guided Jackson's career. 
</P>
<P>
The two commissioners who opposed the project said they were concerned about 
increased traffic in the residential neighborhood, where an elementary school 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
Dileo's partner, Jim Exon, said he would appeal the decision to the City 
Council. Exon and Dileo want to buy the 33-year-old St. Thomas Aquinas Convent 
at 214 Aliso St. from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which has agreed to the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Dileo and Exon propose to occupy some of the 5,196-square-foot building and 
rent out office space to other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
If Dileo and Exon succeed in convincing the City Council to overrule the 
Planning Commission, they would change the building by rebuilding the front 
walls and creating a new arched entryway, Exon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sisters of Bethany occupied the eight-bedroom convent from 1957 to 1985. 
When they stopped teaching at nearby St. Thomas Aquinas Elementary School, all 
but two of the nuns moved, said Barbara Caballero, a former nun who has been 
retained by the archdiocese as caretaker of the convent. 
</P>
<P>
Although the parish still uses the building for meetings and Friday Scripture 
readings in the summer, the archdiocese put the convent on the market last year 
for $550,000. THIA BELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS NEAR AIRPORT LOSE BID TO SUE ON 
NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Court of Appeal ruled in a decision released Wednesday that owners of 
homes near Burbank Airport have no right to sue for emotional distress or 
property damage caused by aircraft noise -- all but ending more than seven 
years of litigation on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel in Los Angeles leaves the 600 
plaintiffs from Burbank, North Hollywood and Sunland only one avenue for their 
case -- petitioning the state Supreme Court for a hearing, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs' attorney, John J. Schimmenti, estimated chances that the state 
high court would agree to hear the case as "about one out of a hundred," but 
said he did plan to petition the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of this ruling is that we have lost everything," said Tom Paterson 
of North Hollywood, one of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very strong victory," said Erich Luschei, attorney for the airport 
authority. "We got all we could have wanted."

INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of an initiative that would limit the terms of state officeholders 
and impose a cap on their expenses announced this week that they have submitted 
nearly 1 million signatures to qualify the measure for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose (of the measure) is to return the Legislature to citizen 
representation," retiring County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, one of its 
sponsors, said at a Los Angeles news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's office has until June 29 to verify the minimum 600,000 
valid signatures needed to qualify the measure, which would limit state 
senators to two four-year terms and Assembly members to three two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Two four-year terms would be the limit for the governor, lieutenant governor, 
attorney general, controller, secretary of state, treasurer, superintendent of 
public instruction and members of the Board of Equalization.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'CHEERS' STAR TO BE TRIED ON COCAINE 
POSSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys Municipal Court judge ruled Wednesday that enough evidence exists to 
try "Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer for cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb came after a Los Angeles police 
officer testified that Grammer confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine 
in his patrol car after the actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That cocaine was in my pocket. I felt stupid. I should have just told you I 
had it," Officer Michael Akana quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better 
than that. I would like to apologize to you." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubby beard, Grammer -- who plays 
the pompous psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the TV series -- looked cheerful 
as he came into court for the brief preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Grammer is serving a 30-day sentence for violating probation on an unrelated 
drunk driving conviction. Because of jail overcrowding, he will be released 
Saturday after serving 10 days.

3 ACCUSED IN THEFT OF PICKUP TRUCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three Los Angeles residents were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of stealing a 
pickup truck after police noticed a burglary tool during a routine traffic 
stop, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Flores, 24, and Patricia Ruiz, 18, were being held in the Ventura County 
Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail each, a jail spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old male arrested with them was cited to appear in Juvenile Court 
and released to the custody of his parents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Rick Barrios of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was on patrol at 
2:50 a.m. when he noticed two pickup trucks traveling south on California 126, 
said Lt. Kathy Kemp of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios stopped the rear truck and cited it for a traffic violation, Kemp said. 
Barrios then noticed a slam hammer -- an instrument often used to punch out a 
vehicle's ignition so it can be started with a screwdriver -- in the cab, Kemp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios became suspicious and broadcast a description of both trucks to fellow 
deputies, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
The front truck sped into a nearby field and two male occupants ran from it, 
Kemp said. He said one of the men is still at large. The front truck was found 
with its ignition punched out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck's registered owner was sleeping when his truck disappeared early 
Wednesday from the front of his residence on Clay Street in Fillmore, Kemp 
said. CAROL WATSON

The search for a 49-year-old Ojai man who fell off his sailboat Monday into

Crispino said.

Crispino said the only other person on the boat, a female friend of Kluckow's, 
stated that Kluckow was trying to retrieve a dinghy that had broken loose from 
the boat when he fell overboard about 12:30 p.m. Monday, about two miles off 
Mandalay State Beach.

CONTEST CITES GARDENS THAT SAVE WATER 
</P>

<P>
Drought-resistant landscapes do not have to be dominated by cactus and rocks if 
the more than 50 entries in Ventura County's Water-Efficient Landscape Contest 
are any indication. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the gardens nominated in the just-completed event were "lush, 
attractive and colorful," said Lorraine Timmons, water conservation assistant 
for the county's Water Conservation Program. 
</P>
<P>
The contest was created "to emphasize that we need water-efficient landscaping, 
given our semiarid environment, and that the landscaping doesn't have to look 
desert-like" to accomplish this, Timmons said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Timmons, who coordinated the contest, pointed to the year-old 
home of Ken and Pixie Belch of Ojai. The property on South La Luna Avenue won 
first place in the residential tract home landscape division. 
</P>
<P>
The Belches' most water-stingy plant is probably the lippia, a thick, 
attractive ground cover with tiny white and purple flowers, Timmons said. 
Instead of a thirsty lawn, lippias, which flourish in the desert, decorate the 
entire front of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Other drought-resistant plants in the garden include two Australian natives -- 
red flowers called kangaroo paws and 30-foot trees called melaleuca 
leucadendra, which are related to the eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
There are also alstroemerias -- South American native flowers with pink-purple 
blooms -- and anisodontas, bushy plants with heart-shaped leaves and small 
brown blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only beautiful, it's also easy to maintain," Pixie Belch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Belches' landscaping was designed by Martin Fletcher, a Santa Barbara 
landscape architect, and Mae Barnett, a vice president of Bay Colonies, a Santa 
Barbara company that developed five homes in the Ojai neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In another water-saving move, Bay Colonies also installed low-flow sprinkler 
heads and a drip irrigation system. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher and Barnett will be honored with other contest winners at the 
California Landscape Contractors Assn.'s Beautification Awards Banquet on 
Friday at the Oxnard Lobster Trap Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Other first-place division winners include William Worthington of Camarillo, 
residential custom home landscape and best use of native plant materials; Sam 
Williamson, superintendent, Ojai Valley Inn and Country Club Golf Course, large 
turf area; Imre and Lisa Rozsa of Ojai, hillside planting in a native oak 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
In other categories, first-prize winners include Mary Strum of Ventura, 
creative use of hardscape; the Casitas Municipal Water District, water 
conservation demonstration garden, and Beada Gamulski of Ojai, best use of 
cactus in a commercial landscape. JACK SEARLES

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOVIETS UNVEIL PLAN FOR BANKING PARTNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet officials announced Tuesday the formation of a partnership with American 
investment bankers to attract as much as $100 million in private investment to 
support the expansion of small business in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Our task is precisely to use the experience of American small businesses to 
facilitate our own growth," Valentin M. Vologhzin, chairman of the Committee 
for Economic Reforms for the USSR, told a news conference at Los Angeles City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, represented by a five-member delegation making an 11-day visit 
to Southern California, signed the agreement last month in Moscow with Acquest 
International. The agreement was expanded this week to provide for the 
formation of a $100-million capital fund that is to be matched with Soviet 
funds.

</P>
<P>
HISTORY: LANDMARK STATUS IS BEING SOUGHT FOR SITES OF LITTLE SIGNIFICANCE IN AN 
EFFORT TO PREVENT DEVELOPMENT, CRITICS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Few would deny that there is a peaceful beauty to Fryman Canyon, a wooded 
ravine in Studio City where large trees and colorful wildflowers flourish in 
the midst of the urban jungle that is Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But can acres of land virtually untouched by humans -- land where no historical 
events of note took place -- be considered culturally significant, worthy of 
city landmark status? 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city's Cultural Heritage Commission said yes, it could, and 
recommended that half of the 63-acre Fryman Canyon parcel be designated as a 
cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
But listen to the man who wrote the law giving the commission its powers: "It 
seems to me that they are interfering in private property without sound 
historical basis," said Ken Ross, 80, who in 1962 was head of the Municipal Art 
Department and helped author the Historic Preservation Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the Fryman Canyon decision illustrates how the city's cultural 
monument designation process is being abused as slow-growth activists seek new 
weapons in their ongoing battles with developers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, slow-growth groups citywide have nominated several sites 
with little apparent cultural significance as landmarks in what detractors call 
thinly veiled efforts to stop bulldozers and construction crews. 
</P>
<P>
Such trends do not come as a surprise to Ross, who recalled that tensions 
always existed between preservationists and developers. He said the 
preservation law was written with the idea that the year's delay would allow 
time to find new buyers to protect historic structures. 
</P>
<P>
The first structure to be declared a cultural landmark in Los Angeles was the 
Leonis Adobe in Calabasas in 1962, Ross recalled. The adobe was nominated when 
its fate was threatened by the landowner's plans to build a Safeway on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"That was justified. It was one of the last adobes in the valley," said Ross, 
who is fond of recalling the days when orange groves graced the Los Angeles 
Basin. "It had a great history." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most criticized recent nomination of a site involved a neighborhood 
drive to designate as a landmark a Studio City carwash where a developer 
planned to build a $15-million mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also has seriously pondered designating as a landmark a 
25-year-old white-domed theatre-in-the-round at the behest of Woodland Hills 
residents who opposed a plan to build apartments on the site. As well, panel 
members considered some World War II-vintage hangars at Van Nuys Airport -- 
nominated by a company trying to renew its lease on the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In Studio City, the residents and environmentalists who nominated Fryman Canyon 
as a potential landmark were most interested in stopping a 26-home development 
that landowner Fred Sahadi plans to build there, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are anti-growth activists recognize that this is a tool in 
their arsenal where they have very little risk of losing," said Douglas R. 
Ring, a Century City attorney who has represented developers before the 
commission, and is now suing the city over the designation of a Hollywood 
building as a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
When a site is named a landmark, it is protected from demolition or alterations 
for a year. The nomination process can delay a developer up to two months while 
the commission decides whether the property deserves such protection. 
</P>
<P>
"As carwashes and canyons will tell you, it is a process which has been 
abused," Ring said. "The rules, the limits as to how far the commission can go, 
are truly not well defined." 
</P>
<P>
Detractors of the tactic say using the commission's powers to stall projects is 
an attack on property owners' rights to use land as they see fit and undermines 
legitimate historic preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become a court of obstruction," said attorney Benjamin Reznik, who 
represents Sahadi, who will be able to construct his 26 luxury houses after all 
because the commission protected the half of his canyon where he had not 
planned construction. "It has become the panic button that people can push at 
the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners and their staff members say sites may have true historic or 
architectural value even if their nominations are prompted by other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because a tenant files an application, it may look as though the tenant 
just doesn't want to move, but it may well be that the building is 
significant," said commission staff member Nancy Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
A two-month delay for a developer is a small price to pay to guarantee that 
important sites are not inadvertently destroyed, said commission Chairman 
Amarjit Marwah. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit 
historical preservation organization, said many people seek landmark status for 
buildings when they feel they have no other recourse to stop rampant 
construction in their neighborhoods. Rounds predicted the number of such 
applications will soar as development pressure in Southern California mounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Development issues are coming face to face with legitimate environmental 
issues and there are not enough mechanisms for looking at the overall quality 
of the neighborhood," Rounds said. "I don't blame people for seizing whatever 
mechanisms they can find." 
</P>
<P>
Though commissioners generally do "a credible job of screening out things that 
are inappropriate," he said, such applications take a toll on the already 
overtaxed commission staff and resources. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, commissioners spent considerable effort on an application 
brought by members of the First Southern Baptist Church of Hollywood, who 
sought landmark status for their 1923 building. Their request followed the 
disclosure that that the block was being considered as a potential Metro Rail 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Church Pastor Gary Tibbs said he hoped that landmark status for the building, 
which once housed the first Conservative Jewish synagogue in Hollywood, would 
save the entire block from being razed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were exploring all of our options and we thought that if the commission 
landmarked the buildings then they wouldn't be able to destroy the block," 
Tibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
But Tibbs withdrew the nomination after learning that landmark designation 
could not save the former synagogue building -- much less the block -- from 
destruction, but could prevent the church from making any alterations to it. 
</P>
<P>
"They could still demolish the building even if the culture commission is 
protecting it, but if they landmark the building, you don't have any control 
over it," Tibbs said. "We didn't want the commission to tell us what to do with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Members of both the development and preservation community agree that changes 
could help the commission to function more effectively. Architects, for 
example, say the commission needs more stringent guidelines to help the panel 
determine what meets the standard of a significant site. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to clearly define what a cultural heritage building is, and what 
saving it does for the community," said architectural historian Jerry Viniegra.

TORRANCE OKS WATER FOR MARSH, IF NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprise rainstorm earlier this week dumped just enough water to dampen a 
smoldering political battle over Madrona Marsh's future. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Mother Nature's intervention, however, Torrance City Council members 
voted 5 to 2 Tuesday night, with Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker 
opposed, to let city officials add as much tap water to the parched marsh as it 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
But the heavy rain on Memorial Day weekend, which replenished a nearby drainage 
sump that supplies water to the marsh, may have at least delayed the need to 
dip into the potable water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Plans by Torrance park administrators to release between two and four acre-feet 
of domestic drinking water into the marsh -- an amount roughly equal to between 
650,000 and 1.3 million gallons -- were blocked last week by Walker, who 
believes pouring water into a marsh during a drought sets a bad conservation 
example. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, workers started the project by pumping about 230,000 gallons into 
the marsh, an amount roughly equal to what two average Torrance households 
would use in a year. 
</P>
<P>
After Walker complained, the pumping abruptly was stopped to allow council 
members time to vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
During the hiatus, Mother Nature stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody upstairs must have been looking out for us" by taking the water 
decision out of the hands of city officials "and putting it back with Mother 
Nature, where it belongs," Councilwoman Dee Hardison said. 
</P>
<P>
Although city workers were unsure of just how much rain the sump captured over 
the weekend, Parks and Recreation Director Gene Barnett said he believes the 
runoff may be just what the vernal marsh needed. Such a marsh normally dries up 
during the hot summer months, but is filled with water by fall, winter and 
spring storms. Madrona's wetlands were nearly dry last week. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be a need in the future to add additional water," Barnett told the 
council Tuesday, but because of the heavy rain Sunday night and Monday morning, 
the marsh and the sump may have received enough water. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert and other council members told the staff they should pump 
in all the water they believe is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we accepted ownership, we accepted a tremendous stewardship to maintain 
the marsh as a natural area," Geissert said. "If you change the runoff patterns 
for a piece of land like that and then you are faced with a drought, very 
likely . . . you're going to have to give the marsh some help." 
</P>
<P>
Walker complained that other alternatives, such as laying pipe for the use of 
reclaimed water or digging an on-site well, had not been thoroughly explored. 
</P>
<P>
"The city can and will sustain the marsh, but I didn't think and I don't think 
that we should be utilizing city drinking water and taxpayers' funds to do it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate, a former city Water Commission member, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing that the drought we're experiencing will probably get a lot worse 
before it gets better, I just can't" support pumping tap water into the marsh, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Roser, a retired contractor who made it his personal environmental project 
to get water for Madrona Marsh, bristled at the suggestion his efforts would 
take drinking water from the lips of Torrance residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that you and I enjoy drinking water in our swimming pools, Mr. 
Walker," Roser said before the council vote. "The better use would be for the 
flora and fauna in the marsh."

MOST CENTURY CITY JANITORS DECIDE TO WALK OFF THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the 180 janitors employed by a company that cleans the majority of 
Century City's big office towers walked out on strike late Tuesday after trying 
unsuccessfully for months to persuade the company to negotiate a union 
contract, union spokesmen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The company, International Service Systems, an international cleaning 
corporation based in Denmark, said it believed that most of the workers would 
show up for work Wednesday night and that participation in the strike will not 
be significant enough to affect the cleanliness of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Service Employees International Union Local 399 said 80% of the 
janitors were participating in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest and most dramatic tactic of the union's nationwide 
"Justice for Janitors" campaign, which has unionized many downtown office 
janitorial crews in Los Angeles but has yet to organize a building in Century 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Well-dressed office workers arriving in Century City on Wednesday morning were 
greeted at office tower parking entrances by scores of striking janitors, who, 
according to the union, make $4.50 an hour and receive no health benefits or 
sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
The union contends that a steady shift by Los Angeles building owners to 
non-union cleaning companies has cut the average janitor's hourly pay from $7 
in 1983 to near-minimum-wage levels today. Union officials say the non-union 
janitors represent millions of immigrant workers who are laboring for wages 
insufficient to pay for shelter and food in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
In many cities, the union has attempted to put public pressure on building 
maintenance companies to hire only unionized cleaning companies. That effort 
has yet to work in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're unhappy with their plight in life they can do the same thing I did 
-- change jobs," said a man who would identify himself only as a representative 
of JMB Realty Corp., which manages several office towers in Century City and 
contracts with International Service Systems. 
</P>
<P>
ISS has operations in 13 of 18 office buildings in Century City and employs 
14,000 people nationwide. It has signed union contracts in numerous other 
cities but none in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders said Wednesday they are hopeful that the strike will force ISS to 
recognize Local 399 as the workers' bargaining agent and negotiate higher 
wages. Unionized janitors in Los Angeles make $5 to $5.50 an hour as well as 
overtime and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
One striking janitor, Anna Flores, a 36-year-old single mother of five who came 
to Los Angeles from El Salvador nine years ago, said she fears losing her job 
as the result of the strike. Still, she said, she is determined to hold out for 
a union contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to win this battle. I can't feed my family on what they are paying," 
Flores said, taking from her purse a pay stub showing two-week take-home pay of 
$329.

CARSON MAN FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER OF PREGNANT NEIGHBOR; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ANTHONY HERRERA MUST BE SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE AS THE JURY 
FINDS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE SLAYING DURING ATTEMPTED RAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carson resident Anthony Herrera was found guilty Wednesday of first-degree 
murder during an attempted rape in the savage knife slaying of his pregnant 
next-door neighbor, Lisa Marie Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, 20, died April 24, 1989, after being stabbed and slashed 42 times. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera sat impassively through the reading of the verdicts in Compton Superior 
Court and left the courtroom without uttering a word. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for June 27. Herrera must be sentenced to life in prison 
without parole, having been found guilty of first-degree murder plus the 
special circumstance that the slaying occurred during an attempted rape. He 
also faces a possible consecutive sentence of 15 years to life for the death of 
the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Though Herrera could have faced execution for first-degree murder with a 
special circumstance, the district attorney's office decided before the trial 
not to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
After the first verdict -- the first-degree murder conviction -- was announced, 
two dozen family members and friends of the victim clapped and cheered briefly 
before Compton Superior Court Judge Madge S. Watai quieted the court. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking with emotion, Gonzales' mother and sister then cried silently and held 
each other through the reading of the remaining three verdicts. Gonzales' 
former fiance, Michael Corcoran, gripped the hands of friends, his face showing 
a mixture of elation, relief and rage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as happy as I can be, but it isn't good enough," said Corcoran a few 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be tortured and killed. . . . He's going to be alive and breathing, 
and he robbed Lisa and my baby of that." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sowders, head deputy district attorney in Compton, said the decision not 
to seek a death penalty was "a close call." Herrera had no previous record of 
violent crime, Sowders pointed out, and there was no evidence that he knew 
Gonzales was pregnant or that the attack was planned. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deputy Dist. Atty. Pam Frohreich, who tried the case, said Herrera 
was intoxicated that night. "It's hard to send a man to death when he was not 
himself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, the verdict of first-degree murder with a special 
circumstance means that Herrera must receive a life sentence without parole if 
the prosecution does not seek a death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Of the verdict, Joyce Dickman, Gonzales' mother, said: "We went to the court of 
justice and justice was done. . . . At least he won't be on the street to do 
this to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera's mother left the courtroom without comment. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran, 22, a self-employed construction worker from San Pedro, said he and 
Gonzales had planned to marry on the weekend after she was killed. They picked 
that date because it would have been the fifth anniversary of the beginning of 
their romance at South High School in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case was that Herrera, a 29-year-old construction worker who 
had lived next door to Gonzales and Corcoran for three years, killed her after 
she rebuffed his advances. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the murder, Herrera arrived at his house in the 21500 block of 
Water Street after hours of softball and drunken carousing to find that 
Corcoran's pickup was not parked in front of Gonzales' home. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Gonzales let Herrera into the house for a friendly 
visit and that he became violent after she rejected him. Gonzales, a former 
model, was stabbed in the face more than 30 times and hit on the head. She was 
killed by slashes across her throat, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said teeth marks matching Herrera's were found on Gonzales' 
breast, while investigators testified that footprints in Gonzales' blood were 
made by tennis shoes like the ones Herrera wore and that no other footprints 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
The defense conceded that Herrera had gone to Gonzales' house, but asserted 
that he went only after his mother told him that she had heard a commotion next 
door. He testified that he discovered the body and became bloodied while 
checking to see if his neighbor was alive. He testified that he did not call 
police because he had been smoking cocaine and feared that he would be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Ary DeGroot said his client was hurt by expert testimony that 
established that the type of blood left by the sink -- which matched Herrera's 
-- is found in only one in 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera testified that he may have left blood by the sink but had cut his palm 
earlier in the evening as he slid into second base during a softball game. But 
Frohreich said this version was not credible because the slide occurred nine 
hours before the murder and no one saw his palm bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot said the verdict would be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Monique LaTour, a Compton resident, said the jury, which began 
deliberations Tuesday morning, sifted evidence for a full day before reaching a 
consensus that Herrera was guilty of murder during an attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to send anyone to jail," she said. "but we had to work with what 
we were given."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN FOR HOUSE-SIZE SURVEYS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach City Council, still searching for a means to curb so-called 
monster houses, decided Tuesday not to survey residents and property owners 
about limiting square footage because the process would be too complicated and 
time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in a 3-2 informal vote, the council tentatively limited the floor area 
of a house to 70% of the lot size on most single-family property, excluding the 
beach area. 
</P>
<P>
The current ratio is 90%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 400 square feet would be allowed for garages on lots of 4,800 
square feet or less, and 600 square feet on larger lots. 
</P>
<P>
The council has yet to discuss other proposed controls on the bulk of 
buildings, including setbacks and yard requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The council abandoned the survey idea after consultant Michael Dyett said a 
credible survey would require personal interviews with 400 scientifically 
selected people and could take two months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, who have heard a variety of views on house sizes, said they, 
not a survey, should decide the issue. "The buck stops here," Councilman Bob 
Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will hold another meeting on zoning code revision from 2 to 6 p.m. 
June 16.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AUTOPSY ON KIDNAPED BOY INCONCLUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy has failed to determine the cause of death of an 11-year-old 
Inglewood boy who was apparently kidnaped on his way home from school last week 
and killed several hours later, a coroner's spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The initial autopsy on William J. Tillett, a fourth-grader at Bennett-Kew 
Elementary School, must be followed up with additional toxicological and 
medical studies, coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
Tillett's body was discovered behind a Hawthorne apartment building last 
Thursday evening, several hours after his parents reported to police that he 
had not returned home from school. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there were indications that Tillett had been bound but no signs of 
life-threatening trauma. No suspects have been identified, police said.

HOST FAMILIES ARE SOUGHT FOR EXCHANGE STUDENT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Education Program is seeking South Bay families and 
individuals to play host to European students who will work for local 
businesses this summer as part of an international work exchange project. 
</P>
<P>
The students are part of a statewide exchange enabling more than 200 European 
students to work in California for the summer while an equal number of 
Americans from 50 California colleges and universities go to work in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Companies employing the IEP students have included Disneyland, American Tours 
International, Prudential Bache Securities, Bank of America, Embassy Suites and 
Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
College students from West Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Finland 
have been coming to work in California for nearly 20 years. This summer, 
program officials hope to include four East German applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Participants come to California to improve their English, gain international 
work experience and learn about American culture by living with a California 
host. 
</P>
<P>
Students pay $240 for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
Interested families and individuals should call (714) 856-1005.

'MUCKRAKING' PAPERS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to thank your writer Tim Waters for his splendid article regarding 
"Silencing an Outspoken Publisher." 
</P>
<P>
We need more muckraking papers, such as The Monitor, to make the politicians 
more attentive to the people's problems. 
</P>
<P>
During the '20s and '30s, we had the great and famous muckraker (the late) 
Lincoln Steffens. Unfortunately, we do not have anyone like him now. 
</P>
<P>
I support Enrica Stuart and subscribe to her muckraking quarterly publication, 
which happens to be a thorn in the side of some politicians. In my opinion, 
periodicals like hers are important to our society and there should be one in 
every small community to keep the residents informed. 
</P>
<P>
It is Enrica Stuart's right as a citizen, resident and property owner to 
confront her City Council the same as any other person. 
</P>
<P>
Let's have more democracy than less.

BACKS PUBLISHER OF THE MONITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to congratulate Tim Waters for his article (Times, May 25) about Rancho 
Palos Verdes Mayor Mel Hughes trying to "gag" the publisher of the Monitor, 
Enrica Stuart. It is comforting to know that there are reporters around who 
will stand up and be counted! 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Mrs. Stuart cannot be both a member of the press and a 
member of the public. That is nonsense. The mayor conveniently ignores that 
Mrs. Stuart wanted to address the council as a resident, not a press person; 
she told him so twice -- I heard her. 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor has been expressing the views of many residents on the Peninsula 
and has been the only newspaper, so far, with the spunk to take on City Hall. 
The paper has been publishing well-researched articles on the issues and 
everything is properly documented. 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor's articles have never gone into the personal and private lives of 
anyone, they stick to the issues. The fact that the information they print 
often differs from the double talk we get in City Hall is what makes it so 
valuable to the community. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Enrica, the mayor is a "bully," particularly with women. I can 
vouch for that. I am one of the many victims of his rudeness and put-down.

AWARD-WINNING TEACHER GETS A LESSON IN IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Social studies teacher Alan Haskvitz is on a winning streak -- at least outside 
his own school district in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Reader's Digest named Haskvitz one of its 10 national "Heroes in 
Education," an award that carries a $15,000 prize, $10,000 of which goes to the 
school and $5,000 to the teacher. Now, Learning magazine has named the 
48-year-old teacher the recipient of its "Professional Best" leadership award. 
The honor comes with a new Oldsmobile worth $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
Haskvitz, an intense, bearded man with a knack for promoting himself and 
jousting with administrators, is gratified by his recent fame. But despite the 
recognition he has brought to Suzanne Middle School, the Walnut school district 
has repeatedly turned down his application to become a mentor teacher, a 
program through which outstanding teachers share their techniques with other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of this isn't lost on Haskvitz, who sometimes feels like a prophet 
unrecognized in his own land. "It upsets me," said the eighth-grade teacher, 
sitting during a class break with his hands neatly folded on his desk. "I sure 
would like to share." 
</P>
<P>
District officials say the mentor teacher projects submitted by Haskvitz were 
turned down because they weren't competitive. "The committee based its decision 
on the needs of the district and the needs of teachers and . . . Al's project 
fell into the cracks," said Yvonne Sevilla, Walnut's coordinator of staff 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the committee turned down Haskvitz's proposal to teach teachers the 
new social studies guidelines set forth by the state. Another rejected proposal 
was to evaluate the California Assessment Program social studies tests and lead 
teacher workshops on how to help students earn higher scores. 
</P>
<P>
One way Haskvitz raises his own student test scores is by making abstract ideas 
tangible to 13- and 14-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
"As a teacher, you get paid the same amount of money if you give kids handouts 
and textbooks," Haskvitz said. "But I try to have kids solve problems that are 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, for instance, he assigned students to write to Manuel 
Noriega as the deposed Panamanian dictator sat in a maximum-security Florida 
prison cell awaiting trial on drug trafficking and conspiracy charges. The 
object, Haskvitz said, was to get "both sides of the story" regarding the U.S. 
invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
To everyone's surprise, Noriega responded, sending back a one-page, handwritten 
letter in Spanish that sent the press swooping down on the campus. Haskvitz 
said school administrators responded by chiding him for disturbing the peace 
and failing to keep them informed of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Haskvitz and his pupils had better luck with a proposed anti-litter law, which 
they wrote and then persuaded a local legislator to sponsor in the California 
Legislature. Last week, the measure passed the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth-graders also distributed 5,000 water conservation kits in Walnut, 
which should save 23 million gallons of water this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his five years at Suzanne Middle School, Haskvitz has also assigned students 
to simplify arcane polling instructions so that voters can understand them and 
to construct board games that can be played alongside history lessons.

JIM MURRAY: HE WAS NOBODY'S ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you think of the top running back in the NFL, you figure a guy who spent 
four years at tailback for USC, a guy who had 10 Texas schools fighting over 
him when he went to high school. You're talking a guy who had a football in his 
hands since he could walk. You want him, you have to fight Notre Dame, Joe 
Paterno or Miami for him. 
</P>
<P>
What I'm saying is, the football recruiters don't hang around the secondary 
school in Enugu, Nigeria, all that much. 
</P>
<P>
They may now. Because the leading ground gainer in the NFL last season was not 
Eric Dickerson, Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, Roger Craig or even the remarkable 
rookie, Barry Sanders. Or, any other product of American sandlots. In point of 
fact, it was a guy who never heard of the NFL growing up, who didn't even know 
what a football looked like. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Okoye is the unlikeliest football hero this side of a Hollywood 
script. The first football game he ever saw, he was in. 
</P>
<P>
He came to this country as a track athlete. In his native Nigeria, he somehow 
managed to perfect a decent form in the discus and the hammer and won whatever 
meets his war-ravaged country was able to stage. 
</P>
<P>
It's not revolutionary for football players to be recruited from track teams. 
Red Grange, no less, was a champion hurdler who was ordered to go out for 
football by his fraternity brothers. George Gipp left track for the football 
field to feed his gambling habit. But, they had laid eyes on a football before. 
They had kicked or thrown one in play. 
</P>
<P>
The first American football that Christian Okoye saw, he thought was broken. 
"Why isn't it round?" he complained. "That's not a ball. It's been run over." 
</P>
<P>
He came to little Azusa Pacific University to escape the tribal strife that 
devastated his homeland. The tribe to which he belonged, the Ibos, tried to 
secede from the government at Lagos and form their own Republic of Biafra. In 
the resultant civil war, Biafra became an international symbol for suffering 
and starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was residual animosities from the civil war that turned Okoye to 
football. Despite his world-class marks in the discus and weight throws, he was 
left off the Nigerian Olympic team in 1984. That put into jeopardy his future 
in returning home as a coach one day. Old enmities would not die. 
</P>
<P>
So, Christian Okoye presented to the football staff at Azusa Pacific a 
260-pound, 6-foot-1-inch body that could run the 40 in 4.4, the hundred in 
10.15 and was used to pain and suffering. The only thing he had to learn was 
how to grip that funny object they called a ball. They tell the story of the 
first time he hit a line, and the dazed linebacker picked himself up. 
</P>
<P>
"Where'd they get that?!" the linebacker demanded. "He's from Africa," he was 
told. "Oh, yeah?" was his reaction. "How'd they get the stripes off him?" 
</P>
<P>
He was as unstoppable as lava. When told his African nickname was Cho Cho, a 
defensive lineman had a better idea. "His nickname should be 'Ow!' " he 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
He ran for 3,569 yards and 34 touchdowns in college. His school won the NAIA 
track meet every year he was there. His time in the hundred, 10.15, would have 
won the Moscow Olympics, and his time in the 200, 20.5, was the NAIA record. 
</P>
<P>
But speed and power in Division III football is greeted with cautious 
skepticism by NFL scouts. It often evaporates in competition where everyone 
runs the 40 in 4-plus and most people weigh 260 or more. Besides, there was 
that lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
As his fame grew, ignorance about Africa surfaced. Did he have to watch out for 
lions on his way to school? Do people wear bones in their noses? Okoye laughs. 
"They wear more things in their ears here than we do in Africa." Enugu is 
actually bigger than Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
Okoye was hardly a secret, but NFL general managers did not sit up and consult 
their draft lists till Okoye ran for four touchdowns in the Senior Bowl in 
1987. Then, the Kansas City Chiefs traded up 11 places to draft him. 
</P>
<P>
A cheerful, modest, deeply religious man, Okoye goes through a football game as 
he goes through life -- with a smile on his face. If he leads the Chiefs to the 
Super Bowl, the NFL may conclude the experts were wrong. There's still plenty 
of ivory in Africa. Only not in tusks, in helmets and pads.

<P>
The slumping Dodgers lost their third consecutive game Wednesday, 5-3 to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, and face the start of their most important series to date. 
</P>
<P>
But they can take heart in one thing. The Cincinnati Reds aren't the only hot 
property coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson could be on his way, too. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say if Gibson's knee feels well this morning after his fifth 
rehabilitation start for triple-A Albuquerque on Wednesday night, he could be 
the center fielder in the Dodger lineup tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ruling that possibility out," said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers cannot afford to rule anything out. Wednesday's loss marked only 
the second time the Dodgers have been swept in a three-game series this season, 
and the first time they have been nine games behind the National League 
West-leading Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who has not played since July and had surgery on his left knee Aug. 29, 
has spent the past week exposing his knee to nearly every baserunning 
situation, and found it healthy. He has also hit well for Albuquerque, although 
his bat strength was never in question. 
</P>
<P>
He played seven innings and stole his first base for Albuquerque on Tuesday. On 
Wednesday morning, the knee felt good, and the Dodgers decided he could be 
ready after one more game. He went one for three with a double and a run batted 
in as a designated hitter Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He has run from first to third base, he has gone back to second base after 
taking a big lead, he has been upbeat to the point where, all the signs are 
good," Claire said. "But we are dealing with the reality of, the knee has to 
feel fine the next day after he plays. It is quite literally on a day-to-day 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not pushing him just to be ready for the start of the Cincinnati 
series. He has to be comfortable. But so far, he has recovered well. He is very 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Claire was scheduled to speak with Gibson late Wednesday night and this 
morning, during which a decision will probably be made. If Gibson is not ready 
today, he should arrive during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said that Gibson will play center field, though he has struggled there 
in Albuquerque, making two errors. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we are aligned, that is the best position for him," Claire said of 
Gibson. "Kal (Daniels) is not someone who can play center field, and Kirk has 
played there before. The way it is, we really don't have a better idea." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gibson's bat and inspiration are greatly needed, it would be nice if 
he could reach into his bag and find a Gold Glove. The Dodgers lost Wednesday's 
game not because starter Ramon Martinez allowed eight hits in four innings, but 
because of poor defense. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Samuel booted the first ball the Pirates hit, allowing a ground ball by 
Wally Backman to bounce off his glove at second base and roll into the 
outfield. Mike Scioscia was called for catcher's interference one out later 
when his glove tipped the bat of Andy Van Slyke. 
</P>
<P>
What could have been three outs was one out, a fact appreciated by Bobby 
Bonilla, who followed with a run-scoring single, and Barry Bonds, who hit a 
two-run home run to give the Pirates a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later, the Dodgers faltered again. Bonilla's fly ball to left field 
took an unusual bounce over Daniels' head, giving Bonilla a triple. 
</P>
<P>
With Bonilla racing home on the sound of the bat hitting the ball, Bonds hit a 
potential double-play grounder to Martinez. But Martinez's throw to Murray at 
first base was high, barely good enough for one out. Murray, forced to hurry, 
had trouble getting the ball out of his glove and was late with the throw home, 
allowing Bonds to score. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Bream followed with a home run to make it 5-0. With Dodger hitters failing 
in the clutch, the game was essentially over. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not Ramon's fault we lost this game," Scioscia said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus a team that came within three outs of winning six consecutive games, as 
the Dodgers were in the ninth inning here Monday, were outscored, 20-8, in the 
next 19 innings and lost three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Despite winning five of eight games on the trip, the Dodgers have lost ground 
to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think once we go home, things will be all right," the Dodgers' Mickey 
Hatcher said, pausing. "Well, hopefully. Talk to me in two days." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sharperson wasted the Dodgers' best and final chance at a comeback 
Wednesday when he was struck out by Ted Power with runners on second and third 
and two out in the seventh. It was just Sharperson's 11th strikeout this 
season. "No excuses, but with the starting time (5 p.m. EST), it was really 
hard to see the ball," Sharperson said. "I couldn't pick it up at all." 
Sharperson wasn't the only one complaining about the shadows caused by the 
starting time, which was implemented so the Dodgers would have time to fly home 
for tonight's game. "I'd rather have my wisdom teeth pulled than play at 5 
o'clock," said the Pirates' Andy Van Slyke, who made two errors in center 
field. "And I've had my wisdom teeth pulled." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said Wednesday that contrary to television reports, 
he is not feuding with Vice President Fred Claire and is not a candidate to 
become the next permanent manager of the New York Mets. "Fred Claire and I are 
very good friends, I enjoy working for Fred Claire, I love my job, I am the 
happiest guy in the world." Lasorda did not deny the foundation of the report 
-- that he has not received an extension on a contract that expires after this 
season. "But I'm not thinking about that now," Lasorda said. "I've got a job to 
do. I'm thinking about 1990."

DENT HAS HIS OWN TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Bucky Dent woke up Tuesday as the second-likeliest manager of a New York 
baseball team to be out of a job by nightfall. By dinnertime, he had moved up 
one place. 
</P>
<P>
When the messengers brought Dent news of Davey Johnson's unscheduled-scheduled 
departure from the Mets, he was standing a few feet behind the batting cage as 
the shadows of a cool evening lengthened across Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
He was hardly surprised. No manager ever is -- and those who wear New York 
Yankee pinstripes are surprised least of all. Then the messengers reminded Dent 
that earlier this year, Johnson's name was on the short list owner George 
Steinbrenner keeps by his nightstand. 
</P>
<P>
"I have too many other things to worry about," Dent said. As he talked, he kept 
pushing his fingers deeper into a child-sized fielder's glove. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's going to happen, it's going to happen. ... Why should I worry about it 
every day?" 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. On the other hand, Tuesday turned out to be one of those days when 
there was plenty to worry about if you happened to be managing the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
There was the matter of last place, of losing three straight, and by nightfall 
of knowing that somewhere in the sky above Comiskey Park, behind the glass of 
one of those climate-controlled luxury boxes, lurked Steinbrenner, watching the 
skid extend to four. And fuming. 
</P>
<P>
Dent took over the sinking ship last August from Dallas Green, who got it from 
Lou Piniella, who got it from Billy Martin, who got it from Piniella before 
giving it back to him. But then, Billy Martin did that with a few people. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Dent has seen 83 games go by on his watch, and he has lost 48 of 
them. The latest, but by no means the most creative, came Tuesday night in the 
bottom of the ninth when reliever Lance McCullers, who threw three wild pitches 
in just eight warmup tosses, uncorked yet another one when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning, though, wasn't much better. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee shortstop Alvaro Espinoza turned what might have been a close play into 
a double by wild-throwing Lance Johnson's leadoff grounder to first. After 
Robin Ventura singled, starter Mike Witt hit Carlton Fisk with a pitch. A 
moment later, Witt hit catcher Bob Geren with a pitch. As luck would have it, 
though, Geren was using the wrong side of his mitt at the time. The passed ball 
gave the White Sox their first run. They had three more before Witt retired a 
batter. 
</P>
<P>
There was more. Left fielder and part-time NFL cornerback "Neon" Deion Sanders, 
fittingly, did the work of two men. Unfortunately, he got his sports crossed. 
In the second, he knocked down a fly ball (though it was scored a hit and 
Chicago failed to capitalize). In the seventh, he walked with two out, stole 
second and, for reasons Dent is still trying to fathom, tried to gain the extra 
yard. Instead, he got caught trying to steal third. 
</P>
<P>
Bucky Dent didn't pitch, catch or hit a ball Tuesday night, didn't rush "Neon 
Deion" into the bigs, didn't rain money on such questionable talents as Pascual 
Perez and Andy Hawkins while scaring genuine talent away, or fray the nerves of 
Don Mattingly and Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
But who is left holding the bag for these and varied other offenses? 
Steinbrenner? His mysterious baseball operatives? 
</P>
<P>
No. Bucky Dent. The same guy whose job is not as secure as the current manager 
of the Big Red Machine. Not Lou Piniella in Cincinnati -- Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a tough spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Bucky," the post-mortem ended, "how do you accept a loss like this?" 
</P>
<P>
"You don't accept them. You tolerate them." 
</P>
<P>
"Is there anything you can say to them after a game like this?" 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to them before the game," he said. "I told them, 'We're hustling, 
we're battling back. It seems we just can't get the big hit.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then we get the big hit (a game-tying home run by Mel Hall to open the 
ninth)," he finished. "And something like this always happens." 
</P>
<P>
As Roseanne Roseannadana, the "Saturday Night Live" character created by the 
late Gilda Radner, used to say, it's always something. And Steinbrenner, if he 
was really paying attention Tuesday night, should know that the something isn't 
always the manager. Or Dave Winfield. Or whomever the 
paper-tiger-for-the-moment happens to be. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Jeff Torborg took over the Chicago White Sox in November 1988 
after 10 years working for The Boss as a pitching coach, bullpen coach, bench 
coach, third-base coach, "everything you can coach but hitting," he said, "and 
if you ever saw me hit, you can understand why." 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to New York, he managed Cleveland for parts of three seasons 
(1977-79) and was 157-201 over that span. His first season in Chicago went no 
better (69-92, last in the AL West), but owner Jerry Reinsdorf made clear the 
panic button had been put out of sight and this year's White Sox team has 
become one of the biggest surprises in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Lack of continuity definitely hurts players. If they know what you're 
preaching is going to be in place for a while, they all won't be happy, but at 
least they're going to know what is expected of them," Torborg said. 
</P>
<P>
"You change guys, it's 'Try this approach, try that approach,' and all you've 
got is confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really bad in the first half (of 1989), we steadied in the second 
half, and we've played with a lot of poise in the first quarter of this one. 
There's no guarantee it's going to go along all year like this, but we believe 
we're headed in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you could do that in New York. In New York," Torborg said, 
"it's win now." 
</P>
<P>
Or else. Bucky Dent almost certainly won't get a glimpse of the promised land 
when the Yankees get there. That's assuming they find their way out of the 
wilderness first.

The Southeastern Conference's 10 member schools voted unanimously to authorize 
Commissioner Roy Kramer to enter formal discussions with schools interested in 
joining the league. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no timetable," Kramer said. "It could be fairly rapidly, and it could 
run its course over a period of several months, a year, or more." 
</P>
<P>
If the league does expand, it is expected to add at least two teams because of 
scheduling considerations. Divisional play in football also would be a 
possibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Gavitt, commissioner of the Big East Conference and head of amateur 
basketball in the United States, moved to the pro ranks Wednesday by accepting 
a challenge to rebuild the Boston Celtics as their director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
Gavitt, former coach at Dartmouth and Providence, was given a five-year 
contract. 
</P>

I'm coming from." 
</P>
<P>
Gavitt, 52, will remain as president of the U.S. Amateur Athletics Basketball 
Assn. until after the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, Spain.

CRAWFORD SENTENCED, SAYS HE'LL TRANSFER FROM UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Crawford, formerly a UCLA free safety, pleaded no contest to simple 
assault and was sentenced to 60 days in the Los Angeles County Jail Wednesday 
in Beverly Hills Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Crawford, 20, was placed on formal probation for two years and 
fined $250. Crawford and two others also were ordered to pay $410 in 
restitution to the victim, Edilberto Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, speaking publicly for the first time in almost a year, said he will 
begin his jail term about June 20. Although suspended from the UCLA football 
team since August, Crawford is still a student at the school. He will conclude 
the spring quarter on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, the son of former Dodger star Willie Crawford, was arrested in 
October by West Hollywood police when he and two friends -- Kevin Bourtin and 
Lincoln Sneed -- allegedly struck Munoz during an altercation in the middle of 
an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Bourtin and Sneed testified that Crawford tried to break up the fight in which 
Munoz was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Jonlyn Callahan, a deputy district attorney, said the defendants gave 
conflicting reports to police and probation officers about the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence all three were involved," she said. "Who was more culpable is 
difficult to say." 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Talcott, Crawford's attorney, said he was disappointed with the jail 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford appeared before the same judge, Charles Rubin, last August when he was 
convicted of misappropriation of stolen property. He was placed on summary 
probation for that charge, and shortly thereafter was suspended from the Bruin 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, a 6-foot, 200-pound athlete who excelled at Beverly Hills High 
School, never played a down for UCLA. He was a redshirt freshman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday he is transferring to the University of Houston, where former 
Bruin assistant coach Larry Coyer recently was named defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford is leaving UCLA with bittersweet memories. He recently was informed 
that his scholarship would not be renewed for the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically turned their back on me when I got into trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent two years here; it hasn't been two good years. I regret not leaving 
last summer." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford admits he was involved in both incidents but said UCLA athletic 
officials did not consider his side in the assault case. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the type of school that forgives and forgets," he said. "The 
athletic department decided I was a bad risk for the program." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said, however, that football Coach Terry Donahue and Athletic Director 
Peter Dalis were honest in dealing with him. 
</P>
<P>
After the first incident, Crawford was told he would have to sit out another 
year or attend a community college before getting the chance to return to the 
Bruin program. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie was extremely well liked by all the players and coaches at UCLA," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"And we really feel sad for him and his family because of the effects of this 
whole incident. We wish him well in his new endeavors."

CHATSWORTH WINS 4-A CITY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago today, 29-year-old Tom Meusborn was sorting through the roster of 
the Grant High junior varsity team, trying to figure out which ninth graders 
were strong enough to throw a ball 60 feet six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Today, meet Tom Meusborn, coach of the 1990 City Section 4-A champions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in shock," Meusborn said. "It was a great, great, great, great first 
year." 
</P>
<P>
With one bold stroke, Meusborn and Chatsworth squeezed the life out of favored 
El Camino Real, 3-2, when shortstop Tommy Lee laid down a flawless bunt with 
the bases loaded to score Nestor Martinez and record one of the more improbable 
finishes to an improbable story in recent City championship history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time all year we've run a suicide squeeze," Meusborn said. 
</P>
<P>
Meusborn, the second straight rookie coach to win a City title (Kennedy's Manny 
Alvarado won in 1989), did it for a school that last won a City title in 1983 
and spent the last six years enduring semifinal defeat after semifinal defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to keep it as close as possible and let the guys clutch up and do 
what they had to do," senior Reed McMackin said. "We beat the best, that makes 
us the best." 
</P>
<P>
Meusborn brought to the program a surge of energy as well as an innocence, 
ready for new adventure. One such beneficiary was senior McMackin, the only 
leftover from Chatsworth's 1988 team, a team ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA 
Today before losing a semifinal game. BRIAN MURPHY

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
A'S GO TO BENCH, BEAT BLUE JAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Canseco and Rickey Henderson are having great seasons, but the Oakland 
Athletics continue to lead the American League West because of consistent 
clutch performances from their bench. 
</P>
<P>
With regular catcher Terry Steinbach slumping at .198, A's Manager Tony LaRussa 
decided it was time to give Jamie Quirk a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Quirk, making only his second start, drove in two runs with a double and triple 
at Oakland as the A's beat the Toronto Blue Jays, 8-5, to avoid a series sweep 
and end the Blue Jays' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Quirk, who has played 12 years in the major leagues, passed on a contract with 
the Baltimore Orioles to play for the defending World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orioles made me an offer, but the A's gave me a guaranteed contract," 
Quirk said. "I'm 34 years old with a wife and kid. It was nice to know if 
things didn't work out here, I'd still get paid for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to be sitting on a major league roster, it might as well be on 
the best team in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Quirk, who entered the game one for 10, broke a 5-5 tie in the A's four-run, 
fifth inning with a run-scoring double. He gave Oakland a 1-0 lead with a 
run-scoring triple in the first. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a quality major leaguer," LaRussa said. "If this was the last day 
of the season with the pennant at stake and he was our catcher, I'd have no 
problem putting him out there." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Burns (1-0) earned the victory, pitching 3 1/3 innings in relief of Curt 
Young. Dennis Eckersley got the last three outs for his 14th save in as many 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph hit his first home run for the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Lee and Junior Felix hit consecutive homers for the Blue Jays for the 
second time in four games to start the four-run Toronto rally in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, New York 2 -- Scott Fletcher hit a three-run homer and Sammy Sosa 
added a solo shot at Chicago as the White Sox won their fifth consecutive game 
and swept the Yankees for the first time since April 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, batting .202, hit his first home run in 134 at-bats this season. It 
was his 18th homer in 3,402 at-bats during his career. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox got only four hits but improved to 18-6 at Comiskey Park, best 
home record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hibbard (4-3) allowed four hits in 7 1/3 innings. Bobby Thigpen finished 
the combined five-hitter for his 16th save in 19 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Cary (2-1) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Balboni hit his fourth homer for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, Detroit 3 -- The Royals defeated Detroit for the 10th 
consecutive time at Royals Stadium as the bullpen held off the Tigers after an 
injury to starter Storm Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis left with two out in the fourth with a bruised knuckle after stopping 
Cecil Fielder's hard grounder. Luis Aquino (1-0) pitched 2 1/3 scoreless 
innings and Steve Crawford worked two shutout innings. Jeff Montgomery pitched 
the ninth for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Petry (4-2) took the loss and dropped to 5-12 lifetime against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Ward hit his third homer for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 4, Boston 3 -- The Rangers ended their team-record nine-game home losing 
streak when Pete Incaviglia doubled home the winning run with one out in the 
10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Franco led off the 10th with a single -- his third hit of the game -- 
then stole second before scoring on Incaviglia's double off Wes Gardner (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brown held Boston to six hits through nine innings. Kenny Rogers (2-1) 
pitched the 10th for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs ended a two-for-20 slump with a solo homer, his second, in the 
Boston third. 
</P>

Minnesota 12, Baltimore 3 -- Fred Manrique and Brian Harper drove in three runs 
apiece at Minneapolis as the Twins improved to 20-7 this month, their best May 
ever.

<P>
Gene Larkin had three of the Twins' 16 hits against four Oriole pitchers. 
Larkin has hit in seven consecutive games, batting .542.

<P>
Cal Ripken hit his seventh homer for the Orioles, his first since May 12.

GIANTS' BURKETT BOWLS OVER CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Burkett is used to throwing strikes in the bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
And this season, the right-hander is also doing it on the mound for the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett, a rookie who spent seven years in the minor leagues, gave up five hits 
in eight innings and singled in a run with his first major league hit to lead 
the Giants to a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs Wednesday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"During the lockout I bowled in tournaments and picked up about $1,500," said 
Burkett, who has a 225 average and three 300 games. "I once thought of being a 
professional bowler, but I'm glad I decided on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Burkett (4-1) took a shutout into the eighth before Ryne Sandberg hit his 10th 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good pitcher," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "Every pitch is a 
purpose pitch. He works fast and throws strikes and keeps the ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
Burkett singled in a run with two out in the second inning. The Giants added 
three more in the third on a run-scoring single by Kevin Mitchell and Matt 
Williams' ninth homer, which was hit into the left-field bleachers against a 
21-m.p.h wind. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Shawn Boskie (1-2) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 9, Atlanta 6 -- The victory at Atlanta was a costly one because three 
Expo pitchers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez, Montreal's scheduled starter, reported a stiff neck while 
warming up and was replaced by Bill Sampen. Reliever Dave Schmidt (1-0) allowed 
three hits in 2 2/3 innings in relief of Sampen, but left in the seventh after 
one of Ron Gant's three hits caromed off his leg. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Burke left the game after injuring his right ankle covering first base in 
the ninth. Drew Hall, the fifth Montreal pitcher, got the last out for his 
second save. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach paced the Expos, driving in four runs with his 11th home run and 
two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The homer was Wallach's 19th against the Braves, 14 of them coming in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Martinez also hit a home run for the Expos, his first. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Justice and Gant hit their second and seventh homers, respectively, for 
the Braves, who suffered their fifth defeat in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Glavine (2-3) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 8, Philadelphia 3 -- Bip Roberts, Tony Gwynn, Mike Pagliarulo and Joe 
Carter each drove in two runs at Philadelphia as the Padres won for the third 
consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie first baseman Jerald Clark had the first four-hit game of his career and 
the Padres had 13 against Bruce Ruffin (3-5) and three relievers. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres put the game away in the fourth when they sent 11 batters to the 
plate and scored five runs. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes (5-4), who spent most of last season in double A, improved to 4-0 
against the Phillies, giving up seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Greg Harris earned 
his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Carter hit his eighth homer for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Jordan hit his third homer and Von Hayes his eighth for the Phillies, who 
have lost four consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 2, St. Louis 1 -- Glenn Wilson drove in the game-winning run in the 
eighth inning at Houston as the Astros won for the sixth time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Caminiti, who doubled off Joe Magrane (2-8) with one out in the eighth, 
scored the go-ahead run after second baseman Jose Oquendo slapped down Wilson's 
hit and made a late throw to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Juan Agosto (4-1) pitched one inning for the victory after replacing 
Mike Scott, who gave up seven hits and struck out three in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Smith worked the ninth for his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, last in the National League East, lost for the fifth time in six 
games.

UNIONS SELECT CHRYSLER OFFICER TO HEAD UAL; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: GERALD GREENWALD, HEIR APPARENT TO LEE IACOCCA AT THE NO. 3 AUTO 
MAKER, IS SEEN AS A RESPECTED OUTSIDER CAPABLE OF LEADING THE WORKERS' BUYOUT 
EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Air Lines' three major unions bolstered their attempted employee buyout 
of the airline's parent corporation Wednesday by announcing that Chrysler Vice 
Chairman Gerald Greenwald, Lee A. Iacocca's heir apparent, has agreed to become 
chief executive of the newly constituted venture. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made in Detroit, signaled that the unions had succeeded in 
their goal of finding a respected executive outside the aviation industry to 
bring the buyout effort -- aimed at creating the nation's largest worker-owned 
company -- to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald's first and most critical challenge will be to find financial 
institutions willing to bankroll the buyout. UAL's board has given the unions 
until Aug. 9 to raise half of the money needed to complete the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
UAL agreed two months ago to be purchased by its 71,000 employees for $4.38 
billion. But financing was regarded as a stumbling block, particularly because 
an earlier buyout effort last fall, made jointly by management and some 
employee groups, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Persuading Greenwald to head the acquisition effort and then the corporation is 
a major victory, said John Peterpaul, vice president of the International Assn. 
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one of the unions that will have a seat on 
the board of the newly formed company. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is well-respected, he's run companies, he's internationally known. He 
knows the financial community. He's worked with labor. I think he'll fit 
perfectly in the new work ethic we're trying to bring to UAL," Peterpaul said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Peterpaul said negotiations with financial institutions, coordinated by Salomon 
Bros. and Goldman Sachs, had begun earlier this week. It is likely that 
financing will come through several institutions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A written statement released by the machinists and United's pilots and flight 
attendants unions said Greenwald will serve as the head of the "acquisition 
corporation" previously formed by the unions and that he will become chairman 
and chief executive officer of UAL once the acquisition is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald, 54, spent 22 years in a variety of positions at Ford Motor Co. In 
1979, he became vice president and controller of Chrysler and won in praise in 
the 1980s for his role in helping Chrysler recover from near-bankruptcy. He was 
named vice chairman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to take the UAL job came as a surprise because he had been 
regarded as Iacocca's likely successor. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been a situation in which he got an offer he couldn't refuse. Or 
it could be that he believed Lee would be staying (as chairman) longer," 
speculated Chris Cedegren, director of corporate assessment for J. D. Power 
&amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills firm that analyzes the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald's decision to leave could motivate Iacocca, 65, who had been expected 
to retire in late 1991, to remain in charge of Chrysler for another two years, 
Cedegren said. Iacocca has hinted in recent interviews that he may want to 
extend his stay. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said in a prepared statement that he felt "privileged to be part of 
the turnaround and then the rebuilding" of Chrysler but added, "I can't turn 
down . . . an opportunity to lead another great company during a period of 
major transition." 
</P>
<P>
"He's told me that it's time for him to run his own show," Iacocca said in a 
statement. "Jerry will leave a big hole in our management lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Once the purchase is completed, UAL shareholders will get cash and company IOUs 
valued at $201 a share. To make the deal work, unions have promised $2 billion 
in wage and other concessions over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is unusual not only because of its size, but because it 
involves 100% employee ownership. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf reportedly fought the employee buyout plan but 
ultimately relented. UAL's board was forced to choose between selling the 
nation's second-largest airline to workers or facing a proxy fight with UAL's 
largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, that could have ousted the carrier's 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate our union leaders for recruiting someone of Jerry Greenwald's 
stature," Wolf said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout must be finalized by year-end, according to the agreement between 
the unions and the board. 
</P>
<P>
The new UAL board would consist of three members of the airline's new top 
management, eight independent outside directors and four others, representing 
the three unions and the non-contract employees. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction has been applauded by officials of organized labor, who for 
years have attempted to encourage employee buyouts of company through existing 
employee stock ownership plans. In March, Connecticut-based Colt Firearms was 
sold in a deal put together by the United Auto Workers and financed largely 
through the Connecticut state employees pension fund. The buyout, which gave 
the UAW three seats on an 11-member board, enabled the union to end a bitter 
four-year strike against Colt. 
</P>
<P>
United Air Lines' pilots began the quest of employee ownership three years ago 
when they offered $4 billion for the airline. But that effort lay dormant until 
late last year, when financier Marvin Davis attempted to buy the airline. That 
effort also failed, and last September a combination of UAL managers, United's 
pilots and flight attendants and British Airways made an offer. Word that the 
financing for that deal was in trouble last October was blamed for a 190-point 
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. The deal officially collapsed on Oct. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
UAL reported a first-quarter loss of $36.4 million on revenue of $2.19 billion.

LEAN LASORDA GOES FOR THE FENCES, TAKES SAUCE FIRM PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cubs and Pirates fans may hate the Dodgers, but Tommy Lasorda is betting that 
they'll love his spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley-based company that markets sauces under the name of the 
pasta-loving Dodger manager announced a merger deal Wednesday that will make 
Lasorda Foods Inc. a public company and provide the capital to put its product 
on grocery shelves from Florida to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at expanding our sales from 40,000 cases a month to 100,000 
cases a month," said Steven Fox, president of Lasorda Foods, which markets the 
recipe handed down from the manager's mother. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, Lasorda Foods will exchange all of its outstanding common 
shares -- the majority owned by Lasorda and his wife Jo -- in return for 4.6 
million shares of Discovery Capital Corp., a public company based in Englewood, 
Colo. The surviving entity in the merger will be Lasorda Foods. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said that transaction will mean that Lasorda Foods will become a publicly 
traded company and have immediate access to more than $1.5 million for 
expansion and new product introduction. The Lasordas will continue to own about 
80%, and current management should remain in place after the transaction 
becomes final June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda Foods was formed in June, 1988, to market a line of Italian food 
products endorsed by Lasorda. In August, 1989, the company began selling its 
homemade pasta sauces in grocery stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will allow Lasorda to try to pitch his lineup against the national 
league of "designer" pasta sauces. The manager's old family recipe already 
faces off locally against actor Paul Newman's "Newman's Own" and will soon have 
singer Frank Sinatra's brand to contend with. And that's besides such 
well-known national brands as Ragu and Prego. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, sounding as optimistic as Lasorda is on opening day of spring training at 
Vero Beach, Fla., counters that the manager's sauce tastes better than its many 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be very willing to have a public taste test, like the old Pepsi 
challenge. The one thing with the Lasorda sauce is, once they try it, they'll 
buy it again," he boasted. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said he wants to expand the company's products to places where Lasorda is 
known and liked, even if the Dodgers go on a winning streak against the local 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy is a national sports figure," Fox said. "We know he's very popular in 
Florida and Chicago and Pennsylvania (where Lasorda grew up). These are areas 
where we are going to create a demand for the product." 
</P>
<P>
In addition its sauce, the company plans to introduce a line of fresh pastas. 
Te sauce will be sold in 64-ounce bottles, in addition to the 25-ounce size. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said he doesn't expect any trouble from Lasorda's appearance in television 
advertisements for a liquid diet, in which the slimmed-down manager stands next 
to a large likeness of himself with a pot belly. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lasorda drinks the diet milkshake for two meals, "he still eats pasta 
every day," Fox said reassuringly.

A VICIOUS RAG WAR'S BIZARRE CONCLUSION; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE CREATORS OF GUESS JEANS WON'T PAY A $10-MILLION BOUNTY TO THEIR 
SUPERSTAR LAWYER, WHO IN TURN FILES A $17-MILLION LIEN. IS THE FIGHT REALLY 
OVER?

<P>
It was, perhaps, the only way that this lawsuit could have ended. 
</P>
<P>
After a 6 1/2-year legal free-for-all, the Marciano brothers, creators of Guess 
jeans, won back full control Wednesday of that garment industry gold mine from 
their archenemies, the Nakash brothers, founders of Jordache. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than giving rise to unvarnished celebration, the settlement of the 
rag war only opened the door to more contention -- this time between the 
mercurial Marcianos and their superstar attorney, Marshall B. Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcianos, who cast off at least three high-priced law firms before 
settling on Grossman to mastermind their case through five years of legal 
wrangling and two protracted Superior Court trials, turned to other powerhouse 
lawyers at the 11th hour to negotiate a settlement with the Nakashes. 
</P>
<P>
And not only did the Marcianos charge, in the aftermath, that Grossman tried to 
block the settlement, they declared that they would not pay the $10-million 
bounty they'd promised him if he restored their control of Guess. 
</P>
<P>
So, hours after the Marcianos sauntered into court singing the praises of 
Howard L. Weitzman, the Nakashes' attorney, and wearing lapel buttons 
emblazoned with his name, sources said Grossman filed a $17-million lien 
against the Marcianos' proceeds from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of day, in other words, that Los Angeles trial lawyers, who had 
watched the case intently, could only term "bizarre" and "incredible." 
</P>
<P>
"As one of the lawyers described it at one point, being a lawyer in this case 
was like riding a bucking bronco," said Daniel J. Woods, one of the succession 
of lawyers who represented the Nakashes in the Guess-Jordache imbroglio. 
"Sooner or later all the lawyers were going to get thrown out of the saddle." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, it seems, landed with quite a thump. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most feared trial lawyers in Los Angeles, he was the victor in 
celebrated cases against Playboy Enterprises, movie mogul Marvin Davis and 
sports agent Mike Trope. Last year, Grossman convinced a Los Angeles jury that 
the Nakashes had defrauded the Marcianos when they first became partners in 
Guess. That verdict set the stage for the trial that ended abruptly Wednesday, 
in which a jury was already deliberating how much the Nakashes owed the 
Marcianos for their misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Those successes seemed forgotten by the Marcianos, who had no good words for 
the lawyer they till lately could not stop praising. 
</P>
<P>
"He did everything possible to derail the settlement," said Paul Marciano, the 
family spokesman and the force behind Guess' riveting ad campaigns. "My opinion 
is that he wanted the verdict badly, and didn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman calmly denied the accusation, insisting that he had worked for five 
years to settle the dispute -- a battle waged not only in courts in Los 
Angeles, New York, Delaware and Hong Kong, but in criminal grand juries and the 
committee rooms of congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no denying that it was two other lawyers, Richard M. Coleman and 
Pierce O'Donnell -- the latter fresh from winning columnist Art Buchwald's case 
against Paramount Pictures over the origins of "Coming to America" -- who 
struck a deal with Weitzman. Their pact returned control of Guess to the 
Marcianos and made a still-secret division of the $106 million in company 
profits that piled up during the legal warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Trial lawyers say it is not unheard of for one set of lawyers to pursue 
settlement on a client's behalf while others are pushing for victory at trial. 
But it is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"The lawyers involved are obviously among the most high-profile . . . people in 
town," said Los Angeles attorney Alan I. Rothenberg, president of the State Bar 
of California. "It's an incredible twist to end it." 
</P>
<P>
What happened? 
</P>
<P>
Stories differ. One lawyer familiar with the case said pressure from insurance 
companies -- which have raised objections to paying for the defense of the 
Nakashes and Marcianos -- pushed the two sides toward settlement. But Grossman, 
other attorneys said, was so intent on winning a jury verdict that he could not 
stand back and negotiate a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Marciano said Grossman wanted both the glory of a legal victory as well as 
an undisputed claim to the $10-million bonus. Marciano said that he offered 
Grossman a small bonus, but that Grossman declined it. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman, whose clients have included sports car maker John Z. DeLorean and 
former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, said simply that O'Donnell and 
Coleman "brought a different perspective to the table than Marshall did." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, meanwhile, pointed cryptically to differences between the four 
Marciano brothers to explain the new lawyers. O'Donnell and Paul Marciano 
denied that the brothers had been at odds; Coleman could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman declined to discuss his fee arrangements, the $10-million bonus, or 
the filing of a lien against the Marcianos. Instead, he claimed "a very 
substantial victory," one nothing short of "a miracle," in regaining control of 
Guess for the Marcianos seven years after they sold a half-interest to the 
Nakashes -- a half-interest sold for $4.8 million that now is worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars.

NEW COLOMBIAN LEADER WANTS U.S. TRADE HELP;

<P>
President-elect Cesar Gaviria is asking the United States for a more 
cooperative policy toward Colombian exports as a way of supporting this 
country's costly fight against cocaine traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, a member of the governing Liberal Party, was elected Sunday and will 
take office Aug. 7. In a victory speech, he said his government will need more 
than "rhetorical support" from cocaine-consuming countries against violent 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only should discrimination against our export products end, but we should 
be given clear trade support to meet, in part, the tremendous economic cost 
that we are incurring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the eve of the elections, Gaviria said there is "uneasiness 
in Colombia" over U.S. trade discrimination, and he complained about the 
American role in last July's collapse of the International Coffee Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of dismay over how the United States was the main one 
responsible last year for the end of the coffee agreement, something that has 
done a lot of harm to Colombia," he said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
The pact set prices to be paid by consuming countries and export quotas for 
producing countries. The United States wanted changes in quotas that would 
allow it to buy more high-grade coffee from Colombia and Central America, but 
Brazil and other producers of lower-grade coffee balked. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also objected that producing countries in the agreement were 
selling coffee to consuming countries outside the agreement at lower prices 
than those paid by countries in the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the agreement stalled in London last July. The agreement 
collapsed, and world prices for unroasted Colombian coffee plunged from about 
$1.40 a pound to as little as 76 cents within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian officials calculate that the country lost more than $100 million last 
year because of the collapse and will lose at least $200 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia is the world's No. 2 coffee exporter, after Brazil. Coffee is the 
biggest legal Colombian export-earner, bringing in more than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush pledged last fall that the United States will do everything 
possible to reach a new coffee agreement as a special concession to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria has also complained of U.S. import duties on Colombian flowers, 
reflecting flower growers' complaints. But a U.S. official in Colombia said 
this week that a ruling in early May by the U.S. International Trade Commission 
lowers the average tariff paid on Colombian flowers from 4 cents a flower to 
less than one cent. 
</P>
<P>
Large flower growers whose production costs are inspected individually by U.S. 
officials generally pay low duties, but many small producers are charged higher 
tariffs under anti-dumping regulations. The U.S. official said their complaints 
are echoed by Gaviria and the current Colombian administration. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints are expected to be among trade concerns voiced by President 
Virgilio Barco Vargas in a meeting scheduled next Tuesday with President Bush 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia earns more than $200 million a year from flower exports, and the 
United States buys about 80%. About 60,000 Colombian families are said to make 
their living from the flower industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has agreed to help Colombia export other products such 
as textiles, clothing and exotic fruits to the United States. One U.S. plan 
would give Colombia a big annual quota for textiles and clothing that would 
allow years of production growth. 
</P>
<P>
But the American official here said Colombians want a blanket U.S. promise that 
there will be no restrictions on their exports. "We're not going to give that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade growth is a cornerstone of Gaviria's economic plan. He has 
proposed gradual reductions in Colombian import barriers as part of a plan to 
"internationalize" the economy.

Court Rules Against Caller I.D.: Bell of Pennsylvania's caller-identification 
service is an invasion of privacy and violates the state's wiretap law, a state 
court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The decision reverses an order by the state Public Utility Commission allowing 
Bell to offer the service. The service would let people to know who is calling 
before they pick up the phone, even if the caller's number is unlisted. Several

FOUNDER OF J. M. PETERS CO. EXTENDS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently moving to protect his interest in the company he founded, sold and 
is now trying to buy back, developer James M. Peters has signed a one-year 
extension of his employment agreement with J. M. Peters Co., officials of the 
large Southland residential development firm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The company said Peters' new agreement calls for him to remain as chairman and 
chief executive through Feb. 28, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the pact are "substantially the same terms as the agreement it 
replaces," the announcement said, "except that Mr. Peters could earn a larger 
bonus, depending on the company's fiscal year results." 
</P>
<P>
Peters' bonus for the fiscal year ended Feb. 28 totaled nearly $1 million, in 
addition to a base salary of $414,000. 
</P>
<P>
Peters was not available for comment Wednesday, and a company spokesman 
declined to discuss the terms of the new employment agreement or the status of 
Peters' negotiations to buy back the 87% of the company owned by San Jacinto 
Savings in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
But the company said in March that Peters has informed officials at San Jacinto 
that he is interested in acquiring the S&amp;L's stake in J. M. Peters Co. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said then that the beleaguered thrift, which recently reported 
that it was insolvent, was asking $14 a share but would settle for $12 a share 
-- or $144 million -- for its 12 million shares of the Peters company. Peters 
reportedly was offering $10 a share, or $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, 54, sold the company to San Jacinto Savings in 1985 for about $40 
million. In 1987, San Jacinto raised $10.5 million by selling 13% of the 
company in a public stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
Peters had been under contract to remain as J. M. Peters chairman and chief 
executive until early 1992 but had the option to unilaterally cancel the 
agreement this year. 
</P>
<P>
He exercised that option, but instead of walking away from the company he 
founded in 1975, Peters entered into negotiations to buy it. At the same time, 
he opened up talks on a new, short-term employment pact. 
</P>
<P>
Although J. M. Peters Co. is a profitable builder, specializing in luxury homes 
priced in the $300,000 to $500,000 range, San Jacinto has been trying to sell 
it for several years as part of a plan to rid itself of all but its core 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The company is so closely linked with Peters, said Barbara Allen, of Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co., that his presence increases its value to any potential 
purchaser. Because Peters has options to buy 600,000 shares at $6 per share, he 
would stand to make $3.6 million if someone bought the company at $12 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
And if Peters is serious about reacquiring the firm, she said, it would make 
little sense for him to walk away and continue negotiating as an outsider while 
someone else runs the operation.

PEOPLE: BORDEN POSITIONS D'AMATO FOR TOP JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony D'Amato has been elected president and chief operating officer of 
Borden Inc. in a move that positions him to succeed Borden Chairman R. J. 
Ventres when Ventres retires next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. D'Amato's promotion is an important step in preparation for an orderly 
succession," Ventres said. 
</P>
<P>
"The news signals who the next head of Borden will be," said John McMillan, 
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato, 59, is a 31-year Borden veteran who came from the company's chemical 
operations. He led the evolution of that business into its current packaging 
and industrial products division. His promotion is effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Saggese, senior group vice president of Borden's packaging and 
industrial products division, was named to succeed D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
In promoting an executive from the company's chemical group, Borden's board 
followed precedent. Ventres and his predecessor, Eugene Sullivan, came from the 
non-food side of Borden, which in 1989 accounted for 27.2% of its $7.6 billion 
in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The D'Amato appointment means that Borden is in capable hands and won't change 
that much," McMillan said. He said the promotion, well before Ventres' 
November, 1991, retirement, "gives D'Amato a chance to get his feet wet in the 
food business because he comes from the chemical business." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, D'Amato said he hoped in the next year and a half to 
implement Borden's plans to cut costs by restructuring its dairy division and 
updating its plants and equipment worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The vision and strategy have been set," D'Amato said. "I hope to be the key 
factor in implementing it." 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato said Borden would maintain its "pretty aggressive" stance in Europe, 
especially in plastics and packaging. "We intend to continue to be aggressive 
in Europe."

Bicoastal Corp., reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, 
said it will sell subsidiary Link-Miles Ltd. to Thomson-CSF for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Link-Miles Ltd., with headquarters in Lancing, England, develops military and 
commercial flight simulators. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson-CSF is a unit of the Paris-based conglomerate Thomson SA. 
</P>
<P>
The deal must still be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Tampa and by the 
British and French governments, said Janet H. Rogan, a spokeswoman for 
Bicoastal. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending is the sale of Simuflite, a pilot training facility in Dallas, 
said Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction will not affect Link-Miles Corp. of Binghampton, N.Y., which 
also manufactures flight simulators. 
</P>
<P>
Bicoastal, formerly Singer Co., filed for protection from creditors in 
November, 1989. Paul A. Bilzerian acquired Singer in February, 1988, for $1.06 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian, who headed the company until shortly before the Chapter 11 filing, 
was convicted in May, 1989, of concealing stock purchases in several 
unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts.

LOCAL PLANETARIUMS PUT THE STARS ALMOST WITHIN REACH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Planetariums offer Southern Californians the opportunity to explore the moon, 
the sun, the stars and other celestial landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
"The planetarium is like a zoo, showing you things that don't exist in your 
neighborhood any longer," said John Mosley, program supervisor at Griffith 
Observatory in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A planetarium, he said, lets whoever is operating it "manipulate" the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"From your own back yard, it's pretty static. But in a planetarium, we can 
accelerate time, we can watch the motions of a planet through months and see 
eclipses happen," Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
Regularly scheduled public programs and special shows are offered at the 
following Southland planetariums: 
</P>
<P>
* Griffith Observatory, Planetarium and Hall of Science in Los Angeles: The 
large telescope on the roof is open for free viewing on clear nights (except 
Mondays) from dark until 9:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Science, which features exhibits on astronomy and the physical 
sciences, opens at 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays and 12:30 p.m. Saturdays and 
Sundays and closes at 10 p.m. Closed Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to planetarium shows is $3 for adults, $2 for seniors 65 and older, 
$1.50 for ages 5-12. Children under 5 are admitted only to special 1:30 p.m. 
shows. Laserium shows require separate admission. Call (818) 997-3624.

STORYTELLER USES MYTHS TO HELP BALANCE LIFE OF MODERN WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"In Search of the Wise Woman," a daylong outdoor workshop designed to explore 
the spirituality of women, will be held from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. June 10 at 
Topanga State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop will include storytelling, guided walks, discussions of feminine 
spirituality, exercises in dance and movement, and a concluding ritual, said 
Kathleen Zundell, who has been conducting the workshop for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I want women to be in touch with the Earth, their spirits and all that is," 
said Zundell. "We're at a desperate point; we must restore the balance of the 
feminine in our lives. As we work to restore ourselves as women, we will heal 
the planet." 
</P>
<P>
A woman of wisdom, she said, "is a woman who listens carefully to herself and 
the voice of the goddess that comes from within . . . When we stay in touch 
with that voice, I think we give birth to the divine." 
</P>
<P>
Zundell's view of the world is not touchy-feely or New Age. First and foremost, 
she is a teacher, a creative movement specialist and a storyteller. "To educate 
means to draw forth," she said. "As a teacher, I must create an environment 
where wisdom comes from the participants. I must pose questions, tell some 
stories that evoke feelings, and allow them to share their answers and 
feelings. My work as a leader is to be as clear as I possibly can be with my 
own truth." 
</P>
<P>
The workshops are held in the oak woodlands and grasslands of the park because, 
she said, it's important that women gather together in places other than the 
office, the kitchen, the health club or the mall. "In the state park, we can 
connect consciously and unconsciously with the Earth Mother. We can get back in 
touch with the beauty of the Earth and open spaces." 
</P>
<P>
In her storytelling sessions, Zundell calls on ancient goddess myths to help 
reveal universal truths. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the myths as great jewels hidden in treasure chests. There is great 
wisdom and truth when we find those stories that can teach and heal us," she 
said. "The myths can help us examine our lives and relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the myth of Demeter and Persephone has captured Zundell's attention, 
and forms the basis for part of the workshop. For those who have forgotten 
Mythology 101, the myth, briefly interpreted, is the story of Demeter, the 
goddess of grain, and her maiden daughter, Persephone, who is abducted into the 
underworld by Hades. The grief-stricken Demeter searches in vain for her 
daughter and refuses to allow anything to grow on Earth until the girl is 
returned. With the help of Hecate, the old crone, Persephone is allowed to come 
back, and Demeter restores fertility to the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
This myth, according to Zundell, offers a number of powerful images that are 
meaningful to women. Demeter represents the mother archetype, Persephone is the 
eternal girl, and Hecate the mysterious, wise woman. 
</P>
<P>
"This myth is about the triple aspect of the goddess," she said. "It's about 
the cyclic aspect of nature and -- always -- rebirth. The child, mother and 
crone; birth, life and death; the created, the creator and the destroyer." 
</P>
<P>
One of the exercises in Zundell's workshop is an examination of ancient goddess 
images. She has compiled a notebook of photographs, postcards and sketches of 
ancient stone carvings, marble statues and other art objects, all of which 
depict various aspects of divine womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
The archetypal images Zundell shows are profoundly different from the images 
that bombard modern women, images that reduce femininity to a commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Flipping through the pages of her notebook, Zundell points to a rounded 
figurine from ancient Sparta. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that -- isn't she centered, strong and powerful? This woman knows who 
she is. Put that in front of your face every day. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to an Egyptian stone carving of a woman with breasts exposed and arms 
raised triumphantly, Zundell said: "Think this woman had implants? Was she 
afraid of how big or little she was?" 
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, Zundell said, feminine power was not only valued, it was 
honored and defined as divine. "These rich, beautiful images that we're sharing 
feed the deep subconscious mind in a way that no advertising can. It is 
empowering to look at them." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, many women are looking for -- and finding -- the goddess within. 
Each time the Wilderness Institute offers one of Zundell's "In Search of the 
Wise Woman" workshops, it's fully booked. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a definite interest in programs just for women," said Institute 
spokesperson Chris Imhoff. "This is an outdoors-oriented program that focuses 
on the cultural and historical roles of women. We've had a great response." 
</P>
<P>
Zundell thinks the problems and issues of today's world call for women to 
gather in nature. "We talk to each other and we create energy," she said. "When 
we stand in our own light, we also light the way for other women and men." 
</P>
<P>

Zundell, Wilderness Institute, 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. June 10. For more 
information, call the Institute, (818) 991-7327.

SOURCES OF FIBER

Question: I've been told that if a person tends to be constipated, it would be 
a good idea to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
I've also been told that fiber can be found in fruits and vegetables as well as 
in cereals. My question is: Which foods would it be better to have to prevent 
constipation? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: In general, cereal grains are more effective in alleviating 
constipation than are fruits and vegetables. If you increase the amount of 
fiber in your diet, you should be certain to maintain an adequate intake of 
liquids, since fiber absorbs water in the intestine.

VIETNAM: Among those gratified by the Vietnam memorial at Huntington Beach High 
School (B1) is B.T. Collins, chief deputy state treasurer who lost an arm and a 
leg in Vietnam. . . . As a fund-raiser for the privately endowed California War 
Memorial in Sacramento, Collins found Orange County to be tight-fisted, despite 
its hawkish, patriotic image. One local veterans group even urged members not 
to contribute, Collins said. Bill Billiter and Jan Herman

GIRTH CONTROL: Just what is Orange County's leading gourmand, Tommy Lasorda of 
Fullerton, trying to tell us? . . . Last year he dropped 40 pounds and went on 
TV to endorse a weight-reducing milkshake. But this year, his food company in 
Irvine is going national to tout his pasta sauce from Maine to Malibu (D7). . . 
. No conflict, says a Lasorda spokesman. Tommy has the milkshake for breakfast 
and lunch and pasta for dinner. Bill Billiter and Jan Herman

HYPER: About 80% of hyperactive children are boys, and "first-born males have 
the highest rate of the disorder," says Dr. Paul Hoernig of Newport Harbor 
Hospital. Some of those with what is now called attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, or ADHD, will grow out of it, but there is no way to determine who 
will, Hoernig said. . . . Newport Harbor is working with UC Irvine in an 
unusual program for hyperactive kids that links special schooling with medical 
treatment that many of them need (N1). Bill Billiter and Jan Herman

SPRAY-WEARY RESIDENTS HAIL MEDFLY TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carwash manager Eriberto Arellano expects two dozen vehicles outside his 
Westminster business this morning, double the normal number. He'll have an 
extra five or six workers on hand to keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
So goes "the morning after" in Malathion Country. 
</P>
<P>
As helicopters swooped down Wednesday night over Garden Grove in the final 
Mediterranean fruit fly spraying scheduled for Orange and Los Angeles counties, 
Arellano, other car washers and tarpaulin salespeople were about the only ones 
willing to admit that they may miss the Medfly war. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Klein won't. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-malathion activist, Klein pictures an end to "a really bad episode of 
'The Twilight Zone,' with all of us in it." Fellow activist Adelaide Nimitz of 
Burbank called this "Armistice Day." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of several recent false finales, however, malathion critics are wary of 
any assurances from state agriculture officials. Spraying will continue in 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties through the summer. And an application in 
Compton next month will target the Mexican fruit fly. But officials promise 
that, barring any fly trappings, Wednesday night's spraying over a 
36-square-mile area with Garden Grove at its center will be the last aerial 
Medfly assault for the Los Angeles Basin after 11 months of spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is the end," Klein said, "but it seems like we've heard all the 
lines before." 
</P>
<P>
On the evening news and in city halls, the emotional debate over the spraying 
has been largely over still-unresolved issues: long-term health effects and 
agricultural vitality, constitutional liberties and governmental emergency 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
But for many of the 4 million Southland spray-zone survivors, it was the 
smaller, week-to-week miseries that will make the Medfly campaign an unpleasant 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Babies cry, awakened by helicopters. Headaches, sniffles and other health 
problems are blamed on malathion. Car coverings and tarps are dragged out on 
spray nights. Restaurants and bars sit empty during applications. Teachers 
report high absentee rates on the mornings after. 
</P>
<P>
Even some state officials are glad it's over. 
</P>
<P>
Said Department of Food and Agriculture spokeswoman Gera Curry, who has spent 
months fielding skeptical and sometimes angry questions: "It's a nuisance, and 
we're aware of that and we regret it and we apologize for it. 
</P>
<P>
"But the truth is, we are just as tired of this as everyone else. You think I 
won't love it when this ends and I can go home and get back to a normal life? 
I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother -- do you think I enjoy being called a baby 
killer?" 
</P>
<P>
The spray-day routine in Mollie Haines' middle-class Garden Grove home begins 
in late afternoon. By Wednesday night, it had become as regular as clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
Cover the back-yard pool, play equipment and cars with plastic. Get two young 
sons in bed by 8:30 before the helicopters come -- although they will no doubt 
wake up anyway from the noise, scared that the choppers may "fall on us." Bring 
the dog in. Take a few dozen calls during the night from fellow activists, 
residents and reporters, several hundred of whom have turned out in past months 
for anti-malathion protests that she helped organize. Try to get some sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just so tired, so exasperated with this spraying," she said. 
"You've got to plan your activities based on when the next spraying is -- stay 
inside and cover your things and all that. You're under house arrest, like a 
prisoner or a bad child being punished." 
</P>
<P>
Horror stories about the sprayings have been the stuff of regular chatter at 
coffee shops and grocery stores in Medfly zones, but the stir has not 
translated into many financial claims against the state. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 spray campaign in Northern California brought 26,171 claims for 
financial damages to the state, prompting payouts of about $400,000 to 710 
successful litigants. By contrast, state officials report 32 Southern 
California claims at last count. Two have already been rejected, and the rest 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Donegan, All-State Insurance's area underwriting manager, said insurers 
aren't seeing many claims either. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people think that's because the spraying has been so well advertised that 
people here are just taking precautions with their cars and things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few area residents who left the area during spraying for fear of malathion 
exposure have tried billing the state for hotel, food and travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
One San Marino couple restoring the historic Blacker House have already gotten 
nearly $400 from the state to cover half the cost of wrapping plastic around 
their 1907-era copper gutters -- which they say were discolored by the 
pesticide-bait mix. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Michael Rust of Redondo Beach, who got stuck in a spraying while 
visiting a friend in Fullerton. Rust wrote in his state claim: "My entire paint 
job has white or gray specks or chips in it -- would not wash out and has 
pitted my car! This is terrible!" 
</P>
<P>
Rust isn't alone -- as in 1981, virtually all of the claims center on that 
decades-old Southern California obsession: the car. 
</P>
<P>
As manager at a Midwest car dealership years ago, George Lucas had to deal with 
the occasional storm that whipped its way through his lot and threatened havoc 
on his automobiles. Now, as general manager of a Downey dealership in the midst 
of a spray zone, he wishes he were that lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take a two-foot snowstorm, a blizzard, in a second over this stuff," he 
says. For more than four months, he had to put 15 of his employees on overtime 
for 2 a.m. post-spray washings of 800 cars at his Penske Cadillac and Honda 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
A few cars got blemished anyway, he says. Recently, he even had to buy back a 
damaged Cadillac from a disgruntled customer. Lucas figures he spent $40,000 on 
overtime pay and car refinishing because of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"I normally don't get this impassioned about an issue, but this whole thing has 
just been so frustrating," he said. "And it's easy to see why people are 
worried about their health; it's hard for me to believe that a product so 
harmless can do this to an automobile." 
</P>
<P>
Most spray-zone residents seem preoccupied with covering their automobiles and 
keeping themselves and their children inside -- even several days after 
sprayings -- but some veterinarians fear that it is the animals that have been 
most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Kislak, a Sherman Oaks veterinarian, says she has noticed recent reports 
of lethargy and illness in pets whose owners suspect malathion as the cause. 
And Kislak said she saw four recent cases of birth defects involving three 
birds and a squirrel in spray areas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her suspicions, the veterinarian admits that she has no medical 
evidence linking the health problems to spraying. State officials say that's 
because no evidence exists. But don't try telling that to Skip Chernov. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old thoroughbred had always been a healthy horse -- until malathion 
got her. At least that's the way owner Skip Chernov of Los Angeles figures it. 
How else to explain I'm Early's fever, cough, and red, watery eyes after a 
stall window was left open during a December spraying over the Santa Anita race 
track, the owner asks. 
</P>
<P>
Chernov doesn't have tests to pinpoint the cause of the illness, but he has no 
doubt that malathion is the culprit. "It was so immediate. She never had a sick 
day in her life, and bang -- she gets ill," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Chernov, 52, hopes that the horse will bounce back. In the meantime, he has 
taken no chances with his four other horses at Santa Anita. After each 
spraying, he worried about getting new bedding for them, changing their water 
and hosing down their stalls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hassle," he says. "But you're powerless." 
</P>
<P>
If the Medfly campaign has marked a horrific nuisance for local residents and 
animals, homeless advocates charge it has been nothing short of 
life-threatening for those people without a roof to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding their frustration is the state's position, upheld in court, that it 
has no obligation to provide shelters for thousands of homeless people in spray 
zones. That has left the job to municipalities, such as the city of Los 
Angeles, and private groups, such as the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, to 
open shelters during sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened to these people," said homeless advocate Linda Dunlap of 
Garden Grove, "is one of the biggest degradations of human life I've ever seen. 
We're told to bring our pets and furniture inside, and the state lets people -- 
human beings -- stay outside, just ignoring them." 
</P>
<P>
It was the thumping of choppers overhead in Anaheim that first roused the young 
man with the scraggly beard from his light sleep. More military operations, 
John Anderson figured as he buried himself in a blanket that was his only 
protection from the crisp January air. Then came the mist -- a thick, sticky 
mist that was tougher to ignore than the choppers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what the heck it was," recalls Anderson, a 32-year-old San Pedro 
native who has lived on the streets for the last six years and in an Anaheim 
field next to the Santa Ana Freeway for the last two. He had barely heard of a 
Medfly -- then. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson thinks the first spraying made him sick for a few weeks; he would have 
been bedridden -- if he owned a bed. Now, he has made it a point to track spray 
dates in the newspaper. Still, the part-Cherokee, who declares "I'm not leaving 
my land," stayed outside for the next application. "I wanted to test it, see if 
it made me sick again."

It didn't. But he was still unswayed. "I'm really against this spraying and

DEVELOPMENT FEE INCREASES APPROVED

<P>
Residents and businesses will now pay substantially more to meet property 
development requirements under a fee schedule approved by the City Council this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Planning fees are paid to the city whenever there is development or 
redevelopment that requires a zone change, a special permit or some other 
review by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The fees cover the administrative costs incurred by the city staff. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increases affect conditional use permits, which will go up from $200 to 
$400; variances, up from $100 to $400, and zoning ordinance amendments, up from 
$250 to $650. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if an environmental impact report is required, the developer must pay 
$500. The service was free in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Other planning fees, including appeals, site plan reviews, general plan 
amendments and tentative tract and parcel maps, were also increased. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Larry Emerson said that while the increases are significant -- in 
many cases doubling and in one case even quadrupling the old fees -- they are 
comparable to the actual costs and will bring Los Alamitos in line with what 
other cities in the county charge for such services. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is unreasonable at all to get these increases, to recover our 
costs," Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several months, the city has increased fees and fines for a 
variety of city services, including permit and annual monitoring fees for the 
city's alarm system and parking ticket fines. 
</P>
<P>
The council was told at its midyear budget review session in January that the 
city -- because of a declining sales tax base -- would have to look for other 
sources of revenue. KATHIE BOZANICH

AIRPORT PANEL ASKED TO OVERRIDE REPORT 
</P>

<P>
The City Council passed a resolution this week asking the Orange County Airport 
Land Use Commission to reject a study that establishes "accident zones" in 
cities near the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center airfield. 
</P>
<P>
The council also asked the commission to delay action on the item until the 
federal Department of Defense has an opportunity to make revisions to the plan. 
City Manager Darrell Essex said it was unclear whether the federal government 
had adopted a final version of the plan, as had been previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission decides to adopt the plan, "accident zones" would be created 
in several cities surrounding the airfield. The plan concludes that development 
should be severly restricted in these areas because of the potential for 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are angry that the study comes after development has gone 
unchecked around the airfield. Several hundred homes, businesses and a school 
have been built in the accident zones. 
</P>
<P>
Further, officials argue that the study is flawed because it doesn't take into 
account the types of aircraft that use the base. According to Army estimates, 
helicopters account for more than 90% of airfield traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant hired by the city to study the report said at least 5,000 large 
aircraft flights must be made each year before an airfield qualifies for the 
type of "accident zones" called for in the study. The Los Alamitos installation 
has fewer than 500 large aircraft flights each year, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
If the Airport Land Use Commission decides to adopt the report, the City 
Council will still be able to override recommendations of the study vote with a 
four-fifths majority vote. However, if the city decides to allow development in 
the zones and an accident occurs, the city assumes the liability. 
</P>
<P>
The adopted resolution will be sent to other cities that are affected by the 
study to solicit their support, Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
The Airport Land Use Commission is expected to review the plan July 19. LYNDA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;

<P>
MOLA CO. SUFFERS ANOTHER SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court commissioner on Wednesday rejected a request by the Mola 
Development Co. to reinstate approvals for its controversial $200-million 
residential project on the Old Hellman Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
Court Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer disagreed with Mola's argument that the 
approvals, which he invalidated because they were issued while the city's 
state-mandated housing plan was obsolete, should be reinstated now that the 
city has a new plan in place. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach was forced to update its housing plan, a strategy for dealing with 
future housing needs, after the Wetlands Restoration Society successfully sued 
the city for approving the development while the plan needed updating. 
</P>
<P>
Mola officials said earlier this month that the Hellman Co., which owns the 
land on which Mola hopes to build its 329-unit project, would discontinue 
Mola's option to buy the property if the company did not get development 
approvals by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mola had hoped to gain those approvals either from Bauer on Wednesday or from 
the City Council at their Tuesday meeting, but came away empty-handed on both 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
Mola officials did not return calls for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It now appears that approval for the project cannot come earlier than June 4, 
when the council next meets to discuss the development. 
</P>
<P>
Council members indicated Tuesday that they expect to meet June 11 to further 
discuss the project. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, city officials hope to have a new assessment of the geological 
hazards on the Hellman property, which includes two earthquake faults. The 
study was requested by newly elected Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe, who said she 
could not approve the project until safety concerns are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The council is also under pressure to either approve or reject Mola's tentative 
tract map by June 13 because of a state law that says a council must decide on 
maps for a project no later than one month after the first council meeting 
following Planning Commission approval of the maps. 
</P>
<P>
And there may be more delays next week, when the wetlands society plans to file 
a legal challenge to the new city housing plan, said attorney Jonathan 
Lehrer-Graiwer. The group, which is fighting to keep the land open for wetlands 
restoration, contends that the city's new housing plan, adopted May 10, shows 
no commitment to provide low-cost housing in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a number of defects," Lehrer-Graiwer. 
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Lehrer-Graiwer will ask Bauer to do something no judge in Orange 
County has done: etermine whether the housing plan is a good faith effort. But 
according to City Manager Robert Nelson, it's unlikely the judge will rule in 
the society's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"What basis does the judge have to make that ruling?" Nelson said. "This is not 
a matter of law. It's a matter of opinion." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

BREA-OLINDA, LAGUNA SAT DATA REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Following a countywide trend, high school seniors in the Brea-Olinda and Laguna 
Beach Unified school districts who graduated in 1989 scored significantly 
higher than their 1984 counterparts on the statewide Scholastic Aptitude Test, 
according to figures released this week by the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The reports on trends in test performance for college-bound seniors in the two 
districts were not included in a countywide report, published in Tuesday's 
editions of The Times and other media, because the state originally released 
figures only for the county's larger school districts, said state Department of 
Education spokeswoman Susie Lange. 
</P>
<P>
In Brea-Olinda, statistics comparing 1984 graduates to members of the class of 
1989 showed that the number of seniors who scored 450 or better in the SAT's 
verbal section increased 76%, from 14.1% of seniors to 24.8%. In the math 
section, 30.5% of the seniors scored 500 or better in 1989, a 55% increase over 
the 19.7% figure for 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach, 35.5% of the 1989 seniors scored at least 450 in verbal, a 27% 
increase over 1984, and 34% of the 1989 seniors scored at least 500 in math, a 
39% jump. A verbal score of 450 and a math score of 500 makes most students 
eligible for admission to the University of California and California State 
University systems, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
The state report also showed that 45.2% of the Brea-Olinda class of 1989 met 
what are known as the "a-f requirements," or courses required by UC for 
admission. That represented a 21% rise over the 37.3% of graduates who met the 
requirements in 1985. In addition, 43.7 of every 100 1989 Brea-Olinda graduates 
passed advanced placement exams, a 217% rise over the 13.8 of every 100 who 
passed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Similar figures in Laguna Beach showed a 14% drop between 1985 and 1989 in 
seniors who met the a-f requirements, and 291% rise in the number of advanced 
placement exams passed per 100 seniors between 1984 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 14% decrease in the a-f requirements category in Laguna Beach and the 76% 
rise in seniors scoring at least 450 in the SAT verbal section in Brea-Olinda 
represented the lowest and highest performance rates in those categories in the 
county. However, state education officials noted that the Laguna Beach figures 
are for the district's only high school and that the Brea-Olinda statistics 
represent results for two high schools and thus cannot be directly compared to 
districts with greater numbers of students. TONY MARCANO

MISSION VIEJO MALL OFF-RAMP IS CLOSED

The northbound Crown Valley Parkway off-ramp on Interstate 5 will be closed 
indefinitely while geologists study a nearby hillside that appears to be 
slipping toward the ramp, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, geologists of the California Department of Transportation have 
noticed the hillside near the Mission Viejo Mall is approaching the off-ramp, 
said Gloria Carrillo, a Caltrans spokeswoman. After Monday's rains, mud oozed 
across the off-ramp and demolished two light poles and a signpost, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ramp will be closed until further notice," Carrillo said.

<P>
CLUB A RESPITE FOR YOUNG CAMBODIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sun was beginning to set along the shore of Newport Beach, but 10-year-old 
Sophin Pruong wasn't yet ready to call it a day. 
</P>
<P>
The feisty fifth-grader from Santa Ana was determined to finish the 
mini-swimming pool she had begun to dig about 10 feet from the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the beach," she said, as she continued to dig vigorously. "Mostly, I 
like the sand." 
</P>
<P>
Sophin was one of eight members of the Cambodian Camp Fire Club roasting hot 
dogs, building castles and enjoying their trip to the beach Tuesday. The club 
gives the children, most of whom live on crime-plagued Minnie Street in Santa 
Ana, a respite from the neighborhood and exposes them to new experiences. 
</P>
<P>
The club was started last August as a way of introducing the Camp Fire 
organization to the Cambodian community and came about through a program at 
Cambodian Family Inc., a nonprofit center in Santa Ana set up by Cambodian 
refugees as a support network. The center provides a room for the club's weekly 
meetings and helps pay for camping trips and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"These children live in a neighborhood with crime, prostitution and gang 
activity," said Irene Minton, program director at Cambodian Family. "The 
children don't have structure in their lives, and their parents don't know how 
to build up positive resistance." 
</P>
<P>
While the girls, who range in age from 7 to 12, meet weekly to play and to 
learn self-reliance, they especially enjoy the outdoor trips, organizers say. 
Last month, troop leader Colleen Hinker took the group to O'Neill Regional Park 
for a weekend camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time any of them had been camping," she said. "They had a 
great time. We spotted a rattlesnake on the trip, which I don't think any of 
them will ever forget." 
</P>
<P>
Camp Fire Executive Director Carol Geisbauer said she hopes this pilot program, 
which will continue next year, will encourage more Cambodian children and their 
parents to get involved in Camp Fire, which became co-ed in the mid-1970s. 
There are 7,500 members in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional youth service organizations have not been too successful in 
reaching the minority community or the recent refugee community because the 
traditional youth club is not part of their culture," Geisbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the girls in the Cambodian Camp Fire Club have blended well with 
Hinker's other troops, and even performed the traditional Cambodian flower 
dance at Camp Fire's 80th birthday celebration in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Cambodians," said Hinker, who 
befriended several Cambodians in the 1960s while attending Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept in touch for many years by letter but the letters stopped coming in 
the middle of the Vietnam War," Hinker said. "I believe that they are probably 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
And so, the Cambodian Camp Fire Club is Hinker's way of paying tribute to her 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is so important because it exposes the kids to a lot of 
experiences that they wouldn't have otherwise," said Hinker, who has been a 
troop leader for 10 years. "It enlarges their world a little." GREG HERNANDEZ

PULIDO ACCUSED OF 'EMPTY PROMISES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 80 people crowded onto Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr.'s front lawn 
Wednesday night to protest what they call his "empty promises" concerning a 
major redevelopment project. Pulido was not home during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a lot of commitments in public, but in private, he shows a different 
face," said Nativo Lopez, who organized the demonstration and is director of 
the Latino group Hermandad Mexicana Nacional. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, members of Hermandad and the Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., 
objected to Pulido's actions concerning the $335-million Bristol Street 
Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said Pulido has not moved to protect 1,000 homes and businesses from 
possible demolition to make room for the city's latest development project. 
</P>
<P>
"Pulido told us he would do all he can to save the properties," said Lopez. 
"Now he is backpedaling." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is still debating what to do about the houses and businesses 
that lie within the project area. The project includes a 3.5-mile stretch of 
Bristol Street from Central Avenue to 17th Street. It also affects portions of 
1st Street and 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment staff is recommending that the city include the 
properties in the project area. Hermandad, the primary opponent of the 
redevelopment project, maintains that the city can save 1,453 parcels and 
should be more considerate of the hundreds of people who may lose their homes 
if the buildings are included. In January, Hermandad sued the city in an effort 
to halt the project. The suit is now pending. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Pulido said the project affected too many properties. "I 
think it's too broad as it stands," Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said he has complained that the redevelopment staff had not contacted 
affected property owners and had not prepared a report detailing which 
addresses will actually be affected by the project. 
</P>
<P>
"He told all of these people what he would do but he never did what he said he 
would," said Olga Castor, who said she worked on Pulido's council campaign. "He 
made promises he hasn't delivered." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez also used the occasion to take issue with Pulido's place of residence. He 
charged that the councilman does not actually live in Santa Ana but in 
Fullerton. Pulido, whose address is listed on West Harvard Street in Santa Ana 
in county registrar of voters records, was not available for comment on the 
allegation about his place of residence. LILY ENG and GREG HERNANDEZ

TUSTIN COLOR GUARD ORDERS RESTAURANT TO HOLD THE PINK

First came the flap over the purple wall at the Tustin Market Place. Now, city 
officials say, the pink awning on Fat Freddy's has to go. 
</P>
<P>
They have ordered the owners of Fat Freddy's 50's Diner on El Camino Real to 
tear down its dark pink awning and replace it with a turquoise one. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say turquoise -- the color the awning used to be -- is more 
compatible with the building and surrounding properties. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's owners said they changed awning colors about a year ago but 
didn't ask for permission because they didn't know they were supposed to, said 
co-owner Chris Lagaris. The old turquoise awning, he said, was dirty, ripped 
and covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to clean it up," he said. "We were totally unaware we had to ask 
permission from the city to change the color. . . . The rose color was a '50 
color -- you know, pink Cadillacs and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
The commission first got wind of the offending awning last August when it 
considered a request for a neon sign at Fat Freddy's. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been going back and forth with them over the awning for eight months," 
said Christine Shingleton, director of the city's Community Development 
Department. "The commission told them in August that they had to take care of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The last flap over decorator colors started about a year and a half ago when 
residents and city officials in Tustin and Irvine complained about a bright 
purple wall at Tustin Market Place. In response, the Irvine Co. repainted the 
eight-foot wall deep brick red but later worked out a compromise with the city 
and painted it a more subdued purple. 
</P>
<P>
As a "significant architectural element," Fat Freddy's awning is subject to 
review by the Tustin Community Development Department and must fit with the 
surrounding area, according to city code. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really care what color it was," Commissioner Ed Shaheen said, "but I 
went along with what staff wanted and the rest of the commission wanted. Then I 
suggested red, white and blue. Most of the commission wanted turquoise, the 
original color. I'm not one for all those fancy colors." 
</P>
<P>
Lagaris, whose diner sports black and white checked trim, turquoise window 
frames and a black tile roof, said he doesn't understand why turquoise is 
acceptable and rose, the color the manufacturer calls the awning, is not. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both the same type of color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owner Steve Xenos said they do not want to get involved in a dispute with 
the city, though, and will tear down the awning in the next two or three 
months. He said the new awning will cost $6,000.

GOVERNOR BACKS MEASURES TO AID CRIME VICTIMS

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, pledging his support for two crime measures scheduled 
to go before the voters this year, stressed Wednesday that crime victims need 
to be given as much attention as criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"When one hears the cries of sorrow of these innocent people, plus the cries of 
those others who have suffered at the hands of criminals, it is hard to imagine 
any group of people more deserving of our attention," Deukmejian said at the 
Governor's Conference on Victims' Services and Public Safety at the Anaheim 
Hilton and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
The governor told a group of 2,000 law enforcement officers, volunteers and 
people who work with crime victims that passing the Crime Victims Justice 
Reform Act would be one step toward addressing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The act, which will appear as Proposition 115 on Tuesday's ballot, proposes 
increasing the jail penalties for crimes such as torture and murder and 
speeding up the criminal trial process. 
</P>
<P>
"The mindless prolongation of judicial proceedings destroys the integrity of 
our criminal justice system and destroys the lives of victims and their 
families," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
The other initiative, called the Prison Inmate Initiative of 1990, would give 
the state the authority to make convicted criminals work to help offset what it 
costs to keep them in prison. The initiative, scheduled to appear on the 
November ballot, would also allow a portion of the wages earned by inmates to 
be set aside as compensation to their victims. 
</P>
<P>
Following his speech, Deukmejian presented 30 people with the 1990 Governor's 
Victim Services and Public Safety Awards. The awards recognize individuals and 
programs that have made significant contributions in the areas of victim 
services and public safety. Recipients were chosen from more than 200 
nominations submitted by community-based organizations, law enforcement 
agencies and victim services providers. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the state has sponsored an annual program recognizing providers of 
victim services.

<P>
It's unusual, to say the least: Two campaigns are being quietly waged with 
virtually no accusations or political arguments, hardly any fund raising or 
campaign literature and only a few speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, these races will put two new judges on the bench in Orange County for 
six-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the ever-so-polite world of judicial campaigning, where the 
candidates are so full of praise for one another that they hardly seem like 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The races are permeated by an unspoken code that makes super-aggressive 
campaigning too, well, unseemly. And for the three candidates who are sitting 
judges, that feeling is enhanced by very real rules: the canons of judicial 
ethics forbid them from soliciting money themselves. 
</P>
<P>
All this has combined to produce two races that are so low-key as to be nearly 
invisible. 
</P>
<P>
There are two vacancies, and three candidates vying for each one. The spots 
were created by the retirement of Superior Court Judge Frank Domenichini and 
Westminster Municipal Judge William L. Mock. Since it might be tough for any 
one contender in a three-way race to garner more than 50% of the vote, a 
November runoff election is viewed as likely. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five other Superior and Municipal Court judges came up for reelection 
this year, but none was challenged. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for Domenichini's Superior Court seat, the candidates are: Robert 
E. Thomas, Glenn Mahler and Daniel Charles Dutcher. 
</P>
<P>
Dutcher, 59, of Santa Ana, a Municipal Court judge in Westminster, has run the 
ultimate low-profile campaign: He has sought no endorsements, solicited no 
contributions and made only one speech. Dutcher says he believes that seeking 
support from special interest groups would compromise his judicial impartiality 
and independence. 
</P>
<P>
Dutcher, who was elected to the bench in 1982 after winning a much-publicized 
court battle challenging his opponent's residency, considers himself "middle of 
the road" in his approach to the law and says he prides himself on treating 
those before him in a "humane" manner. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler, 42, of Irvine, a Municipal Court judge in Newport Beach, has relied on 
friends and colleagues to spread the word about his reputation after 13 years 
on the bench as a traffic referee, commissioner and judge. Mahler says he wants 
voters to know that he is a hard worker who is usually the first judge in the 
courthouse in the morning and the last one out at night. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler also has refused all campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler is concerned that the much-touted "fast-track" program of expediting 
civil cases in Superior Court has imposed longer delays on the civil cases that 
are not part of that program. Some of the burden could be eased by doubling the 
Municipal Court's limit of $25,000 in damages to allow more cases to be filed 
there, Mahler said. Another courthouse and more judges are also required, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 48, of Newport Beach, has been a Municipal Court judge in Santa Ana for 
9 1/2 years. A proponent of the death penalty, Thomas depicts himself as tough 
on crime. He says he is dedicated to protecting neighborhoods from criminals 
and pledges to deal sternly with drunk drivers, drug dealers, "gang thugs" and 
hard-core criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' stance has garnered endorsements from many law enforcement groups, 
including the Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, Deputy District Attorneys and 
Deputy Marshals associations and the police chiefs of Santa Ana and Laguna 
Beach, in addition to dozens of Orange County judges and the California 
Republican Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
In Thomas' view, the Superior Court's biggest problem is the delays it poses to 
litigants. He hopes that the court will keep up its aggressive stand on trying 
new programs to expedite trials, such as transferring bulky paper case files 
into the computer system so they can be quickly circulated around the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for Mock's Municipal Court seat, the candidates are: Donald S. 
Macintyre, Ross I. Gallen and Ralph Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Gallen, 49, an attorney, has launched perhaps the most vigorous judicial 
campaign of the election. The Irvine resident walks precincts, pressing 
literature into people's hands. He appears in a commercial on local cable TV. 
He bills himself as a law-and-order candidate who will be tough on criminals 
and has won the endorsement of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Gallen says he believes that Municipal Court is a place where young 
offenders can still be turned around. If elected, Gallen hopes to tailor 
sentences to enhance a defendant's chance of rehabilitation, whether through a 
stiff jail term or a community service project. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, 57, also an attorney, says he, too, believes in the rehabilitative 
value of work for those convicted of crimes. He would like to see a stronger 
judicial crackdown on crimes involving alcohol, such as drunk driving, and he 
says he believes that sentencing offenders to pick up trash or rake leaves 
makes a greater impact on them than simply imposing fines. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, a Costa Mesa resident, also believes that the courts must expand their 
hours to accommodate the growing caseload and the schedules of working people 
who are litigating cases. But he opposes building a new courthouse, saying that 
money could be better spent on health care for the poor or shelter for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Macintyre, 47, a commissioner in Municipal Court in Westminster, has taken 
several weeks of vacation time to walk precincts all over the county. In 
talking to voters, the San Clemente resident has capitalized on his extensive 
judicial experience, something his rivals cannot claim. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was elected to Justice Court in Lassen County in 1976, Macintyre has 
sat by assignment as a judge in 10 counties in California. A former prosecutor, 
Macintyre also paints himself as tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a track record which law enforcement endorses," he says. "You violate 
the law, you go to jail. That's what judges are supposed to do. Just look at 
the crime. That's why citizens are sitting in their houses with bars on the 
windows and big dogs."

LITIGATION: THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRM, SUED OVER HEART VALVE FAILURES, HAS LOBBIED 
TO RETAIN A SENTENCE IN A CIVIL PROCEDURE ALLOWING JUDGES TO DISMISS SUITS BY 
OUT-OF-STATE PLAINTIFFS.

<P>
After a fierce lobbying war, a legal loophole -- which could help an Orange 
County manufacturer of heart valves resist hundreds of product-liability claims 
-- will probably remain on the books. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, Irvine-based Shiley Inc., its parent, Pfizer Inc., and 
the California Manufacturers Assn. have mobilized a team of lobbyists and 
dozens of top company officials to block a bill that would delete an arcane 
sentence in civil procedure that allows California judges to dismiss lawsuits 
by out-of-state plaintiffs for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Now the bill's sponsor, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), says the intense 
lobbying campaign has him seriously thinking about dropping the bill. "It 
generated opposition from members, which in turn has an effect on the future of 
the bill," Kopp said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the legislative battle is the potential for large court judgments 
against Shiley, which is facing an onslaught of lawsuits over defects in some 
of its Bjork-Shiley heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that 395 of the 60-degree and 70-degree Convexo-Concave heart 
valves have failed, leading to an estimated 261 deaths. The company sold 86,000 
of the valves between 1979 and 1983, about half to foreign patients. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley has been accused in several liability lawsuits -- which ultimately 
represent hundreds of millions of dollars in potential damages -- of 
suppressing evidence that tiny wire struts in the device were prone to break 
and cause fatal hemorrhaging. The company denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The high-stakes issue spilled over into the Legislature in late March when Kopp 
amended one of his bills to delete an obscure, 24-word sentence that allows 
judges to dismiss lawsuits involving foreigners if an overseas trial is deemed 
more convenient. Kopp has argued that the provision was a "fluke" that should 
be stricken by the Legislature, even though the loophole is already scheduled 
to expire by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But Shiley took strong exception because it has used the sentence to fend off 
lawsuits filed by foreign customers. So far, it has gained one dismissal in 
December of an Orange County lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We freely acknowledge Shiley's interests in containing legal costs," company 
spokesman Robert J. Fauteux said of the firm's fight against Kopp. "But that is 
not the same thing as suggesting we are trying to avoid or evade legal 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Joined by the powerful 900-member manufacturers' group, Shiley and New 
York-based Pfizer have argued that the obscure sentence creates a "level 
playing field" in product-liability cases while holding down legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in California, the costs of litigation are generally conceded to be 
higher than anywhere else in the world," Fauteux said. "And that's when you are 
the winner. In the case of losing, the product-liability awards in California 
are not capped." 
</P>
<P>
Without the sentence, the lobbyists add, California attorneys would continue to 
file lawsuits and courts in the state would remain clogged. 
</P>
<P>
"To have the court clogged with a lot of foreign plaintiffs who are here 
primarily because they think they can get a bigger award is just not doing a 
service to California citizens," said Anne Kelley, lobbyist for the CMA. 
</P>
<P>
Yet those who supported Kopp's bill claim that Shiley and other corporations 
actually want to shirk their responsibility by staying out of California 
courtrooms, where there is no limit on product liability awards. 
</P>
<P>
"What Shiley has done is appear in the Orange County Superior Court in the 
foreign cases and said, 'This is an inconvenient place for us to litigate these 
cases,' " said Joseph Dunn, a Newport Beach attorney who is handling 280 suits 
against Shiley. "They say that despite the fact that their headquarters is a 
mere five miles from the courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
Added Harry M. Snyder, director of the Consumers Union's West Coast office: 
"Unless we send a clear message, we will continue to see exploding Ford Pintos, 
exploding heart valves and dangerous contraceptive devices all being kept on 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Consumers Union, the California Trial Laywers Assn. -- one 
of the state's top interest groups -- has been lobbying on behalf of the Kopp 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The CMA, another strong interest group, has spent money twisting arms on the 
Kopp measure and also has called on its corporate membership to inundate 
lawmakers with letters advocating retention of the loophole. Kopp said the 
effort, which resulted in 75 to 80 letters to his office alone, was 
"remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer itself is no stranger to state politics. Campaign reports show the 
pharmaceutical giant has contributed at least $74,800 to legislators over the 
last three years, as well as thousands of dollars in gifts and trips. 
</P>
<P>
One beneficiary, records show, was former Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights), who accepted tickets to a Broadway play, expensive meals and an 
overseas trip during the last two years from Pfizer. Campbell quit the Senate 
in December to become president of the CMA. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer also has pitched in by hiring two outside lobbyists to help kill the 
Kopp bill. One is Dennis Carpenter, former Orange County senator and now 
contract lobbyist for Orange County; the other is Jerome M. Haleva, who 
formerly served portions of Orange County as the top aide to Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the lobbying effort, Kopp said Wednesday that it was his 
"predilection" to drop the bill, but that he wouldn't make a final decision 
until Friday. Even if he backs off, Kopp said, the loophole will expire at the 
end of 1991 and the Legislature will fight any attempt by Shiley to carry it 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"Let them try to extend it, because they'll fail," Kopp said. "Their purpose 
will be transparent and . . . I . . . doubt that, with a new governor, their 
artifice will be successful."

For years GI Industries, the major hauler of residential trash in Simi Valley, 
Moorpark and Thousand Oaks, has been the rubbish king of eastern Ventura 
County. But in 1987 GI decided its empire wasn't big enough. 
</P>
<P>
GI, then controlled by the wealthy Asadurian family, began buying other 
businesses. Having already diversified into leasing garbage trucks and related 
equipment to other rubbish haulers, the company also bought Thrifty car-rental 
franchises and three Mack truck dealerships.

GI had revenue of $10 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, 1988. The 
deals to acquire Mack truck and Thrifty were to quadruple the company's size. 
"The numbers were right," GI Chairman Manuel Asadurian Sr. recalled. "It would 
make our stock go up." 
</P>
<P>
But the company's optimism turned out to be, well, rubbish. The diversification 
move was a flop, as GI's new subsidiaries hemorrhaged cash and sent the whole 
company into the red. GI, with nearly 50,000 residential and commercial rubbish 
customers, lost $1 million in fiscal 1988 and lost another $7.2 million in 
fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the mess delayed GI's completion of audited financial statements. 
Without those statements, banks were reluctant to lend GI much-needed cash, and 
at the end of fiscal 1989, GI's debts exceeded its assets by $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
At one point the four main members of the Asadurian family -- Manuel Asadurian 
Sr., 58; his brother Sam, 63; and their sons Manuel Jr., 33, and Carl, 38, 
respectively -- each had to lend the company $1 million so it could keep 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
By early 1989, "we knew we needed to make some drastic moves," said Daniel M. 
Van Rossen, GI's executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
At first, GI considered selling out to Western Waste Industries, a 
Gardena-based trash hauler, for an undisclosed sum. But talks between the 
companies fell apart last fall. 
</P>
<P>
So GI decided to pull back to the business that Sam and Manny Asadurian first 
pursued 40 years ago -- hauling garbage. "It's just like starting all over 
again," Manny Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
The company jettisoned its Thrifty car-leasing unit and Universal Mack Sales 
&amp; Service, the subsidiary that ran the Mack truck dealerships. The two 
businesses generated $27.5 million in revenue in fiscal 1989, but because of 
accounting rules those sales were not included in GI's results for that year, 
when reported total revenue was $11.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
GI slashed its corporate staff to three positions from 14, and its overall work 
force dropped to 80 from 212 because of employees who left when the businesses 
were sold. The company also sold 40% of equipment lease payments due the 
company, and some real estate. And it moved its headquarters from a leased 
office to a building the company already owned. All told, the actions enabled 
GI to cut its debt to about $20 million from $50 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a change in GI's top management left fewer Asadurians at the top, 
although the family's influence remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
Sam resigned as chief executive and chief financial officer, and in late 1989 
he purchased Universal Mack from the company. Manny Jr. quit as president, and 
his father added the posts of president and chief executive to his 
chairmanship. Van Rossen became chief financial officer. Carl remains head of 
GI's Conejo Enterprises rubbish-hauling division, and Michael Smith remains a 
senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
GI officials said Sam's decision to leave was his own. It would be unfair to 
say "there was pressure on Sam to step aside," Van Rossen said. "Sam left the 
company to take care of a number of things, not to mention possibly being 
semi-retired." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Asadurian did not return phone calls requesting comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Asadurians, who took GI public in 1987, also no longer control the 
company's board of directors or its stock. The five-member board now has Manny 
Sr., Carl and three non-Asadurians. The family's stock ownership fell to 44% of 
the total from 52% in late 1989 when GI issued 500,000 new shares to Mack 
Trucks Inc., the builder of Mack trucks, to help complete GI's sale of 
Universal Mack to Sam Asadurian. 
</P>
<P>
What stock the family still owns also has dropped sharply in value, to a recent 
over-the-counter price of about $2-$2.50 a share from $7.50 a share in early 
1988, giving the Asadurians' combined stake a current value of about $4 million 
to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rossen said "frustration is an understatement" to describe the mood at GI's 
headquarters in recent months. "I'm not an Asadurian," he said, "but I felt 
personally as bad as they did when these problems surfaced."

CARL'S JR. REPLACES OLD GLORY DECALS WITH A FLAGPOLE AND THE REAL THING

Carl Karcher Enterprises is a company known for wearing its patriotism on its 
sleeve -- or at least its windows. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the company has stuck large decals of Old Glory on the front windows 
of its Carl's Jr. restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the stickers have all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of flagging interest in the American dream? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based chain has installed a flagpole at 349 of its older locations 
in Southern California. Now it has begun making the same improvement at 60 
restaurants in Northern California, said Patricia Parks, a company spokeswoman. 
Each will fly two flags from its new pole. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the American flag on top and Carl's flag below," Parks said, adding that 
the company has always strived to show its support for the free enterprise 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The flag-waving spirit at Carl's goes beyond just the flagpoles. The company 
still opens its annual shareholders meeting with a recitation of the Pledge of 
Allegiance, Parks added.

The campaign will showcase the company's GT-Intensity model, recently 
introduced, that features gel cushioning for shock absorption and motion 
control. In the next phase of the TV campaign, Asics will feature its line of 
basketball shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Asic's fall line is "our largest ever, one that deserves an equally ambitious

KOLL CO., PARTNER BUY 297 ACRES FROM UNION PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Koll Co. and a Japanese partner have bought nearly 300 acres in Riverside 
County from Union Pacific Corp., and the Orange County developer said Wednesday 
it is negotiating to buy still more property from the railroad holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Koll and Ohbayashi America Corp., whose parent is one of the largest 
contractors in the world, paid $32 million for 297 acres in the unincorporated 
Mira Loma area at the northwestern tip of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The partners plan to turn the property into a business park. 
</P>
<P>
The deal comes several months after Koll's proposed $532-million purchase of 
most of Union Pacific's land and buildings fell through. It would have been 
Koll's biggest acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific, which operates the railroad of the same name, said the previous 
deal fell through because Koll and an unnamed partner couldn't prove they could 
come up with the money. Koll, however, said its financing was solid. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, since then Koll officials have continued to negotiate with Union 
Pacific for smaller pieces of property, including the Riverside County parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is Ohbayashi's second joint venture with Koll. The two 
companies are also building a $200-million, 28-story office tower in downtown 
Los Angeles. Ohbayashi has been in the development business in Southern 
California since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The partners said the Riverside County property will be used to construct 
buildings for lease or sale to businesses. They will also sell land to 
companies that want to construct their own buildings. The first parcels are 
expected to go on sale by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The huge Union Pacific deal that fell through included land and buildings in 19 
states. The Riverside County parcel was part of that transaction. 
</P>
<P>
One big West Coast developer who considered making an offer for the railroad 
property said recently that he considered it overpriced at half a billion 
dollars. Not so, said Chuck Schreiber, Koll Co. executive vice president in 
charge of acquiring property for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"People who say that obviously didn't study the property very closely," he 
said. "We spent a lot of time looking at it, and we were very happy with the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
The deal included railroad property as far east as the Washington suburbs and 
would have given Koll -- which calls itself the West Coast's largest property 
owner -- a toehold in the East. 
</P>
<P>
When the deal was announced in January, Koll was a little vague about whether 
it would develop the Washington property. Now the company isn't saying whether 
it is still negotiating to buy any of the Eastern properties or whether it will 
stick to buying some of the railroad's numerous West Coast holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad is selling its real estate because the development business hasn't 
been profitable enough to boost publicly held Union Pacific's stock price much. 
The railroad wanted to concentrate on its other, more profitable businesses.

NICHOLS INSTITUTE TO JOIN IN TEXAS LABORATORY VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Striving for further geographic expansion of its medical laboratory network, 
Nichols Institute said Wednesday that it has formed a joint venture with three 
major hospital systems in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano-based medical laboratory firm will act as the general 
partner in an alliance with Baylor Health System and Presbyterian Healthcare 
System, both based in Dallas, and Harris Methodist Health System, based in Ft. 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership will operate a 58,000-square-foot central laboratory in Irving, 
Tex., that will be shared by 18 hospitals as well as physicians serving North 
Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
While the hospitals will maintain labs for emergency and inpatient tests, they 
will refer outpatient work to the new Nichols Institute Laboratories North 
Texas Ltd. Annual revenues of the facility, which is expected to open late this 
year, are anticipated to exceed $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Habgood, a spokesman for Baylor Health Systems, said the hospitals 
sought an alliance with Nichols because of the firm's capability for doing 
complex diagnostic tests that the hospitals are unable to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols spokeswoman Katherine Murphy said the company has tried to develop 
partnerships with networks of hospitals for several years, but this is the 
first such arrangement it has established. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was described by Nichols' officials as a "prototype for 
health-care providers through the 1990s" and as a method to contain laboratory 
costs through consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts praised Nichols' joint venture with the Texas hospitals as 
an effective and economical method of business expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Joint venturing, the analysts noted, is less expensive than the acquisition of 
regional laboratories, which has been Nichols' chief growth strategy until now. 
Nichols has regional laboratories in California, the Pacific Northwest and the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
It also has a laboratory in San Juan Capistrano, where it performs esoteric 
tests referred from less sophisticated laboratories throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very positive for Nichols, in that it enables them to get rapid 
access in the marketplace there (in North Texas) without a significant 
investment," said Arda Minocherhomjee, a health care analyst with Chicago Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Bohringer, a securities analyst with Prudential Bache, called the joint 
venture "a significant development for the company. If it succeeds, it may 
represent a pattern of things to come."

DANA NIGUEL BANK N.A. SEEKS A STATE CHARTER; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE INSTITUTION WOULD TRADE IN ITS FEDERAL DESIGNATION TO INCREASE ITS 
LOANS TO ONE BORROWER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Attempting to take advantage of less-restrictive state banking laws, Dana 
Niguel Bank N.A. wants to trade in its national charter for a state charter, 
and its only remaining obstacle is obtaining shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, which concentrates on making construction loans to home builders, 
plans to use the state charter mainly to increase the amount it can lend to one 
borrower by at least 50% and up to 150%, said Charles Goodson, the bank's 
senior vice president and cashier. 
</P>
<P>
It also hopes to take advantage of a state law that would let it engage in real 
estate joint ventures, an activity prohibited by the national charter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only roadblock in the conversion process is shareholder approval. In the 
past, the 7 1/2-year-old bank has had trouble getting enough shareholders to 
cast their votes on major corporate changes, which require a two-thirds vote of 
total common shares outstanding. Bank executives are calling those with larger 
blocks to encourage them to attend the June 20 meeting or send in their 
proxies, Goodson said. 
</P>
<P>
As a national bank, Dana Niguel can lend about $600,000 to one borrower, and it 
has to ask other lending institutions to join in making bigger loans. Such loan 
participations in 1988 meant that about $150,000 in revenue went to co-lenders, 
Goodson said. Under a state charter, the bank could lend about $1.5 million to 
one builder. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we've given away significant profits under the national charter," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
With $70.6 million in assets at the end of December and $605,000 in net income 
last year, Dana Niguel Bank is one of Orange County's solid performers, 
according to Gerry Findley, a banking consultant based in Brea. He added that 
the charter change makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
The bank "wants to take advantage of opportunities, and that's smart in today's 
world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The switch to state charter would be the third such conversion of a 
county-based bank since 1987, when Corporate National Bank in Santa Ana became 
Corporate Bank. Mariners Bank N.A. became simply Mariners Bank last year. The 
abbreviation N.A. is for National Assn. Dana Niguel's conversion would leave 16 
of the county's 38 banks with national charters. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Niguel's changeover, which was approved by state regulators last December, 
comes at a time when federal regulators are clamping down on the real estate 
lending habits of national banks. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., recently 
identified Orange County as one of the riskier areas for banks to make real 
estate loans. But his comments were challenged immediately by James E. 
Gilleran, superintendent of the California Department of State Banking, who saw 
no reason for undue concern about lending on Orange County or other California 
real estate.

When it came to keeping his patients fully informed about their health, Dr. 
Nelson Kraus used a method of communication that might have made some 
physicians bristle. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to sit down at a round table beside the patient," Kraus said. "I'd put 
a tape recorder in the middle of that table, put in a 60-minute cassette and 
we'd talk. Then I'd give the tape to the patients so they could take it home 
and replay it. 
</P>
<P>
"They loved it. They said they played it several times and each time they heard 
something they hadn't heard before. And they played it with other family 
members." 
</P>
<P>
Kraus, a former family practitioner working in medical communication for the 
past 10 years, says other doctors may not agree with the way that he 
communicated with his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Some doctors would have said the first place the patient goes with that tape 
is to the lawyer," he said, but noted that such openness between patient and 
doctor could cut down on the malpractice suits. 
</P>
<P>
"The more information the patient gets, the more involved the patient gets with 
the care, the less likely the patient is to sue," he said. "The doctor becomes 
a partner, but the doctor is not responsible. The patient is responsible for 
his own health." 
</P>
<P>
Kraus parlayed his communicating skills into the Health News Network, a series 
of health vignettes that air on 31 radio stations in four states and a Columbus 
television station, but he acknowledged that there are difficulties on both 
sides for that communication. 
</P>
<P>
"Patients are intimidated by a person who knows a lot of things they don't," he 
said. "There is a fear on the part of the patient that if he becomes angry or 
upset, the quality of care may go down." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are busy, often seeing as many as 85 sick people a day, he said. By the 
nature of their training, some doctors can be egocentric and arrogant, and some 
don't know how to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"They know how to ask questions, they know how to interrupt answers, and they 
know how to give orders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he's a firm believer that the patient needs to be the aggressor when it 
comes to talking with the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between talking to and talking with," he said. "Talking 
with means the doctor has to do a lot of listening." 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the patient try and talk to the doctor on an equal basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's someone with a high school education or less, looking at someone who is 
speaking a foreign language to him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters is the dynamics of the situation. The patient usually is 
sitting on an examining table, wearing a flimsy gown and shivering. The doctor, 
wearing a white coat, is standing there holding the patient's records. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus suggests that the doctor and patient try to talk when the patient is 
fully clothed and that the doctor not sit behind a desk. 
</P>
<P>
"The patient should position himself between the door and the doctor," he said. 
"The doctor would have to go over, under, around and through the patient to get 
out of the office." 
</P>
<P>
He also suggests that the patient jot down questions between visits and have 
that paper in hand when facing the doctor. The patient should also write down 
things that the doctor says in the office. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason patients don't hear or retain is that they are nervous and they are 
scared of what they don't want to hear," Kraus said.

SHOCKED DOESN'T RETREAT; SHE STILL SUPPLIES HIGH VOLTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In switching from her folk-based songs to the seemingly less-confrontational 
jump-blues pleasures of her current horn-driven "Captain Swing" album, Michelle 
Shocked has some fans and critics thinking she's abandoned her radical 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House Tuesday night, Shocked's overwhelming, life-charged 21-song 
performance made it clear she's not retreating, just exploring other avenues of 
liberation. Specifically, her performance asserted, there's no point in manning 
the front lines unless you've also got your backfield in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting far into her set, the slight, impish singer felt it necessary to 
justify her recent changes to the audience. She wryly maintained, "It's no 
secret that political correctness has been a serious social disease for the 
last several years. . . . Don't make the mistakes I did." In prescribing 
shaking some booty to Professor Longhair tapes as a cure, she went on to quote 
radical forbear Emma Goldman: "What good's a revolution if I can't dance?" 
</P>
<P>
Shocked's flat-out-wonderful, dance-happy music needed no justifying manifesto. 
Like the glory days of ululant "wop mop a lu mop" rock, the wild, unfettered 
spirit of the singer and her six-piece Captain Swing Revue conveyed all the 
liberation one could ask for. 
</P>
<P>
With some input from her producer, Pete Anderson (who also helms Dwight 
Yoakam's recordings and is a master guitarist in his own right), Shocked has 
assembled a monstrously good band, with a stylistic purview ranging from 
swinging Louis Jordan-influenced jump arrangements to free jazz to rampant 
rockabilly. 
</P>
<P>
Though Shocked's voice is far from naturally suited to the rigors of a 
horn-blaring outfit, she pushed her limitations and communicated the crucial 
life and emotion often missed by more skilled singers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes awash in the band's anarchic-but-tight musical melee, her lyrics 
remained politically incisive -- as with the current album's "homeless trilogy" 
of "God Is a Real Estate Developer," "The Cement Lament" and "Streetcorner 
Ambassador" -- and evocative of the byways of American life. With a rare eye 
for detail, "(Making the Run to) Gladewater" beautifully delineated adolescent 
life in a small Texas town.

Throughout that song and others, the band members provided a constant foil for 
Shocked. In place of the refined fire of Anderson's playing on the albums, band 
guitarist Jon Dee Graham delivered wrenching, emotional guitar lines. 
Keyboardist Skip Edwards ranged from gospel organ hues to Longhair-ed romps on 
his instrument, while horn players Jim Pollock and Darrell Leonard touched on 
everything from Sidney Bechet to Don Cherry in their spirited playing. 
</P>
<P>
In expanding her musical scope, Shocked has by no means lost touch with her 
folk finesse. She did a mid-show solo acoustic turn, playing the haunting, 
fragile reminiscence "Memories of East Texas," "5 a.m. in Amsterdam," an a 
cappella Steve Goodman anti-war ode, and a mandolin and fiddle instrumental 
tune, "Jeff Davis," on which she was joined by her father and brother. 
</P>
<P>
Her closing encore song, the unreleased "Makin' Jam," recommended eschewing the 
"corporate jam factories" because "If you want the best, you've got to make 
your own." 
</P>
<P>
As the band percolated under her voice, Shocked made her point more explicit: 
"If there's one thing that I want you to know, it's that if I can do this, you 
can do it too. . . . When it comes down to it, there's a thing true about music 
and politics: They're both too important to be left to professionals like us." 
</P>
<P>
If that isn't the basic -- though all but subverted lately -- message of rock 
and roll, what is? 
</P>
<P>
Opener John Wesley Harding fared better with the audience than when he first 
appeared at the Coach House a few months back. He earned an encore call this 
time, but his performance remained more clever than compelling. One could do 
worse than to draw on Elvis Costello as a signal influence -- along with 
Harding's comparatively tortured wordplay, he's got the Big E's vocal 
inflections down to a T -- but Harding's own limited talents couldn't help 
looking that much thinner when he so often borrowed Costello's big suit.

A NEW WAY TO HELP THOSE HYPER KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Thompson is an appealing, freckle-faced boy who loves to play and draws 
pictures of startling insight for an 11-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark has been neither a joy to raise nor a pleasure to teach. His parents 
paint a grim picture of Mark's elementary school years and note that his 
first-grade teacher still shudders when she hears his name. 
</P>
<P>
Mark is one of those "hyper" kids, the one in a room of 30 students who won't 
stay in his seat, refuses to follow directions and picks a fight over the most 
trivial of issues. Everyone seems to know a kid like Mark, but the reality is 
that more misinformation and misunderstanding swirl around the label 
"hyperactive" than thoughtful treatment of the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Sue and Dave Thompson were luckier than many parents of hyperactive children in 
that they found their way early to doctors who accurately diagnosed Mark's 
problem. But a treatment that produced adequate results eluded them until last 
fall, when Mark entered an unusual program combining special educational 
services for hyperactive youngsters with the medical and psychiatric treatment 
many of them need. 
</P>
<P>
The program is a joint venture between the child development center of UC 
Irvine and Newport Harbor, a private adolescent psychiatric hospital in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Expected by its proponents to be a model for such efforts nationally, the 
9-month-old program seeks to combine in one setting every form of education and 
therapy known to work with hyperactive children. The goal is to intervene early 
and comprehensively to save them from often crippling school and social 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
It will be several years, however, before long-term results of the program's 
intensive, five-day-a-week curriculum are known. The Thompsons, nevertheless, 
are enthusiastic, having seen dramatic improvement in Mark's self-esteem and in 
his willingness to take responsibility for schoolwork and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Says Dave Thompson: "The people at UCI are so caring and concerned about him 
that they don't make mistakes and with a wrong word knock the legs out from 
under him." 
</P>
<P>
Hyperactivity is believed to result from a brain condition, present at birth, 
that makes afflicted children unable to control their impulses or focus on a 
school lesson or other task. 
</P>
<P>
The condition has been called many things, but the proper medical term today is 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. Various estimates suggest 
that from 3% to 10% of elementary school-age children are afflicted. They face 
a gloomy future, with extremely high school dropout rates, as well as problems 
with alcoholism, drug abuse, even criminal behavior later in life. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment in recent years has depended greatly on the drug Ritalin 
(methylphenidate), a powerful stimulant that in some ADHD sufferers 
paradoxically has a calming effect, helping the children follow through on 
tasks and respond to direction. But Ritalin became controversial a decade ago 
when there emerged evidence of excessive and indiscriminate use on children who 
may have acted up in school but lacked the medical history or supervision to 
justify medication. 
</P>
<P>
The drug has also been criticized for masking the underlying problems of ADHD, 
and few specialists today would recommend its use without accompanying therapy 
for behavioral and emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
"ADHD has enormous emotional implications," says Dr. Paul Hoernig, a child 
psychiatrist at Newport Harbor who treats Mark and meets regularly with his 
parents. "These children have a higher degree of learning disorders, fine motor 
and coordination problems, dyslexia (a neurological reading handicap). All of 
these problems, unfortunately, feed on one another. Sending a child home with 
2,000 Ritalin tablets just doesn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
Mark is the youngest of the seven children brought together when the Thompsons 
married six years ago. He is Dave Thompson's fourth child; Sue has two grown 
sons and a teen-age daughter. Until Dave and Sue married, Mark and his brother, 
Matt, now 13, lived primarily with their paternal grandparents. But Sue 
Thompson says she often had the boys over to her house on weekends during those 
early years and felt she got to know them well even before she became their 
stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark was always what I thought of as the perfect baby -- happy, loving, 
contented," Sue Thompson recalls. "Then he started preschool." 
</P>
<P>
There he began to show the behavior that labeled him a problem student 
throughout his elementary years. He was fine when left alone to play as he 
wished. He was uncooperative whenever someone tried to get him to do something 
else. And, he did not respond to discipline. 
</P>
<P>
In kindergarten, his behavior worsened, but the Thompsons attributed that to 
their recent marriage and the upheaval it produced in young Mark's life. He and 
Matt moved from their grandparents' house to the Thompsons' home in Huntington 
Beach and started a new school. But while Matt seemed to adjust, Mark held 
himself apart, defiant. He refused to call Sue Thompson "Mom" as his brother 
did, and neither punishment nor reward influenced his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of kindergarten, he had become so disruptive at home and in school 
that the Thompsons decided to consult a child psychologist. The psychologist 
immediately suspected ADHD, and testing confirmed his hunch. Mark was put on 
Ritalin. 
</P>
<P>
It helped his concentration somewhat, but his behavior continued to worsen 
through first grade. He refused to do homework. His standard responses to most 
requests or suggestions at home were "I don't care," "I can't do it" or "I 
won't." When things didn't go his way, the reproach he hurled at every family 
member was "You don't love me." 
</P>
<P>
"As time went on, it was 'I don't care and I'm going to kill myself and you 
wouldn't care,' " Sue Thompson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Because Mark scored high on intelligence tests administered at school, it was 
very difficult to get remedial help, counseling or behavioral training through 
the school, the Thompsons say. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Thompson, who, as an administrator at Marina High School in Huntington 
Beach, is better equipped than most for such bureaucratic battles, described 
the effort as "extremely frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was Mark's label: He was classified as a behavior problem, not 
learning disabled, and most of the services outside the classroom were for the 
children in the latter group. 
</P>
<P>
As he got older and bigger, Mark became less manageable. His uncooperativeness 
in school turned menacingly aggressive. He would tip over a desk rather than 
sit down and do a reading lesson. With other children, he mostly engaged in 
fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell him his shirt was ugly and that would be enough for him to tear 
into you," Dave Thompson says. 
</P>
<P>
The second through fourth grades were marked by repeated calls from school 
officials reporting Mark's latest misbehavior. His grades deteriorated. He 
could barely read. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the battles were constant. He became withdrawn and unable to 
articulate any feelings, even when his adored grandfather died, then his 
grandmother, slowly, of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In desperation, the Thompsons had Mark admitted for 10 weeks to the children's 
psychiatric unit of UCI Medical Center, hoping someone there could unravel the 
mystery of him. They took special classes at the hospital to learn how to 
better manage Mark's outbursts at home. His Ritalin dose was adjusted, but 
fundamentally, Mark remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
A consultation with an expert in ADHD led the Thompsons last fall to the 
UCI-Newport Harbor program, at the university's Child Development Center, 19262 
Jamboree Road, Irvine. Mark entered fifth grade there. 
</P>
<P>
The school part of the program is run by the university. It covers kindergarten 
through fifth grade, with space for 45 children. Eight of these places are 
reserved for children who also need psychiatric treatment, which is provided at 
the school by Newport Harbor staff. 
</P>
<P>
Mark, who was found to be suffering from severe depression in addition to ADHD, 
is among the eight. 
</P>
<P>
Both the educational and therapeutic program provide the individual attention 
that children with ADHD desperately need. Instruction is in small groups. 
Emphasis is on building the children's self-esteem and teaching them social 
skills. Eventually, the children learn how to monitor their own behavior to 
ensure its appropriateness. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about everything that's been identified in the literature as helpful with 
this population is being done in one place," says Ronald Kotkin, a UCI 
psychologist at the school. In the afternoon, Lauralee Flaherty, a Newport 
Harbor nurse-therapist, works with Mark and other children on art, cooking, 
gamesmanship and projects aimed at helping them express their feelings and 
develop interpersonal skills. 
</P>
<P>
"They are constantly learning how to monitor their behavior and interactions 
with others and how to ignore distractions going on around them," explains 
Frances Baumgarten, a Newport Harbor psychologist who supervises the 
therapeutic program. 
</P>
<P>
All of this effort does not come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for the school and afternoon therapy is $418 a day, according to 
Edward C. Morton Jr., administrator of Newport Harbor. Although the Orange 
County Department of Education supplies the teachers, all other staff and 
program costs are paid through fees. Morton says coverage depends upon the 
family's health insurance plan, but some private insurers will cover as much as 
90 percent of the costs under mental-health benefits. Medi-Cal does not cover 
any, Morton says. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Thompson has thrived in the program. This term, he has consistently earned 
top points for school behavior and is getting along much better at home, his 
parents report. He smiles and laughs and even sings when he gets up in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, this is a happy kid now!" Sue Thompson exults. 
</P>
<P>
Next fall, Mark will return to a regular sixth grade, bolstered by a 
therapeutic dosage of Ritalin and a structure at home that mirrors the behavior 
modifying techniques of the UCI-Newport Harbor program. The Thompsons have 
their fingers crossed that re-entry into a crowded public school classroom 
won't undo Mark's accomplishments of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Those behind the UCI-Newport Harbor program will be watching Mark just as 
closely in their effort to address the dilemma of ADHD. With so many children 
afflicted, the benefits of helping them get through school and manage their 
behavior could be as high as the costs to society of their failures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Views Into Young Minds 
</P>
<P>
Mark and the rest of the ADHD children were asked last November to draw one 
picture of themselves before they entered the UC Irvine/Newport Harbor Hospital 
program and another picture of how they hoped to look at the end of the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise is art therapy, used to help them express feelings without having 
to verbalize them, which is especially difficult for children with 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Mark drew his future self to look like Albert Einstein. He included a light 
bulb to represent the creative ideas he expected to emerge from his newly 
disciplined brain. 
</P>
<P>
In his self-portrait before therapy, Mark drew what he described as a "wild 
brain" that "can't settle down." He sketched a gun at the base with bullets 
flying toward the main part of the brain. He told his therapist that someone 
should "just shoot it. It's retarded."

JOSEPH N. BELL: NICE MIX OF LAW AND IDEALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks ago, 15 homeless people who had filed suit against the city of 
Santa Ana for confiscating their personal possessions were awarded about $3,300 
each in a settlement with the city. Deep in the story, it was noted that their 
attorney, Christopher Mears, took no fee and charged only $373 as reimbursement 
for expenses. That seemed remarkable enough to look up Mears and see what he 
was about. 
</P>
<P>
First off, he didn't find his waiving of a fee all that remarkable. "It happens 
a lot more often than you think," he said. "Personal injury lawyers" -- which 
he is -- "take a bad rap. It's a popular stereotype that has existed for years 
and is substantiated by a few bad apples, when nine-tenths are hard-working, 
sincere professionals. But no one is allowed to have good motives anymore. I'm 
really sick and tired that the only image of lawyers the public seems to have 
is this greedy stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
We were talking in his bright, airy office in a converted grain silo in the Old 
Town of Irvine. His windows look out on a background of mountains and a 
foreground of agricultural fields, staked out for the summer's crop. "When I 
come in in the early morning," he said a little dreamily, "and the sun is 
coming up behind this building, the stakes cast fantastic shadow patterns." 
</P>
<P>
This is the anomaly of Mears, a short, stocky man with longish, dark-brown hair 
forever drifting over his forehead and an almost cherubic face, rather like a 
clean-shaven Robin Williams. He is coldly surgical in court -- I watched him 
questioning a Westminster police officer who shot and killed the 18-year-old 
son of a Latino family he is representing -- and almost wistfully optimistic 
about the potential humanity of most people, as well as fiercely defensive of 
their rights. Especially those who are powerless in the Orange County social 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Mears is a second-generation Orange County native who graduated from Santa Ana 
High School in 1969, won his law degree from Western State University ("I 
wanted to be a lawyer ever since I saw 'To Kill a Mockingbird' as a child"), 
and practiced in an Orange County firm until he went out on his own about five 
years ago. His biggest settlement was $15.5 million for an elderly woman whose 
medical insurance was canceled on the basis of a fraudulent report. (It was 
later reduced to $2 million, then settled out of court when that figure was 
appealed.) He takes all his cases, without apology, on a contingency basis -- 
usually, he says, one-third -- and mostly on behalf of people who couldn't 
otherwise afford an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"I was infected in the 1960s with the idealism of my times," he says. "And it 
was easy because my schoolteacher mother -- who raised me with my grandmother 
-- was the most non-judgmental person I still have ever met. She taught my 
brother and me that we weren't any better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Mears got involved in the homeless case when Orange County Legal Aid called and 
asked him to help. It took two years, and he probably could have won a sizable 
fee from the city had he taken the case to court, but he chose to settle it and 
get some money in the hands of the people he was representing. 
</P>
<P>
"It could very well turn their lives around," he said. "I know one of them 
bought a car so he could get to job interviews. Another bought a ticket back 
home where he hopes to rebuild his life. Many of them used the money for 
housing so they would have a base from which to look for work. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of these people could make the transition back into society with less 
help than most people realize. Most of them work as often as they can. They 
just can't get enough money together to break out of the vicious circle of 
looking unkempt because they live on the street and being unable to receive 
mail or offer a resume or complete a job interview because they don't have an 
address." 
</P>
<P>
He told about two brothers -- skilled mechanics from a Montana town where work 
had dried up -- who came to Orange County looking for jobs. They slept in their 
car to save money, and one day the car was impounded for being illegally parked 
while the brothers were applying for work. They didn't have enough money to get 
the car out of hock, the cost of retrieving it is growing daily, and they are 
on the streets -- dealing with a system that has no flexibility to help them 
out of this dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
He also told about one of his homeless clients who found a laboring job that 
required him to be at work at 5:30 a.m. Because the buses didn't run that 
early, this man walked from Santa Ana to Anaheim every morning to report for 
work that still didn't pay him enough to get him off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"In cities like New York and Chicago," he says, "you step over homeless people. 
You can't ignore them. But in Santa Ana, the homeless people were trying to 
stay out of sight, stashing their things under bushes. That makes the city of 
Santa Ana even more despicable for coming in with a slash-and-burn policy that 
not only ignored basic constitutional rights but, even more important, violated 
all the standards of human decency." 
</P>
<P>
So what about the rights of the businessmen who put heat on the city because 
they don't want the homeless camping out on their doorsteps? 
</P>
<P>
"They have a legitimate beef," Mears says, "but there are ways of dealing with 
this without doing violence to people's possessions. I can't solve the homeless 
problem in this conversation. But I do know one thing for sure: It has to start 
with the right level of concern -- with humanity and caring. This isn't just 
liberal naivete. Change has to start from within, and when it starts from that 
point, when we have the right attitude, answers will be forthcoming. It's only 
when we try to avoid or ignore the problem or function in spite of it that it 
doesn't get resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Mears thinks it is easier to ignore these social problems in Orange County 
"because the veneer of normalcy is very thick here, very insidious. But there 
are also signs of hope. Every day I can see at least as many people helping 
others as hurting them. Each one of us is either part of the problem or part of 
the solution, and I guess I'm not cynical because I believe in the inherent 
humanity of man and in the power of the individual to bring about change." 
</P>
<P>
To which 15 erstwhile homeless Santa Ana residents who are using a new-found 
stake to try to get their lives back on track would say a fervent "Amen."

GOP CANDIDATES FOR HILL'S ASSEMBLY SEAT RELY HEAVILY ON OWN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight Republicans competing for the state Assembly seat formerly occupied by 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier), now a state senator, have raised more than $500,000 
for their campaigns, but most of it has come out of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar Councilman Paul Horcher has loaned his campaign $171,815, according 
to a financial statement he filed with the Los Angeles County Registrar of 
Voters. Others who have loaned large amounts to their own campaigns, according 
to their financial statements, are Wil Baca, an engineer and businessman, who 
has put up more than $50,000; Phil Mautino, an attorney, who has kicked in 
$46,000; and Kenneth Manning, a general contractor and school board member, who 
has loaned himself $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, Mautino and former legislative staff member Tony Russo are the only 
candidates in the district who have raised more than $40,000 from sources other 
than their own personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Russo said new campaign financing rules have made fund raising difficult. 
Voters adopted an initiative two years ago that puts a $1,000 ceiling on 
donations from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most political action committees representing businesses, unions 
and trade associations have stayed out of the 52nd District race, candidates 
said, because it is so wide open and they prefer to back likely winners. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher said he has poured a lot of his own money into the campaign because he 
started raising funds late. "If I'm not willing to invest in myself, I can't 
ask others to," Horcher said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley on Tuesday will vote on eight Assembly seats. Five 
incumbents are running unopposed in the primary but will face challenges in the 
November elections. The other races are contested. 
</P>
<P>
They include the battle to replace Hill in the Assembly. In addition, voters 
will pick successors to Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), who resigned his 59th 
Assembly District seat after winning election to the state Senate, and to 
Charles Bader (R-Pomona), who is giving up his 65th Assembly District seat to 
run against Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) in November. 
</P>
<P>
In the 59th District, Marta Maestas, who was Calderon's aide, and Xavier 
Becerra, a state deputy attorney general, have both raised more than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to the Maestas campaign include $5,000 each from the California 
Medical Assn. and the California Teachers Assn. Becerra's total includes $9,000 
he has loaned to his own campaign at 10% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Martinez, a member of the Garvey school board, has raised more than 
$67,000, including $1,000 from her father, Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey 
Park), and another $1,000 from his campaign committee. Other $1,000 
contributions have come from the campaign committees of Reps. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica), Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City) and Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo.) Martinez has put nearly $40,000 of her own 
money into her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Financial statements for two other candidates in the Democratic primary, Bill 
Edward Hernandez, a member of the Rio Hondo Community College board of 
trustees, and Larry Salazar, a marketing consultant, were not on file Tuesday 
at the county Registrar of Voters office. 
</P>
<P>
In the 65th Assembly District, Jim Brulte, who served as Bader's chief of staff 
and has his endorsement, has a wide lead in fund raising over his Republican 
primary opponent, Mark A. T. Nymeyer, a Pomona councilman. Brulte has raised 
more than $150,000. His largest donation was $3,000 from the California Real 
Estate Assn. Nymeyer has raised more than $44,000, including $1,000 from a 
committee of Pomona firefighters and $1,000 from Pomona City Atty. Arnold 
Glasman. 
</P>
<P>
The totals raised for the Assembly primary campaigns are dwarfed by the amounts 
that Ayala and Bader have raised for their 34th Senate District contest in 
November. Ayala has collected more than $187,000 so far this year, giving him 
more than $450,000 for his reelection bid. Bader has raised more than $148,000 
this year, boosting his campaign fund total to more than $355,000. Both men are 
running unopposed for their respective parties' nominations in Tuesday's 
primary. Most of the district is in San Bernardino County, but it includes part 
of Pomona.

MID CITY: THRIVING AMID CHANGE

Buses run up and down the streets of Santa Ana's Mid City neighborhood with the 
frequency of new lovers -- another one will be along any minute. And it's a 
good thing, too. The buses give residents mobility and a feeling of 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Latino section has few of the conveniences associated with 
living in the suburbs. There aren't strip shopping centers, banks, dry cleaners 
or even gas stations on every block; there are no big chain supermarkets or 
major retail stores within easy walking distance. But the neighborhood still 
manages to take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
It is a place where small businesses thrive and Latino store owners and the 
community rely on one another. Most of the shop signs are in Spanish, making 
those businesses a comfort zone in a neighborhood with a healthy mix of 
first-generation American-born Latinos, longtime immigrants and Mexican 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
The Clinica Medica Latina is here, as well as other businesses dealing with 
everything from aseguranza (insurance) to immigration. The Top Value Super 
Mercado is the all-purpose general store. Signs in the windows announce 
"boletos de Lotteria aqui" (lottery tickets here), the availability of giros 
(money orders) for 15 cents and that the store accepts estampillas de comida 
(food stamps). 
</P>
<P>
Inside, name-brand groceries line the shelves, but the store also makes room 
for specialty items and Mexican delicacies. Near the entrance, a woman rolls 
fresh hot churros in a sugar-and-cinnamon mixture, while 10 feet away a 
matronly woman sells tortillas hechos a manos (handmade tortillas) for $1.35 
per dozen. 
</P>
<P>
In the meat case, tripe, catfish, pig feet, tongue and beef lips kiss glass 
display windows. And in another section of the mercado, there are 
Spanish-language videos for rent, T-shirts for sale at three for $9 and a 
variety of other products imported from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But Mid City is also a neighborhood in transition. As much as the area takes 
care of its own in commerce, in other aspects, things are beginning to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy Santa Ana; there are a lot of nice people here. It's just been in the 
last few months. . . ," lamented Guadalupe Saenz, a ten-year resident of Mid 
City who also works as a clerk at the neighborhood's elementary school. "People 
used to keep up their yards and lawns -- we didn't have any problems, but now. 
. . ," her voice trails off. 
</P>
<P>
But now there are signs of trouble with a capital "T" and that rhymes with "G" 
and that stands for graffiti, which is generally followed by the other "G" 
word: gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand this," Saenz said. "I've met gang members who are really 
nice kids. But it's like they have a split personality. At home, they're really 
good kids, but outside on the street when they're with their gangs. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the majority of youths in the neighborhood are not in gangs, but 
the small percentage who are cause major headaches for the rest. "Not every kid 
you see is in a gang," said Cpl. Rick Reese of the Santa Ana Police 
Department's gang detail. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good kids out there who never receive any credit. Gang 
members are in the minority, but they're at the forefront because of all the 
violence," he explained. "It's getting out of hand. They may have gotten into 
gangs to protect the barrio, but they only end up ruining it. Where there are 
no gangs, there are no problems." 
</P>
<P>
As disturbing as the appearance of graffiti is -- along with its implications 
-- Mid City has a way to go before it has the gang problems of other 
neighborhoods. The fact that it doesn't yet is a tribute to the tenacity and 
determination of parents who are working with the area school to give their 
children alternatives to the downward, unproductive lifestyle of gangs. A big 
part of that success is spelled P-T-A. 
</P>
<P>
The PTA at Martin Elementary School has managed to turn outrage into outreach. 
"Our parents are an active part of our school," said Helen M. Matthews, the 
school's principal. "We have meetings on the third Wednesday of every month, 
and at every meeting we have between 200 and 250 parents. They are always 
willing to help." 
</P>
<P>
To help prevent students from becoming targets for drugs and gangs, school 
programs such as the city-sponsored, after-school PRIDE (Parks and Recreation 
Inspire Dignity and Esteem) Club and the police-sponsored DARE (Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education) program are heartily endorsed by parents and heavily 
attended by children. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't stop there. The parents aren't satisfied with shifting all the 
responsibility to the schools. They use tips garnered from PTA meetings on how 
to help their children with homework; and when the school needed to stock the 
new computer lab, the PTA mobilized, raised $3,000 and supplied the lab with 
one-third of the requisite equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The parents get involved in other ways, too. Within the 250-strong PTA is a 
small core group of volunteers who regularly help at the school by painting 
over graffiti, which appears sporadically, working as teachers' aides in the 
classroom and duplicating flyers, bulletins or whatever else the school needs. 
</P>
<P>
The backbone of that core group is Cristina Garcia, president of the School 
Site Council. "Mrs. Garcia is one of our main contributors. She is always there 
when we need her," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
Other supporters include Raquel Martinez, a grandmother who volunteers a lot of 
her time at the school; Socorro Gonzales, the PTA president; Maria Pino, a 
parent-volunteer who helps with fund-raising activities; and Rosa Perez, who 
was praised by President Bush at Santa Ana Stadium in March for her involvement 
in fighting gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
As Guadalupe Saenz points out, there are a lot of good people in the 
neighborhood. And while some change may be inevitable in Mid City, it will be 
tempered by a history of cooperation and fine-tuned by a generation of children 
who are growing up experiencing the positive aspects of having a whole 
neighborhood watching out for them.

NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING PERMIT VALUATIONS

The value of non-residential building in the county is going south. During this 
year's first quarter, $284.2 million worth or such permits were issued, 23% 
below the total for the comparable period last year. The 1990 January through 
March valuations were not only less than in 1989; this was the lowest-valued 
first quarter in any of the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was not alone in this situation. Each of the surrounding counties 
also came in below last year's first three months, with the exception of San 
Bernardino County. Valuations there increased 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall decline, there were increases in three of the five major 
categories of building: Permits for industrial buildings increased 90% over 
last year's first three months; stores and mercantile buildings were up 6%, and 
hotels/motels 51%. Decreases in office buildings and alterations/additions 
dragged the overall total lower.

WOULD-BE ASSASSIN TESTIFIES OF JAILHOUSE PLOT IN BROWN CASE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A WITNESS SAYS HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL THREE KEY FIGURES IN THE MURDER 
PROSECUTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted drug offender, testifying in the murder trial of David Arnold 
Brown, Wednesday squared off in court against a prosecutor whom he once planned 
to assassinate and gave a vivid account of jailhouse loyalties and betrayals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was contracted for a murder for hire," proclaimed former inmate Richard 
Steinhart, a burly, tattooed man. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Steinhart testified that Brown promised him half a million 
dollars to "terminate" three key figures in his murder prosecution -- and 
actually delivered $22,700 of it before their plot was thwarted by a third 
inmate who "snitched" on them early last year. 
</P>
<P>
As Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson neared the end of his case against 
Brown, he introduced Steinhart's testimony in an attempt to portray the 
defendant as a man capable of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was arrested in September, 1988, for allegedly orchestrating his wife's 
shooting death in their Garden Grove home in 1985, then setting up his 
14-year-old daughter to take the fall for it and collecting $835,000 in 
insurance money himself. He later married the victim's sister, Patti Bailey, 
who has since pleaded guilty to murder as a juvenile for her role in the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
While in jail awaiting trial on those charges in early 1989, Brown allegedly 
plotted with Steinhart to murder three people: his wife, Patti Bailey, who has 
cooperated in his prosecution, prosecutor Robinson and Jay Newell, an 
investigator for the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Steinhart said he met Brown soon after entering the Orange 
County Jail in December, 1988, on a parole violation from an earlier cocaine 
conviction. He said the pair quickly hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Brown was undergoing a preliminary hearing that would result in 
his having to stand trial for murder. Steinhart said Brown seemed desperate, 
convinced that his defense was "deteriorating all around him." He said Brown 
maintained his innocence throughout their relationship, asserting that he was 
being "screwed" by the district attorney's office and by Patti Bailey for 
something he didn't do. 
</P>
<P>
The two men soon began talking in detail about escape and murder, Steinhart 
said. Steinhart said they agreed that he would shoot the three dead once he 
left jail and then help Brown escape. Then, Steinhart said, he was to receive 
as much as $500,000 that Brown had buried in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhart, now out of custody and in a drug rehabilitation center in Lake 
Elsinore, said that if he could have figured out a way to double-cross Brown 
without actually killing anyone, "I would have let him rot." 
</P>
<P>
But if murder was the only way to collect the money, he added: "I had full 
intent to do it." 
</P>
<P>
What he didn't count on, and what Brown would not know until weeks after the 
plot was in motion, was the role of a third inmate, Joseph Drake, who tipped 
off authorities to the scheme in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhart seemed disoriented during his testimony but said it was the result of 
medication he is taking for a recently diagnosed AIDS-related illness. But he 
spoke clearly and vehemently about the intricate jailhouse system of inmates 
who provide insider information to authorities in hopes of getting time off 
their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with authorities about the scheme in January, 1989, Steinhart said, 
he agreed to wear a bugging device to record several dozen incriminating and 
detailed conversations between him and Brown, conversations that have already 
been played in court for the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But he denied suggestions from defense attorney Gary Pohlson that he has 
profited from his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Steinhart lashed out in a mocking tone at the district attorney's 
office for what he called the "fine accommodations" that he had gotten in jail 
after his cooperation and for what he described as the shoddy protection that 
he said the office gives its witnesses.

<P>
Two members of a skinheads gang were released from jail this morning while 
investigators attempted to gather more evidence that they broke into a Palmdale 
woman's new home and scrawled threats, swastikas and satanic symbols on the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Todd Evans, 18, of Palmdale, and Thomas Conroy, 19, a transient, were 
arrested Tuesday on suspicion of vandalism and breaking and entering after Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies found evidence leading to them, Sgt. Ron 
Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism was discovered Tuesday in the home in the 5300 block of Blue Sage 
Road by a contractor working in the housing development. Mary Termini, a 
66-year-old widow, was in the process of moving into the home from Sylmar. When 
she was called to the house Tuesday she found much of her property damaged and 
black writing on several walls. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and Conroy were arrested at a gang hangout when deputies found that their 
shoes closely matched footprints found in Termini's home, Shreves said.

A girl who attended the McMartin Pre-School testified today that former teacher 
Ray Buckey molested her, threatened to harm her parents if she told them and 
slaughtered a rabbit in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, now 13, is the third and final child to testify at Buckey's retrial 
that he molested them at the now-defunct nursery in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the girl was molested between November, 1979, and June, 
1981. Buckey, 32, has steadfastly maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Deputy Dist. Atty. Pam Ferrero, the girl testified that 
Buckey molested her while playing a naked sex game called "Horsey." 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions during her testimony, the girl replied, "I don't 
remember," when asked for details of the molestations.

Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was slightly injured in a collision between 
his limousine and a military bus on the outskirts of Moscow, Tass news agency 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev, asked at a regular news 
briefing about the accident Wednesday morning, said the premier received some 
bumps but "feels just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the accident, the bus was approaching Ryzhkov's limousine on a 
highway on the western edge of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said a security car in Ryzhkov's motorcade alerted the bus by flashing its 
lights, and the bus pulled aside. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus's wheels struck the curb, the bus spun and blocked the road, prompting 
the collision," an official told Tass.

SPILLED LOAD OF SULFUR CLOSES I-5 NEAR NORTH L.A. COUNTY LINE

<TEXT>
<P>
A load of dry sulfur spilled and caught fire on the Interstate 5 this morning, 
forcing the closure of all lanes of the Golden State Freeway near the northern 
Los Angeles County line, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
All northbound lanes were closed at 9:30 a.m. when a tractor-trailer pulling 
two flatbed trailers skidded during a light rain and dozens of 50-pound bags of 
sulfur spilled across four lanes of the highway at Lebec, Officer Jim Biehl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck did not turn over and the driver, Mohammad Khan, 24, of Ridge Grove, 
was not injured. Biehl said at least 20 of the bags of sulfur began to burn or 
smolder, sending a white cloud about 200 feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
As the sulfur cloud continued to grow, the CHP closed the southbound lanes of 
the freeway at 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the CHP could not say when the freeway would be opened.

Evangelist Morris Cerullo, once a guest on imprisoned television preacher Jim

Organized refugee smugglers have found a way to smuggle Vietnamese boat people 
into Thailand by sailing them toward U.S. warships heading for Thai ports, an 
Interior Ministry spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Pathai Wichanpreecha said the ministry has observed that the 
smugglers take Vietnamese refugees out to sea when U.S. Navy vessels are 
scheduled to call on Thai ports. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to know in advance when the American warships planned to visit 
Thailand so they could bring Vietnamese boat people out to the vessels," the 
spokesman said. "The sea is so wide, they should not have met the warships so 
often." 
</P>
<P>
He said five U.S. warships have picked up 286 Vietnamese refugees at sea on 
their way to Thailand since last June.

Under the "expanded access" plan, dideoxycytidine, or DDC, will be distributed 
free to people with AIDS or AIDS-related complex who cannot take the two 
currently available drugs to attack the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Those drugs are AZT, the only fully approved AIDS-fighting drug, and DDI, an 
experimental drug already offered through an expanded access program. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone involved with finding treatments for AIDS recognizes the critical 
need to provide an option for those individuals who cannot tolerate the 
currently available treatments," said Dr. Waijen Soo of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 
which makes DDC. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann-La Roche officials estimated that up to 1,000 AIDS patients may 
qualify for the expanded DDC distribution program, scheduled to begin June 25. 
Patients will only be able to obtain the drug after their doctors contact the 
drug company. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Kmetik, a spokeswoman for Hoffmann-La Roche in Nutley, N.J., emphasized 
that the safety and effectiveness of DDC are still being tested. But she said 
preliminary results indicate that the drug does not produce the severe anemia 
that is frequently seen in patients taking AZT, nor does it appear to cause the 
inflammation of the pancreas that has been associated with DDI. 
</P>
<P>
Both DDC and DDI can trigger a nerve disorder that causes pain in the feet and 
hands. But Kmetik said that problem seems to have been reduced for DDC since 
researchers cut the dose they were giving patients.

A court today charged a high-ranking reserve officer and a company he heads 
with illegally providing military expertise and equipment to a group of 
civilians in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Lt. Col. Yair Klein, is also wanted in Colombia for allegedly 
helping to train fighters for cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
The case involving Klein and his Hod Hahanit, or "spearhead" company, has 
prompted wide debate in Israel over the practice of retired military officers 
working as mercenaries overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Klein's company is defined in the charges as an organization that trains and 
builds counterterrorist fighting squads. 
</P>
<P>
The four-page charge sheet makes no mention of the Colombian charges that Klein 
was involved in training assassination teams for the Medellin drug cartel. 
Klein has vigorously denied such allegations.

The president of the University of South Carolina has resigned after weeks of 
criticism about lavish spending on fund-raising trips and hiring of celebrities 
as visiting teachers, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
James B. Holderman, 54, who has headed the 40,000-student state university 
since 1977, will step down July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Holderman made no reference to the controversy when he announced his 
resignation Wednesday, and declined to answer reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
Holderman regularly used luxury hotels while on fund-raising trips; hired 
$35-an-hour chauffeured limousine services in Washington, and frequently 
chartered jets or flew first class, records showed. 
</P>
<P>
Jihan Sadat, widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, was paid $200,000 to 
teach a course in Egyptian culture for three semesters in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the school has drawn criticism for paying actor-director Robby 
Benson $158,367 to teach filmmaking and $15,600 for rent, with Holderman 
kicking in $10,000 from his discretionary fund for travel and moving expenses.

U.S. REJECTS FLA. CALL FOR TOTAL CALIFORNIA MEDFLY QUARANTINE

Turning down Florida's suggestion that all of California be quarantined to 
combat the Medfly outbreak, the Agriculture Department said today that it has 
no immediate plans to expand the quarantine beyond Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel our quarantine procedure and the area that is quarantined are adequate 
at this point to prevent the spread of Medflies," said USDA spokesman Larry 
Mark. 
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was made Wednesday after the National Plant Board Advisory 
Council, meeting here, recommended no change for at least 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner last week urged the department to 
order the entire state of California under quarantine to fight the Medfly, one 
of the world's most destructive pests. 
</P>
<P>
The worst outbreak was a decade ago in the area south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
USDA enlarged the quarantine area May 8 to include parts of Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. A Medfly quarantine also is in 
effect for part of the Miami Springs-Hialeah area of south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly attacks more than 200 varieties of fruits and vegetables, and citrus 
is especially vulnerable, with losses of 25% to 50% of production likely in 
cases of severe infestation.

Westinghouse Electric Corp. said today it will launch a buyback program to 
repurchase up to 20 million shares of the company's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman John Marous said the purchases will be made through open-market or 
private transactions at prices the company considers appropriate over the next 
12 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Marous said Westinghouse stock is currently an attractive investment and the 
buyback is in keeping with the company's strategy to enhance shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse was listed at $35.25 in early morning trading on the New York

He said that the 12-count federal grand jury indictment was the first federal

That's what most people call it anyway. Now, Michigan Bell is changing the name

When the service began shortly after the turn of the century, it was called 
Information. In 1967, it was changed to Directory Assistance. In 1971, the name 
was changed to New Number Information. A decade later, it returned to Directory 
Assistance.

The return to Information completes the circle, Eileen Dixon, a Michigan Bell

NEW MASON SHOW IS LIKE THE OLD MASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackie Mason set himself a tall order when, in "Jackie Mason Brand New," which 
opened Wednesday at the Henry Fonda Theater, he promised a show that would 
consist of completely new material. With the exception of a solitary joke 
having to do with guarding your health while your grandfather steals your 
money, he's succeeded, even if it's deja vu all over again. 
</P>
<P>
It's good to see that he's back strong after his "Chicken Soup" TV debacle, and 
that he's even chosen Hollywood, which forgives everything except failure, as 
his comeback site. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which a comedy boom billows out of the collective energy of 
self-satisfied amateurs whose shallow efforts are bent on parlaying 20 minutes 
of material into a show-biz career, Mason plays well by contrast. His timing is 
incomparable. His jokes are delivered with the utmost economy, and he knows how 
to cluster them around themes that often develop like cadenzas. And he has of 
course that old-fashioned Brooklyn Jewish persona that's as thick and 
distinctive as borscht. What the jokes are about, though, is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Wolfe has a passage in one of his novels about a character who can't 
help but utter cliches every time he opens his mouth. Even when he thinks he 
has an original thought, and even when he says something that's true or of 
merit, it sounds stale. That's one of the problems with Mason. He's struggling 
for freshness, and sometimes you're with him, as when he does a number on 
George Bush's militant effort to annihilate the wimp factor (Bush to Gorbachev: 
"You better not come here with broccoli!"). 
</P>
<P>
Still, he falls into his old drumbeat in which Jews squabble their inept lives 
away with sour envy, price-tag mania and nouveau riche affectation; gentiles 
are eminently practical ("Jewish ingenuity stopped in 1874. That's when 
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, and the Jew realized he could 
call a gentile to do the job"), and marriage is a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Mason thinks he's bearing the comedic burden of telling us the truth when, in 
fact, he's relating the narrow perspective of the self-described Brooklyn Jew, 
memorably pungent in small doses, but not something that describes a world of 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
A complete review runs in Friday's Calendar section.

Australian rock band Midnight Oil took their music and environment theme to the 
streets, performing amid the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan for a lunchtime 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a mega-crisis on our hands that we all have to approach," lead 
singer Peter Garrett said after Wednesday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a crisis that our leaders, corporations and governments have a prime 
responsibility to address seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The band is on a U.S. tour to promote their new album, "Blue Sky Mining." 
</P>
<P>
Although they have been performing for 10 years, their U.S. breakthrough wasn't 
until 1987 with their hit song "Beds Are Burning" from their album "Diesel and 
Dust." 
</P>
<P>
Their songs concentrate on the ecosystem, world peace and corporate greed. At 
the invitation of Midnight Oil, the environmental group Greenpeace sets up 
information tables at each concert. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is also an attorney and president of the Australian Conservation 
Foundation, the country's leading advisory board on problems of national 
heritage and environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just do a one-day Earth Day," Garrett said.

ALIENATED 'ALIEN NATION' SEEKS VIEWER SUPPORT

Fox Broadcasting has zapped "Alien Nation" and the Newcomers are not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
They want viewers who enjoyed the show to write to Fox demanding its return -- 
a ploy that revived "Cagney &amp; Lacy" on CBS but has not worked for other 
shows. It did not even beam "Star Trek" back aboard NBC years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Alien Nation," for those who don't know a Newcomer from an Overseer, uses the 
premise of alien refugees from outer space settling in Los Angeles to focus on 
a wide range of human institutions and peculiarities. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a cop show, teaming a human and an alien as police partners. Michele 
Scarabelli plays Susan Francisco, the wife of alien cop George Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in shock," Scarabelli said in an interview after learning the bad news 
when Fox announced its new fall schedule Tuesday and "Alien Nation" was absent. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the Friday before the announcement they were telling us how much they 
liked the show and how excited they were about the upcoming season," she said. 
"Then on Friday they told (producer) Ken Johnson that they were trying to find 
a place for us on the new fall schedule. Then late Monday they told him they 
couldn't find a place on the schedule. How's that for the lame excuse of the 
week award? 
</P>
<P>
"We're all kind of reeling. We believed we had a hit and now we're realizing 
there are no guarantees," Scarabelli said. "Most of us feel we had stories 
still to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Scarabelli talked about the encouraging critical reaction to the series -- she 
liked the television critic who said he felt closer to the Newcomers than to 
his family in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people should let the network know that there is a following for the 
show; that they shouldn't rely completely on the Nielsen ratings, which is a 
false barometer anyway, especially for Fox."

CINEPLEX VEXES MOVIEGOERS WITH PRICE HIKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon Theatres in Los Angeles has raised its ticket prices to $7.50 
and ushers may have to ask for combat pay because moviegoers aren't happy about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The financially troubled chain said that increased expenses forced the 50-cent 
hike, which began two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new price has arrived just as patrons are rushing to see summer releases. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of the people complain. Some of them get angry and ask to see 
the manager," said Victor Hahn, who works in the ticket window at the Cineplex 
in Universal City. "I'm sure the manager can tell you some pretty unique 
stories about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's manager declined to share any war stories. Patrons, however, were quick 
to speak up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm astounded," said Marlene Halsey, who was visiting from Oregon and wanted 
to see "Back to the Future Part III." "Where I come from, it's still $5 to go 
to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Other theater chains, which still charge between $5 and $7 in major cities, 
said they had no plans to increase ticket prices this summer. 
</P>
<P>
At Cineplex's Universal City and Century City theaters, customers pay the 
highest price in town and an additional $2.50 to $3 for parking, making an 
evening at the cinema nearly as expensive as box seats at a Dodger game.

Any doubt that Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi mixes with the rich and famous 
was dispelled Wednesday when one of his personal phone books was admitted into 
evidence at his fraud trial. 
</P>
<P>
Entries in the loose-leaf book included politicians, entertainers, athletes, 
business figures and apparently Leona Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
Among the politicians: former Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter; 
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger; and Robert C. McFarlane, the 
former national security adviser under President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Actors and entertainers included Christopher Reeve, Farrah Fawcett, Liza 
Minnelli, Paul Anka, Wayne Newton and Brooke Shields. Also listed was George 
Hamilton, a close friend of Khashoggi's co-defendant, Imelda Marcos, who 
earlier testified at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The book also held phone numbers for Muhammad Ali, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. 
Iaccoca and a "Mrs. Helmsely," an apparent reference to hotel queen Leona 
Helmsley, who was convicted of tax evasion last year in the same Manhattan 
federal courtroom where Khashoggi and Mrs. Marcos are being tried.

A state appeals court has cleared the way for the remains of circus magnate 
John Ringling and his wife, Mabel, to be buried on the grounds of the Sarasota 
art museum that bears their name. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd District Court of Appeal in Lakeland upheld an order Wednesday that was 
made last year by Sarasota Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan allowing the burials. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we're prepared to move forward with the appropriate memorial," said 
lawyer Lamar Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews represents John Ringling's nephew, Henry Ringling North, in his quest 
to have the couple buried at the museum alongside John Ringling's sister, Ida 
North. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Buck, a grandniece of Ringling, had opposed burying Ida North with the 
Ringlings because Ida had nothing to do with the circus. Henry North had the 
Ringlings' bodies moved in 1987 from receiving vaults in Fairview, N.J., to 
unmarked crypts at a Port Charlotte cemetery. Mabel Ringling died in 1929 and 
John died in 1936. Ida North's body has been stored at a Sarasota funeral home 
since her death in 1950.

<P>
Comic Jay Leno will donate royalties from his book "Headlines" to a charity 
that helps children stricken with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"My manager had a 3-year-old baby that died of AIDS and at the time people 
thought it couldn't happen to them," Leno said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Profits from the book, a collection of wacky newspaper headlines that has sold 
more than 250,000 copies, will go to the Samuel Jared Kushnick Foundation, 
founded by his manager, Helen Kushnick. Leno said he does not know how much 
money is involved. 
</P>
<P>
Kushnick's son died in 1983 after receiving an AIDS-tainted blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
She said Leno's effort "makes me feel Sam didn't die in vain."

Michel Bergeron was fired today as coach of the Quebec Nordiques, the NHL's 
worst team last season. 
</P>
<P>
No replacement was named, but Dave Chambers, a former assistant coach with the 
Minnesota North Stars, is considered the leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Pierre Page said Bergeron was offered a job as a broadcaster 
for Nordiques games, and that the fours years left on his contract would be 
honored -- at approximately $250,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not blaming Michel Bergeron," said Page, adding that he was uneasy 
making the decision since he has been general manager only a month. "It's just 
a question of the right time, the right place and the right people." 
</P>
<P>
The team finished last in the overall standings last season with a 12-61-7 
record.

WORLD CUP REFEREES TO ENFORCE NEW GUIDELINES ON ROUGH PLAY

Referees are in as much danger of getting a red card at the World Cup finals as 
the players, under FIFA's tough new guidelines to stamp out rough play. 
</P>
<P>
International Football Federation President Joao Havelange said today that a 
referee who failed to send off players for violent offenses would immediately 
be sent home himself. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament's 36 referees also face stringent physical fitness tests June 4 
and those who fail will be thrown out of the World Cup, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"If we finish the tournament with no referees left, I will blow the whistle at 
the final myself," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, I don't think we will have a problem. If some referees who come 
expecting to officiate at two matches, do four instead, then why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Havelange, backing the most determined attempt ever made by FIFA to clean up 
soccer, said referees could seriously damage the game by failing to interpret 
the laws correctly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be severe with our referees this time," he said in an apparent 
reference to widespread criticism of the low standard of refereeing at the 1986 
World Cup finals in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"People go to the World Cup to see good matches. The referees are the ones who 
can stop rough play," Havelange added. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA held an unprecedented course in March for World Cup referees. They want 
tough action from the men in black and a consistent interpretation of the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Under FIFA's guidelines, players who tackle from behind or use 
"disproportionate or unnecessary strength" when committing a foul must be 
instantly ejected, as must those who assault or insult a referee.

BELMONT FIELD CONTINUES TO SHRINK; 
</P>
<P>
TRIPLE CROWN: DOTSERO, WINNER OF THE ILLINOIS DERBY, WON'T MAKE IT TO THE 
STARTING GATE. MISTER FRISKY AND REAL CASH ALSO ARE OUT.

<P>
The Belmont Stakes is more than a week away, and the Triple Crown finale's 
already threadbare ranks are beginning to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Derby winner Dotsero, a questionable commodity even under ideal 
circumstances, is the latest defection. 
</P>
<P>
He worked at Arlington Park on Wednesday and was to have been flown to Belmont 
if the exercise was satisfactory. It was, but trainer Tim Muckler and the 
colt's owners elected afterward to pass up the Belmont trip. Muckler said 
running Dotsero in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont without a prep "might be a little 
anxious." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remarkably disappointing Mister Frisky, who has taken ill, will 
not have the opportunity to tire badly in all three Triple Crown cities after 
having won 16 consecutive races in Puerto Rico and California. The Puerto Rican 
champion has been ill since arriving at Belmont Park after the Preakness, 
assistant trainer Albert Barrera said Wednesday, and has not set a hoof on a 
race track since May 19, when he was a distant third at Pimlico. Mister Frisky 
will be returned to California as soon as he is well enough to travel. 
</P>
<P>
The D. Wayne Lukas Stable has withdrawn Real Cash, unplaced in the Kentucky 
Derby and third in the Jersey Derby, from consideration for the Belmont, but 
confirmed that Land Rush, unplaced in both the Derby and Preakness, will keep 
the date. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on the Belmont status of Gotham and Wood Memorial winner Thirty Six 
Red, who has not started since finishing ninth in the Kentucky Derby, will be 
made by trainer Nick Zito and owner B. Giles Brophy after a scheduled workout 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"If he works the way we want him to," Zito said, "we'll proceed to the Belmont. 
I think he's back to 100%. I have no doubt that if he's the way I think he is, 
we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness runner-up Unbridled, who is assured of a 
$1-million bonus simply by starting and finishing the Belmont, emerged without 
incident from a six-furlong move in 1:14 1/5 over a wet track Tuesday at 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
The first two finishers in the Jersey Derby as well as the third finisher in 
the Peter Pan Stakes are also on course for the Belmont. Yonder, the Jersey 
Derby winner, has the Belmont penciled in for June 9, according to trainer 
Angel Penna. Video Ranger, fourth in the Kentucky Derby before losing a narrow 
decision to Yonder at Garden State, is at Belmont and will gallop up to the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Country Day's trainer, John Parisella, confirmed his Belmont status. "I can't 
wait," he said.

INNOVATION: A NEW PRISM ON GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zero false modesty, and no apologies to Adam Smith from Michael Porter. The 
Harvard Business School guru's unself-consciously titled "The Competitive 
Advantage of Nations" may glitter with global analyses, but it really burns 
with ambition. No fewer than 10 countries and a dozen industries are 
spectroanalyzed through Porter's prism of competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Exhaustive, exhausting and thick enough to choke a python, "Nations" does at 
least one thing exceedingly well: It reveals just how empty and shallow the 
current debates about competitiveness really are. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over capital gains and foreign exchange rates, Japan, venture 
capital, education, antitrust policy and government subsidies are all secondary 
or even tertiary issues. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't meaningful outside the context of a fuller understanding of how a 
nation -- not just an industry -- builds competitive advantage in an 
increasingly global economic marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened is that the competitiveness debate has been seized by special 
interests, each shrieking that their particular sliver is the key to unlocking 
the problem of competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
What Porter's book does is identify these special interests for what they 
really are -- fragments of a far more complex and important dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Smith skewered the mercantilists of his day, Porter -- whose texts on 
strategy have become cult classics for business groupies -- wants to shred the 
conventional wisdoms encrusting global competition, industrial policy and free 
markets and serve up his own feast of insights for policy makers and business 
types to chew on. 
</P>
<P>
Where Joseph Schumpeter described "creative destruction," Porter offers up 
corporate "clusters" of expertise and complementary skills that shape the 
domestic dynamics of innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Where David Ricardo spoke of labor differentials as the key to comparative 
advantage, Porter has "factor conditions" -- such as education and training -- 
that address human capital investments. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Porter presents what he calls the national "diamond" of forces -- 
factor conditions, clusters, the nature of domestic demand (smart customers 
tend to get innovative products; dull customers get dull products) and the 
strategies and structures of rival firms -- as his model and metaphor to 
capture the ingredients of national economic advantage. 
</P>
<P>
These forces are the minimum daily requirements for global competitiveness. 
Without a healthy interplay between these forces, pious proclamations for tax 
breaks and subsidy are a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
Porter is nothing if not an articulate apostle of innovation. He inextricably 
links the quality of national competitive advantage to the quality of 
technological and organizational innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Porter's book suffers because, when push comes to shove, he is an academic, not 
a polemicist -- and a book drained of passion is more a set of ideas than an 
engaging experience. Adam Smith rhapsodized about marketplaces and individual 
initiative; Porter lugs out and dissects a 10-country database before your 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
This is less a book than a compendium. Nevertheless, if you want a powerful new 
vocabulary to describe what competitiveness means or where innovation really 
comes from, Porter's lexicon-cum-atlas is the best one on the (global) market 
today. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, there seems to be nothing new in Porter's analytics. But look 
deeper and what you find is an intriguing, even rigorous, diagnostic tool to 
measure how well a domestic industry can hope to do in an increasingly 
competitive global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The examples from Italy's fluid and ultracompetitive tile industry and 
Germany's quality-driven printing press manufacturers are nothing short of 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
They reveal a web of formal practice and informal relationships -- such as the 
dozens of high-tech family shops in an Italian village designing tiles -- that 
go far beyond any single industry or government incentive. The diamond becomes 
a lens that provides a different perspective on the apparently obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Porter dismisses the romantic illusion that entrepreneurial visionaries spring 
full-blown into the global marketplace, like Athena from the head of Zeus. He 
convincingly argues that if these national diamonds don't exist, these 
entrepreneurs are likelier to end up Don Quixotes than Henry Fords. 
</P>
<P>
More ominously, the erosion of even one point of the diamond -- say, the 
sophistication of the domestic market -- can suck the competitiveness out of 
even the most technically gifted competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Porter's work is as much borne of frustration as intellectual curiosity. Back 
in 1984, Porter was a Harvard hotshot named by Ronald Reagan to serve on The 
President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
That group, chaired by Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive John A. Young, was 
launched with great fanfare and quickly became a Washington laughingstock -- 
not because it was a bunch of boobs but because the idea of competitiveness 
became politicized into 'industrial policy' and there was no way the Reagan 
Administration was going to sully its hands with anything that remotely smacked 
of interventionism. 
</P>
<P>
No Rose Garden reception here, but a bum's rush "Thank you so much for your 
report, gosh, look at the time, got to run" meeting with then-Commerce 
Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. It was humiliating. 
</P>
<P>
"I was incredulous," Porter recalls. "I was so annoyed at how ineffective we'd 
been . . . there was a fundamental lack of understanding of what 
competitiveness meant . . ." and that led directly to this book. 
</P>
<P>
However, you only hear the frustration and irony when you actually listen to 
Porter talk instead of read his glacial prose. The interpersonal Porter 
provides all the passion his book lacks. 
</P>
<P>
Both governments and executive committees misunderstand the new dynamics of 
globalism, Porter asserts. "There's a paradox," he says. "The reality is that 
even in global markets, domestic rivalry is still important. The notion that we 
need consolidation by mergers and acquisitions is flawed. We're taking this 
notion of risk-reduction much too far. We're fixated with static efficiency 
when progressiveness and innovation are far more important." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Porter is a fan of policies that promote competition and more 
competition. He's also a fan of programs that encourage companies to invest in 
new technology. "Look at how Japan has encouraged the distribution of robotics 
technologies by helping set up leasing companies," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for algorithms and recipes for global competitiveness, you 
shouldn't bother with "Nations" -- you're better off with the reviews. 
</P>
<P>
But managers, entrepreneurs and technocrats in state capitals such as 
Sacramento, Albany and Boston might discover some useful techniques and models 
to evaluate their own clusters and subcultures of innovation. Porter has 
succeeded in writing a significant book. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are that he's failed to write an important book. Significant books 
change how people view the world; important books do more -- they change how 
people feel about the world. Adam Smith did that. Michael Porter could have, 
had he written with the same intensity with which he speaks.

MALAYSIAN EX-LEADER HUSSEIN BIN ONN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hussein Bin Onn, prime minister of Malaysia from 1976 to 1981, died Monday at a 
California hospital after suffering a heart attack. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein died at Seton Medical Center in Daly City near San Francisco. He had 
undergone triple heart bypass surgery there April 14 and was readmitted for 
additional heart and gall bladder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A heart operation in 1981 had forced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was Malaysia's third prime minister after the country gained 
independence from Britain in 1957. He became prime minister after the death of 
Abdul Razak in 1976. Hussein had been Abdul Razak's deputy and his 
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was a member of the United Malays National Organization Party, which 
has ruled the country since independence in a coalition with Chinese and Indian 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein selected the present prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, to succeed him 
in 1981. But the two broke with each other in 1987-88 when Mahathir sacked 
Malaysia's highest-ranking judge, arrested 106 people and detained them without 
trial. Mahathir's actions resulted in formation of a rival party. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 months, Mahathir and Hussein were said to have reconciled 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's son-in-law, Yahya Awang, said the Malaysian Embassy was making 
arrangements for the body to be flown back to the Southeast Asia nation where 
an official funeral is planned.
