A FILOFAX PHOBIC ASKS: IS THE UNSCHEDULED LIFE WORTH LIVING?

<TEXT>
<P>
I'M THINKING ABOUT converting. I realize that it's a really big step, but I've 
talked to people who have made it. And they assure me that my life will improve 
dramatically. I'll be a better person -- more confident, more creative and more 
effective. All I have to do is surrender my life to a higher power, to the Good 
Book -- the Personal Organizer. 
</P>
<P>
I know it's a little late. For years, millions of Americans have worshiped 
patented, refillable loose-leaf notebooks. But these three-ring oracles make me 
nervous. They tell you where to go and what to do -- minute by minute -- for 
the next week, month, year or decade, depending on the model. And there are as 
many models as . . . well . . . denominations, all promising to fulfill your 
every need. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my bible," exclaims Kay, a stockbroker who swears by her brown leather 
Running Mate. "It's with me all the time. I can't move without it." Frankly, 
I'm amazed that she can move with it. The yuppie equivalent to Linus' blanket 
must weigh a ton. 
</P>
<P>
"I write my theater schedule in it and my notes on paying bills," Kay says, 
"and when the kids go to their father and their Scout activities and their 
doctor's appointments. And my appointments. And lists of things to do each 
day." Just listening to her makes me feel slothful. "If I ever lost it, I would 
die," she says. "I wouldn't know how I could reschedule my life." 
</P>
<P>
Many people think that the unscheduled life is not worth living. These 
never-a-dull-moment types find it comforting to open their Day-Timers, 
Filofaxes, Write Tracks and other gospels to the "Today" page and see that 
every 15-minute slot is filled with Places to Go, People to Contact and Things 
to Do or Buy. (Stuck with a void, they can always write down "check the book" 
or "update the book.") 
</P>
<P>
Once, organizers were the exclusive property of bill-by-the-minute 
professionals. But now CNN reports that they're a $200- to $300-million-a-year 
industry. Even elementary school students can make sure that they don't miss 
the big Duck, Duck, Goose game or the power ice cream and cookie networking 
session with a Dinky Diary Organizer from Day Runner. (Oh dear.) 
</P>
<P>
Secretly, I would love to be a hyper-efficient automaton who never forgets 
birthdays or holidays, who can find a receipt without turning the house upside 
down. But I have a weakness for spontaneity. I want to be able to call my 
friends without making a note in my Communication Log. 
</P>
<P>
"You do have free will," says my friend Marjorie, a Pocket Day-Timer disciple. 
"You don't have to do everything the book says." She tells me that with her 
system you carry only one month at a time, "so you can't lose your identity." 
</P>
<P>
I want to believe her. But many people are slaves to their systems. "It makes 
me more efficient," says Lenny Fagelman, owner of the Filofax department at 
Fred Segal Melrose. Fagelman, who says, "I don't use my organizer to drive to 
work," strives for order the way gurus strive for inner peace. He stocks more 
than 400 Filofax components, including inserts for keeping snooker records. 
"It's all function," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
I'm ashamed to admit that for years I've been functioning with just a 
disarranged Rolodex and a calendar that is usually chosen because it has pretty 
pictures, not vital information. I make notes in a cheap little notebook that 
doesn't even have a movable plastic "Today" marker. Or worse, I resort to the 
Scrap System and jot important details on a used envelope or -- if I want to 
feel in control -- a Post-it Note. 
</P>
<P>
I sometimes suspect that the real appeal of the Good Book is that it gives baby 
boomers a chance to reconnect with the wonder years, when our biggest decision 
was whether to carry a loose-leaf notebook emblazoned with Fred Flintstone or 
Mr. Spock. But nowadays, though most binders still come with the clear-plastic 
pencil case, our choices are far more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I could have been organized months ago, but I can't make up my mind. 
Should the book be as big as a briefcase or as small as a pocket calculator? (I 
can also set up shop on a hard or floppy disk, though it would be a pain to 
turn on the computer whenever I need a phone number.) And my choices go on and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Do I want a calendar that has a page per day, two pages per day, a page per 
week, per month, per millennium? Who cares? And then there's the really big 
question -- what should my organizer be made of? Catalina vinyl? (It's hard to 
make a commitment to a material I can't identify.) Cowhide? Lamb? Shark? 
Definitely not alligator, which sells for $1,900. 
</P>
<P>
"My Filofax is reindeer," Fagelman says. Oh no, not Rudolph. "It's a limited 
edition," he says. "They recovered the hides from a 200-year-old German 
shipwreck." 
</P>
<P>
I'm no longer thinking about converting.

OUTTAKES: DOUBLE DOORS

When Oliver Stone's "The Doors" wraps late this month, Val Kilmer may not be 
turning in the black leather pants he wears as lead singer Jim Morrison. The 
reason: Kilmer and the rest of the "group" may reprise their roles -- as 
supporting characters -- if "Wild Child" (formerly "Wonderland Avenue") begins 
filming this summer. 
</P>
<P>
That's the word from a source close to "Wild Child," which details a young 
man's coming-of-age in the frenzied rock world. Stone, executive producer of 
"Wild Child" for Carolco Pictures, didn't want to comment on the double 
casting. "He feels it's too premature. They haven't even signed a director," 
says a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
But we're tipped that shooting is expected to begin when "The Doors" wraps, 
with Doors "members" Kilmer, Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillon and Frank Whaley -- 
and Meg Ryan (who plays Morrison's common-law wife) -- back in character. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Desmond Nakano, "Wild Child" is based on the autobiographical tome 
by Danny Sugerman, who was 13 when he began hanging out at the Doors' L.A. 
office. Pat H. Broeske

Ishi, the last aboriginal Indian in North America, who became an 
anthropological wonder when discovered in 1911, will be the subject of a 
feature film and a PBS documentary -- both projects funded by the National 
Endowment for the Humanities. Berkeley-based filmmaker Jed Riffe hopes to begin 
his unusual double filming late this year, with writer-director Avery Crounse 
adapting Theodora Kroeber's book, "Ishi, the Last Yahi." 
</P>
<P>
A television movie, "Ishi, the Last of His Tribe," aired in 1979 on NBC, and 
another Kroeber book, "Ishi in Two Worlds," has been previously announced as a 
film project, but never made. Riffe tells us Crounse has done "extensive 
original research" beyond existing material that will shed new light on Ishi's 
remarkable life. 
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged Ishi had lived undetected by whites until he was encountered 
near Oroville, Calif., in 1911, the last survivor of his tribe. Until his death 
from tuberculosis five years later, he lived in San Francisco's Museum of 
Anthropology, where thousands lined up to see him as he devoted his last years 
to passing on his tribe's history. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his strange situation, Riffe says, "Ishi never lost his own sense of 
self, his uniqueness. Even though he lived in a museum, he maintained his 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"His is a story of someone who lost everything, but never lost himself." John

OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF . . . PATRICK WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Helen Berg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Patrick Wayne was born with good looks and a priceless surname, but the 
son of the "Duke" -- the late and legendary John Wayne -- has never been 
box-office gold. He's made a "decent living" since debuting with his father in 
John Ford's "Rio Grande" (1950), the actor says, but leading roles have been 
elusive, particularly with the demise of the traditional Western as a screen 
staple. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne's about to gain renewed visibility as the host of the third incarnation 
of "Tic Tac Dough," a game show from Barry &amp; Enright that re-appears in 
September (locally on KCOP Channel 13). The original ran on NBC in 1957 and 
1958 and was syndicated from 1978 to 1986. The new "Tic Tac Dough" has so far 
been sold to 60 markets, says producer Chris Sohl. 
</P>
<P>
Now 50, and with 40 years in the business, Wayne says he's "walked a wire," 
trying to preserve a private life and promote his career. "I haven't made a 
complete success of either, to be honest with you -- of avoiding (publicity) or 
being a success in the business," he says, adding that his fear of living in a 
"fishbowl" may have kept him from aggressively pursuing more roles. "My 
father's private life was virtually non-existent. I think that's something that 
affects me on an absolutely subconscious level." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Wayne has taken mostly small roles in features, television guest spots 
and commercials. This spring, he played a romantic role in six episodes of 
ABC's daytime soap "All My Children." 
</P>
<P>
But his favorite genres are Westerns and action-adventures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very cyclic business," Wayne says. "I just hope I'm around when they 
start making Westerns again." Mary Helen Berg

WHERE EAST MEETS WEST

I'M SO ADDICTED to Asia and Asian food that I succumb to mild depression on the 
return flight from a trip to the Orient. But I've found a way to alleviate the 
melancholy: I take a long walk through downtown L.A.'s Chinatown. The strong, 
sweet fragrances of the displays are the same scents that permeate Singapore's 
Chinatown. It's the next best thing to being in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Ren Tea Co. (811 N. Broadway), is a branch of a Taipei shop where I buy 
tea. And Bangkok seemed a little closer when I spotted frozen seafood shipped 
in by a company on Soi Langsuan, a street in Bangkok known for its great eating 
places. Besides atmosphere, in Chinatown I find practical buys not available in 
markets elsewhere, such as boneless cuts of pork particularly well-suited for 
the preparation of Chinese dishes. The 99 Ranch Market (in the Bamboo Plaza at 
the north end of Hill Street) sells meat cut in tiny cubes or strips for 
stir-frying, as well as paper-thin slices of lamb. The vegetables here are so 
clearly labeled that you'll quickly learn the difference between gai lan 
(Chinese kale) and bok choy. Ai Hoa Market (860 N. Hill St.) stocks interesting 
produce, including the soapy-tasting laksa leaf, which is used in a Singaporean 
dish of noodles with a curry-coconut broth. The items are labeled in three 
languages -- Vietnamese, Chinese and English. . And I often wind up at the 
area's only Thai store, the Los Angeles Supermarket (675 N. Spring St.), which 
carries jasmine rice, curry pastes, lemon grass, among other essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown is a Pan-Asian bazaar, presenting not just Chinese foods but 
Indonesian candlenuts, Korean kimchi, Filipino seasonings. Recently, I even saw 
fresh durian, the notoriously strong-smelling, spiny Asian fruit, which brought 
back memories of an afternoon in Malaysia, munching the fruit along the 
roadside. The flavor was magnificent, like mellow custard laced with fine 
brandy. BARBARA HANSEN

ARROGANT, PRECISE, keen-witted -- that was Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes. 
The movies he and Nigel Bruce (as Dr. Watson) made in the '40s are classics. 
</P>
<P>
But did you know they also had a radio show during World War II? These 
wonderful original radio broadcasts -- a great antidote for the commuter blahs 
-- have recently been issued on audio cassette (about $10 each). 
</P>
<P>
In "The Iron Box," Holmes and Watson are entrained for Edinburgh on The Flying 
Scotsman when Holmes reveals that they are traveling at 53 1/2 miles per hour. 
How does he know that? Elementary, my dear Watson. You take your watch and . . 
. well, you'll have to tune in to find out. There are more than 20 of these 
radio shows now out on audio cassettes (two adventures per tape). 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are available from Simon &amp; Schuster Audioworks; (800) 678-2677.

FOR GOOD MEASURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every once in a while somebody like Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando or Delta 
Burke gets fat. Instantly a mass discussion ensues regarding the rights of fat 
people to exist, wear certain types of clothing, eat in public, have sex lives, 
enjoy ice cream or be on television. 
</P>
<P>
While in the short term this may make thin people feel better by allowing them 
to forget their own frailties, in the long run it is damaging to all of us. 
None of us is physically perfect, and that rare person who is will invariably 
become "imperfect" with age. Rather than being hypercritical of ourselves and 
others, we should enjoy the diversity that gives us our breadth and richness. 
</P>
<P>
"For Good Measure," by Paddy Calistro (Looks, April 8), is, I think, a good 
example of our mentality. Now, it seems, the flavor of the month is very large 
breasts. Normal, healthy women with average or slightly smaller-than-average 
breasts are subjecting themselves to the risks of an operative procedure so 
that they can look like some busty model (who may also have had breast 
augmentations). What will women with large breasts do when flat-chested models 
come back in vogue? The irony of all of this is that thin women tend to have 
smaller breasts. Let's be happy with ourselves and accepting of others. Sooner 
or later your height, weight, hair color, breast size or age will be in vogue.

ROSE BOWL GLIDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANEY MILSTEAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN THE WINDS get going, they blow some eagerly anticipated thermals into 
Pasadena, which in turn lure glider pilots out of the hills and onto the grassy 
area between the Rose Bowl and Brookside Park. Weather conditions in June make 
it a big month for radio-controlled craft. 
</P>
<P>
And glider flying can be as much fun for spectators as it is for participants; 
there are often numerous planes in flight simultaneously, creating a colorful, 
impromptu air show. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping one of these radio-controlled gliders (many of which have 6-to-8-foot 
wingspans) aloft and landing it safely is no small accomplishment. Generally 
made of spruce, balsa or fiberglass, gliders range in weight from 12 ounces to 
2 pounds. Their light weight makes them highly maneuverable, as well as 
vulnerable to every air current. "You just have to wait for the lifts and pay 
attention," says Bart Hibbs, a Rose Bowl flyer who began building his own 
planes from scratch 20 years ago and now as an aerospace engineer designs 
aircraft at AeroVironment, the company that developed the new back-pack plane 
for the Marine Corps (the 9-pound motorized craft has a 9-foot wingspan and can 
scout a 5-mile area via video camera). 
</P>
<P>
For those who need some help getting started, glider kits are available 
(selling from $35 to $200) at most hobby centers (radios are sold separately). 
A.R.F. (Almost Ready to Fly) gliders, which require just a few finishing 
touches, can be purchased for about $150 at the Hobby Place in West L.A. 
(213-836-2000). Flying at the Rose Bowl location is limited to days when there 
are no events scheduled at the stadium, so check timetables prior to takeoff.

THIS JUST MIGHT be the best transportation bargain around. Far more scenic than 
a ride on the RTD, and much less crazy-making than getting a cab, it's the 
ferry ride between Balboa peninsula and Balboa Island. 
</P>
<P>
On the four-minute crossing, riders are treated to a stunning panorama of the 
Balboa waterfront. The Balboa Island Ferry runs daily, and tickets cost 65 
cents for car and driver, 25 cents for adults and 10 cents for kids.

island; (714) 673-1070. ROBIN TUCKER

Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. And those who can do absolutely 
nothing, do research. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I'm overstating my case, but newspaper readers can't help but observe we 
are in the midst of a research glut of hideous proportions. Since 1970, the 
number of scientific journals in the United States has doubled to more than 
5,000. That's one megachunk of research per every 100 people in a city the size 
of Stuttgart! 
</P>
<P>
What is the point of this information avalanche, other than to increase the 
income of professors who already have one free ride? 
</P>
<P>
I know we need some research. I understand that without research I would not 
enjoy many of the things I take for granted, such as lite ice cream and no 
cholera. I understand that without research the ranks of the homeless would be 
swollen with sociologists, sexologists and behavioral psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely, one sees a well-done study. More often, the research seems to exist for 
no other reason than to get reported on in the press and commented on by 
commentators. One even suspects that university types are under pressure to get 
publicity. If Fred gets his study on "Humor and Endorphin Production" mentioned 
in the paper, then Bill must get his work on "Body Odor and Sexual Frequency" 
on the evening news, if he wants tenure. 
</P>
<P>
It's no longer enough to merely publish. Now, the slogan is: publicize or 
perish. 
</P>
<P>
The responsible media, of course, play their part in mumbo-jumbification. The 
responsible media cannot report on hearsay like "I Saw Elvis in My Tortilla!" 
They must look to reliable sources. "Corn Fungus Associated With Weird 
Hallucinations, Says University of Nebraska Researcher." 
</P>
<P>
The public walks around discussing research as if it were the latest joke: "Did 
you hear the one about sex and cholesterol?" 
</P>
<P>
A recent review of press releases from Dr. Grant Money, academic publicist, led 
me to conclude that most hot-for-the-press research falls into one of the 
following categories: 
</P>
<P>
1. Proof of the obvious. Obviously, we must prove that a virus exists before we 
attempt to create a vaccine. But do we really need scientific proof that "Rich 
Women Are Most Likely to Get Liposuctioned"? 
</P>
<P>
2. Proof of things we don't want to know. "Heroin Makes You Feel Good, Says 
Research Team." (Remember that the guys on the Manhattan Project gleefully 
pushed ahead until one day J. Robert Oppenheimer woke up and said, "Oops! We 
just figured out how to destroy civilization.") 
</P>
<P>
3. Proof of the irrelevant. "New Findings Suggest Shakespeare Wore Lace on 
Thursdays." 
</P>
<P>
4. Proof of things the funding agent wants proven. "Smoking Increases Genital 
Size, According to Tobacco Institute Study." 
</P>
<P>
5. Proof of things that create needless trouble. "85% of Women Think Men Are 
Real Jerks, Says Study." 
</P>
<P>
But what is most maddening about the current research climate is that when 
researchers finally do hit upon an area that is uncertain, complex and socially 
useful, we are then treated to Ping-Pong studies on the same subject for years 
to come. "Oat Bran Can Lower Cholesterol" is quickly followed by "Oat Bran 
Linked to Global Warming." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than waiting until final results are in, each researcher seeks to grab 
the spotlight with his inconclusive study. The effect is to leave the public 
unable to act intelligently. The public needs no help in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
There are two solutions to the research glut. One is to have a panel of wise 
men and women decide that only thorough, long-term studies of significant 
problems will be conducted. The other is to lock all the researchers in a room 
with a finite sack of money and study what happens.

Re "The Big Move" (May 23): As an ex-Californian now living in New York, every 
day I'm asked why someone like me would be crazy enough to move from Los

am crazy, but if you're not crazy, you don't belong here.

ERMA BOMBECK: THE BABY BOOMERS STRETCH A POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last 40 years, everyone has been trying to track the trends and buying 
habits of the baby boomers. Just because there are 77 million of them out 
there, they're all we hear about. The baby boomers are entering school. The 
baby boomers are starting families. The baby boomers are having plastic credit 
card implants put in both hands. 
</P>
<P>
If you're as breathless about their next move as I am, you should know that any 
minute now they will stop eating garlic bread and move on to English muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the habits of these people born from 1949 to 1965 are based on the 
history of those who are older than they are. As they move from one decade to 
the next, it's relatively easy to trace where they will spend their money and 
what they will be putting into their shopping carts. Publishers of magazines, 
car manufacturers, lending institutions, insurance companies, colleges and 
producers of consumer products hover over them like hawks, waiting to see where 
they can clean up on the next trend. 
</P>
<P>
Well, forget the year 2000, when it is predicted that baby boomers will buy bug 
spray, cleaning products to save them time, bran laxatives and 
environment-friendly cloth trash bags. I have seen their future -- and I'm it! 
And my insider's tip is, "Buy elastic!" 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, we're going to have 77 million people looking for their 
waistlines. The zippers that used to slide up and down easily will no longer 
come together. The thirtysomething who bought a Stairmaster after the birth of 
each baby could climb Mount Everest and still wouldn't lose a pound. Never 
before in the history of the world will we have 77 million people retaining 
water at the same time. Everything will have elastic: waistbands on slacks and 
skirts, belts, bathing suits, diapers, fanny packs, even panty hose. 
</P>
<P>
I know you think they have elastic now, but in the future I'm talking about 
elastic that gives. 
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that dieting will still be a major trend. Think about it. 
Here's a generation born to skim milk, sent to camps for the overweight in 
grade school, weaned on gyms, food pouches, powdered formulas and 
quick-weight-loss programs, seduced by marathons and 10-Ks, and who invented a 
whole new vocabulary, including "lite," "non-cholesterol," "no fat or 
caffeine," "reduced calories" and "less filling." Don't tell me they're not 
going to kick back finally and let it all hang out. "Buy elastic!"

ROGER SIMON: THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE S&amp;L MESS IS A 'TRAIN WRECK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News item, May 23, 1990: 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration today dramatically increased its estimates of the cost 
of rescuing the savings and loan industry based on a new forecast that as many 
as 1,030 institutions will fail. 
</P>
<P>
"Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told Congress the government will need to 
borrow between $90 billion and $130 billion to clean up the S&amp;L mess. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"These estimates do not include the cost of paying interest on the borrowings. 
When that figure is included, the S&amp;L bailout cost is expected to top $300 
billion." 
</P>
<P>
Aboard Air Force Two, Oct. 15, 1988, en route from Los Angeles to Stockton, 
Calif.: 
</P>
<P>
George Bush tells his press pool "there's no overconfidence at all" as he heads 
into the last weeks of the presidential campaign. "Some people are very 
excited," he says. "They are not the candidate. I'm the one running for 
President. They're not facing what I have to face every day." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter asks him how he slept after his second debate with Michael Dukakis 
two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sleep too well," Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? the reporter asks. 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew, I would have slept all right," Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
Another reporter asks him about the savings and loans across the nation that 
are in danger of failing because of their bad investments. Though it has never 
become an issue in the campaign, everybody knows there is a huge problem out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
He asks Bush if he expects that $100 billion will be needed to bail out the 
industry as some predict or whether $50 billion will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Bush scoffs at both figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we need to do that," he says. "(We need to) reassure the 
depositors that they are in no jeopardy at all. . . . I have no plans for a 
$50-billion bailout." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier, on Sept. 29, Dukakis had tried to raise the savings and loan 
mess as an issue. He said that "George Bush could have headed off" the S&amp;L 
crisis as vice president, and now it will cost "at least $50 billion" and maybe 
as much as "$70 billion" to pay for the bailout. 
</P>
<P>
In response, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and 
FSLIC, describes these estimates as "rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
Now, aboard Air Force Two, Bush is asked whether he has any bailout plan of his 
own, any figure of his own, to suggest. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he says. "I don't have a figure." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, the press pool will report Bush's statements to the rest of 
the reporters following the campaign. His quotes about not sleeping well and 
having no overconfidence will appear in story after story. 
</P>
<P>
Few reporters, however, will bother with the quotes on the savings and loan 
crisis. It is a crisis without drama. There are no hostages, no rising flood 
waters, no victims to be interviewed on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, most reporters, like most Americans, hate stories with numbers in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 6, 1989, about one month after his inauguration, George Bush announces 
a rescue plan for the nation's S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Price tag: $40 billion. The White House says it is confident this amount will 
be enough. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, Administration officials are questioned by reporters and admit the 
"true figure" might be closer to $126 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the Administration revises the figure upward, this time to 
$157 billion. Later, it climbs to $164 billion. 
</P>
<P>
On May 23, I call U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison (D-Conn.), a member of the House 
Banking Committee, who I have known since college. 
</P>
<P>
"The number are so high, they have no political impact," Morrison says. 
</P>
<P>
Who is going to pay for all of this? I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to come from the middle class," he says. "The poor can't pay and 
the rich won't and so middle-class America is going to get clobbered for the 
S&amp;L crisis." 
</P>
<P>
And it's really serious? 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about a real disaster," he says. "The true figures are 
staggering, astronomical. And neither party wants to face up to it. Among 
ourselves, though, we have a name for it. We call it the Train Wreck." 
</P>
<P>
And it's coming? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes," he says. "The Train Wreck is real. We are talking about real 
calamity for some people in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison explains he is not talking about people losing the money they now have 
in S&amp;Ls. That won't happen. What will happen instead is something less 
dramatic, but far more serious: 
</P>
<P>
Americans are not going to live as well. Some Americans have already started to 
notice it. It takes longer and longer to save for a house and some people may 
never be able to afford one. Some workers used to raises every year are no 
longer getting them. 
</P>
<P>
And in the future, as the debt for the savings and loan disaster must be paid, 
just one family crisis -- an illness or a layoff -- will reduce some 
middle-class families to poverty and even homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we face up to this, in the future Americans will be a lot poorer than 
they need to be," Morrison says. "We have been playing Russian roulette so far. 
But at some point, you get to where the chamber is loaded." 
</P>
<P>
On May 24, 1990, George Bush holds a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the impact on the taxpayer yet," he says of the crisis, and 
Administration officials "don't know a specific figure" for the ultimate cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't brush this problem under the rug," the President says. "It has been 
building for 20 years. And it is something that causes me great concern."

ZAN THOMPSON: AN ENJOYABLE PICNIC WITH BEETLES, LIZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The picnic remains at the top of my list of favorite social gatherings, far 
surpassing the formal dinner party or anything at which champagne is served. 
There is something about eating marvelous food in good company under a tree or 
in an open meadow that delights me. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Jean Erck and I went on a picnic to Indian Canyons, outside of 
Palm Springs. She had guests from Aspen, Colo., and she wanted to show them the 
beauty of the shady canyons. 
</P>
<P>
We had all the requisites for a picnic. Some things are indigenous to picnics 
and must be served. One of these is deviled eggs. We also had sandwiches on 
croissants and on French baguettes -- ham, turkey, Swiss cheese. We had potato 
salad, black olives and bread and butter pickles. Dessert was praline cookies 
and fruit, and we had a tall cooler of iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
We were in Palm Canyon where there are picnic tables and benches under the tall 
clusters of palm trees. A lot of the trees had scorched and blackened trunks 
where vandals had set fires under them and the trunks were carved with 
initials. I suspect that man has done this since he first found a sharp rock 
and a tree and turned to his friend and said, "Let's gouge these trees," but 
the antiquity of the damage doesn't make it any more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
A pickup truck and van were parked close to where we left Jean's car. The four 
men and one woman gathered around the vehicles were wearing floppy waders, and 
there was a thing that looked like a butterfly net with a long handle leaning 
against the van. They told us they were biologists from the University of 
Nevada at Las Vegas and Sacramento State University. They were on a week's 
exploration looking for a aquatic beetles. 
</P>
<P>
They were camping each night along their way. The young woman, Cheryl Barr, 
from Sacramento State, showed me a desert spring lizard. It was about seven 
inches long and iridescent green and purple, looking as if it might have been 
crafted by Faberge. The body seemed made of hundreds of tiny jewels. Cheryl 
looked at the lizard and said, "It's a female," with total assurance. Cheryl 
explained that the male has a brilliant blue stomach. Of course. How 
ostentatious. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bill Shepard, also from Sacramento State, said they had had a productive 
trip, gathering several kinds of aquatic beetles. Dr. Chad Murvosh from the 
University of Nevada wore a floppy hat Teddy Roosevelt would have loved. The 
third man was Pete Balfour from Sacramento State and the fourth was a graduate 
student named Lorne Seidman from University of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
They were having a fine time gathering beetles in a stream that hurried down 
the canyon. Dr. Shepard discovered a new beetle in the area where we had our 
picnic when they were on their field trip last year. "At least, it was a new 
population for this area." 
</P>
<P>
They were merry about their bugs and lizards and seemed to be having fun, as 
any sensible person would, wading around in cool water on a hot day with a blue 
sky and the palm trees making their rustling sounds overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Canyon is 15 miles long and was one of the canyons that was home to the 
Cahuilla Indians, who still own 32,000 acres of the desert. They were hunters 
and gatherers, eating the plants and animals the desert offered in profusion. 
Andreas and Murray are the names of the other two canyons. Palm and Andreas 
canyons have the most and the second-most, respectively, fan palm trees in the 
world, and Murray Canyon has the fourth largest number. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the desert hike in the canyons or ride horseback into the dark 
groves of palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
We went to the top of Palm Canyon and stopped at the trading post where the 
beautiful grass baskets made by the Cahuillas are for sale. Turquoise and 
silver jewelry and blankets woven in the soft desert colors are offered too. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lovely picnic day and the beetle people seemed to enjoy it, too.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
A FLURRY OF FLYERS, A TWIST IN OLD FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters will close a hectic spring election season Tuesday when they choose 
local leaders, party nominees for state legislative and congressional seats, 
and vote on referendums dealing with everything from crime to mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
Primaries in three Assembly contests in the region have drawn a flock of 
candidates, and three Long Beach runoffs could change the face of city 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A last-minute wave of mailers and knocking on doors is expected this weekend as 
candidates make their final pitches in a number of heated election battles. 
</P>
<P>
In the predominantly Republican 58th Assembly District, which runs from eastern 
Long Beach to Huntington Beach, five Republicans are scrambling after the GOP 
nomination in the wake of incumbent Dennis Brown's decision to drop out of 
politics. The district's Democratic primary fizzled when one of two contestants 
withdrew, leaving Luanne Pryor to carry the Democratic standard in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP race has been marked by accusations of special-interest influence and 
heavy spending on the part of the best-financed candidates, Long Beach 
physician Seymour (Sy) Alban and Huntington Beach developer Peter von Elten. 
</P>
<P>
The contest took a new turn last week when the longstanding feud between the 
California Medical Assn. and the California Chiropractors Assn. spilled over 
into the primary. Apparently concerned that Alban, who is backed by the medical 
association, might win the nomination, a political action committee financed by 
the chiropractors association mounted a $45,000 campaign on behalf of 
conservative candidate Thomas J. Mays, the mayor of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the two associations have been engaged in a battle in Sacramento 
over legislation regulating chiropractic treatments. Mays said he knew nothing 
about efforts by the chiropractors to elect him and has never spoken to 
representatives of their association. He suggested that the chiropractors 
simply want anybody but Alban in the Assembly seat, and they chose to aid him 
because he is considered one of the front-runners, along with Von Elten and 
Alban. 
</P>
<P>
The two remaining contestants, Long Beach City Council members Jan Hall and 
Jeffrey A. Kellogg, have both suffered from a lack of money, each raising 
slightly less than $50,000 as of mid-May. By comparison, Alban had nearly 
$200,000, Von Elten had spent $161,000, and Mays had nearly $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Alban, an abortion rights advocate, has attacked Mays' anti-abortion stand, 
whereas Mays has assailed Alban and Von Elten as the respective puppets of the 
medical association and the development community. Von Elten has responded by 
pointing out all the contributions that Mays has received from developers in 
Huntington Beach during this campaign and his tenure on the Huntington Beach 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the candidates for the Democratic primary in the 59th Assembly District 
will be walking precincts arm-in-arm with their chief supporters, despite 
recent criticism that powerful political patrons have played too great a role 
in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) will be joining his district 
representative, Marta Maestas, who he hopes will win the seat he vacated when 
he was sent to the Senate in a special election. State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) is expected to be making the rounds with candidate Xavier Becerra, and 
U.S. Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) is out with contestant Bill 
Hernandez. Candidate Diane Martinez said she did not know whether her father, 
U.S. Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), would be joining her. 
</P>
<P>
Only candidate Larry Salazar is without a powerful political ally. He has 
criticized the others, saying he is the only candidate who does not have to 
worry about "strings . . . being pulled by power groups." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell and three other Democrats are 
seeking the party's nomination in the 48th Assembly District, which cuts across 
South-Central Los Angeles and Watts and includes the cities of Lynwood and 
South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Also running are Marguerite Archie-Hudson, a former chief of staff for Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco); Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn Wells, 
and Roderick D. Wright, a former aide to Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los 
Angeles). Waters, who has held the seat for 14 years, is running for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Democratic political power Waters is not expected to have any problems 
winning the Democratic nomination for retiring U.S. Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins' 
29th Congressional District seat, which represents South-Central Los Angeles, 
Huntington Park, Cudahy, Lynwood and South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Waters has long been viewed as the likely successor to Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), 
82, who decided to retire after 28 years. Nonetheless, she said she is walking 
precincts and making five to six speaking engagements in a day in her run 
against opponents Lionel Allen, a financial consultant and real estate 
developer; Twain Wilson, an independent filmmaker, and Ted Andromidas, a Lyndon 
H. LaRouche Jr. Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence A. Grigsby is giving Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) a lively 
challenge in the Democratic primary in the 31st Congressional District, which 
runs south from Watts and Willowbrook through such cities as Compton, Lynwood 
and Carson before ending in North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Grigsby, an Inglewood attorney and a political newcomer, is backed by a group 
called the New Alliance Party. He and NAP, as the New York-based group is 
known, have been playing up Dymally's dealings with Zairian President Mobutu 
Sese Seko, whose government is described by the U.S. State Department as 
repressive and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally, who is seeking his sixth term, says Grigsby and his NAP backers are 
part of a political cult that is trying to discredit him in an attempt to set 
up shop in the Southland. Voters in the 31st do not care about Mobutu, Dymally 
says, and his dealings with the African head of state have all been aboveboard, 
he insists. Dymally won his most recent primary with 85% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, incumbent Mayor Ernie Kell has worked to beat back Councilman 
Tom Clark's challenge by assailing Clark's integrity. Last week, the Kell 
campaign continued the attack by complaining to the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission that Clark had violated contribution restrictions in three 
instances. In one, Kell noted that Clark had taken $1,000 from the president of 
a company and another $1,000 from the company, apparently exceeding the $1,000 
limit on contributions from firms or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll check these out. If there's anything in error, we'll correct it," said 
Clark, adding that if there were violations they were unintentional. "It's been 
filed; it's not something we're trying to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, an optometrist and veteran councilman, has scorned Kell's leadership, 
saying he has accomplished virtually nothing as the city's first full-time 
mayor. Kell has repeatedly cited what he has called Clark's "ethical problems," 
such as a 1988 episode when Clark lied about his identity when he was caught 
tearing down an opponent's campaign sign. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach City Council races, 1st District incumbent Evan Anderson Braude 
is running against Bill Stovall, a retired deputy police chief, and Planning 
Commissioner Jim Serles is making his third bid for the 3rd District seat, also 
being sought by Doug Drummond, a retired police commander.

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council candidate Bob Brazelton likes to cite his experience as a longtime 
planning commissioner when he talks of his qualifications for office. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more knowledgeable of the city and its needs," Brazelton said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Steve Pentoney, Brazelton's opponent in Tuesday's election, has never 
held a city post. But Pentoney says Brazelton is one of the good old boys at 
City Hall, and the voters of Downey's 4th District want a change. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I haven't been involved in some activities simply means I'm not 
affiliated . . . and I'm better able to listen," Pentoney said. 
</P>
<P>
The race was set into motion when two-term Councilman Randall R. Barb decided 
to retire, citing family and business reasons. Barb ran unopposed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
District 4, which runs north of Firestone Boulevard and east of Downey Avenue, 
includes some of Downey's most affluent residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Roy L. Paul is unopposed in District 2, which encompasses the 
southwest part of the city. Council terms run for four years. 
</P>
<P>
There appear to be no heated issues in the District 4 campaign. Both 
candidates, for example, express similar views on one of the biggest issues to 
divide the city in recent years -- the use of eminent domain in redevelopment. 
Both say the city should use its powers to condemn property only as a last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent residents and political observers throughout the city have taken 
sides, but several agreed that both men are qualified. Both are lawyers with 
considerable business experience, and both are longtime Downey residents who 
raised families there. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton, 60, has higher name recognition because of his stint on the Planning 
Commission -- from October 1982 to last January -- and his involvement with the 
local YMCA and Camp Fire, among other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney, 51, has been involved in local school and youth activities, such as 
Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton has been able to raise about twice as much campaign money as 
Pentoney. As of May 19, Brazelton had raised $15,014 and spent $7,166, whereas 
Pentoney had raised $6,450 and spent $5,301, according to campaign disclosure 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Joyce Lawrence favors Brazelton. "I think (Pentoney) 
would be a good candidate, but I think Bob (Brazelton) has proven that he is a 
leader," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Lubin, a local Democratic Party leader and political observer, favors 
Pentoney in the nonpartisan race. "They're two high-integrity candidates," 
Lubin said. "But I like the fresh-face idea." Both candidates are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton, who said he believes the council in general has done a good job, is 
backed by Barb and many other city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney said the council has not always been open with local residents about 
key decisions, such as the recent sale of the Embassy Suites Hotel to a 
Japanese firm. He has branded Brazelton an extension of Barb, who some critics 
say has favored well-connected constituents. Barb was criticized last year, for 
example, for strongly pushing the appointment of a friend, D. Clayton Mayes, as 
police chief. The Downey Police Officers Assn. has endorsed Pentoney. 
</P>
<P>
But Brazelton, who was Barb's campaign treasurer, said he will be an 
independent thinker if elected. "I've always been my own person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney also has pointed out that Brazelton has had to abstain from Planning 
Commission decisions because his law firm has represented residents before the 
city, and because he owns a 5% interest in a building in a city redevelopment 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney said residents should elect a councilman who will be able to vote all 
the time. He said he has no business interests in the city, and that the only 
property he owns in Downey is his home. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton acknowledged that he abstained from several Planning Commission 
decisions. But he said there should be no need to abstain as a councilman. He 
said he persuaded the partners in his law firm not to take clients dealing with 
the city, and he is in the process of selling his interest in the local 
building.

THE HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Act 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 401 to 21, the House sent to conference with the Senate a bill (HR 
3030) giving the Clean Air Act its first upgrade since 1977. In part, the 
measure drastically cuts emissions from Midwest and Appalachian power plants 
that cause acid rain, imposes tailpipe controls on motor vehicles and 
introduces cleaner gasoline to cities with the dirtiest air. 
</P>
<P>
It curbs the discharge of a wide range of toxic chemicals from factories such 
as petrochemical plants and harmful emissions from small businesses such as dry 
cleaners. Estimates are that the bill will cost the private sector up to $20 
billion over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Norman F. Lent (R-N.Y.) said the bill "will significantly improve the 
air we breathe without placing the American economy in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said: "This should be renamed the 
Third World Redevelopment Act of 1990" because it exports many jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the bill.

New Relief Program 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 274 to 146, the House adopted an amendment establishing special 
relief for workers who lose their jobs or have their hours reduced by at least 
20% as a result of the new clean air legislation (above). The maximum benefit 
would be an additional six months of unemployment payments and two years of 
retraining assistance, at a cost to the Treasury of up to $250 million over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Harley O. Staggers Jr. (D-W.Va.) said: "This is a vote for the little 
guys" such as coal miners who lose work because of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jack Fields (R-Tex.) called the program "an open-ended liability for 
the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported special aid to workers hurt by new clean air legislation.

The House adopted, 239 to 180, an amendment toughening warranties on the 
catalytic converters and electronic control units needed to meet tailpipe 
emission standards set by the new clean air legislation (above). Auto makers 
would have to provide eight-year, 80,000-mile protection on the equipment,

DROUGHT IS NO DETERRENT TO RIVER RAFTERS SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As long as water runs downhill, thrill-seekers and nature lovers will want to 
ride it in rubber rafts, come flood, dam or drought. 
</P>
<P>
And they can, despite alarm about California's acute thirst and lower snow 
packs throughout the West in general. Nate Rangel, operator of the Adventure 
Connection and state chairman of the Western River Guides Assn., said: "Even 
though we're in the fourth year of a low-water situation, we've got pretty good 
water . . . in some cases excellent water." 
</P>
<P>
The difference now is that choosing the time and place is more important. Some 
free-flowing rivers unsupported by upstream reservoirs will dry up by 
mid-summer, if they haven't already. 
</P>
<P>
But even as restrictions on water use are imposed, the flows will continue 
where water releases from reservoirs are controlled for power or fishery 
purposes, and the white-water rafters will go with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Rafters need water but don't deplete it. They are what environmentalists call 
"non-consumptive" users of the resource. Give them enough water to make a rapid 
and they're happy. 
</P>
<P>
"We get what we need when we need it, because our needs coincide with the power 
companies," Rangel said. His company runs rafting trips on the reservoir-fed 
American River near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
On other rivers there are mandates to maintain minimal flows for fish life. So 
even on, say, the Middle Fork of the American, they'll almost always have some 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
Bill McGinnis of Whitewater Voyages in Richmond said, "Quite a few rivers -- 
the Yuba, the Merced and the North Fork of the American are affected more 
because they don't have those upstream reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
"Those rivers in years with an above-normal snow pack will have about a 120-day 
season -- end of March, April, May, June, sometimes into early July. In a year 
like this, they might have only a 60-day season." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Ashburn of EarthTrek Expeditions in Santa Ana said: "People hear the 
drought stories and relate it to (there being) no river rafting. We've had a 
lot of people cancel because they hear there's no water in the rivers. We're 
running very good but you can't convince them of that." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Stratton of Tour West in Orem, Utah, which books trips through the Grand 
Canyon and elsewhere, said: "We've had a 20% reduction (in business) but 
they're booking for later. A lot of 'em call in and find out there is water. We 
have to reassure them." 
</P>
<P>
In one curious twist, the drought has brought a historic white-water river back 
to life. 
</P>
<P>
The old main fork of the Stanislaus, the old Camp 9 run, is where white-water 
rafting started in California after World War II. Adventurers brought war 
surplus life rafts to challenge the "Stan," which had everything: beauty, 
adventure and a sense of history as it tumbled down the west slope of the 
Sierra Nevada through the Mother Lode country between Angels Camp and Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
Passages such as the Rock Garden, Death Rock and Widowmaker Rapid became 
legendary, and by the '70s as many as 25,000 people a year were taking the run. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the early '80s, following a 20-year court fight, the New Melones 
Reservoir was built at the bottom of the run. As the reservoir filled, 
opponents chained themselves to rocks and trees along the banks, but by '82 the 
water had backed up into the gorge, drowning the river. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the reservoir shrinking into a puddle, the river, controlled by dams 
upstream, has found its way back, cutting through 20 feet of silt into the old 
cataracts and rapids. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis said: "Four years of light snow pack have caused New Melones to drop 
enough to reveal this run again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the same run, scenery-wise, because the trees have been killed by the 
reservoir, but the same rapids have re-emerged. The flowing water has cut down 
through the reservoir silt and you have the same classic rapids that were the 
birthplace of white-water boating in California." 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis' company is running one-day trips for $89 on the Stanislaus, a chance 
for rafters to relive rafting history, as long as they don't wait too long. 
</P>
<P>
"This year and maybe next year," Whitewater Voyages general manager Larry Ogden 
said, " -- until the reservoir fills back up." 
</P>
<P>
The restored Stanislaus is rated Class III, in the middle of the rafting scale 
for danger and difficulty. The level and volume of water can alter a rating, 
making it less exciting or more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the river," Ferguson said. "There were a couple of drownings on 
the North Fork American several years ago; people were trying to run it when 
there were a lot of exposed rocks and undercut things that usually aren't 
exposed." 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said: "Some rapids improve when the water goes down. If it's too high 
you're just in the tube." 
</P>
<P>
Other runs, such as Cataract Canyon on the Colorado in Utah above Lake Powell, 
lose their punch. Normally a 20-mile, Class IV run, at its current low flows 
Cataract Canyon is only a Class III. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as much fun," Stratton said, "except for one rapid they call Big 
Drop. That's always a tough rapid . . . always a thrill. But some rapids get so 
small you feel like jumping out and floating it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis said some rivers change their character but remain just as difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The abruptness of the drops in some rapids makes up for the smaller waves. You 
still have a sense of plunging over steep drops." 
</P>
<P>
Most outfitters will switch to smaller boats for lower flows. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have quite the same sense of risk or fear that the fast water and 
big waves and large volumes of water have," McGinnis said. "Everything happens 
more slowly. But it's still exciting, and the water tends to be warmer." 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said: "If the water's real high, we'll put on the big rafts because 
they're safer." 
</P>
<P>
But low water, the outfitters say, is no reason to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't affect the food and the scenery and all the other things you go 
for," Stratton said.

THE PRIMARY ISSUE: NOT THE CANDIDATES, BUT GOVERNMENT BY PLEBISCITE

Here it is, finally -- the last weekend before the California primary. By now, 
voters should be aware of the candidates for governor and their programs. 
Right? So, class, pencils out. It's time for a pop quiz: 
</P>
<P>
Match the statements below with the Democratic or Republican candidate for 
governor who made them -- A) Dianne Feinstein; B) John K. Van de Kamp; C) Pete 
Wilson: 
</P>
<P>
1) "I've always said education would be my first priority as governor." 
</P>
<P>
2) "(Education will be) a visible and active priority in my administration." 
</P>
<P>
3) "We will bring great and lasting change to California's educational 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Pencils down, please. The correct answers are: 1,B; 2,A; 3,C. 
</P>
<P>
This exercise illustrates how difficult it is to differentiate among the 
candidates' stands on major issues. Democratic Party opponents Feinstein and 
Van de Kamp and Republican Wilson are all pro-education, pro-environment, 
pro-abortion rights (to one degree or another). They've all refused to take the 
"no-new-taxes" pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The message is clear. The direction of state policy probably won't differ 
dramatically, whoever wins. Other decisions on Tuesday's ballot will have a 
greater impact on the state's political and economic future. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will face 17 ballot propositions; they will decide on policies ranging 
from amending the Gann state spending limit to increasing fines for violating 
the state's Chiropractic Act. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the state's "ballot box budgeting," Californians will vote on about 
$22.6 billion in state spending; $18.5 billion of that would fund 
transportation projects that would be triggered by the passage of Propositions 
108 and 111. The rest is largely bonding authority -- which is not subject to 
the Gann limit -- for other growth areas such as housing, prisons and school 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
That presents a great irony. Direct democracy has turned California elections 
into enormous town meetings. And the chief executive of the most populous state 
in the union seems little more than the administrator of policies set by 
California's real governors -- the small number of people and groups (including 
governors and legislators themselves) who qualify initiatives for the ballot 
and the voters who determine their fate. 
</P>
<P>
Four proposals on Tuesday's ballot may chart the political and economic course 
of the state. They are Propositions 111 and 112, placed on the ballot by the 
Legislature, and Propositions 118 and 119, voter-qualified initiatives that 
would change the way legislative and congressional districts are drawn after 
each decennial census. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the electorate over state policy is clearly shown in the impact 
that voter action on Proposition 111 will have on the state budget process. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111's provision to amend the state expenditure limit provides a 
major test of the public's willingness to give back to their elected 
representatives greater control over government spending. It will allow the 
governor more flexibility in budgeting -- something George Deukmejian complains 
he has been denied by "laws, mandates and court orders that have tied our hands 
and threaten the fiscal health of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111's provision for an increase in the state gas tax is being 
viewed nationwide as a bellwether of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Roam the halls of California's state Capitol these days. It is like being in 
the eye of a hurricane. The state faces a projected $3.6-billion deficit, yet 
there is little movement toward solving the escalating crisis. Government is in 
a state of suspended animation. "Politicians," one legislative insider 
predicted, "will wait until after the election to gauge the psychology of the 
voters, to see how far they can go." 
</P>
<P>
If 111 passes, the word will go forth all the way to Washington -- where 
President George Bush and Congress, like their nervous counterparts in 
Sacramento, eagerly await a sign -- that the post-Proposition 13 era has truly 
ended and people are once again willing to be taxed -- some -- to improve the 
quality of their life. 
</P>
<P>
If 111 fails, politicians may once again duck and run. Democrats, in 
particular, will have to face hard choices on spending cuts. Regardless of 
111's fate, Deukmejian has ruled out a general tax increase to fund 
underbudgeted health and welfare programs -- all areas of concern for 
traditional Democratic constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has vowed not to balance the budget on the backs of "the poor, the 
blind and disabled." Feinstein at first agreed with Deukmejian's position that 
all state spending -- including cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of 
state social-services programs -- should be placed "on the table." She quickly 
backtracked -- this is a Democratic primary, after all. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition 111 fails, whoever governs may not have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
There is a second legislative constitutional amendment on the ballot that can 
have a significant impact. Born out of public indignation over the FBI Capitol 
sting and its political fallout, Proposition 112 is the Legislature's 
long-overdue response to the perception that Sacramento is a "swamp" corrupted 
by special-interest money. It would provide for the implementation of a 
comprehensive code of ethics for state elected officials -- a necessary first 
step toward restoring public confidence in a system gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the creation of an independent "California citizens 
compensation commission" with the authority to set salaries of legislators and 
other state officers (current law allows the Legislature to raise its own 
salary -- but not more than 5% a year). 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 112 is not, as opponents argue, a legislative pay raise disguised 
as ethics reform. But it does place the question of adequate compensation for 
government officials squarely on the table. And that can set the stage for a 
healthy discourse on how Californians view their representatives and the worth 
of the legislative process. What kind of Legislature do we want? How should it 
function? What are we willing to pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
The debate over what the Legislature will look like is also central to 
Propositions 118 and 119. Both address fundamental political change. 
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment, say the initiative's opponents in their ubiquitous television 
spots, is really about power. They are right. Both proposals would favor 
Republicans by stripping the majority party of its control over the political 
and demographic makeup of California's Legislature and congressional 
delegation. Both would also change the governor's role. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans rallied around Pete Wilson because, under the current 
reapportionment system, they knew they needed the strongest possible candidate 
to keep the governor's seat. In redistricting negotiations, a Republican 
governor provides leverage against a Democratic legislative majority. 
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, the powerful Waxman-Berman political organization 
anointed Feinstein their candidate when it looked like she'd be the stronger 
choice against Wilson in November. A Democratic victory could shut Republicans 
out of redistricting as Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown and legislative Democrats 
did in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, if the voters pass either initiative, all this slick strategizing 
may be moot. Under Proposition 118, for a reapportionment plan to take effect, 
the voters will have the final say. And under Proposition 119, the governor and 
the Legislature will be cut almost completely out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
The complex issues facing voters on the June ballot are just the tip of the 
iceberg. Thirty-eight initiatives, running the gamut from more auto-insurance 
reform to pest eradication, are currently making the rounds for the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
With California beleaguered by "government by plebiscite," why are seemingly 
rational individuals running around the state spewing proposals and press 
releases, attacking each other and spending millions of dollars to win a 
governorship that continues to atrophy? 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate how ludicrous the process has become, think about this: Even if 
Van de Kamp, who trails in the polls, doesn't make it to the finals, he could 
end up having a greater impact on state policy than the ultimate winner. Why? 
</P>
<P>
If Van de Kamp should lose Tuesday's Democratic primary, but any or all of his 
three major initiatives -- on environment, government ethics and crime -- make 
it to the November ballot and pass, the next governor may take office hamstrung 
by policies that he or she had no hand in formulating -- and may not even have 
supported. (The same could hold true if Proposition 115, Wilson's crime 
initiative, passes Tuesday and Van de Kamp is the victor in November.) 
</P>
<P>
The state's chief executive could be in the bizarre position of administering 
programs whose author he or she defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Look carefully at what's happening in the trend-setting state of California. If 
you think its politics supply any semblance of representative democracy, I have 
a bridge I'd like to sell you.

BEYOND THE SUPERPOWER SUMMIT HYPE; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY: WHETHER U.S.-SOVIET DEFENSE CUTS CAN RESTORE THE ECONOMIC LUSTER OF 
THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL REQUIRE CHOICES NO TWO LEADERS CAN MAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Kennedy, Paul Kennedy, a professor of history at Yale University, is 
the author of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (Random). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW HAVEN, CONN. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superpower summits inevitably produce grand opportunities for the leaders of 
each nation. Regardless of their substance, summits permit both U.S. and Soviet 
Presidents to claim foreign-policy success. 
</P>
<P>
The massive media attention arising from these events boosts the leaders far 
above their domestic critics. Both can claim that they are making the world 
safer, and can now divert valuable national resources from swords to 
plowshares. But historians of the rise and fall of nations cannot help but 
wonder whether the superpowers are really learning anything from history. 
</P>
<P>
In arms agreements unimaginable only two years ago, both the United States and 
Soviet Union have been shedding the military burdens that were dragging them 
down like so many empires before them. Presidential staffs and advisers, not to 
mention strategic think tanks and analysts, are positively giddy. Instead of 
plans for new armaments, there is the cancellation of existing and prototype 
weapons. Instead of a fully blown concentration on a battle in the Fulda Gap, 
or off the Greenland Straits, there is a desperate attempt by the armed 
services to scale down and "reshape" themselves for operations in other parts 
of the world that (we are solemnly assured) have now become more turbulent and 
unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
However one assesses the likelihood and seriousness of regional conflicts, the 
prevailing mood among the decision-makers of both superpowers appears to be 
that an open U.S.-Soviet military conflict nowadays is highly implausible and 
that they should get on with making peace, not war. 
</P>
<P>
What can have caused this swift transformation from Cold War to unprecedented 
detente? The simplest answer -- and that favored by the political right in the 
United States -- is that the Soviet Union "cracked." Unable to match the 
American rearmament program because of its inefficient and stagnant economy, a 
more realistic leadership under Mikhail S. Gorbachev decided that compromise 
was necessary: Having failed to "win" the arms race, the Soviet Union needed to 
get out of it as expeditiously as possible. 
</P>
<P>
While it was humiliating to concede an American victory, it was more important 
to concentrate resources on restructuring the Soviet economy, aided, as part of 
the detente "deal," by Western credits, technology and other assistance. With 
restoration of the Soviet economy, however, the future of Soviet military would 
be an open issue. Because Moscow's military climb-down was a coldly pragmatic 
decision, the argument of the right goes, the United States ought not to be 
lulled into a sense of false security. 
</P>
<P>
A different explanation might be that policy-makers in Moscow -- and even in 
the United States -- had begun to appreciate the mutual folly of their 1980s 
arms race. In other words, they had begun to ponder the lessons of history. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the arms race was at its height, critics pointed out that the 
superpowers ran the risk of hurting themselves economically and thus grow 
weaker in the long run. Scholars like Richard Rosecrance, in his 1986 book "The 
Rise of the Trading State," observed that once again in world history, 
overmilitarized nations were being quietly challenged by societies that 
preferred commerce to conquest. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing chorus of voices pointed to the irony that Japan and Germany, 
losers of World War II, were becoming the real "winners" of the Cold War. This 
message, it is becoming evident, struck home among the new thinkers surrounding 
Gorbachev and Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Deeply concerned about the structural 
weaknesses in the Soviet economy and society, eager to promote political and 
constitutional change before there was a full-scale collapse, and pressing for 
a firm check on runaway defense expenditures, Soviet intellectuals could 
clearly see the analogy between their country's plight and the fate of the 
Hapsburg and Ottoman empires. 
</P>
<P>
In such circles, "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" and other historically 
based studies are used as an argument against their own archconservatives in 
the military and among Russian nationalists who still want large-scale spending 
on armaments. 
</P>
<P>
Did such a change of mood also occur in the United States? In Congress and in 
public opinion at large, the answer must be yes. Nothing can have been as 
confusing to traditional Cold War warriors during the past few years than the 
news that a large majority of Americans regard threats to their economic 
security (usually meaning Japan) as more serious than threats to their military 
security (usually meaning the Soviet Union). 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats may have lost the 1988 presidential election on the issue of 
America's military might, but much of the debate continues. Is too much being 
spent on armaments? How can the economy become more competitive? What is the 
use of being "secure" in the Indian Ocean's sea lanes if we are not secure in 
our inner cities? Will the budgetary and trade deficits bring us down? 
</P>
<P>
Once the summit is over, therefore, both Presidents will have to attend to 
their much less happy domestic fronts. In Gorbachev's case, the problems look 
daunting: From the fundamental failure to get the Soviet economy working to the 
threatened breakup of the union itself, the difficulties are so profound that 
it is hard to believe that a reduction in defense spending alone would solve 
them. It's difficult to imagine just how the Soviet Union, no matter how big 
its "peace dividend," can compete with East Asia or a revived Europe in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The relative decline of the Soviet Union, no matter how successful arms- 
control agreements may be, is therefore most likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The position of the United States is, as before, much more uncertain. Signs of 
strength mingle with signs of weakness, voices of confidence challenge the 
doubters and pessimists. Nonetheless, there is enough evidence -- in the 
savings-and-loan crisis, in the plight of the inner cities and public schools, 
in the decomposition of the domestic automobile industry, in the ability of 
vested interests to block structural reforms -- to suggest that the struggle to 
remain competitive with Europe and Asia over the longer term, and thus to 
preserve the American position in world affairs, will be hard, unrelenting and 
not very easy to measure. 
</P>
<P>
But that also has historical precedents, since many of the great powers of the 
past, such as Britain, did not collapse dramatically and suddenly, but instead 
faded away as imperial powers, decade after decade, generation after 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bush and Gorbachev have really learned those lessons cannot be proved 
by a summit, with all of its bonhomie and media hype and public pronouncements. 
It will be proved in the efforts that the two administrations devote to 
persuading their peoples to take seriously the challenge to both the Soviet and 
the American position in world affairs by the rising commercial powers. 
</P>
<P>
That implies unpopular choices on the domestic front, as well as popular 
proposals on arms reduction. Because of that, it will be some years yet before 
the historian can judge whether Soviet and American efforts in the 1990s to 
control defense costs and improve economic competitiveness do succeed in 
reversing the course of decline.

PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWS CHINA'S FAVORED-NATION TRADING STATUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Bush's China policy: Whatever happened to "Let me walk a mile in my 
neighbors moccasins. . . ." Multiply the ills of the United States -- poverty, 
drugs, crime, health care, burdened legal system -- by four and place them in 
an environment of dwindling resources. The question is not what's good for 
America's future, but what will work for a country with 1 billion people and 
limited resources.

PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWS CHINA'S FAVORED-NATION TRADING STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status 
is the moral equivalent of grave desecration. While this decision may make 
economic sense for some American businesses, it makes no sense to the cause of 
democratization in China and it is that cause which should receive the primary 
attention of the President. However, since last June's massacre of 
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square by the "butchers of Beijing," 
the Bush Administration has nervously pursued a policy of reconciliation with 
China's totalitarian leadership. This policy was ostensibly designed to 
minimize the damage to American economic interests in China produced by an 
outraged American public that expected their President to speak out and act on 
behalf of democratization in China. Unfortunately, America's leaders have yet 
to learn that the interests of democratization are not necessarily compatible 
with America's economic interests! 
</P>
<P>
Given the Bush Administration's feigned interest in a democratic China, I am 
compelled to ask a question reminiscent of Ronald Reagan: Is the cause of 
democracy in China better off today than it was a year ago? Absolutely not! 
There is far more systematic oppression and repression in China today than 
there was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Further degradation and humiliation has been perpetrated on the people of every 
Asian nation by the Bush Administration's decision to withhold 
most-favored-nation status from the Soviet Union because the Lithuanian 
question remains unresolved. Why should we value the human rights of 
Lithuanians more than the human rights of the Chinese? The answer rests in the 
priority the Bush Administration gives to American economic interests at the 
expense of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration actions teach that when it comes to the cause of 
democratization around the world, one minimalist response deserves another. 
This decision, as with so many others promulgated by the Bush Administration, 
also constitutes a grave insult to the millions of Americans who throughout our 
history believed that this nation stood for the pursuit of democracy and 
freedom first. If this was ever the case, President Bush's action should 
convince us that it's not true any more!

PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWS CHINA'S FAVORED-NATION TRADING STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush blew it this time! And your editorial ("Just More Champagne for 
Beijing?" May 25) endorsing his decision to extend most-favored-nation status 
to China demonstrates a shocking lack of understanding as to what drives 
revolutionary reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The incredible changes we see throughout the world are driven not by 
ideological desires, but by the bread-and-butter economics of everyday 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets and their former Eastern European allies are moving towards reform 
because their economies are bankrupt after 40 years of pursuing the unworkable 
policies of Marxist economics. The changes in South Africa are not the result 
of the sudden enlightenment of President Frederik de Klerk as to the inherent 
justice of racial equality and human rights, but rather, the reforms are a 
recognition that his country is economically isolated and an international 
pariah. 
</P>
<P>
History shows that U.S. trade policies have little to do with the concerns of 
common citizens. By extending MFN status to China, President Bush, his 
statements to the contrary notwithstanding, sends the message that the U.S. is 
prepared to accept the status quo and "do business" with those currently in 
power. By denying the Chinese government this much-sought plum of international 
trade, our government could have sped the process by which the Chinese 
themselves seek to reform their nation. 
</P>
<P>
The truest axiom in the world today is that the need for economic reform drives 
political reform, not the other way around.

3 TRANSPORTATION PROPOSITIONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 111 is much more than the doubling of state fuel taxes and an 
increase in the trucking weight fees. 
</P>
<P>
These alone would be inflationary and detrimental to the state's economy. 
However, the real danger of Prop. 111 is that it will eliminate the 1979 
constitutional limits on government spending imposed by the Gann initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 111 not only authorizes increased spending at all levels of government, 
it also creates a huge loophole at the state level by allowing the Legislature 
to exclude capital outlays as it sees fit. The truth is that politicians, 
government bureaucracies and special interest lobbies have a vested interest in 
expanded government power. 
</P>
<P>
Voters should reject Prop. 111 on Tuesday.

3 TRANSPORTATION PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your editorial "Making a Case for Car-Pool Lanes: Prop. 111 Would 
Aid Riverside and Orange Counties" (May 14). There are unrecognized but 
reasonable reasons why car-pooling is not as easy to develop as planned for. 
</P>
<P>
However, the primary reason for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes -- the hope 
of reducing the number of cars on the freeways -- can be achieved by use of 
buses in HOV lanes. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the El Monte busway, which is nothing but a separate car-pool or 
HOV lane on the San Bernardino Freeway from El Monte to Los Angeles, carries as 
many passengers as a light-rail line. The Southern California Transportation 
Action Committee has advocated running buses on the freeways for years. Buses 
can do what trains cannot -- leave the freeway and deliver passengers to 
airports, places of employment, shopping centers, etc. Just think, HOV lanes 
with buses on the 91 and 55 Freeways might make Ontario Airport a feasible 
alternative to John Wayne for Orange County passengers.

A PLO TRICK SHORES UP SHAMIR'S WEB; 
</P>
<P>
WE COULD BE ENSNARED BY MAKING HIS ENEMIES OUR ENEMIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. BUCHANAN, Patrick J. Buchanan writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Were it not for alert Israeli forces, we would likely have seen, live on CNN, 
slaughtered sunbathers, women and children, being carried off the beaches of 
Tel Aviv as Israeli troops fought it out with suicide squads. 
</P>
<P>
Five speedboats, carrying 16 guerrillas armed with rockets and machine guns, 
were reportedly dropped off a Libyan "mother ship," 120 miles at sea. The 
guerrillas were picked up on radar 20 miles off the coast, and intercepted. 
Four were killed, 12 captured. The Palestine Liberation Front, a small, radical 
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
But, at whom was this attack aimed, besides Jews? 
</P>
<P>
One target, surely, was Yasser Arafat. Should he denounce it, only days after 
Israel brutally crushed a resurgent intifada, Arafat would appear both an 
appeaser and a weak leader unable to control his own PLO. Should he remain 
silent, the suggestion is that he approves; if he approves, Washington stops 
doing business with him. Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens was quick to 
exploit Arafat's vulnerability: "An event like this comes along . . . and 
proves something that we have been claiming all along . . . . The United States 
is holding talks with the PLO based on the assumption that the PLO has stopped 
engaging in terror." 
</P>
<P>
A second target was the moderate Arabs. A massacre would have brought Israeli 
retaliation (it still might), raising war fever, rallying Arab support for 
hawks like Iraq's Saddam Hussein, drowning out and isolating men like Egypt's 
President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
A third target was the peace party in Israel. Had a massacre occurred, it would 
have reduced to silence those Israeli voices who urge negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Who benefits? First, extreme elements of the PLO who despise Arafat for dealing 
with the Americans, and want to cut his U.S. connection before it produces a 
Palestinian state on the West Bank that recognizes Israel and puts an end to 
their dream of liquidating "the Zionist entity." 
</P>
<P>
Among other beneficiaries is Yitzhak Shamir, whose party seized upon it as 
proof that its hard line against self-determination for the Palestinian people 
is the only position consistent with the safety of the Israeli people. Who can 
argue with him now? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is: We can and we must, if we do not wish to be led down a road at 
the end of which lies a Middle East war that would be a disaster for U.S. 
interests in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
For Shamir, the attack, like the latest Jerusalem bombing, is a godsend, making 
ancient history of his crackdown that left a dozen Palestinians dead and 900 
wounded. But the Palestinian question must not be put on a back burner. If it 
is, sooner or later, the burner will explode. 
</P>
<P>
Peace between Israel and the Arab states can never come until the core quarrel 
is addressed, a quarrel that former Foreign Minister Abba Eban describes thus: 
"Our land is a land of two histories, two tongues, two faiths, two national 
dreams, two identities. Duality is written so sharply into the very texture of 
the land that any unitary solution subjecting one nationalism to domination by 
the other is bound to be explosive and morally fragile . . . sovereignty and 
territory must be shared by two groups, not monopolized by one." 
</P>
<P>
What Eban is saying, what retired Israeli officers are saying, what a million 
Israelis have voted for, is "land for peace," a homeland on the West Bank and 
Gaza for Palestinians, in return for guarantees that land not be used as a base 
camp to attack Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Utopian? Perhaps. But repression of the Palestinians, brought to the Arab world 
on weekly television, is a formula for endless hatred. There is no guarantee 
that a Palestinian homeland will bring permanent peace; but, if there is no 
homeland, permanent war is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Shamir, Eban writes, is a "sincere territorialist." He "opposed the 
Egyptian-Israeli treaty, the withdrawal from Lebanon, the Hussein-Peres 
agreement for a Jordanian-Palestinian solution, former U.S. Secretary of State 
George Shultz's friendly peace plan and even the renunciation of the 
inconsequential hotel on Egyptian soil in Taba." I.e., his interests are not 
our interests. 
</P>
<P>
After Suez in 1956, Great Britain extricated itself from the Middle East; but, 
after the '67 war, the United States decided to grab the tar baby. What vital 
interest of ours was at risk, in this terrible quarrel, is yet difficult to 
see. But, even if we have commitments we cannot walk away from, we must not 
give Yitzhak Shamir a blank check, to make his enemies our enemies. For they 
are legion.

DESPITE RESIDENCY FLAP, FARRELL PROVES TOUGH FOR ARCHIE-HUDSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Marguerite Archie-Hudson came into the battle for the Democratic nomination for 
Maxine Waters' 48th Assembly District seat with heavy-duty political armaments. 
</P>
<P>
She had a larger war chest than any of her opponents, the official endorsement 
of the California Democratic Party, plus the blessings of Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Waters, a Democrat who is vacating her seat 
after a 14-year tenure to run for Congress. Perhaps most important, she had 
access to Waters' highly effective political machine. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final days of the primary campaign, it remains unclear whether 
Archie-Hudson, a one-time Brown aide and former Los Angeles Community College 
District trustee, can parlay those advantages into a victory Tuesday over Los 
Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell, the most formidable of her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Democratic candidates are considered long shots in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of Farrell's staunchest political foes are cautiously giving him the 
edge in the race, despite questions raised last week about whether he is 
legally eligible to be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's voter registration card lists an address in the 48th District as his 
residence, but the owners of the home dispute that, saying Farrell began the 
process of buying the property from them in February but allowed the deal to 
lapse. 
</P>
<P>
California law requires that candidates for Assembly seats live in their 
respective districts at the time nomination filing papers are issued. Aside 
from the legal question surrounding Farrell's residency, the flap has raised 
the political question of his commitment to the 48th District. 
</P>
<P>
Kerman Maddox, who helped spearhead an unsuccessful drive to recall Farrell 
from his council seat two years ago, said the residency issue may have cropped 
up too late to harm Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
"Had this come out a week before and dragged out, Marguerite could have 
snatched it and run," Maddox said. "It's a great hit. It's a real issue. But 
it's real late." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers agree that the one most important advantage Farrell has in 
the race is name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
He has been on the City Council 16 years, and in that time has built a 
following of loyal supporters. His council district overlaps much of the 
portion of the 48th Assembly District that is within the city of Los Angeles. 
The district also includes the cities of Lynwood and South Gate, as well as 
unincorporated county areas. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdia Harris, 73, a longtime community activist who heads a coalition of 30 
block clubs in South-Central and Southeast Los Angeles, said she doesn't care 
whether Farrell actually lives in the 48th. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them live where they say they live. It's just a joke anyway," she 
said, referring to officeholders and candidates in South-Central in general. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Pursley, another coalition leader, also continues to support Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
"He just should have gotten a better lie, and he should have gotten his lie 
together," said Pursley. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such support, Farrell's record has been the subject of harsh criticism 
during the campaign. His opponents have contended that his future effectiveness 
as a politician can be best measured by the deterioration that has occurred 
within his council district during his tenure. They cite increases in gang 
violence, drug-trafficking and other crimes, the flight of businesses from the 
district and chronic joblessness among many of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
Archie-Hudson, at a candidates forum last week, promised that as an Assembly 
member she would push for state programs that stress job training, economic 
development and improvements to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Similar promises were made by the other Democratic candidates, Lynwood City 
Councilwoman Evelyn Wells, political consultant Roderick Wright and write-in 
candidate Brenda Moffett, a Watts activist. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrat who is victorious Tuesday will face Republican Gloria Salazar and 
Libertarian Jose Castaneda in the November general election.

IT'S NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL AS 2 WALK IN ON EMPTY BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City National Bank at Sunset Boulevard and Doheny Road in West Hollywood 
was open Saturday -- but it wasn't supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
The double glass doors at the front entrance were unlocked when two customers 
looking to buy some traveler's checks arrived at the bank shortly before noon. 
As they stepped inside the lobby, the lights were on but something was missing: 
There were no employees. The computers were turned off and the typewriters were 
covered. The vault door was shut. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the eerie quiet, the two men thought there might be tellers tied up 
by robbers behind the counters, but found no one there. They yelled, but no one 
answered. They jumped up and down in front of the security cameras, but no one 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Hollywood and I started to think we were on 'Candid Camera,' " said 
Brad Hahn, one of the two men who discovered business was not as usual at the 
bank. "But nobody jumped out and said, 'Gotcha!' " 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the pair telephoned Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, who arrived 
45 minutes later. It appeared that employees or janitors had left and forgot to 
lock the doors, said Sheriff's Deputy Dave Osman. The bank officially closed 
for the weekend at 6 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday afternoon, a Pinkerton security guard wearing a San Francisco 
Giants baseball cap showed up and said everything inside the bank was fine, the 
vault was locked, and nothing was missing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we find small shop owners forget to lock their doors," Osman said. 
"But it's pretty rare to find a bank open like this." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, 26, and his buddy, Max McBeth, 32, both of Los Angeles, said they first 
went to another branch of City National Bank in Beverly Hills to purchase 
traveler's checks for an upcoming trip. That branch was closed, but a security 
guard told them the City National branch on Sunset was open. 
</P>
<P>
And it was -- much to the surprise of the two men, who waited for police in big 
easy chairs in the loan department. At one point, Hahn said he answered a call 
from another bank asking to verify funds in a savings account. 
</P>
<P>
"After we got over our initial shock, it was funny," Hahn said. "Two guys in 
shorts and tank T-shirts sitting in a large empty bank." 
</P>
<P>
City National Bank officials could not be reached for comment. But as the 
Pinkerton guard relocked the bank doors, he said: "Come back Monday when we 
reopen. I'm sure somebody will have a lot to say then."

A 4-year-old Buenaventura, Mexico, boy who was minutes away from a liver 
transplant died before surgeons in Dallas could begin the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and physicians at Children's Medical Center had been elated but anxious 
when they learned Friday that a liver had been found for Sammy Aguirre, but 
doctors said the boy's condition had seriously deteriorated. The donated liver 
came from a Florida child who was slightly larger than Sammy, said Sammy's 
doctor, Dr. Troy Reyna. The organ was sent to another liver transplant patient, 
hospital spokeswoman Sylvia Bodell said.

Former Atty. Gen. Francis X. Bellotti won the endorsement for governor at the 
state Democratic convention in Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Boston University President John Silber, a maverick with growing popular 
support, won a spot in the primary. Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy also locked up a 
spot in September's primary with a second-place finish in voting by delegates. 
State Rep. John Flood was eliminated. The 5,000 delegates gave Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis' farewell speech a standing ovation. The 1988 Democratic presidential 
candidate urged the party to stick by its agenda of affordable housing, 
environmental protection, universal health care and job training.

Candy sales increased suddenly after children got hold of thousands of dollars 
in cash that a girl brought to school after finding the money buried in a barn. 
"We've got an officer working full-time to get some of the money back," 
Clearlake Police Lt. Bob Chalk said Friday of the $7,500 still missing. 
</P>
<P>
"But some of the money has already been spent at the Frosty Freeze and the 
grocery store. They're buying candy. We really don't expect to get much more 
money back, but it might be found yet." The 10-year-old girl, who police didn't 
identify, brought a $10,000 packet of $20, $50 and $100 bills to Oak Hill 
Middle School on Thursday. The money was part of $40,000 that a 52-year-old 
Clearlake man had buried in a metal box in his barn, where he'd kept his 
savings for about 20 years. The man doesn't plan to press charges against any 
of the children, according to police, who were keeping his identity a secret. 
They said he blames himself for his misfortune. Children in town apparently saw 
the man bury something in his barn and grew curious about what they would find, 
police said. Sue Daly, principal of the middle school, said students continued 
turning in money on Friday and things were mostly back to normal on campus. 
Daly said lunch time was disrupted on Thursday when the money the girl had 
brought to school began circulating on school grounds and some parents came to 
campus as cash swirled around.

Two police captains implicated in a 1986 men's room spying incident have been 
exonerated in a disciplinary arbitration, an attorney said Friday. Arbiter 
Emily Maloney ruled that captains Robert Evans and Wayne Novinger are to be 
compensated for lost wages and loss of seniority resulting from disciplinary 
actions against them, Gary Lepper, an attorney defending the pair in a federal 
lawsuit brought by their co-workers, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and Novinger were suspended without pay in the summer of 1989 by the city 
manager after a three-month investigation. The probe was conducted after 
charges were made that a video camera was installed in the department bathroom 
to spy on officers using the urinal. The surveillance was part of then-Police 
Chief George Straka's unsuccessful attempt to catch a vandal who had been 
clogging the urinal with paper towels and flooding offices. More than 30 
current and former city employees have sued the city, Straka, Lt. James 
Jennings and the two captains in federal court, claiming their civil rights 
were violated.

<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts 
(Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek San Francisco burglar who falls for a 
high-tech interior designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her 
stolen diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an 
all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), whose sons (Corey Haim, 
Christopher Collet), ages 10 and 15 respectively, view with increasing horror. 
</P>
<P>
The deft and amusing Back to the Beach (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
imagines that Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" 
movies of the early '60s got married and settled down in Ohio where Frankie has 
become a workaholic champion car salesman and Annette a model housewife and 
mother; what gets them back to Malibu is a visit to their daughter. The film is 
nostalgic without being embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or 
cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty 
Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis 
as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice 
Hitchcock touches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Beyond the Stars (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon 
with a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of 
the most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love 
triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere, 
Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious 
70mm camerawork. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidnapping of the President (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980 
theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a 
U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director 
William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to 
disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Elia Kazan's unforgettable 1955 film of John Steinbeck's East of Eden (Channel 
13 Friday at 8 p.m.) stars James Dean as the tormented Salinas Valley youth 
with a stern father (Raymond Massey) and a mother (Jo Van Fleet) who turns out 
to be the local hard-bitten madam. 
</P>
<P>
A Special Day (Channel 28 Saturday at 10:40 p.m.), Ettore Scola's stunning 1977 
film of strong contemporary implications, teams Sophia Loren as weary, 
oppressed Roman housewife and mother of six and Marcello Mastroianni as a 
homosexual threatened with imminent deporation to a concentration camp who meet 
during Hitler's triumphant procession through Rome on May 6, 1938.

Madame Sousatzka (Showtime Sunday at 10 a.m., again at 11:30 p.m., Thursday at 
noon; TMC Wednesday at noon): With this engaging 1988 film, Shirley MacLaine 
made her big move into grande dame territory as an imperious but lonely and 
frustrated London piano teacher. (2:01) 
</P>
<P>
Gallipoli (Channel 13 Monday at 10 a.m.): In Peter Weir's sweeping 1981 
production the bloody, treacherous World War I battle on Turkey's Gallipoli 
Peninsula represents an appointment with destiny, an end of innocence for his 
young heroes (Mark Lee, Mel Gibson) and for Australia as well. Edited (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (Bravo Monday at 8 p.m., again at 1 a.m.): 
This splendid 1971 film, a poignant, ill-fated romance illuminating the tragic 
plight of Italy's Jews under Mussolini, returned director Vittorio De Sicacq to 
top form after a decade of dismal pictures. With Dominique Sanda. (1:35) 
</P>
<P>
The Diary of Anne Frank (AMC Tuesday at 10:30 p.m.): George Stevens' 1959 film 
stands the test of time magnificently. It is the story of an exceptional 
individual (beautifully played by Millie Perkins) coming of age and the study 
of eight people forced into hiding but determined to hold on to their dignity.

The Temptations, fresh off an appearance on the season finale of "Murphy 
Brown," will hook up with CBS once again when they perform a revamped version 
of their classic Motown hit "Get Ready," to be used in the network's new fall 
promotional campaign. The tune will be featured in TV and radio spots beginning 
this summer.

Joanna Kerns has been cast as a housewife who is emotionally and sexually 
abused by her psychiatrist in the ABC movie "Nowhere Safe." The film is a 
fictional account based on real-life facts extracted from a number of 
litigations that have taken place across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Production has begun in Los Angeles on the six-hour NBC miniseries "Jackie 
Collins' Lucky," starring Nicollette Sheridan and Vince Irizarry in a story of 
passion, power and greed. The miniseries is scheduled to be telecast in October 
as part of NBC's strategy for counter-programming this year's baseball playoffs 
on CBS. Anne-Marie Johnson, Michael Nader, Mary Frann, Stephanie Beacham, Leann 
Hunley and Eric Braeden also star.

"The Arsenio Hall Show," trying to stay on the cutting edge, recently began 
broadcasting in Dolby Surround sound stereo -- a high-tech sound processing 
system that splits signals into four channels to create a concert-like 
ambience. "Television viewers whose homes are equipped with Surround sound 
receivers will feel as if they are part of the audience," producer Marla Kell 
Brown said.

COVER STORY: NIGHTMARISH 'TALES' TURNS INTO A DIRECTOR'S DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Daniel Cerone

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the kind of playground you dreamed of as a kid. A dark menagerie of 
graveyard tombstones, a mist-shrouded bog, a padded white-walled insane asylum, 
a dank stony dungeon oozing moss, dripping razor-sharp stalactites. All lurking 
inside the brick bowels of a faded spaghetti factory somewhere in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
They call it the Crypt. But it's really an amusement park, an E-ticket chill 
ride that's attracting a funeral procession of big Hollywood names. In between 
feature films, they head for the Crypt with a squeal on their lips and a tong 
in their heart. They're given about $900,000 by Home Box Office and allowed a 
week to roam the grounds and scare up some fun. All they have to do, in return, 
is direct a half-hour episode of "Tales From the Crypt," HBO's horror anthology 
series that airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spielberg, Penny Marshall, Tim Burton, Blake Edwards, Kathryn Bigelow, 
John McTiernan, Joe Dante -- film directors who make powerful executives stand 
in line for their services -- have all expressed interest in a "Crypt" 
excursion if the series gets picked up for 40 new episodes next season. 
</P>
<P>
Screenwriters and superstar actors also are getting in on the act. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger already made his directorial debut in one of this season's 18 
episodes, and Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, Burt Reynolds and Peter Weller have 
said they want to follow in his over-sized footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
The cable TV freak show, now in mid-season stride, is hosted with an 
animatronic grimace by the rotting Crypt-Keeper. The series is based on the old 
E.C. Comics that were yanked from newsstands in the squeaky-clean 1950s after a 
U.S. Senate subcommittee essentially banned them for leading to the decline of 
American youth. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, "Crypt's" twisted tales are a hit with cable audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"The horror and suspense genre is a place where directors can have fun," 
explained co-producer William Teitler, who produced the popular syndicated TV 
series "Tales From the Darkside" from 1984-88. "But a lot of top directors at 
this point in their career wouldn't choose to do a horror film. This gives them 
a chance to work in that genre." 
</P>
<P>
"Your typical film takes two years, where this story will air in two months," 
said first-time film director James Simpson, a New York stage director. He was 
inside the Crypt recently shooting an episode starring Richard Thomas as a mad, 
murderous doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"Once this is finished, I don't have to worry about distributors or anything 
else," Simpson said. "It's just a great gig." 
</P>
<P>
The directors involved are not being lured into the shadowy world of horror by 
big-buck offers. They, along with the actors and everyone on the crew, draw 
scale wages. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Silver, who regularly produces theatrical blockbusters such as the "Lethal 
Weapon" films and "Die Hard," reopened E.C.'s dusty horror vaults several years 
ago when he bought screen rights to all 530 devilish tales. 
</P>
<P>
After aborted feature-film attempts with directors Walter Hill, Robert Zemeckis 
and Richard Donner at the helm, Silver finally took the property to HBO with 
the three directors as executive producers. If the producer couldn't make one 
big theatrical film, he figured he would make a bunch of small ones that 
showcased Hollywood's finest directing talent. He would subsidize the unusually 
high budgets by selling the series in overseas markets and packaging them as 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
Because "Crypt" is on cable TV and not subject to network standards and 
practices, the directors have a regular monster mash on the set, where they 
express their humor in a jugular vein. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a really free experience," said Howard Deutch, who has directed two 
"Crypt" episodes. "I mean, having done three (feature) films, I can tell you 
that this is totally no holds barred. There's a big support system. They've 
arranged it so there's a net there, and they let you fly out as far as you can 
go. It's some pretty weird, sick stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"I just did an episode with Don Rickles and Bobcat Goldthwait," Donner said, 
"and I got to tell you, I hated when it ended. It was something I never could 
have done as a motion picture, and never could have done on network television. 
They cut each other's heads off; body parts fly. It was a charming show." 
</P>
<P>
William Gaines is the impish man who made creepy comics a staple in 1950, when 
he unleashed his E.C. Comic horror series -- Tales From the Crypt, Vault of 
Horror and Haunt of Fear. He reluctantly laid his horror yarns to rest in 1955, 
however, over public outcry. "It's hard to believe what was going on then," he 
said. "It was like a witch hunt. The federal government was trying to tie comic 
books to juvenile delinquency. Comics in general were the target, but I was the 
bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very painful to close down the magazines. I loved all my titles. But I 
figured that was the end of them." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines, now 68, lives in Manhattan where he works on another of his irreverent 
creations, Mad magazine, which also started as an E.C. Comic. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines never planned on a comic-book life. His father created the children's 
comics Tiny Tot, Animal Fables and Moon Girl in the '30s. They were published 
under the E.C. banner, which stood for Educational Comics. At the time, Gaines 
was studying to be a chemistry teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, his father died and Gaines took over the business. "I had no interest 
in children's comics," he said. "So I decided to publish comics along the lines 
of the stuff I loved as a kid, which were pulp magazines." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines and his editor, Al Feldstein, started cranking out horror, crime, 
suspense, adventure and science-fiction stories. With titles such as Weird 
Science, Frontline Combat and Crime Suspenstories and the horror comics, Gaines 
quickly renamed E.C. from Educational Comics to Entertaining Comics. 
</P>
<P>
E.C. Comics disappeared for about 20 years before Russ Cochran, a former 
college professor living in West Plains, Mo., started reprinting them in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the HBO series, Silver is adapting the E.C. Comic Two-Fisted 
Tales into a new action-adventure series for Fox Television. Like a proud 
father surveying his grown children, Gaines sits back in his Mad magazine 
offices and, sometimes, longs for the days when his comic creations were still 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the good days for me," he said. "Here at Mad I'm just a 
businessman. I have a whole editorial staff 100 times funnier than I am, so I'm 
reduced to being a businessman. But in those days, I was right in the thick of 
it."

Oliver Stone's 1988 film makes you laugh, makes you mad and keeps you on edge 
watching for the killers in the shadows. Eric Bogosian stars in this savagely 
audacious movie of his play that is a dip into the dangerous games played 
between a performer and his audience, a society and its malcontents and the 
medium of radio and the faceless voices it broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian's baiting call-in host offers listeners a stream of vituperation, 
abuse and wild sarcasm.

David Mamet's coldly absorbing, 1987 romantic thriller is almost as dry as

desire and curiosity into the con games of the oily and smoothly antagonistic 
Mike (Joe Mantegna).

Steven Bauer is wasted in the silly, old-fashioned 1984 Thief of Hearts (KCOP, 
Sunday at 6 p.m.) as a sleek burglar who falls for a high-tech interior 
designer (Barbara Williams) when he reads the drivel in her stolen diaries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Apted's well-made but thin 1984 Firstborn (KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m.) 
finds Teri Garr's vulnerable, well-fixed divorcee falling for an 
all-too-obviously dangerous loser (Peter Weller), viewed by Garr's sons with 
increasing horror. 
</P>
<P>
Sunburn (KTTV, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) finds Charles Grodin as a cocky, nebbish 
insurance investigator looking into a death in Acapulco and renting Farrah 
Fawcett to cover as his wife. Sloppy, witless, forced, characterless. 
</P>
<P>
The deft Back to the Beach (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) imagines that Annette 
Funicello and Frankie Avalon of all those "Beach Party" movies of the early 
U60s got married and settled down in Ohio. The film is nostalgic without being 
embarrassing and knowing without being either cruel or cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Franklin's 1981 Road Games (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty 
Australian thriller starring Stacy Keach as a truck driver and Jamie Lee Curtis 
as a hitchhiker who are pursued by a killer across a vast desert. Nice 
Hitchcock touches along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Battle Beyond the Stars (KTTV, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a "Star Wars" carbon with 
a "Seven Samurai" plot; cut-rate but blessed by a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Malick's 1978 Days of Heaven (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is one of the 
most beautiful color films ever made, a poetic turn-of-the-century love 
triangle set against a wheat harvest in the Midwest and involving Richard Gere, 
Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard. Nestor Almendros won an Oscar for his glorious 
70mm camerawork. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidnapping of the President (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), a not-bad 1980 
theatrical production that was sold directly to TV, stars Hal Holbrook as a 
U.S. President who fails to heed the warning of Secret Service deputy director 
William Shatner that a group of South American terrorists may be planning to 
disrupt his visit to Canada. With Van Johnson and Ava Gardner.

hard-bitten madam. With Julie Harris.

Recorded live at Copenhagen's Montmartre club in 1988, "Fleur" moves away from 
Bley's recent and somewhat predictable group efforts ("Night-glo," "Sextet") 
back to more ambitious territory. Here, the composer/arranger/keyboardist has 
her 15-piece ensemble create backdrops -- steamy, rhythmic jungles, downtown 
traffic jams heavy with horns and animated scenes of cocktail chatter -- while 
alloting generous chunks of improvisational space. Though some of the solos 
sound a bit belligerent for Bley's well-considered themes, good individual 
efforts abound: Trumpeter Lew Soloff displays strong logic on the title cut 
while Bley-mate and bassist Steve Swallow shows off melodic smarts on "Healing 
Power." BILL KOHLHAASE

This is part of "Beats of the Heart," English filmmaker Jeremy Marre's 14-part 
series that was filmed about 10 years ago and promises far more than it 
delivers. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary aims for a street-level perspective on border culture and music 
but suffers from an intrusive, banal narration. Visually, "Tex-Mex" amounts to 
little more than voyeuristic sketches that jump from subject to subject so 
arbitrarily that the handful of insightful segments seem to have slipped in by 
accident. The biggest beef: constant declarations that the music reflects 
social concerns and issues, but no translations of the lyrics for 
non-Spanish-speaking viewers. DON SNOWDEN

Joel is at his worst when he's on a social-consciousness kick. 
</P>
<P>
On four of the five videos in this 25-minute collection, including "Leningrad," 
"We Didn't Start the Fire" and two versions of "The Downeaster," he's raising 
our consciousness about something or other. Joel comes across as very 
in-sincere -- just another millionaire rock star on a crusade. Like these songs 
-- from his recent hit album "Storm Front" -- the videos are saturated with 
sentimentality and melodramatic excesses. Only the joyous "I Go to Extremes" 
isn't tainted by a social message. Joel's music and videos are more likeable 
when he's just having fun, crooning about nothing deeper than the trials of 
romance and everyday life. DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 CONCRETE BLONDE "BLOODLETTING" I.R.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A worthy successor to X as L.A.'s best alternative rock band, Concrete Blonde 
has always indulged in a similarly harrowing mix of faith and despair, set 
apart from the rest of the black-clad local pack by a determined refusal to 
give in to the latter. Johnette Napolitano sang George Harrison's "Beware of 
Darkness" on the band's '87 debut and seemed to mean it. 
</P>
<P>
On this third album, though, which is probably their least commercial package, 
there's a disquieting sense of succumbing. 
</P>
<P>
The titles tell a lot: "The Sky Is a Poisonous Garden," "Darkening of the 
Light," "The Beast." Here, "Love is the killer you thought was your friend," or 
worse; in the title song, an old neck wound from a long-departed lover leaves 
Napolitano wandering among the walking dead, and salvation seems even more 
remote. The haunting, gorgeous "Tomorrow, Wendy," written by Andy Prieboy, ends 
the album with the most bleak evocation of impending death possible. 
</P>
<P>
The music, too, has taken a less frenzied turn, with more layered vocals and 
the absence of recently departed Harry Rushakoff's Keith Moon-style drum licks. 
But the feistiness is far from gone; even in her most melancholy mode, 
Napolitano still sounds like a fighter. And in "Joey," the one sort of hopeful, 
lilting, Pretenders-like tune, the band might have a shot at a hit. This 
"Bloodletting" is indeed dripping, and gripping, stuff. Chris Willman

POP FACES: STEVE WYNN BREAKS OUT OF THE SYNDICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dream Syndicate was never quite the Los Angeles institution that, say, the 
Dodgers are. But the band was a seminal force in the city's '80s underground 
rock evolution. 
</P>
<P>
So now that Dream Syndicate leader Steve Wynn has gone solo, he's faced with 
having to redefine himself, at least musically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the main reason I went solo," Wynn said, pondering the Dodger analogy 
while taking in a recent game at the Stadium. "It's not so much redefining but 
undefining. With Dream Syndicate, I had to stay with two-guitars-bass-drums and 
with this I could break out of that." 
</P>
<P>
This is "Kerosene Man," Wynn's solo debut album, released recently by Rhino 
Records. On the album, Wynn tries some of the directions he'd only hinted at 
from within the Syndicate's format. 
</P>
<P>
The first two songs, "Tears Won't Help" and "Carolyn," are accented by a cello 
that evokes images of both Van Morrison's Caledonia soul and the baroque-pop 
'60s group the Left Banke. Several other songs have a late-night jazz feel via 
saxophone contributions by Steve Berlin. And "Conspiracy of the Heart," a 
torchy duet with Concrete Blonde's Johnette Napolitano, explores territory 
pretty much new to Wynn on record. 
</P>
<P>
The break with the past is hardly complete: Wynn's new band includes Dream 
Syndicate bassist Mark Walton and performs several of the old group's numbers 
in its live set (Wynn and band will be at the Sunset in Sierra Madre on 
Wednesday, Bogart's on Thursday and Club Lingerie on Friday). But it has 
afforded Wynn the opportunity to reexamine the role he played in the past in 
Los Angeles rock and the role he'd like to play now. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the second wave of punk rock," he said of the Dream Syndicate, which 
was influenced by the Velvet Underground and Neil Young. "By the times things 
had gotten jaded in punk we were the ones who were new and hadn't been any part 
of a scene and that helped open things up. A lot of good bands came out of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Lately Wynn has found that the influence went far beyond Los Angeles. 
</P>

DOUBLE TROUBLE: How's this for a super-session? Texas' hottest guitar slinger 
Stevie Ray Vaughan is making an album with an equally incomparable guitar wiz . 
. . his brother Jimmy, who handles the ax chores for the Fabulous Thunderbirds. 
The siblings have been working in Memphis with (of all people) Nile Rodgers, 
who is producing the record for a late summer release. . . . Meanwhile, two 
guys who were double trouble -- at least if you put them in the same room 
together -- have cooled their jets and buried the hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
We refer to rappers Kool Moe D and LL Cool J, who have signed a peace treaty 
(at least temporarily) and been hanging out together, all smiles, after years 
of bad blood and dissing matches. . . . Reggae-rapper Shinehead has a new album 
due out in early July called "The Real Rock." It features a slinky cover of 
Sly's "Family Affair," plus originals like "Cigarette Breath," "Musical 
Madness" and "Love &amp; Marriage Rap." . . . And "After the Rain," due later 
this month from DGC Records, is the debut album from Nelson, the band formed by 
Matthew and Gunnar Nelson, sons of the late Rick Nelson. Titled "After the 
Rain," the album is dedicated to Rick and features such songs as "Love and 
Affection," "I Can Hardly Wait" and "Tracy's Song."

POP EYE: RAFFI USES HIS KIDDIE CLOUT TO RAP CD WRAPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Here's a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
With such politically correct pop activists as Sting, Peter Gabriel, Jackson 
Browne and the B-52's doing environmental benefits (and Midnight Oil's Peter 
Garrett actually playing a protest concert outside Exxon's New York 
headquarters this week), guess who's the first platinum-selling performer to 
actually make his record label junk the unwieldy, wildly unpopular long CD 
boxes that have become an industrywide ecological embarrassment? 
</P>
<P>
Are you ready for . . . Raffi? 
</P>
<P>
That's right. The soft-spoken Canadian singer, who's sold millions of albums 
aimed at pre-school children, signed a new contract with MCA Records last 
month, but only after the label agreed that it wouldn't "release cassettes or 
CDs in a long box or other excessive packaging." MCA execs believe it's the 
first time a major artist has ever put such specific anti-long box language in 
a record contract. 
</P>
<P>
"This really makes him the icebreaker," said Island Records president Mike 
Bone, an outspoken environmental activist and CD long-box foe. "He may be a 
children's artist, but his records go platinum too. It's a big move. Hopefully, 
once someone takes a stand and shows that getting rid of the long box won't 
hurt their record sales, it'll give other artists the leverage to say, 'Hey, I 
want to do it too.' " 
</P>
<P>
When MCA vice president of marketing Jeff Bywater heard that Raffi was leaving 
A&amp;M Records and had recorded an album about environmental themes, he 
organized a lunch between the toddler idol and the MCA brass. He also had an 
ace up his sleeve -- he invited Garrett De Bell, MCA's resident ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
"I think having our ecologist at the table sent a clear message to Raffi that 
we were willing to do the job -- and had the consciousness level to do it," 
Bywater said. "Big corporations rarely get credit for being in the vanguard of 
positive environmental statements. 
</P>
<P>
"But this company has made a real across-the-board effort. I recycle all my 
memos in a separate box for paper, and have another box by the refrigerator for 
plastic cans and bottles. Everyone at the label does it. Our Styrofoam and 
plastic is all gone." 
</P>
<P>
Bywater said that when he took Raffi's contract to MCA Music Entertainment 
Group Chairman Al Teller, he reminded him about the no-long box dictum. "Al 
said, 'I'm in.' " Bywater explained. "He was willing to roll the dice. Raffi 
and his manager, Linda Goldstein, know it could have an effect on their sales. 
But it's an important issue and you've got to start somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, Raffi said: "I simply believe that the excessive 
packaging of cassettes and CDs can no longer be tolerated in a global 
environmental crisis. If there's enough pressure from artists and their 
audience, the buying public, I think record stores wil respond by eliminating 
the long box." 
</P>
<P>
MCA's big challenge will be convincing record store owners, who are adamantly 
opposed to jettisoning the long box, to carry Raffi's tapes and CDs when his 
record, "Evergreen Everblue," is released this fall. Retailers have scorned 
proposals to switch over to different-sized display shelving (known in the 
industry as fixtures), saying the transition would cost record-store chains 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously going to take a lot of discussions between record companies and 
retailers," said Bywater, who acknowledged that MCA still plans to distribute 
"some" Raffi tapes and CDs with recycled cardboard displays. "We're going to 
try to come up with some imaginative solutions to the dilemma by the time 
Raffi's album is released. This is just a first step, but at least it's a step 
in the right direction."

SHOP TALK: Let's talk corporate synergy. Giant Records mogul Irving Azoff liked 
Aussie band Boom Crash Opera so much that he convinced Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Records, which distributes Azoff's new label, to let him have the group's new 
album as his debut Giant release. Actually the record, titled "These Here Are 
Hard Times" and due out June 12, is being issued under a one-time-only 
Giant/Warner logo, in recognition of Warner's initial involvement with the 
band. . . . Warrant is finishing up its new album, due later this summer. New 
tunes include "I See Red," "Love in Stereo" and "Uncle Tom's Cabin." . . . 
Ex-Prince proteges Wendy &amp; Lisa, after going nowhere at Columbia Records, 
have signed with Virgin. Expect a new album later this summer. . . . Anita 
Baker is back in July with a new album called "Compositions," which features 
pop fare like "More Than You Know," "Soul Inspiration" and "Love You to the 
Letter." . . . And our '70s Funk Flashback of the Week goes to Peppers, the 
dance club located in City of Industry, which recently featured Tower of Power 
and has the Ohio Players coming next Sunday and Kool &amp; the Gang due June 
24.

ART FOR RENT IN MUSEUM'S BARGAIN BASEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
A LACMA GALLERY HELPS STRUGGLING ARTISTS BY MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR 
PEOPLE TO RENT OR BUY THEIR ORIGINAL WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every week people walk out of the basement of the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art with original pieces of contemporary art -- and security does nothing to 
stop them. Some will keep the works in their homes or offices for months; 
others will keep them permanently. 
</P>
<P>
Don't sound the alarm. It's all the work of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, a 
little-known showcase hidden away under the museum's Anderson Building, a place 
better known for its cafeteria. Created almost 30 years ago as part of the Arts 
Museum Council, this busy office and gallery displays, rents and sells 
contemporary art created by more than 250 Los Angeles-area artists it 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
"We are expanding the art base of the city by showing all kinds of the people 
in Los Angeles that it's possible to support contemporary art," said Terri 
Smooke, current director of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery. "We're showing 
people how to live with art." 
</P>
<P>
Acting as an independent gallery within the museum, the gallery has three 
goals: exposing emerging artists, making original art more affordable to the 
general public and raising money for the county museum's acquisitions fund. The 
gallery organizes five exhibits each year, showcasing the work of five artists 
each time. Each exhibit hangs for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unimpressive amount of space -- the program occupies a basement 
hallway, where exhibits hang, and one small office -- Smooke said the gallery 
brings in more than $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Smooke and the rest of her all-volunteer staff stress the importance of 
launching new talent into the L.A. art world. The Art Rental and Sales Gallery 
often provides the best option for struggling artists. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept only those artists who are not part of the formal gallery system," 
or don't have any official representation, said Smooke, adding that many of the 
artists who are chosen have eventually been picked up by established galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Besides giving much-needed exposure to little-known talents, the gallery also 
presents an opportunity for the beginning collector. With rental prices ranging 
from $15 to $110 for two months (works can be rented only on a bimonthly 
basis), museum members of almost any income range can afford to take home an 
original work. Non-members can purchase pieces outright, but cannot rent. All 
they have to do is walk into the office and ask to see what's available. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking the American system here," Smooke said. "Our work isn't priced 
like David Hockney and Frank Stella. Almost any person can rent art and keep it 
for as long as they would like, or ultimately purchase the art because the 
payments apply to the purchase." 
</P>
<P>
According to Smooke, the renters come from all age groups and backgrounds, with 
the only common denominator being museum membership and a desire to experiment 
with art. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people see something in a show and they fall in love with it. Others 
simply want to make their living or work spaces more attractive. They want to 
enrich their surroundings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our niche in the community is to try and help those people who aren't in the 
regular art market yet," said Susan Franklin, co-chairman of the five-member 
Exhibitions Committee of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, the group that 
chooses the artists who appear in the gallery shows. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because it is under the aegis of the county museum, the gallery is able 
to pay 75% of the rental and purchase fee directly to the artists. The gallery 
keeps the other 25%. So besides having their work see the light of day, new 
artists can also reap immediate financial benefits from the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's brought me a regular check every month," says artist Stuart Saks, who was 
part of a show last spring and currently has eight pieces on rent. "It's a 
wonderful program. It's an entry-level process for beginning artists." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Sievers had her work displayed in a show that ran in February and says 
that money isn't the only benefit of participating in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"People see the announcement, and they say, 'Gosh, the county museum. How 
wonderful!' They don't think of it based in a hallway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers, who saw four of her five paintings on aluminum rented the first night 
of her show, sees an added advantage in the location of the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of people, all the collectors, go down to the basement because 
that's where the curators and all the office personnel are," Sievers said. 
"Some big-time art dealers will see your work down there." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is divided into three separate areas that work together to choose, 
store and distribute the art. The Exhibitions Committee handles submissions by 
artists and refers artists to the Rental Division. This division actually 
processes the rental art from the tiny office where as many as 150 pieces are 
stored. 
</P>
<P>
The third area, the Corporate Division, rents art to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Exhibition is really the center, the heart of this program," Smooke said. 
"That's where we get our credibility in the artists' community because they 
understand that this is a serious gallery. It's not just a money-making 
venture." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin and her co-chairman Nancy Freedman look for artists doing something 
novel. "We are looking for artists who are doing something different, something 
we haven't seen before, maybe a little bit on the cutting edge. We are 
interested in serious work, art that may be a little bit tough for people," 
says Franklin, who receives about eight to 10 submissions per week. "We don't 
want the kind of stuff you see at neighborhood sidewalk art shows. It's beyond 
craft." 
</P>
<P>
After the committee members decide which applicants interest them, they make 
studio visits. Sometimes they return two or three times before choosing an 
artist for a show. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to put together a mixture. We show photography, dimensional work, 
abstract work -- a real eclectic mix," Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Franklin, who is in her second year of heading the committee (the 
council alternates chairmanships every two years), positions on the Exhibitions 
Committee are the most coveted in the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, mostly 
because its members are the bearers of good news. 
</P>
<P>
"When you call the artists and tell them they've been accepted, it's a little 
bit like that old TV show, 'The Millionaires,' " Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
But even an artist's works that are considered unsuitable for exhibition are 
often passed down to the Rental Division. Doris Gamson, who heads the Rental 
Division, says the goal is to collect a variety of high-quality art that still 
maintains a wide appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep an artist's work on hand for five years. We hope that after five 
years, they'll be a little more self-sufficient," Gamson said. 
</P>
<P>
The more work the better, said Gamson, who sees more renters now than ever. 
Currently there are about 450 people who rent art from the gallery. "We're 
getting more popular lately. An average of about 15 to 20 renters a week come 
in to look at the art. Before holidays, we have them lined up waiting to get 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The Corporate Division operates much like the Rental Division, except the 
corporate renters are required to keep work for six-month increments, and at 
least one employee of the corporation must be a museum member. For a $100 
consultation fee -- which is credited as a donation to the museum -- a 
representative of the Corporate Division will advise the company on how to best 
utilize its space. 
</P>
<P>
At any given time, the Corporate Division is working with a minimum of 50 
companies, Gamson said. "And that can range from five pieces to 50 pieces per 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Gamson estimated that 20% of all renters end up purchasing the works, but most 
return the art after the initial two months. 
</P>
<P>
"You might get somebody that picks something that they think they're mad about 
today, and in two months they'll change their minds," Gamson said. "Our biggest 
individual renter has 60 pieces out now. He sees so many he likes here in the 
office, but then they'll end up under his bed. Every once in a while he'll 
bring one of them back." 
</P>
<P>
It's this luxury of relatively painless financial risk that attracts a lot of 
inexperienced art lovers into starting collections. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Larry Layne, a San Fernando Valley real estate developer, considered 
purchasing art, but with an educational background in business and science, he 
felt ill-equipped to deal directly with galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the concept of walking into a gallery intimidating," said Layne. "I 
didn't want to take a financial gamble on something I didn't feel comfortable 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Layne rented his first piece from the Art Rental and Sales 
Gallery. Today he has 30 rented works hanging in his office and his Marina del 
Rey home. He has purchased four. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned how I felt about art and how long a piece would own my interest," 
Layne said. "I've learned a lot about art criticism from the staff at the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows how long it would have taken me to feel comfortable buying art?"

When I placed a telephone order May 15 for four $50 tickets for "Aida," the 
order taker at a major ticket agency knew enough at that date to state that if 
the show were cancelled, handling charges of $23.50 would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 12 hours later, the cancellation of the operatic spectacular at the 
Los Angeles Coliseum was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say 5,000 tickets sold, each with an additional fee of about $6. Six 
times 5,000 equals $30,000: a good deal for someone?

After reading Philips' article, I have a simple solution that doesn't involve

at least lowering their profits. It's done throughout Europe.

MADONNA: ONE STEP OVER THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am 23 years old and have been a Madonna fan since she first arrived on the 
scene, but after having seen her recent "Blond Ambition" tour in Los Angeles, I 
am outraged. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna has always been known for her image of sexual promiscuity; however, in 
her current tour she has managed to step over the line between sexually 
suggestive and sexually explicit. 
</P>
<P>
I am concerned about the 10-year-old girls who idolize Madonna and use her as a 
role model. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that the public has a right to be forewarned of explicit sexual acts 
that take place at concerts such as Madonna's. It seems strange to me that you 
must be 17 to enter an R-rated movie, yet a child can walk into a Madonna 
concert and see her have simulated intercourse with her bed.

In Chuck Philips' "Why Does a $30 Ticket Become a $600 Ticket?" (May 27), Brian 
Harlig, president of the California Assn. of Ticket Agencies and owner of Good 
Time Tickets, defends the huge markups that brokers take on concert and theater 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "Regulating free enterprise is a ludicrous idea" and, later: "People 
are not being forced to give money to ticket agencies. Nobody is holding a gun 
to their head. They pay us because they like the service we provide." 
</P>
<P>
This sounds similar to something Al Capone once said: "We provided a product, 
and people liked it."

AQMD PUTS LIMITS ON TOXIC INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that toxics in the air are threatening public health, the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District on Friday approved controversial new limits on 
industrial emissions of 11 cancer-causing air contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule, which takes effect immediately, requires all new and existing 
businesses that expand or relocate within the region to comply with the new 
limits or be denied a permit to operate equipment that produces the pollution. 
The AQMD estimates about 250 businesses a year would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is evidence that the district, which once focused only on fighting 
smog, is beginning to move more forcefully into new areas to improve air 
quality. In the past, many air toxics that may have posed a health threat were 
not regulated because they did not contribute to the formation of smog. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new standard, the risk to the community of developing cancer from any 
of the 11 targeted contaminants must not exceed 10 in 1 million. The health 
risk is based on constant exposure over a 70-year lifetime. Businesses would 
have to show their ability to comply before any new pollution producing 
equipment is used. Denials would be based on computer projections of 
anticipated emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The types of businesses most likely to be affected by the new rule include 
gasoline stations, hospitals, dry cleaners and metal-treating and plating 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 targeted contaminants, benzene -- an ingredient in gasoline -- is the 
most prevalent. The second is hexavalent chromium, a microscopic particle 
produced in chrome plating and other metal treating operations. 
</P>
<P>
But in approving the rule on an 11-to-1 vote, the board gave companies five 
years to comply if needed emission control equipment has not been developed or 
is unobtainable. During the grace period, the allowable health risk from these 
businesses could be as high as 100 in a million -- 10 times greater than the 
new standard. 
</P>
<P>
The time extension was approved over the protests of board member Sabrina 
Schiller, who cast the only dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant weakening of an already weak regulation," said Schiller, 
who had argued for a much tighter health standard of 1 in 1 million. "It seems 
to go against everything the state and our federal government has attempted to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Chatten-Brown, president of the Coalition for Clean Air, complained that 
even with the new rule, regulation of air toxics remains "the one gaping hole 
in the program to protect the public health from air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"Our air basin is checkered with toxic hot spots," she said. "The district's 
failure to take appropriate action is a complete capitulation to industry and 
an abdication of their duty to the public." 
</P>
<P>
But board member Larry Berg, who proposed the five-year grace period after 
business representatives complained that a stricter time frame would discourage 
new businesses from locating here, rejected the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years ago I was treated for cancer (of the vocal chords) and three of my 
friends have lung cancer. I'm sensitive to this issue," Berg said. "I do not 
think (the extension) substantially weakens this rule. . . . It is painfully 
evident to me that we needed to do something or we won't pass (it)." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents told the board most companies would be 
able to comply with the stricter standard. He predicted that only two to three 
firms a year would apply for the grace period. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pressure-relief valve," Lents said of the grace period. "Only a few 
sources fall into this category. . . . We think (they) would not represent an 
overwhelming public exposure." 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, the AQMD has attempted to limit air toxics, but had no 
regulation to back up enforcement efforts and had little success. Most 
businesses, even when challenged by AQMD, were able to conduct business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Robert Wyman, who represents an industry coalition, 
applauded the regulation, noting that the five-year grace period satisfied 
their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really not talking about significant risk (differences)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the regulation was first discussed at a meeting two weeks ago, business 
interests and some board members worried that the proposed health risk of 10 in 
1 million was overly strict, would reduce cancer risks only slightly, and would 
impose unnecessary hardships on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to benzene and hexavalent chromium, other contaminants covered by 
the rule are asbestos, cadmium, carbon tetrachloride, chlorinated dioxins, 
dibenzofurans, ethylene dibromide, ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide and 
methylene chloride.

LANDMARK MISSILE PACT OUTLINED; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: GEORGE BUSH AND MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV ALSO SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SLASH 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS. THEY VOWED TO FINISH THE LONG-RANGE NUCLEAR MISSILE TREATY BY 
YEAR'S END. "THE COLD WAR MUST END," BUSH SAID.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev approved the outlines of a landmark 
treaty Friday for the first-ever cuts in long-range nuclear missiles and signed 
a pact to slash chemical weapons. "The world has waited long enough, the Cold 
War must end," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
In a major concession to Gorbachev, the two leaders signed a trade agreement 
that is politically important for the Soviet president, who is burdened by 
deepening economic problems at home. Also sealed was a five-year grain sale 
anxiously sought by American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the nuclear arms agreement was designed to "enhance stability and 
reduce the risk of war." It will require months of work to put the treaty in 
final form, but Gorbachev said he shared Bush's goal of signing it by year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Heralding the pact to cut stockpiles of poison gas, Bush said: "Let this 
landmark agreement quickly lead to a global ban on chemical weapons." 
Negotiations are under way among 40 nations for a worldwide treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making steps toward a new world," Gorbachev said. "The area of 
disagreement is being narrowed." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through a four-day summit, Bush and Gorbachev sat down at a gleaming 
mahogany table in the East Room to sign an array of agreements. The two men 
were flanked by Soviet and American flags. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev, who traveled together to Wellesley College 
earlier in the day, applauded their husbands' achievements from their front-row 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
They capped the day with a dinner honoring Bush at the Soviet embassy. The menu 
featured roast duck, suckling pig and baked fish, accompanied by the best wines 
of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The televised ceremony ended a day of suspense and last-minute bargaining, and 
stole the spotlight from disputes ranging from German unity, European security 
and reductions in conventional forces. The two men will talk again Saturday in 
the quiet surroundings of Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference later, Secretary of State James A. Baker III took note of 
"two areas where real disagreements do remain": Germany and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"While we did not narrow our differences on these two issues, we did heighten, 
I think, our understanding of each other's concerns," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
As the day unfolded, the two leaders hit snags in the outlines of the nuclear 
weapons pact and sent Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze 
into a harried round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was postponed as the leaders waited for an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Intent on wresting trade concessions from Bush, officials said Gorbachev 
stalled on the grain-sale agreement. In the end, they split their differences. 
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement is a step toward granting most-favored-nation status to 
Moscow, providing the lowest possible tariffs on Soviet goods. Baker said they 
would not even send the treaty paper work to the Senate for ratification until 
the Soviets enact a law protecting Jewish emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the major accords, the leaders signed agreements to improve 
verification of underground nuclear explosions under treaties dating from 1974 
and 1976. They also put their names on agreements for student exchanges and 
cooperation on atomic energy. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not agree on everything, but we agree on one great truth: The world has 
waited long enough, the Cold War must end," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to their storm-tossed meeting in Malta last December and the dramatic 
changes across Eastern Europe, Gorbachev said: "The turbulent developments in 
recent months after Malta have not led us astray from the goals we set 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he is committed to wrapping up the final elements of the nuclear 
weapons pact before the end of the year. Bush concurred. The final treaty will 
force both superpowers to cut their nuclear arsenals by about a third. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the two sides, after six days of intensive negotiations, had made 
"workman-like progress across the full spectrum" of nuclear weapons, including 
limits on heavy mobile intercontinental missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader put a premium on winning a trade agreement from Bush, saying 
it would be an important political prize for him. "We are not asking for a free 
ride," he told congressional leaders at the start of the day. He said it would 
be "humiliating" to beg for concessions. 
</P>
<P>
As a price for improved trade, the Bush Administration has demanded an easing 
of Soviet pressure against Lithuania, as well as passage of a Soviet law 
protecting Jewish emigration. In the end, Bush decided not to send Gorbachev 
home empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"They understand full well that they will not get (most-favored-nation 
benefits) until the legislation passes the Supreme Soviet," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted there was "no formal linkage" between the trade issue and 
Lithuania, although Bush has acknowledged it would be hard to get the Senate to 
approve a trade treaty as long as Moscow put pressure on the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical weapons accord imposes a halt in production of poison gas and 
requires the two nations to cut their stockpiles to 5,000 tons each. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev were unable to make progress on cutting troops and 
non-nuclear weapons in Europe. They issued a statement declaring their hope to 
reach agreement by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
On a related front, sources said Gorbachev, trying to break a stalemate, had 
proposed creation of a new "Council of all Europe" to play a decisive role in 
shaping the military future of Germany. The United States and the Soviet Union 
would participate in the deliberations along with other members of the NATO and 
Warsaw Pact alliances as well as neutral countries. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said: "We are prepared to work with it. It is not something we 
would reject out of hand." The idea will be considered by top diplomatic aides 
in Copenhagen and Berlin later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The superpower summit was spiced with colorful sideshows. Mrs. Bush and Mrs. 
Gorbachev were cheered at Wellesley College commencement exercises and 
Gorbachev once again stopped his entourage to work the noon-hour crowds on a 
brilliant sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
Both women spoke of traditional values at Wellesley. Mrs. Bush, whose selection 
as a graduation speaker had irritated some students, counseled them to put 
family and friends first in their lives. Mrs. Gorbachev said women have a 
special mission of "peacemaking, humanism, mercy and kindness." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev began the day by confronting some of his toughest critics in 
Washington -- congressional leaders unhappy over Moscow's coercion of 
Lithuania, the Baltic republic struggling for independence. Televised live 
across America, it was a freewheeling exchange over trade, German unity, 
Lithuania and Soviet economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev took the offensive. He said Bush was too rigid about insisting that a 
unified Germany be a member of NATO, and rejected any suggestion that he was 
politically weak. "That's not serious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a genuine revolution," Gorbachev told the lawmakers, some of whom have 
expressed doubts that he will survive. "Please don't be frightened, because you 
can frighten us, too, if you get frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Extolling his economic reforms, Gorbachev said increased trade with the West 
would be an important step toward a free market system in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev said: "I'm not going to ask for anything, to beg for 
anything. . . . Certainly we are not asking for a free ride. We will be asking 
for normal credits, and of course we will be paying, and paying the interest. 
For us it would humiliating if we were to ask, to beg for something from you." 
</P>
<P>
When congressmen pressed him on Lithuania, Gorbachev pointed out that China had 
received most-favored-nation status despite the bloody crackdown in Tian An Men 
Square a year ago. "Maybe we should introduce martial rule in the Baltics," he 
said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on strategic weapons, the deadliest arms in the superpowers' 
arsenals, has been under negotiation for eight years. It would be the first to 
reduce long-range nuclear arms; previous agreements set overall limits but 
still allowed more weapons to be made. 
</P>
<P>
Even after both sides initial a treaty outline, the superpowers will face 
months of tedious negotiations over details to satisfy lawyers in each country. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, both sides would agree to destroy about a third of their long-range 
nuclear weapons over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical weapons pact would require the United States to destroy about 
20,000 tons of its stockpile and mandate a 45,000-ton reduction by the Soviet 
Union. The United States also would be required to stop producing poison gas; 
the Soviet Union already has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the arms agreements, there also were accords expanding air travel 
between the United States and Soviet Union, increasing student exchanges, and 
making it easier for commercial ships to deliver goods to ports in one 
another's country. 
</P>
<P>
There was an agreement for closer cooperation on atomic energy and another to 
open reciprocal cultural and information centers in Washington and Moscow.

STOREFRONT CLINICS' CARE FACES SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of low-income immigrants are flocking to storefront medical clinics 
that have sprung up on street corners and in mini-malls throughout Southern 
California -- walk-in, cash-only facilities where the service is quick but the 
quality of care, authorities say, can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Most are legitimate operations that give the poor and working class access to 
medical attention they might not otherwise have. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities say an increasing number are unlicensed facilities where 
unqualified and overworked employees practice medicine illegally. 
</P>
<P>
They do a brisk business. One four-clinic chain, whose operators face trial for 
the unlicensed practice of medicine and related charges, was attending 1,000 
patients a week when police raided it last year. 
</P>
<P>
Through court records, medical investigators' reports and interviews with 
former employees and patients, a number of examples emerge of alleged illicit 
medicine at clinics frequented by immigrants: 
</P>
<P>
* A man previously convicted of illegally practicing medicine is accused of 
using his wife's license to treat scores of patients in Spanish-speaking 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
* A doctor schooled in Mexico but not authorized to practice in this country 
repeatedly failed a test that measures medical knowledge, yet was hired by 
clinics twice. 
</P>
<P>
* A doctor whose license was revoked in 1987 answered a newspaper ad and 
started attending patients in a clinic in the Westlake area, authorities said. 
His true status was revealed only by a chance encounter with a physician 
familiar with his history. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office says the number of bogus-clinic cases it 
has prosecuted has doubled since 1986, to about 12 last year. But many go 
undetected, and those that are shut down by police often reopen days later. 
</P>
<P>
"These clinics spring up not only in poverty neighborhoods but more in 
neighborhoods where there is an ethnic community, where people prefer to go to 
(doctors) of their own ethnic group," said Joan Jerzak, supervising special 
investigator for the Medical Board of California, which is empowered to 
investigate complaints about doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"People might not even know whether the doctor has a license," she said. "The 
doctor says he's a doctor, and they believe him. It's a man or a woman with a 
white coat and a stethoscope, who says 'doctor,' and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
A legal loophole in the state Health and Safety Code allows some clinics to 
fall into a gray area that is not closely monitored by any regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a clinic must be licensed by the state or, in the case of Los 
Angeles, by the county, whose agencies are in charge of regulating the 
facility. But a doctor can bypass the county by incorporating, obtaining a 
fictitious business permit from the Medical Board and using the term "clinic" 
to label his or her private practice. In those cases, the clinic is not subject 
to the same regulatory scrutiny that county-licensed clinics receive. 
</P>
<P>
And, in many cases, the doctor illegally fails to obtain the 
fictitious-business permit, meaning no agency at all is responsible for 
inspecting the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there were more scrutiny, officials say, bogus clinics are likely to 
flourish for other reasons. Their storefronts fade into their densely populated 
community, attracting little official attention. Their mostly immigrant 
patients -- many of them in this country illegally -- fear authorities and will 
not report poor medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics can tap quickly into a ready and huge clientele -- a pool of 
patients whose health-care options are already limited by poverty, illegal 
status, culture and mistrust. They are reluctant to go to government-run 
hospitals but eager to find practitioners who speak their language. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Leopoldo Torres, 40, is typical. Unable to take time off work to 
spend in the waiting rooms of county hospitals, he went to an East Los Angeles 
clinic that he had heard of through family word of mouth. They spoke Spanish 
there. He felt comfortable. He trusted. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Torres blames his partial blindness on the care he received at the 
unlicensed clinic. The personnel treated his symptoms, giving him vitamin shots 
and drugs, but ignored his diabetes, he says. Treatments sometimes cost $150 -- 
nearly half his weekly earnings as a food-truck vendor. 
</P>
<P>
He never suspected the clinic's "doctors" were unlicensed -- until police shut 
the facility last year. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you know?" Torres, a native of Mexico, asked in Spanish. "Supposedly, 
they were doctors. If I had known, I would not have gone. Going to a witch 
doctor would have been better." 
</P>
<P>
When health inspectors climbed a wide flight of stairs and walked into the 
second-floor offices of the Santa Ines Clinic, in the Westlake District near 
MacArthur Park, they found unlicensed workers examining urine specimens under a 
microscope and administering intravenous infusions, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
In one examination room lay an elderly Mexican woman with an IV tube attached 
to her arm; in another room sat a younger woman suffering from facial pains. 
</P>
<P>
In a third room sat a 14-year-old boy. The investigators asked the youth why he 
had come to the clinic, and he said he had "an infection." 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me a 2-centimeter broken skin area on his right wrist and stated 
that he also had a sore in the groin area," one of the inspectors, a registered 
nurse employed by the county Department of Health Services, reported in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him what caused this, and he said that the doctor had told him it was 
caused because he 'ate' too much bread or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors were so alarmed by one patient's condition that they called 
paramedics to take her to a hospital, said David Childress, a county health 
facilities surveyor who led the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a questionable operation," Childress said in an interview. "Whenever 
you have untrained people giving injections, starting IVs, giving treatment . . 
. there's always a potential for danger or injury." 
</P>
<P>
On that day last summer, police arrested Salvador Cano and his wife, Dr. 
Enriqueta Silva, identified in court papers as sole shareholders in the Santa 
Ines Medical Enterprises Inc., which managed Santa Ines and three other 
clinics. Silva is a licensed physician. Authorities allege that Cano used 
Silva's license, prescription pad and even the masculine form of her name -- 
Dr. Enrique Silva -- to write prescriptions and treat patients. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who was convicted in 1986 for the unlicensed practice of medicine at the 
same location, faces trial later this year on three misdemeanor counts of 
practicing medicine without a license and 68 other counts, including Labor Code 
violations. Silva is charged with aiding Cano by lending him her medical 
license. Both deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Silva also has been accused by the Medical Board of signing a death certificate 
for a patient she never saw and of failing to notify the coroner's office of 
the patient's death, according to a complaint obtained by The Times. She faces 
a hearing and could lose her license. 
</P>
<P>
The patient, Maria Pena, a diabetic mother of four, died Jan. 22, 1989, after 
receiving treatment at a clinic in the Santa Ines chain, the complaint states. 
Pena's family has filed a wrongful-death suit naming Silva, Cano and the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Silva is contesting the Medical Board accusation. Her attorney, Joshua Kaplan, 
declined to comment further except to deny the charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers seeking a separate trial for Silva, Kaplan stated that if her 
license had been improperly used, it was "without the consent of Dr. Silva." 
Kaplan added that Silva had no hiring or employee-relations responsibilities in 
the clinics and suggested he would argue that Cano exerted a Svengali-like 
influence over Silva. 
</P>
<P>
Cano's lawyer, Ed Tolmas, labeled the Svengali characterization as "crazy." 
Tolmas said Cano has a medical degree from a university in Mexico but that his 
role at Santa Ines was limited to bill-paying and other administration tasks -- 
not the practice of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Five other people involved in operating the clinics were also charged with Cano 
and Silva. They were James E. Mack, a disbarred attorney identified in court 
papers as secretary of the corporation; Frank Hegyi, a licensed chiropractor 
who is also accused of threatening to turn in an employee to immigration 
authorities if he spoke to investigators; Bruce Miller, an accountant for the 
chain of clinics; and Kelly S. Klatt, a Los Angeles police officer on 
disability leave, and his wife, Samantha, identified as former clinic 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
All claim innocence. Kelly Klatt, tried separately, was convicted last fall of 
unfair labor practices and misrepresentation to the public by claiming the 
clinic was a legitimate medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the charges in the Santa Ines case involve labor practices and tax 
evasion. A separate investigation by the Division of Labor Standards 
Enforcement of the state's Department of Industrial Relations turned up a 
number of alleged violations: employees were required to work up to 11 hours a 
day, six or seven days a week, without receiving overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the clinic administrators, who often paid employees in cash, 
failed to withhold taxes and underreported the size of its payroll. Employees 
were owed back wages exceeding $100,000 but, because they were undocumented 
immigrants, could be counted on by clinic administrators to keep quiet, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cano was "running a sweatshop," said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Gary Wittenberg. 
In addition to the criminal charges filed by the city, the state is suing Santa 
Ines Medical Enterprises, Cano and some of his co-defendants in Superior Court 
in an effort to exact civil penalties and recoup back wages allegedly owed the 
clinics' workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know he (Cano) was not a doctor," a former employee told The Times. 
"Everybody always called him 'Doctor.' He always used the name Dr. Silva, Dr. 
Enrique Silva." 
</P>
<P>
The former employee, who asked that her name not be published, worked for nine 
years in a hospital in her native Ecuador but has no U.S. license. She served 
as a medical assistant in the clinic. In an interview, she described long 
hours, days without lunch breaks, and duties for all the employees that ranged 
from mopping floors to clerical work to giving shots and pregnancy tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We all did a little of everything," she said. "I had experience but many 
(co-workers) did not. One had worked as a secretary in Mexico; here, she worked 
as a nurse with Dr. Silva. Another had never worked anywhere. She didn't know 
what a syringe was. The doctor showed her, more or less, and she was giving 
injections, regardless of what might have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Former employees have told investigators that while an average visit would cost 
$20, many patients ended up having to pay $100 by the time tests and treatments 
had been prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
Tolmas, Cano's lawyer, contended that Cano and Santa Ines were a "clean 
operation" that had been unfairly singled out. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drive up and down 7th Street from two blocks east of Alvarado . . . you 
can turn your head left and right, and every place says 'Clinica, clinica,' and 
(I'm told) there are no doctors in those places," Tolmas said. "Why Cano and 
that facility are being singled out personally bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
Tolmas added that since the first injunction last summer, Cano and his staff 
have followed all of the court's instructions, such as taking down the "Santa 
Ines Medical Clinic" sign. Further, he argued, the clinic had provided an 
important service for the community by offering medical care to the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Superior Court judge's orders, Silva is allowed to continue in private 
practice; her offices are at the former site of the Santa Ines Clinic. And Cano 
has been allowed to continue to work in clinic administration while he awaits 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Wired to a listening device, an undercover medical board investigator using the 
name Ernesto Zapata entered the All Stars Medical Clinic in East Hollywood last 
fall, complaining of stomach pains and a burning sensation in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
The "doctor" who examined him, according to charges filed last month in 
Municipal Court, was Andres Lugo, a man who said he was trained as a physician 
in Mexico but who did not have a license to practice medicine in the United 
States. According to the complaint, Lugo, 35, later told investigators he had 
failed to pass -- three times -- a medical test routinely given to graduates of 
foreign medical schools that would have allowed him to study for a license in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo poked around Zapata's stomach and asked questions about other symptoms, 
about what he had eaten, how much beer and tequila he had consumed and whether 
he had any history of heart or kidney trouble, according to a transcript of the 
secretly recorded conversation filed in court. An assistant took Zapata's blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo diagnosed Zapata as having gastritis and prescribed Mylanta and a drug 
used in treating ulcers, according to the transcript. Investigators said Lugo 
later acknowledged using a prescription pad pre-signed by the licensed doctor 
who runs the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Once Zapata dressed and left, investigators moved into the All Stars Clinic, 
arrested and handcuffed Lugo and took him to jail. He was released on his own 
recognizance and is scheduled to be arraigned this month on three misdemeanor 
counts of unlicensed practice of medicine and falsely advertising himself as a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo told investigators he was hired by Dr. Jairo Gomez, a psychiatrist, to 
help run the clinic, according to court documents. Prosecutors say Lugo was 
also hired last year to fill in for a sick doctor at a clinic in Whittier. He 
had checks printed with the title "Dr." before his name, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo could not be reached for comment. Gomez, who has not been charged, told 
The Times he hired Lugo to work as a "medical assistant" to perform specific 
tasks but not to practice medicine. While declining to discuss details of the 
case, Gomez said Lugo was not authorized to use his prescription pad. 
</P>
<P>
Staffing a clinic for low-income patients can be difficult, Gomez said, because 
there is a shortage of bilingual, well-trained, highly qualified personnel 
willing to work "in a ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone (can be) quite qualified but credential-wise cannot practice," he 
said. "It is kind of a paradox; they are accepted by society to work but are 
deprived of making a living." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, it was the Clinica Medica General that became the alleged victim. 
The Westlake facility put an ad in a newspaper seeking a doctor for occasional, 
part-time work. Within days, Victor A. Matalka responded, presented a photocopy 
of his medical license to a clinic administrator and allegedly began treating 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
But what he failed to mention, according to criminal charges filed last month, 
was that his license had been revoked three years earlier. Matalka, a 
56-year-old Yale graduate, lost his license amid charges he prescribed drugs 
without examinations, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after Matalka started practicing at the Clinica Medica General, a 
doctor who had served on the Medical Board panel that revoked Matalka's license 
visited the clinic as a consultant, the complaint says. He immediately reported 
Matalka to the board, and an investigation ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Matalka faces arraignment this month on five misdemeanor counts of illegal 
practice of medicine and false advertising. A woman answering a telephone 
number registered to Matalka said there would be no comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic, which authorities said was not at fault because it correctly 
required Matalka to show his license, was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
"But for that (the other doctor's visit), he would still be working there," 
said Deputy City Atty. Ellen Pais, who is prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
The boom in unlicensed medicine in immigrant communities underscores the issue 
of access to medical care. As authorities crack down on illegal clinics, they 
-- paradoxically -- reduce the amount of medical care available to thousands of 
low-income immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Some immigrant-rights advocates argue that the care provided by practitioners 
trained in other countries, whether or not they have U.S. licenses, is better 
than no care at all. Many otherwise qualified doctors are barred from working 
here legally because their immigration status is irregular, these advocates 
say. 
</P>
<P>
But regulators disagree. Said Wittenberg of the attorney general's office: 
"When you practice medicine without a license, whether you do it right or 
wrong, it's illegal, and that represents a danger."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet officials said Saturday that negotiators have broken a deadlock 
and moved closer to a historic agreement to slash troop levels and conventional 
weapons in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official announcement of the development as President Bush and 
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded three days of summit meetings with 
an informal session at the Camp David retreat in Maryland. However, a ranking 
Soviet official said in an interview, "The stalemate you Americans talked about 
is over. I don't think any problems remain." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were far more cautious in their assessment. "The deal is not 
done yet," a senior American official cautioned, but he confirmed that the 
impasse was broken. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev, preparing to return to Washington after about 10 hours of 
wide-ranging discussions at the retreat, declared that they had deepened their 
understanding of each other's positions on what the Soviet leader had called 
"the global flash points." 
</P>
<P>
"We have an awful lot of common ground," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the day "very instructive," Gorbachev said, "I think there is really 
ample opportunity for cooperation even though there are real problems that 
neither the President nor I can turn a blind eye to." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned by reporters, Bush sharply defended his decision to proceed with a 
trade agreement with Moscow despite the continuing economic embargo of 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the overall relationship," Bush said, asserting that the trade 
accord is "in the interest of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody wants to argue with me, fine, we'll take him on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev did not comment publicly on the conventional arms issue. In 
Washington, an American official said substantial progress was made toward 
agreements on limiting numbers of tanks, destruction of weapons that are taken 
out of service and the issue of verifying destruction of weapons. Unresolved, 
he said, were limits on aircraft, probably the most complex topic facing the 
conventional arms talks. 
</P>
<P>
The progress toward a treaty to reduce conventional forces -- one of the 
superpowers' chief arms control goals this year -- comes as another positive 
note in U.S.-Soviet relations at a summit that both sides already were hailing 
as a success. 
</P>
<P>
It helped to counterbalance continuing differences over several other major 
issues, including two of the most vexing of the relationship: whether a unified 
Germany will be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Soviet 
handling of the independence movement in the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev again took up Lithuania and Germany during their more than 
eight hours of discussions Saturday at the presidential retreat, an 
Administration official said, but only to go over what they will say at a joint 
press conference at the White House today -- the climax of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have said they expect two more Bush-Gorbachev summits to be 
held later this year, one to sign a treaty reducing conventional forces, 
assuming it is completed this year, and another at Moscow to sign a treaty 
drastically reducing strategic or long-range nuclear weapons (START). The 
conventional forces pact would be signed, probably in Paris, at a meeting of 
the heads of all 35 nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday the two leaders signed a framework for a START treaty and indicated 
that they thought they had narrowed their differences on remaining issues. 
Although some sources suggested the Moscow summit would be officially announced 
today, an Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
such a meeting could not be announced until it is certain that a START treaty 
will be ready for signing this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the sunshine and relaxed setting of Camp David, the two presidents removed 
their ties and sat around a large patio table Saturday as they discussed a wide 
ranging of regional issues, touching on Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba, Nicaragua, 
El Salvador, India and Pakistan, and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
It was "not in a sense of dividing up the world," Bush said. "Maybe that would 
have happened years ago. In terms of ironing the problems, achieving common 
ground, as we looked at a lot of regional problems." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a big day," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush quipped that he had only one disappointment from their time together -- 
that coming at the camp's horseshoe pit. The Soviet president, who never played 
the sport before, "literally, threw a ringer the first time," Bush gasped. 
"There's not much more to say." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier briefing for reporters, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, 
said the President and the Soviet leader included a thorough discussion of 
human rights in their Saturday session. 
</P>
<P>
They discussed ways to increase the number of Jews emigrating from the Soviet 
Union and "talked about direct flights to Israel and the general problems about 
allowing emigration to be as free and open as possible," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that the United States is accepting about 70,000 emigres annually 
now compared to 14,000 a few years ago, Fitzwater said, adding that "we 
continue to want to take more." 
</P>
<P>
During the day, U.S. and Soviet officials also issued a joint statement 
announcing a new cooperative effort to ferry relief supplies to Ethiopian 
famine victims. The statement said U.S. food would be hauled to stricken areas 
on Soviet aircraft "to demonstrate our joint commitment to responding to this 
tragic humanitarian problem." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet negotiators plan to brief their allies on the results of the 
talks on Monday. Unlike the superpower negotiations over reduction of 
long-range nuclear weapons, the Conventional Forces in Europe conference is a 
multinational affair including the 16 members of NATO and the seven members of 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said American and Soviet negotiators reached tentative 
agreements defining classes of tanks and armored vehicles and establishing 
limitations on them. But he said nothing can be considered final until the 
other NATO nations give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of those are likely to be acceptable to the allies, but there are at 
least one or two that will require some careful study and may or may not work," 
the official said. "On some of these issues, ceilings and weights, allied 
equipment is affected more than American equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official said that difficulties may develop between Washington and 
its allies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that problem any more," he added in a somewhat rueful reference 
to the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact -- which has left Moscow virtually 
without allies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev signed a joint statement Friday fixing a goal of completion 
of a conventional arms pact by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has often been overlooked by a world public preoccupied with the 
destructive power of nuclear weapons, the sophistication and destructive power 
of non-nuclear arms in Europe has mushroomed during the years of the Cold War. 
Western leaders see the Vienna talks as an opportunity to roll back Soviet 
power in Europe and end the hair-trigger confrontation that has lasted for more 
than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
"A war in Europe would mean total, irreversible catastrophe," Valentin M. 
Falin, head of the international department of the Soviet Communist Party, said 
Saturday.

MANVILLE TOLD TO RESCUE ASBESTOS FUND

Two judges supervising hundreds of asbestos injury lawsuits on Friday ordered 
the Manville Corp. bankruptcy case reopened to overhaul a financially ailing 
trust fund designed to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint order, a federal judge and a New York state judge said the Manville 
Personal Injury Settlement Trust was out of money and suggested that the 
company advance it $200 million to $300 million so it can resume payments to 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The trust was formed in Manville's 1988 reorganization, six years after it was 
driven into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over production of asbestos, the 
insulation and building material found to cause severe and sometimes fatal 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The trust came under fire last month because of a cash shortage induced by more 
cases, larger payouts and quicker settlements than expected. The trust told the 
judges that claimants filing this year wouldn't get paid until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more than a hundred thousands claimants all over the country and the 
limited assets cry our for a more workable and compassionate system," U.S. 
District Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York State Supreme Court Judge Helen 
E. Freedman said in an order. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, Manville placed $2.5 
billion in assets, mostly stock, into the trust.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summertime is tough for Jeanne Brissette, who longs to give her kids the 
back-yard barbecues and baseball outings she knew while growing up in an 
affluent suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the divorced mother of four is scraping by on $100 a week. Making sure 
her children have new sneakers means months of scrimping. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd have everything my mother had, the nice home and all that," 
Brissette, 42, said recently. "But I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul and still 
barely getting by. How can I hope to get ahead?" 
</P>
<P>
She is part of a suburban secret, 9.5 million poor people scattered among the 
nation's manicured lawns and back-yard basketball hoops. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the invisible poor," said Sheldon Danziger, a University of Michigan 
poverty researcher. "They are seldom discussed." 
</P>
<P>
These people live on the edge of bankruptcy, foreclosure and life on the 
streets. Many have already been pushed off the precipice by New England's 
broken-down economy and inflationary cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
Like Brissette, fellow Wellesley resident Frank G., who spoke on condition that 
his family's name not be used, measures his life in checks: paychecks, 
unemployment checks, checks from relatives lending a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs are scarce, so the 31-year-old construction worker and his wife are 
rearing three children on about $600 a month in a town where the median home 
price is about $340,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm two paychecks away from getting thrown out on the streets," he said. "I 
was treated better in the inner city. At least there you were on the same 
wavelength." 
</P>
<P>
His family and Brissette and her children live in Barton Road, a faded housing 
project for financially strapped families. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's wife has to walk two hours round trip, with children in tow, to a 
supermarket because they have no car and there is no public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of wealthy communities are beginning to face pockets of despair 
camouflaged by country clubs and, in Wellesley's case, a prestigious women's 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, suburban welfare cases have jumped 12%, compared with a 5% increase 
in the number of urban poor. Officials estimate the state has 44,000 suburban 
welfare cases, just 4,000 fewer than in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
More than 28% of the 520,000 people living below the poverty line in 
Massachusetts now reside in suburbia, where about 80 food pantries have sprung 
up to feed them. 
</P>
<P>
"The poverty has been masked for a long time," said Westy Egmont, executive 
director of the Boston Food Bank. "But social-service providers are documenting 
the reality." 
</P>
<P>
Frank found himself homeless after leaving the Navy in 1980. "We've been dirt 
poor, but we're a family . . . and that's what it's all about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's family moved to Wellesley from Boston five years ago when their number 
was called for the low-cost housing project. But the cost hasn't turned out to 
be that low. 
</P>
<P>
Each time Frank gets a decent job, the rent is adjusted upward. It has climbed 
as high as $700. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs have been hard to come by, and welfare is not for Frank, who is built like 
a football player and more than ready to work. He never gives up, but being 
broke gets him down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when friends say: 'Let's go to see the Bruins play' and your 
priority is in diapers," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Living on the edge takes its toll on everyone. But it's perhaps hardest for the 
children, whose schoolmates are dressed in the best and riding brand new 
10-speed bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they say mean things like, 'Your mother's on welfare,' " said 
Frank's 10-year-old daughter, Janelle. 
</P>
<P>

BALLOON-BASED SCIENCE PROBE DAMAGED IN LANDING

A 2 1/2-ton experimental NASA probe crashed and sustained about $2 million in 
damage when a wind gust foiled its landing. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of batteries and electronic devices were strewn on the ground at the 
landing site, said Jack Tueller, a scientist with the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, who helped build the probe. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineer Al Huters said the probe cost between $2 million and $3 million 
to build. He said the device rides on a steel gondola about 10 feet square and 
is carried aloft by a helium-filled balloon. 
</P>
<P>
The probe, used to measure radioactivity in the upper atmosphere, had made two 
successful experimental flights over Australia in 1988, officials said. A wind 
gust apparently caught it as it touched down Friday in eastern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to land very softly," Tueller said. "In the two landings in 
Australia, there was very little damage." 
</P>
<P>
The probe can measure faint emissions from stars and "was putting us on the 
cutting edge of astronomy," Tueller said. 
</P>
<P>
The gamma-ray imaging spectrometer is one of two in the world, Tueller said. 
The other belongs to UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It was launched Thursday from an airport at Ft. Sumner, N. M., and reached an 
altitude of more than five miles.

HUNGARY'S GYPSIES BATTLE OLD BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC CONFLICT: NEITHER COMMUNISM NOR DEMOCRACY HAVE ENDED DISCRIMINATION. A 
FRANTIC BATTLE IS UNDER WAY TO RAISE THEIR DEPRESSED STATUS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hungary's impoverished Gypsies, long shunned by their countrymen, are likely to 
be ignored as the country struggles to reform. 
</P>
<P>
Concern is growing that the Gypsy population -- estimated at 500,000, or one in 
20 Hungarians -- will be toppled or barred from the democratic bandwagon 
sweeping through Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Some predict that the poor, once-migratory grouping will miss out entirely on 
economic, social and political improvements. Hate literature and graffiti in 
Budapest stating "Gypsy-free zone" and "Let's go kill the Gypsies" attest to 
the racial discrimination they have long been subjected to. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is not going to help the Gypsies," predicts Pal Farkas, an 
ebullient, if pessimistic, Hungarian Gypsy politician who recently lost his bid 
for a parliamentary seat on the Hungarian Social Democratic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Easily recognized among ethnic Hungarians because of their distinctive dark 
skin, hair and eyes, Gypsies have been scorned for centuries as shiftless and 
conniving. In 1987 the Hungary's Communist government funded a genetic study of 
Gypsies that purported to prove that Gypsy "criminality" is hereditary. 
</P>
<P>
Today Gypsies are mounting a frantic political assault to improve their 
conditions. But observers say the effort is neither coordinated nor unified. 
Rather, it is torn by factional infighting as fierce as that between Gypsy and 
non-Gypsy. 
</P>
<P>
Every Gypsy leader interviewed for this article denigrated the political 
efforts of all the others. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers say the incoming Democratic Forum government is unlikely to 
take serious steps to help the Gypsies, despite campaign promises. They say 
many Hungarians' hatred of Gypsies, coupled with the depressed economy stemming 
from 45 years of communist mismanagement, provides little incentive to resolve 
the Gypsy problem. 
</P>
<P>
Like Native Americans, Gypsies are an indigenous grouping that has been 
converted into a dependent, deprived society. They are at the bottom of the 
social ladder in terms of income, employment, education, infrastructure, 
medical care and housing, according to Anna Csongor, a Hungarian researcher 
specializing in the education of Gypsies. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideology of the (political) parties seems to be 'a country with so many 
problems can't face the Gypsy problem,' " said Gypsy Jeno Zsigo, who directs 
the Gypsy Social and Cultural Development Center in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Zsigo said 70% to 80% of Hungarian Gypsies live in poor areas. Many urban 
Gypsies are now homeless and suffer frequent physical attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Ten or so Hungarian Gypsy parties sprang up before the March and April 
legislative elections. The groups received a government campaign subsidy of 
about $16,000, but many Hungarians resented this tiny support, calling it a 
waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
In a historic step, two Hungarian Gypsies were elected to the new 386-seat 
Parliament. But another, Agnes Daroczi, who holds a university degree, lost 
even though she cut a deal with the non-Gypsy Alliance of Free Democrats' 
Party. In exchange for a position on the slate, Daroczi agreed to keep her 
Gypsy identity secret and deliver the Gypsy vote. 
</P>
<P>
Daroczi's Phralipe (Brotherhood) Party, a Gypsy political movement, seeks a 
revival and development of traditional Gypsy culture, plus official recognition 
of the Romani language. 
</P>
<P>
Other parties, like the Truth Party of New Hungarians, led by a retired Gypsy 
truck driver, favor assimilation into the mainstream Hungarian culture. 
</P>
<P>
Farkas, the politician, said he urged fellow Gypsies to abstain from voting in 
the elections to demonstrate Gypsies' political impact. Leaders say relief from 
a multitude of social and fiscal burdens will require a concerted political 
effort, though such unity seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gypsy organizations lack an intelligentsia, and the intelligent Gypsies 
are not organized," said Janos Bathory, chief counselor of the Hungarian 
Council of Ministries for National and Ethnic Minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bathory, who campaigned with the winning Hungarian Democratic Forum, decides 
how government aid is distributed to minorities including Jews, Germans, and 
Czeches. 
</P>
<P>
Aid does little to alleviate the Gypsies' problems, which are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the only group in Hungary with any significant amount of illiteracy," 
said Csongor, the researcher. The majority in Hungary work at unskilled jobs or 
are musicians or artists, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During the Nazi Holocaust, an estimated 50,000 Hungarian Gypsies perished. 
Hungarian nationalism and Gypsy poverty have helped trample the survivors or 
their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, where Gypsies are believed to make up nearly 20% of the 23-million 
population, five Gypsy or Rom people were elected to the new legislature. 
</P>
<P>
But Romanians have also branded the late, hated dictator Nicolae Ceausescu as 
having "Gypsy blood." 
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, most of the formerly nomadic Gypsies have been settled for hundreds 
of years. The vast majority live in the nation's poorest villages where 
education is minimal and jobs are unavailable. They are expected by the 
government to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Education is a serious problem. Many Gypsies distrust state schools. They view 
teachers as apathetic at best and intolerant or patronizing toward children at 
worst, Csongor said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Gyorgy Mezei, a social worker, said Gypsy children in Budapest 
have been fainting recently in school due to malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of the Gypsies don't finish compulsory education," said Zsigo, 
also a social worker.

China's hard-line Communist authorities tightened security in the capital 
Saturday and closed Tian An Men Square in an effort to head off any 
commemoration of last year's June 3-4 army attack that crushed a student-led 
democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
One student in Beijing was seen wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the 
pro-democracy movement's V-for-victory symbol. But there were no other signs 
outwardly marking the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are very practical. They're not going to do anything that clearly 
will fail," said a student at Beijing Normal University, which was one of the 
protest centers. 
</P>
<P>
The state-controlled media said the square, the political heart of Beijing and 
the heart of last spring's demonstrations, would remain sealed today and 
Monday. Beijing residents said they had been warned about possible "terrorist" 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the tightened security, activity on Beijing's streets and at several 
universities appeared normal Saturday night. The largest crowd near Tian An Men 
Square was a long line of shoppers outside the Kentucky Fried Chicken 
restaurant south of the square. 
</P>
<P>
The government warned foreign radio stations against broadcasting a taped 
program made by exiled Chinese dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards patrolled Beijing campuses, and armed sentries were posted at a 
major intersection next to the main foreign residential compound in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Tian An Men Square, where last year's protesters had their headquarters, was 
turned into a carnival ground for selected elementary school children as part 
of celebrations for International Children's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of troops and police ringed the vast central square, which was 
otherwise decked in festive regalia, with giant balloons swaying in a torrid 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Paramilitary police stood guard and soldiers exercised noisily while thousands 
of children played games on the vast square. 
</P>
<P>
Today, authorities plan a ceremony in the square to commemorate the 1840 Opium 
War against Britain, which official histories describe as an example of foreign 
imperialist aggression against China. The war was triggered by British trade in 
opium bought in India and sold in China, where it became a major social 
problem.

Italy said Saturday that it is willing to provide a humanitarian haven for 
China's top dissident, Fang Lizhi, holed up in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said no formal request has yet been made by either 
the American or Chinese governments for Italy to take the 54-year-old 
astrophysicist. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the embassy last June, fearing 
retribution for their roles in a democracy movement that was bloodily crushed 
by Chinese tanks.

Ethnic clashes spread Saturday to rural areas of Sind province as 
motorcycle-riding gunmen shot and killed two Pakistani journalists, minutes 
after the pair had completed reports about the violence that has turned Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto's home province into a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the slayings of Ahmed Khan Kamal, a 
correspondent for Pakistan Press International, a small, privately owned news 
agency, and Muthair Naqpit, with Nawa-i-Waqt, a leading Urdu-language daily. 
</P>
<P>
The army, which took control of the southern province Friday as the death toll 
from mounting violence reached nearly 400, said it needs more troops to 
maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
The violence in Sind, which erupted May 15, was sparked by differences between 
the native Sindis and Mohajirs -- descendants of Muslims who migrated from 
India when the subcontinent was divided in 1947. Sindis accuse the 
better-educated Mohajirs of taking the best jobs and most valuable land.

The Irish Republican Army on Saturday claimed responsibility for the shooting 
deaths of two British army men, one in West Germany and the other in England. 
</P>
<P>
Gunmen of the group fighting British rule in Northern Ireland killed an army 
major Saturday outside his home in Dortmund, West Germany, and wounded a police 
officer afterward during a chase. 
</P>
<P>
In the central English town of Lichfield, police hunted for two men who shot 
and killed a soldier and wounded two others waiting for a train late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"While British troops remain in Ireland, such attacks will continue," the IRA 
said in a statement distributed to the news media in Dublin, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, IRA gunmen killed two London-based Australian lawyers in the town 
square in Roermond, Netherlands. The IRA later said it had mistaken the men for 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no argument or reason in this. It is simply that they are out to 
kill," Defense Secretary Tom King said Saturday in an interview with Press 
Association, the domestic news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks in the Netherlands, Germany and England continued an IRA strategy 
of attacking "soft" targets associated with the British army, such as off-duty 
soldiers and recruiting centers. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA, a mainly Roman Catholic group, seeks to unite Ireland under a 
socialist government. It is outlawed both in the predominantly Catholic 
Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland, a British province where 
paramilitary Protestant groups side with London. 
</P>
<P>
Rolf Hannich, a spokesman for the West German federal prosecutor, said Maj. 
Michael John Dillon-Lee was shot several times in the head as he returned to 
his home in a British army housing area in Dortmund just after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Shots were fired from the Mazda at the police cars chasing it, and one 
policeman was hit in the foot," Hannich said. The car was later found 
abandoned.

JAMES FARMER BRINGS DAYS OF FEAR, HATE TO STUDENTS

FREDERICKSBURG, VA. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The distinguished visiting professor with the patch over his right eye tugs at 
a tweed sleeve and bends an ear to his chiming wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-eight minutes past one," James Farmer announces in that resonant, 
mellifluous voice to a hushed class of 40 juniors and seniors, leaning forward, 
pens poised over notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was saying, those troopers were bellowing: 'Come on out, Farmer. We know 
you're in there.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was meant to die that night. They were kicking open doors, beating up blacks 
in the streets, interrogating them with electric cattle prods. I got out alive 
in a hearse." 
</P>
<P>
It was a lovely spring day on the campus of predominantly white Mary Washington 
College, a state institution in historic Fredericksburg, Va. Bright sunshine 
slanting through the budding trees gave a roseate glow to the white-columned 
Georgian brick buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But the imposing black figure at the lecture desk in Monroe Hall was wrapped in 
the darkness of another time, in another Southern state. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't see the azaleas blushing at the windowsill or sniff the cherry 
blossoms that just came into bloom around the fountain in the square. There was 
too much tear gas billowing through the busted windows of the Plymouth Rock 
Baptist Church in Plaquemine, La. And the splashing fountain brought back the 
swoosh of the fire hose washing hymn books and Bibles down the aisle as the mob 
smashed pews and ransacked the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Scared spitless," Farmer says, recalling that violent summer night a quarter 
of a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
One moment he is a terrified Freedom Rider pleading with the local telephone 
operator to put a call through "to the White House, the attorney general, the 
FBI in New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
Then he is a redneck deputy, snarling through jowls chock-full of chaw: "We 
know you're in there, Farmer." 
</P>
<P>
Next he is the spunky female operator of the funeral parlor down the street 
telling him to "play dead in the back of that hearse" and ordering the driver 
to take dirt roads known only to blacks since plantation days. 
</P>
<P>
Then he is himself, the founder of CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, 
wondering if that night in Louisiana, less than a week after the march on 
Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Had a Dream" speech, would be 
his last on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is tremendous," said senior Rich Cooper, one of the students in 
Farmer's course, "The History of the Civil Rights Movement," a full 
three-credit course in the history department. "He's a living piece of history. 
It's hard for students our age to imagine an America where blacks could not go 
into a restaurant, had to ride in the Jim Crow coach next to the engine and 
were hunted down like possums or some other swamp dweller for daring to 
register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a man who has changed history. He's seen it all, and now the tragedy 
is he sees nothing." 
</P>
<P>
But in the classroom the now-blind champion of civil rights sees something he 
never saw before in his 70 years -- a ray of hope, "just a glimmer." 
</P>
<P>
"The hope for America is with these young people," he said, gathering up a 
bundle of their term papers. "Their minds are not closed. At the beginning of 
the semester, black kids and white kids alike find it difficult to grasp that 
this is the way things were here." 
</P>
<P>
With King, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young now dead, Farmer is the last of the 
Big Four of the civil rights movement. "We were the knights of the 
round-table," he chuckled, counting the nine steps down to the taxi taking him 
home for a brief rest before facing an evening class of nearly 200 freshmen and 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer is now in his fifth year at the college named for George Washington's 
mother, where in a student body of 3,500, two-thirds are female and 4% black. 
</P>
<P>
The preacher's kid from Marshall, Tex., who grew up on a series of black 
Baptist campuses where his father, a Ph.D. from Boston University, taught 
theology, is still at it, preaching, teaching with compelling charm a 
nonviolent approach to racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Eloquently he drives home the "fundamental lesson of the civil rights movement: 
Be better than your former self, not better than the South Africans, and 
thereby make a better world." 
</P>
<P>
Students are awed at Farmer's lack of bitterness toward those who have wronged 
him and his race. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Brinser, a Spanish major from Richmond, said: "He's fascinating. It all 
happened to him, and yet there's no bitterness. None. How can he forgive what 
he can't forget?" 
</P>
<P>
In the Eagle's Nest, the student snack bar, some compared Farmer with the actor 
James Earl Jones: the rich voice, the fullback's build, the features borrowed 
from a Roman coin, the deep infectious laughter, the mimic's ability to play 
all parts. 
</P>
<P>
They cited the morning lecture when he was suddenly the owner of a diner on 
U.S. Route 1 between New York and Baltimore, turning away young blacks trying 
to integrate eateries along what they had renamed "Freedom Highway." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't serve Negroes here." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's fine by us," Farmer replies in his own voice. "We don't eat 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"He's very expressive. You think you're right there," said Patty Charron, a 
junior from Springfield, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a lot more than just a performer," insisted Rich Cooper, from 
Pittsburgh. "He speaks from the heart. It's not like a lecture, it's personal 
history. Others graduating with me agree his is one of the five classes you 
should take before leaving here."

In his campus office, surrounded by plaques, awards and 19 honorary degrees, 
Farmer said: "Two-thirds of the graduates have gone through my class. About 500 
a year. A Japanese girl, one of my brightest students, came here just to attend 
my class." 
</P>
<P>
"Once thought of becoming a doctor," he reminisced, his hands laced behind his 
head. "Couldn't stand the sight of blood. That's another of life's jokes, 
considering all the busted heads I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he studied for the ministry at Howard University in the nation's 
capital, where his father taught the New Testament and Greek. But he decided 
against ordination "because the Baptist Church, like others, was still 
segregated. Even today, to this nation's shame, segregation is nowhere as 
complete as at 11 o'clock on a Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
Taking up the civil rights struggle at age 22, Farmer employed the Gandhi 
techniques of nonviolence to organize a sit-in at the Jack Spratt Coffee House 
in Chicago in May, 1942. Thus began CORE. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of soup was dumped over heads and garbage jammed into sandwiches," he 
said, before the movement was strong enough to invade the South with unarmed 
legions of black and white Freedom Riders. 
</P>
<P>
In later years, Farmer was a union organizer, ran for Congress in Brooklyn, 
N.Y., and lost to Shirley Chisholm, went on the lecture circuit and engaged in 
a memorable debate with Malcolm X. He angered his liberal friends by serving as 
assistant secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
His personal life was never easy. There was resentment among both his black and 
white friends against his devoted wife Lula, who was white and his staunchest 
supporter. She died in 1976 after a long, debilitating battle with Hodgkin's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Farmer lost the sight of his right eye to retinal vascular occlusion, 
a rare disease that he thinks was brought on by those hours of exposure to tear 
gas in Louisiana. "But the doctors say there is no evidence in the literature." 
</P>
<P>
He reached the sixth chapter in "Lay Bare The Heart," his poignant 
autobiography, when the left eye began to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to resort to a powerful magnifying glass to go on writing in longhand on 
yellow legal pads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he began teaching, he could make out vague, shadowy shapes in the first 
few rows of lecture chairs. "Now I don't see the students at all. I just hear 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
Then, with booming laughter, as if the joke had just occurred to him, he 
pronounces himself "literally color blind. Used to be I could tell black kids 
from white kids by their voices. But as blacks move into the middle class and 
attend Eastern colleges, they begin talking like whites. You can't tell anymore 
by their enunciation and pronunciation. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think black English will disappear. Blacks who speak downtown 
English still speak the ghetto language when they go back to visit the family 
or attend church." 
</P>
<P>
One reason Farmer's classes are the most popular on campus is the gallery of 
national figures he summons up from personal experience: 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedys: "When the Freedom Riders reached Montgomery and rioters held us 
virtual prisoners in the First Baptist Church, Bobby Kennedy telephoned Martin 
Luther King to get me to halt the march and have a cooling-off period. My 
response was: 'We have been cooling off for 350 years. If we cool off anymore, 
we will be in a deep freeze.' The attorney general was furious, and that fury 
was shared promptly with his brother, the President. So I was never on good 
terms with the Kennedys." 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson: "At first I was welcome in the Oval Office: 'From Marshall! 
Doggone, Jim, that's Lady Bird's hometown. Her daddy had a filling station 
there.' That bond of Texas engulfed us. But I soon fell from grace when I 
refused to go along with a moratorium on demonstrations during the campaign 
against Goldwater." 
</P>
<P>
Adam Clayton Powell: "A clever man. He had more charisma than Jesse Jackson, 
but he didn't like the NAACP, which we joked meant, 'Never Annoy Adam Clayton 
Powell."' 
</P>
<P>
Louis Farrakhan: "Racism of any color is bad. I hate the things he stands for, 
but I'd fight for his right to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
On the day civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy died, April 17, Farmer told the 
class about encouraging Abernathy to write his controversial autobiography, 
"And The Walls Came Tumbling Down." But "I warned him: 'Don't tell all.' 
</P>
<P>
"He just grinned, but now I wonder if his death wasn't hastened by the inner 
turmoil he must have gone through wondering if he had done an injustice to his 
dear friend, dearer than a brother, Martin Luther King. I just wish he hadn't 
written those three pages about Martin's sexual escapades on his last night 
alive. It wasn't needed. There was nothing new. It had all been written 
before." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Black History Month, Farmer is a guest speaker at dozens of 
colleges. Whenever an opportunity arises, he encourages black athletes to get 
their diplomas before turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy," Farmer sighed. "They are quick to ask: 'Hey, professor, where 
did it ever get you? Show us your new BMW." 
</P>
<P>
But the professor says he learns a lot from his students, especially from their 
term papers. "I give them a choice of a research paper or writing some personal 
experience with race relations. More than half chose a personal experience. 
They tell of having a black friend in childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases, as they approached puberty, entered middle school, they were 
yanked apart by parents or neighbors who ostracized them and called them 
nigger-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
"It came as a revelation to me that so many white kids had black playmates and 
had that traumatic experience. It came up in paper after paper read to me. 
Their poignant childhood memories show that race has colored -- no pun intended 
-- every aspect of this country's life. None of us, black or white, is 
untouched by it."

SUPREME COURT'S MARSHALL PLANS TO OUTLIVE THE OPPOSITION 
</P>

<P>
Thurgood Marshall's place in history was assured before he became a member of 
the Supreme Court in 1967. Now his conservative critics are saying it is time 
for the first black justice to step aside for a younger, more energetic 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, a civil rights pioneer who, as a lawyer, helped change the nation, 
will be 82 in July. He deflects questions about his retirement with 
curmudgeonly humor. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lifetime appointment, and I intend to serve it," he has said many 
times. He once told The Washington Post: "I expect to die at 110, shot by a 
jealous husband." 
</P>
<P>
For decades before President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to the high court, 
Marshall was known nationwide as a legal champion of the poor and the 
powerless. Some say his contribution to the civil rights effort was equal to 
that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In 23 years as legal director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People and later as the federal government's solicitor general, 
Marshall argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court. He won 29 of them. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest victory for the NAACP came in the 1954, when the court ruled 
racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"He changed America," said Erwin Griswold, a former Harvard University Law 
School dean who also served as solicitor general. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of great American lawyers, I think of Thurgood Marshall, Abe 
Lincoln and Daniel Webster," said Georgetown University Law School Dean Thomas 
G. Krattenmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Legal scholars agree that Marshall's accomplishments before he came to the high 
court far surpass those of any fellow justice. It is his stature on the court 
that has been questioned of late by conservatives. They say he is losing 
interest in much of the court's day-to-day work and delegates too much 
responsibility to his law clerks. 
</P>
<P>
Former clerks deny it. Marshall declined to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
One of the harshest attacks on Marshall came from Terry Eastland, who was an 
aide to former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III. Eastland last year wrote in the 
National Review: "One joke has it that if Marshall retired, at least he 
wouldn't be paid for watching television." 
</P>
<P>
That reference apparently was prompted by earlier reports that Marshall watches 
"The People's Court" on a TV set in his court office. Marshall has denied the 
reports, saying, "That's an awful program." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Marshall's supposed work habits are often voiced along with doubts 
about his physical condition. Standing 6 feet 2 and overweight, Marshall shuns 
exercise. He had a heart attack in 1976, and has suffered from pneumonia and 
bronchitis. He was hospitalized in 1987 for a potentially dangerous blood clot 
in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall walks slowly, apparently with difficulty. His family reportedly 
persuaded him to give up driving a few years ago; he gets to work in a 
chauffeur-driven car. 
</P>
<P>
His former clerks, however, insist that his health is not deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown law professor Mark Tushnet, a Marshall clerk in 1972, said: "He did 
not look in good health then. He doesn't look any different now." 
</P>
<P>
Tushnet, who is writing a biography of Marshall, also dismissed the idea that 
the increasing dominance of conservatives on the court has soured Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed grumpy when I worked with him and he seems grumpy now," Tushnet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Legal scholars say that the succession of conservative appointments to the 
court has denied the old civil rights fighter the chance to shape the law that 
was briefly his. Within two years of Marshall's arrival on a predominantly 
liberal court, Warren Burger replaced Earl Warren as chief justice, and the 
retreat had begun. 
</P>
<P>
"But Marshall has been very important in providing visions of where the law 
should go," Krattenmaker said. "He has written several (dissenting) opinions 
that may prove to be persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall and Justice William J. Brennan are the court's most consistent 
liberals and most frequent dissenters. They stand alone in opposition to all 
capital punishment, press for broader protection of defendants' rights and 
support affirmative action for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's former law clerks say he is the court's conscience, that his role is 
to make sure that the other justices realize that their decisions affect real, 
flesh-and-blood people. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall suffers from glaucoma. At times he seems to have trouble reading 
summaries of his opinions from the bench. At his 80th birthday celebration he 
insisted that television camera lights be turned off because the glare hurt his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, during oral arguments before the court, Marshall posed several 
questions to a lawyer he seemed to believe was representing the government 
when, in fact, the lawyer was representing the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"If I appear confused, I am," Marshall said at one point. When another justice 
identified the counsel, Marshall recovered by telling the lawyer: "Well . . . 
there is no bar to you giving me some help." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's public appearances away from the bench are rare. When he does 
appear, he doesn't mince words. 
</P>
<P>
In televised interviews in 1987, he said that President Ronald Reagan's civil 
rights record "ranks at the bottom," and accused Meese's Justice Department of 
trying "to undermine the Supreme Court itself." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a conference of lawyers and judges that year, he said he was not 
about to quit fighting the right-wingers. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry. I'm going to outlive those bastards," he said.

EXPERTS VIEW THE SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will the U.S.-Soviet agreement on chemical weapons really make a difference in 
a world where other nations have made and stockpiled them? 
</P>
<P>
 It will make a difference, because it puts us irrevocably on the path toward a 
global ban on chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be viewed by other nations -- including unstable regions 
like the Middle East -- as a clear indication of the superpowers' willingness 
to forsake these weapons forever. 
</P>
<P>
More practically, the agreement will allow us to test key provisions of the 
global ban before it is concluded. We should not sit back and allow too much 
time to pass before bringing a chemical disarmament treaty into existence. We 
may not be able to roll back the entire chemical proliferation problem. But 
this bilateral agreement is an important first step. 
</P>
<P>
Elisa D. Harris 
</P>
<P>
Senior Research Analyst, Brookings Institution 
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-Soviet agreement will probably not make much of a difference. There are 
no very satisfactory verification methods. The agreement will be largely a 
matter of moral restraint. In the present context, the political incentives 
against a violation are very strong in the Soviet Union. In the years ahead 
that context could change. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing about chemical weapons is that ever since the end of 
World War I, whenever the two sides in a conflict both have them, they have not 
been used. When only one side has them and the other side does not (as in the 
Iran-Iraq war) they have been used. That should give us pause about completely 
opting out of chemical weapons production.

BUSH AIDES FEAR MAJOR FIGHT ON ARMS TREATY; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: SENATE WRANGLING OVER RATIFICATION COULD HURT FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
MOSCOW. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even as President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev initialed the 
broad outlines of a strategic arms reduction treaty on Friday, Bush 
Administration officials were growing uneasy about the prospects for a major 
wrangle in the Senate over the ratification of the final START agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, conservatives have begun to muster their forces for a fight 
against what they see as U.S. concessions in earlier negotiations between 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. A clutch of vocal Republicans have warned that they may oppose 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns the Administration is not that START might fail in the Senate but 
that a noisy fight could damage Administration efforts to negotiate further 
arms cuts with Moscow -- including conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 20 senators -- many fewer than the 34 no votes needed to block a 
treaty -- would be likely to vote against START, according to the 
Administration's early nose counts. But officials acknowledged that acrimony 
over the treaty will be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a bloody battle," said one Pentagon official, who added that 
the conservatives' defection has stung the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that trouble in the Senate could cast a cloud over other 
negotiations was underscored by developments Saturday on conventional forces in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Following Friday's talks between Bush and Gorbachev, ebullient Soviet aides 
declared a breakthrough on the previously stalemated effort to negotiate 
European troop cuts. U.S. officials, while less bullish, were careful not to 
throw cold water on the Soviets' assessment of the summit sessions. 
</P>
<P>
In the even more delicate minuets that lie ahead, the last thing Administration 
negotiators want is congressional critics denouncing their handiwork. "It 
always weakens the President's hand if he does not have the support of the 
legislative branch" on key national security issues, noted Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Potential opponents of the START accord have focused their ire on provisions 
agreed to by Baker and Shevardnadze. Saying he had "split the difference" with 
his Soviet counterpart on a number of outstanding details of the START 
agreement, Baker agreed to accept numerical limits on nuclear-tipped cruise 
missiles with ranges over 375 miles -- a number the Soviets proposed -- and 
appeared to consent to the exclusion of the Soviet Backfire bomber from 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative arms experts also are troubled by Baker's failure to persuade 
Moscow to accept limits on further testing of the Soviet SS-18 missiles. The 
two sides have agreed to ban "new types of heavy ICBMs," but conservatives fear 
Moscow could get around that prohibition by "modernizing" the existing SS-18s. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, conservatives feel, Baker appeared to accede to the Soviets' 
reluctance to complete reductions in their conventional forces in Europe before 
a final START treaty is signed later this year. That puts the United States in 
the position of rewarding the Soviets with a favorable nuclear arms control 
agreement while it continues its military occupation of Eastern Europe, 
conservatives charge. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this could change; the Administration seems to expect an agreement 
this year on conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The vaunted negotiator caved in to basic Gorbachev demands all the way down 
the line," wrote conservative columnist William Safire in the New York Times. 
Baker's "get-a-deal imprudence" allowed him to be taken "to the cleaners," 
Safire said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials sought to assuage disgruntled Senate 
conservatives this week with promises that Baker's actions would not bind 
negotiators as they complete work on the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being assured that when we see the text of what they're initialing, 
we'll see that they haven't given away the store," said one Republican staff 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is widespread suspicion among conservatives that the final 
agreement will include several of the most troubling provisions. 
</P>
<P>
That could pave the way for a querulous Senate debate. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this a lack of enthusiasm for the treaty on the part of many Senate 
liberals and moderates. Congressional sources said last week that the START 
agreement's failure to put limits on mobile missiles or naval weapons, in 
addition to what they see as its modest warhead reductions, have disappointed 
many senators whose firm support for the treaty could be key to quick 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
If such lawmakers believe that the benefits of the treaty are marginal, one 
Democratic aide noted, they are more likely to demand clarifications and may 
even send negotiators back to the table, as they did several times during the 
ratification process of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces agreement. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when Bush may need the Senate's goodwill for future arms treaties, 
that kind of protracted debate could pit the President against a Senate that is 
fiercely protective of its "advise and consent" prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Democrats such as Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, are expected to submit conditions for ratification that 
will seek to ensure Pentagon compliance with the ABM treaty in the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile program. The Soviets intend to issue a separate unilateral 
statement outside of the START treaty to the effect that any significant 
violation of ABM will be grounds for pulling out of START, and legislators like 
Nunn want to underline their intention to make sure the ABM treaty is observed 
in a relatively narrow way. 
</P>
<P>
With these and other forces forming, some analysts have already noted eerie 
parallels between the forthcoming START ratification debate and the acrimonious 
clash over ratification of SALT II, which was finally set aside when the 
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in December, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, several veteran negotiators involved in drafting the START accord 
have either criticized the agreement or quit in protest over the 
Administration's haste in completing the treaty. Edward L. Rowny, Paul H. Nitze 
and Richard N. Perle, all powerful conservative voices in sinking SALT II, have 
raised new criticisms of START and the haste with which it has been negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some have warned that a harsh Soviet response to the Baltic states' 
demand for freedom could doom the START treaty as surely as Moscow's invasion 
of Afghanistan did the SALT II accord. 
</P>
<P>
Even Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), while predicting "smooth sailing" for the 
treaty, warned that "if Lithuania got out of hand, (it) would be a different 
matter . . . like Afghanistan finally scuttled the Salt II treaty. If a Tian An 
Men Square-type operation occurred in the Soviet Union or with Lithuania," 
Cranston added, "it could poison the atmosphere and maybe kill the treaty." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Paul Houston contributed to this article. 
</P>
<P>
THE SUPERPOWER ARSENALS 
</P>
<P>
Although the START treaty is not complete, most major decisions have been made. 
The pact will limit each side to a total of 6,000 warheads. No more than 4,900 
warheads can be on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and no more than 3,300 can be on 
ICBMs alone. 
</P>
<P>
Listed below are major weapons systems and how they will be affected by START. 
Total destructive power is listed for missile systems and submarines, many of 
which carry multiple warheads.

2 ARTISTS TO OFFER GORBACHEV VISIONS OF PEACE;

Two Bay Area artists who will present their works to Mikhail S. Gorbachev at 
Stanford University on Monday have wanted to meet the Soviet president for 
years, but neither dreamed they would get the opportunity only a few miles from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted personally to shake Gorbachev's hand. . . . I figured I would have to 
go to Moscow in order to do it," said Sausalito painter George Sumner, whose 
oil work "The Peacemakers" will be given to the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an honor and a privilege to give him this," said Cathy Schuman of 
Hillsborough, whose abstract painting "Creation of Peace" -- an enamel on wood 
with swirls of black, orange and blue -- will also be presented to Gorbachev. 
Schuman said she had dreamed of visiting the Soviet Union one day to try to 
give her painting to Gorbachev. "I never thought it would turn out like this." 
</P>
<P>
The two artists are scheduled to present their works to Gorbachev during a 
short ceremony Monday after he tours the Stanford University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Both artists are well-known in the Bay Area -- not only for their art but also 
for their political activism. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Sumner's paintings have been turned into posters promoting 
environmental groups and causes, including "The Peacemakers," which was the 
official Earth Day poster in San Francisco this year. Schuman, who is active in 
Democratic politics, has painted some prominent Democratic figures, including 
presidential candidates Jesse Jackson, Walter F. Mondale and Gary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Sumner said "The Peacemakers," which has two dolphins kissing above the planet 
Earth, was inspired by Gorbachev's 1987 visit to the United States, which the 
artist says marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War. In a string of 
letters over the past several years, the 49-year-old Sumner had been lobbying 
Soviet officials for a chance to personally present his painting to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"During our generation, I think he has more impact than any other single 
person," Sumner said. "I don't want it to sound too gooey, but I felt he won 
the hearts of Americans. I just want to thank him. . . . That's exactly why I 
painted it -- I wanted to enhance my chances of meeting him." 
</P>
<P>
Sumner, who uses recycled baby diapers instead of brushes, mainly paints whales 
set against backgrounds of bright bluish swirling mists. He has also recently 
begun to incorporate dolphins into his work. 
</P>
<P>
Sumner's painting of the Golden Gate Bridge became the official poster of the 
bridge's 50th anniversary celebration in 1987. And "Sweet Liberty," his 
painting of the Statue of Liberty, was chosen for permanent display at the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
Schuman, 48, is mainly known for her portraits of well-known Bay Area corporate 
and political leaders. Her paintings of the three Democratic presidential 
candidates were displayed at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A Stanford alumna, Schuman worked for many years designing women's clothing. 
But she had always wanted to be an artist, and in the early 1970s she began 
painting well-known Bay Area figures, such as clothier Cyril Magnin and Ben 
Swig, owner of the Fairmont Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Although successful, she said she eventually tired of portraits. In 1986, 
Schuman began experimenting on more abstract projects, developing a technique 
that is anything but traditional. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of using brushes, Schuman drops globs of enamel paint on a wooden 
panel, then moves the panel around until the paint settles. She sets the panel 
in the sun for several hours to change the texture, then adds more paint and 
color and repeats the process until the work has the "right texture." 
</P>
<P>
"My art is very tactile. It's mandatory to touch it. It needs to be touched," 
she said, leading a tour of her studio. 
</P>
<P>
After spending several years experimenting with the new technique, Schuman 
finally created "a breakthrough" painting in 1989. Inspired by political 
changes in Eastern Europe, she dedicated her painting to Gorbachev and 
christened it "Creation of Peace." 
</P>
<P>
"He is dealing with breakthroughs on a global scale, while this painting 
represents a personal breakthrough for me," Schuman said.

BAY AREA TAKING TIGHT SECURITY IN STRIDE AS RESIDENTS PREPARE FOR GORBACHEV'S 
VISIT;

SAN FRANCISCO: U.S. AUTHORITIES ARE STRIVING TO GIVE THE SOVIET LEADER THE BEST 
POSSIBLE PROTECTION.

<P>
On the high-society block where Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his 
wife, Raisa, will sleep tonight, the neighbors and their help know all about 
the demands of security. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford University, where Gorbachev will speak Monday, students are taking 
the metal detectors and other precautions in stride, so anxious are they to get 
a glimpse of the Soviet leader and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
With Gorbachev's 8:45 p.m. arrival drawing near, hammer-and- sickle flags flap 
in the San Francisco Bay breeze. Vendors peddle T-shirts. And U.S. law 
enforcement authorities are polishing up their plans to encase the Soviet 
leader in the tightest security possible. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 days, U.S. Secret Service agents have been walking the routes 
the Gorbachevs will travel and have told residents in the Pacific Heights 
neighborhood where the couple will be staying to keep away from their windows 
and off their roofs, lest they be mistaken for snipers. 
</P>
<P>
During the next two days, the Secret Service will be responsible for ensuring 
the safety of 10 "protectees," all of them past or present leaders of nations 
and high government officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gorbachev, the Secret Service must protect former President 
Ronald Reagan, for instance, who will have breakfast with the Soviet leader at 
the consul general's home, and South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, who is 
scheduled to meet Gorbachev on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Logistically, it is a little bit more work," Richard McDrew, special agent in 
charge of the Secret Service in San Francisco, said of Roh's visit, announced 
last week. Then he amended the comment. The visit by the South Korean leader 
means "a lot more work." 
</P>
<P>
McDrew is a veteran of visits by presidents, Pope John Paul II in 1987 and 
Queen Elizabeth II in 1983. "I don't want to say it is routine, but it is 
standard," he said, noting that he simply requested extra armored limousines 
and agents from other offices to help with such functions as communications and 
bomb sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service is the U.S. agency responsible for protecting foreign 
leaders. On this occasion, the Secret Service will share the task with agents 
of the Soviet KGB and South Korean security agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody identifies themselves as KGB," said Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice 
president for public affairs. "They just say they're Soviet security. They 
strike me as typical policemen who are interested in things they should be 
interested in." 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service and KGB will be assisted by agencies ranging from the FBI to 
the California Highway Patrol as well as by police in San Francisco, Palo Alto 
and Stanford, and security officers at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Law 
enforcement officials would not say how much the policing would cost or how 
many would be involved. 
</P>
<P>
No one involved in the security planning seemed especially worried as they 
explained how traffic will be slowed whenever Gorbachev's 30-car motorcade 
travels down normally clogged freeways, or how demonstrators will be kept at 
bay, or how hundreds of people will be herded through metal detectors before 
hearing the Soviet leader speak. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of celebrities and ex-presidents before," said Jim McCarthy, 
head of security at the Fairmont Hotel, where Gorbachev will speak on Monday 
and meet privately with Roh. 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachevs will stay at Soviet Consul General Valentin Kamenev's home, a 
Pacific Heights mansion monitored by a video camera and ringed by a 
wrought-iron fence on what may be San Francisco's toniest block -- the 2800 
block of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors away lives a member of the family that owns Levi Strauss. A Getty 
lives a few doors down in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric workers checked for leaking gas lines in front of 
the home late last week. Pacific Bell worker Paul Bowman, asked Saturday what 
he was doing with phone lines outside the consul general's home, replied, "It's 
secret." 
</P>
<P>
The street will be barricaded during the visit. Residents will have to park on 
nearby streets and walk home. Guards will check residents' identification 
before letting them pass. 
</P>
<P>
Security precautions are nothing new on the block. Hilda Gotcher, secretary to 
Dodie Rosekrans, a next-door neighbor of Kamenev, noted that not long ago, the 
family hosted a fund-raiser attended by former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
Any inconvenience will be of little bother to Rosekrans. She is co-chairwoman 
of Friends of Raisa Gorbachev, and one of four people from the group scheduled 
to meet with Mrs. Gorbachev at the Kamenev residence Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast with the Reagans, the Gorbachevs will head to Stanford, 35 
miles south. The trip will give the Soviets a chance to visit the Silicon 
Valley, an area few of their fellow citizens have seen, at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
The university does no classified work. But the U.S. government has declared 
much of the Silicon Valley off-limits to Soviets because of the many defense 
contractors and companies there that develop technology coveted by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Counterintelligence experts assume that during state visits most spying ceases. 
Soviet agents will be busy protecting their leader and probably won't have time 
to gather intelligence, noted David W. Szady, head of the FBI's unit 
responsible for combatting Soviet spying in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they wouldn't want something to happen that would be an 
embarrassment," Szady said. ". . . Embarrassments -- that's what everybody 
protects against." 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, officials issued tickets Friday to several thousand students and 
staff members to see Gorbachev arrive in the quadrangle Monday morning. The 
quad will be closed in the hours before the arrival. The business school, where 
Gorbachev will meet with selected students and faculty, also will be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,700 people who will attend Gorbachev's speech at Stanford's Memorial 
Auditorium will have to pass through metal detectors. No briefcases or cameras 
will be allowed. Hoover Tower will be closed during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers will ensure that the 30-car motorcade travels Bay Area freeways 
swiftly between San Francisco, Stanford and San Francisco airport. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators are planning to mass outside the Fairmont when the Soviet leader 
speaks at the Nob Hill hotel. But San Francisco police doubt that he will draw 
anywhere near the thousands who protested against the Pope in 1987. 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNISTS IN EAST GERMANY STAGE PROTEST

Tens of thousands of Communist supporters rallied in the East German capital 
Saturday to protest the government's decision to take control of the ousted 
party's vast holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters rallied in a park to denounce what they called the "fascist" 
action of the democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"First, PDS banned. Second, books burned. Third, Auschwitz?" read a banner at 
the rally, seeking to compare the government to Hitler's Nazi regime. 
</P>
<P>
PDS stands for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the reconstituted Communist 
Party that lost power last year. 
</P>
<P>
The government news agency ADN estimated the crowd at about 65,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters were angry about the decision by Parliament on Thursday to put 
the vast holdings of the defunct Communist Party in trust pending an 
investigation by an independent commission of their value and ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The former Communists amassed millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in houses, 
businesses and property during their four decades in power. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Gregor Gysi, leader of the former Communist faction that holds 66 
seats in the 400-member Parliament, has accused the government of seeking to 
eliminate his party by seizing its assets.

INDONESIA ORANGUTANS USE RULES OF THE JUNGLE TO TEST SAVIORS' SKILLS 
</P>

BOHORK, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urinating on its pursuers from the tree tops, a Sumatran orangutan shows no 
sign of wanting to leave its home, a scrap of jungle in the middle of a cocoa 
plantation. 
</P>
<P>
The plantation is inexorably expanding, however, and what is left of the furry 
red animal's habitat will soon be providing beans for the chocolate lovers of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
The hapless clutch of people wielding chain saw and nets under the tree were 
part of a project sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature to save the 
threatened apes by moving them to forests safe from cocoa farmers, developers, 
loggers and animal traders. 
</P>
<P>
The orangutan rules the jungles of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it has no 
natural enemies except r man. 
</P>
<P>
A baby stays with its mother for years, clinging with little hands onto her 
long chest fur as she swings from tree to tree. It is helpless without her, and 
she protects it fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia it is illegal either to keep baby apes as pets or to trade in the 
animal internationally. 
</P>
<P>
A live baby fetches $190 locally, four times that in Jakarta, and up to $5,000 
in New York, according to a local forestry official. 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to capture a baby orangutan. Shoot the mother and you have the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Trapping an adult is a different story, however. 
</P>
<P>
Drive it up a tree, cut off its escape route by felling the surrounding trees, 
and then chop down the tree it sits in. The orangutan will scuttle down the 
swaying trunk straight into the waiting nets. Easy. 
</P>
<P>
Or so the textbook says. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the way orangutans operate in the wild," said Michael Griffiths, the 
nature fund's representative in Sumatra's main city, Medan. 
</P>
<P>
"They sit up there staking out the scene from their vantage point and then come 
down and make off through an opening no one on the ground even thought of." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, annoyed by net handlers yelling instructions and dogs yapping at 
the base of the tree, one orangutan slid down the trunk and lumbered off into 
the bushes, dogs following. 
</P>
<P>
It paused long enough to turn and give the dogs a withering look, then sped up 
another tree. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually two orangutans were caught and taken off the plantation. 
</P>
<P>
"The plantation called us in instead of just going out and shooting the animals 
or leaving them to die as they cleared the land. That's a real step forward," 
Griffiths said. 
</P>
<P>
The apes were released in Gunung Leuser National Park, near the nature fund's 
north Sumatra Orangutan Rehabilitation Station. 
</P>
<P>
The station also gets young orangutans when they have been seized by the 
authorities from captivity or when they outgrow their welcome as pets and are 
turned in. 
</P>
<P>
"As pets, they don't know anything (about survival). We have to teach them to 
climb, to hunt for food," a field worker named Ketut said. 
</P>
<P>
After a short time in quarantine to rid them of ailments unknown in the jungle, 
and basic training in the art of swinging on vines, they are taken to the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
There, on a platform up a tree, fieldworkers feed them a daily diet of milk and 
bananas. 
</P>
<P>
"Bananas, bananas, bananas. A very boring diet, and we (intentionally) never 
give them quite enough," Ketut said. "That way they get bored and hungry and go 
off hunting on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Forays for more interesting food take the animals farther and farther afield. 
Some stop coming back to the feeding place of their own accord, some need a 
little encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"We lug them off into the forest, sometimes five days' walk away, where they 
can have their own territory," Ketut said. 
</P>
<P>
With its 3,100 square miles of land, Gunung Leuser park gives the apes plenty 
of protected territory to choose from. The nature fund estimates there are 
about 2,000 orangutans in Sumatra, and another 5,000 in Indonesian and 
Malaysian Borneo. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to protect the beasts has gone international. Six orangutans 
intercepted in Bangkok on their way to Yugoslavia were returned to Jakarta in 
late May. 
</P>
<P>
"We're serious about this," forestry official Ajisasmito said. "If we find any 
more Indonesian orangutans abroad, we will extradite them too."

<TEXT>
<P>
A Mohawk Indian who views casino gambling as an economic boon to the 
reservation unseated the tribe's anti-gambling incumbent chief in an election 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The election amounted to a referendum on gambling, an issue so divisive among 
Mohawks it led to bloodshed May 1, when two Indians were shot to death in a 
clash between pro- and anti-gambling factions. Since then, New York state and 
Canadian police have occupied the 28,000-acre reservation, which straddles the 
international border. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Tarbell received 637 votes to defeat his distant cousin, incumbent 
Harold Tarbell, who got 538 votes in his attempt to win a second three-year 
term, according to acting tribal secretary Stacey Terrance. Twelve votes were 
ruled invalid, she said. Harold Tarbell said he would appeal, alleging voting 
improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
With Norman Tarbell's election, the three-man tribal council ruling the U.S. 
side of the St. Regis Indian Reservation will unanimously support casinos on 
Mohawk land. The other council chiefs are Lincoln White and L. David Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Tarbell is to become junior chief on the council on July 1. At that 
time, Jacobs becomes head chief and White second chief. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Tarbell said Saturday that his first priority as a chief would be "to 
put our people back to work." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists such as Harold Tarbell claim that the eight casinos on the U.S. 
side of the reservation breed drug-running, prostitution and other crime. 
White, Jacobs and Norman Tarbell say the casinos bring badly needed jobs to the 
reservation, where the unemployment rate is about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,400 Mohawks were eligible to vote in the election on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Tarbell said Saturday night he would contest the election on the grounds 
that Jacobs and White excluded U.S. Mohawks living on the Canadian side from 
voting. In past elections, Mohawks living there were allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I haven't quite lost yet, because there were so many improprieties . . . 
we're going to have to sort that out in the next couple of months," Harold 
Tarbell said. He characterized the voting as "chaos," and said: "It made no 
sense to protest . . . so we're going to have to appeal it." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and White adopted a list of eligible voters based on tribal rules that 
allow only Indians living on the U.S. side to vote. A state Supreme Court judge 
upheld the list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Tarbell, who lives on the U.S. side, said he wasn't on the official 
voting list but was allowed to vote anyway. He alleged that the many people not 
on the list were also allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the U.S. Indians living on the Canadian side are gambling opponents and 
likely would have voted for Harold Tarbell. As many as 500 U.S. Indians living 
in Canada would have been eligible to vote, Harold Tarbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The casinos have been closed while tribal leaders negotiate with state and 
federal mediators to end the gambling war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
A dispute over casino gambling had simmered for years on the St. Regis Indian 
Reservation before two Mohawks were killed in separate shootings on May 1. 
Since then, there has been a heavy police presence at the reservation, which 
straddles the border between the United States and Canada. Gambling proponents 
say the casinos provide badly needed jobs in an area of high unemployment, but 
opponents argue that they breed prostitution, drug-running and other crimes.

CRUISE SHIP CLEARED FOR TRAVEL AFTER TWO FIRES IN ONE WEEK

A luxury liner that caught fire twice and ran aground once in a week received 
conditional clearance Saturday to return to sea even though an arsonist might 
be lurking on board, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they suspect a crew member aboard the hard-luck cruise ship 
may have set the second fire, which broke out Friday, five days after an 
apparently accidental blaze caused the ship to run aground in Delaware Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unnerving," Lt. Pete Hoffman said. "We're concerned about the firebug, 
and we want him to be found and removed. But the bottom line is, when we're 
satisfied the ship is safe to sail, we'll let it sail." 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Gary Rives said an inspection Saturday turned up several "minor" 
violations, such as faulty hatches and fire doors. But if the problems are 
corrected by today, the Regent Star could depart on a scheduled five-day cruise 
to Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the fire in a lower-deck storeroom Friday was deliberately 
set while the 24,000-ton ship was docked at Penn's Landing. No one was injured, 
but the fire forced the cancellation of a weekend cruise. 
</P>
<P>
The arson is being investigated by Philadelphia police and the federal Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, but no suspects were in custody. 
</P>
<P>
An apparently unrelated fire as the ship was steaming toward Philadelphia five 
days earlier knocked out the ship's power and forced it to run aground in the 
Delaware Bay off Fortescue, N. J. The ship was refloated Tuesday after nearly 
900 passengers were evacuated. Officials said they do not think the fire was 
set deliberately.

WITH FEMALE PRESIDENT, HAITI'S WOMEN SAVOR FIRST REAL TASTE OF POWER;

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women till the poor land, toil in sweatshops and perform the other drudgery 
that moves Haiti's meager economy, but the choice of a woman as president in 
March was their first real taste of power. 
</P>
<P>
"They dominate in agriculture, trade and industry," sociologist Daniele Bazin 
said. "They, in fact, run this country." 
</P>
<P>
Until Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, 46, was installed March 26, women were virtually 
excluded from power in Haiti, which has been ruled by dictators through much of 
its 186 years. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as the early 1980s, women were regarded as "legal minors," barred 
from opening bank accounts, buying property or traveling without the consent of 
their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
Those laws have been repealed, but little has been done to improve the hard lot 
of most Haitian women. 
</P>
<P>
Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court, has become 
a symbol of women's aspirations since taking office as provisional president. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept in the name of Haitian women," she said at the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Her civilian administration, which is to govern as caretaker until democratic 
elections can be held, replaced the 18-month-old military government of Lt. 
Gen. Prosper Avril, who was driven into exile by a popular uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Pascal-Trouillot by a coalition of opposition groups "had 
psychological impact," historian Suzy Castor said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the army gives up power to a civilian, and to a woman at that, it has a 
lot of meaning," she said. "I don't have illusions, but it represents a few 
steps." 
</P>
<P>
Symbol she may be, but the elegant, highly educated president has little in 
common with her illiterate, impoverished sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Women from privileged families have gained ground in Haiti -- about half the 
doctors are women, for instance -- but only one-fourth of university students 
are women. What money is available for higher education usually goes to a son. 
</P>
<P>
Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, is 
the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its 6 million people live in the countryside, working tiny mountain 
plots of coffee, sugar cane, rice and corn with primitive tools. Agriculture 
accounts for 32% of a gross national product valued at $1.5 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Half the work force is unemployed, and average annual pay for those who find 
jobs is only about $370. Most city dwellers live in slums without electricity, 
potable water or adequate sewers, and life expectancy is 53 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,300-member army is a way out of poverty for men. Women run the 
households, care for the children and support the economy in countless ways. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the distribution and sale of crops is carried out by peasant women who 
walk long distances in the mountains to sell their goods at outdoor markets. 
</P>
<P>
Women called "Madames Sara," for a migratory bird, handle most of the trade 
with the rest of the Caribbean, traveling to the Dominican Republic, Puerto 
Rico, Martinique, Curacao, and Panama to buy kitchenware, shoes and food for 
sale at home. 
</P>
<P>
Government tax incentives and low wages attract foreign-owned manufacturing 
plants that produce electronics, clothing and sporting goods for sale abroad, 
mostly in the United States. Women make up about 75% of the factory workers, 
who are paid only $3.20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist at the University of Puerto Rico, said 
women's economic contribution is "overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
"Though we don't have the data, I believe women produce the better part of 
Haiti's GNP," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of Haitian mothers rear their children alone. Marriage is commonly 
viewed as a preserve of the upper class and most children are born out of 
wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
Couples who live together consider themselves married, but men have no legal 
obligation to pay child support or alimony. Men change wives at will and may 
have several at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"Men run around a lot to prove their virility," said Irene, a 22-year-old 
housemaid who asked that only her first name be used. 
</P>
<P>
Claudette Werleigh, social affairs minister and the Cabinet's only woman, said 
men often have several "wives" in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the poor, the man has many women, so he is absent," she said. "He 
escapes the problems, the sick children, the crying." 
</P>
<P>
Haiti has an infant mortality rate of 135 per 1,000 births, highest among 
Western nations, and women tend to have several children so a few will survive. 
Children are a woman's protection when the man leaves, and often go to work 
when very young. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing a woman has to look forward to in Haiti is that her children 
will have a better life than she does," said Bazin, the sociologist. "They are 
her insurance policy, and she will slave so her child can get an education." 
</P>
<P>
Violence against women is common, but usually goes unreported because abused 
women have nowhere to turn. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no women's shelters," said Lilian Pierre-Paul, a popular radio 
newscaster. "When they are beaten they come here. They come on foot, in trucks, 
to talk to me and ask for help." 
</P>
<P>
Feminists say attempts to organize have been difficult because Haitian women's 
priority is economic survival. "Women don't have time to go to meetings," said 
Michele de Ronceray, a sociologist and political activist. 
</P>
<P>
Women's groups have sprung up in recent years, however, and some observers see 
Pascal-Trouillot's government as a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"We go the countryside and women are saying they are concerned about their 
lives," said Daniele Fouchard, founder of am education and health center for 
illiterate women and children that has 300 branches. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, they weren't able to say what they were thinking; they were afraid 
to talk," she said. "People are thinking something can change with a new 
person, with a woman as president."

COLLIS LAUNCHES ATTACK AD AGAINST 2 CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conway Collis, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for insurance 
commissioner, Saturday began airing a new attack commercial alleging that two 
leading opponents, state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) and television 
commentator Bill Press, are the candidates of the insurance industry and the 
state's trial lawyers, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Both Garamendi's and Press' campaigns cried foul. Another Democratic candidate, 
Walter Zelman, described the new ad as "fiction," referring to its statement 
that Collis had been involved "every step of the way" in the fight for 
Proposition 103, the insurance reform initiative that passed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said: "Let me restate the facts. I've not taken a single dime from 
any insurance company in this campaign. I will make every insurance company 
obey Proposition 103. I will create the most effective insurance consumer 
protection agency in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Press' campaign manager, Michael Ganley, called the new Collis ad "a deliberate 
distortion by a desperate, failed politician." 
</P>
<P>
Ganley took a swipe at Collis' record on the state Board of Equalization, 
saying: "Once again, Collis is running away from his sorry past of accepting 
campaign contributions from big corporations and then voting them big tax 
breaks. In fact, Collis, the professional politician, accepted over $20,000 (in 
his board campaigns) from the very insurance companies whose backs he now 
promises to break." 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said records he has gathered indicate the insurers gave Collis only 
$6,850 in his past campaigns. But in taking exception to Collis' new ad, Zelman 
suggested that it contains so many misstatements that television stations 
should refuse to run it. 
</P>
<P>
The new Collis commercial features Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 
103 who has endorsed Collis for insurance commissioner. It also shows pictures 
of both Press and Garamendi, calling Press the trial lawyers "guy" and 
Garamendi the insurance industry's "guy." 
</P>
<P>
It also alleges that $90 million was spent by the insurers and the trial 
lawyers to defeat Proposition 103. Contribution and spending reports filed with 
the state in 1988, however, showed the lawyers spent nothing to defeat 
Proposition 103, and that of $64 million spent in the insurance initiative 
campaigns that year by insurers, a considerable amount went to advance their 
own three initiatives, not to attack Proposition 103.

THEY MAKE ADULT TOYS FOR PLAYING IN THE SAND 
</P>

Craig Hanloh grinned as he strapped himself tightly into the squat, 
knobby-wheeled Suzuki quad runner. He revved the engine, zipped down a back 
street and flipped the craft in a perfect somersault. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a motorized rocking horse, too," he said as he climbed out of the 
contraption. "We took it up and down Myrtle (Avenue). People thought we were 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
But these toys, stage props designed for the zany comedian Gallagher, are mere 
side projects for Hanloh's Sandrail Manufacturing Co. 
</P>
<P>
His specialty is custom-built "sandrails" -- dune buggies without fiberglass 
covering their tubular frames of stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
"Expensive toys for adults," Hanloh calls them. 
</P>
<P>
Hanloh says his business on Railroad Avenue grosses $450,000 a year, turning 
out about 180 sandrail frames and 20 complete vehicles annually. Ten people 
staff the 7,700-square-foot workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Another San Gabriel Valley firm, Fun Runner in Rosemead, also makes custom 
sandrails, but sells mainly frames and parts. "We generally don't do the whole 
thing," said co-owner Linda Tebo. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ham, executive director of the 5,000-member California Off-Road Vehicle 
Assn., said there are 10 to 20 sandrail manufacturers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
A current assignment at Hanloh's workshop is a $40,000 all-aluminum sandrail 
for George Schultz, a customer from Thousand Oaks. The car, which will whip 
over the dunes at 102 m.p.h., boasts a gleaming DeLorean motor made of aluminum 
and steel, instead of the cast iron used in most engines. 
</P>
<P>
"Aluminum is lighter, and if it's lighter it's faster," Schultz, the Carson 
city engineer, said gleefully. "It goes from zero to 100 m.p.h. in 3.30 
seconds!" 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle, which Schultz has dubbed the Dune DeLorean, has a transmission 
worth $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (the price) goes for appearance," said Hanloh, adding that patrons 
frequently bring in their own designs for the firm to construct. Sandrails are 
priced from $6,000 up, depending on customers' selection of fancy touches -- 
from chromed shift boxes to fiberglass seats with velour covers. 
</P>
<P>
Hanloh, 30, who purchased the business with his wife, Leigh Anne, in 1985, says 
most of his customers are from Southern California. But a visiting sheik from 
the United Arab Emirates once ordered 21 cars for his desert playground, Hanloh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The young sheik flew the Hanlohs to Abu Dhabi to teach him to operate the 
buggy, Hanloh said, proudly producing photographs of Arabs crowding around his 
creation. He added that he is working on establishing a partnership with the 
sheik to market the product in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In California, sand dragging enthusiasts may legally operate the vehicles in 
remote areas designated by state and federal authorities. Two popular sites are 
the sands of Glamis, 233 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and Dumont Sand Dunes, 
130 miles west of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Sandrails are not considered "street legal" under the California Vehicle Code. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, no," California Highway Patrol Officer Trany Morton said. "They're going 
to have to have windshields, wipers, a series of things." 
</P>
<P>
And Monrovia Police Capt. Dennis Jacks was less than amused when told about 
Hanloh's recent stunt on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you heard of reckless driving?" he said. "If it was not licensed, it was 
illegal to even be on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Hanloh said he does not usually operate his creations on city streets. On sand, 
however, they are safe and fun for licensed drivers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ham, of the Off-Road Vehicle Assn., said he has not heard of many accidents 
involving sandrails. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Koski, an area manager of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which 
oversees a number of sand dragging sites, including Glamis, said the sandrail 
"is the most stable of vehicles that they drive out in the dunes." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Koski said, his office plans to accept a donation of a "rescue buggy" 
sandrail from Hanloh to help pick up casualties of accidents on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
He said sandrail mishaps are "few and far between." 
</P>
<P>
But they do happen. 
</P>
<P>
George Fedderke, 44, a foundry superintendent from Hacienda Heights, recently 
returned to Sandrail with an order for a second car after he wrecked his first 
in a race at 85 m.p.h. on the dunes of Glamis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to be competitive as far as the looks and the speed," said Fedderke, 
whose first sandrail cost him more than $20,000. "You have a vision in your 
mind and he (Hanloh) puts it into tubing. I go in with a lot of crazy ideas."

ELECTIONS MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THREE YEARS, VOTERS SET TO DECIDE; 
</P>
<P>
CITYHOOD: EVEN OPPONENTS PREDICT THAT AFTER TUESDAY, THE COUNTY WILL HAVE A NEW 
CITY. 
</P>

<P>
After three years of effort by cityhood backers and months of stalling by Los 
Angeles County officials, Malibu voters Tuesday will finally get the chance to 
decide whether the seaside community becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
And although approval is widely expected, with even opponents predicting that 
resentment at the county's long attempts to delay the election will help push 
cityhood over the top, there is still plenty of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to deciding whether Malibu becomes a city, voters will also pick a 
five-member City Council from among 30 candidates. They include several 
slow-growth advocates who fought long and hard for cityhood, at least two 
candidates who oppose cityhood and several others who, while opposing it in the 
past, say they now favor cityhood and want to have a say in Malibu's future. 
</P>
<P>
The election, some say, amounts to a referendum on whether the community long 
famous for its celebrities and surf remains a semi-rural enclave or, as some 
fear, becomes a resort on the order of Miami Beach. The outcome is of critical 
importance to developers who own land in the area, and to environmentalists who 
want to preserve the slender stretch of Malibu coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers, many of whom have long viewed incorporation as their best 
chance to stop the county from installing a regional sewer system in Malibu, 
have predicted that it will pass by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our phone research in the last couple of months indicates that it has 
about 80% support," said Audrey Beatty, co-chairwoman of MCI/YES on Y, a 
pro-cityhood group that was formerly the Malibu Committee for Incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a silent majority that has trepidation about cityhood, and if they 
come out and vote, I think there will be some surprises," cityhood opponent Bob 
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-square-mile city would stretch from Topanga Canyon to Leo 
Carrillo State Beach and nearly one mile inland. It would have a population of 
about 25,000, and about 8,500 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 candidates, most observers expect about a dozen to attract 
substantial support. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few candidates that only their friends and relatives will vote 
for," said one political consultant, who asked not to be identified. "There 
probably aren't more than 12 to 15 (candidates) that you can consider serious." 
</P>
<P>
Among those most often mentioned as favorites are Walt Keller, former 
co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation; Larry Wan, former head 
of the Malibu Township Council, and John Merrick, a retired Municipal Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Malibu Times endorsed all three men, along with Mike Caggiano, 
long associated with the Malibu Township Council, and land-use attorney Paul 
Shoop, who has far outspent other candidates while declining to accept campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop and Merrick are among several candidates who have opposed cityhood in the 
past and who have had to fend off accusations from opponents who contend that 
they have ties to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, who may have the most to lose should voters approve cityhood and an 
anti-sewer, slow-growth majority is elected to the City Council, have been 
noticeably absent from the debate over incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Until two weeks ago there was no organized opposition to cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Concerned Citizens for Protecting Malibu's Future has advertised 
heavily in local newspapers and distributed material at candidate forums and 
other campaign events. 
</P>
<P>
The group contends that Malibu's projected $5-million budget is not adequate 
and that a new city of Malibu could face financial ruin from liability as a 
result of landslides. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters accuse the group of being a front for developers and have 
complained that, as of last week, the organization had not disclosed the source 
of its finances as state law requires. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a few of Malibu's large landowners appear to have concluded that 
passage of cityhood is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu Bay Co., which owns property in the Civic Center area and elsewhere, 
helped sponsor a candidate fair, and Hughes Aircraft, which has a large 
research facility in Malibu, took out ads in a local newspaper commending 
cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
For cityhood backers, however, a bigger surprise was when Sylvia R. A. Neville, 
managing general partner of the Adamson Cos., told a Malibu newspaper that she 
supports cityhood, even though her company earlier sided with the county in a 
bid to delay Malibu's efforts to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
The company's plans to build a $65-million, 300-room luxury hotel in Malibu, 
and Pepperdine University's plans to double the size of its campus, depend on 
the sewer system's being built. 
</P>
<P>
Several council candidates have said that, if elected, they will immediately 
push to have the city try to block the county from starting work on the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the Local Agency Formation Commission's approval of Malibu's 
cityhood bid last year, the county will have jurisdiction of any sewer system 
for up to 10 years after incorporation. But lawyers for cityhood supporters 
have said they do not believe that the provision is valid. 
</P>
<P>
After being ordered by a judge in April to set the election, the county Board 
of Supervisors sought to delay the actual incorporation date until next March, 
if cityhood is approved, in a bid to start work on the sewer before a new city 
government has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
However, another judge sided with cityhood backers and ruled that the 
supervisors had no authority to impose the delay. 
</P>
<P>
Even last week, lawyers for the county tried unsuccessfully to persuade 
Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski to prevent a City Council from taking 
office, should cityhood be approved, until an appeals court considers the 
county's argument. 
</P>
<P>
Unless an appellate court intervenes, if cityhood is approved, Malibu would 
become a city after the election results have been certified, probably in late 
June or early July.

ACCUSATIONS AGAINST GLENDORA'S MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We believe a crime has been committed in Glendora but it was not our mayor, Bob 
Kuhn, who committed it. 
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, the crime that was committed was the false accusations against 
Bob Kuhn by one citizen in Glendora (Times, May 17). Because of the false 
accusations of this one citizen, Bob's name and reputation, which he has built 
over the last 25 years, was tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who know Bob know that he would never do anything to jeopardize his 
reputation or his name. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that the person who was responsible for this fiasco realizes how 
foolish they look. No wonder they want to remain anonymous.

GAMBLING INITIATIVE DRIVE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backers of a referendum to create a legalized gambling club in West Hollywood 
have begun collecting signatures for a petition that would require the City 
Council to put a gambling initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The council last December unanimously rejected a request for a referendum that 
would have allowed gambling on all legal card games at Cavendish West 
Hollywood, a private bridge and rummy club at 9255 W. Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the November ballot, the group needs the support of 15% of the 
city's 20,000 registered voters -- roughly 3,000 signatures -- on a petition by 
June 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we will be able to get the signatures we need to qualify the 
measure," said Bruce Decker, a spokesman for the West Hollywood Club Initiative 
Committee. "We have contracted with a professional signature-gathering firm and 
we plan to do a signature-gathering blitz over the weekend and through 
(Tuesday's) election." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents claim that the club could generate from $5 million to $10 million 
annually for the city, roughly 10% of the club's estimated gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
To make the issue more appealing to the voters, Decker said, the initiative 
requires the city to earmark three-fourths of its revenues for the elderly, 
increased law enforcement, gay and lesbian services, and the revitalization of 
the city's east end, where the club is to be located. The city would be allowed 
to use the remaining one-fourth at its own discretion.

EDUCATION: SOME FROWNED ON THE WEST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE PRESIDENT'S MARKETING 
TECHNIQUES. BUT ITS ONCE-LAGGING ENROLLMENT IS GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Linda Thor has a dream. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to create a parking problem on this campus," says Thor, president 
of West Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
She isn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Half-empty parking lots are the mark of a college that needs more students, and 
the unorthodox administrator is doing everything she can to attract and keep 
students, including using marketing techniques more often associated with the 
sale of soap than colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Thor, 40, was named acting president of the Westside campus in March, 1986, 
with a mandate from the board of trustees of the Los Angeles Community College 
District to stop the school's enrollment erosion. The student body had shrunk 
from 11,600 in 1980 to just 6,400 in 1986. The trustees made their wishes 
clear. Boost enrollment 20% by September, 1986, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of talking to community leaders and high school principals in the 
area, Thor discovered that West, as it is called on campus, was thought to have 
an image problem. She also found that nobody knew quite what the school's image 
was. Formerly in public relations (a fact that made her a controversial choice 
for the job), Thor felt the school needed to find out just how it was perceived 
before it could hope to increase its appeal. With a grant of $17,000 from the 
district office, the college hired a San Francisco consulting firm to conduct 
an "image study." 
</P>
<P>
That first study revealed that 77% of area residents and others surveyed knew 
little or nothing about the school. That was not a complete surprise. Unlike 
highly visible Santa Monica College, its chief rival for students, West is the 
college that's hard to find, hidden away on 70 pastoral acres in the hills 
above Culver City. Nor is there much there, edifice-wise, once you arrive. The 
school, which never completed its original building program, has no auditorium, 
student union or gymnasium, although two major buildings are in the design 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that the school was thought to be "boring" and not the 
kind of place a serious student would want to go. West, which has major 
programs in aircraft maintenance and travel and tourism, has far fewer academic 
courses than Santa Monica and sees far fewer students -- only 5% -- transfer to 
four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the campus was thought to be unsafe. In fact, Thor points out, it has 
the best security record of the nine colleges in the district. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with faculty, students and staff, the administrator decided to 
put a major portion of the school's advertising and recruitment budget into 
letting the community know the college existed. A booklet describing campus 
services and course offerings was bulk-mailed to 225,000 residents of the 
widely divergent Westside communities the school draws students from, including 
Beverly Hills and Baldwin Hills. On the cover was a color photograph of the 
campus at its most comely. Inside, information about how safe the campus is was 
prominently displayed, as were photos of smiling staff and alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Thor recalls that there was some initial grumbling by a few of the faculty 
about the appropriateness of a college's using the strategies of the 
marketplace. Fortunately for her, the mailing (along with other programs and 
activities based on the study) did the assigned job. By the trustees' deadline 
of September, enrollment was up 34% over the previous fall. This year 
enrollment is 9,200. 
</P>
<P>
Thor, who was named permanent president in 1987 (at 37 she was the youngest 
community college president in the state), continues to have faith in surveys 
and other marketing techniques as an aid to recruitment. Since that first image 
study, close analysis of enrollment information and other data has also helped 
the college fine-tune its programs and services, Thor says. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very much a campus for working adults," Thor said, explaining that 80% 
of the students are enrolled part time, and more attend at night than during 
the day. The college has instituted a program called PACE (Project for Adult 
College Education) that allows working students to earn 12 units of college 
credit a semester by taking courses one night a week, watching instructional TV 
for two hours a week and attending six Saturday programs. 
</P>
<P>
The students' orientation toward evening classes prompted the school to add 
early evening classes (held from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.) to the existing pattern 
of classes from 7 to 10 p.m. Now students can take two courses an evening. 
</P>
<P>
Thor says the skew toward evening also caused the administration to re-think 
its food service. In the past, the college had a traditional cafeteria that 
only served food from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. "It was losing $30,000 a year," she 
said. Convinced that another configuration was needed, the college tore out the 
cafeteria and replaced it with vending machines that are accessible whenever 
students are on campus. The vending machines are making $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at who was coming in the door told us what kind of college we are and 
where our priorities should be," Thor said. 
</P>
<P>
The college has also responded to the fact that it has the highest female to 
male ratio in the district (62% of the students are women) by instituting 
evening day care four nights a week. Children can be left until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring the college hired a consulting firm to study the demographics of 
the student body even more closely. That analysis produced profiles of two 
statistically typical West students. "Profile A," as the report calls her, is a 
black woman in her 20s who goes to school during the day and perhaps at night 
as well, with the intention of transferring to a college that gives a 
baccalaureate. "Profile B" is a white woman in her 30s who may already have a 
baccalaureate degree. She attends at night, either for job training or to 
prepare to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Banking on the likelihood that other people fitting these descriptions might 
like the school, the college now tries to speak directly to both types of women 
in advertising and promotional materials. It makes a pitch to Profile A in 
spots on black radio stations and tries to reach Profile B in spots on KSURF. 
It also tries to anticipate and alleviate concerns these students are likely to 
have. Because safety is a concern for virtually all women, the school has also 
begun hiring students from its officer-training program to serve as uniformed 
security "cadets" on campus, supplementing the regular guards. 
</P>
<P>
The mailing describing class offerings now includes short autobiographical 
essays by typical graduates, such as Jeanne Breunig (a Profile B who graduated 
in 1984), who speaks to returnees' fears when she writes: "It was scary at 
first, but the instructors made me feel so comfortable. . . . They recognized 
the hardships of women with families who were returning to school and, by their 
attitude, they seemed to be saying, 'I know what you're going through and 
you're doing a wonderful job!"' Breunig is, of course, smiling in the 
accompanying photograph. 
</P>
<P>
The study also pinpointed the neighborhoods (by ZIP code) that produce most of 
the students that fit each profile -- many of the Profile A students come from 
Baldwin Hills, while West Los Angeles and Culver City send most of the Profile 
B students. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm that did the study identified neighborhoods with similar 
demographics as areas of high recruitment potential and suggested that the 
college target them for mailings that emphasize the likely interests and 
concerns of both types of students. Exposition Park has been identified as a 
rich hunting ground for Profile A students, neighborhoods in West Los Angeles, 
West Hollywood, Pacific Palisades and elsewhere as a good place to seek Profile 
B students. 
</P>
<P>
The college no longer does mass mailings. Now that it knows who it is looking 
for, targeted mailings are more economical, Thor says. 
</P>
<P>
Problems -- or "challenges," as the public-relations-conscious administration 
likes to call them -- remain. For reasons that are not really understood, the 
college attracts the highest percentage of black students (48%) in the 
district. White students who live in the area prefer Santa Monica College. West 
wants to keep its black students, but find out more about why so many white 
students go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Monica has a marvelous reputation," Thor said. "I try not to be paranoid 
about Santa Monica College, but to help this institution finds its niche." 
</P>
<P>
The college is also trying to get a better handle on why its 
semester-to-semester retention rate is poor. "Red flagging" students at high 
risk of dropping out and then offering them special help has been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
West is still the college where there's always room to park, but Thor is 
hopeful that it will change. On the first day of school last fall, she recalls, 
there was a genuine traffic jam on campus. "I almost got out of my car and 
cheered."

Angeles College is the community college nobody knows. Unlike high-profile 
Santa Monica College, the school has more than enough parking, much to the 
chagrin of President Linda Thor, who's doing everything she can to bring in 
more students.

Fred Maas, 32, is a developer and vice president of Potomac Investment 
Associates, a Maryland-based company seeking the land exchange to enable it to 
build an access road to a proposed 750-home and golf-course development on 
Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. Maas, who specializes in community and 
government relations for the company, moved in 1988 from the Washington area to 
Westlake Village, where he lives with his wife, Elizabeth, and their 
7-month-old daughter, Katherine Claire. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why should the federal government approve the land exchange with your 
development company? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are benefits at several levels. First, with the new proposal that 
involves Mr. Hope's properties in the Santa Monica and the Santa Susana 
mountains, 80% of his property -- 5,700 acres -- would be in public ownership 
and open space in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when development pressures are enormous in Southern California 
because of the number of people who are moving here and the scarcity of land, 
it is truly incredible that we are able in one fell swoop to put that vast 
quantity of land in public open space. We think it is a hard offer to turn 
down. Anytime you are able to get 5,700 acres for 59, I think responsible 
government officials should be willing to take a look at it, as they are here. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the road, as we've designed it, has much less impact on the neighboring 
communities than roads that could be built through other access points to our 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why would the road you have proposed be less disruptive than other roads you 
could build if the land exchange is not approved? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't want to be in a position of saying, "if this, then that," because 
that might seem like a threatening posture. But anyone who has ever been to 
Jordan Ranch can see that there are a number of other access points. Old 
Agoura, the community just west of the proposed road, has a very rural feel, 
and any road that would require going through it obviously would change the 
character of that community. 
</P>
<P>
We have an access up through China Flat we could use, and obviously that would 
have a devastating effect on the most sensitive area of our property. Certainly 
that option was not preferable for us or for the conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Could Jordan Ranch be developed if the land swap is not approved and you are 
not allowed to build the access road? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. The general plan for our property would yield about 14 160-acre 
ranches or ranchettes, or about 28 80-acre ranches. That would require 
dissecting the most sensitive areas of the property. There are those moderate 
people in the environmental community who believe that the effect of 28 or 14 
large ranches, which entirely bisect Jordan Ranch with no dedication of open 
space, has much less public benefit than a plan which is well-thought-out and 
well-planned and which makes available 47% to 50% of its area for public open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with the large ranch design is that the ranches will 
typically be fenced. That brings that particular large parcel of 2,500-acres or 
so out of any potential corridor for the movement of wildlife through the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Ranches would also create long-term development pressures. What happens in the 
year 2010 when homeowner 13 of the 14 homeowners tries to subdivide his 
property? Real estate environments change over 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If your Jordan Ranch development proposal is approved, what efforts will be 
made to preserve oak trees, wildlife and other natural resources that now are 
abundant on the property? 
</P>
<P>
A. In terms of sensitivity to the environment, I think our vision is to have a 
project that will be a model for all development here in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
We've done a massive redesign of the golf course so that we would not impact 
the Palo Comado Creek and the wetlands in the area. The creek will be moved 
only in two places, and in both of those cases, it is to save oak trees. 
Wildlife in and around the golf course will be minimally impacted. We are doing 
a massive oak tree restoration replanting effort. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the public ownership of China Flat would be a key to all of this. China 
Flat has been on the National Park Service acquisition list for 20 years. We've 
come up with a proposal that will preserve that forever. So I think again, what 
we are proposing is really responsible and would hope to serve as a model for 
environmentally sensitive development in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Yet development at Jordan Ranch would result in the destruction of animal 
and plant habitat, would it not? 
</P>
<P>
A. Those things will be fully explored in the environmental impact studies 
being done for the National Park Service and for Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties. We believe that virtually any impact created by our project will 
either be designed around or mitigated against. 
</P>
<P>
We are working right now with a team of wildlife experts to come up with a plan 
that facilitates animal movement in and around and through our property. One of 
the key things in terms of wildlife movement is China Flat, a sort of hub for a 
series of open space wheels, made up of public parks and private open space in 
the surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Given the fierce competition between the national park and developers for 
scarce mountain land, why shouldn't the parks agencies seek to block any 
development at Jordan Ranch? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A. I don't want to step on the turf of the people in the Park Service and 
Conservancy, but it's getting tough. We are talking an era where money just 
isn't available. It is very difficult this day and age to find substantial 
holdings within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area boundaries 
that park budgets can afford and that are owned by people willing to sell. 
</P>
<P>
So I think negotiating is not the only way but certainly an important way. 
Where there are developers who are willing to work with responsible park 
agencies, I think it's prudent for them to be working with them. It's better to 
have half than nothing, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates wants to swap 1,100 acres of the Jordan Ranch in 
eastern Ventura County for 59 acres of National Park Service land in Cheeseboro 
Canyon. Potomac would use the canyon property for an access road to the ranch, 
where the developer wants to build a golf course and 750 homes. That deal -- 
the linchpin of a larger land swap that would put a total of 5,700 acres in the 
Santa Susana and Santa Monica Mountains now owned by comedian Bob Hope into 
public ownership -- needs federal approval. Some environmentalists are 
staunchly opposed to the land swap.

THE NEW HOLLYWOOD HOT PROPERTY; 
</P>
<P>
THE COMPETITION FOR MOVIE RIGHTS IS SO FIERCE THAT MANUSCRIPTS ARE BOUGHT BY 
PRODUCERS EVEN BEFORE THEY CROSS THE PUBLISHER'S DESK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SEAN MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
One Thursday morning in January of this year, the manuscript of a new novel by 
Warren Adler, "Private Lies," was sent out by messenger from the Triad Artists 
agency in Century City to 15 Hollywood studios and producers so that the movie 
companies could bid for the rights to turn the novel into a film. The 
manuscript had not yet been delivered (or even sold) to a publisher, but that 
mattered not a whit in Hollywood, where a bounty was already being offered by 
eager producers for purloined copies. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in "Private Lies," a story about marital infidelity and betrayal 
involving two couples, set in Africa and promising four starring roles, was 
perhaps particularly keen because Adler was also the author of the book "War of 
the Roses," which was made into a movie at 20th Century Fox in 1989 that 
grossed $84 million in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 24 hours later, Tri-Star Pictures outbid Warner Bros., 
Columbia and Carolco and purchased the film rights to "Private Lies" for $1.2 
million. It was one of the highest amounts yet paid in Hollywood for an 
unpublished manuscript (the book will be published next February), but it was 
only the latest bonanza for a novelist in the frantic futures market of the 
film business where the first drafts of what are thought to be hot books are 
circulated among producers and auctioned for movie sales before they even see 
the ink of galley proofs. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Webb, who runs the literary department at the William Morris Agency in 
Beverly Hills, recalls having to sell Dominick Dunne's book "People Like Us" 
before the author had even finished it because a production company, with an 
early draft in hand, called to make an offer. "I had to call New York right 
away and say, 'Get me the manuscript,' " says Webb. 
</P>
<P>
Webb sold the rights to Dunne's new book, "An Inconvenient Woman," to ABC 
Productions for $500,000. "People were begging to bid on it," she says. "That's 
the way people are when it comes to books. When producers get wind that a 
network wants to do a book, they've got to have it, they'll do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director David Lynch's new movie, "Wild at Heart," which just won the 
top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, was adapted from a novel by Barry 
Gifford that has not yet been published. Michael Crichton's new novel, 
"Jurassic Park," to be published in October, was purchased by Universal for 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, producer Richard Zanuck paid $1 million cash for the rights to 
"Rush," an autobiographical first novel by Kim Wozencraft (published by Random 
House in April) about a Texas narcotics cop gone bad and back again. "I don't 
grill our people on their methods," says Zanuck, who, like many producers, 
keeps two full-time scouts on his payroll in New York, "but we, like others, do 
get a very early look at material." 
</P>
<P>
This race to acquire new books is part of the current competition in Hollywood 
that has broken records for spending levels and brought writers -- 
screenwriters, as well as novelists -- closer to the big money long enjoyed by 
stars and directors. The latest sales figures signal a rebound from the 
comparative literary doldrums of the early 1980s, when even the rights to 
bestsellers commanded $250,000 and less. Although no writers are approaching 
the earning power of Tom Cruise or Sylvester Stallone, "Writers are finally 
coming into their own," says Todd Harris, the 30-year-old agent who conducted 
the "Private Lies" sale and has sold roughly 150 books to the movies in the 
last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood has looked to books for stories at least since the arrival of sound 
in the mid-1920s, as is evident from any list of its most memorable films, from 
"Gone With the Wind" to "The Graduate," from "The Maltese Falcon" to "Born on 
the Fourth of July." Yet, its willingness to pay large sums for these literary 
sources has waxed and waned, fluctuating with the film industry's jittery 
pulse, interest rates and slavish pursuit of the next big thing. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the film or publishing businesses can say for sure why Hollywood has 
plunged into a new bull market for books, but speculation rests on such factors 
as the renewed search for adult stories fitted to the aging moviegoing 
audience, the inflation of costs (and profits) throughout filmmaking, the 
number of high-profile books bought by trend-setting producers Peter Guber and 
Jon Peters while still at Warner Bros. ("The Color Purple," "Witches of 
Eastwick," "Bonfire of the Vanities") and what some in the industry see as a 
glut of formulaic "original" screenplays, that is, scripts not based on other 
literary or dramatic material but often written in imitation of other movies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the studios are now in the hands of "the new old players," 
as one agent puts it, executives who, like Guber and Peters, have switched from 
one company to another and are willing to splurge to get their first movies 
made at their new addresses. 
</P>
<P>
That "there are so many powerful producers now is the main reason," says Esther 
Newberg, co-director of the huge ICM agency's literary department in New York, 
which recently made sales of close to $1 million for the rights to Robert 
Daley's not-yet-published "A Faint, Cold Fear," a romantic thriller about a cop 
and a reporter, and an untitled novel by Zev Chafets about organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be stepped up and books are included," says William 
Morris' Webb, who sold the rights to Susan Isaacs' 1988 novel "Shining 
Through," about a female American Jewish spy during World War II, to 20th 
Century Fox for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If something has a buzz on it, they buy it and then worry about what to do 
with it," says Huntington Beach writer Kem Nunn, whose highly regarded 1984 
surfing novel "Tapping the Source" was purchased by producer Martin Bregman and 
Universal Pictures for a six-figure sum but has never been made. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Clain, who targets books for movie sales in New York for Triad, says, "In 
the past, the attitude (in publishing) toward people in the movie business was 
a little leery, because movie people are known for a lot of talk and no action. 
But now agents are more willing to talk film rights because Hollywood seems to 
be spending so much money. It's a very good time to be selling film rights to 
books." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a pattern to the kind of books Hollywood is buying, that too is 
hard to detect. Crime and punishment ("Rush," "Presumed Innocent") are big, but 
so is social satire ("Bonfire of the Vanities") and the celebrity bio 
("Postcards From the Edge"). Sex is for sale, as always: Just last week, agent 
Irving "Swifty" Lazar resold "Lolita," the late Vladimir Nabokov's 1958 novel 
about an aging professor's obsession with a 12-year-old girl, to Carolco for $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The rising sales figures for books are long overdue, say authors and their 
agents, who point to the importance of a good story in the equation of a 
successful movie. "You put talent like Sean Connery and Dustin Hoffman in a 
movie and you've got a hit, right?" one writer says rhetorically. "No, what you 
have is 'Family Business,' " one of last Christmas season's box office flops. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the higher figures for books necessarily the result of new sales 
techniques or high pressure tactics on the part of agents. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of "Rush" last summer was said by some insiders to have been a 
manipulative achievement on the part of an agent, Amanda "Binky" Urban at ICM, 
who supposedly coaxed Richard Zanuck into the belief that the book had more 
heat on it than was in fact true. But Zanuck and other competing producers have 
denied this. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't blame the agents," says longtime producer and former MGM/UA chairman 
Lee Rich, who currently owns or controls the rights to 12 books, including five 
by best-selling horrormeister Dean R. Koontz. "If you don't want to pay it, 
don't pay it." 
</P>
<P>
"The studios make the marketplace," says Todd Harris, who has also pulled down 
six-figure sums for the first novels "Recruiting Violations" "A Time for 
Wedding Cake" and "Hype." 
</P>
<P>
"A good story will always sell. It doesn't matter whether it's by a 
best-selling author or not. If 'War of the Roses' didn't exist, ('Private 
Lies') would have sold for the same amount of money. It was a star-driven story 
that was very commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Harris claims not to utilize any special strategy or impose deadlines on 
potential buyers (a practice not uncommon in auctions of screenplays) but says 
most of his sales nevertheless come within 48 hours of submission. "I let the 
marketplace establish the time frame," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there are cases where the pace of the marketplace makes it hard even for 
the agents to keep up. It's not uncommon for eager producers not only to get 
hold of a book unofficially in advance of publication, but to try to represent 
the book to studios without having paid for the rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real swamp from where I sit," says Al Zuckerman, the New York agent for 
novelist Ken Follet who recalls how an established producer "ran all over 
town," meaning Los Angeles, with Follet's "Key to Rebecca" some years ago 
"pretending that he owned it when he didn't." Such tactics are made possible, 
Zuckerman adds, because "there's this whole system for stealing manuscripts 
from the minute they arrive at the publisher." 
</P>
<P>
The system is called "sneaking," and it involves secretaries, editorial 
assistants, copy store employees, book club personnel, trade publications that 
get books for early review, editors and even the writers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Explains Richard Curtiss, a New York literary agent: "There are people placed 
around the (publishing) business who, in exchange of quid pro quo -- in other 
words, favors -- will direct a copy of a manuscript that should be exclusive 
and confidential into the hands of a scout, and then that manuscript ends up on 
the desk of a producer. A mass market editor, for example, might trade a copy 
of a manuscript in exchange for first opportunity to acquire novelization 
rights to a hot film." 
</P>
<P>
What often happens next is that "readers" working for producers or studio story 
departments "cover" or synopsize the manuscript, evaluating its movie 
potential, a controversial practice generally resisted by agents. 
</P>
<P>
"People (in Hollywood) knew about this book of Zev's by the time I sold it to 
Random House," agent Esther Newberg says of the still untitled Chafets novel, 
which was bought by "Top Gun" producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. 
"What happens is that you have a very small window in which to try to sell the 
book before some 22-year-old kid reads it, doesn't like it and gives it bad 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Sneaking has even changed the way some agents do business. "If I have a hot 
literary property now," says Zuckerman, who is not atypical, "I don't deliver 
it to a publisher until I show it to movie people first." 
</P>
<P>
While Hollywood has ruined more than its share of novels ("In Country," "Bright 
Lights, Big City"), it has redeemed others ("Midnight Cowboy," "The Godfather") 
and made many novelists rich and others famous. Writers as diverse as Larry 
McMurtry ("The Last Picture Show," "Terms of Endearment") and Margaret Atwood 
("A Handmaid's Tale") became much better known as novelists because Hollywood 
bought their books. A movie might misfire commercially -- statistically, most 
do -- yet still generate considerable publicity among the more modest-sized 
book-buying audience. 
</P>
<P>
Al Zuckerman estimates that the 1981 movie based on Ken Follet's thriller "Eye 
of the Needle," though not a success, sold an additional 1.5 million copies of 
the novel. 
</P>
<P>
The movie deal for Margaret Atwood's dark fable "A Handmaid's Tale" prompted a 
1 million-copy reissue of the book in paperback, according to her publishing 
agent, Phoebe Larmore, and made it a bestseller all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Adler, who spent 20 years as a Washington businessman, had written 15 
books in relative obscurity until James L. Brooks bought the rights to his 1981 
novel "War of the Roses" and turned it over to screenwriter Michael Leeson and 
director Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
A cautionary tale about a contemporary marriage twisted by greed, "War of the 
Roses" was optioned prior to publication, as it happens, by Richard Zanuck and 
his then partner David Brown, for $35,000. They paid Adler to write a 
screenplay, but the project languished, and by the time 20th Century Fox bought 
the book for Brooks six years later, the price had gone up to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The kinds of books I write apparently are the kinds of things these fellows 
like out here," says Adler, 61, who has had five other books sold or optioned 
for films (though none produced). 
</P>
<P>
Adler has been critical of producers and studios in the past, but he is the 
first to acknowledge that Hollywood has made him a literary star. " 'War of the 
Roses' has been published in every country in the world now. That's what 
happens once a book is set to be a movie. A worldwide movie is the best 
promotion for a book imaginable because movie people are the best promoters of 
anything. They really know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kem Nunn has lived for six years largely on the movie sale of "Tapping the 
Source" -- considerably more than he has made from book royalties. While it's 
been "frustrating," he says, that no movie has been made, the money allowed him 
to write another novel, "Unassigned Territory." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone has heard of Tulsa, Okla., novelist Jay Cronley, but six of his 
books, including "Funny Farm," "Quick Change" and "False Labor," have been sold 
or optioned to marquee talent such as Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and Barry 
Levinson. Cronley's novels sell on average only 5,000 to 10,000 copies -- not 
much in publishing terms -- but his agent estimates he has made "10 times more" 
money from movie sales. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that many publishing houses and movie studios are now owned by the 
same conglomerates -- Paramount and Simon &amp; Schuster are jointly owned by 
Paramount Communications, for example; Warner Bros. and Little-Brown by 
Time-Warner Inc. -- apparently has not been a factor in the accelerated 
book-to-movie process. The story departments for the studios want the best 
movie books they can get, regardless of the publisher, and authors' agents have 
no reason to favor one studio over another except the one offering the most 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Zanuck, who was head of production at 20th Century Fox from 1962-70 and 
later bought "Jaws" (for $175,000) from Peter Benchley, says the market for 
film rights is "very cyclical. I remember when books were really in for a long 
while. In the '60s books were selling (to Hollywood) like hot cakes. Now, it's 
heated up again. Maybe it's because there are less original quality 
screenplays. You don't find 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' very often." 
</P>
<P>
Zanuck and Brown paid $400,000 in 1967 for William Goldman's "Butch Cassidy and 
the Sundance Kid," then a record for an original screenplay. The new record was 
set when the Geffen Co. in April purchased a script, "The Last Boy Scout," by 
Shane Black, the author of "Lethal Weapon," for $1.75 million -- which is still 
less than was paid in 1979 by United Artists for the film rights to Gay 
Talese's nonfiction book about sex in America, "Thy Neighbor's Wife." That 
figure, $2.5 million, is believed to be the largest amount ever paid for a book 
of any kind. And, since none of three movies UA executives Steven Bach and 
David Fields said they hoped to get from "Thy Neighbor's Wife" ever 
materialized, the sum is thought to represent a high folly mark that led to a 
cooling off of the literary marketplace during the first half of the 1980s, a 
period also marked by soaring interest rates and industry labor troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The market took an upturn in 1986 when MGM/UA paid $1 million to buy Scott 
Turow's courtroom thriller "Presumed Innocent" for producer-director Sydney 
Pollack (who later took it with him to Universal), and Warner Bros. paid $1.3 
million for a first novel by Harry Saint, "Memoirs of an Invisible Man," 
intended as a vehicle for Chevy Chase though yet to be made. The escalation has 
continued up through "Rush" and "Private Lies," but some writers and publishers 
point out that these and other million-dollar sales are still the high-end 
exception, and have not turned all eyes in the book business toward the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the titles mentioned above, most books that draw interest from 
Hollywood, like most original scripts, begin with the much smaller sums of 
option money -- that is, a down payment made by a producer or studio toward a 
larger purchase price that is only paid if the movie is ever made. Agents claim 
that option money is rising in the current market, but in the not so distant 
past the average novel that was not a bestseller could often be had by a 
producer for as little as $2,500 against a purchase price of $25,000-$40,000. 
At those levels, a screenwriter might easily make more for adapting a book than 
the novelist got for either writing it or selling the rights. 
</P>
<P>
Since movie companies option maybe 2,000 books a year, of which only a few 
dozen, or roughly 5%, are ever made into feature films, the hubbub of Hollywood 
sounds not nearly so loud in Midtown Manhattan as it does in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Movie people are notorious for wasting a lot of your time and then it ends up 
only being an option," says Phyllis Fleiss, director of media rights for Crown 
Publishers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, publishers don't have quite the incentive in these negotiations as 
do writers since in most contracts writers retain a lion's share of any film 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand," Fleiss says, "It helps to be able to say (to book clubs 
and paperback houses), 'We've got a movie. It never hurts. It's just another 
form of publicity." 
</P>
<P>
These days, film producers sometimes even kick in money for a book's 
advertising budget in the hope of helping to make it a bestseller, as Carolco 
has promised to do for whatever publisher buys D. Keith Mano's new novel, 
"Topless," which Carolco bought recently for $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
Movie companies also sometimes agree to what are known as "bestseller bumpers," 
meaning they agree to pay an author extra money for each week that a book they 
purchase remains on the New York Times bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lee Rich and others, the days of the 10% option are over. "Options 
are going for big money," says Rich. "It's more like $100,000 against $500,000. 
Options are where the big increase has come. So many books never found their 
way to the screen, I guess the writers and their agents figured, 'Let's get the 
money up front.' " 
</P>
<P>
A recent example of the newer kind of deal was the Pleshette-Green Agency's 
sale of Neal Stephenson's novel "Zodiac," about a New Age Sam Spade hunting 
down criminal polluters of Boston Harbor, to Warner Bros. for $370,000 cash, 
with an additional $370,000 to be paid if the movie ever goes into production. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Gotler, a leading book rights agent, recently sold "The Plummer," a 
nonfiction book about the man who destroyed the Philadelphia Mafia, by Joseph 
Salerno and Stephen J. Rivele, to Universal for a $400,000 option, plus 
$450,000 more if the movie is made. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Pleshette, the agent who made the "Zodiac" sale, is one of those who 
believe books are benefitting from the sludge pile of screenplays that has 
accumulated over the last decade -- a pile raised high by an excess of studio 
"development" deals and a new generation of screenwriters nourished on a 
restricted diet of television and movies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real problem with original screenplays now," says Pleshette, who has 
made movie and miniseries deals for novelists William Kennedy, Sue Miller and 
Valerie Martin, among others. "The young people (screenwriters) coming up are 
so derivative. When I read original screenplays, they're almost always like 
something that's been done. Or they're a cross between two other movies -- 
'Lethal Weapon' meets 'Wuthering Heights.' " 
</P>
<P>
That so many original screenplays are written in the vicinity of Los Angeles 
and its sometimes all-consuming movie business atmosphere, the agent suggests, 
only contributes to the dearth of originality. "Producers are looking for a 
point of view that's not between Encino and Pacific Palisades," she says. "Most 
of the books we get, there is a vision, there is a voice." 
</P>
<P>
Novelists, who work in a less restrictive medium, are not so closely aligned 
with Southern California as a rule and are less prone to the Hollywood disease 
of trying to anticipate trends -- the sort of creative thinking that propels 
screenwriters to pound out the next body-switching comedy or space Western or 
whatever their agents think is selling this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Books are the area where unusual stories come from," says ICM's Newberg. "So 
many novelists I know are better writers than screenwriters." 
</P>
<P>
While a book is of no use to a movie producer until a screenwriter has been 
paid to adapt it to the different demands of film, the raw material of fiction 
is often more alluring to moneyed movie people than any but the best original 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"Books are a known quantity and have already been tested by an audience," says 
Triad's Judy Clain. "You attract strong talent and directors with good 
material. Books are classy. And a book could become anything -- as opposed to a 
bad script." 
</P>
<P>
And so it is that in Hollywood, where the screenplay is the primary literary 
form, the novel retains its mystique and market value. To all but publishing's 
biggest cash register stars like Stephen King, Tom Clancy and Danielle Steele 
(for whom even a $1 million movie sale might qualify as supplementary income), 
movie money and attention is harder than ever to ignore. Because of 
videocassettes, cable and growing foreign sales, the stakes have never been 
higher in Hollywood, which one way or another must keep discovering new sources 
of fuel to keep its high-octane engines running and can well afford to pay 
higher prices at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
The prices have reached such a level that it's increasingly difficult for 
producers without access to big studio money (and spies in New York) to secure 
options to desirable material. Hall Bartlett, who directed and produced the 
adaptation of "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" in 1973 and "Children of Sanchez" 
in 1979, became so frustrated in his attempts to get the rights to another 
best-selling book, he decided to write his own novel specifically for the 
purpose of selling it as a miniseries. So far his plan has only been 
half-successful: Random House published the book, "The Rest of Our Lives," but 
it failed to become a bestseller and no miniseries resulted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting business," observes Warren Adler. "It's like wildcatting in 
the oil fields. There's no sure thing. How do you hook into the public mind?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite getting rich and famous from "War of the Roses" and "Private Lies," 
Adler makes clear that to his way of thinking, movies remain secondary. He sees 
them mainly as an extension of his books. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't write my books for the movies. The money is great but more important 
than the money is people taking my books seriously. I'm shooting for my books 
to last. Otherwise I couldn't spend all those days alone in a room doing this. 
But it's what I love. I love novels. It's a one-on-one communication system. 
The novel is still to me the greatest art form in the world."

HOLLYWOOD'S LOST GENERATION OF WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
A WEALTH OF TALENT GOES UNCHALLENGED AND UNAPPRECIATED AS THE FILM INDUSTRY 
GIVES TODAY'S ACTRESSES FEW MEATY ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In "Pretty Woman," Julia Roberts plays a minty-fresh hooker who finds true love 
with her wealthy john. In "Miami Blues," Jennifer Jason Leigh's hooker is a 
perky, girl-next-door type who yearns for homespun married bliss with a 
psychopathic trick. In "Last Exit to Brooklyn," Jason Leigh is a tough-tender 
streetwalker who lures unsuspecting galoots to their doom. 
</P>
<P>
What does it say about Hollywood that, of all the roles being offered actresses 
right now, these three are probably the juiciest? Women are such an endangered 
species in the movies that the vamp has become high concept. 
</P>
<P>
There have probably never been as many gifted actresses in America as there are 
right now, but their gifts have been allowed to flourish almost exclusively in 
the theater or on television. On stage, performers like Mercedes Ruehl ("Other 
People's Money") and Joan Allen ("Burn This") and Patti Lu Pone ("Evita") are 
electrifying. On television, you watch Annette O'Toole in "The Kennedys of 
Massachusetts" in a state of rapt admiration. When these same actresses show up 
in films, it's likely to be in scrunched-up bit roles: Ruehl had a dismally 
strait-laced cameo as a sympathetic shrink in "Crazy People"; Lu Pone was 
shoehorned into "Driving Miss Daisy"; Allen was an extended blip on the screen 
in such films as "Tucker" and "In Country." O'Toole was harrowing as a 
distraught wife in "Love at Large" -- for all of her 10 (count 'em) minutes of 
screen time. 
</P>
<P>
Even the actresses well known -- honored -- for their past film work are likely 
nowadays to be playing blurry back-ups to the male lead. In "Bird on a Wire," 
Goldie Hawn appears to have entered a boodie-shaking contest with Mel Gibson. 
(Worse, she loses the contest.) Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler are the 
female stars with the greatest clout, but Streisand is just now about to begin 
filming her first film in three years, and Midler has turned into a weepy 
self-parody. Even her silly, wiggly walks lack spring. 
</P>
<P>
It's heartbreaking to scan the pool of great (or potentially great) actresses 
out there: Not just the famous ones, like Jessica Lange and Debra Winger and 
Michelle Pfeiffer, but the scores of the less renowned -- Maria Conchita 
Alonso, Bridget Fonda, Joan Cusack, Joan Chen, Pamela Reed, Lena Olin, Natasha 
Richardson, Anjelica Huston, Christine Lahti, Dianne Wiest, Laurie Metcalfe, 
Ellen Barkin, Kathy Bates -- to mention only a handful. The embarrassment in 
this embarrassment of riches is that these actresses, all primed for major 
careers, are entombed in Hollywood's development-deal dungeons. An entire 
generation of female performers is being squelched by an industry that finds no 
percentage in accommodating their talents. And by repeatedly going buddy-buddy 
or solo, an entire generation of male performers is being squelched, too. 
</P>
<P>
Things were not always this bad. Until the past several decades, women were as 
integral to the movies as men; female stars were as hallowed as their male 
counterparts. Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess were equally revered. Greta 
Garbo hogged as much of the glory as John Gilbert. The goddesses, like Joan 
Crawford and Lana Turner, were, in their heyday, as big a box-office draw as 
the gods, like Gable and Bogart. Their salaries were commensurate, too; money 
is always a tip-off to what Hollywood thinks of you. The roles of Hollywood's 
Golden Age goddesses may not have been any more complex or advanced than the 
roles offered today's top stars (although many of them were), but at least 
there were far more of them, and the characterizations, because they were 
designed to fulfill people's fantasies, meant something special to audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The old studio system was responsible for many travesties, but most of the 
memorable movie goddesses, from Garbo and Dietrich through Gardner and Monroe, 
were creations of that system. The studio's stable of writers and directors and 
cinematographers and costume designers were allowed to work up intensely 
creative partnerships with performers. The studio machinery was geared up for 
the long run of an actor's career. Aging beauties were eased into more 
"realistic" roles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an actress who has passed unrecognized into her 30s stands almost no 
chance of making it, because in that age bracket the roles just aren't there 
for her to be discovered. And even the actresses who do achieve success in 
their 20s and 30s often find they've been put out to pasture later on. The 
vital female stars of only a decade or so ago, like Jill Clayburgh and Ellen 
Burstyn and Cicely Tyson, are, for all intents and purposes, in a state of 
involuntary semi-retirement from the movies. Like their younger counterparts, 
the ones without movie work, they reserve their occasional successes these days 
for the stage or TV. It's as if their movie careers never happened. 
</P>
<P>
The free-agency of the current, post-studio-system era has not been kind to the 
creation of movie stars. Left to their own devices, many stars choose projects 
that are almost comically wrong for them (like Jane Fonda's spinster gringa in 
"Old Gringo," or Dustin Hoffman as Sean Connery's son in "Family Business"). 
But male stars at least have a surplus of decent roles to fight over, since 
virtually all of the "important" movies, and most of the unimportant ones, are 
written expressly for them. With women, what's left after Meryl Streep goes 
shopping? 
</P>
<P>
The movie business is increasingly being driven by the blockbuster mentality, 
and blockbusters are almost always action epics in which women are relegated to 
a status position somewhere between the hardware and the special effects. The 
true partnership in these films is between man and machine. The production 
costs are rising -- "Total Recall" and "Die Hard 2," for example, both 
reportedly around $60 million. At a time when foreign markets are becoming 
almost as lucrative as domestic ones, it makes commercial sense to stock these 
films with American stars who have international appeal. And that invariably 
means male action heroes. Don't count on seeing "Batwoman" any time soon 
(particularly after the smashing success of "Supergirl"). 
</P>
<P>
For women in the movies, their heroism is reserved almost entirely for the 
emotional arena, where the triumphs are less photogenic -- i.e. less saleable. 
Occasionally you get something like Sigourney Weaver as an intergalactic Mother 
Courage battling aliens, but most female action heroines are simply women 
recast in standard male scenarios, like the lady cops of "Blue Steel" and 
"Impulse." 
</P>
<P>
The scant supply of meaningful roles for women isn't only a product of the 
blockbuster mentality; it's equally linked to Hollywood's avoidance of what is 
disparagingly referred to as "women's issues." The conflicts of contemporary 
women don't fit neatly into the standard Hollywood story lines, and in today's 
Hollywood, neatness counts. The disarray of modern relationships is confusing 
and threatening -- that is to say, uncommercial -- to studio heads. And these 
days, with the demise of most of the small independent companies, the studios 
are practically the only game in town. Since the new conflicts are not readily 
marketable, and the old conflicts, in a contemporary setting at least, are 
moldy, the studio solution has been to can the conflicts altogether. 
</P>
<P>
On television, where projects can move into production faster and where there 
is less at stake commercially than in the movies, one is much more likely to 
see honest depictions of women's emotional lives, even the messier aspects; one 
is also much more likely to see, especially in the never-never-land of the 
soaps, the kind of old-fashioned romantic scenarios that thrived in the '40s 
and '50s. There's something for everyone, and if the TV shows are no good, 
there's still the great old romantic movies on view on cable TV, a spectral 
reminder of what once was. 
</P>
<P>
It's no accident that virtually the only movies to offer full-scale roles for 
women these days are the ones either set in the past, like "Enemies, a Love 
Story" and "Dangerous Liaisons" and "Driving Miss Daisy," or else in some 
dream-time present, like "The Fabulous Baker Boys," which draws on our romantic 
notions about the past as filtered through the movies. The pastness of these 
movies functions as a kind of shield from contemporary concerns, and yet, 
because many of them feature a real avidity for sexual and emotional conflict, 
they seem more alive, more in the present tense, than many of the contemporary 
movies. ("Enemies," set in 1949, is a lot more vital than, say, the modern-day 
"Stanley &amp; Iris" or "Stella," both of which might have emerged from the 
'30s.) 
</P>
<P>
The truly contemporary movies that attempt to show off "modern" conflicts often 
end up schizzy and retrograde. "Baby Boom" proffered an impossible fantasy; it 
said women could be CEOs and homemakers and land Mr. Right, all at the same 
time. "Working Girl" featured a heroine, Melanie Griffith's Tess, who was both 
ditz and whiz; she reaches the top because of her business smarts but also, 
although the film doesn't point it up, because (unbeknown to her) she sleeps 
with the right guy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the weirdest hybrid fantasy around is the aforementioned "Pretty 
Woman." If you bother to take this retooled "Pygmalion" seriously, you might 
balk at the dubiousness of its dual protagonists: Julia Roberts' Vivian, the 
happy hooker with a heart of gold, and Richard Gere's corporate raider with a 
heart of gold. Cliches old and new, both crocks. The film is a smash hit, but 
it's also provoked more vehemence from moviegoers I've heard from than any 
other current film I can recall. It confirms a dirty little truth: retrograde 
fantasies still hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian could have been something else besides a prostitute and the film would 
still have fulfilled its fairy tale aspirations. And yet, in the current movie 
climate, it makes perfect sense that she is one. The film solves the problem of 
how to create a modern romantic relationship by making it strictly cash and 
carry (at first). The film is like a reversal of those gold-digger comedies 
where Marilyn Monroe cajoled the Corporate Man into loving his millions -- in 
order, of course, to lavish them on her. In "Pretty Woman," Vivian shames her 
john into looking beyond his millions (while still reaping their benefits). 
"Pretty Woman" functions as a warped Prince Charming fantasy for women while, 
for upscale men, it offers the reassuring life lesson that women aren't just 
after them for their money. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to imply that actresses should only play "politically correct" 
parts. As a matter of fact, most roles worth playing are politically incorrect. 
Who would argue with Jane Fonda's performance in "Klute"? Or, for that matter, 
with Julia Roberts' amazing work in "Pretty Woman," or Jennifer Jason Leigh's 
in her two current films. But the sudden influx of these roles is, I think, 
part of a long-term industry-wide retreat from feminist concerns. At the root 
of these concerns is the old male bugaboo: Can women be trusted -- as business 
associates, as sex partners, wives? As equals? The answer usually takes the 
form these days of a brutal put-down. The implication of a film like "Pretty 
Woman" is that Vivian is a hooker not because of degraded economic necessity 
but because she chooses to be one -- because she deserves to be one. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate post-World War II era, women who had entered the work force 
during the war found themselves cast out and replaced by returning veterans. 
Hollywood responded to the problem by concocting fantasy goddesses -- the 
pneumatic, walking, talking pin-ups who reached their apotheosis in Marilyn 
Monroe. Their cheesecake glamour, totally without threat, was a kind of 
antidote to the anxieties of the times. 
</P>
<P>
In today's sexually confused society, Hollywood's response to feminism can't be 
as blithely concocted as in those va-va-va-voom days. As a result, there are 
very few, if any, "pure" sex sirens on screen today, certainly none who are 
major stars (Madonna probably comes closest). Male stars, because their appeal 
is more simplified and comprehensible, have even taken over the pin-up function 
from women. The latest films of Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy 
practically dispense with female co-stars altogether. They're self-infatuated 
swoon-a-thons. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamism of many of Hollywood's legendary actresses, like Bette Davis and 
Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, often carried a threat even when their 
roles didn't. And it's often been the case in the past that men, more so than 
women, responded to these stars. Men don't usually go for the ladylike types; 
paradoxically, they seem to want more of a challenge from their female stars 
than do the women in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
But the only dynamic, threatening women in the movies right now are the 
crazies. Their conflicts may develop from a realistic base, like Glenn Close's 
spurned avenger in "Fatal Attraction" or Kathleen Turner's miserably unhappy 
wife in "The War of the Roses," but invariably these characters spin off into a 
self-immolating, horror-flick rage. Even a "role-model" heroine like Sigourney 
Weaver's Dian Fossey in "Gorillas in the Mist" is made to seem inhumanly 
obsessed with her mission. Her heroism comes across as lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody recognizes that the movies reflect shifting attitudes in society, but 
that doesn't mean that those attitudes automatically show up in the movies. At 
least not right away. There's a built-in time lag in the way Hollywood 
confronts social upheavals -- look at how long it took to get Vietnam on the 
screen -- and never more so than in these dog days of the bottom line. 
Hollywood's solution to the "woman problem" may yet result in a compensatory 
avalanche of strong, complex, smart, funny female portrayals. In the meantime, 
this waiting game is excruciating.

THE ART THAT DARES NOT SPEAK ITS NAME; 
</P>
<P>
A LINE RUNS FROM TODAY'S CONTROVERSIAL IMAGES BACK THROUGH THE WORKS OF 
MAPPLETHORPE, WARHOL, POLLOCK AND BENTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't breathe a word to the people of Cincinnati -- you might find yourself 
under indictment if you do -- but sex and sexuality have been central to art 
for at least 10,000 years, give or take a few. So let's talk about art and sex 
for a moment, and especially about art and the kind of sex that dares not speak 
its name. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to discern that the ballistic missiles 
launched against the art of the late Robert Mapplethorpe have been fueled by a 
loathing for homosexuality. The artist was openly gay, and his work includes 
frank pictures. The furious objection to federal funding of their display is 
that it constitutes inappropriate government sanction for homosexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is politics as usual. Nonetheless, something extraordinary is 
happening. The deftly orchestrated attack actually threatens to bring down an 
entire federal agency. The National Endowment for the Arts, whose whopping 
successes of the last 25 years stand virtually unparalleled amid the waste and 
corruption more typically left by bureaucracies, may not survive the year. 
</P>
<P>
By wide margins, polls show firm public support for federal funding of the 
arts, without content restrictions or direct congressional interference. Still, 
there's a good chance that the agency will be fatally compromised, if not 
destroyed outright. This sharply contradictory state of affairs demonstrates 
two things. One is the fearsome power of prejudice as a political tool in the 
United States today. The other is the special status of homosexuality in our 
nation's long and inglorious history of intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
The relationships between American art and the politics of repression as it 
pertains to homosexuality are only just beginning to be studied. The body of 
scholarship remains small and fragmented, and no comprehensive thesis has yet 
emerged. Sometimes, though, the chance juxtaposition of those fragments brings 
a slightly larger picture into view. 
</P>
<P>
That's precisely what has happened in the last several months. The accidental 
coming together in Southern California of two exhibitions that have been 
traveling the country since 1989 -- one featuring Thomas Hart Benton, the other 
Andy Warhol -- has conspired to tell us much about the history behind the 
travails of the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. Add the January publication of an unusually insightful biography of 
Jackson Pollock and a good deal of light has lately been shed. The sweep of 
half a century of American cultural life begins to take newly coherent shape. 
</P>
<P>
Visually, the work of these four artists couldn't be more diverse. But 
chronologically, they form a chain of unusual interest. From the 1930s to the 
1950s, Benton and Pollock are paradigms for the establishment of an American 
art scene that came from obscurity to international acclaim. From the 1960s to 
the 1980s, Warhol and Mapplethorpe were central participants in changing the 
direction of that art. The repression of sex and sexuality is pivotal to the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, "Thomas Hart Benton: An American 
Original" is a sprawling show. It chronicles the work of an artist who 
pompously cast himself as a modern Michelangelo for a democratic people but who 
in fact emerges as a skillful if unwitting caricaturist. 
</P>
<P>
Often hugely scaled, his mannered, cartoon-like paintings are chiefly of 
interest as a record of the sorrowful nightmare haunting the American spirit, 
especially during the traumatic years of the Great Depression. Benton climbed 
to prominence in that troubled time. His robust misogyny and outspoken 
vilification of homosexuals, which are the stuff of legend, exploited the 
fearful insecurities of a nation in collapse. 
</P>
<P>
These oppressive values were pictured in Benton's raucous paintings of everyday 
American life. They're not so different from the values that opponents use 
against Mapplethorpe's work today. How this turnabout occurred is dramatized in 
the aesthetic shift from Pollock to Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
Benton's most famous and significant pupil, and the artist who, more than any 
other, became a postwar symbol of American supremacy in the visual arts, is the 
subject of "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga," an exceptional new biography by 
Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The famous abstract drip-paintings that Pollock eventually made were radically 
different from Benton's cartoonish images, which typically focused on the "men 
of action" who, in his parochial view, had been primarily responsible for 
building the nation. But Pollock's idealized relationship with his teacher was 
crucial. Benton's exaggerated masculinity, along with his artistic aspirations, 
brought together personality traits divided between Pollock's own father and 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
The severe repressiveness of the American artistic milieu of the period is 
important to understand. The authors recount a typical event. It turns on the 
marginal place of art in traditional American life. 
</P>
<P>
On a summer day in the early 1950s, Pollock was relaxing at the beach near East 
Hampton, Long Island, with fellow painters Franz Kline and Syd Solomon. "We 
were bemoaning the lack of interest in art among most Americans," Solomon told 
the authors. Someone joked that, if all else failed, they could "just chuck it 
all and go teach old ladies to do watercolors." 
</P>
<P>
Like others of their generation, these artists knew full well that most 
Americans regarded art as frivolous and unmanly -- as old ladies' business. 
"They had inherited an aesthetic world shaped by Victorian sentiment," Naifeh 
and Smith write, "and administered, almost exclusively, by women. Men who 
strayed into that world were considered, at best, unproductive, at worst, 
homosexual, by those outside it." 
</P>
<P>
From Benton on, aggressively macho posing functioned as a compensatory cover 
for male artists. So did the general expulsion of women -- except for 
reputation-saving wives and girlfriends -- from among the ranks of acceptable 
painters and sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
And so did the rhetoric describing works of art such as Pollock's energetic 
drip-paintings, rhetoric that was a paean to their muscularity, force, action 
and power. These were precisely the artistic attributes that Benton, too, had 
championed, albeit in figurative rather than abstract terms. 
</P>
<P>
Laboring under Benton's domineering parental shadow, Pollock's painfully 
conflicted psyche was surely impacted by the likelihood of several youthful 
homosexual experiences, persuasively documented by Naifeh and Smith. Isolating 
specific psychological traits as the fuel for an artist's particular forms can 
be risky. But there can be no doubt that, in his art, Pollock vigorously 
attempted to free himself from 
</P>
<P>
the constricting aesthetic bonds of the day. Riddled with the nervous energy of 
anxiety and alienation, his paintings escaped the one-dimensionality of his 
teacher's art. 
</P>
<P>
This struggle with restrictiveness and suffocating convention, a struggle 
embodied in Abstract Expressionist art, was the burden of history in the years 
that established the United States as global leader. And it was the very burden 
Andy Warhol began to shake off, with startling paintings that mocked the 
vaunted rhetoric of Abstract Expressionist painting. 
</P>
<P>
The marvelous show of early graphic work by the late Warhol, seen this winter 
at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, focused on his award-winning commercial art 
of the 1950s. It laid the groundwork for the great Pop paintings of the 1960s, 
and its backdrop was the era marked by the stratospheric rise of Jackson 
Pollock's reputation. (The brawling, hard-drinking, self-styled cowboy died in 
a gruesome car crash in 1956, at age 44.) The show made plain how Warhol, an 
effeminate homosexual artist who was denied entry into the bullish, macho realm 
of New York School artists, brilliantly managed to subvert the discriminatory 
milieu and usurp center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Although celebrated and successful within the world of commercial art, which 
the Abstract Expressionist vanguard demeaned as low-culture kitsch, Warhol was 
no stranger to the deprivations of second-class status. Homely, gay, raised in 
a poor working-class family in Pittsburgh, he had scant reason to embrace 
Abstract Expressionist cliches of existential freedom. 
</P>
<P>
So, about 1960 Warhol began to employ the devices of advertising and mass media 
to represent those cliches, themselves noteworthy products of the American 
saga. Actual cartoons of men of action -- Dick Tracy, Superman, Popeye -- 
recalled Benton's cartoonish style of representation, but honestly and without 
Michelangelo-esque pretension. 
</P>
<P>
As eloquent assertions of personal liberty, Warhol's disarming Pop paintings 
galvanized attention. The new American world of "high art" may have been 
exalted in the 1950s, but its celebration of ideal freedom had clashed with the 
vulgar reality of its exclusionary social milieu. Suddenly, the mantle of 
all-American original was his. 
</P>
<P>
Many contemporaries were quick to dismiss Pop as mere surface glitz, but 
subsequent generations of artists grasped its deeper meaning. For photography, 
the young Robert Mapplethorpe was among them. His pictures managed a feat 
clearly derived from Warhol's own. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1920s, the camera-work most celebrated in America had been an 
aesthetic sometimes called the new realism but more widely was known as 
straight photography. A crisp, precise, unmanipulated style of picture-making 
had been established as indispensable by Edward Weston, Paul Strand, Imogen 
Cunningham and others. Mapplethorpe mastered the style and echoed his 
predecessors' work in exquisite floral close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
He also turned their new realism toward an even newer reality. The triple focus 
of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s -- blacks, women and homosexual men 
-- are the principal subjects of Mapplethorpe's photographic portraits. 
</P>
<P>
How did the artist portray these marginalized people? His blacks are almost 
always prodigiously virile, and they sometimes are paired with white women. 
Typically, his women are strong and powerful. His homosexual men flaunt 
themselves, sometimes enacting their social bondage in sadomasochistic garb. 
</P>
<P>
If these compositional choices sound stereotypical, or cliched, that's because 
they are. Mapplethorpe used straight photography the way Warhol used mass 
media. He pictured, with clarity, oppressive stereotypes created by the 
dominant, or "straight," society. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most irrational and outrageous of those stereotypes is pictured in 
his now infamous self-portrait with a bull whip that protrudes, tail-like, from 
his rectum. A target of hysterical disdain in the current NEA controversy, this 
picture is indeed ghoulish. But the image has special meaning for the 
censorship drama that has been unfolding for the last year, a meaning that so 
far has been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Uncannily, the photograph conjures the vile and demeaning slur faggot. The 
origin of the slur is the French word for a bundle of sticks, or fagot, piled 
as fuel at the base of the stake when "devil-possessed" heretics were burned by 
religious clerics in medieval Europe. The photographic image assembles familiar 
motifs -- eyes glaring, smile leering, goatee pointed and punishing "tail" 
unfurling -- to create a picture of the devil incarnate. The stereotype 
pictured by Mapplethorpe's self-portrait is that homosexuals are cursed by 
Satan. 
</P>
<P>
Cruel irony therefore surrounds the use of that photograph today in 
condemnations of the National Endowment for the Arts. The explicitly political 
drama of the Mapplethorpe affair has been generated by the religious right, by 
way of a direct mail campaign to Congress and clergy, led by a Methodist 
minister from Tupelo, Miss.; a bully pulpit exploited by a U.S. senator who has 
long been chief Washington nemesis of gay men and women; and a fundamentalist 
cable television network, which has repeatedly broadcast evangelical opinion on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the assault is unsurprising. The evangelical right, which rode 
higher during the early period of the Reagan era than it ever has before, has 
suffered a precipitous decline in political power in the last few years as sex 
scandals wracked its hierarchies. To repair an image ruined by hypocrisy, a 
"moral war" was needed to fight -- and win. 
</P>
<P>
The reliable bugaboo of "godless homosexuality" made a useful battleground, 
especially as the equally tried-and-true bogeyman of "godless communism" had 
evaporated. When the Rev. Pat Robertson rails against the NEA for supporting 
Mapplethorpe he can appear to be diligently casting out the same sins that 
disgraced Jim Bakker, his felonious predecessor. Sacrilege, or the intentional 
desecration of a sacred idea, was candidly alleged in the attack on Andres 
Serrano's photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in urine, but it applies 
as well to a pious rejection of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe's photograph gave shocking visual form to the demonized image 
fabricated for homosexuals by an oppressive society. Medieval Europe is long 
gone, but the continuing relevance of this insightful work of art is succinctly 
demonstrated by an April 19 editorial in the Arizona Republic. Dennis Barrie, 
director of Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center, was indicted in April on 
charges of obscenity for showing Mapplethorpe's photographs at his museum. The 
editorial speaks to the charge of using minors in pornography, a charge which 
arose from separate photographs of a naked boy and a partially clad girl. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath a biblical quotation from II Corinthians -- "Where the spirit of the 
Lord is, there is liberty" -- the artist is rhetorically burned at the stake 
for the crime of pedophilia. "Mr. Barrie may think that putting kiddie porn on 
display is a matter of artistic integrity," the editorial concludes, "but the 
truth refuses to go away; and the truth is that Mr. Mapplethorpe, a man of 
undeniable skill, exploited small children, for which he conceivably might have 
been prosecuted had he not died of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to say whether the editorialist's "truth" would also condemn 
Edward Weston to the flames -- or Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, 
Harry Callahan, Jan Saudek, Minor White or any other great artist who has 
photographed undraped children. But Mapplethorpe is distinct from most in the 
history of photographers: An open homosexual, he can be tarred with the 
scariest lie of all, which falsely claims gay men as inveterate child 
molesters. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial's final, gratuitous reference to AIDS is telling. From the start, 
this medical condition has been superstitiously portrayed by the evangelical 
right as divine retribution for unspeakable sins. Its invocation is wholly 
superfluous to the editorial -- try reading the sentence without the last two 
words -- but its inclusion subtly reinforces the prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
As the Great Depression did for Benton, the well-documented panic over AIDS is 
what has created fertile ground for today's exploitation of deeply entrenched 
homophobia in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A controversy over art that, in the all too recent past, dared not speak its 
name, puts freedom of expression squarely on the line. In the Cincinnati courts 
and in the halls of Congress, a longstanding American drama of personal liberty 
continues to be played out.

Each city receives its form from the desert it opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italo Calvino, "Invisible Cities" 
</P>
<P>
When a restaurant "works," chances are that most happy customers don't analyze 
why. A couple of apercus might be tossed about in the car: The food was 
delicious, the service was good. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely, though, do we scrutinize how the physical environment contributes to 
having a good time. Great spaces tend to transmit their magic subliminally. The 
magic is no accident, though; more often than not, it's the result of an 
architect's canny, precisely engineered dream. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has never lacked restaurants that functioned as gathering places. 
In fact, whole eras might be documented simply by doing an oral history of 
Chasen's, Romanoff's, Ma Maison, Ben Frank's, Canter's and the Source. But the 
crowd of high-spirited, great-looking restaurants that's sprung up in the last 
few years has reached a sort of critical mass. It has been about more than just 
fabulous food, and it has gone beyond merely mirroring the ripening of Los 
Angeles. Restaurant culture has come to have an impact on the city's creative 
energy in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is in its growth mode in every area, from the most physical to the 
most metaphysical," says architect Michael Rotondi. "This place is a creative 
catalyst now. The city's filled with adventurous people who need a lot of 
stimulation. I think restaurants have really been one of the critical 
ingredients to this consummation of society." 
</P>
<P>
While much was made of the "restaurant as theater" metaphor several years ago 
-- the venue as a high-toned place to see and be seen -- every architect we 
spoke with pointed out that two gods must be obeyed: Dining out must offer 
simultaneously a sense of being in a public realm and a sense of privacy. The 
ritual of Going Out to Eat, while including relaxing, recharging and smooching 
under candlelight, is also about collective experience, about recognizing and 
being with a community. 
</P>
<P>
New York Times restaurant critic Bryan Miller has called big-city restaurants 
"living rooms for the middle class." Do the new restaurants in Los Angeles 
really serve as living rooms? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles architect Elyse Grinstein thinks so. "When you go into a 
restaurant, you should feel it's your own special place, as if you were 
entertaining in your own home. I love walking into West Beach and feeling it's 
my place. Or into Chaya or Musso's. I feel like I belong all over town." 
</P>
<P>
This feeling of belonging may have a special importance in Los Angeles, where 
what sociologists call face-to-face interaction occurs far less frequently than 
in more compact, traditionally organized cities. Many of the architects agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we need any more ultra-turbocharged, overly architectonic 
space," says Steven Ehrlich. "We need gathering places, catalysts for the 
unexpected encounter. That's what urbanism is all about, and restaurants serve 
that function in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
If restaurants are "living rooms," they're the kind you'd find on stage. The 
diner is simultaneously in the play and part of the audience. Without the 
small-town village green, the line of front porches or, for most people, the 
rarefied private club, restaurants offer a sort of instant "membership" in an 
unchartered, but very real, society -- at least for as long as you're there. 
</P>
<P>
It's emblematic that one of the last decade's most vigorous dialogues (in the 
film "My Dinner With Andre") took place on a restaurant banquette. Booths are 
one way many architects are structuring space for that perfect private/public 
fit. That was the reason for the booths at Kate Mantilini's, says Michael 
Rotondi. It's the raison d'etre behind the three types of booths at Maple Drive 
(typical ones in the cocktail bar, semi-private ones, and one booth for eight, 
like a complete little room), and for the six-person slide-in-from-both-sides 
booths at the new Broadway Deli. Booths offer a way to hold court with a bit of 
elbow room, have a private party with ready-made energy, talk to a spouse you 
haven't seen all week while "going out," or do that public restaurant display: 
smooch. 
</P>
<P>
To rank as a community base, a restaurant need not be smart-looking or 
expensive. (The funky, vernacular spot can be wonderful -- and wonderfully 
ironic -- in the post-modern sense. Notice how many of the architects 
interviewed mention going to "joints.") Nevertheless, a number of interwoven 
elements now lead diners to expect a new restaurant's aesthetic presentation to 
be as clever as the food. 
</P>
<P>
Visual sophistication is a given in Los Angeles, as it is in other major 
American cities. But there are two elements of what I call "restaurant 
intelligence" that are peculiar to Los Angeles. They're nothing new; in fact, 
they're both stereotypes the city's been saddled with. Scrutinized more 
closely, though, they illuminate the prevalence and the pleasure of the 
architected venues. 
</P>
<P>
Take Los Angeles as Industry Town first. In addition to the carefully 
orchestrated look of many filmland folks and the interplay between moneyed 
producer-collectors, museums and the art works that hang on restaurant walls, 
there's also something dead center at the Life/Art intersection that 
anthropologist Edmund Carpenter calls "becoming what you behold." A great 
number of people in this town are paid to think about "the visuals" 18 hours a 
day. So when it's time to go out to eat, one expects an environment as craftily 
crafted as a Ralph Lauren ad, as engaging as the next great looking 
art-directed 35-millimeter scene. 
</P>
<P>
One other sense that's scarcely mentioned is where the second stereotype comes 
in. In addition to being a city high on images, Los Angeles is known as the 
Body Metropolis, where personal trainers purportedly reign. Now, you know as 
well as I do that everybody here isn't an Arnold S. or Jane F. Still, the 
general kinesthetic and haptic intelligence -- the bodily experiences of 
three-dimensional space and touch -- is particularly developed in this town. 
People who hike, jog, work out at clubs and, in short, pay an unusual degree of 
attention to their bodily sensations tend to be acutely sensitive to how a 
chair fits and how a room feels. Consider that the new restaurants are vortices 
not only of community but of heightened physical experience. 
</P>
<P>
Aesthetic and social demands create interesting problems for architects to 
solve. Invention and comfort are twin challenges. "A space should engage you, 
challenge and sometimes confront you," says Rotondi. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to pull all the functional elements apart, expose them into bits and 
pieces so they're part of the interest," adds Josh Schweitzer. As his 
ex-partner David Kellen puts it, "Some people want total comfort, but I think 
with pure comfort you miss a lot. You go somewhere to eat special food. Well, 
the space should wake you up, give you a little tweak too." 
</P>
<P>
Although architects often play a significant role in shaping the look of a 
place, it's frequently the restaurateur who sets the tone by dreaming up the 
precise combination of decor, service and food, all oriented for a certain 
clientele. Each of the architects we spoke with underscored the collaborative 
nature of the months-long design process and the importance of their client's 
creative input. 
</P>
<P>
Rotondi was explicit about this. "Angeli Caffe came out of very specific 
discussions with Evan (Kleiman) and John (Stroebel). In the same way, 72 Market 
was the result of working with Tony Bill and Julie Stone, and Kate Mantilini's 
with Marilyn Lewis. A client needs to be compelled to do a restaurant, to be 
more than a lawyer or doctor in need of a tax shelter. When we find a client 
with interesting ideas, we'll start designing restaurants again." 
</P>
<P>
While it's no longer the era of, say, La Coupole in Paris in the '20s or Max's 
Kansas City circa 1966, when artists traded work for meals, the architects have 
a simpatico feeling for the food their restaurant colleagues produce. 
Environment and cuisine play off one another in place after place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really helpful when I have a chance to taste the food before doing the 
work," says David Kellen. "I'd have to say that eating Mary Sue (Miliken) and 
Susan's (Feniger) food at City inspired me. With Fama, though I hadn't tasted 
the menu, I had eaten at Rockenwagner and had a feeling for the very personal, 
eclectic quality of the Italian food Hans (Rockenwagner) was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
"There must absolutely be an integration of cuisine and design," says Tony 
Greenberg, "but it's not like Italian food equals Chianti bottle and 
red-checked table cloth. It's often a two-way street. With Maple Drive, Leonard 
Schwartz was involved with the design from the inception and I was familiar 
with his food." 
</P>
<P>
Designing a restaurant may be compelling but it's no, well, picnic. "Each 
eating experience contains roots and layers of information," says Michele Saee. 
"I really respect the type of food being served and the importance of its 
context. Although I enjoy the food at the places I've designed, I usually don't 
want to go there for a few months after they've opened; I see all the small 
details that could have been different, and remember all the pain it took." 
</P>
<P>
Non-architect patrons may drink the atmosphere of a place through every pore, 
but they cannot imagine the sequence of decisions and irritations leading up to 
the Grand Opening. Rotondi sees restaurants differently from most "civilians." 
"Architecture," he says, "is really a physical journal of a period of time, 
documenting all the mental and emotional activity that went into making it." 
</P>
<P>
But don't discount the fun. Kellen says that the best part about doing a 
restaurant is frequenting it after the work is done. "With an office space, you 
can't hang out there just because you like it. With residential work, I can't 
simply step into a client's house on a Sunday night and say, 'I'd like to sit 
in your living room for a while.' But in the case of a restaurant, I can 
seriously use the place for a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
One more thing. Just in case you're thinking all the great-looking restaurants 
are about Creativity, Community and Good Eats, don't forget that Ayn Rand's 
stupendously self-confident hero of "The Fountainhead," Howard Roark, was not 
an accountant or a dentist but an architect. Listen to Tony Greenberg, designer 
of Maple Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Maple Drive? It's my favorite place to eat in the world. I go there not for 
the food or the service or the scene but for gratifying my ego. Any time I need 
to get puffed up, I go there for lunch. As Tony Bill told me, I'm a 'black hole 
for compliments.' "

You know how Los Angeles architects are: always designing some restaurant. When 
it comes right down to it, are they secretly happiest breaking bread in the 
places they've designed? And how important is architecture when they themselves 
go out to eat? 
</P>

Michael Rotondi 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I like a lot of restaurants that weren't done by 'anybody.' I think 
it's actually time for architects to step back and let people do their own 
places, the kind of places everyone likes to go to in Little Italy in New 
York." Designed (with partner Thom Mayne of Morphosis): Kate Mantilini's; 72 
Market Street; Angeli Caffe. Favorite Restaurants: Trattoria Angeli ; Tropical 
Ice Cream, Silver Lake ("it's a social equalizer"); "the odd Chilean place in 
Glendale"; 72 Market Street.

</P>
<P>
Michele Saee 
</P>
<P>
"It really depends what mood I'm in. Sometimes I feel a little uncomfortable, 
even a little angry or jealous, when I go to the very designed places because I 
start looking at them from a design point of view and criticizing them. 
Architectural space generally doesn't play very much part at all in where I 
like to go. I hate to get dressed up." Designed: Trattoria Angeli; Angeli Mare; 
Osteria Nonni; project architect for Morphosis on Angeli Caffe. Favorite 
Restaurants: Yuca's (taco stand on Hillhurst in Los Feliz); Border Grill; 
Matsuhisa; The Fish Grill; Canter's ("Especially after 2 a.m. -- I like deli 
food").

Elyse Grinstein 
</P>
<P>
(Grinstein/Daniels): "Environment does lend a certain weight to an occasion. 
But I think your expectations differ according to the place. Sometimes I love 
to be at a very beautiful restaurant -- and enjoy the obsequious service that 
often comes with that. I just love it at Chasen's, where they say, 'Oh, Mrs. 
Grinstein, let me cut your meat for you.' But, quite frankly, I think the most 
important thing is who you're with. You could be having a hamburger at The 
Apple Pan, which is very good, and if you're with a great group, you have a

"Environment has absolutely no impact on where I go at all! I'm mainly hunting

sterile with lots of glass blocks and neon, it would be impossible for them to 
serve me a good meal. Bad design irritates me." Designed: Fama; Tacos, Tacos; 
did some work on Rebecca's, and with former partner Josh Schweitzer as 
Schweitzer/Kellen: Rondo, Border Grill, Rockenwagner, City. Favorite 
Restaurants: Mitsuki, a pub on Western; Yuu's, "in a nasty little shopping

"Maybe it's that Groucho Marx line about not belonging to a club, but after 
work I tend to try to get away from 'architecture' and go to little teeny 
'joints' I can relax in. In fact, I think I search out places that are 
non-architectural. Otherwise, since I pick apart spaces I go into, it's like 
sensory overload." Designed: Campanile, the new Border Grill in Santa Monica; 
with former partner David Kellen as Schweitzer/Kellen: Rondo, Border Grill, 
Rockenwagner, City. Favorite Restaurants: Mitsuki, "a junky looking place with 
a corny fake grill with a light bulb in it and a dried fish over that . . . but 
it's serious good food"; Robata; Border Grill, "early in the morning when it's 
not open yet"; City, "in the mid-afternoon when there are around half a dozen 
people in the whole place." L.N. HALLIBURTON

IF ANY LOS ANGELES SITE COULD BE A RESTAURANT. . .

Steven Ehrlich: "The old restaurant in Union Station. It's a wonderful space 
and ready to go. Second, a cafe in the main atrium of the Bradbury Building, 
one of my favorite spaces in all of L.A. Also: It would be great to have a 
wonderful restaurant overlooking the Sepulveda Dam in the Valley with an old, 
sculptural long vista. You'd have to make a journey to get there and it would 
be worth it. We need more of the kind of restaurants you find in Europe, which 
are simply 'there' because there's a wonderful view." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Greenberg: "Windward Street in Venice between Pacific and Speedway. It's 
not a building, per se, but a whole block as outdoor space. I'd close off the 
street and create an outdoor plaza." 
</P>
<P>
Elyse Grinstein: "My very favorite place: Union Station. There's a great 
restaurant that was open in the '20s with an enormous copper bar. I would have 
loved to have done the Pan Pacific. It seems like that's a good way to preserve 
these old buildings. Like what was done with Campanile." 
</P>
<P>
David Kellen: "The Griffith Observatory, a very heroic form. The location is 
fantastic, it has great views. I would make sure that there were tables all 
around looking out. We'd have to punch a few holes in the walls. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rotondi: "Found spaces, the kind you can't do from scratch anymore, are 
what gets an architect excited. There's one building I like a lot on Glendale 
Boulevard, an old brick warehouse on the side of a hill. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Saee: "I would take any space. I don't really believe that specific 
spaces really exist in Los Angeles. I think they're all the same. What was 
City? And Angeli Trattoria was a carpet store. These big warehouses are the 
ugliest buildings, but you can invest your own fantasy in it." 
</P>
<P>
Josh Schweitzer: "There's an old Spanish Mediterranean courtyard, all worn in 
with those wonderful qualities you get in European courtyards in hot climates. 
It's on Wilshire between Western and Oxford. It's a little microwave place now. 
But it's just great: The space is all there. Put out some new tables and chairs 
and it's done. It would be spectacular."

CAL LUTHERAN PLANS MAJOR EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: THE UNIVERSITY BEGINS A $30-MILLION EFFORT TO ENLARGE ITS CAMPUS 
AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE CLAREMONT COLLEGES AND OTHER PREMIER PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California Lutheran University, the only four-year college in Ventura County, 
is launching a $30-million campaign to hoist the institution into the ranks of 
such private-school powerhouses as Redlands University and the Claremont 
Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
During the next 10 years, university officials want to nearly double the size 
of the campus by building a new creative-arts center, a physical education 
complex, an educational technology center and residence halls on 180 vacant 
acres north of the university in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also plan to increase enrollment by 25%, to 2,000. And they seek to 
boost minority enrollment -- now about 17% -- to about 25%. They hope that by 
offering better salaries they will attract more nationally recognized faculty 
members, offer more student scholarships and start a campus radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the point now where we want to make California Lutheran University a 
major institution in Southern California," said Karsten Lundring, an alumnus 
who is a member of the university's fund-raising committee. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and alumni of the relatively young university -- founded in 1959 -- 
will meet June 12 to outline ways of raising $30 million during the next four 
years, the first part of a massive fund-raising effort, Lundring said. 
</P>
<P>
He said most of the money is expected to come from alumni and corporate 
donations. About half of the funds will be used for new buildings and capital 
improvements. The remaining $15 million will be added to the university's 
$5-million endowment, which generates income to pay for scholarships and 
faculty salaries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Redlands has an endowment of $24 million and Pomona, a 
103-year-old institution that is one of the Claremont Colleges, has $285 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Although alumni, community officials and educators have reacted favorably to 
California Lutheran's expansion, a few traditionalists have expressed concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Some wonder how much emphasis will be placed on Lutheran enrollment," said 
Mark Zanlandingham, an alumnus and former member of the university's Board of 
Regents. "Can we still be a vital Christian institution and serve all 
cross-sections of people? We're at a critical stage and we have to make some 
hard decisions on what we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
University President Jerry H. Miller said he believes that the university can 
find a balance. Although the number of Lutheran students at the university is 
about 40% and dropping, Christian values continue to be emphasized, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the university is strengthening its reputation as a place 
where local government and business can turn for advice and assistance, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, California Lutheran business students will be working at the World 
Trade Center in Oxnard. And educators will be meeting with officials at the new 
Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley to coordinate history and government 
programs. School officials are considering starting a presidential studies 
program using the library's resources, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The university also is trying to improve the quality of matriculating students. 
Students wanting to attend the university this fall will have to have taken 
more college preparatory classes, such as two years of a foreign language and 
four years of English. Last year the grade point average of the typical 
entering freshman was 3.1. Officials hope to raise that to 3.25. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 80% of the students come from California, and about 22% 
percent of those students are from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, it will cost $9,450, an increase of about $900 annually, to attend 
the school. (By comparison, it will cost nearly $13,000 to attend Redlands 
University.) 
</P>
<P>
Educators outside the community say they have been carefully watching the 
changes at California Lutheran. One California State University administrator 
said it is difficult to accomplish the goals California Lutheran has set. 
</P>
<P>
"Any institution can achieve greatness if that's its goal and it has the 
wherewithal to do it," said David Leveille, the director of institutional 
relations for the Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
But Leveille added: "You need a broad base of support from your alumni and you 
have to attract the best faculty." And most important, small universities must 
be able to draw outstanding students away from the larger institutions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at California Lutheran believe the university can offer students 
something that larger state schools cannot: more personal attention. The 
average class size at California Lutheran is about 20, compared to 40 at Cal 
State Northridge. Some classes at Cal State Northridge have more than 100 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an institution where relationships are important," said Chris Munoz, 
California Lutheran's vice president for enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
But the small-university environment has drawbacks, said student Heather 
McClure, a sociology major from Utah. Sometimes classes fill up quickly, and 
the curriculum is limited, McClure said. For example there are no engineering 
or architecture classes at California Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I came to this university is because it is small," McClure 
said. "But sometimes it feels too small." 
</P>
<P>
University officials say they are looking at ways of enlarging the curriculum 
and adding more classes as part of the expansion, but admit they cannot offer 
the variety that larger institutions can. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the downside," Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said: "Cal Lutheran aspires to achieve a level of prominence . 
. . and quality" as a liberal arts institution. 
</P>
<P>
California Lutheran was incorporated in the late 1950s by the Norwegian 
immigrants who farmed the area. At first, few outside the church knew about the 
institution, which was called California Lutheran College until graduate 
programs were added in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the institution gained a reputation as a good liberal arts university. 
The graduate schools of business and education also became popular with many 
Ventura County professionals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked the university as one of the best 
small comprehensive colleges in the country. The magazine ranked California 
Lutheran 18th out of 167 American institutions with 1,500 to 2,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a theologian, attributed the rating to the quality of the university's 
instructors, a low faculty-to-student ratio (1 to 15) and a "flagship" program 
that promotes writing and verbal communication skills. 
</P>
<P>
Through a $13-million fund-raising campaign in the 1980s, the university built 
a new library and science center and started work on a new chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping that a successful sports program would play an important part in fund 
raising, officials also switched the university's athletic division so it could 
play ball with the prestigious Los Angeles-area private schools, something that 
caused considerable controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The change came after several losing seasons in National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. Division II, which includes Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Santa Clara 
University. California Lutheran officials decided that the university was 
outranked by the larger schools. As a result, officials suggested switching the 
university into Division III, which includes Redlands University and the 
Claremont Colleges, about a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most California Lutheran head coaches opposed the move. They said they did not 
want to lose athletic scholarships, which are prohibited by Division III rules. 
</P>
<P>
But university officials went ahead with the move and gave up the scholarships. 
As a result, football coach Bob Shoup stepped down after last season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the university's expansion, behavior that might be acceptable at larger 
institutions is still frowned upon. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who would like to see this college exactly as it was 30 
years ago," Zanlandingham said. For example, the college administration 
recently canceled a one-hour program on safe sex after student posters 
advertised it as National Outdoor Intercourse Day, an attention-getting device 
that riled some conservative alumni and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support safe-sex awareness," Miller said. "But there are certain 
lines that are crossed at times that are inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Student body President Stacey Reuss said students support the university's 
direction. "The changes are good," Reuss said. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz added: "On one hand, it's a most exciting time for us. But on the other 
hand, it is a taxing and draining time. Change and introspection always bring a 
mixed bag of feelings and emotions."

2 STUDENTS KILLED IN COLLISION WITH FLEEING SUSPECT 
</P>

Two Valley high school students on their way home from a pep rally were killed 
Friday night after a motorist -- who was being pursued by police in a 
gang-related shooting -- sped through a red light and slammed into their car. 
</P>
<P>
A third student in the car suffered minor injuries in the 9:10 p.m. accident at 
Chatsworth Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Mission Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested was Ray Vargas Servin, 21, whose pickup slammed into a car driven by 
Uriel Fernandez, 16, of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Uriel, a junior at San Fernando High School, was taken to San Fernando 
Community Hospital, where he died from his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Aracely Hernandez, 18, of San Fernando died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
She was a senior and a cheerleader at Sylmar High School. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Melendrez, 16, of Pacoima was treated for cuts and bruises at Holy Cross 
Medical Center and released to his parents. Melendrez's family said he was 
recovering at home Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths are the latest in a series of violent gang incidents that have 
claimed the lives of innocent bystanders in the northeastern San Fernando 
Valley. Both San Fernando and Sylmar high schools have lost students to gang 
violence in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The three students were on their way home from a pep rally at Sylmar High 
School, driving south on Laurel Canyon when their car was struck by Servin's 
pickup, which was traveling through the residential neighborhood at 55 to 60 
m.p.h., said Officer Dennis Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Servin, who was being held without bail at Van Nuys Jail, was 
involved in a gang-related shooting a few blocks away minutes before the fatal 
collision. A passenger in Servin's car, Sergio Alvidrez, 28, of Canyon Country 
was injured in the crash, but was not arrested. He was treated at Holy Cross 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Servin and several other suspected gang members became involved 
in a fight outside a house on Louvre Street, a few blocks from the accident 
scene. During the fight, he allegedly pulled a handgun and fired several shots. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando police Sgt. Michael Harvey heard the shots and went to the scene. 
When he arrived, he saw Servin's pickup leaving and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
With lights flashing, Harvey chased Servin west on Chatsworth at speeds of up 
to 60 m.p.h. Servin ran a red light at Laurel Canyon, colliding with Uriel's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Amer Elzaif, a clerk at a nearby convenience store, said he heard "some huge, 
big sound." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the crash, Elzaif said Servin and Alvidrez attempted to run 
from the scene. "I saw some people escaping from the pickup," he said. "I 
called police. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The two men were taken into custody minutes later a short distance away, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Servin appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Isaacs, assistant superintendent of senior high schools for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, said psychologists will be at the teen-agers' 
schools on Monday to counsel other students. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second time in less than two weeks that San Fernando High 
School has lost a student to gang violence, said Manuel Velazquez, a Community 
Youth Gang Services Project counselor who graduated from the school. 
</P>
<P>
On May 19, 18-year-old Ricardo Olivares, who graduated from the school last 
year and was a premed student at UCLA, was shot by two suspected gang members 
who confronted him at a convenience store one block north of the site of 
Friday's crash, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two alleged gang members, Albert Muro, 24, of Mission Hills and Arthur 
Rivera, 23, of San Fernando were arrested several days later and charged last 
week with the student's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar High School also has suffered from the surge in gang violence in the 
area, Velazquez said. Last August, Sylmar High student Jimmie Torrez III was 
beaten and shot to death by alleged gang members on a San Fernando street. The 
assailants mistakenly thought Torrez had killed a member of a gang with which 
they were associated, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Torrez's assailants pleaded guilty last week to voluntary manslaughter, 
while the two others are expected to stand trial on murder charges this week in 
San Fernando Superior Court.

NORTH PARK THEATRE'S PROTECTORS BELIEVE THE SHOWS MUST GO ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1987, in one of the last shows performed at the North Park Theatre before 
the city ordered it to close its doors, for fear that it might fall down during 
an earthquake, pop singer Suzanne Vega earned a standing ovation for her hit 
song, "Luka," about a child who's abused. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, it was hard to imagine the North Park being "unsafe and unfit" 
for the 1,186 who sat inside, as city officials now say it was. 
</P>
<P>
At the corner of 29th Street and University Avenue in North Park, once the 
center of a thriving commercial area, the 61-year-old theater sits empty, 
closed off to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Its demise mirrors that of the neighborhood around it, which is trying to make 
a comeback, much like an aging athlete willing to give it one more go. 
Opportunists hope for stores and shops and chi chi delis catering to yuppies. 
But it hasn't happened yet, and cynics say it won't. 
</P>
<P>
The area still includes the Salvation Army Thrift Store and the Paras News 
Stand, which has been there since 1925, when Calvin Coolidge was president. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, it still includes the theater, which has served as host to 
Dickensian plays, silent and "talkie" movies, stand-up comics, body-building 
forums, opera, rock 'n' roll, fundamentalist faith-healing and sad ballads 
about loving but battered children. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1929, just before the stock market crash and the onset of the Great 
Depression, the North Park Theatre is too old, too musty and too tied to the 
past ever to be confused with a child. 
</P>
<P>
But its protectors, who long to see it brought up to code and reopened as a 
performing arts center in a community starved for redevelopment, say it has 
been abused. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, said Martin Gregg, head of the North Park Theatre Foundation, 
the San Diego Police Department was using the interior of the 1,186-seat 
theater as a training site for its corps of German Shepherd police dogs. And 
again last week, for what Gregg said was the "umpteenth" time, the theater was 
vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg, who loves the theater and wants to see it restored the way that some 
people crave the delicate resurrection of "fixer-upper" homes, said the 
building deserves better than going to the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in 75% better condition than the Balboa Theatre, which may cost $11 
million to restore," Gregg said. "We at the foundation think we might be able 
to bring it up to code for as little as $300,000 to $500,000. We see it as the 
centerpiece of a revitalized North Park." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the city purchased the building for $898,600 from its previous 
owner, Horizon Christian Fellowship, which had managed the theater for a 
decade, using it for fundamentalist religious services. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg and the other two members of the fledgling North Park Theatre Foundation 
hope the theater can be reborn but in an entirely different way from what the 
church had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as the permanent home for a fleet of ethnic-oriented arts 
organizations," Gregg said. "We can be the mecca for Asian, black, Latino, gay 
and senior groups. And, we can have pop music concerts and all sorts of other 
things as well." 
</P>
<P>
As head of the now-defunct California Performing Arts Center, Gregg had booked 
a panoply of arts events into the North Park -- including the Vega concert, as 
well as dozens of plays, musicals and clown shows -- and had done so under the 
auspices of its Christian owners. 
</P>
<P>
Now the theater is struggling to stay alive, to prove it belongs. Gregg and its 
backers say the North Park offers terrific freeway access, from Interstates 8 
and 805, and that a thriving, restored arts center would serve as a magnet for 
restaurants and those chi chi shops that might attract young professionals and 
the money they like to spend. 
</P>
<P>
But the city is always in the shadows, reminding the hopeful of realities. A 
1988 structural engineering report commissioned by the city manager's office 
noted that it would take $1.4 million to bring the building up to code. The 
same report cited another $2.3 million as being necessary to make the former 
vaudeville emporium "usable" as a theater. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Kodama, property agent for the city of San Diego, said the theater simply 
fails to adhere to the city's building code. For one, the roof is not 
"appropriately" anchored to the walls, making it dangerous in high winds or 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
A large crack threatens the second-floor weight-bearing beam, and part of the 
mezzanine, built without a permit, must be removed or reconstructed in 
accordance with the code. 
</P>
<P>
"The aisles, the stairwells, the restrooms -- none of these conform to 
regulations affecting the handicapped," Kodama said. "So, all will have to be 
improved or completely replaced." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drawbacks, Kodama said a financially strapped city government 
supports a private group -- such as Gregg's foundation -- managing the one-time 
showplace and indeed making it the centerpiece of a long-overdue redevelopment. 
She said that's the main reason the city -- using Community Development Block 
Grant funds -- bought the building in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the wake of a $60-million budget crisis, Kodama said the city would 
rather see the theater restored as a working arts center than to have it 
demolished and the land converted to commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
She said Gregg's foundation has the inside track for managing the site, but in 
her words, "We are open to a mixed-use type of project. Really, we're open to 
just about anything that makes sense. We just don't want it to sit there." 
</P>
<P>
The theater has lain fallow for more than two years, and Kodama said any 
structure allowed to "just sit there and fester" will soon deteriorate even 
more. At the moment, the theater is officially closed, labeled "unsafe and 
unfit," in Kodama's words, by the city that owns it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're constantly out there removing graffiti," she said. "Periodically, we 
have crews in there removing trash and litter, and, we have a problem with the 
homeless. They've broken into the back of the building once and have tried to 
break in on other occasions, and we know they're in there, because we're always 
finding cups and napkins and trash strewn about. We hope to have an alarm 
system installed soon." 
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, the theater is an unguarded edifice. Kodama explained the 
police using it as a canine training center by saying, "Whenever we have a 
vacant building like that, the police like to expose the dogs to a new target. 
Dogs that train in the same building over and over know it's not the real 
thing. The dogs are not there anymore, but at the time, we wanted to insure 
that the police had a visible posture in the area." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman John Hartley, whose district includes North Park, succeeded 
Gloria McColl, who favored the purchase -- and restoration -- of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said that initially he "felt the resources could be better used 
elsewhere, but the community fought hard for keeping the theater, so I suppose 
we should do that. It fits well in the redevelopment plans for North Park." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg and Mark Hannon, president of the North Park Business Assn., say the 
first objective is "establishing a dialogue with the city" and making the place 
"workable." Gregg believes no more than $500,000 is needed to bring the 
building to code, a figure based on architectural studies obtained privately. 
Having it reopened would, he said, greatly enhance fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Additional money could restore the place, and, he said, turn it into a 
headquarters for dozens of small theatrical and musical companies, especially 
those with an "ethnic flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg has enlisted 44 arts organizations to serve as the foundation's advisory 
board. They include the San Diego Chinese Community School of Music, the Black 
Arts Program of the UC San Diego Department of Theatre and the (East Indian) 
Raga Ranjani School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
The theatrical and art groups listed on the board include Sledgehammer Theatre, 
which is currently producing a 5-hour version of "Hamlet" but lacks a permanent 
home; Diversionary Theatre, a gay organization, and Centro Cultural de la Raza, 
whose focus is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg believes such groups are largely disenfranchised but capable of doing 
"wonderful" work. As he puts it, the city's arts scene is hardly limited to the 
Old Globe Theatre and the La Jolla Playhouse, and the city would suffer with 
the demise of smaller groups, many of which are talented but homeless. 
</P>
<P>
R.F. McCann, who heads a Pasadena architectural firm that specializes in the 
restoration of theaters, said he had been asked by the foundation to study the 
city's engineering report to see if the figures "added up." 
</P>
<P>
McCann said before a walk-through -- he has yet to tour the theater -- he could 
not render a full analysis but added that $300,000 to $500,000 to bring the 
building up to code was "entirely possible." 
</P>
<P>
"City (engineering) estimates tend to be much higher than those done by private 
consultants," he said. "It's not that the cities are wrong, it's just that the 
work can usually be done for a lot less." 
</P>
<P>
David Thompson, an architect who lives in North Park, is working with Gregg's 
foundation to try to determine the exact amount needed to reopen the theater, 
which he said the community desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson conceded the theater has a "relatively brittle structure" and "a roof 
that isn't tied into the walls" but said the thrust of the city report was "too 
negative," focusing more on what could not be done with the theater than with 
honing in on and extrapolating its possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater could be the catalyst for completely upgrading the area," Thompson 
said. "And the time is right, because so many young couples who can't afford to 
buy elsewhere in San Diego are moving in here. North Park is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater could stimulate the value of property so that something thrives in 
the area besides . . . thrift shops. While I like thrift shops, there can only 
be so many. In Hillcrest, the Guild and the Park (movie theaters) have 
contributed to revitalization -- greatly, I would say. We think the North Park 
Theatre can do the same in North Park. But we shouldn't wait too long."

SAN DIEGO BALLOT MEASURES; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR PROPOSITIONS COULD CHANGE FACE OF THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike several high-profile statewide propositions, the highly visible 
governor's race and several unusually tough local races, San Diego voters have 
been hearing relatively little about four city ballot propositions that will be 
decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the low-key campaigns, three of the ballot propositions, if 
approved, would have a dramatic effect on San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition B would amend the City Charter by increasing the number of seats 
on the City Council to 10, up from the current 8. The proposition was placed on 
the ballot as part of an agreement that settled a lawsuit brought by the 
Chicano Federation. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition C would create a one-time waiver of the four-year minimum between 
reapportionments. If approved, it would provide a one-time waiver to the City 
Charter. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition D would extend a Gann spending-limit waiver passed four years 
ago. Most observers believe the proposition, which would not raise taxes, is 
the most important ballot issue facing San Diegans because, without it, the 
city would be forced to slash spending. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition E would allow the city to use $25 million in bonds to replace 
outdated and overloaded communications systems used by the police and fire 
departments. Most opponents tend to agree that the system is needed, but they 
argue that the system should have been funded in the upcoming council budget, 
not through bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gann Limit Waiver 
</P>
<P>
In theory, voters should have relatively little reason to oppose Proposition D, 
the Gann spending limit waiver. But, if history is any indication, theory alone 
won't help win its battle. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first attempt at winning a Gann spending limit waiver squeaked by 
four years ago with just a 510-vote margin, giving the proposition 50.2% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It won very, very narrowly then, and it's by no means a shoo-in this time," 
said Alice B. McCauly, president of the League of Women Voters of San Diego. 
"It's most important, given the budget shortfall, that the city be allowed to 
spend what it's (legally) allowed to collect." 
</P>
<P>
McCauly and others have suggested that the low-key local campaign might in part 
be related to the fact that state Proposition 111 would amend the state 
constitution to make the waiver formula more responsive to growth and 
inflation. But "Prop. 111 doesn't do everything," McCauly said. "The league 
still believes you need to (pass) Prop. D." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego isn't the only California city bumping up against the Gann barrier. 
Since the hurdle went up in 1979, 213 cities, counties, school districts and 
other government agencies have sought waivers, according to statistics 
collected by the Sacramento-based California Taxpayers Assn. A strong majority 
of those waiver campaigns were successful, according to the group. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters are quick to argue that the so-called Gann Waiver would not increase 
taxes. Rather, it would adjust the Gann limit, which, since its inception in 
1979, placed a "ceiling" on the amount of tax revenue that the city can spend 
each fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the waiver would increase the city's appropriations ceiling by 
$273 million beginning July 1, 1992, up from the $592-million limit now in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The waiver is needed, proponents argue, because San Diego's revenue sources, 
including property taxes, sales taxes and hotel room taxes, are growing faster 
than the Gann limit, which is determined by a formula based upon the national 
Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
Without the waiver, the city will lose an estimated $36 million in general fund 
revenue during the fiscal year beginning July 1 and $46 million during the 
fiscal year beginning July 1, 1993, according to Jack D. Farris, a city 
economist. Estimated losses would jump to $57 million in 1994 and $70 million 
during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
That much lost revenue would dramatically harm the city's already strained 
general fund, which finances many services, including fire and police, 
recreation, the library and social services. 
</P>
<P>
No organized opposition to the Gann waiver has surfaced, mainly, proponents 
said, because the waiver will not increase taxes. For example, no one even 
bothered to write an argument against the proposition in the registrar of 
voters' sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Taxpayers Assn., which remained neutral on the Gann waiver 
vote four years ago, is supporting the proposition, even though "council did 
what we feared last time, which was take 'one-time' money and build it into 
operations," said Taxpayers Assn. Executive Director Jim Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
The Taxpayers Assn. would be more comfortable with the waiver if the council 
were to "specifically earmark (Gann-related funds) for capital projects," Ryan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
What has surprised some observers is the low-key campaign being waged to ensure 
passage of Proposition D. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the waiver have created San Diegans for the Gann Waiver, which is 
being directed by Chris Crotty, most recently a staff member of Councilwoman 
Linda Bernhardt. But the pro-waiver organization's campaign chest is woefully 
low. A fund-raising effort by developer Mike Madigan, a chairman of the Chamber 
of Commerce's local government division, has reportedly raised only $2,000 or 
$3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the waiver has won support from all members of the San Diego City 
Council, individual council members and Mayor Maureen O'Connor have remained 
"unusually silent" on the issue, according to F.P. Crowell, chairman of the 
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
That silence might be golden, according to Wayne Raffesberger, executive 
director of San Diegans Inc., because too many San Diegans might vote against 
the limit waiver rather than turn more funds over to a council that "looks 
silly . . . (because of) flipping and flopping" on recent attempts at raising 
revenue through ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
That image "might prompt an anti-council vote rather than a pro-Gann vote," 
Raffesberger said. "You could get the opposite vote than you're trying for." 
</P>
<P>
Other observers suggested that the council has remained low-key about the Gann 
waiver because the city will have other chances to win passage if it fails on 
June 5. The council could decide to place a new proposition on the November 
ballot, and, if needed, on next June's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bigger City Council 
</P>
<P>
Proposition D isn't the only low-key campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B would expand the size of the City Council to 10, up from the 
current eight which was adopted in 1965, when the total was increased from six. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicano Federation, which won a place for Proposition B on the ballet, has 
limited funds to conduct a campaign, according to its chairman Jess Haro, a 
former San Diego councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the campaign for Proposition B has been largely limited to 
mailings and media coverage of the court fight that led to Proposition B being 
placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, including City Councilman Bruce Henderson and the Chamber's Crowell, 
are focusing on the simple argument that an increased number of council members 
will raise the cost of government. "It simply isn't needed," Crowell said. "The 
Chamber is strongly opposed to an expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Estimates vary on how much it would cost to implement Proposition B. Opponents 
cite a city manager's report setting the cost at $2 million a year. But Haro 
argues that existing council staffs could be cut back to provide funds for the 
new staff members. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of opponents' arguments will be powerful, Haro acknowledged. "Any time 
people say something is going to cost more money, it catches people's 
attention. Coupled with that is the fact that the public generally holds public 
officials in low esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Haro described Proposition B as a logical step for San Diego, which recently 
went to district elections for City Council seats and is drawing up new maps 
for those districts. "It's not diluting power," Haro said. "It's giving more 
direct representation" to residents who are not well-served by the existing 
eight council members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Simple arithmetic, Haro argued, underscores the need for more council members. 
San Diego's council members now represent at least 110,000 citizens, Haro said, 
far more than the 20,000 to 60,000 citizens represented by council members in 
other cities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the exception to rule," Haro said. "Santee, Encinitas, Poway, National 
City, they all have not less representation but more representation." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B is supported by the League of Women Voters, because "the vast 
increase in population (since 1965) calls out for better representation," 
McCauly said. "The population is getting more and more diverse, and the council 
should represent that diversity." 
</P>
<P>
Raffesberger said the council increase might appeal to San Diegans who "see it 
as an anti-incumbent vote . . . it could be people saying, 'I'm going to dilute 
the power of council members,' " Raffesberger said. "They could be saying let's 
water down what the hell's going on down there" on council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communications 
</P>
<P>
Even opponents tend to agree that Proposition E, which would finance most of a 
new police and fire communications system, is sorely needed. "We don't say it 
isn't needed," Ryan said. "But we're opposed to having pet projects like (a 
proposed Housing Trust Fund) included in the budget." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan argued that the police-fire system should be part of the budget and not on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about some of the most antiquated equipment you've seen," said 
Jeff Frazier, a member of the San Diego City Fire Fighters Union's board of 
directors, who spent two years working in the existing communications center. 
"I've worked in operations, and I've been at some pretty challenging fire 
incidents, but I've never (experienced) as much stress as with the 
(communications system)." 
</P>
<P>
"The communications system was originally proposed to last through 1983, and 
then it was updated to last through 1987," said Proposition E supporter Murray 
Galinson, chairman of San Diego National Bank. "The question in my mind is just 
when it's going to be so antiquated that we'll have a life-threatening 
situation and will not be able to respond." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment 
</P>
<P>
Proposition C is perhaps the least understood of the four citywide 
propositions. It would allow for reapportionment to occur before 1993, if 1990 
census figures turn out to be faulty. The proposition calls for a one-time 
waiver to the City Charter, which calls for the next reapportionment to occur 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Taxpayers Assn., which is opposing the other city 
propositions has elected to support C because "it's not going to increase taxes 
and it's not setting anything in motion," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Haro described Proposition C as a "companion" measure to Proposition B. 
Although the two are not necessarily tied together, "if the 10-member council 
is approved, it would have an impact" on how the reapportionment occurs, Haro 
said.

TOUGH ON COPS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there is anything that can swing the pendulum from being a conservative, 
law-abiding citizen to a protesting, law-defying anarchist, it is reading about 
two killings by the San Diego police and sheriff's departments. 
</P>
<P>
In two separate incidents, two men violently met their death. 
</P>
<P>
One man's hand held a trowel, the other man's hand held a non-existent gun. 
</P>
<P>
Has society, stress and the criminal element in San Diego caused our law 
enforcement people to react with such deadly force? Even if the appalling 
answer to this question is yes, what possible rationalization is there for the 
Sheriff's Department to leave the victim's body on the pavement for five hours 
-- handcuffed? What possible rationalization is there for the San Diego 
policeman to fire eight rounds at a man waving a trowel? 
</P>
<P>
I've always respected authority, slowed down when I saw a California Highway 
Patrol car in my rear-view mirror and could be called conservative in my 
political views. I am now questioning this "rubber stamp" as I look at the 
picture of a handcuffed dead body, and ask why? 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department certainly deserves no plaudits for 
its insensitive handling of a truly unfortunate incident. At least the San 
Diego police officer showed remorse over his part in the slaying. The two 
sheriffs showed no compassion, remorse or respect for the human condition; 
unfortunately one reaps as one sows.

JIM ROACHE IS BEST CANDIDATE FOR SHERIFF'S JOB; 
</P>
<P>
EXPERIENCE, INDEPENDENCE NEEDED FOR THE MONUMENTAL TASK FACING DUFFY'S 
SUCCESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever a public agency approached a critical moment in its history, it is the 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department. After 20 years of stewardship by John 
Duffy, marked in later years by a swaggering arrogance that has permeated the 
department, Tuesday's election offers a long-delayed opportunity for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the monumental task facing Duffy's successor. He must calm public 
jitters about whether deputies resort to force too quickly or too often. He 
must reassure the region that our jam-packed jails will contain the people 
placed there -- without routine beatings of inmates. He must patch up a 
tattered relationship with the County Board of Supervisors. Most of all, he 
must persuade the citizenry that the Sheriff's Department will again become 
accountable, and responsive, to the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, his efforts will be hamstrung by the question of long-term jail 
funding, an issue that won't be resolved until the courts rule on the 
Proposition A lawsuit. He will face questions on whether a new civilian review 
board should be established and whether to exercise more discretion in the 
distribution of concealed gun permits. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, much change will be accomplished by the departure of the imperious 
Duffy, who decided not to seek reelection rather than face public scrutiny of 
his policies and behavior. None of the five candidates to succeed Duffy, 
including his protege, Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, shows anything like his 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
But someone must complete the job, under very difficult circumstances. We 
believe that Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache is the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, a 19-year employee of the Sheriff's Department, offers this unique 
combination of assets: he may be the outsider needed to clean house at the 
department, with an insider's knowledge of how the task can be accomplished. 
Roache has come up through the department's ranks, gaining experience and 
demonstrating leadership while holding several administrative posts. He has 
worked in the jails and patrolled the streets. Later, he ran the downtown jail. 
He is now in charge of the Sheriff's Lemon Grove substation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Roache is not part of the Duffy old-boy network that has run the department 
for so long. In fact, he had to sue Duffy to change a policy that would have 
prevented him from running for sheriff, after showing the courage to announce 
his intention to run for office before Duffy decided to retire. We are hopeful 
that Jim Roache will not preserve the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, who holds a law degree, also has experience as an elected policy-maker. 
As a member of the San Diego city school board, he has earned high marks for 
hard work and open-mindedness -- belying the image of a right-wing ideologue he 
brought with him upon election in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Roache also showed foresight with his early endorsement of a civilian review 
board. Our only major disagreement with him is that he does not support a 
separate Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Deputy Sheriffs Assn. has endorsed Drown, Roache would face the 
task, if elected, of winning over a force that supported his opponent. He also 
would have to build bridges to the sizable and powerful network of Duffy 
supporters throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Drown would not confront such problems. And, as a 20-year veteran of the 
department, his knowledge and experience are certainly equal to Roache's. 
</P>
<P>
But, as much as he tries to distance himself from his boss, Drown owes his 
station and many of his campaign advantages to Duffy. Certainly he has 
</P>
<P>
tapped into some of the same financial sources that Duffy has used in previous 
campaigns. Voters must ask themselves this question: even when Duffy cleans out 
his desk, how much influence would he or his allies have over department policy 
with Drown in charge? 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno also makes a strong case that he is the man 
to clean up the Sheriff's Department. As a total outsider, and one with 
demonstrated knowledge of managing police departments in Carlsbad and 
Escondido, he makes a strong case. But his qualifications are not as impressive 
as Roache's. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler has the experience and know-how 
necessary to manage a law enforcement agency the size of the Sheriff's 
Department. But Hoobler resigned under a cloud in 1975, when he came under fire 
for lying about reviewing confidential files of police counselors. Carlsbad 
police officer Jim Messenger lacks the experience for the job. 
</P>
<P>
With five candidates involved, Tuesday's primary likely will yield two 
finalists for a November runoff, not a new sheriff. But it may serve as 
something of a referendum on John Duffy's tenure and provide a preview of how 
much change San Diegans can expect in the years ahead.

BORDER LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people who wish to light up the border throw aside accusations that they 
are racists by claiming that they want only to draw attention to Mexican 
citizens who come across the border illegally and prompt Mexico's government 
and ours to stop this flow of human traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The debate as to whether or not they're really racists could go on and on, 
without perceptions from either side of the argument changing. 
</P>
<P>
The reality, however, is: Those who light up the border don't seem to realize 
that their headlights cast long, depressing shadows on the proud human beings 
who, through their hopes and dreams, seek only to better their lives and the 
lives of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how one feels about this social issue, be it an issue of racism or 
not, no one struggling to survive deserves to have her or his dream turned into 
a nightmare by beams of light shining from the vehicles of people who enjoy the 
freedom and lifestyle they desire. 
</P>
<P>
None of us has the answer, but we can't begin to solve the problems at our 
border until we dim our lights and try to understand in a spirit of compassion.

PROSTITUTION STING NETS 62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-two men were arrested in the sports arena for soliciting prostitutes 
Friday night, marking the San Diego Police Department's second largest 
overnight crackdown, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation John," deploying female police officers dressed as prostitutes, 
swept the Midway, Rosecrans and sports arena area monthly in response to many 
complaints from residents and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the community not to be bothered by this business," spokesman Bill 
Robinson said, adding that similar operations are being planned in other parts 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 62 arrested was a 15-year-old, a teacher and a Michigan man in San 
Diego for his brother's graduation from boot camp. So far 211 people have been 
arrested in the sting operations on misdemeanor charges of soliciting for 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The 62 arrests marked San Diego vice's busiest night since 63 people were 
arrested recently in a similar operation in the 3200 block of Main Street.

NAKED INTRUDER SHOT DEAD AFTER BURSTING INTO RESEDA HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A naked man who broke into four Reseda homes and terrorized residents Friday 
night was shot and killed by a homeowner whose wife he threatened, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Brian Holloway, 23, smashed his head and hands through several windows 
during the 11 p.m. rampage, police said. Holloway, who lived about a mile away 
from the neighborhood, had been unemployed for the last year after a five-year 
stint in the Army. None of the people he terrorized knew him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy will be performed to determine whether Holloway was under the 
influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers were investigating several reports of an intruder 
in the 6800 block of Lasaine Avenue when they responded to a "shots fired" call 
at a home on the street. Officers found the owner, James E. Bruner, 38, 
standing outside the home. He took them to the living room, where police found 
Holloway's body. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner told police he was home with his wife, Elizabeth, 38, and their 
17-year-old daughter when he heard a noise in the back yard. He went to 
investigate and was confronted by a naked man covered with blood. The two men 
fought briefly before Bruner broke away and ran back into his house, locking a 
sliding glass door behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner "directed his family to call police while he armed himself" with a 
shotgun, Officer Tom Zwinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway then threw himself through the glass door and "charged" Elizabeth 
Bruner, Zwinger said. Bruner fired twice at Holloway, killing him, Zwinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner, who suffered cuts and bruises during his fight with Holloway, was 
questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Bruner house was Holloway's last stop on a rampage through the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Residents at one house told police that an intruder shoved his head through a 
closed bathroom window and began yelling. At a second house, a man smashed his 
hand through a window in a front door, unlocked the door and confronted a woman 
before throwing himself through a front window. 
</P>
<P>
A bedroom window at a third house was smashed, but Holloway did not enter. He 
instead went to the back yard and took off his clothes before going to the 
Bruner house.

SPEAKERS THREATEN BOYCOTTS, LAWSUITS TO KEEP LOCKHEED 
</P>

<P>
Nearly 2,000 Lockheed Corp. workers rallied at a Burbank union hall Saturday to 
kick off a campaign aimed at persuading officials of the aerospace company not 
to leave Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A steady parade of union leaders and politicians -- including Mayor Tom Bradley 
and state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) -- urged Lockheed employees to 
stick together and threatened the company with boycotts and lawsuits if it 
follows through on plans to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any longer," Roberti said. 
"If Lockheed leaves we're going to make sure it's the bitter end of that 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's rally marked the beginning of a community campaign to prevent 
Lockheed from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a labor movement. This is a community movement as well," said 
Charlie Brown, president of Aeronautical District Lodge 727 of the 
International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union that 
represents many Lockheed employees. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley told the workers he would "be in this fight until the bitter, 
bitter end." 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace company announced on May 8 that it was pulling much of its 
operation out of Burbank and selling nearly all of its 320 acres there. 
Lockheed also announced that two major aircraft it had been proposing to build 
at its Palmdale facility -- the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the P-7A -- will 
instead be built at its plant in Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 4,500 workers are expected to lose their jobs in the cost-cutting 
reorganization. Lockheed officials have not said what will happen to those 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Lockheed may think they'll make a profit by moving to Georgia, but someday 
that's going to come back and bite them -- and you know where," said Pete 
Beltran of United Auto Workers Local 645. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, many of whom wore red to symbolize their anger at Lockheed, roared 
with approval. It was not an event at which Lockheed officials were entirely 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Several crowd members wore T-shirts emblazoned with a skunk and the slogan 
"Lockheed Stinks," in a reference to the company's super-secret Advanced 
Development Co., nicknamed the "Skunk Works." 
</P>
<P>
Monico Zamora, 31, a Lockheed maintenance supervisor, said his job is uncertain 
from month to month. He remained optimistic, however, that workers could 
convince the company not to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
"We can still save something here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Mann, international representative for the United Auto Workers urged the 
audience to fight for one goal. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a right to your job," he said. "I don't want to hear for a year. I 
don't want to hear retraining. I don't want to hear severance. I want to hear 
Lockheed must stay. . . . You should have only one demand: Stay in L.A."

NAVAL AIR STATION COMMANDER NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new commanding officer has been appointed to run Point Mugu Naval Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Paul J. Valovich assumed command of the station last week. 
</P>
<P>
He had been vice commander and deputy laboratory director of the Naval Weapons 
Center at China Lake since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In his new position, Valovich is responsible for a huge spectrum of station 
activities, said Lt. Commander Gene Okamoto. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a small city here, and he's sort of like the city manager or the 
mayor," Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Valovich is responsible for the public works, housing, supply, security, 
recreation and administration departments, as well for aircraft maintenance and 
the chapel on base. 
</P>
<P>
Valovich, a native of Charleroi, Pa., graduated in 1965 from Purdue 
University's Naval ROTC program with a degree in mechanical engineering. In 
1973, he received a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the Naval 
Postgraduate School in Monterey. Valovich is also a graduate of the Navy 
Fighter Weapons School, and flew more than 200 combat missions in Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Valovich has no authority over the Pacific Missile Test Center, which is run by 
Rear Adm. George H. Strohshal, and located at the Point Mugu Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
"PMTC is like a renter on the base," Okamoto said, terming the arrangement 
between PMTC and the Naval Air Station "tenant command." KIM KASH

236 VEHICLES IMPOUNDED IN POLICE SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police and Department of Transportation officers on Saturday 
impounded 236 vehicles in an eight-hour sweep aimed at cutting the high number 
of hit-and-run accidents in the San Fernando Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers impounded cars whose drivers had suspended or revoked licenses or 
whose vehicle registrations expired more than one year ago, Sgt. Dennis Zine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Such drivers account for the majority of hit-and-run crashes because they flee 
accidents to avoid penalties for illegally operating their vehicles, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
Zine said of the 236 impounded vehicles, 189 were being driven by uninsured 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 287 citations were issued, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zine said 38 police officers and 12 transportation department officers 
participated in Saturday's operation, which he called the most successful of 
its kind in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It targeted the Van Nuys, North Hollywood and northeast Valley areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 101 vehicles were impounded in a similar operation conducted by 11 
police officers, Zine said.

<P>
Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and 
were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe that there will be a "peace dividend" as a result of reduced 
tension with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, would you generally be most inclined to use the dividend to: a) spend 
more on domestic needs, b) reduce the deficit, c) cut taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes. First domestic needs, then deficit and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. All of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of dealers and users will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory (R): No. Use of military, death penalty for traffickers, education on 
the user/demand side. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. Need a national sense of purpose that says we will not become a 
drug-addicted nation. Use positive messages about health. Prosecution should 
include mandate for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. All of the judicial system should be stopped from being 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the federal government is supposed to cut the 
budget deficit to zero by 1993. Is that a realistic goal? 
</P>
<P>
Briefly explain your answer. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): Yes. If we hold the line on no new taxes and the voters demand 
spending cuts by holding Congress accountable on election day for the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. Current election trends show same representatives who have not 
controlled excessive spending will return to office. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. They cannot cut the budget deficit until they stop sending 
money all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more 
difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land 
prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers 
to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property 
prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties refuse such so-called "upzoning"? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. Federal government should not be allowed to artificially 
interfere with land prices in a free market, or to intrude in local government 
policy or private property rights. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes. Unless county officials practice some self-control by adhering 
to zoning guidelines, prime recreation and natural areas will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes, when applied fairly so that poor minorities are not the only 
ones to suffer the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes, but women should be discouraged from deciding on abortion 
because baby is not the desired sex. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support President Bush's policy of seeking to maintain good relations 
with China's current regime despite its violent suppression of the 
pro-democracy movement last year? 
</P>
<P>
If no, what specific measures should the United States take against China? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. Cut diplomatic relations, invoke economic sanctions, grant 
asylum to Chinese national students and dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. Stronger protest and cutbacks in trade. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. Just do not send money to them. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor opening up additional parts of the California coastline to oil 
exploration under any circumstances other than a national emergency? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support a national gasoline tax increase if the proceeds were 
dedicated to improving transportation? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. Use money already allocated. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the amount of money a candidate for national office 
can spend on the campaign? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you support at least a partial taxpayer-financed campaign funding as 
part of a reform package that limited spending? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the number of terms that U.S. senators and 
representatives can serve? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, what should the limit be? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): Yes. Senate, two 6-year terms. House, three 4-year or six 2-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. Two terms Senate, three terms Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor more control over the availability of handguns to the general 
public? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, what specific controls? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): No. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes. "Brady Bill" waiting period, background screening. Keep guns 
away from children and out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the current program to build a "Star Wars" anti-missile 
system? 
</P>
<P>
If yes, do you think the program is adequately funded? 
</P>
<P>
Gregory (R): Yes. I don't have enough information to honestly know. Much of it 
is classified. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (D): Yes. Yes, funding should allow research to maintain parity with 
Soviet research. I do not see the need to fund production, deployment. 
</P>
<P>
M. Thomas (D): Yes. No. it is not adequately funded.

20TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
'CONSERVATIVE' THOMAS CHALLENGED BY CANDIDATE FROM FARTHER RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At one point during last winter's Republican state convention, a group of 
well-dressed members of the ultraconservative Young Americans for Freedom booed 
loudly as a middle-aged congressman from Bakersfield spoke from the convention 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman, William M. Thomas, was explaining details of a bill he helped 
write to make it easier for citizens to register to vote. But the bill has 
raised the hackles of some Republicans, particularly those on the right, who 
fear it may damage recent GOP registration gains. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' convention speech wasn't the first time he has offended the right. 
Though considered generally conservative, Thomas supports abortion rights, an 
issue that has become a litmus test for many conservative activists. 
</P>
<P>
Now Thomas, running for his seventh term in the sprawling, four-county 20th 
Congressional District, faces a challenger from the right in Tuesday's GOP 
primary election -- a Santa Clarita abortion foe and former Los Angeles 
sheriff's deputy, Rod Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
It is only the second primary opponent Thomas, 48, has run against since his 
1978 election in the sprawling district, which corkscrews across 22,000 square 
miles of California's abdomen, from the ranching country of San Luis Obispo 
County to the desert wastes of Inyo County. It also covers a portion of the 
Antelope Valley in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But the district's political center of gravity is Kern County, where Thomas -- 
who launched his political career from the obscurity of a job teaching American 
government at a Bakersfield community college -- is well-entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers give Gregory, 33, little chance of upsetting Thomas, 
considered one of the GOP's wiliest tacticians. Gregory, who owns a firm that 
services swimming pools, is making his first run for public office and has 
raised about $15,000 for the race. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP nominee will face the winner of the Democratic primary in the November 
general election. But the Republican nominee is likely to prevail in the 
district, where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by 49% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats on the primary ballot are Lita Reid, a free-lance journalist from 
Ridgecrest, and Michael A. Thomas, a Grover City businessman. In the 1988 
general election, William Thomas trounced Reid by 71% to 27%. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting political fallout in the race so far is the refusal of two 
influential Kern County-area Republicans, Assemblyman Phil Wyman and state Sen. 
Don Rogers, to endorse Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas criticized the two lawmakers -- both of them staunch conservatives he 
has tangled with -- for not backing him in the interest of party unity, angrily 
charging that Wyman "wimped out" when Thomas asked for his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman charged that Gregory is an extremist who is staging a 
"one-issue contest" centered on abortion. Gregory, who has been arrested twice 
while protesting outside abortion clinics, helped found a Newhall counseling 
center that urges pregnant woman not to have abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to take government and use it to enforce his opinions on others," 
Thomas said. "Ironically, I don't find that very conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory rejected the notion that he is an extremist, saying Thomas is out of 
step with the district on the abortion-rights issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The pro-family vote out there is very dissatisfied, and they're ready to 
change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory attacked Thomas for co-sponsoring the national voter-registration bill 
with Rep. Al Swift (D-Washington). Under one provision, citizens could 
re-register when they renewed their driver's license, prompting wags to dub it 
the "motor voter" bill. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory charged that the bill, which has passed the House of Representatives, 
would encourage voter fraud. He said it would also result in three times as 
many Democrats being signed up as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas said polls show that a majority of unregistered voters "have 
Republican tendencies," and making it easier to register will actually add to 
GOP membership. 
</P>
<P>
Few political observers believe Gregory represents any real threat to Thomas, 
who has carefully built up his political muscle in the district by actively 
supporting local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a chance" of Thomas losing, said Los Angeles-based political 
consultant Tim Carey, a one-time Thomas field representative. "Thomas is a big 
machine up there." 
</P>
<P>
A professional political scientist, Thomas is the California GOP congressional 
delegation's leading strategist on redistricting and was recently described by 
a national political journal as "an aggressive political maneuverer." 
</P>
<P>
In his first term, he managed to land a seat on the House Agriculture 
Committee, a plum assignment for a lawmaker from farm-rich Kern County. He has 
since won a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.

OFFICERS RECALL THE MOMENTS THEY FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In dozens upon dozens of reports on file at the San Diego County district 
attorney's office, local law enforcement officers describe in interviews with 
investigators the second-by-second thoughts that blazed through their minds as 
they unholstered their firearms, raised their guns and shot a variety of people 
in what they perceived as life-threatening situations. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they were confronted by people pointing guns. Sometimes by those 
brandishing knives or throwing rocks. Sometimes by suspects roaring toward them 
in cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the car was going to run me over," said George C. Kathan, a San Diego 
police officer who in February shot Jerry Dean Dromely in the right temple, 
causing him major brain damage. "I thought the guy was going to run me over. He 
knew who I was. He saw me standing there." 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Police Officer James LeStage killed Timothy L. Bloodworth with four 
rounds from his 9-millimeter semiautomatic firearm, hitting him in the throat 
and left arm. The shooting occurred last July, when LeStage was bumped by 
Bloodworth's fleeing car. LeStage thought the driver was grabbing for a weapon 
in his lap, when actually he was only holding his genitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not sure who (he) was, what he was doing in the area, if there were 
other occupants in the vehicle or if he was armed," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
But, LeStage added, "Drawing my side arm is something I do when I perceive a 
threat to myself or anyone else, more of an instinct rather than a conscious 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Also in July, San Diego Police Officer Daniel Roman shot and killed Lawrence 
Miller in his Mira Mesa apartment, hitting him twice in the abdomen when the 
man with a knife and a meat cleaver continued to come at him and his partner 
down a flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry," Roman told authorities. "He came toward me. He wanted to get one 
of us. He had it in his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County sheriff's Deputy Danny McGowan fatally shot Robert Dean 
Thompson in November. He shot him in the chest in a house in Vista, where he 
had barricaded himself from police, raised a gun and threatened to "shoot it 
out" with the cops. Later, authorities found a letter Thompson left for his 
widow, proclaiming: "I live by the sword and I will die by that same sword." 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that flashed through my mind is he's going to shoot me," 
McGowan said. "I remember seeing those training tapes and how easy it is for 
someone to just take that gun . . . and boom, shoot you before you can react, 
and that was going through my head." 
</P>
<P>
Some officers expressed fear. 
</P>
<P>
"It was dark and I was, I was scared," said sheriff's Deputy Edward C. Jackson, 
describing how he wounded an unarmed Sergio Castillo after a chase in North 
County in November, 1988. "I only, I reacted real fast and I started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Other officers couldn't remember exactly why they fired. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Officer Alan Alvarez wounded Michael Harris in a January, 
1988, stolen-truck incident. "I don't remember actually shooting him," Alvarez 
said. "I just did it. I didn't think about it. It just happened." 
</P>
<P>
Many officers came away emotionally distraught. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Sgt. Larry Wood wounded parolee Randall Geiger when the officer's gun 
discharged in a struggle in January, 1988. It was "like a dream almost to me," 
he later told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Saunders, a witness, said "the cop's hand was shaking." Lisa Saunders, 
another witness, also remembered his reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"He just stuttered," she said. "He was saying, like, 'I didn't mean to,' or 'I 
didn't want to.' I was crying and hysterical, and I looked up and the officer 
was also crying."

A FILMMAKER'S FINANCES FACE A COURT ASSAULT; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA REMAINS A MAGNIFICENT BANKRUPT. BUT HIS 
LATEST CHAPTER 11 FILINGS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED BY A MAJOR CREDITOR. AT STAKE 
ARE HIS FILM AND VINEYARD BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing is simple with Francis Ford Coppola, least of all his bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
In the filmmaker's latest pair of Chapter 11 proceedings -- and there have been 
four since 1983 -- the biggest creditor is longtime Coppola associate Fred 
Roos. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, a good soldier, has co-produced at least 16 of Coppola's films, from "The 
Conversation" to "Tucker." He also served as an officer of Coppola's Zoetrope 
Corp. until after the most recent bankruptcy petitions were filed last January 
and since has been in New York with the director, helping to finish "The 
Godfather, Part III" for Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents on file with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Rosa, 
Coppola or his businesses nevertheless may owe Roos the staggering sum of $53 
million, including interest, because two Roos-owned companies hold a 
$32-million promissory note from Coppola that they purchased at a steep 
discount from Chase Manhattan Bank in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But if Roos has a gun to Coppola's head, it is only because the movie director 
handed it to him: Roos purchased the note with the proceeds of a $5.25-million 
Chemical Bank loan that was guaranteed by Coppola and his wife, Eleanor. 
</P>
<P>
That peculiar debt between friends -- created with backing from Coppola himself 
-- has become the focal point in a bizarre legal dispute that is threatening to 
destroy the director's blossoming film and vineyard businesses and, according 
to Coppola's own court filings, may even jeopardize his ability to deliver the 
long-awaited Mafia epic in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, his debt repayment plans might also turn Coppola into a hired 
gun again, working more for the sake of commerce than art. He claims to have 
done exactly that in the 1980s, when he paid down earlier debts by making 
"Tucker," "Peggy Sue Got Married" and "Gardens of Stone" for Paramount and 
Tri-Star. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Shield 
</P>
<P>
Coppola adversaries have styled the Roos debt a "sham." 
</P>
<P>
They claim that the director devised it as a tax shelter and has relied on its 
fast-accruing but largely unpaid interest obligation to avoid paying any income 
tax on more than $13 million in movie income in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
They further say Coppola, fat with assets, is using the Roos debt to shield his 
large Napa County estate and other properties from a potentially crippling 
$8-million court judgment won earlier this year by the Singer family of Canada, 
who have been dogging him for nearly a decade to repay a $3-million loan that 
helped finance the disastrous "One From the Heart." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not personal. We've never been angry. We'd like to have settled this a 
long time ago," Alan Singer, 43-year-old son of Calgary real estate magnate 
Jack Singer, said of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Because creditors vote on key issues in bankruptcy proceedings according to the 
amount of debt they hold, Roos, apparently Coppola's largest creditor, can 
outvote the Singers when it comes to decisions about the filmmaker's financial 
future. Were it not for the Roos debt, moreover, Coppola's assets would far 
exceed his liabilities, and the Bankruptcy Court might simply order him to sell 
some property to satisfy the Singers and other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola and Roos declined through representatives to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the two contend that the Roos promissory note, created as 
part of an overall settlement of Coppola's massive debt to Chase Manhattan in 
the early 1980s, is genuine -- although Roos never pressed to collect on it 
before the recent bankruptcies, and Coppola's attorneys say they plan to 
dispute how much of the obligation remains valid. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's attorneys add that the Singers are trying to get favored position 
over legitimate but more sympathetic creditors, such as Roos. "Putting aside 
the law for a moment, I think you have to ask yourself what's fair here," said 
Coppola lawyer Michael Ahrens. 
</P>
<P>
In plans filed with the Bankruptcy Court by Coppola and his Zoetrope 
Productions, the filmmaker proposes to pay his debts over seven years by 
contributing half his income from a projected six films, among other things. 
The plans rely on his 15% share of Paramount's receipts from "Godfather III," 
even though future income is protected from current creditors under bankruptcy 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"Francis is willing to use his future earning power so that he can have a plan 
of reorganization with his creditors confirmed," Ahrens explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plea for Peace 
</P>
<P>
Distraught by his financial woes, Coppola recently bypassed his attorneys to 
approach the Singers with a personal plea for peace, according to individuals 
familiar with the foray. No settlement has been reached so far, and attorney 
Robert Chapman, who represents the Singers, said his clients are reluctant to 
endorse the bankruptcy plans, which they believe will pay them well under 30 
cents on the dollar for their debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Singers have asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to extend their 
$8-million award -- which Coppola is appealing -- to include not just the 
filmmaker personally but also Zoetrope Corp., his principal holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Such an extension could lead the holding company to join the Coppola family and 
Zoetrope Productions in Bankruptcy Court, as Coppola's representatives fight to 
block what they say are looming sheriff's sales of his winery or his office 
building in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
If Coppola hadn't filed for bankruptcy protection, the Singers could ask the 
court for "writs of execution" entitling them, within days, to seize Coppola's 
bank accounts, impound payments due him from movie studios, or have sheriffs in 
Napa or San Francisco counties sell his property. 
</P>
<P>
"If a judgment lien is entered and execution imposed upon Mr. Coppola," the 
director's attorneys have also said in court papers, "his ability to complete 
'Godfather III' will be seriously jeopardized." 
</P>
<P>
For Coppola, the 1990s weren't supposed to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Singers won their judgment, the 51-year-old filmmaker seemed close to 
a period of comfort and creative freedom, far removed from the money worries 
that plagued him since he founded his film company in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's winery business, the Niebaum-Coppola Estate, is coming into its own. 
Its Cabernet-Merlot blend, called Rubicon, is respected, partly because Coppola 
has insisted on holding each vintage seven years before release. 
</P>
<P>
"You're definitely dealing with a super-premium wine. . . . They're doing 
something most wineries can't afford to do," said Bill Faherty of Western Wine 
Services, which works with Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
Niebaum-Coppola produces 6,000 cases of wine a year and has inventory worth $6 
million, according to Coppola's filings with the Bankruptcy Court. Winery 
profit, including income from grape sales to neighboring Inglenook, is 
projected at about $200,000 in 1991, but that is expected to rise fivefold by 
the end of the decade as warehoused vintages are released. 
</P>
<P>
The estate, which includes 1,700 acres on the western slope of the Napa Valley, 
appears to be Coppola's most valuable asset. He bought it in 1975 for a 
reported $2 million and watched it appreciate to roughly $10 million, according 
to his bankruptcy filings -- subject to $2.5-million security interest held by 
Chase and the Roos debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valuable Properties 
</P>
<P>
A 22-room Victorian house on the property once was a summer home for Inglenook 
founder Gustav Niebaum and now serves as Coppola's residence and workshop. 
</P>
<P>
The director once dreamed of building a larger studio in Napa. In 1982, he 
hired the Mexican architectural firm Barragan y Ferrera to design the facility, 
which he hoped would become the model for an even grander "communications city 
of the future" in Belize, where Coppola owns a lodge. As design fees rose, 
however, Coppola dropped the project, and he has since contested Barragan y 
Ferrera's fees in Napa Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Coppola has enjoyed the use of another major asset, his co-op 
apartment at the Sherry Netherland. The luxury hotel was a setting for the 
Coppola-directed vignette in Disney's "New York Stories" last year. Coppola's 
apartment there is carried in the director's bankruptcy schedules at $2.5 
million and was recently offered for sale at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Zoetrope headquarters at 916 Kearny St. in San Francisco was appraised this 
year at $1.9 million. The building houses much of Coppola's electronic 
equipment, worth millions more, but its most precious appointment appears to be 
its ship's cabin-like penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's associates say the director has often plotted his films in the 
wood-inlaid cabin, which is lined with video equipment and graced by a sky-lit 
mural that mingles scenes from his movies with important people in his life. 
The mural depicts Gian-Carlo Coppola, the 23-year-old son who was killed in a 
boating accident four years ago, standing not far from 56-year-old Roos. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola has denigrated the work he produced in his hideaway during the past 
decade. "I just don't want to be doing this anymore," he said after shooting 
"Tucker," according to a story in Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
(Coppola told the same reporter he "fired" Fred Roos from the set of "Godfather 
III" in Rome after some production snafus. Representatives of both filmmakers 
say there was no serious rift, and Roos later returned to the production in New 
York.) 
</P>
<P>
But the films, for which he was paid 10% of gross receipts with a guarantee of 
$2.5 million, nearly repurchased his creative freedom before the Singers 
prevailed in court. According to the bankruptcy files, Coppola has worked off 
all but $2.5 million of his only significant bank debt, what remains of a 
$7.75-million note held by Chase Manhattan. Chase in 1983 had accepted the note 
-- along with the separate payment from Roos and some movie rights -- in 
settling a $30-million-plus debt he had owed to the bank, thanks to "One From 
the Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's failed musical, which died in theaters eight years ago, has haunted 
him since. 
</P>
<P>
"One From the Heart" cost more than $25 million to produce but took in less 
than $2 million when Columbia Pictures released it domestically in 1982 and 
just over $8 million from all markets, including cable and videocassette sales. 
It was touted as a cinematic experiment, its lush Las Vegas scenes having been 
shot in miniature at the director's own Zoetrope Studios in Los Angeles. 
Ultimately, it tested the ingenuity of the lawyers who are still bickering over 
its liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
As Coppola's representatives have said in court documents, the filmmaker had 
spent most of his initial funding from Chase Manhattan by the time he started 
shooting in February of 1981. Jack Singer, on learning of Coppola's bind, 
offered an $8-million loan to finish the film, but only if he could recover his 
investment on an equal footing with Chase. Singer advanced $3 million before 
the deal fell apart, and Chase eventually provided funds to complete the movie, 
after Coppola guaranteed the loan with his personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1983, the Singers forced Coppola's studio operation into bankruptcy 
and then bought the property for $12.3 million at a foreclosure sale, after 
earlier discouraging a higher offer for the property by threatening legal 
action that might have blocked the bid. They renamed it Hollywood Center 
Studios and operate it as a rental facility for movie and TV show makers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits 
</P>
<P>
When the bankruptcy was concluded in 1985 because the studio subsidiary had no 
assets left after paying off a mortgage with proceeds from the sale, the 
Singers sued Coppola for their $3 million. Coppola countersued, claiming that 
Singer never meant to finance his film and was only trying to get a lien on the 
studio. In separate state and federal suits filed later in Los Angeles, Coppola 
also claimed that the Singers captured his studio with proceeds of a supposed 
fraud against two Texas thrifts, in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
The latter suits were dismissed, and the Singers won a summary judgment -- an 
award directly from the court, without a jury trial -- in their own suit. When 
it became apparent last summer that the Singers were likely to prevail in an 
initial judgment against Coppola's now dormant studio holding company, 
officially called Hollywood General Studios, that unit declared bankruptcy in 
San Francisco, but the filing was quickly dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid foreclosure sales while appealing the various court decisions, 
Zoetrope President John Peters tried to borrow $11 million from Bank of America 
to post a bond. But the bank last January declined to lend more than $7.3 
million. The Coppola family and Zoetrope Productions filed bankruptcy petitions 
the next day, allowing them to pursue their appeals without posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
If they have held off a sheriff's sale, the bankruptcies have also made a 
display of the director's finances. Documents filed with the court describe 
everything from his unpaid pharmacy bills to the $150,000 value of his Tucker 
automobiles and the $10,000 he lost last year at the Peppermill Casino in Reno, 
where he worked on the script to "Godfather III." 
</P>
<P>
The documents also show that the filmmaker could pay the Singer judgment, if 
painfully, were it not for his rapidly accumulating debt to his friend, Fred 
Roos. 
</P>
<P>
According to a balance sheet that Peters delivered to Bank of America officers 
when seeking the loan last year and that he later supplied to the court, 
Coppola had a net worth of $25,050,000. That calculation didn't include any 
value for Coppola's 100% ownership of Zoetrope Corp., nor did it include the 
$50-million-plus Roos debt, which Peters later said he had omitted out of 
"haste." 
</P>
<P>
In more carefully drawn schedules submitted to the court, Coppola claimed 
assets of $23 million, consisting largely of wine and real estate. Those 
schedules showed him to have a negative net worth of $24 million -- largely 
because this time they included a substantial portion of the Roos debt. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, it is Roos who keeps Coppola insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the Roos note is held by Hot Weather Films and Pony Boy Inc., two 
corporations owned by FR Productions, Roos' personal holding company. Zoetrope 
President Peters was secretary and chief financial officer of both Hot Weather 
and Pony Boy, which respectively produced "Rumble Fish" and "The Outsiders" for 
Coppola, but he resigned after the bankruptcies were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Zohn, an attorney for Roos, said the companies purchased their 
$32-million Coppola note from Chase as an investment. During the past seven 
years, the note -- which was to be repaid with proceeds from various films -- 
has accumulated $25.1 million in accrued interest, according to documents filed 
by Coppola. During that period, Roos' companies have received payments totaling 
only a fraction of that amount -- "at least $5 million," according to Zohn -- 
which were used to retire the Chemical Bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Creditors have different ways of approaching things. I've been involved with a 
number of creditors who don't believe they have to squeeze blood out of a 
turnip to collect," Zohn explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Question 
</P>
<P>
In adversary pleadings before the Bankruptcy Court, Singer attorney Chapman has 
offered another explanation for the debt. In his view, Coppola and Roos used 
the note to keep Coppola's "One From the Heart" debt alive, at least on paper, 
after Coppola was advised that he might face a huge tax liability if Chase 
forgave his debt in return for partial payment. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Chapman has argued, the note allowed Coppola "to accrue enormous 
interest on the 'debt' to show huge net operating losses to write off against 
large amounts of income that would be generated by Mr. Coppola in the future." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, neither Coppola nor Zoetrope Corp. has filed state or federal income 
tax returns for 1987, 1988 or 1989, according to his representatives. In a 
deposition, Peters said he expected to file the tax returns soon but believed 
that Coppola would owe no taxes for the three years. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ahrens, Coppola's attorney, declined to comment on the filmmaker's 
taxes. Barry Hirsch of Armstrong &amp; Hirsch, a Los Angeles firm that handles 
business affairs for Coppola and Roos, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Singers' view, the Roos debt further operates to deprive them of their 
due. As Chapman has argued, Coppola "wishes, for reprehensible purposes, to use 
a bogus debt to show that he is insolvent and prepare a plan which will force 
(the Singers) to accept less than what they are owed." 
</P>
<P>
Ahrens has disavowed that claim in court, contending that the bankruptcy 
proceedings will ultimately confirm the validity of the debt. "(They) use words 
like 'sham.' . . . But this man got himself a movie studio for virtually 
nothing," he added of Singer. 
</P>
<P>
Under Coppola's bankruptcy plans, in any case, Roos would release all his 
security interest in Coppola's personal properties for a new $10-million note 
secured by Zoetrope Corp. He would also share with the Singers and others in a 
note settling unsecured claims for $12 million, payable over seven years -- an 
arrangement that would apparently provide partial payment to both creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Whether any such plan is ultimately approved by creditors and the Bankruptcy 
Court, Coppola is likely to face intense grilling now that he has finished 
filming "Godfather III." 
</P>
<P>
On June 11, he is scheduled to undergo a "Section 2004 examination," a kind of 
deposition, by his creditors -- and the Los Angeles court is considering 
whether his Zoetrope Corp., parent to the unit that is producing "Godfather 
III," will be vulnerable to the Singers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman has said he will continue to attack the existing Chapter 11 cases as 
invalid -- a position the court disallowed in a preliminary skirmish, even 
while demanding more financial disclosure from Coppola and leaving the door 
open to new dismissal motions. 
</P>
<P>
William Jennings, who represents Coppola against the Singers, meanwhile said he 
has appealed two of the Los Angeles cases and plans to appeal the third. 
</P>
<P>
While the litigation grinds on, Coppola apparently will continue to live well, 
a magnificent bankrupt, in full possession of his manor and businesses, at 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his Napa Valley neighbors believe he will survive this round in style, 
as he has several others. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Fife, a former president of Inglenook, for instance, recently recalled 
that Coppola and his wife once "flew to England for lunch" during an earlier 
financial crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"His bankruptcies and mine," Fife quipped, "are not the same."

JAMES FLANIGAN: TAXING FOR SCHOOLS, INVESTING IN THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governor of New Jersey -- pressed by a lawsuit in the state's highest court 
-- has introduced legislation to reform property tax financing for education in 
an attempt to give poorer, urban school districts something approaching the 
quality of schools in richer suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, the state Supreme Court has ordered the Legislature to make school 
funding more equitable, and the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled last year that the 
education system violated the state constitution. So Kentucky has totally 
reformed its system from curriculum to standards to financing -- putting in a 
half-cent sales tax to help equalize funding between rich districts and poor. 
</P>
<P>
The trend is powerful and spreading. Fresh lawsuits alleging discrimination 
because of unequal funding based on property taxes are pending in eight states 
(Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Oregon, Massachusetts and 
Alabama), and suits may be filed in four more (Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio and 
Virginia). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10 states have overturned their school finance system in the last 
decade and others, such as Colorado, have moved voluntarily to make funding 
more equitable. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is simple: "that the quality of education should not depend on the 
wealth of the local district but of the state as a whole," as the Texas 
constitution puts it. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy, as argued in many lawsuits through the years -- beginning with 
a 1971 case in California -- is that property tax financing leads inevitably to 
inequalities of education because some districts have higher property values, 
and hence more money for schools, than others. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling that the U.S. Constitution says nothing about 
education, has left the issue to individual state courts. And those courts 
lately have been saying with increasing vigor that the way we finance education 
must be changed -- now. In Texas, where Gov. William C. Clements vetoed sales 
taxes earmarked for education reform, the court has appointed its own director 
of schools who says he will take a "Robin Hood" approach and shift state aid 
from wealthier districts to poorer ones. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a trend for the '90s, this is it. The pattern of court decisions 
amounts to nothing less than an expression of the national will that 
educational opportunity be equitable -- and also that educational quality be 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a painless sentiment. Taxes are normally required to offset the gap 
between rich and poor. Kentucky's half-cent sales tax raises $500 million a 
year; Texas' proposed tax would raise even more. Property taxes could go up in 
some areas if state governments cut back on aid to better-off schools to shift 
money to poorer ones. 
</P>
<P>
It's not social engineering, says Texas Lt. Gov. William Hobby: "The aim is not 
to make each district equal -- wealthier districts can spend more on their 
schools if they wish -- but that children in poor districts should have a 
fighting chance." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it a do-gooder cause. What is galvanizing the courts as much as anything 
is recognition by business people of two problems: One is that funding schools 
in their own neighborhoods, while opposing taxes and bond issues to finance 
general education, is shortsighted. The undereducated students in other 
neighborhoods are business' future employees. 
</P>
<P>
Two, a related problem is the quality of education everywhere; a labor force 
that is 25% illiterate is not merely unfortunate, but counterproductive. 
Scholarly studies, such as a recent one from RAND Corp., blame poor basic 
education for stagnant U.S. productivity and the lack of investment in "human 
capital" -- meaning that the schools leave many people almost incapable of 
being trained for today's high-tech world. 
</P>
<P>
A little perspective: We have always had high school dropouts. In fact, in 
1920, only 21% of the students finished high school -- a 79% dropout rate, 
compared to today's 40% or so in some areas. But in 1920, the skills needed for 
work in industry and agriculture were lower than what is demanded today, where 
every job demands knowledge and judgment -- and a country whose students score 
lower than every other nation in math and science tests is at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
We're already spending money -- federal, state and local expenditure on primary 
and secondary education totals $185 billion a year. So, clearly, redistributing 
state aid must be accompanied by other reforms; the Kentucky Supreme Court 
probably had the right idea in ordering a redo of the system from the ground 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody argues that money is the whole solution, says Mary Fulton, a director of 
the Education Commission of the States, a Denver research organization. 
"However, money can buy textbooks and science labs, and it can maintain 
facilities and pay teacher salaries." 
</P>
<P>
Note the shift in emphasis: In the 1980s, it was fashionable to say we can't 
solve problems by throwing money at them; in the '90s, the courts say that's no 
reason to give up. 
</P>
<P>
The result could be the start of improvement in U.S. education or, even more 
important, recovery of the sense of American equality in our public schools. It 
could make all our other problems more manageable.

BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: USING BENEFIT-COST STUDIES TO SET 
REGULATORY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY WEIDENBAUM, MURRAY WEIDENBAUM is director of the Center for the Study 
of American Business and Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor at 
Washington University in St. Louis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of tougher environmental regulation focus almost exclusively on the 
benefits they hope to achieve, while critics seem concerned only with the high 
costs they anticipate. The current debate on the Clean Air Act demonstrates the 
shortcomings -- and also the validity -- of both approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the air will be cleaner if the Clean Air Act is extended, and the 
American people will pay a high price in the process. But given the importance 
of a healthy environment, this is not an either/or question. When we strip away 
the heated rhetoric that almost invariably accompanies discussions of 
environmental issues, we find that the serious questions are in terms of "how 
much" and "how." That is, what are the most effective ways of achieving cleaner 
air, safer drinking water and other environmental goals? 
</P>
<P>
Here, the economic approach to public-policy decision making has something to 
offer. The basic economic questions facing government decision makers are 
twofold: Are the benefits of a specific action worth the costs? Is there a 
better way of achieving those benefits? Society's bottom line is not the impact 
of regulatory actions on government or on business, but the effect on the 
consumer, on the citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit-cost analysis has been used for decades in examining government 
programs. It is neither a revolutionary new idea nor an invention of the far 
right. It has been attacked by both ends of the political spectrum: by the far 
left, because not every proposal for government intervention passes a 
benefit-cost test, and by the far right, because benefit-cost analysis can be 
used to justify government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for incorporating such analysis into public-sector decision making 
is to lead to more efficient use of government resources by subjecting the 
public sector to the same type of quantitative constraints as those used in the 
private sector. In making an investment decision, business executives compare 
costs to expected revenue. If the costs exceed revenue, the investment is not 
considered worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
The governmental decision maker does not face the same constraints. If the 
costs to society of an agency action exceed the benefits, the situation does 
not usually have an adverse impact on the agency. In fact, the administrators 
may not even know about it. Requiring agencies to perform benefit-cost analyses 
helps to counterbalance the strong attraction toward regulatory activity by 
government agencies and their supporters. Otherwise, they can crow about the 
benefits and ignore the costs that are passed through to the consumer by the 
firms they regulate. 
</P>
<P>
A basic relationship of costs and benefits holds for many regulatory programs. 
Typically, the initial regulatory effort -- such as cleaning up the worst 
effects of pollution in a river -- generates benefits significantly greater 
than costs. But the resources required to achieve additional cleanup become 
disproportionately high. At some point the added benefits are substantially 
less than the added costs. 
</P>
<P>
The pulp-and-paper industry spent $3 billion complying with a set of federal 
clean-water standards and achieved a 95% reduction in pollution. But reaching a 
98% reduction level cost the industry an additional $4.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit-cost analysis is a tool for identifying the optimum amount of 
regulation. To an economist, "over-regulation" is not an emotional term; it is 
shorthand for regulation for which the costs to the public are greater than the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The indirect costs, often overlooked, can be great. One researcher estimates 
that 30% of the decline in productivity growth in manufacturing in the 1970s 
can be attributed to the regulations promulgated by the Environmental 
Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
Analysts at Consad Research Corp. estimate that the enactment of the version of 
the Clean Air Act now going through Congress will eliminate more than 200,000 
jobs a year. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation has adversely affected the pace of innovation in the pharmaceutical 
industry, where "regulatory lag" has become well known. The cost of developing 
new and more effective drugs, as a result, has increased substantially. The 
most dramatic example of indirect costs of regulation occurs in the automobile 
industry. Economists estimate that 2,000 to 4,000 lives are lost each year 
because complying with fuel economy standards requires companies to build cars 
that are lighter, and thus less safe. 
</P>
<P>
When it is not feasible to put a dollar sign on the benefits, analysts can rank 
the cost-effectiveness of alternatives. These studies help policy-makers 
identify least-cost solutions to accomplish the same objective. This approach 
is useful in programs to reduce personal hazards. Instead of dealing with such 
an imponderable question as the value of a human life, the emphasis shifts to 
identifying the regulatory approach that maximizes the number of lives saved. 
</P>
<P>
The progress of the Clean Air Act reauthorization furnishes a good (or bad) 
example of the need for cost-effectiveness analysis. Oil and auto interests 
have been battling to see who will be required to control refueling emissions 
that contribute to smog. Whether controls are required at service station gas 
pumps, or canisters are required on new cars (on-board controls), the same 
reductions in smog-related emissions are possible. 
</P>
<P>
There are pros and cons accompanying each approach. The big advantage of 
controls at the pump is that they produce immediate results, whereas placing 
devices on new cars requires a complete turnover in the existing fleet of autos 
to produce the same outcome. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it is much easier for government to regulate a relatively 
few car manufacturers than thousands of gasoline retailers. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, tighter controls on gas pumps, it is estimated, will reduce 
hydrocarbon emissions in dirty air areas at a cost of $1,000 a ton or less, 
whereas removing a ton of hydrocarbon using the on-board solution may cost 
twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress seems likely to avoid making a difficult choice by requiring both 
sets of controls. That is the worst alternative. The combined strategy 
significantly increases costs while producing no added benefits. 
</P>
<P>
That would be comparable to the individual who simultaneously wears a belt and 
suspenders to hold up his pants -- incurring two sets of costs to achieve one 
set of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Critics offended by the notion of subjecting regulation to benefit-cost or 
cost-effectiveness tests unwittingly expose the weakness of their position. 
They must fear that their pet rules would flunk the test. After all, showing 
that a regulatory activity generates an excess of benefits is a strong 
justification for continuing it. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit-cost analysis is neutral, giving equal weight to a dollar of benefits 
and a dollar of costs. 
</P>
<P>
Because resources available to safeguard human lives are limited, economists 
become concerned when they see wasteful use of those resources through unwise 
regulation.

BILL WOULD PROTECT PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt about it, biotechnology companies -- especially those making drugs -- 
have a patent problem. Biotech patents, particularly those covering production 
processes but even, in many cases, the final product, are difficult to get and 
often highly contested. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, to a large measure, stems from the essence of the work: What 
biotechnology makes really isn't all that new. And in patents, the emphasis is 
on new. 
</P>
<P>
The products that are expected to be biotech's blockbusters, such as growth 
hormones, insulin, interferons and erythropoietin, are, simply put, 
reproductions of what already exists in nature -- in our own bodies, in fact. 
What's new in biotech is the ability to identify and isolate the genetic coding 
for these substances and then produce vast quantities of them in their purified 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
In biotech, the production, or manufacturing techniques -- which process 
patents are designed to cover -- are also part of nature. Biotech companies use 
cells as miniature factories; as the cell reproduces itself, it also reproduces 
the desired genetic material that has been inserted into it. Such techniques 
are as "obvious" to a biologist as, say, the production method for making an 
everyday pudding -- mixing the ingredients and stirring them over heat -- is to 
an average cook. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just as a cook or even a maker of packaged pudding mix can't patent the 
stir-and-heat process, so is it nearly impossible for a biotech company to 
patent the obvious manufacturing techniques it uses. 
</P>
<P>
The Biotechnology Patent Protection Act proposed by Rep. Frederick C. Boucher 
(D-Va.) would change all that, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Boucher bill would extend patent protection to even obvious or common 
processes as long as novel starting materials were used. In the pudding 
example, if the pudding maker had "invented" a new starting ingredient -- 
perhaps a no-cholesterol egg -- she could, under the provisions of the bill, 
patent the stir-and-heat process that used the new egg in puddings. 
</P>
<P>
Why would she want to? Well, perhaps she couldn't get a patent on her 
low-cholesterol pudding (which would be the case if other pudding makers before 
her had made, perhaps even patented, low-cholesterol pudding using different 
ingredients). And even if she had a patent on her egg, under existing U.S. 
trade laws, foreign cooks could use her egg, make the pudding overseas and 
import it without infringing on her patent. 
</P>
<P>
That, in very simple terms, is what is happening in biotech. Often, researchers 
at universities or even at other companies have identified the final product 
long before a company succeeds in figuring out how to make it in large enough 
quantities to be useful; so it can't obtain a product patent. 
</P>
<P>
The company may be able to patent its discovery of the DNA sequences (genetic 
coding), and even the kind of cells that will be able to serve a factory for 
the desired substance. However, those patents do not really protect the 
companies from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Boucher bill would also amend trade laws so that foreign-made products that 
infringed upon these new process patents, and even on the starting materials 
patents, would be stopped from coming into the country. 
</P>
<P>
Patent experts -- even those from companies supporting the bill -- don't see 
the proposed legislation as a balm for all their patent troubles. The potential 
for many different patents incorporating the same process could be troublesome, 
and license arrangements could become more complicated. (For example, would 
someone who had license rights to the no-cholesterol egg have to pay additional 
license fees to use the egg in the stir-and-heat process?) 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, said John E. Kittle, director of the U.S. Patent Office's 
biotechnology examination group, there will be "a lot of judicial 
interpretation of where the property line is drawn." DONNA K. H. WALTERS

SHOULD WE EASE ANTITRUST LAWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are U.S. antitrust laws obsolete? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a move in Congress to repeal parts of federal antitrust law that 
prohibit large companies from producing goods jointly. The idea is that by 
acting together -- particularly in risky ventures such as computer chips -- 
U.S. companies would better compete globally. The proposed law would not only 
allow joint ventures but would also limit penalties for activities found to be 
anti-competitive by reducing damages that could be awarded to companies 
squeezed out of the market. The laws have already been modified somewhat: In 
1984, the part of the law restricting joint research and development ventures 
was modified. 
</P>
<P>
 For a debate on easing antitrust laws, free-lance writer Sharon Bernstein 
interviewed former Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Paul McGrath, who directed the 
Justice Department's antitrust division during the Reagan Administration's 
first term and supports the changes. McGrath, now a partner in the New York law 
firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp; Wood, represented U.S. Memories, 
the failed chip industry venture, in hearings before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For an opposing view, she also interviewed Michael E. Porter, a Harvard 
Business School professor whose book, "The Competitive Advantage of Nations," 
analyzes antitrust issues with regard to global competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Should antitrust laws be modified to allow for joint manufacturing ventures? 
</P>
<P>
McGrath: Yes, for two reasons. One, joint manufacturing ventures almost never 
raise antitrust problems. Historically, there's almost no example of such a 
venture raising antitrust problems. 
</P>
<P>
Two, in our very expensive, complicated world, such ventures can be critical to 
success in a number of fields. Take semiconductors. The interest of U.S. 
companies in manufacturing certain kinds of semiconductors has dwindled as the 
expense of building plants and the risk becomes greater. The risk is greater 
because of the short life cycle of these products. 
</P>
<P>
Porter: Any joint production venture that has important benefits for 
competition is already perfectly acceptable under antitrust laws. Official 
relaxation would be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller companies that have a modest share of an industry already have 
considerable flexibility to enter into joint agreements. They're handled by the 
rule of reason (in the courts), and there's been virtually no questions. What 
is needing antitrust scrutiny is joint ventures by industry leaders, and these 
are the ones that would be allowed under the proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
If joint ventures are allowed, is anti-competitive activity a risk? 
</P>
<P>
Porter: Yes. That's the fundamental problem. Joint production ventures 
involving leading companies limit individual company investments in plants and 
in new-process technology, and reduce the pressure of competition which forces 
everybody to improve to maintain their position. 
</P>
<P>
Joint production ventures are based on the idea that if you allow companies to 
do things jointly you eliminate overproduction and encourage economies of 
scale. What we learn from other countries whose operations are world class is 
that this is extremely rare. Joint production ventures threaten the health and 
vigor of competition. Although they may achieve some short-term efficiencies, 
they sap the dynamism of the industry as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath: The kind of statute that has been proposed by the Administration would 
still subject a company to criminal prosecution if there was illegal price 
fixing or something of that sort. 
</P>
<P>
Can those risks be guarded against? If so, how? 
</P>
<P>
McGrath: The legislative history would spell out the kinds of situations you 
would worry about. For example, U.S. Memories would have involved a very small 
percentage of companies that were manufacturing the particular kind of product. 
In legislative history, you'd make it clear that where companies that have less 
than 30% of a market are putting together a joint venture, that almost is never 
going to cause a problem. You can define the safe harbors in terms of the 
percent of the market covered, whether there is ease of entry into the market 
and so on. That's really where you get the protection. If the entry into the 
market or size of market indicates that there's a problem, then the government 
can enter into it. 
</P>
<P>
Porter: I don't believe that there are any practical ways of guarding against 
the risk, and what is more significant is that there is no evidence that the 
supposed benefits of these ventures are significant in any industry. Let's take 
the semiconductor industry. There's a lot of discussion about how we need joint 
production in memory (computer chip) ventures. If you look at the semiconductor 
industry in Japan, you'll find that there are 13 companies making memory chips. 
All of those companies are doing very well. So the idea that we need to have 
one plant in this country to make them doesn't add up; it doesn't fit the rules 
of logic. 
</P>
<P>
How does the global nature of the marketplace play into the arguments for and 
against the modifications? 
</P>
<P>
McGrath: It generally plays pretty directly into it. First, if you don't take 
into account global markets, you're going to overstate the hold on a market 
that U.S. companies have. If U.S. companies really only have a quarter of 
worldwide production of a product that in fact moves in international trade, 
they're not going to be able to monopolize the market for the product. They 
don't have enough of the market. 
</P>
<P>
If we prevent U.S. companies from entering into joint ventures -- saying that 
it will make them less competitive at home -- the result is, we will actually 
hurt U.S. companies and hurt competition. 
</P>
<P>
Porter: I don't believe that companies compete against countries. That is a 
stylized view of international competition promoted by those who view Japan in 
particular as a tightly managed economy. But if we look closely at Japan, we 
see numerous companies that compete fiercely, that hate each other's guts. And 
we see numerous examples where the Japanese government has asked companies to 
do things, and they say no. The Japanese government attempted to consolidate 
the auto industry, and the companies said no. If we look at the facts and try 
to understand where nations are winning, what we're finding is that the key is 
having companies that compete. 
</P>
<P>
And the notion that we should merge all our U.S. companies or have them all 
cooperate comes from a misguided idea of what makes for success. The most 
successful U.S. industries are the ones with the most competition: software, 
consumer packaged goods, business services, medical-related products and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Where should the United States be in 10 years in terms of antitrust regulation 
and joint ventures? 
</P>
<P>
McGrath: U.S. companies all ought to have in their mind cooperative ventures in 
relation to more and more aspects of their business. Companies will be even 
more internationalized than they are today, and we'll have more companies with 
production capacity in different parts of the world, capacity which they may 
own directly and may share with joint ventures. I think joint ventures will 
become more complex as research and development, and the tools of research and 
development, become more complex. 
</P>
<P>
Porter: We're now in a period where we're questioning one of our most basic 
values, and that's competition. If you look at antitrust, if you look at 
collaboration, if you look at trade policy, copyright law, in one area after 
another with very elaborate excuses we're trying to make arguments as to why we 
shouldn't compete anymore. What we've learned from industries all over the 
world is that this doesn't work. It saps dynamism and it saps improvement.

There is an irony in your article regarding Chrysler Corp.'s huge losses and 
its attempt to regain the buying public's confidence ("Iacocca Back in 
Spotlight, but It's Just Not the Same," May 18). 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a day goes by without reading the public outcry over the Japanese buying 
America piece by piece, yet the very voices that cry are likely to own a 
Japanese car, camcorder, television or compact disc player.

So where do these people think the money to buy America is coming from?

COMPETENCE RULES AT MORE VISIONARY FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world economy is becoming more integrated daily. Japan's ethnocentricity is 
keeping Japan from becoming a truly great power . . . and now comes Nissan and 
other Japanese companies with an apparent policy of fragmenting management and 
decision making along nationality lines. 
</P>
<P>
("Some Japanese Firms Moving to Segregate Staff," May 23). 
</P>
<P>
If the reports are true, more forward-looking companies -- Honda, Kawai and 
others -- should gear up to capture an even greater share of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
My 15-year experience with Kawai, a wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, has been 
just the opposite. Kawai has actively integrated managers, be they foreign or 
American, into their decision-making process. This Kawai policy is based upon 
competence, not nationality.

BEST SHOTS IN THIS PARK NEED A LENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deer appeared as if conjured out of the mist that lay on Big Meadows after 
an afternoon rain. We began to count . . . one deer, then another, then 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, from behind a tall shrub, a spotted fawn stepped into view. It seemed 
cast right out of Walt Disney's "Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, however, there was no tragic scene of the fawn's mother being 
shot by a hunter's bullet. All the deer in Shenandoah National Park, which is 
divided down the middle by scenic Skyline Drive, are protected by the National 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
That protection explains the rather fearless behavior of Shenandoah's deer. 
Whether in Big Meadows, a too-obvious name for what is the only large tract of 
cleared land in the park, or at the edge of one of several camping grounds, 
these deer seem to hardly notice the human beings that elsewhere might be their 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
So engrossed are they in feeding on the park's abundance that they will 
approach close enough for even an amateur photographer to shoot a wildlife 
portrait. And that is the only sort of shooting that ever happens here. 
</P>
<P>
Established by Congress in 1926 and dedicated by President Franklin Roosevelt 
10 years later, Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive, which was completed 
by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939, encompasses 280 square miles of the 
Shenandoah River Valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
Where once were mountain farms, now forests of hickory, oak and pine cover the 
land. According to a National Park Service brochure, "Vegetative restoration 
has been so complete that in 1976 Congress designated two-fifths of the park as 
wilderness. Deer, bear, bobcat, turkey and other animals that were formerly 
rare or absent have returned." 
</P>
<P>
The return of the forest, however, disrupted some human lives. Those who lived 
here when the park was established were removed by state and federal officials. 
On a ride along Skyline Drive, one may invoke those people's spirit on a car 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
Small stations play an eclectic blend of bluegrass and other country music 
styles, from the commercial sound of Dolly Parton to the traditionalist Johnson 
Mountain Boys. 
</P>
<P>
While Skyline Drive emphasizes the thrill of panoramic, mountainside views, the 
beginning of a Shenandoah Park tour takes one underground. At Front Royal, a 
series of large roadside signs point the way to "Virginia's Famous" Skyline 
Caverns. 
</P>
<P>
For $8, one is treated to a wacky cave tour that covers science, religion and 
the delight of spelunking. With multicolored lights adding a touch of kitsch, 
the cave, discovered in 1937, discloses its hidden treasures. 
</P>
<P>
According to a flashlight-toting guide, Skyline Caverns is the only cave in the 
world that is home to anthodites -- "the orchids of the mineral kingdom" -- 
white, spiny, crystal formations that cling to the damp rock ceiling and whose 
tendrils seem to grow upward in defiance of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Other features of the cave also defy credibility, among them "the Shrine," 
where a stumpy, lumpy stalagmite is said to resemble Jesus Christ. In another 
room, the guide points out what appears to be Dolly Parton floating on her 
back. 
</P>
<P>
As a public wildlife preserve, Shenandoah Park and Skyline Drive are carefully 
preserved from commercialism. The winding road, bordered by trees and in late 
spring, blossoming mountain laurel, rises and falls. Except for the calls of 
warblers and other birds, a general silence prevails. 
</P>
<P>
At many scenic overlooks, visitors may view valley and mountain ranges that 
take in miles of countryside. The Blue Ridge Mountains earn their name and so, 
too, do the many indigos -- birds of a deep blue plumage -- that flit from tree 
to tree. Other creatures also take in the views, especially broad-winged hawks 
that circle for prey. 
</P>
<P>
Four campsites dot Skyline Drive (a fifth, Dundo Group Camp, is reserved for 
youth groups). We stopped for the night at Loft Mountain, about 80 miles from 
Front Royal. 
</P>
<P>
As we explored the grounds before dinner, we saw and trailed for quite a while 
a group of deer grazing on saplings and other vegetation. The animals would 
sometimes approach campsites only to back away, perhaps because of the smell of 
fires and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way we saw several signs noting, "This is Bear Country," topped with 
illustrations of cute brown bears about as frightening as Yogi and Boo-boo. 
</P>
<P>
Park rangers had given us the usual warnings: Don't leave food out, don't put 
food in your tent when you sleep. But we considered it all perfunctory. And as 
we cooked our hot dogs, we made jokes about inviting some bears for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Our meal done and a fog rolling in across the campground, we relaxed with cups 
of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Behind us we heard a belch. I thought it was some fellow who had too many 
beers. Leaving my companion at the fireside, I went to the car for the lantern. 
I had my head about as far inside the trunk as it would go when behind me, 
about 10 feet away, came another belch, deep and long. 
</P>
<P>
Several screaming fits later, we had driven to the ranger station. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a bear in our campsite," I said, so overcome with fear I was almost -- 
honestly -- at the point of tears. 
</P>
<P>
The ranger almost yawned or smiled, I'm not sure which, and spoke calmly. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we know about them. They come around looking for handouts," he said. "We 
had one the other night putting a dent in a trailer going after some food, but 
there's nothing to worry about. You're not going to let this spoil your 
vacation, are you? Where you from?" 
</P>
<P>
I answered and the ranger almost yawned or smiled again, and continued to 
reassure us we would be safe as long as we took the proper precautions. With 
bears capable of putting dents in trailers, I wondered what one would do to our 
tiny tent. 
</P>
<P>
I did not get much sleep that night, and things got even worse when I realized 
there were several sugar packets still in my pockets even though I thought I 
had cleaned up every scrap and crumb of food in the camp for 50 yards around. 
</P>
<P>
Would the bear smell the sugar? It is the sort of question one can mull over 
for hours while zipped up in a sleeping bag. For a city kid, I thought as I lay 
awake, nature is not only a gentle, cuddly deer. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Shenandoah National Park's reclamation of the wilderness around 
the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia is that there is room in that country now 
for deer and for bear and for people to roam free and prowl through campsites. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, after a breakfast of coffee and jelly sandwiches, we began to 
take up our tent when we were again joined by company. From the woods behind us 
a deer appeared, approached the picnic table where we had left our food and 
gobbled up a leftover jelly sandwich.

WHERE THE WHITE WATER CAN STILL BE FOUND IN THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Information: White-water rafting trips vary widely in price, depending on the 
rafter's age, duration of the trip and accommodations. Free information, advice 
and bookings are available by telephoning a consultant at Friends of the River 
at (415) 771-0400. 
</P>
<P>
Also, information, including prices and schedules, will be mailed to those who 
request them from the Western River Guides Assn. message service at (800) 
552-3625. 
</P>
<P>
River Classifications: Rivers are classed by degree of danger and difficulty, 
as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Class I: Flowing ripples. No problems for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Class II: Some rapids, obstacles and small falls, but relatively tame. 
</P>
<P>
Class III: Some major white water, with good drops and obstacles. Children OK 
but good guide/expertise required. 
</P>
<P>
Class IV: Strong hydraulics, larger drops, adventurous rapids. Precise 
maneuvering requires very experienced guide. Ages 14-up only recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Class V: Violent currents and drops, with danger of capsizing. Advance scouting 
advised. Not for novices. 
</P>
<P>
Class VI: Don't even think about it. 
</P>
<P>
The West's Best Rafting Rivers: 
</P>
<P>
South Fork American (Class III): West Coast's most popular rafting river may 
not be able to be run all year but will have sufficient flows all summer. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Fork American (Classes III to V): Good flows six days a week. For now, 
the power company turns off the water on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
North Fork American (Class IV): With no upstream reservoir, its flow is 
finished for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Kern (Class III-IV): Worthwhile flows will be released through June and July; 
August seems doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Kings (Class III): Would rate Class IV with heavy flows, but still has more 
water than any other Sierra river and will be good through June. 
</P>
<P>
Tuolumne (Class IV): Power release schedule indicates it will be strong all 
summer. The Cherry Creek portion above the regular run rates V-plus, perhaps 
the most challenging run in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Merced (Class III-IV): Will probably shut down in early June. Lower flows 
increase the technical challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Main (Old) Fork Stanislaus (Class III): This historic Mother Lode river, quiet 
for nine years, is making a comeback, with upstream releases to refill the New 
Melones Reservoir. Should be good all summer. 
</P>
<P>
North and Lower Forks Stanislaus (Classes IV-V): Through for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon (California/Class V): Had a short run before trickling out. 
</P>
<P>
Trinity/Burnt Ranch Gorge (Class V): Good through June, OK in July, finished by 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Upper Klamath (Class IV): Good through summer, except for two-week closure in 
mid-July for power plant maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Lower Klamath (Class I-II): Backed by large reservoir and mandate to protect 
the fishery, will be strong all summer. 
</P>
<P>
Rogue (Class III): Far enough north for good snow pack, and flows supported by 
fishery mandates. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado/Grand Canyon (Class I-IV): Generally unaffected by drought years, with 
normal releases from Lake Powell. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado/Cataract Canyon (Class III): Should run into August, although lower 
flows reduce it from Class IV. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon (Idaho/Class IV): Smaller tributaries down, but main river has always 
been able to be run all summer. Rich Roberts

THE TRUTH (SORT OF) ABOUT RAFTING THE COLORADO 
</P>

</P>

PHANTOM RANCH, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's our 11th night in the Grand Canyon. The wind has been grinding us all day. 
On the rafts it was so bad that we had to hunker down, crowded together while 
an inch of chilly water sloshed on the rubber floor. You can never bail a boat 
quite dry. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody except the oarsman kept a low profile as the gusts from the west 
tried to shove us back upriver. For long spells the boats would stall, hard 
rowing and the current managing only to hold us stationary as the wind forced 
whole deserts of sand into our eyes and ears and nostrils and in under every 
layer of clothing. Finally we gave up and sought refuge on shore. 
</P>
<P>
I flopped my sleeping bag in the lee of a colossal boulder, hoping it might 
provide a windbreak. Seconds after I carefully positioned the ground cloth and 
weighted the corners with rocks, then did the same for the bag, the brown 
grains were drifting over everything. 
</P>
<P>
The boulder created an eddy that threw sand at me from all directions. I 
couldn't see, talk or think. Exhausted from fighting it, I lay down, groped for 
the plastic flask and had a ration of bourbon and grit. And began to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado River offers arguably the premier and most accessible wilderness 
trip in the United States. Other places need names. Talk about the canyon or 
the river, and everybody understands the reference. 
</P>
<P>
Every year 20,000 people run the Colorado River through the canyon, by motor or 
oar, most on commercial trips that last a week or two and cost about $100 a 
day. By 11 days into my trip it was clear that many of us didn't have the 
faintest what we were getting into. 
</P>
<P>
The brochures are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Rafting company brochures are resplendent with color photographs of tourists 
happily crashing rapids or drifting serenely. They don't show anybody eating 
sand or trying to remove it from the soap, the guacamole or the sleeping bag. 
They don't show anybody bailing out the raft. 
</P>
<P>
What you get is vivid portrayals of bighorn sheep and lunker trout, but nary a 
trace of the canyon's most prevalent wildlife -- clouds of annoying bats and 
hordes of biting red ants. 
</P>
<P>
It's as if the adventure-travel industry is afraid to admit that adventure is 
defined by adversity. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has the wrong impression. Plenty of us want things to go very 
unsmoothly. That's why we're out here and not sitting at home. But we'd 
appreciate an up-front approach. So, as we proceeded downriver, each evening as 
the bats comb my hair I've been scrawling the first truly honest 
adventure-travel brochure. 
</P>
<P>
TIP No. 1: Writing at night with a flashlight clenched between your teeth, 
saving grand thoughts in waterlogged journals like many river tourists do, you 
create your own little ecosystem. The light attracts insects that swarm around 
your head. The insects, in turn, attract a larger swarm of bats. Anybody who 
minds being repeatedly brushed by furry wings, be warned. Jot it down before 
dark or take a tape recorder so you can speak it instead of write it. 
</P>
<P>
TRY TO BE HIP: To avoid coming off like a tenderfoot, study the vocabulary of 
the river before you go. Get used to calling the passengers "peeps" -- an 
approximation, apparently, of the noise guides say we make incessantly and at 
the highest pitch in rapids. When a guide shouts, "photo opportunity!" realize 
that it means some peeps are about to be dumped overboard. 
</P>
<P>
IT ISN'T WALDEN POND: You get surprisingly small opportunity for solitude and 
introspection. An average party of five rafts carries 16 peeps, four guides and 
two trainees. On whichever raft you choose to ride for the day (boat politics), 
you're in close company with varying combinations of these strangers. 
Conversation, no matter how inane, is inescapable, and after the first hundred 
exclamations over sculpted red rock, it tends to dwell on more mundane matters 
such as dogs left back home, tax laws and golf handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
YUPPIE ALERT: Likewise, while it might happen, don't count on meeting peeps who 
are heavily into wilderness recreation. The river is a comfort-oriented trip 
that draws a clientele on the far end of the scale from, say, backpackers or 
other outdoor types. While there are some monster rapids, less than 10% of the 
river is white water. 
</P>
<P>
For most of each day you sit like a bus passenger while the rock goes by, 
stopping to consume prepared feasts of stuffed pork chops and fresh melon 
salads, red wine and occasional champagne. Some of the women wonder which pair 
of earrings to wear to run Lava Falls. Businessmen have brought along their 
cards and are handing them out. One guy smells funny, and it turns out to be 
cologne. 
</P>
<P>
THE BEST RIDE ON THE RIVER IS WITH THE WORST GUIDE: Face it, you run a river to 
get wet, seeking the thrill of white water. The most experienced guides know 
the river so well that they make treacherous rapids seem easy, flat and smooth, 
with no more kick than a carnival ride. Some of them don't even like to get 
wet. Novice guides, on the other hand, can get into trouble on ripples. For a 
real rush, a sudden swamping and swim (you have a life jacket) or a tilting 
rebound off the rocks, ride with the youngster who's nervous. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T TRY TO BE HIP AROUND THE GUIDES: These river rats suffer bad backs and 
wear themselves out rowing thousands of miles over the years, and they live in 
a dilemma: They devote themselves to working in a wilderness hoping for peace, 
but have to be around one gaggle of peeps after another. So it's understandable 
when they get a little, uh, surly. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T PLAY HORSESHOES WITH THE GUIDES: They pound stakes into the beaches and 
go at it around sunset, just as the bats are taking wing. If you think you're 
any good, remember this: They've had few distractions from perfecting their 
game, and are not averse to teaching peeps some humility. If you do play, don't 
bet on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
SWITCH ON THE RIVER: For the best water, persuade friends around the West to 
use as much electrical power as they can, to keep their lights on day and night 
and run their air conditioners, garbage disposers, microwaves, VCRs and other 
electrical appliances continuously during your trip. 
</P>
<P>
Since Glen Canyon Dam and its turbines just upstream of the Grand Canyon were 
built, river flow has been regulated by regional demand for power. On the 
mechanical river, water level fluctuates widely (10 feet or more) each day, 
peaking when electric demand is highest. At low water it takes a lot more 
rowing to get downriver, and every extra kilowatt being used quickens the flow 
and the rush over rapids. 
</P>
<P>
A WILDERNESS OF ROCK AND ROLL: Some guides and peeps do the canyon while 
plugged in to Walkmans. That's OK. Others take along boom boxes with extra 
speakers. That's not. The racket resonates between canyon walls. Those not into 
man-made canyon rock, consider ear plugs. 
</P>
<P>
"HAVING FUN YET?" is the river's "howdy." The guides hurl it at each other and 
the peeps at every opportunity, yukking it up. Sometimes it goes too far, even 
for them. On Day 9, a long haul on flat water against the wind after a morning 
of solid rapids, four of us and a guide are huddled on a raft, soaked and 
shivering in endless canyon shadow. As we lugged past a private raft group that 
was on a more leisurely schedule, some yahoo hollered over at us, "Havin' fun 
yet?" We stared back, hollow-eyed, our guide grunting with each dig of his 
oars. 
</P>
<P>
THE WIND IS ALWAYS AGAINST YOU. The guides attempt to explain it -- something 
about hot air off the desert rushing uphill and upriver through the canyon. The 
phenomenon seems to be related to the rafts: As we got deeper into the canyon 
the wind started blowing as soon as we put the rafts on the river in the 
morning and stopped when we made camp, except for the evenings when it blew 
some more. 
</P>
<P>
TAKE OUT DENTAL INSURANCE. The Ansazi Indians who populated the canyon a 
century ago had a life expectancy of maybe 30 years, probably because all the 
sand mixed in their food wore their teeth to nubbins. You'll get a first-hand 
feel for what did them in. 
</P>
<P>
THE CHOPPER RELEASE CLAUSE. With some relish, the guides tell stories about 
peeps feeling trapped by the rock walls or terrified by the rapids and freaking 
out. If you're tempted, resist. The only escape once you're on the river is a 
hike out at the halfway point, Phantom Ranch, up a steep nine-mile trail 
reeking of pack mule. 
</P>
<P>
The guides can, however, invoke the chopper release clause -- summoning a 
helicopter to pluck you back to the world of hot showers and comfortable beds. 
Remember, though, that you'll lose face and shell out up to $500 on top of the 
couple of thousand you're already in for. 
</P>
<P>
NO CAMPFIRE STORIES: National Park Service regulations (most of the canyon is 
in the park) prohibit back-country campfires. The only flames you'll see are on 
the gas cook stoves and from the burnable trash that's ignited after dinner in 
a big cast-iron pan (so that the ashes can be packed out with the rest of the 
trash). 
</P>
<P>
THE MOST COMMON SOUND: In this stretch of wilderness it's not the whistle of 
the canyon wren or the invigorating roar of white water but the "tthhhpppp" of 
canyon goop. You'll hear it all day long on the rafts, as everybody squeezes on 
layer upon layer of sun block that quickly get washed away by sweat and rapids. 
Even so, after weeks of being continually soaked by the high-salt river water 
and dried by the desert sun, your skin will look like the floor of Death Valley 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED BY THIS BROCHURE: No words or photos adequately describe 
how the light plays on the rock -- you have to come down here and see it. The 
red rock is stunning. All this water in the desert is magic. By the thousands, 
the trout are fat and gorgeous. Copper salts really do color two tributaries a 
stunning turquoise, the Little Colorado and Havasu Creek. 
</P>
<P>
At night, gazing up at the slice of sky, you can't go 10 minutes without seeing 
a shooting star. The side hikes explore canyons that are lush with springs and 
exotic greenery. You'll probably see some very wild and reclusive bighorn 
sheep; they'll let you get closer on a raft than you could ever get on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Once you grow accustomed to it, no bed is more comfortable than sand. If you're 
lucky, you'll get a thunderstorm striking off the walls and creating countless 
waterfalls. The wind can be bad, and that's good. 
</P>
<P>
PREPARE FOR RE-ENTRY, OR DON'T: All it takes is a five-minute jolt back in 
civilization to make you realize what isn't down on the river in the canyon: 
News, telephones, mail, carburetor trouble, TV, computers, alarm clocks, 
tail-gaters, fluorescent lights, roofs, walls, floors, windows that don't open, 
the need for windows of any kind, or doors, locks, keys, money, credit cards, 
ID, politics, government, advertising and a very broad etcetera covering most 
of the unpleasant realities of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised by the impulse to not leave, to follow the river down to the 
Gulf of California and mosey along in Mexico to who knows where. But that's a 
whole other brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Afloat in Grand Canyon 
</P>
<P>
When to go: River-running companies generally offer Grand Canyon trips from 
late April into November. Summer is the busy but sunbaked season -- daily high 
temperatures on the river often top 100 degrees. Cooling off is as easy as 
dunking yourself in the river, but milder weather (and less congestion on the 
river) make spring and fall the prime seasons. 
</P>
<P>
How to go: Grand Canyon National Park can provide a list of more than a dozen 
river-running companies offering motor-powered trips, oar trips, or both. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid the motor trips; if you're seeking noise and exhaust fumes, stay home. 
Sure, oar trips take longer to cover the same territory. But if you don't have 
two weeks to see the whole canyon, you can see the first half (the elegant, 
sculpted red rock of the Marble Canyon stretch) in five days, or the second 
half (including the turquoise waterfalls of Havasu Canyon) in a week or so. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment: You can travel by inflatable raft or dory (a hard-hulled rowboat); 
the rafts ride a little smoother, while the dories bob and roll and give you a 
better feel for every nuance of current. Either way is fine.

CODE SHARING BY THE AIRLINES RAISES ONE QUERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently booked a flight on a major airline but found I was flying 
on a smaller one with which it has an agreement. Is this legal? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Agreements by which two airlines share a common code or identification 
are legal. However, travel agents or the carriers are required to tell 
consumers which airline is providing the service. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there another Soviet railroad besides the Trans-Siberian that carries 
tourists? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Soviet Union has several train services, including the Baikal-Amur main 
line (BAM), a northern alternative to the Trans-Siberian. There is also an 
express between Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently mentioned a Guinness World's Record Museum in New York City. 
Isn't it in Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Las Vegas counterpart of the New York City museum opened in April, 
offering a variety of displays on weather, space, sports, animals,

London, Niagara Falls and Gatlinburg, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The American Automobile Assn. says there has been a big increase in 
complaints about housekeeping in domestic hotels. Isn't there a rating service 
such as Europe's Guide Michelin? 
</P>
<P>
 A: AAA rates thousands of hotels and publishes its findings for association 
members. The Mobil guidebooks, available at bookstores, also grade hotels and 
motels, and various other guidebooks provide travel writers' appraisals of 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My travel agent says that only a doctor's certificate will get me a refund 
on a nonrefundable ticket. Doesn't a non-medical emergency qualify? 
</P>
<P>

other extenuating circumstances for refunds of tickets that cannot be canceled. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
A. Falconry Center, Newent, Gloucestershire, England, has the largest 
collection of falcons, eagles, buzzards, hawks, kites, owls and vultures. 
Visitors can photograph birds from a few feet. Falconry instruction also is 
given. The center is open six days a week (closed Tuesdays) from February 
through November. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There used to be cruises on the Great Lakes. Are there any this summer?

YOUTH BEAT: CYCLING THROUGH HOLLAND WITH A BARGE IN TOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AMSTERDAM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This country is ideal for cyclists. Not only is it possible to pedal alongside 
the canals but your hotel can meet you at a different point each evening. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago a Dutch company, Cycletours, introduced moderately priced tours 
that combined bicycling with canal boat accommodations. It's been so successful 
that a second route is being introduced this year. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 million of the Netherlands' 14 million people are cyclists and, as 
taxpayers, have supported a 6,200-mile network of bike paths and lanes that 
crisscross the country. 
</P>
<P>
With Cycletours, bicyclists cover 20 to 30 miles a day, either with the group 
and guide or at their own pace, following a specific set of route instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The lodging, aboard a converted 108-foot canal barge, sails through the canals 
and meets the riders each evening. Cyclists, when they choose, can take breaks 
during the seven-day trip and relax on board. 
</P>
<P>
Barges have a galley, a large dining/lounge area and two showers. They sleep up 
to 24 passengers in two- and four-berth cabins. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who book into four-berth cabins are charged 695 guilders (about 
$390 U.S.) a week. A twin cabin is 795 guilders (about $447 U.S.) per person a 
week. Rates include bikes, breakfasts, dinners and self-packed lunches. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-night Cycletours programs leave Amsterdam each Saturday until 
mid-September. You'll find its office at Keizersgracht 181 in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is also well-suited to the "do-it-yourself" cycle tourist. 
Rental bikes are available at more than 100 rail stations throughout the 
country at an average rate of $4 a day or $15 a week. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to get away from Amsterdam for the day, join Ena's Bike Tours. 
Daily departure during the summer is at 10 a.m. from Amstel rail station. 
</P>
<P>
Guided groups visit a working windmill, a cheese-making farm and take a boat 
ride. The $21 fee includes use of a bike. And take along a bathing suit for 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
A new company, Yellow Bike Guided Tours, also is offering bike programs. 
</P>
<P>
Several times a day, starting at 9 a.m., it conducts a 3 1/2-hour guided, 
historic, city cycling tour, departing from Beurs van Berlage, Damrak 247. Cost 
is $14. 
</P>
<P>
But don't try Amsterdam by bike right after an overseas flight. Get over jet 
lag first. Also, watch out for vehicles. Although most Dutch drivers respect 
the cyclists, it's the other drivers who contribute to the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to cycle away from the city, join a 6 1/2-hour Waterland Tour 
that goes 19 miles north through a nature reserve to a windmill, a 
cheese-making farm and a wooden shoe factory. 
</P>
<P>
The end is at Marken, famous for its colorful wooden houses and residents in 
traditional Dutch costumes. Participants return to Amsterdam by bus. 
</P>
<P>
Cost is $22. The tour departs at 8:30 a.m. from Beurs van Berlage, or at noon 
from the Tourist Information Office at Amsterdam's Central Station. 
</P>
<P>
More information, such as route suggestions, package tours, cycling events, 
traffic rules, accommodations, maps and detail on transporting bicycles is 
covered in the publication "Cycling In Holland." For a free copy, contact the 
Netherlands Board of Tourism, Suite 305, 90 New Montgomery St., San Francisco 
94105; (415) 543-6772.

The Swiss National Tourist Office is offering a free booklet entitled "Season 
for Seniors," published by the Swiss Hotel Assn. The brochure lists off-season 
special prices for seniors in Swiss hotels as well as many year-round 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Most major Swiss cities offer several choices of inns or hotels with senior 
discounts, while almost every town or village lists at least one. Prices, which 
are quoted in Swiss francs, include room, breakfast, service charges and taxes, 
and where applicable, heating. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet lists rates for both single and double rooms, with and without bath 
or shower, extra costs for full or half board, and the time periods when the 
senior discounts apply. Minimum age limit for men is 65 and for women 62. 
However, in the case of couples, only one person need meet the age requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Tourist office spokesmen say that in addition to the "Season for Seniors" 
booklet, they will also send brochures on the Swiss Boat Pass, special events 
in Switzerland 1990, and a booklet on Swiss towns. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain this material, write to the Swiss National Tourist Office, 222 N. 
Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1570, El Segundo 90245, or call (213) 335-5980.

BOOKED FOR TRAVEL: GUIDEBOOK LOOKS AT HIGHS, LOWS OF CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WUDKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"California -- the Ultimate Guidebook," by Ray Riegert, details the state from 
below sea level to more than 11,000 feet in elevation amid redwood forests, 
sun-bleached mining towns, fishing villages, Spanish missions and remnants of 
old wagon trails. 
</P>
<P>
The book divides the state into 13 areas and has 36 specific maps. From posh to 
economical, it provides a cross-section of places to eat, stay and see. Each 
entry comes complete with information on amenities, including vignettes of 
historical note, events or attractions. The text is bright with lots of 
information and doesn't offer a clutter of photos (Ulysses: $13.95). 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Frommer's "1990 New World of Travel" may be among the best all-purpose 
guides. It details new destinations, modes of travel and inexpensive lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
The guide demonstrates with sufficient photos how to separate yourself from 
tour buses, charter flights and camera-toting tourists. It also gives readers 
the opportunity to experience events, life styles, attitudes and cultures 
different from the normal. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 alternative-travel companies and resorts in the United States 
and abroad are listed. 
</P>
<P>
The text discusses brainy tours, health expansion and in-depth explorations of 
the unusual, including classes in Balinese dancing, mask-carving in Bali, 
gourmet cooking, cattle-herding or gold-panning. While reading, you may wonder 
why you ever took some of those other expensive and sometimes dissatisfying 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Information is complete for each destination. A real bargain at $17.95 
(Prentice Hall). 
</P>
<P>
So you had another boring and tiring trip on the road. Maybe it's time to 
discover the unusual: a brief, relaxing, soothing dip into a pool of naturally 
warm springs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot Springs and Hot Pools in the U.S.," by Jayson Loom, David Bybee and 
Marjorie Gersh, detail about 1,500 locations, many of them just short drives 
from each other. 
</P>
<P>
These natural hot springs and pools are in primitive settings. While you soak 
away your tensions you can envision Indian tribes of the past that used the 
same springs for health and spiritual benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The guide zeros in on many sites, some just a few steps from an icy cold 
stream, on cliffs overlooking the crashing surf or in secluded areas. Many of 
the mineral hot-springs resorts furnish massages, special cuisine and sports 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
It includes maps and hundreds of photos. Not to worry about costs, because hot 
springs belong to everyone when they are on public land. The guide is 
comprehensive, with information by region and state (Publishers Group West: 
$17.95). 
</P>
<P>
Most every community in the United States today hosts an annual festival or 
celebration. The Poppy State is no exception. Julie Hicks-Herman and Darrin 
Craig have listed more than 350 of these year-round events in "The 1990 
Festival Hopper's Guide to California." 
</P>
<P>
There's the bean or garlic festivals and stagecoach or street-painting days. 
How about a cantaloupe roundup or crab races? 
</P>
<P>
For an unusual adventure try snow golf and snow softball contests at Lake 
Tahoe. All events feature food booths, art and crafts, wine tasting, parades, 
live music and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
For only $11.95, the guide is an excellent introduction to some unusual 
entertainment. It also discusses camping spots, RV facilities, and places to 
stay and eat. Each event is pinpointed on maps and offers phone numbers for 
more information. (Creative Chaos). 
</P>
<P>
For your next vacation, why not stay in a condo? Pamela Lanier's "Condo 
Vacations" lists more than 20,000 units available in the United States, Hawaii, 
the Caribbean and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Many feature suites with a minimum of one bedroom and sleeper sofas. Most have 
complete kitchens, heat and air-conditioning units and include color and cable 
TV. Daily maid service and baby sitters also are available. Many accommodations 
feature bathrooms with tubs or Jacuzzis. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to cut costs, you can dine in the quiet of your own place instead 
of eating out. It's sort of like having your cake and eating there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Each entry furnishes phone numbers, addresses and tells where to get more 
information. It's a bargain for $14.95 at bookstores from Ten Speed Prees.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: TRY THESE VISUAL TASTES OF HUNGARY AND GREECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hungary" (Fodor's Video Travel Guide, 1989, 60 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Fodor, born in Hungary, returned to his homeland to film this video. His 
firsthand knowledge and narration plus a capable film crew make it one of the 
best in the Fodor series. 
</P>
<P>
Budapest is a melange of street scenes lively with performers and sidewalk 
cafes. You'll see the huge Heroes' Square, Castle Hill, Matthias Church and 
Fisherman's Bastion, from which there is a panoramic view of the city and of 
the Danube River that divides its parts, Buda and Pest. Hungary comes off as a 
country rich in history and art. 
</P>
<P>
In Budapest, the Western traveler can be comfortable in modern hotels and is 
entertained by Western-style nightlife that includes discos and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
On a Danube River trip, a boat sails to Esztergom and its immense cathedral, 
stopping also at Pannonhalma Abbey and the Romanesque Jak Abbey. The old 
village of Szentendre, now an art colony with galleries featuring the works of 
the sculptor Muhely and ceramacist Margit Kovacs, also is visited. 
</P>
<P>
Spas, popular recreational places, are spotlighted on Margit Island in the 
middle of the Danube and in the Thermal and Gellert hotels. Other spas are 
sited at the Tihany and the Thermal Hotel Aqua near Lake Balaton, the 
"Hungarian Riviera." 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian cuisine is displayed when the film tours Budapest's central market 
and visits the wine country of Hajos and Eger. 
</P>
<P>
Side trips include the great plain of Puszta, where cowboys display their 
horsemanship, and Syilvasvared, where the Lipizzaner horses, a legacy from 
Austrian rule, entertain. 
</P>
<P>
Folk art and the needlework centers at Kalocsa and Oregaserto, ancient Pecs and 
the Vasarely Museum, the Zsolnary Ceramic Museum and the Csontvary Museum of 
modern art are also included. At Kecsketmet, viewers tour the museum of Naive 
Artists and the Zoltan Kodaly music school. 
</P>
<P>
There's more music at the Budapest opera house, at a restaurant featuring Gypsy 
music and on a trip to the Eszterhausy Palace in Sopron, where Joseph Haydn 
produced many of his works. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the video is devoted to money, telecommunications, photography, customs 
regulations and other useful information. 
</P>
<P>
A handy booklet accompanies the video. It features a time index that helps to 
find scenes of interest, maps, a list of language essentials and a rundown of 
travel tips, including transportation, tipping, visas and where to get more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Although several hotels and restaurants are shown, there is no link to 
"commercial considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Fodor's Video Guides, Random House Inc., Order Entry 
Dept., 400 Hahn Road, Westminster, Md. 21157, (800) 733-3000. Price: $14.95.

Sherilyn Mentes' film, edited from its longer theater length, opens in Delphi, 
"the center of the universe," the ancient home of the Delphic Oracle and the 
site of the great temple of Apollo. As the tour gets underway, it's obvious 
that the video isn't limited only to mythology and historic sites. Mentes goes 
to some lesser-known places of interest and introduces their people, life 
styles and folklore. 
</P>
<P>
Two islands with contrasting styles are Corfu, packed with foreign tourists, 
and Zakinthos, where people live simply and the highlight is a visit with a 
family of raisin producers. 
</P>
<P>
The film follows the Gulf of Corinth to the town of Corinth and its ancient 
ruins. Elsewhere on the Peloponnese Peninsula, where the 20th Century seems to 
have barely touched, women are still weaving wool by hand and using streams to 
wash their clothes. Here, too, is the once-powerful city of Sparta, now a 
little farming town, and the ghost town of Mistras, once a Byzantine cultural 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Thessaly in central Greece is a farming and sheep-raising area where popular 
souvenirs are made, particularly flokatis (rugs, wall hangings). A goat 
shepherd and a family that makes their living making feta cheese are 
spotlighted, as is Meteora, with its cliff-hanging monasteries. 
</P>
<P>
Along the northern coastal area of the Aegean Sea, stops include the 
shipbuilding town of Kavala, Philippi with its beautiful Greek and Roman ruins, 
Thessaloniki and the nearby village of Langadhas, where a celebration shows 
participants dancing on hot coals. 
</P>
<P>
More traditional Greek dancing takes place in Athens, where viewers are shown 
the Acropolis, Parthenon, Plaka and Constitution Square. A city tour also shows 
busy streets, as well as fine residential districts where viewers are invited 
into the home of a sculptor and his poet wife. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Athens, the film passes through a number of beach resorts, including 
Cape Sounion, which has a magnificent view from the Temple of Poseidon. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you'll cruise through the Greek Islands with Mentes to Hydra, Mykonos, 
Delos and Rhodes, said to be the site of the Colossus, before reaching 
Santorini (Thera). Santorini can be toured only by climbing 600 steps or by 
mule back. Crete offers the ancient Minoan ruins at Knossis, plus Lassithi, the 
"Valley of Windmills."

</P>
<P>
Russ and Barbara Nichols' video provides the trip planner with an excellent 
guide to most of the major wineries and many of the smaller ones. Included is 
information on visiting hours and such amenities as picnic areas, restaurants 
and shops, plus a beginner's course on wine selection. There are interviews 
with some of the chefs, innkeepers and wine makers who host visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The video films numerous resorts, hotels, inns and B&amp;Bs, from luxury to 
modest, selected by the Nichols on merit, not commercial consideration. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such wineries as Christian Brothers, Italian Swiss Colony, 
Sebastiani and Burgess, the film visits places with historic appeal, including 
the Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, oldest in California (1857), and Mission San 
Francisco de Solona (no longer a winery), where the wine industry began in 
1824. 
</P>
<P>
Others with tourist appeal are Glen Ellen Winery near Jack London Historic Park 
in Glen Ellen; Spring Mountain Winery, the site of TV's "Falcon Crest," and 
Robert Mondavi Winery, which offers art exhibits and a jazz festival (both 
wineries in St. Helena); Pat Paulsen Vineyards at Asti, and the Smothers 
Brothers Winery and gift shop in Kenwood. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers enjoy views of the areas from a hot-air balloon and from a limousine to 
Bodega Bay. Activities other than wine-tasting include glider rides, horseback 
riding, golf, bicycling, fishing in the Russian River and mud bathing in the 
Calistoga hot springs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such natural attractions as the Old Faithful Geyser and the 
Petrified Forest near Calistoga, viewers can see many historic towns and some 
of the 19th-Century buildings that have been restored as shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the video is a pamphlet put out by the Redwood Empire Assn. that 
contains a list of wineries (including Napa and Sonoma valleys) with 
information on fees and reservations (if needed), a map and a list of companies 
offering tours.

'THE FREUD OF FICTION'?; 
</P>
<P>
DOSTOEVSKY THE AUTHOR AS PSYCHOANALYST BY LOUIS BREGER (NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
PRESS: $35; 295 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Holquist, Holquist, professor of comparative literature at Yale 
University, is the author of Dostoevsky and the Novel and studies on Mikhail 
Bakhtin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vicomte de Vogue, a 19th-Century popularizer of Russian literature in the 
West, wrote enthusiastically about Tolstoy and Turgenev but felt he had to warn 
non-Russian readers about Dostoevsky at the time "Crime and Punishment" and 
"The Idiot" were just being translated for the first time. Get ready, he 
counseled his French audience, here come the Scythians! 
</P>
<P>
De Vogue's unease was occasioned, of course, by the wildness of Dostoevsky's 
novels, that quality of excess that Max Beerbohm captured with only slight 
exaggeration when he ascribed to his parody of Dostoevsky a "burning faith in a 
personal devil, a frank delight in earthquakes and pestilences, and a belief 
that everyone but himself will be brought back to life in time to be frozen to 
death in the next glacial epoch." 
</P>
<P>
Such extremes have made the Russian novelist a favorite subject of 
psychoanalytically oriented critics. Nietzsche claimed Dostoevsky was the only 
psychologist from whom he ever learned anything, and it was in his 1928 essay 
on "Dostoevsky and Parricide" that Freud himself conceded that "before the 
problem of the creative artist, analysis must, alas, lay down its arms." 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, Freud went right on to analyze the Russian novelist 
nevertheless, arguing that Dostoevsky, as do all men, desired to kill his 
father; when the father was in fact murdered by his serfs, not only did 
Dostoevsky begin to experience epileptic attacks but found the great theme of 
his art, culminating in "The Brothers Karamazov." Freud is led to conclude that 
"it can scarcely be owing to chance that three of the masterpieces of the 
literature of all time -- the 'Oedipus Rex' of Sophocles, Shakespeare's 
'Hamlet' and Dostoevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov' -- should all deal with the 
same subject, parricide. In all three, moreover, the motive for the deed, 
sexual rivalry for a woman, is laid bare." 
</P>
<P>
From the point of view of a more rigorously defined literary criticism, Freud 
provides here an example of what is wrong with the majority of psychoanalytic 
readings of literary texts. As literary critic Peter Brooks, hardly an opponent 
of Freudian theory, has recently put it: "Psychoanalysis in literary study has 
over and over again mistaken the object of analysis, with the result that 
whatever insights it has produced tell us precious little about the structure 
and rhetoric of literary texts." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Breger, a practicing psychoanalyst and a professor of psychoanalytic 
studies at the California Institute of Technology, is aware of this problem, 
and in his new book on Dostoevsky seeks to get around it by reaccentuating the 
typical object of Freudian readings. In a gesture that might itself be read as 
Oedipal, Breger the psychotherapist rejects Freud's approach to literature, 
arguing that "too often, applications (of Freudian techniques) to literature 
have relied on particular psychoanalytic observations -- the Oedipus complex, 
the primal scene . . . " and in so doing, have impoverished the art that they 
seek to elucidate. Breger seeks to avoid such pitfalls by thinking of 
Dostoevsky "not as a 'patient' to be analyzed but as a fellow psychoanalyst, 
someone who, in the creation of his novels, carried out an exploration of 
himself and his fellow man." Breger's approach is to treat Dostoevsky as if he 
were a fellow psychoanalyst, "the Freud of fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Such a shift in emphasis does provide Breger with some new things to say about 
Dostoevsky, as opposed to the predictable results of classical psychoanalytic 
readings. Among these is the idea that Dostoevsky was indeed conflicted about 
his parents, but that by far the most important of these was his mother, and 
not, as Freud would have it, his father. 
</P>
<P>
The most basic drive in Dostoevsky's life, argues Breger, was the rage he felt 
as a child against his mother, an anger that grew out of his jealousy of the 
many siblings she bore who displaced him in her affections. Details from 
various biographies of Dostoevsky are used as evidence that he not only hated 
his mother but also pitied her, as her many pregnancies, her tyrannical husband 
and tuberculosis forced her to cough her life away when the novelist was only 
15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Such anger and compassion for his mother might account for Dostoevsky's complex 
rendering of women as saints and whores. But Breger is prepared to speculate 
further that the child Dostoevsky may have acted out his ambivalent feelings 
with his younger sisters in "games that expressed his need for physical-sexual 
contact and his anger." 
</P>
<P>
It is not merely what we know of Dostoevsky's life that leads Breger to such a 
conclusion, but his reading of details from the novels, especially the 
relationship between Raskolnikov and his sister, Dunia, in "Crime and 
Punishment" and the fascination with girls and childish women that 
characterizes Svidrigailov in the same novel, or Stavrogin in "The Possessed." 
</P>
<P>
Alternating between details from various biographies of Dostoevsky and episodes 
from the novels, Breger seeks to show that Dostoevsky was guilty of some of the 
transgressions that led early Russian critics to label him "a cruel talent." In 
this, Breger is not all that different from other psychoanalytically oriented 
critics of Dostoevsky. But he goes on to argue that the novelist was aware of 
these tendencies in himself and projected them into his fiction. In doing so, 
he not only rose above the limitations of his psychic life but created a world 
in which the insights he had learned from his own experience could be 
translated into the analysis of characters whose complexity would impel Freud 
himself to professional admiration. 
</P>
<P>
In making this argument, Breger pays a good deal of attention to details in the 
novels themselves, and has interesting things to say about some of them, 
particularly "Crime and Punishment." His interpretation of Raskolnikov's dream 
about a horse that is beaten to death (a projection of Dostoevsky's lust for, 
rage against and guilt about his mother) is one of the more convincing that I 
have read. In general, Breger is especially good at bringing out subtle nuances 
in the role played by women characters in the novels. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest claim that the book makes is for its novelty among Freudian 
treatments of literature, Breger's treatment of Dostoevsky as if he were a 
psychoanalyst and the novels a complex form of case history. It is this 
approach that Breger hopes will exempt his study from charges usually leveled 
at Freudian criticism. So we are justified in asking, Does the approach work? 
</P>
<P>
I believe it does not. First of all because there is really nothing 
theoretically very powerful about such an assumption, which in the end amounts 
to no more than claiming that Dostoevsky was able to gain unusual acuity in 
delineating character through projection of his own psychological struggles. 
</P>
<P>
This is at best a truism, and one far from new. Strakhov, Dostoevsky's first 
biographer, made much the same claim, if very crudely, and Gide's study of the 
Russian novelist makes the point with more useful application to an 
understanding of Dostoevsky's art. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Breger fails to avoid the charge of reductionism. The book is 
filled with statements such as: "From what is known clinically, about such 
patterns, and from what we see in the novel, the following hypothesis suggests 
itself . . . ", or "Studies of such situations show that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative effect is to turn Dostoevsky's complex narrative experiments 
into illustrations of "what is known clinically."

THE POET LAUREATE OF FAILURE; 
</P>
<P>
COLERIDGE EARLY VISIONS BY RICHARD HOLMES (VIKING: $19.95; 409 PP., 
ILLUSTRATED; 0-670-804444-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Catherine Miles Wallace, Wallace, author of The Design of 'Biographia 
Literaria' (George Allen &amp; Unwin), is visiting associate professor of 
English at Mundelein College, Chicago. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading Richard Holmes' award-winning biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge felt 
something like meeting face-to-face a person with whom I have worked 
long-distance for years. Here he is, with all of his faults and all of his wit, 
all of his astounding intellectual power, and above all with his richly 
engaging personality: Coleridge -- the great Romantic poet and literary critic, 
the theologian, the political theorist. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes plays his hand openly: He has written a courageous and tough-minded 
book. As he points out, "No biographer, since James Dyke Campbell in 1894, has 
tried to examine (Coleridge's) entire life in a broad and sympathetic manner, 
and to ask the one vital question: What made Coleridge -- for all his 
extravagant panoply of faults -- such an extraordinary man, such an 
extraordinary mind? The most radical thing about the present book -- the first 
of two volumes -- is simply that it is a defence of Coleridge in these terms." 
</P>
<P>
Offhand, that may not seem so radical, but in our times as in his own, 
Coleridge has provoked both hyperbolic praise and bitter condemnation. In this 
context, Holmes' work is indeed radical because he does not blink at 
Coleridge's faults, and yet he values both Coleridge's character and his 
achievements fairly. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Holmes has had to bridge gulfs of several sorts. Because Coleridge's 
interests and achievements were so broad, "Coleridgeans" easily divide into 
hostile camps: the literary theorists, the critics, the epistemologists, the 
theologians, the political theorists. Coleridge's personal life also invites 
sharply divided opinion: Lies, debts, drugs, plagiarism must be balanced 
against wit, generosity, genius and suffering. Given this situation, 
intelligent moderation can be a daring act -- and one that also requires 
considerable scholarship. I came away warmly impressed both with Holmes' 
personal integrity and with his scholarly judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' balanced yet sympathetic portrait rests upon a consistent narrative 
unity. He does not use biography as an excuse to string together analyses of 
major works. Nor is he trying to psychoanalyze Coleridge. I particularly 
admired the balance and insight of his accounts of Coleridge's early 
experiences because the primary documentary evidence often is so contradictory. 
For instance, all his life Coleridge elicited extravagant praise; in 
particular, he made an incredible first impression on others. Too often, this 
exaggerated praise collapsed into an equally exaggerated censure. Coleridge's 
discerning empathy, his verbal wit, his capacity for self-parody and, above 
all, his prodigious intelligence ought to have impressed anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Coleridge was always eager for approval; he was centrally, agonizingly 
insecure -- a pair of problems that he himself linked to the early death of his 
fond, approving father and to his mother's remarkable coldness. Having elicited 
the attention and approval he needed, Coleridge then had to cope with meeting 
expectations that would have intimidated far more confident men. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes maps out this pattern in well-documented detail but never uses depth 
psychology to explain it away. Instead, he uses the pattern to generate a 
lively dramatic tension: How talented is this chap anyhow? Will he make 
anything of himself? And if so, what? Is he going to make it as a poet? Or 
should he stick with the political journalism that has been so well-received? 
And is this German stuff yet another escape, or will it lead to something? 
</P>
<P>
The only personal or dramatic balance that Holmes misses, it seems to me, 
concerns Coleridge's opium use. Although duly noting Coleridge's arthritis and 
his recurrent bouts with rheumatic fever (in which severe joint pain is the 
most prominent symptom), Holmes at first seems to dismiss Coleridge's 
subsequent malaise in damp winter weather as some version of Seasonal Affective 
Disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes does not point out that Coleridge's pattern of opium use more nearly 
matches that found in people who take narcotics for legitimate reasons: When 
his symptoms subsided with warmer and dryer weather, he could decrease his dose 
with far fewer consequences than true addicts experience. Especially when 
rheumatic valve damage turned to congestive heart failure, Coleridge's mix of 
physical and psychological motives for taking opium became extraordinarily 
complex: the use of the word addict oversimplifies. Holmes does not explore 
these motives with the subtlety that I admire at other points in this book. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Holmes is bold and discerning in his portrait of Coleridge's work, 
including the plagiarism problem. In the disappointments of 1799, Holmes can 
"glimpse something new stirring in that extraordinarily flexible and 
resourceful mind: the hope of creating himself imaginatively out of the sense 
of failure itself." He contends that, for Coleridge, "the subject of failure, 
of lost imaginative power, could itself produce great poetry, vividly imagined 
and metaphysically argued." 
</P>
<P>
This very central argument probably will have a parallel in the next volume of 
this two-volume biography: that the failure of Coleridge's formal philosophic 
ambitions itself produced a philosophic theology and a literary criticism of 
extraordinary power and influence. Holmes' argument about Coleridge's 
significance is radical because Coleridge has been damned for his "inability" 
to propose an old-fashioned, closed, strictly logical philosophical system. Or, 
just as obtusely, Coleridge's philosophic and theological work has been written 
off as a disaster that smothered a fine poet. Holmes adeptly transcends these 
usual categories. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' work thus complements the massive re-evaluation that has slowly been 
built upon new or modern editions of Coleridge's writings -- especially the 
"Notebooks." This biography promises to integrate Coleridge's career as nothing 
else ever has, and thus to provide one basis for interrelating Coleridge's work 
in diverse disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleridge: Early Visions" will prove widely influential because Holmes' 
portrait is so accurate, so fully imagined, so wonderfully engaging in its own 
right. I'm ordering copies of this volume as gifts for friends who have heard 
me tell Coleridge stories for 20 years. Here: Someone for you to meet.

RICHARD EDER: E PLURIBUS ENGLAND; 
</P>
<P>
THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA BY HANIF KUREISHI (VIKING: $18.95; 283 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Eder 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My name is Karim Amir, and I am an Englishman born and bred, almost." 
</P>
<P>
It is a start worthy of Dickens; one of those bagpipe sentences whose skirl 
heralds the book to come, and whose bumpy drone nourishes it as it goes along. 
"The Buddha of Suburbia" is London subverted -- notice that "almost" -- by 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
There is London as idea: St. Paul's, sweet Thames, the Changing of the Guard, 
the National Theater, helmeted bobbies, bowler hats, bespoke tailoring, Big 
Ben, Bow bells, Pearly Queens and the lot. And there is London of those who 
came, in one way or another, because of the first London; and who put a mosque 
at Regents Park; kohl, dall, funny smells and funny accents in Southall; and 
Caribbean markets and unemployed anger in Brixton. 
</P>
<P>
Hanif Kureishi, author of the film "My Beautiful Laundrette," again shows us 
England and her Third World, this time in a novel. He writes of Indian 
shopkeepers, punk groupies with spiked green hair, grandmothers in saris and 
their granddaughters hooked on Germaine Greer, soccer hoodlums, lords' sons in 
Italian shoes and no socks, and avant-garde art snobs with private incomes. He 
weaves together a London that is terminally fragmented; he writes about 
traditional Londoners and the people they take account of only when they take 
the wrong bus. 
</P>
<P>
The weaving is done through the wonderfully observant and comically desperate 
voice of Karim, son of an Indian father and an Anglo mother. They live in a 
dingy south London suburb and float between worlds. But it is Kureishi's point 
that the worlds themselves are floating. 
</P>
<P>
Dad, as Karim calls him, is a minor government employee, and miserable at it. 
But it is not his real life. He is a flowery Bombay cock-of-the-walk: warm, 
impulsive and flirtatious. When Karim was 3 and 4, Dad would take him to 
tearooms and dispatch him to ladies at nearby tables with the message: "My 
daddy wants to give you a kiss." Later, he draws on his heritage to practice 
yoga and give courses in Eastern mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
Dad is a big hit with the local middle class, particularly with Eva, who is 
brassy, arty and shrewd, and steals Dad from his family. Karim is torn. He goes 
with his father to Eva's seances in turquoise flared trousers, see-through 
shirt, scarlet vest with gold stitching, high-heeled blue boots and a headband 
-- a mixture of Indian and hip -- but he weeps at the news that Dad is leaving. 
Dad weeps too, and covers him with kisses. The weeping and kissing are done in 
public; tropical disturbances at a south London bus stop. Dad is trying to go 
to Eva's; he has to ask Karim for the right bus. 
</P>
<P>
Karim knows all the buses. He is solidly in with the matted-hair rock 'n' roll 
set at his school; he listens to pop stars on his radio, and he has the right 
moves. But he floats too. He is bisexual -- in a novel about blurred identity, 
even sex is blurred -- and makes love both to Charlie, Eva's beautiful, 
rock-musician son, and to Helen, whose father has a hairy back and hates 
"blacks." 
</P>
<P>
He also makes regular love with Jamila, his best friend. She has done drugs and 
sex since puberty; she is utterly liberated and politically aware; her idols 
are Greer, Malcolm X and Kate Millett. But her father, Anwar, is on a hunger 
strike because she refuses to marry a husband whom his family in Bombay has 
picked out for her. 
</P>
<P>
Floating worlds. The Indians are trying to cope with being English. The English 
have lost any real identity of their own. Dad, the suburban Buddha, is a big 
hit; he even converts Karim's chauvinist Uncle Ted, whose hobby is football 
rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Eva will move to central London and get in with the art crowd. She will take 
Dad with her; his guru work will go out of demand, but he will remain as 
cheerfully full of himself as ever. Jamila will marry Changez, her bespoke 
husband, but she will not sleep with him. 
</P>
<P>
Karim will get a theater job playing Mowgli in "The Jungle Book." He will move 
up to a fashionable avant-garde group, working up a character based on his 
Indian relatives. It will feel like exploitation, but it will lead to a 
high-paying TV job; and by that time, having been exploited, sexually and 
otherwise, by his up-market English associates, he won't much care. 
</P>
<P>
Kureishi's story turns thin and cartoonish in its later sections, when Karim is 
dealing head-on with the snobby London set. Other English writers, from Waugh 
on, have told us everything possible about its hollowness and decay. Kureishi's 
pages on the decadent New York entertainment scene -- Charlie has become a 
punk-rock star -- are equally thin and brittle. But the portrait of Karim's 
inner struggle, and that of his family and friends, is richly comic and quite a 
bit more. 
</P>
<P>
There is Changez, for example, Jamila's imported husband. We first see him as 
"the man walking towards England." He is a one-man foreign country right in the 
middle of Heathrow Airport: tubby, bald, carrying two rotting suitcases and 
full of illusions about a fine marriage and a fine English future. They will be 
punctured, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
Changez is hopeless at working; he falls asleep in his father-in-law's store. 
Jamila treats him with the utmost severity, making him sleep on the couch while 
she sits in the bedroom doing her political studies. Eventually she moves them 
both to a commune, where she takes lovers of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Changez yearns continually, but with immense dignity. With one deformed arm and 
no looks, he is lordly nonetheless. He is a god exiled into hard times, but he 
never doubts himself. And he delivers a splendid speech of outrage in Jamila's 
anarchist, vegetarian, free-love (but not for him) commune: 
</P>
<P>
"All you here in this house, you good types, talk of the prejudice against this 
Yid and that black burglar bastard, this Paki and that poor woman. . . . But 
what about ugly bastards? What about us? What about our rights to be kissed?" 
</P>
<P>
In his account of his countrymen making their way in England, Kureishi tells us 
more about England, perhaps, than he does when he attempts a direct portrait. 
It is in the lovely deflections of his highly colored, life-asserting Indians 
that we see the social hollows and pallors of their hosts. Karim's south London 
schoolmates, and the aimless husbands and wives who flock to Dad's Buddha 
sessions, are as floating and unplaced in Thatcherite England as the immigrants 
are. 
</P>
<P>
In an odd way, "The Buddha of Suburbia" is a counterpart to Tom Wolfe's 
"Bonfire of the Vanities." Both books show the Western city pressed upon by a 
non-white Third World. Wolfe's book, clever but cold, shows us simply what it 
is like to be pressed. Kureishi's witty and exhilarating novel -- despite its 
awkward and disappointing second half -- shows us what it is like to be that 
Third World. 
</P>
<P>
We see the people in the streets, subways and little shops from whom we tend to 
avert our eyes, or at least our sympathy. In averting them, we become less 
visible to ourselves. We could use a few Kureishis over here.

LOVING LAWRENCE, HATING ARABIA; 
</P>
<P>
DREAMING OF SAMARKAND BY MARTIN BOOTH (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 333 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lamb, Lamb, a Times national correspondent, is the author of The 
Arabs: Journeys Beyond the Mirage. His latest book, on minor-league baseball, 
will be published next spring. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I may be admitting to an intellectual shortcoming, but even after living in the 
Middle East for four years, my image of Lawrence of Arabia was supplied 
primarily by Hollywood. Mention his name and what came to mind was Peter 
O'Toole and thundering horsemen and stunning desert vistas. 
</P>
<P>
T. E. Lawrence was, to be sure, one of the epic Western figures to emerge from 
colonial Arabia, though after reading Martin Booth's fine novel, "Dreaming of 
Samarkand," one is struck by the fact that Lawrence, and the European 
spymasters with whom he was entangled, were not altering history; they were 
only delaying it. 
</P>
<P>
Booth's novel is a dramatic treatment of a real and fascinating moment in the 
Middle East -- the days prior to World War I when the British, French, Germans, 
Italians and Turks were double-dealing each other to stake their claims on the 
future of the Levant. Only Lawrence saw the Arabs as anything more than pawns 
to be manipulated by distant European capitals. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dreaming of Samarkand," in the final days of 1911, an obscure British poet, 
James Elroy Flecker, is struggling along in his dreary job at the British 
Consulate in Beirut. He is sickly, indebted, desperate for literary acclaim and 
miserable in an Arab world he detests. If Lawrence is the legend, infatuated 
with the mysteries of the Middle East, Flecker is the tragic misfit, longing 
for the drizzle of England and the fog of the Cotswolds. 
</P>
<P>
"People speak of the East being the birthplace of civilization, but where is 
it?" Flecker says to his wife, Helle: "In ruins, misruled by usurping and 
greedy Europeans. The only real civilization today lies in the grubby back 
streets around the factories of England. They are the people who are in touch 
with life, not existing from one oasis to the next, nomads with no compass. 
They know where they are going." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence is working on an archeological dig in Syria during the winter of 
Flecker's discontent, and also keeping an eye on a railway that the Germans 
were building from Berlin to Baghdad. Flecker, the most unlikely of spies, is 
recruited by British intelligence to assist Lawrence. In doing so, he is drawn 
inescapably into the web of Middle East intrigue and finds himself caught in 
the grip of Lawrence's spell-binding charms and intellect. 
</P>
<P>
"You are in love with him, I know this," shouts Helle one day. Flecker cannot 
deny it, and until his death in Switzerland three years later -- a death hardly 
noticed in literary circles -- he is to love both Helle and the desert 
adventurer, who travels with an Arab boy, Dahoum. Rebuffed by Lawrence when he 
makes a advance, Flecker asks why, then, Lawrence embraces Dahoum. "That's 
different; I've told you that," Lawrence replies. "I want not only him, but his 
whole world. His villages and ruins, the castles of the Crusaders, the dunes of 
the desert, the hot sun. . . . You do understand?" "I think so," Flecker 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry is to Flecker what the desert is to Lawrence, the ray of life itself. As 
different as the two men are, their friendship unfolds as a grand adventure of 
diplomatic scheming and European rivalry that ranges through Lebanon and Syria 
to a Turkish jail where Flecker must match wits with the captors of Lawrence 
and Dahoum. 
</P>
<P>
Flecker's life as a gunrunner and spy bring moments of exhilaration, but as his 
bronchitis worsens, as his poems are rejected by London publishers, he falls 
deeper into depression, disillusioned with himself and the world. Even 
Lawrence, he eventually realizes, is but the tool of the power hunters for whom 
intelligence work is a game. 
</P>
<P>
The characters of whom Booth writes have the glow of authenticity, and their 
story is a skillful blend of history and fiction. The reader is left with the 
realization that the foundation of the Middle East's problems today -- the 
turmoil in Lebanon, the conflict between Arab and Jew, the jockeying for 
influence between superpowers -- was laid by European architects in the time of 
Lawrence and Flecker. The Middle East is a giant trap from which even Lawrence 
could not escape. Nor can Flecker, even though he finally leaves Lebanon, with 
his wife, to seek refuge in a series of Swiss sanatoriums. 
</P>
<P>
Feverish and weakened, Flecker is haunted by his longing for Lawrence. The 
poems he writes are the finest of his life; his days, if not happy, are at 
least free of a doomed relationship and the "cruel climate with its cruel 
people and their savage history" that, in the end, shape the softness of his 
words.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: EASING THE ACHE GAY MEN RECOVERING FROM COMPULSIVE 
BEHAVIORS BY DAVID CRAWFORD (E. P. DUTTON: $18.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Crawford (a pseudonym, as are all the names in this slim, anguished work) 
sits at the intersection of his homosexuality and his alcoholism, and writes 
specifically for gay men who fight compulsive behaviors, from too much drink 
to, in this era of AIDS, too much careless sex. He began fighting his addiction 
to liquor in the traditional Twelve Steps program of Alcoholics Anonymous, and, 
while he was successful, he came to realize that gay men often felt constrained 
in heterosexual AA groups. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's book is an effort to translate what he learned into a gay vernacular 
in hopes of reaching readers who felt they couldn't tell the truth in AA, or 
who found, like Crawford, that they were reluctant even to identify the sex of 
the person they lived with. Sadly, much of what he writes is in the 
misery-loves-company/true-confessions vein. He can paint a vivid scene and 
describe in painful detail the various dents to one's self-esteem that lead to 
addictive behavior, as well as the difficult crawl back up. But his advice is 
terribly dilute by comparison, full of therapeutic platitudes. Although his 
experience and his desire to heal seem genuine, what he offers -- his talk of 
spiritual victory -- does not seem enough to sustain a beaten soul. Would that 
it could -- but even his description of his brother's death from AIDS, and what 
he learned about the process of "softening and severing" ties, seems a helping 
hand held just out of reach.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: LITTLE LEAGUE'S OFFICIAL HOW-TO-PLAY BASEBALL BOOK BY PETER 
KREUTZER AND TED KERLEY (DOUBLEDAY: $19.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, which means I know a great deal more about 
blind faith than I do about baseball. I certainly can't be accused of having an 
oversupply of common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this seems a smart book -- a guide to Little League designed for the 
folks who play it: (still mostly) boys between the ages of 8 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Kreutzer and Kerley, respectively a screenwriter of children's programming and 
the educator author of a book for Little League managers and coaches, guide the 
player through every aspect of the game, explaining all the rules, the role of 
each individual position, and situational strategies. 
</P>
<P>
In this era of pre-adolescent sports prodigies and stage parents, the authors 
take a pleasantly low-key approach: A page entitled "How NOT to Look Like a 
Baseball Player" encourages both respect for the game and enjoyment of it, even 
if you do strike out. By speaking directly to the young player, the authors 
give him some ammunition in the parent/coach/kid equation -- a nice nod, given 
that he's supposed to be the beneficiary of a system that could, and sometimes 
does, overpower him. 
</P>
<P>
There are quizzes throughout the book to help the reader gauge his own 
progress, as well as diagrams and drawings. "The Little League's Official 
How-to-Play Baseball Book" represents a daunting optimism in that it is an 
expanded version of a very popular videotape; its very existence implies a 
belief that somewhere in this country there are a few boys left who would 
rather read than watch a color monitor.

'LIBRARY SWEATSHOP' PRO AND CON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Library Sweatshop: A View From the Bottom" (Endpapers by Ron Kelley, May 20) 
touched me in an uncommon way. It is more than distressing to read such an 
eloquently angry diatribe against the necessary albeit routine duties performed 
by library staff; it is a dagger in the heart to those of us who value the 
intrinsic purpose of libraries and who are willing to spend our lives proving 
our dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Problems involving morale in a rapidly changing technological profession are 
not the fault of the institution or the institution's administration; these 
problems are an indication that not all technological advances are compatible 
with human physiology. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that Mr. Kelley stop psychoanalyzing library work-flow charts and 
begin to use his fine rhetorical skills to help people and computer screens 
come together more easily in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
The object of a minor cult following, "Hindoo Holiday" is a memoir of the 
months J.R. Ackerly spent as secretary/confidant to the morose, homosexual 
maharajah of the Indian state he calls Chhokrapur. A brooding, lonely man, the 
"Maharajah Sahib" looked beyond his country for a sympathetic listener and 
found a understanding companion in Ackerly. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the two of them languidly sighing over handsome young men may have 
been considered scandalous in 1932, but it seems almost comically tame 60 years 
later. The more interesting sections of the book offer vignettes of the last 
days of the crumbling British Raj: An imperious woman dismisses a native 
servant for daring to touch her -- even though his breach of etiquette 
prevented her from being bitten a venomous serpent. A curious souvenir of a 
vanished world.

Re-warmed brat pack Angst. Ennui, drugs and alienation abound in yet another 
chronicle of life among the well-to-do but loveless kids of the Eastern 
Seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Smith's pedestrian novel takes the form of an internal monologue -- a 
polluted stream of consciousness that is too derivative to be interesting, but 
not quite terrible enough to be funny. The scene in which the narrator shaves 
his younger sister's head and his older brother's crotch may cause readers to 
wonder why a reviewer for the Chicago Tribune described Smith as a "younger, 
hipper Robert Benchley" -- and why as classy a publisher as Atlantic Monthly 
bothered with this shopworn trash.

Intended for ages 12 and up, this attractive, large-format book makes a handy 
addition to the library of an adult amateur scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The more useful chapters include a catalogue of dinosaur exhibits in museums 
around the world and an alphabetical list of dinosaur genera. The sections 
devoted to various aspects of life during the Mesozoic Era are more readable, 
but David Lambert tends to present largely unproveable theories about dinosaur 
behavior as fact. Male Pachycephalosaurs may have butted their thickly domed 
heads in fights over females, but it is by no means certain that they did. A 
useful book, but one to be taken with a grain of rock salt.

IT LOOKS EASY FOR SOCKERS 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year about playoff time, Brian Quinn has people come up to him and say 
things such as: "This is when you guys always play well and win championships." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, a Socker midfielder, would like it to be known that it's not as easy as 
it sounds. Sure, the Sockers have won seven of the past eight indoor soccer 
titles, but he doesn't like it when people act as if it's served to the Sockers 
on Thanksgiving china. 
</P>
<P>
He gives a very simple explanation for their recent success. 
</P>
<P>
"Just playing well," he said. "That's the bottom line. We're playing better. 
That was our best all-around performance." 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, the Sockers made it look so easy in a 5-2 victory over the 
Baltimore Blast in Game 3 of the MISL championship series Saturday that Quinn 
is going to have more trouble than ever convincing anybody that this isn't 
mystique or magic. The victory was witnessed by an MISL playoff-high 11,014 in 
the San Diego Sports Arena and it gave the Sockers a 2-1 lead in the 
best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Their best game of the season? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "I think we've played better than 
that. I thought we played well, but there were spells when we didn't look so 
good." 
</P>
<P>
In many games, the Sockers have made it entertaining by taking a lead, losing 
it and then coming up with a late goal to pull it out. Or not. 
</P>
<P>
This one was essentially over at halftime, when the Sockers held a 4-0 lead 
because of four well-executed goals and a lot of hard work up and down the 
field. There were no cheap bounces. 
</P>
<P>
It all started midway through the first quarter when the Sockers went on a 
power play after Blast midfiedler Billy Ronson was called for tripping. Forward 
Paul Wright made on a nice fake in front of the left boards and sent a pass 
back to midfielder Branko Segota, who sent it in off the leg of goalie Scott 
Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 1:42 remaining in the first, forward Jim Gabarra sent a soft pass 
into the middle to forward Wes Wade, who banged it quickly into the left corner 
to give the Socker a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With one second remaining in the quarter, Segota gave the fans a replica of the 
goal he scored Thursday in Baltimore, standing on the ball for a second before 
pushing it to his right, spinning around forward Mark Mettrick and lining it 
into the left corner. Midfielder Waad Hirmez gave Segota the ball, sending a 
pass through the legs of defender Mike Stankovic. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this was further evidence that Segota has pulled himself out of his 
slump and, maybe, that he doesn't care too much about the regular season. It 
took longer this year than in previous years, but Segota is finally playing 
playoff soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling much better," he said. "I'm starting to enjoy the game again. For 
a while there, I was miserable, and I didn't feel like talking to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Wright did his talking before the game, saying essentially that the only way 
Baltimore could stop him was with fouls. He backed his words, picking up two 
assists, the second of which came in in the second quarter. He scorched down 
the sidelines past Ronson, who did his best to grab him on the way, and passed 
into the goal mouth to midfielder Ben Collins, who touched it in. 
</P>
<P>
Wright didn't make any retractions afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take anything back," he said. "They know who I am and I know 
who they are. (The fouls) are to be expected. That's the only chance they have 
of stopping me." 
</P>
<P>
Blast Coach Kenny Cooper would like his team to forget Wright's comments and 
worry more about the Sockers. He told them so in his post-game speach. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a young guy," Cooper said. "He's entitled to say what he wants. You don't 
put a muzzle on people." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Rod Castro ended the Sockers' scoring late in the third quarter, taking 
a pass from Hirmez and sending it past Manning, who charged out and tried to 
make a foot save. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast got two fourth-quarter goals from forward Domenic Mobilio and 
Mettrick. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
With victories in the next two games, the Sockers would win this series at 
home, something they couldn't manage last season when they took a 3-1 series 
lead into the final game in San Diego and lost. What are the chances? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get too cocky," defender George Fernandez said. "If we keep on 
playing the way we're playing right now, we could do it. It's going to be 
tough. They're not going to give it to us." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper will attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be over here," he said. "Oh, no, no, no. We're going to win 
a game. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Blast, nothing was simple on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore defender Mike Reynolds did not play Saturday because of a right ankle 
sprain he suffered in the first quarter of Game 2. . . . Socker Coach Ron 
Newman opted to stick with his goalie rotation, starting Victor Nogueira over 
Zoltan Toth, who was superb in Game 2. Newman said Toth had a stiff neck in 
practice Saturday but will be the starter in Game 4. . . . Baltimore goalie 
Scott Manning has started eight of the Blast's nine playoff games. Since Billy 
Ronson was in as a sixth attacker with the score tied in Game 2, Manning wasn't 
credited with the loss.

PADRES, WHITSON WIN BIG

<P>
The way Ed Whitson figures it, it's simple. 
</P>
<P>
The other team gets paid well to hit the white rat. He gets paid to not let 
them hit the white rat. 
</P>
<P>
"As I call it," Whitson says. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. How you can come up with "white rat" for a baseball isn't easy to figure, 
but then again, after you pitch a game like Whitson did Saturday, not many 
folks are going to question you. So leave him alone. Let him ice his arm. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres got plenty of good pitching from Whitson, plenty of good hitting 
from just about everyone in their lineup and eased to a 9-0 victory over the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves got none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
This came before 53,701 on Sports Bag night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
It was the eighth-largest crowd in team history and the second-largest this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Padres alone into second place, one game ahead of the 
Dodgers. Of course, the Padres are still nine games behind the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
They have won seven of their past nine games, and what a contrast the past two 
nights have been. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Padres make six errors, give up three home runs and 16 runs. 
They get 11 runs and still lose. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, everything falls into place for them. They get a bagful of runs, 14 
hits and make no errors. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two nights, the Padres have punched in with 20 runs on 31 hits. 
</P>
<P>
And they are 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of Friday quickly faded with a few glances at the way Whitson (5-3) 
was throwing the white rat around Saturday. He was in control all night, 
scattering five hits and never allowing a Brave beyond second base. His control 
couldn't have been much better. He walked just one batter, and of 109 pitches, 
81 were strikes and 28 were balls. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't fool around," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "He throws strikes. 
He had great stuff. An excellent breaking ball, good change, and a good 
fastball." 
</P>
<P>
It all added up to Whitson's second shutout this season and the 11th of his 
12-year career. It was also his fourth complete game this season, which ties 
him with Los Angeles' Mike Morgan for the NL lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was working," Whitson said. "I was getting ahead in the count, 
keeping the ball down in the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt real good in the bullpen. I felt like I had it." 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing is, it was his first career complete game against Atlanta. He was 
1-2 against the Braves last year, and 6-11 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, though, Whitson could have given up a few runs and still had 
plenty to spare. Except for Joe Carter and Jerald Clark, all of the Padre 
starters -- including Whitson -- had at least one hit. And Carter, although oh 
for two, drove in two runs with sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
The first three in the Padre order -- Bip Roberts, Roberto Alomar and Tony 
Gwynn -- reached base a total of 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes a difference," McKeon said. "When we were on our hot streak last 
year from August on, those guys were keys. They make something happen, and give 
the big guys a chance to knock them in." 
</P>
<P>
Alomar was the biggest instigator. He went three for four, and it was his 
two-run homer in the first that got the Padres started. It came after Roberts 
had singled, and it was his first home run in 171 at bats. It was his second of 
the season, and first since April 12. 
</P>
<P>
By evening's end, he improved his batting average to .332 and became the 20th 
Padre to score four runs in a game. Benito Santiago did it Friday. Alomar also 
walked once. 
</P>
<P>
But Alomar didn't hog the offensive spotlight: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roberts went two for five, extending his career-best hitting streak to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gwynn went three for four with two doubles and three runs-batted in. His 
average is now up to .337. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shawn Abner went two for four. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Derek Lilliquist came into the game 2-6 with a 4.83 earned-run 
average, but it was apparent early that he wasn't going to be improving those 
numbers. He left after just 3 1/3 innings, having allowed eight runs, nine hits 
and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't fool the Padres at all. After giving up Alomar's homer in the first, 
he walked two Padres -- Gwynn and Benito Santiago, but was able to get out of 
it by getting ground balls from Carter and Clark. Carter's forced Gwynn at 
second, and Clark's was turned into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
But two innings later, the Padres made it 4-0. Alomar singled and scored on 
Carter's sacrifice fly to left, and Gwynn singled and scored on Santiago's 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to some aggressive base-running, Santiago moved all the way to third 
before the inning ended, but stayed there. He took second after his single when 
Atlanta left fielder Ron Gant threw home in an attempt to get Gwynn. Then he 
stole third -- his first stolen base of the season. But Clark struck out and 
left him there. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres added four more in the fourth, sending Lilliquist to an early 
shower. In succession, Templeton doubled, Whitson and Roberts singled, Alomar 
walked and Gwynn doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson got a run-batted in when Garry Templeton scored on his single, and 
Gwynn, the first batter to face reliever Dwayne Henry, knocked in three runs 
with his double off the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made it 9-0 in the sixth against Marty Clary. Alomar led off with a 
single and later scored on Carter's fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Injury Report: Third baseman Mike Pagliarulo didn't start Saturday and probably 
will not play today, and first baseman Jack Clark may return to the lineup 
sometime next week. Pagliarulo strained his left hamstring Thursday, and his 
status has been day-to-day. Padre Manager Jack McKeon said he is planning to 
give Pagliarulo the day off today. "I want him right," McKeon said. "I don't 
want him to get hurt." Another reason is that Atlanta is starting left-hander 
Charlie Leibrandt. As for Clark, out with an injured back and fractured 
cheekbone, he said Friday that he hopes to return by the end of the current 
home stand. It doesn't end until June 14, but McKeon said Saturday he hopes 
Clark will be back next week. . . . Coach Greg Riddoch returned to the first 
base coach's box and batting coach Amos Otis went back to the dugout Saturday. 
. . . Bip Roberts made three errors in Friday's 16-11 loss and tipped his hat 
to the crowd after making a play to end the seventh. He said the cap-tipping 
was spontaneous. "I was just happy to make the play," he said, smiling. He took 
some ribbing after the game for the three errors. "They said, 'You may as well 
have made four or five, so people remember you,' " Roberts said. "Jack (McKeon) 
told me that, Joe Carter told me that . . . " . . . Jim Marshall, former major 
league player and manager, was at the stadium with three visitors from Japan -- 
two employees of the Orix Braves of the Japanese League and an interpreter. 
Tsutomu Matsuzaki, the director of marketing and promotions, and Shinya 
Kobayashi, an Orix outfielder for 13 years, are touring several facilities in 
the United States and Canada. It was just a coincidence that they arrived in 
San Diego for Sports Bag Night. "(Matsuzaki's) first question was, 'How many 
bags do you give away?' " Marshall said. "When they told him everybody gets 
one, he was surprised. He figured they gave them to the first 20,000 or 30,000. 
He thought that was great." Marshall, who played for six teams and managed the 
Cubs and A's in the 1970s, is acting as chaperon. They have already been to 
some minor league parks in Arizona, Dodger Stadium and Anaheim Stadium. Next 
stop is Toronto, followed by New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City and 
San Francisco. They are midway through a month-long tour. . . . Joe Black, 
former Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds pitcher, was also at the stadium. 
Black is now a special consultant to Commissioner Fay Vincent, and he spoke to 
the Padres before the game about life after baseball. San Diego was the 26th 
and final stop on Black's tour. He said he covers three basic areas: money 
management, education and work. He said the late Bart Giamatti and Vincent 
started working on the program shortly after former California pitcher Donnie 
Moore committed suicide last year. . . . The three home runs allowed by Padre 
pitchers Friday increased the team's total to 57 allowed for the season, which 
leads the league by a comfortable -- or uncomfortable -- margin. Second is 
Atlanta, with 46. . . . Pitching matchups for the three-game series with 
Houston beginning Monday: The Padres' Andy Benes (5-4) vs. Jim Clancy (1-4) 
Monday; Dennis Rasmussen (5-2) vs. Jim Deshaies (3-2) Tuesday, and Mike Dunne 
(0-2) vs. Mark Portugal (1-5) Wednesday. Tuesday's game has been moved to 7:35 
p.m. for ESPN.

TIME HAS COME FOR METS TO TURN THE PAGE ON 1986 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
By now, we all have heard -- ad nauseum -- how few rules Davey Johnson 
established during his tenure as Mets manager and how little he enforced the 
ones he did have. Discipline has its place, but neither Bill James nor Dallas 
Green has found direct correlations between a game of hearts and ERA and 
between afternoon success on the 16th hole and ninth-inning failure to hit. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson did have one directive that he regularly enforced and emphasized. It 
was neither profound nor his own creation. It was simply "Turn the page." He 
would advise his players to do so, knowing that selective recall can do wonders 
for a player's psyche. Forget yesterday's failure, clear your mind, dump your 
burdens. 
</P>
<P>
Now, because Frank Cashen lacks the patience he says he has and because he 
undermined Johnson eight months before he dismissed him, the Mets' players must 
turn the final page of the most successful chapter in the history of the 
franchise. The next few weeks will produce an epilogue, no doubt, but the book 
on Davey Johnson as Mets manager essentially is closed. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Mets must forget him and the strain of the last 204 games of his 
regime. In doing so, they are all but forced to purge Johnson's greatest 
achievement from their memories. And that's a good thing. The time has come for 
them to turn the page on The 1986 Season and all the wonder and spectacle it 
created. Johnson's dismissal ought to enable the Mets to accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
His departure leaves only remnants from that season in the clubhouse. Now that 
Johnson is collecting more than $750,000 over the next 1 1/3 seasons to fish in 
Florida, nearly all of the primary people involved in that wondrous season are 
gone. Think about it. Hernandez, Carter, Knight, Backman, Dykstra, Wilson, 
Mitchell, Orosco, McDowell and Santana are gone. And now Johnson is, too. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, most of the starting rotation from that season remains intact, and, of 
course, Darryl Strawberry still draws his salary from Sterling Doubleday 
Enterprises. But as good as the pitching was that season, it wasn't the primary 
force in the team's drive to the World Series championship. And Strawberry no 
longer is the person -- and perhaps not the player -- he was then. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Mets scored early and buried opponents. And on those rare occasions 
with they fell behind, they knew they could come back against any pitcher who 
wasn't named Scott or Krukow. They dared opponents to bunt on them. They 
infuriated other teams. They out-arroganced everyone. 
</P>
<P>
There was the grit of "Backstra," the intensity of Hernandez, Carter and 
Knight, the talent of Strawberry and Mitchell and the mystical Mookie element. 
And Johnson knew how to make it all work together. They traveled with arrogance 
and intimidation in their bags. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the starting pitching was critical. But Dwight Gooden was merely 
very good, not great. Ron Darling was good but not very good, and Bob Ojeda, a 
critical clubhouse force these days, was in his first season with the team and 
never asserted himself as he has this year. Sid Fernandez hadn't emerged, and 
David Cone and Frank Viola were in the other league. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry was a primary factor and personality then, but his role has shrunk 
dramatically in the aftermath of his alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
And now Johnson is gone. There is little or no arrogance. Losing records don't 
lend themselves to feelings of superiority. But is this a case of cause and 
effect or effect and cause? Is this collection of Mets not arrogant enough to 
play well or are they unable to play well enough to become arrogant? Probably 
both. Right now, they don't have personnel that opponents fear. 
</P>
<P>
These Mets are not going to recreate 1986 and that team's intensity and need to 
succeed. And because they aren't -- or can't -- they'd be better off not trying 
to. Turn the page. Forget it. Stop using it as a point of reference. They are 
far enough removed from it in time, talent and personnel to make a divorce 
work. 
</P>
<P>
These Mets ought to establish a new personality and remove themselves from the 
long shadows of '86. Johnson was part of that shadow. With him gone and Bud 
Harrelson in his place, they have the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Expect Kevin Elster to emerge as more of the team leader and spokesman now that 
Harrelson is in place. 
</P>
<P>
There's every reason to believe Cashen wanted to make the move Wednesday, an 
off-day, with players dispersed and Johnson in Florida. It's hard to believe 
he's a former newspaper man. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's talking about Johnson moving to the Yankees. If he wasn't enough of 
a disciplinarian for Cashen, how would he satisfy George Steinbrenner? How 
would he deal with Mel Hall? 
</P>
<P>
Why not Johnson to the Braves or Rangers? He has roots in both places. Why not 
Bobby Valentine to the Yankees?

RISING HOUSING COSTS SQUEEZE OXNARD'S POOR; 
</P>
<P>
CROWDING: THE WAITING LIST FOR SUBSIDIZED RESIDENCES CONTAINS MORE THAN 1,000 
NAMES AND HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
Renaldo Martinez Rios is one of 1,100 laborers and fieldworkers crowded into 
140 trailers at the Oxnard Mobile Home Lodge near the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The $20-a-day strawberry picker and his 12-member family share a three-room 
trailer that is so cramped the family is forced to prepare its meals outside, 
next to a dusty street. 
</P>
<P>
Rios would like to move. "The problem is not finding a place where we can live, 
but finding a place that we can afford," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, where almost half of the households are considered low-income, 
crowding among the poor is a growing problem as rapidly escalating land values 
dry up the supply of low-cost housing. The city estimated in 1989 that there 
were 6,500 overcrowded households, defined as residences with more than one 
person per room. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to other cities in the county, "I think the problem is more intense in 
the city of Oxnard," said Sal Gonzalez, the city's housing director. "I think 
we have a greater incidence of overcrowding and doubling up." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is that Oxnard has long been a haven for working-class, 
low-income families who cannot afford to buy a home. Reflecting this trend, 
Oxnard has the county's highest number of low-income households (18,255) -- 
those earning less than $24,300 a year -- and the highest number of rental 
units (19,964). 
</P>
<P>
Although Oxnard's total of 780 subsidized housing units also is the highest 
number in the county, the waiting list contains more than 1,000 names and has 
been closed for several years. The Oxnard Housing Authority assists another 
1,219 lower-income residents by allocating funds through the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 program, Housing Programs Manager 
Bernard Carn said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics say Oxnard has not done enough. 
</P>
<P>
"All they are approving is housing in the higher end . . . They do not have a 
balanced housing program, period," said Rodney Fernandez, executive director of 
Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group that has built 427 units 
of low-income and farm-worker housing in Ventura County since 1975, none of 
them in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the problem is very bad," he said. "I think Oxnard is one of the 
communities that has done the least in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Rochelle Stephens, deputy director of the county's Area Housing Authority, said 
that since Oxnard closed its waiting list for subsidized housing, the county 
has received 25 to 35 applications each week from Oxnard residents seeking such 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Housing director Gonzalez acknowledged that in recent years the city has been 
slow to develop affordable housing, in part because the city had difficulty 
obtaining housing grants from the federal government throughout the 1980s. 
Federal housing officials have held back the grants, saying the city had 
already built a disproportionately large number of such units during the 1970s, 
Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said the city has been approving housing projects for buyers in the 
high end of the income scale because developers for years have found it 
economically infeasible to build low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the city is trying to address the problem, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of complaints in central and northeast Oxnard over noise, lack of 
parking and the illegal conversion of garages and toolsheds into rental units 
in crowded neighborhoods, the city formed a committee of seven department heads 
in July, 1989, to study the overcrowding problem. 
</P>
<P>
The committee met weekly for several months and produced a survey and two 
reports, which included alternative solutions to the problem for the City 
Council to consider. The reports focused primarily on increasing housing 
inspections and imposing a mandatory fine for households that violate the state 
housing occupancy laws. 
</P>
<P>
One report suggested surprise after-hour inspections, requiring all residents 
to obtain parking permits and limiting the number of permits that can be issued 
per residence. Those recommendations are being studied for inclusion in a 
detailed report to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez also said the city recently set up an advisory panel consisting of 
city officials and community leaders to investigate means of developing more 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the outlook for increased federal aid to build low-cost 
housing is improving, he said. Federal officials are looking more favorably on 
Oxnard projects, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we provide housing for everybody that wants it? No, that is not possible," 
said Community Development Director Richard Maggio. "I think we are at least 
trying to address the problem in some fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Cabrillo Economic Development's Fernandez said one of the prime examples of 
overcrowding is the Oxnard Mobile Home Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant hired by the city recommended two years ago that the city relocate 
the 848 residents who were then living in the 5.2-acre mobile home park. The 
consultant, Sanchez Talarico Associates of Newport Beach, said in a report that 
there have been two fires at the park, one that destroyed three trailers in 
1985 and another in 1987 that destroyed a metal shed being used as a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said there are now about 1,100 residents living in that same park. In 
one case, as many as 24 residents live in one mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
"In Mexico the people are poor but at least their houses are spacious and 
comfortable," said Luis Terran, a disabled fieldworker who has led a fight for 
better conditions at the mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant's report said the only solution lies in finding a developer 
willing to buy the trailer park, close it down and build a new one elsewhere. 
Gonzalez said the city is working on acquiring a site for the new park. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems in addressing the crowding problem is that efforts to clean 
up blighted areas can imperil the poor who live there. For example, the Lemon 
Tree Motel on Meta Street, located in a gritty, low-income neighborhood of bars 
and restaurants, has been tagged by the city for demolition to make way for a 
public parking lot as part of a downtown redevelopment program. 
</P>
<P>
Bertha Ochoa, the owner of the motel, said her 44 apartments are among the last 
remaining affordable housing units in the city. If the city tears the building 
down, she warns that almost all of the 150 tenants will have no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no palace or Holiday Inn, but it's a roof over their heads," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Melendi, a cook, and her boyfriend, Arturo Taja, who delivers phone 
books, pay $320 a month to live in a one-room apartment no bigger than a 
one-car garage where they cook on a hot plate on a dresser and share a 
bathroom. But even that is better than being on the streets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since she bought the building in August, 1989, Ochoa has fought a bitter battle 
to keep the city from condemning it. She has even hired a Santa Monica attorney 
to try to persuade a federal court judge to halt demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials told Ochoa that state law requires the city to find 
affordable housing for each tenant that is displaced through a redevelopment 
condemnation project, she and her tenants remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are they going to put us?" she said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: 20-YEAR-OLD HELD IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>

<P>
A 20-year-old Oxnard man was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of 
participating in a drive-by shooting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that a car with its lights switched off parked outside a 
house in the 400 block of Helsam Street in El Rio and fired into the living 
room window of a house, said Lt. Joe Funchess of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on witnesses' accounts, sheriff's deputies arrested Fidel Melendez at his 
house about 6 a.m. Saturday, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether the incident was gang-related, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez was arrested on suspicion of shooting at an occupied dwelling and for 
several outstanding warrants, including failing to appear in court on a traffic 
citation, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez was being held Saturday at the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,500 
bail, Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Larson said. PEGGY Y. LEE

BULLS TO FACE PISTON MALICE IN THE PALACE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: CHICAGO MUST PLAY GAME 7 TODAY IN AUBURN HILLS, WHERE IT HAS 
GONE 0-5. 
</P>

<P>
The Detroit Pistons head into Game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals 
against the Chicago Bulls today at the Palace of Auburn Hills with far more 
big-game experience. But the Bulls have Michael Jordan, which can neutralize a 
lot of factors. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, as Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said of the Bulls: "They're fairly playoff 
hardened. I don't know if we have an advantage on that point." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has been in similar circumstances two years in a row. Last season, the 
Pistons won in six games. This time, the Bulls can finish a comeback from an 
0-2 deficit with one more victory. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is lay our guts on the floor and see what happens," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Beating the Pistons in Chicago Friday proved the Bulls' fortitude, but Chicago 
hasn't won here all season -- a stretch of five games, three in the playoffs. 
Today, they may be without starting guard John Paxson, who took treatment but 
did not practice Saturday after re-injuring his right ankle in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
The return of Craig Hodges should be of some comfort to the Bulls. Hodges' 19 
points helped the Bull reserves outscore their Detroit counterparts for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
Only once in their 24-year history have the Bulls been this close to the title 
round. In 1975, they held a 3-2 advantage over the Golden State Warriors, only 
to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night, more than one Bull was heard to say today will be for a 
franchise and a city, not just a team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's going to be a lot of speeches made," Jordan said. "Certainly, 
as a leader I'll have to throw my two cents in to let them know that (in) the 
years I've been in Chicago, we've progressed each and every year. We've taken 
it a step further, and this is an opportunity to take it another step further. 
We may never get this opportunity again." 
</P>
<P>
And the Pistons will have history to contend with, too. Trying to join 
Minneapolis/Los Angeles and Boston as the only franchises to win back-to-back 
titles, Detroit is 0-3 in previous seventh games. The most recent attempt came 
against the Lakers for the 1988 championship. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, only four teams have come back from 2-0 down to win a seven-game series: 
Boston against the Lakers in 1969, the Lakers against San Francisco in 1969, 
Baltimore against New York in 1971 and Portland against Philadelphia in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
The championship round will open Tuesday night. If Detroit wins today, the 
Pistons will have home-court advantage. If the Bulls win, the series will begin 
at Portland and go to Chicago for Games 3, 4 and 5 in the 2-3-2 scheduling 
format. . . . After losing Friday night, the Pistons arrived at Midway Airport 
and were told that the nose of their private jet had been cracked when a fuel 
truck backed into it. . . . Michael Jordan has shot 48.7% and averaged 35 
points in the three games at Chicago Stadium while shooting 39.2% and averaging 
22.8 points at Auburn Hills. . . . The Bulls are shooting only 41.5%.

MARINERS' JOHNSON NO-HITS TIGERS

On the days that Randy Johnson pitches, his teammates go out of their way to 
avoid him. Way out of their way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very moody person," the 6-foot-10 left-hander said Saturday night after 
pitching the first no-hitter in Seattle Mariners' history, a 2-0 victory over 
the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just ask Brian Holman. If he were here, he would tell you that. I like to be 
in my own little world. I don't like people talking to me. People have called 
me another Bill Lee." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Johnson (4-3) overcame his own wildness, walking six and 
striking out eight. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson a left-hander acquired from the Montreal Expos on May 25, 1989, in the 
trade for Mark Langston, pitched the first no-hitter at the Kingdome, which 
opened for baseball in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He said another Mariners' left-hander, Matt Young, was the only teammate to 
speak to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat next to Matt and he said, 'Come on, R.J., let's go out and do it,' " 
Johnson said. "Brian Giles came by and shook my hand but didn't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson entered the game with a 4.73 earned-run average and had allowed 12 home 
runs, the most in the major leagues. His previous low-hit game was a five-hit 
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on July 23, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the walks and two of the strikeouts came against Cecil Fielder, who 
shares the major league lead in home runs with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson struck out Fielder on three pitches to begin the ninth inning. Chet 
Lemon fouled out to first baseman Alvin Davis and Mike Heath then struck out 
swinging on an 0-and-2 pitch, Johnson's 136th pitch of the game, as the crowd 
of 20,014 erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson threw 87 strikes and 49 balls. The Mariners said he had 50 pitches of 
94 m.p.h. and more. His final pitch, to strike out Heath, was clocked at 97 
m.p.h., his fastest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's toughest jam came in the sixth inning, when he loaded the bases on 
walks to Tony Phillips, Gary Ward and Fielder, but struck out Lemon to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Ward hit the hardest ball of the night for the Tigers, a 365-foot fly in the 
first inning that center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. caught one step in front of 
the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, Tracy Jones hit a slow roller to third baseman Edgar 
Martinez, whose throw pulled Davis off the bag. But umpire Derryl Cousins ruled 
that Davis tagged Jones on the helmet. Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson came out 
of the dugout to protest, but after the game, the Tigers said Jones was 
definitely out. 
</P>
<P>
"He was out," Anderson said. "I checked with my guy (Jones)." 
</P>
<P>
"I was out," Jones said. "The umpire was waiting for the tag to see if he 
(Davis) dropped the ball, but he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the key for him was pitching inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a power pitcher," he said. "I give up a lot of home runs. Scott Bradley 
and I talked about it before the game. We decided I had to throw my fastball 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
Ward also reached when shortstop Mike Brumley bobbled his routine grounder in 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second no-hitter of the season but the first complete-game 
nine-inning no-hitter in the majors since the Cincinnati Reds' Tom Browning 
pitched a perfect game against the Dodgers on Sept. 16, 1988. The last 
complete-game no-hitter in the American League was pitched by the Milwaukee 
Brewers' Juan Nieves against the Baltimore Orioles on April 15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners were the victims of this year's no-hitter, as Langston and Mike 
Witt combined to pitch the Angels to a 1-0 victory over the Mariners on April 
11. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners have had four one-hitters in their 14-year history. The most 
recent was on April 20, when Holman got the first 26 outs before allowing a 
homer to Ken Phelps in a 6-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Holman wasn't on hand to see his teammate accomplish what he didn't. His wife 
gave birth to a baby in Kansas this week and Holman was still with her. 
</P>
<P>
The no-hitter was the 12th pitched against the Tigers and the first since the 
Angels' Nolan Ryan beat them, 6-0, on July 15, 1973.

Rob Deer played only part of the game Saturday, but he played a key role. 
</P>
<P>
Deer entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning, but made two 
dazzling catches in right field and drove in the tying runs with a two-run 
single in the seventh as the Milwaukee Brewers rallied for a 7-6 victory over 
the Blue Jays at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I never lost confidence in my defense," Deer said. "I've been more concerned 
with my hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor started the seventh with a solo home run to left field off 
reliever Jim Acker, his sixth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker and Eddie Diaz walked before B.J. Surhoff advanced both runners 
with a sacrifice bunt off loser David Wells (2-1). Greg Brock flied out to 
shallow left and Wells walked Bill Spiers to load the bases for Deer. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Ward, a right-hander, relieved, but Deer hit a line-drive single to 
right, scoring Parker and Diaz to tie the score, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Spiers took third on Junior Felix's throwing error and scored the winning run 
on Greg Myers' passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Deer robbed Kelly Gruber of extra bases with a diving catch in the bottom of 
the sixth, then raced into foul territory to snare Tony Fernandez's pop-up in 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, New York 2 -- Randy Milligan broke the Orioles' bases-loaded 
drought with a two-run single in the fifth inning at New York, handing the 
Yankees their sixth loss in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore, batting .200 with the bases loaded this season, broke through in the 
fifth when Milligan singled for a 3-2 lead. Milligan was hitless in three tries 
with the bases loaded this year, but he has reached base in 17 of his last 23 
plate appearances, going nine for 15 with eight walks. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson (4-3) won for the second time in eight starts, giving up two runs 
on eight hits in five innings. Gregg Olson went two shutout innings to get his 
10 save. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Leary (3-6) gave up three runs on nine hits in five innings. He is 0-3 
lifetime against Baltimore, yielding 11 earned run in 16 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 10, Oakland 4 -- Gerald Perry had three hits and scored two runs as 
the Royals took advantage of two errors by third baseman Mike Gallego to score 
five unearned runs and beat the Athletics at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Saberhagen (5-3) won his fourth consecutive start and improved to 10-6 
against Oakland. He has not lost since May 1. Saberhagen went seven innings, 
allowing two runs and eight hits. He walked one and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (4-5) lasted 3 1/3 innings -- the shortest stint this season by an 
A's starter. Moore, 2-7 in Kansas City, yielded nine runs and nine hits, 
including three doubles and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, Chicago 1 -- Dan Gladden, hitless in his last 10 at-bats, hit a 
run-scoring double with two out in the eighth inning, lifting the Twins to 
victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Gagne singled with two out in the eighth for the third hit off Chicago 
starter Eric King (4-1). Gladden followed with a liner off the fence in 
left-center, scoring Gagne. 
</P>
<P>
King walked one and struck out five in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 7, Boston 5 -- Stan Jefferson, batting .088 entering the game, had 
two singles, scored three runs and drove in the game-winner in the eighth 
inning as the Indians rallied to victory at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Browne drew a one-out walk from Rob Murphy (0-3). Carlos Baerga followed 
with a double to center, scoring Browne with the tying run. Jefferson then 
singled through the left side, scoring Baerga.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Riddled Redbirds: The St. Louis Cardinal lineup that Manager Whitey Herzog 
likes to call an undisciplined collection of ping hitters had produced two or 
fewer runs in 19 of 47 games through Thursday, and three or fewer in 27 games. 
"We're just pathetic offensively," Herzog said. Among the most pathetic: Milt 
Thompson, with eight hits in his last 61 at-bats, and Jose Oquendo, 10 for his 
last 62. "Jose looks like he never played before," Herzog said. "Milt, too. 
It's a joke, but they're not the only ones. We're 12th in the league in 
average, 12th in runs scored, 12th in home runs and 10th in doubles. It tells 
you something when you can't even get a double." 
</P>
<P>
* Magrane's Migraine: The inoffensive Cardinals have made it tough on 
left-hander Joe Magrane to work out of a rut in which he has won two of his 
last 17 starts. Magrane, 18-9 with a 2.81 earned-run average last year, is 2-8, 
the Cardinals having scored 15 runs in his eight defeats. Wednesday night, he 
lost to the Houston Astros, 2-1, despite allowing only one earned run in 7 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
* Blew Brew: The Milwaukee Brewers led the American League with 155 errors last 
year and are back at it, having made 55 in 44 games, which projects to a 
club-record 204. The 1985 Dodgers are the only team to have won a division 
title while finishing last in the league in fielding, but anything is possible 
in the AL East. The Cleveland Indians, for example, went 11-13 against Western 
Division opponents and picked up 1 1/2 games in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
* Lumbering Lumberman: At 38 and carrying 235 pounds on knees that give the 
impression of collapsing with every stride, Dave Parker had driven in 28 runs 
for the Brewers through Thursday, delivering more triples, three, and as many 
stolen bases, two, as home runs. Parker had one triple in his previous three 
seasons and no steals in his two seasons with the Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
Relapse of the Year: Lonnie Smith was the National League's comeback player of 
the year with the Atlanta Braves in 1989 but he is now only platooning with 
Oddibe McDowell in left field. Smith began a weekend series at San Diego 
Thursday with a .228 batting average, one home run, 12 runs batted in and 
almost as many strikeouts, 25, as hits, 27, in 118 at-bats. The league leader 
in on-base percentage in 1989, his 1990 on-base percentage of .308 was only 
eighth-best among Atlanta position players. 
</P>
<P>
Braves II: Atlanta finished May with a 13-14 record, blowing a shot at its 
first winning month since May 1987 by losing to the San Diego Padres, 2-1, 
Thursday night. Only two of the current Braves, Dale Murphy and Andres Thomas, 
were with the team when it had that last winning month, and only seven of the 
current Braves were in the majors at that time. ROSS NEWHAN

RICH A'S CAN GET RICHER WITH PICKS IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having used the annual June draft of high school and college players to help 
build their budding dynasty, the Oakland A's have a chance to reinforce it with 
seven of the first 66 choices in the three-day process that begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
And the A's seem to have the right formula. 
</P>
<P>
They have drafted and developed three of the last four winners of the American 
League's rookie of the year award -- Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Walt Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
Their seven early selections in this year's draft include five compensation 
picks for the loss of free agents Storm Davis, Dave Parker and Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited," said Dick Bogard, A's scouting director. "We know we're going 
to get some good players. Our biggest need throughout the system is pitching, 
and that's what we'll try to address." 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Expos have a shot at an even bigger jackpot with 10 of the first 
53 picks, the compensation for failing to sign their No. 1 selection of last 
year and losing Hubie Brooks, Mark Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez as 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos always have done well in the draft. All of their regulars, except 
shortstop Spike Owen, were drafted and developed in the Expo system. Montreal's 
problems surface when their players become eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Hughes, Montreal's scouting director: "We haven't had much success in 
attracting or keeping free agents. But if we build a successful organization, 
players will want to stay and players will want to come." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's No. 1 is pitcher Todd Van Poppel of Martin High in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
But Van Poppel has said that he will attend the University of Texas rather than 
sign. Is that leverage? 
</P>
<P>
The Braves have the first pick and Paul Snyder, Atlanta's scouting director, is 
spending the weekend in Arlington, trying to convince Van Poppel that owner Ted 
Turner has a lot to offer. 
</P>
<P>
If Van Poppel convinces the Braves that he will not sign, the Expos, who draft 
11th, are expected to risk one of their top 10 picks on him, with the Braves 
making Iowa shortstop Tim Costo their No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California players expected to go in the first round include 
outfielder Tony Clark of Christian High in El Cajon, who is also considering 
playing basketball at Arizona; first baseman Mark Newfield of Marina High in 
Huntington Beach; catcher Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High in Westlake Village; 
catcher Paul Ellis of UCLA; shortstop Aaron Holbert of Jordan High in Long 
Beach, and pitcher Kurt Miller of West High in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Two local players with familiar bloodlines could go in the second round or 
higher -- infielder Bret Boone of USC and outfielder Gary Mota of Fullerton 
Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Boone, who enhanced his status with an impressive display of power in NCAA 
regional play, is coveted by the Boston Red Sox, for whom his grandfather, 
former major leaguer Ray Boone, scouts. Mota is also being wooed by Arizona 
State and has yet to complete the three years of college that his dad, Manny 
Mota, demands of his sons. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, coming off what can be kindly called spotty performances in recent 
drafts, select ninth in the first round but do not hold a second- or 
third-round choice because of the signing of free agents Brooks and Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers do get two compensation picks between the second and third rounds 
after losing free agents John Tudor and Dave Anderson, and Scouting Director 
Ben Wade said he expects to find quality players. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who draft 24th, do not have a first-round selection because of 
Langston's signing, but they are not upset. After making Jim Abbott their No. 1 
in 1988 and Kyle Abbott their No. 1 in 1989, there is not another Abbott who 
fits their No. 1 mold anyway. 
</P>
<P>
There has been suspicion that the 1990 baseball contains the same juice as the 
1987 model, but, although home runs are up in both the American and National 
leagues over last year, the pace does not compare to '87, when the National 
produced a record 1,824 homers and the American had a record 2,634. 
</P>
<P>
The current American League pace projects to 2,165, the National to 1,531. 
</P>
<P>
Through 40 games for every team, the yardstick employed by the Elias Sports 
Bureau, there had been 378 homers hit in the National League, an increase of 83 
over a similar period in 1989 but 106 behind the '87 pace. 
</P>
<P>
In the American League, there had been 481 homers hit, an increase of 65 over 
last year but 165 fewer than the '87 pace. 
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the increase over last year, most cite the full-time availability 
of Jose Canseco and Andre Dawson, the emergence of Cecil Fielder, the lockout 
that left starting pitchers unprepared to sustain their stamina or throw 
breaking balls through April and a deterioration of quality pitching in the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
Having surpassed Ty Cobb's American League stolen-base record with his 893rd 
steal Tuesday night, Oakland's Rickey Henderson is confident he will top Lou 
Brock's major league record of 938 sometime in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be remembered as an all-around player, but I know that the 
base-stealing will stand out," he said. "I expect to steal 1,200 to 1,500 
before I'm through." 
</P>
<P>
Fired manager Davey Johnson will get $850,000 in guaranteed salary from the New 
York Mets through 1991, but the decision could prove even more costly to the 
Mets if Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds make good on indications that 
they will now leave as free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, eligible to go after the 1990 season, said Johnson's firing "pretty 
much finalizes my decision." 
</P>
<P>
He and Johnson had a number of confrontations, but Strawberry said, "Even with 
all our disagreements, I love the man, I really do. He stood by me when it got 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds, eligible to leave after the 1991 season, said of the Mets' 
decision, "It stinks. I mean, I guess his history with the Mets doesn't matter 
to the geniuses in the front office." 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds may not have to think about moving far. Rumors persist that Johnson 
will ultimately replace Bucky Dent as manager of the cross-town Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
A headline in the New York Daily News the other day read: "Davey Preys While 
Bucky Prays." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledged Johnson: "I'd like to manage the Yankees. I don't want to put any 
pressure on Bucky, but I've learned to manage in the toughest market in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Yankees make it that much tougher, considering the involvement 
of owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Johnson wasn't sure who ran the Mets, calling General Manager Frank 
Cashen and Vice Presidents Joe McIlvaine and Al Harazin a three-headed monster. 
</P>
<P>
"At least with George you'd have some conversations," he said, pausing before 
adding, "maybe too many." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, meanwhile, continues to leave the door open concerning Dent. He 
told New York reporters in Chicago the other day that he considered Johnson "a 
wonderful guy" and asked, "If you were the owner of a team 14 games (10, 
actually) under .500, what would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
One thing seems certain. Unless the Yankees -- who on top of all else lack 
heart and guts, according to outfielder Mel Hall -- make a move in the 
standings during a 26-game stretch against Eastern Division opponents that 
began Friday, Dent will be out. Caught in the current crossfire, Dent's skin is 
thickening in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets aggravating and annoying to hear the same questions every day," he 
said. " 'Are you secure? Are you worried?' I don't even think about it. As I've 
said, by the time I leave I'll be an armadillo." 
</P>
<P>
The miseries continue to mount for the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outfielder Kevin Bass goes on the 21-day disabled list and will be 
sidelined two to three months because of knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Rick Reuschel, 6-0 in May of last year and 0-5 in May of this year, 
twists a knee and joins two other starting pitchers, Kelly Downs and Mike 
LaCoss, on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another starter, Don Robinson, is activated after rehabilitating a 
surgically repaired knee, only to suffer back spasms that require a cortisone 
injection and leave him an indefinite starter today against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Mitchell, batting .375 on the road through Thursday but only .253 at 
home, where the Giants were 6-16 through Thursday, decides that the wind and 
dust at Candlestick Park are too tough on his contact lenses and will try 
glasses as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Clark, with one hit in his last 22 at-bats through Thursday, ends a 
string of nine consecutive months in which he has hit .300 or better by batting 
.203 in May. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising success of his Minnesota Twins hasn't created any illusions for 
Manager Tom Kelly in a division dominated by the A's. 
</P>
<P>
What will it take for the Twins to win? 
</P>
<P>
"A miracle. That's all, a miracle," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres opened a 13-game home stand Thursday -- a make-or-break 
span, perhaps. The Padres won three in a row and five of their last six on the 
road after a team meeting prompted by Mike Pagliarulo's comments regarding the 
selfishness of a leading San Diego player. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo didn't identify the player but left no doubt that it was Tony Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
The situation festered, with Gwynn and Pagliarulo exchanging media potshots, 
until Manager Jack McKeon called the meeting. Gwynn reportedly exchanged views 
with several players who supported Pagliarulo. Pitcher Eric Show and catcher 
Benito Santiago were among others who drew teammates' fire for their attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there were some hurt feelings, and I know a lot of guys didn't like 
what was being said about them, but you don't have to be best friends to play 
good together on the field," Pagliarulo said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, if guys don't like me for what I said, get in line. I'll be damned if 
I'm going to play for a mediocre team. I want to play on a winner, and I'm 
going to do everything I possibly can to make it a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Clark: "There was a lot of bad stuff going on. When guys were 
stealing bases, for instance, we'd actually step out of the way to give the 
catcher a better chance of throwing the runner out. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're a team again. We've come a long way in the past week. I'm not saying 
everything's perfect yet. We're still going to have a few more meetings to get 
things ironed out, but this is a start." 
</P>
<P>
Some comments . . . 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Tom Grieve of the Texas Rangers on speculation that Manager 
Bobby Valentine is in trouble: "I don't believe in firing the manager when 
things go bad. That's a panic move, and I don't panic." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson on Bo Jackson's acceleration: "Yes, he 
can really excel." 
</P>
<P>
Recently retired pitcher Dan Quisenberry, on his decision to reject job offers 
that would have put him on the road again: "I want to see what it's like being 
married with children."

DYKSTRA IS EXCEPTION TO HIS RULE

<TEXT>
<P>
Len Dykstra says there is no way anyone is ever going to hit .400 again, but 
the Phillies' center fielder had three more hits Saturday night to increase his 
batting average to .405 as Philadelphia defeated the New York Mets, 5-4, at 
Philadelphia to end a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra has hit in 15 consecutive games, the longest streak in the National 
League this season. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to do that (bat .400) in today's game," Dykstra said. "With 
all the good pitching, good relief pitching and traveling, it just won't ever 
happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing, though, it's a great feeling to step in the box and know I'm going 
to hit the ball hard," Dykstra said. "I've just been trying to get on base and 
I'm in a real good groove." 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra insists he gets no special thrill in beating his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing real special, but it's nice to beat them," he said. "We've got to 
play them 16 more times, so the main thing is to establish that we can play 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
Phillie starter Ken Howell (6-3) gave up three runs, struck out seven and 
walked three in seven innings. Roger McDowell relieved Howell after a walk to 
Darryl Strawberry to open the eighth, and recorded his National League-leading 
13th save. 
</P>
<P>
Met starter Dwight Gooden (3-5) gave up four runs and nine hits in six innings, 
walking three and striking out two. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, Houston 4 -- Mike Kingery's run-scoring single, his second of 
the game and National League career, with two outs in the bottom of the 10th 
inning won it for the Giants at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Kingery, who played last season in Seattle, also had an RBI single as the 
Giants overcame a 3-0 deficit in a three-run ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros had taken the lead in the top of the inning on Franklin Stubbs' 
run-scoring double off Steve Bedrosian (2-3) before the Giants rallied against 
Danny Darwin (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell started the 10th with a walk and took third on Terry Kennedy's 
one-out single. Robby Thompson lofted a bunt over first baseman Stubbs' head, 
scoring Mitchell to tie the game. Pitcher Scott Garrelts pinch ran for Kennedy 
at second base and scored on Kingery's hit to center. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 9, Atlanta 0 -- Ed Whitson pitched his fourth complete game and 
second shutout, and Tony Gwynn and Roberto Alomar led a 14-hit Padre attack at 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn had three hits, including two doubles and three RBIs. Alomar scored four 
times for San Diego and got three hits, including his second homer. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson (5-3) pitched a five-hitter to tie Mike Morgan of the Dodgers for most 
complete games in the National League. The Braves only had one runner reach 
second base. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Montreal 3 -- R.J. Reynolds tied the score in the eighth inning, 
then doubled home Jay Bell to win it in the 10th at Pittsburgh as the Pirates 
ended the Expos' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, St. Louis 6 -- The Cubs' Dwight Smith hit a sacrifice fly in the 
ninth inning to score Shawon Dunston at St. Louis in a battle to escape last 
place.

<P>
California's Sheila Hudson fulfilled a promise by breaking her American record 
in the triple jump and Wisconsin's Suzy Favor completed an illustrious career 
by winning a record ninth title at the NCAA Track and Field Championships at 
Duke University Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State swept the men's and women's titles for the second year in a 
row, the only team to achieve such a sweep. The men had 44 points to 36 for 
indoor champion Arkansas and 34 for Baylor. The Lady Tigers won their fourth 
consecutive title with 53 points, led by sprinter Esther Jones. UCLA had 46 and 
Wisconsin 42. The UCLA women finished second for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson, in her final college meet, leaped 46 feet three-quarters of an inch to 
complete a jump double. She won the long jump Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Favor's final college meet ended with her fourth consecutive 1,500-meter title 
that, along with her 800 victory Friday, gave her two championships for the 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Jones led LSU by sweeping the 100- and 200-meter races Saturday night after 
anchoring the Tigers to victory in the 400-meter relay Friday night. She took 
the 100 in a wind-aided 11.14 seconds and the 200 in 22.49, the fastest by an 
American this year. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the long jump Friday night, Hudson said she would take a serious 
shot at the triple jump record of 45-5 1/4 she set in 1987 at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
She made good on her promise twice. On her second attempt, she sailed 45-7 3/4, 
improving the record by 2 1/2 inches. On her fifth jump, she became the first 
American to jump 46 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson's jump was the best in the world outdoors this year. 
</P>
<P>
The triple jump title was Hudson's third in an outdoor championship. 
</P>
<P>
Favor, a senior with a cross-country season of eligibility remaining, swept to 
an unprecedented fourth consecutive title in the outdoor 1,500 meters. She 
pulled away down the final straightaway for a seven-meter victory over 
Tennessee's Jasmin Jones in 4 minutes 8.26 seconds, the fastest by a collegian 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Favor, who never has lost in the NCAA championships, won her first outdoor 
800-meter title Friday night. She also has won three NCAA indoor titles in the 
mile and one indoors at 3,000 meters. In four years at Wisconsin, she won 54 of 
56 races against college competition, the last 40 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lewis of UCLA, 1988 Olympic 400-meter gold medalist, won his first NCAA 
title, in 45.19 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Tracie Millett became the fourth woman and first Bruin woman to win two 
titles when she put the shot 53 feet 7 inches. She won the discus at 183-9 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She and Janeene Vickers lent luster to an otherwise disappointing showing by 
UCLA's women. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we wanted to come out on top, but I was very proud of the kids 
tonight," UCLA Coach Bob Kersee said. "Janeene and Tracie showed the quality of 
athlete they are today." 
</P>
<P>
Vickers defended her title in the 400-meter hurdles, winning in the time of 
55.40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
She also placed fourth in the 100-meter hurdles with a wind-aided time of 13.05 
seconds, a personal best. And she anchored the 1,600-meter relay team that 
finished fourth in 3:32.88. 
</P>
<P>
In men's competition, UCLA finished 10th with 22 points, and USC scored only 
nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC's Travis Hannah was sixth in 45.90 and UCLA's Mike Stevenson was eighth in 
46.60. . . . USC's Mark Crear was third in the 110-meter high hurdles with a 
personal best legal time of 13.65 seconds. . . . UCLA's John Knight finished 
fifth in the hammer throw at 210-9 and Eric Bergreen was eighth in the shotput 
with a mark of 59-7 1/2.

Favored Takin On The Cash broke on the lead and was never really challenged in 
winning the $233,000 Kindergarten Stakes for 2-year-olds at Los Alamitos 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
With Danny Cardoza in the saddle for his third career Kindergarten victory, the 
Dash For Cash colt won by one length and was timed in 17.65 seconds for 350 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Takin On The Cash has won three of his five career starts and earned $185,000. 
</P>
<P>
Takin On The Cash had been beaten in his Kindergarten trial on May 23, but 
trainer Caesar Dominguez was confident. 
</P>
<P>
Takin On The Cash paid $7.00, $4.00 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
Raised Toperfection, with thoroughbred jockey Gary Stevens in the saddle, 
finished eighth.

IN THE DAYS WHEN HONUS WAGNER WAS A TEUTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HAMELIN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sportswriters don't appear to have changed much since the turn of the century. 
We are still putting our feet in our mouths, often two at a time, and letting 
our biases slither into our scribblings. 
</P>
<P>
Society as a whole appears to have done a bit better, though. At least umpires 
no longer court death when they make a tough call. 
</P>
<P>
What brings these things home is "The Unforgettable Season," a new Simon &amp; 
Schuster book by G.H. Fleming that details the 1908 National League race among 
Chicago, New York and Pittsburgh -- the closest, and arguably most dramatic, in 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Fred Merkle earned the nickname of "Bonehead," costing New York 
a game late in September -- and, as it turned out, the pennant. The winning run 
was on third and Merkle on first in the last of the ninth of a 1-1 duel with 
Chicago. A mate lined the ball up the middle, apparently winning the game. But 
Merkle ran straight for the clubhouse without touching second, as was the 
custom in those days. 
</P>
<P>
No slave of custom, Joe Tinker, the Cubs' second baseman, screamed for the 
ball. But center fielder Artie Hofman threw wildly, the Giants' Joe McGinnity 
grabbed it ... and, alert to the force play Chicago was claiming, flung it into 
the crowd. The umpire ruled Merkle out, a riot ensued, and he ran for his life. 
After days of debate, the league upheld his ruling, and the game went into the 
books as a tie. 
</P>
<P>
When both clubs finished 98-55 (Pittsburgh was 98-56), the game had to be 
replayed. And before 35,000, baseball's biggest crowd ever, the Cubs beat 
37-game winner Christy Mathewson for the pennant 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming has gone back through the papers from each of those towns, and others, 
and recreated the race day by day through the eyes of the many knights of the 
keyboard who covered the teams. 
</P>
<P>
The editing must have taken forever. The result is enthralling. 
</P>
<P>
What most have forgotten, and which Fleming documents, is that the same thing 
had happened Sept. 4 when the Cubs lost to Pittsburgh. Chicago protested but 
lost because Hank O'Day, the game's only umpire, had run straight for the 
clubhouse, too, and hadn't seen whether the runner had touched second. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs were alert to the possibility, then. And so, the next time, was the 
umpire. By coincidence, Hank O'Day worked the game. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Giants, this was a time when papers covered their own 
teams prolifically and largely ignored all the rest. Only one of New York's 
many dailies, Fleming discovered, had carried any mention of that Cubs-Pirates 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad Merkle didn't subscribe to the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
But what sets this book apart are the glimpses into a long-ago time when papers 
were florid, and homerish, and good taste never got in the way of a 
sportswriter's joke. 
</P>
<P>
Mathewson " ... sent 12 Brooklyn lads back to the bench in disgrace after they 
had swung their floating ribs out of shape trying to hit his benders on the 
snoot," wrote Hype Igoe in the New York American. 
</P>
<P>
"Two other sluggish athletes from the banks of the Schuylkill were also 
massacred at the fourth bag and died in an erect attitude," reported the New 
York Press ... meaning two Pittsburgh runners were thrown out at home trying to 
score standing up. 
</P>
<P>
Of bowlegged Honus Wagner, a Pittsburgh paper wrote: "The big Teuton ... with 
head down and legs spread like this ( ), started for second." The same writer 
said the sound of a well-struck ball was "like the fall of a truck horse on a 
board sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
I still think the writing is better now, but I'm not as sure as I was. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it was a naive time in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
"Wagner's unnoticed single," said New York's Evening Journal, "established a 
record thatwill probably live after yesterday's game, the 1908 pennant race and 
even the National League are forgotten. . . . Two thousand hits!" 
</P>
<P>
Addictions were just shrugged away. The New York World carried a piece written 
by the Giants' second baseman, Larry Doyle, that said in part: "Nearly all 
ballplayers smoke, and I'm no exception." And the New York Globe reported 
offhandedly, "It was just one year ago yesterday since (Giants slugger Mike 
Donlin) boarded the water wagon. ..." 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, labor stood in awe of the management. The weekly Sporting Life 
reported that Cubs manager Frank Chance "forbade the marriage of Artie Hofman 
and beautiful Rae Looker until after the baseball season is over. ... 'I guess 
Miss Looker and I can wait,' said Mr. Hofman." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine what Jose Canseco would say, told to give up his sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
Even more striking is the insensitivity in 1908 to a man's nationality, 
physiognomy, bad habits and even his handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had a deaf mute named Taylor. His nickname was "Dummy." Manager John 
McGraw made his players learn sign language, which he used in the coaching box. 
"Maybe," observed the New York American, "that's why the Dummy is kept on the 
salary roll." 
</P>
<P>
The New York World observed of a dramatic Giants rally, "The Polo Grounds were 
now in bedlam. Dummy Taylor sprained three fingers trying to say something. ... 
" 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting News, "baseball's Bible," said this (incredibly): "The long-nosed 
rooters are crazy whenever young Herzog does anything noteworthy. There would 
be no let-up even if a million ham sandwiches suddenly fell among these 
believers in percentages and bargains." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, we have come a long way in most ways. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to excitement, Fleming suggests, we haven't seen a season 
like that one in all the years since.

SUPERSTITIONS IMPORTANT TO MANY PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MARBELLA, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles wear black stirrups instead of orange . . . and win a 
game. Slugger Mickey Tettleton puts on a Dick Tracy T-shirt . . . and breaks 
out of a slump. Relief pitchers pose Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, hop 
over white foul lines or sing on the mound . . . and save games. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidence? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players have long been a superstitious lot. And who are the Orioles to 
mess with tradition, especially when they're having an on-again, off-again 
season like this year? 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone believes in their own way," Tettleton says with a smile that 
barely cracks a jaw as square as Dick Tracy's own. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton gave an inadvertent boost to the big upcoming flick by letting on 
that he was wearing a Dick Tracy T-shirt under his uniform when he recently 
emerged from a frustrating slump at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it in the mail, I don't even know where it came from," he demurs. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton probably isn't the most superstitious Oriole -- despite his current 
streak, he hasn't even decided whether to keep wearing the T-shirt. But he's 
the most highly publicized one when the subject comes up. During a hot streak 
last year, for example, it was Froot Loops: His wife revealed that the cereal 
was the breakfast of this particular champion, and a legend was born. 
</P>
<P>
"You play so many games," the catcher says with a shrug, "more than anything, 
this sort of thing breaks the routine." 
</P>
<P>
Athletes, and baseball players in particular, can be more prone to 
superstitions than the rest of us, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such an element of chance in baseball, it makes it vulnerable to 
magical thinking," says Jim McGee, the Orioles' former team psychologist. "And 
there may be the sense that baseball, compared to other sports, is 
extraordinarily traditional. They still do things in 1990 that they did in 
1890." 
</P>
<P>
And who's to argue with someone like Joe Orsulak? His team-leading batting 
average -- for the third straight year -- lends credibility to his particular 
superstition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like pitchers touching my bat. It's bad luck," says the outfielder. "I 
won't use it if a pitcher's touched it." 
</P>
<P>
Orsulak also has used a sort of personal voodoo to psyche out a pitcher who has 
caused him difficulty in the past: He wore a T-shirt with the pitcher's name 
and face on it the next time he had to face him. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hits off him," he reports. 
</P>
<P>
But certainly the most superstitious player award on the team goes to Brian 
Holton. Hey kids, you, too, can be a major league relief pitcher! Clip and 
save: 
</P>
<P>
"I get dressed the same way every day. Then I button just three buttons of my 
warm-up jacket. I go and get a towel and wrap it around my neck, and the tag 
always has to be on the right side," Holton says. "I put two cans of Copenhagen 
(smokeless tobacco product) in my pocket, one from spring training and a new 
one. In my left pocket I carry a lasso. ... I found a piece of rope in San 
Diego once (in 1988) and made a lasso out of it and we went on a winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sit in the same seat in the bullpen and in the dugout," he continues. 
"I come up on the mound from the first base side. I wipe the (pitching) rubber 
four times with each leg and spin around clockwise. I catch the ball with one 
foot on the dirt and one foot on the grass. I never change catchers. If he's 
not ready (after batting in the last inning), I wait for him, I don't throw to 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sing on the mound to myself, whatever they're playing," Holton adds. 
"If they're not playing anything, I'll sing, 'You take the high road, I'll take 
the low road."' 
</P>
<P>
Holton says he started this routine as a 10-year-old (hmmm, perhaps not the 
part about the tobacco) and sees it more as a way to relax himself rather than 
to soothe the gods. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitchers, said McGee, who was team psychologist from 1980 to 1986, may 
need such rituals more than other players because of the unique nature of their 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Their tension level is always high, they can't tell when they're going in," he 
says. "If they don't perform their rituals, they feel anxious." 
</P>
<P>
McGee likens ritualistic superstitions to a behavior observed in animals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a naturally occurring form of superstitious behavior in animals. Take 
a little dog who every time he hears a big noisy truck runs to the same part of 
the back yard and starts to dig madly," McGee says. "The dog isn't digging 
because it thinks the truck will go away if it digs a hole. It's digging to 
avoid anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
McGee says superstitions have such a hold on us because, every once in a while, 
they "work." Actually, a lot of times they don't work, but you remember the 
payoffs rather than all the other times, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer you go without a payoff, the more you think it must be right around 
the corner," McGee said. "So, ironically, the longer you go without the 
superstition being reinforced, the more powerful the superstition becomes." 
</P>
<P>
Either that, or you try a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been switching batting gloves, wrist bands, changing bats. Nothing's 
really working," first baseman Randy Milligan says with a laugh. "I just keep 
doing things till it clicks." 
</P>
<P>
Some baseball superstitions, though, are immutable -- don't jinx a no-hitter by 
saying one's in progress. And watch the lines! 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I don't do is step on the white lines," says relief pitcher Mark 
Williamson of this commonly held superstition. "I just never have." 
</P>
<P>
And other superstitions are quite idiosyncratic -- probably no one in the 
majors besides Rene Gonzales tucks his glove in a Wonder Bread bag. 
</P>
<P>
"That goes back a long way, to my first year of college when a coach called me 
'Wonder Bread' because my defense had no holes. That was when there was that 
ad, 'Wonder Bread, it has no holes,"' the infielder says. 
</P>
<P>
There are some legendarily superstitious baseball players elsewhere -- the 
Boston Red Sox's Wade Boggs, for example, has a host of superstitions ranging 
from eating chicken to running sprints to, yes, road-trip girlfriend Margo 
Adams' underwear or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
Which could be why Brady Anderson, the Oriole outfielder who came up through 
the Red Sox farm system, has his unique superstition. 
</P>
<P>
"My superstition is not to have any superstitions," Anderson says. "I don't 
want to get any started."

MARINERS DISCOVER KNACK FOR FINDING YOUNG TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COUR, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Seattle Mariners have the two youngest players in the major leagues, and 
they're not both named Ken Griffey Jr. -- although it sometimes seems like it. 
</P>
<P>
The other 20-year-old Mariner is pitcher Brent Knackert, more or less stolen 
from the Chicago White Sox via the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, American League Player of the Month for April, is slightly younger. 
He'll be 21 on Nov. 21, Knackert on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still sinking in," Knackert said. "I've pitched to great players like 
Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners claimed Knackert on waivers April 5 from the Mets, who selected 
him off the White Sox roster in the Major League Rule V draft on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Since Knackert was on the White Sox Triple A roster when the Mets drafted him, 
major league rules say he must spend the season with the big-league Mariners or 
be offered back to the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"The White Sox didn't think anybody would take a 20-year-old kid because they 
would have to keep him in the major leagues," he said. "They wanted to teach me 
a lesson. They were shocked when they lost me. They admitted it was a stupid 
thing not to protect me after my third year." 
</P>
<P>
Especially with the kid-happy Mariners out there. The White Sox played right 
into the Mariners' hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Brent has a great future," Mariner General Manager Woody Woodward 
said. "It was our decision to stick with the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel certain if we offer Brent back to the White Sox, they will take him." 
</P>
<P>
Knackert was a second-round pick of the White Sox in 1987. He spent his third 
pro season with Class A Sarasota last season. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Knackert (1-0) has pitched 18 innings over 12 games and has a 3.50 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"If I only pitch 20 innings this year, it's a great experience," Knackert said. 
"I'll take this any day. I'll stay here. It's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Knackert's victory came in relief against California on May 3 in the Kingdome. 
That was special for him because he was born in Los Angeles and still lives in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He's watching and learning while Griffey dazzles fans, opponents and teammates 
with his spectacular offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just amazing," Knackert said. "He's a natural. It's unbelievable the 
pitches he hits. It's incredible the plays he makes. I've never seen anything 
like it."

WORLD CUP FIELD A COLLECTION OF HAVES, MIGHT HAVES, HAVE-NOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MILAN, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All World Cup teams are not created equal, and it is pointless to believe 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Dutch, for instance. Can anyone seriously think that the Netherlands, 
the reigning European champion, is the equal of, say, Egypt? 
</P>
<P>
Or look at Brazil, whose star-studded team waltzed away with the South American 
Championship a year ago. Does anyone believe the Brazilians are the equal of, 
well, the Americans? 
</P>
<P>
And what of Argentina, the defending world champion? Can Diego Maradona and 
company possibly be considered in the same class as, for example, Cameroon? 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. But that is one of the joys of the World Cup: It pits the giants 
against the giant-killers and sometimes the little guys win. 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon will be counting on that element of the unexpected here Friday night 
when it plays Argentina in the opening match of the month-long tournament. The 
game will be the first of 52 to be played in a dozen Italian cities that will 
decide the world champion. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 countries have been divided into six groups of four teams each. The 
teams will play a round-robin schedule within their group, with the top two 
teams in each group plus the four third-place teams with the best records 
advancing to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the first 36 matches between Friday and June 21 will cut the 
field to 16 teams. Even this, however, will not have removed all the chaff from 
the wheat. That takes a round of knockout play that will reduce the field to 
eight quarterfinalists. 
</P>
<P>
Any one of those eight should be capable of winning the World Cup, but the 
likelihood is that the solid-gold trophy once again will go to a former winner. 
Since it began in 1930, only six countries have won the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil (1958, 1962 and 1970) and Italy (1934, 1938 and 1982) have won three 
times; West Germany (1954 and 1974), Argentina (1978 and 1986) and Uruguay 
(1930 and 1950) have won twice, and England (1966) has won once. 
</P>
<P>
All six former champions are in the field and all are conceivable winners. 
Throw in the Netherlands and the Soviet Union and you have the eight teams from 
which the 1990 World Cup winner almost certainly will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the teams break down into three kinds: The eight from whom the 
winner is likely to come; the eight whose victory would be a huge upset, and 
the eight who stand almost no chance of winning. To cast a more kindly light on 
the last group, their victory was simply in qualifying for Italy. After all, 
110 nations tried, but only 22 succeeded. Italy, as the host country, and 
Argentina, as the defending World Cup champion, were exempt from having to 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAPSULE LOOKS AT THE 24 WORLD CUP TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
ITALY: As the host nation, Italy is a logical choice to win it all. The home 
team has won five of the 13 tournaments, including three of the past six. But 
even disregarding that advantage, Italy must be considered a likely finalist. 
Under Coach Azeglio Vicini, the Italians are, as usual, a potent defensive 
force, but they have yet to produce a match-winning goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain in 1982, they found one in Paolo Rossi, whose knack of putting the 
ball into the back of the net in crucial matches won Italy its third World Cup. 
This year, they will be counting on Gianluca Vialli, Roberto Donadoni and the 
latest boy wonder, Roberto Baggio, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Baggio last month was the subject of some furor in Italy when his club team, 
Fiorentina, sold him to Juventus of Turin for a record $13 million. That not 
only broke the world transfer record set by Napoli when it bought Maradona from 
Barcelona, but also caused fans in Florence to riot in protest of the sale. 
Baggio is brilliant but inconsistent, a fact that has not escaped Vicini's 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Italy will be difficult to score upon, with such veterans as 
goalkeeper Walter Zenga -- widely regarded as the world's best along with 
England's Peter Shilton -- and defenders Franco Baresi and Giuseppe Bergomi 
anchoring the back line. Italy's problem will not be stopping goals, but 
scoring them. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: If the players can cope with the tremendous pressure exerted by the 
Italian fans, who will accept nothing less than a World Cup victory, Italy 
should make it to the Final on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Winner, 1934, 1938, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Midfielder Roberto Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
BRAZIL: Although the Brazilians are one of the favorites in every tournament 
they enter, it has been 20 years since they won the World Cup. That was in 
Mexico, when the team featured Pele and Carlos Alberto. Now, there are new 
names -- Careca, Romario, Bebeto, Muller, Dunga, Valdo -- and the Brazilians 
once again are one of the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil has a unique record: It is the only country to have participated in 
every World Cup and has played and won more tournament matches than any 
country. Long known for their adventurous and inventive style of play, the 
Brazilians are always the most entertaining team to watch. The country's 
apparently unending supply of talent has generally been free to express itself 
on the field. This has meant exciting, attacking soccer, but has also left 
Brazil exposed on defense, a fact that cost it dearly in 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a new dimension has been added. Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni has introduced 
the "sweeper" -- sort of a free safety -- to Brazilian soccer. Since he did so 
last year, Brazil has been virtually unbeatable, winning its first South 
American Championship since 1949 and sweeping aside its qualifying opponents. 
The new formation allows midfielders such as Silas and Valdo the freedom to 
attack without worrying about the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, Lazaroni also has the luxury of four world-class strikers in Careca, 
Maradona's teammate at Napoli; Romario, who is recovering from a broken leg and 
might not play until the second round; the slightly built but exceptionally 
talented Bebeto, and 1986 veteran Muller. At the back, goalkeeper Claudio 
Taffarel not only defies custom by using both names, he is also the best at the 
position that Brazil has produced in a long while. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Only one South American team has won the World Cup when the 
tournament was played in Europe. That was Brazil in 1958, in Sweden. This team 
has all the credentials to repeat that feat. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Winner, 1958, 1962, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Striker Careca. 
</P>
<P>
WEST GERMANY: During the preliminary rounds, Franz Beckenbauer promised to 
resign as coach if West Germany failed to qualify. It was a safe bet. Germany 
has never failed to make the World Cup field, missing only the 1930 and 1950 
tournaments by choice. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Beckenbauer has said he will resign after the World Cup, turning over his 
job to longtime assistant Berti Vogts. Perhaps that will act as a spur to the 
players, who may want to win the World Cup for the man who captained his 
country to its last victory in 1974 and who came close as a coach in 1986, when 
West Germany finished second to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there is another incentive. This will be West Germany's last World 
Cup. By 1994, when the United States is the host nation, East and West will 
have reunited, and it will be simply Germany that takes the field. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer has assembled a strong squad, with the sheer physical power of the 
1982 and 1986 teams giving way to a team of more artistry. The midfield 
features a world-class lineup, with veteran Lothar Matthaeus and two 
exceptional youngsters, Thomas Haessler, 24, and Andreas Moeller, 22. On 
attack, Beckenbauer can call on Juergen Klinsmann, Rudi Voeller and Karlheinz 
Riedle. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Having finished second to Italy in 1982, and second again to 
Argentina in 1986, the West Germans think it is their turn to win it all. To 
see Beckenbauer become the first person to win the World Cup as a player and as 
a coach would not be a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Winner 1954, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Midfielder Thomas Haessler. 
</P>
<P>
ARGENTINA: If it were not for the genius of Diego Armando Maradona, Argentina 
could not be considered anything more than an also-ran. The defending world 
champion has failed miserably to live up to its title during the past four 
years, going 6-14-11 through May 1. One of the losses was to Australia, hardly 
a soccer power. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Carlos Bilardo's problems stem from the fact that after 1986 all the 
Argentine stars were snapped up by European clubs, leaving him to play with a 
second-string ensemble. The results were predictable. And even when Bilardo had 
access to his European players, as in the Copa America, or South American 
Championship, that they had not played together regularly made failure there 
inevitable, too. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has Bilardo developed any new stars. Argentina will be trying to defend its 
title with a recycled team. The only thing it has going for it is Maradona. 
Having won one World Cup illegally -- his hand-ball goal in the 1986 
quarterfinals in Mexico knocked out England and helped Argentina advance -- 
Maradona no doubt would like to win one legally. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: That Maradona is the world's finest player is without question. But 
even he cannot carry the entire team. For Argentina to advance beyond the 
quarterfinals, it may once again require the "hand of God." 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Winner, 1978, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Midfielder Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
THE NETHERLANDS: If soccer reporters around the world were to be polled, it is 
almost certain that the World Cup Final they would prefer to see July 8 in Rome 
would pit Brazil against Holland, South America's best against Europe's best. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team is led by the stars that took it to the 1988 European 
Championship: Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard. The three led 
their Italian team, A.C. Milan, to consecutive European Cup victories and the 
world club championship. 
</P>
<P>
But all is not calm in the Dutch camp. Unhappy with the way former coach Thijs 
Libregts forced them to play during the qualifying rounds, the players banded 
together to drive him out once the team had secured its berth in Italy. The man 
they wanted to succeed him was Barcelona Coach Johan Cruyff, the greatest Dutch 
player of all time. The man they got was Ajax Amsterdam Coach Leo Beenhakker. 
Once again, the players are less than thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, Gullit has been recovering from three knee surgeries in the past 11 
months and has seen little action in the past year. His doctor has pronounced 
him fit, however, which does not bode well for the Dutch team's opponents. Nor 
does the fact that of 104 soccer reporters worldwide polled by the Italian 
magazine Guerin Sportivo, 50 said Van Basten would be the tournament's leading 
goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: The Dutch people desperately want their team to bring home the World 
Cup that was denied them in 1974, when Holland, powered by Cruyff, fell to West 
Germany, 2-1, in a controversial Final at Munich and again in 1978 when the 
Netherlands was beaten by Argentina, 3-1, in the Final at Buenos Aires. The 
team might not disappoint them. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Runner-up, 1974, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Striker Marco Van Basten. 
</P>
<P>
ENGLAND: What the English had going for them until a couple of weeks ago was an 
unbeaten run of 19 matches in the past two years. Then they lost to Uruguay at 
Wembley and reality set in. A similar undefeated run before the European 
Championship in 1988 ended with a disastrous performance there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Coach Bobby Robson, who will leave his job to take over the Dutch team, 
PSV Eindhoven, after the World Cup, has a strong squad, and England has the 
ability to reach the last eight as it did in Mexico four years ago, before 
Maradona and his "hand of God" goal sank its hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Peter Shilton is 40, and if England advances to the second round in 
Italy, he will break the world record for appearances for a national team. 
Shilton has played 116 times for England and needs only three more matches to 
surpass Northern Ireland's Pat Jennings, who retired after the 1986 World Cup 
with 118 national team appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, England has Gary Lineker, who was the tournament's leading scorer in 
1986 with six goals, along with two of the best wingers in the world, John 
Barnes and Chris Waddle. Bryan Robson is England's captain and star midfielder 
but is 33 and prone to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Despite playing in a tough group with the Netherlands, Ireland and 
Egypt, England should reach the second round, but worries its loutish fans 
might spoil any subsequent success. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Winner, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Winger John Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: The Soviet team finished second in the European Championship in 
1988 and won the Olympic gold medal at Seoul that year. Those successes have 
prompted experts to consider it a serious candidate to win its first World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The team has two excellent goalkeepers in Rinat Dasayev and Viktor Chanov; top 
defenders such as Vladimir Bessonov and an excellent midfield that includes 
Sergei Aleinikov and Alexander Zavarov, both professionals with Italian Cup 
winner Juventus. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Valery Lobanovsky will be counting on Oleg Protasov to score the goals 
the Soviets need to overcome Argentina, Romania and Cameroon in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: The Soviets will be difficult to beat, but whether they have the 
flair to get past the quarterfinals will be the big test. A solid dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Fourth, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Forward Oleg Protasov. 
</P>
<P>
URUGUAY: For Uruguay, the last World Cup was a disaster. The team squandered 
the talents of such players as Enzo Francescoli and Ruben Paz and relied on 
brute force, rough play and negative tactics to survive. It failed and was 
eliminated early. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the two-time World Cup winner's best hopes lie once again in Francescoli 
and Paz, but newcomer Ruben Sosa, who plays for Lazio of Rome in Italy's Series 
A, will be the key if the team is to regain its reputation. The 23-year-old 
striker was brilliant in last year's South American Championship, in which 
Brazil beat Uruguay, 1-0, in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Uruguay is the longest shot among the top eight contenders, but 
cannot be entirely discounted because of players such as Sosa and Francescoli. 
A logical quarterfinalist at least. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Winner, 1930, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Forward Ruben Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
SPAIN: Some experts believe that the Spanish, not the Soviets, are the real 
dark horse and that in building a relatively young team, Coach Luis Suarez has 
made the correct decision. The key will be 26-year-old striker Emilio 
Butragueno, who scored five goals in the 1986 tournament and can inspire those 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: If Spain is to improve on its quarterfinal appearance in Mexico, 
strong performances will be needed from Butragueno, playmaker Michel and 
goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Fourth, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Striker Emilio Butragueno. 
</P>
<P>
BELGIUM: The Belgians surprised everyone by finishing fourth in 1986, losing to 
Argentina in the semifinals. The success was the work of Guy Thys, the most 
successful coach in the country's history. But Thys retired, and although 
Belgium qualified for Italy, it looked ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Thys has been lured out of retirement for one last charge, but it is 
doubtful the Belgians can match their performance of four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Fourth, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Michel Preud'Homme. 
</P>
<P>
SWEDEN: The Swedes have looked sharp in warmup games, including a 4-2 victory 
over Wales and a 6-0 rout of Finland, but will be meeting much tougher 
opposition, including Brazil and Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Coach Olle Nordin will rely on strikers Mats Magnusson and Stefan 
Pettersson to display the goal-scoring touch they showed for their club teams, 
Benfica of Portugal and Ajax Amsterdam of the Netherlands, respectively. A 
berth in the second round is quite possible for the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Runner-up, 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Defender Glenn Hysen. 
</P>
<P>
SCOTLAND: This is the Scots' fifth consecutive appearance in the tournament, 
but their stay might not be long. With Brazil and Sweden in the same 
first-round group, finishing third might be the best Coach Andy Roxburgh's team 
can do, and that might not get it into the next round. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: The team has problems with its defense and with consistency. It beat 
Argentina in a warmup, then inexplicably lost to Egypt. Which team will show up 
in Italy is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First round. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Forward Ally McCoist. 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: Making their first World Cup appearance since 1978, the Czechs 
are boosted by the political changes in Prague and the fact that the team is in 
a relatively weak group. Victories over the United States and Austria would see 
them through to the next round, regardless of what they do against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Czechoslovakia, which lost the 1934 World Cup Final to Italy and the 
1962 Final to Brazil, is a traditionally strong soccer country. But the only 
major success in the past two decades was a penalty-kick victory over West 
Germany in the final of the 1976 European Championship. The second round is as 
far as it can go this year. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Runner-up, 1934, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Ludek Miklosko. 
</P>
<P>
IRELAND: This is Ireland's first appearance in the tournament, but the team is 
led by a man who already has won the World Cup. Coach Jack Charlton, brother of 
Bobby Charlton, was a member of England's winning team in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Under Charlton, Ireland has become one of the best teams in Europe 
and even beat England in the 1988 European Championship. The luck of the draw 
has not been kind, however, and the Irish will have to get by England again, as 
well as The Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Pat Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
AUSTRIA: The Austrians are considered the most likely to yield a point or two 
to the United States -- or at least they were until recently, when they beat 
Spain, Hungary and The Netherlands and tied Argentina. Now the United States 
will have to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Strikers Toni Polster and Gerhard Rodax scored 67 goals between them 
for their club teams this season, with Rodax finishing second only to Hugo 
Sanchez of Real Madrid as Europe's top scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Third, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Striker Toni Polster. 
</P>
<P>
YUGOSLAVIA: The Yugoslavs' best hope is to finish second in its first-round 
group to West Germany. Whether they do will depend on their match against 
Colombia, which is Coach Ivan Osim's big worry. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: A victory over the Colombians probably would put Yugoslavia into the 
second round because it should have little trouble beating the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Fourth, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Midfielder Dragan Stojkovic. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH KOREA: Making their second consecutive World Cup appearance, the South 
Koreans are the best team ever to come out of Asia, but they were drawn into a 
brutal first-round group with Belgium, Spain and Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: If the lessons of 1986 were learned, South Korea could hold its own. 
In Mexico, it proved that it had come of age by matching then-defending 
champion Italy stride for stride before eventually losing, 3-2. South Korea 
wants to stage the World Cup in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First round. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Winger Joo-sung Kim. 
</P>
<P>
CAMEROON: In Cameroon's previous World Cup appearance eight years ago in Spain, 
only a single goal allowed eventual winner Italy to advance from the first 
round in place of Cameroon, which tied all three of its matches but still was 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Cameroon has the ability to become the Brazil of Africa, especially 
when strengthened by its European-based players, but it self-destructed earlier 
this year and lost its African championship. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First round. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell. 
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIA: Death threats and drug cartels back in Bogota have not deterred the 
Colombians and Coach Francisco Maturana, from believing they can be one of the 
surprise teams of 1990. Maturana is confident the team will advance to the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Whether Colombia advances will depend in large measure on flamboyant 
goalkeeper Rene Higuita, whose fondness for wandering far upfield could be 
punished at this level of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First round. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Rene Higuita. 
</P>
<P>
EGYPT: Until a week or two ago, the Egyptians were being taken very lightly by 
their first-round foes -- England, Ireland and The Netherlands. Then Egypt beat 
the Scots in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: This is Egypt's first World Cup appearance in 56 years -- the last 
also being in Italy, in 1934. It has no real hope of advancing. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First round. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Ahmed Shobeir. 
</P>
<P>
ROMANIA: The key to Romania's success will be whether the players' minds will 
be on the tournament or on the tumultuous changes ocurring in their country 
since the December overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Gheorghe Hagi, nicknamed "the Maradona of the Carpathians," was 
recently signed to a lucrative contract by Spanish champion Real Madrid and 
will be the key to Romania's success. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First round. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
COSTA RICA: The Costa Ricans won the North and Central American and Caribbean 
(CONCACAF) qualifying group, finishing ahead of the United States, but have not 
had the financial resources to prepare properly for the type of opponents they 
will face in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Yugoslav Coach Bora Milutinovic, who replaced fired former coach 
Marvin Rodriguez in March, led Mexico into the quarterfinals of the 1986 World 
Cup. But Costa Rica has to play Brazil, Sweden and Scotland in the first round, 
and even Milutinovic can't work that big a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Forward Hernan Medford. 
</P>
<P>
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: After having reached Italy against all odds by upsetting 
China in qualifying play, the U.A.E. team has been beset by problems. Two 
coaches have been dismissed, and the third, Brazilian Carlos Alberto, has a fat 
contract but a slim chance of getting the team through the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: The inspiration for the Arabs in the qualifying rounds was then-coach 
Mario Zagalo, a three-time World Cup winner with Brazil -- twice as a player 
and once as coach. When he was fired in a political dispute with the U.A.E. 
soccer federation, the team lost any chance it might have had. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Forward Adnan Khamees Al Talyani. 
</P>
<P>
UNITED STATES: Making their first appearance in the World Cup tournament in 40 
years, the Americans are given little chance of even scoring. If they can avoid 
being humiliated by their first-round opponents -- Czechoslovakia, Italy and 
Austria -- that will be sufficient cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Synopsis: Canada didn't win a game or score a goal in 1986, either, but its 
players left Mexico with heads held high because of the tenacity of their play 
against equally formidable opponents. The U.S. team can only hope to do as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Best Finish: Semifinalist, 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Player to Watch: Goalkeeper Tony Meola.

DAMEWORTH, DROSSIN PUT THE DOUBTS TO REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between them, they had won five state Division I titles in cross-country, but 
Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin of Agoura High entered Saturday night's state 
track and field championships at Cerritos College in Norwalk with something to 
prove. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the honors bestowed on them for running over hill and dale during 
the fall, neither had won a state title on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, the 1989 Kinney national cross-country champion, had come close last 
year, finishing second to David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit in the 3,200 meters, 
yet he and Drossin entered this year's state championship with a reputation for 
failing to win crucial track events. 
</P>
<P>
As of 8 p.m. Saturday, that image had been washed away as Dameworth followed 
Drossin's victory in the girls' 3,200 with a win of his own in the boys' race. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes after Drossin had run a personal-best and state-leading time of 10 
minutes 29.60 seconds, Dameworth toed the starting line and proceeded to reel 
off a personal-best and nation-leading time of 8:53.26. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of have mixed emotions right now," said Dameworth, whose previous best 
was 8:53.85. "It means a lot to me that I finally won a state track title, but 
I'm kind of disturbed. I wanted to run a lot faster time. . . . I was hoping to 
run the first 800 in 2:11 and the first (1,600) in 4:21 or 4:22, but that was 
shot from the start when no one else wanted to lead for the first two laps." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth in effect led from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Hernandez of Mar Vista briefly took the lead during the fifth lap, but 
Dameworth dictated the pace. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger senior passed the first 800 meters in 2:15.2 and 1,600 meters in 
4:27.8 with Eliazar Herrera of Hoover, Angel Martinez of San Gabriel, Abe 
Valdez of Camarillo, Obed Aguirre of San Fernando and Hernandez close behind. 
</P>
<P>
A 2:14.9 for the third 800 brought Dameworth through 2,400 meters in 6:42.7 and 
opened a gap over everyone except Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know who it was, but I could feel someone close to me with two laps 
to go," said Dameworth, winner of the past three state Division I cross-country 
titles. "I was pretty nervous." 
</P>
<P>
That anxiety ceased shortly afterward as Dameworth broke away from Herrera with 
600 meters left while running his final 800 in 2:10.6. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera (8:58.97), James Menon (8:59.05) of San Luis Obispo and Aguirre 
(9:01.11) all recorded personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
Like Dameworth, Drossin is not known for a blistering last lap, and she had no 
intention of letting her race develop into a kicker's affair. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was to go with three laps left and that's what I did," said Drossin, 
who won state Division I cross-country titles in 1987 and '89 and placed third 
in '88. 
</P>
<P>
But even Drossin, a junior, was shocked at how well her plan worked. 
</P>
<P>
After Martha Pinto of Anaheim Katella led through the 1,600 in 5:19.9, Drossin 
bolted into the lead with 1,000 meters remaining and was never challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Running the last 1,600 in 5:09.7, Drossin defeated runner-up Pinto by nearly 13 
seconds.

MATADORS: JACKSONVILLE STATE RALLIES FROM A 6-1 DEFICIT WITH THE AID OF A KEY 
HIT BATSMAN TO POST A 12-8 VICTORY IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Clayton summed up the situation succinctly: 
</P>
<P>
"You hit a guy on a one-two pitch and bad things happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A three-run home run by Merritt Bowden was officially the game-winning hit of 
the NCAA Division II championship baseball game Saturday at Paterson Field. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, his teammates and coaches know better. 
</P>
<P>
Jacksonville (Ala.) State, which defeated Northridge, 12-8, did not deliver the 
most important hit of all. The Gamecocks received it. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Roberts, a strikeout victim in his previous two at-bats, had two strikes 
on him with two out in the sixth inning. It was then that Clayton plunked him 
in the side with a curveball that didn't curve. 
</P>
<P>
The next pitch, another curve, was personally straightened out by Bowden. It 
landed well over the fence in right-center field for his 12th, and most timely, 
home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bowden's three-run blast broke a 6-6 tie and reliever Craig Holman made it 
stand up as Jacksonville State (43-9) won its first Division II baseball title 
in six tries, before a highly partisan crowd of 3,593. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the biggest play of the game," said Coach Bill Kernen, whose 
Northridge team finished 39-22. "We had him struck out before on two balls 
away. We were trying to drop down and throw a breaking ball away and instead it 
hits him." 
</P>
<P>
Jacksonville State, which had taken the lead in its 10 previous postseason 
victories, was forced to play catch-up in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge scored three times in both the second and third innings to take a 
6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sims and Clayton had run-producing singles in the second inning. The 
Matadors scored their final run of the inning when Eric Johnson was hit by a 
pitch with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, who finished with three hits and five runs batted in, accounted for 
all of CSUN's runs in the third with his 12th home run, a three-run shot to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Scott Sharts, however, could not hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Heath Garman made the score 6-3 with a two-run homer in the fourth inning, and 
the Gamecocks pulled to within a run on another two-run homer, this one by Todd 
Mixon in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't pitch the game I wanted to, the way I'm capable of," said 
Sharts, who lost for the third time in nine decisions. "I was throwing stuff 
right in their zones." 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Sharts was chased by a two-out, run-scoring triple by Mark Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, who had not pitched in more than two weeks, came on and immediately 
jumped ahead on the count before hitting Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the home runs that killed us," Clayton said. "It was the guys we let 
on base. They took advantage of our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Jacksonville State added three more runs in the seventh on two doubles, a 
single and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
Holman (8-0), pitching in relief of starter Todd Altaffer, earned his 20th 
collegiate victory in 21 decisions. He allowed seven hits and two earned runs 
in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts accounted for one of those runs when he blasted his 29th home run of the 
season in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge pushed across another run in the seventh but left the bases loaded 
for the second time in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton's two-out single, his school-record 106th hit of the season, drove in 
Andy Hodgins. Greg Shockey followed with a one-hopper down the left-field line 
for a single, bringing up Sharts. 
</P>
<P>
Working carefully with a base open, Holman walked Sharts on five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
However, Holman pitched out of the jam by inducing Johnson to ground to 
shortstop Scott Sprick, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge outhit Jacksonville, 13-12, but the Matadors stranded 13 runners. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team," Kernen said of Jacksonville State. "They outplayed us in 
pretty much every part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept coming at them, but it wasn't enough. To beat us when we're giving 
everything we got takes a special effort. You win national championships with 
those kind of efforts, so they deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, Clayton and shortstop Mike Solar were selected to the all-tournament 
team. Sharts was seven for 23 in CSUN's four games, with four home runs and 13 
runs batted in. Clayton was 11 for 21 with two homers and 10 RBIs. Solar was 
seven for 16 with three homers and eight RBIs. Tim Vanegmond, a Jacksonville 
State pitcher, was the most valuable player. Vanegmond warmed up several times 
during the title game but was not needed. He had a shutout and two saves in the 
Gamecocks' other World Series wins. . . . Clayton's seventh-inning single broke 
the Northridge record for hits in a season. Rondal Rollin had 105 in 1980. . . 
. Jacksonville entered the game with 117 stolen bases, but the Gamecocks swiped 
only one in two tries against CSUN's Sims. In the fifth inning, Jacksonville 
State's Adams was thrown out stealing for only the third time in 30 attempts. . 
. . Dave Weatherman, CSUN's pitching coach, was ejected in the seventh inning 
by Tony Maners, the second-base umpire and crew chief. Weatherman had been 
badgering Dick Urlage, the plate umpire, about the strike zone. . . . There 
were six hit batters -- three by Altaffer and one each by Holman, Sharts and 
Clayton. . . . Northridge is scheduled to arrive at LAX at 6:20 p.m. today on 
Delta Airlines Flight No. 82.

RIO MESA COACH'S SILENT TREATMENT HELPS YOUNG ENJOY BIG YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes it's better for a coach to stand back and watch. Intervention, 
suggestion and criticism are tools that should be used judiciously. 
</P>
<P>
If Rio Mesa High Coach Rich Duran has learned anything while coaching teen 
phenom Dmitri Young over the past three seasons, it is to give his player free 
rein. Young, who just concluded his junior year, has followed through with an 
offensive reign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
In short, if it ain't broke. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't coach him," Duran said. "I just let him play." 
</P>
<P>
Duran's hands-off style has paid off handsomely. Young has moved within 
striking range of a handful of Southern Section career records. In three 
varsity seasons, Young is 125 for 246 (.508), has 28 doubles and 18 home runs, 
has scored 99 runs and driven in 96. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section career record for hits (147) was set by Redondo High's 
Scott Davison in 1986-88. If Young matches his 1990 total of 50, he will finish 
with 175. 
</P>
<P>
The Section career mark for doubles (36) was set by Danny Paranick of Mammoth 
in 1986-89. Young, who had 14 doubles this season, needs eight to tie. 
</P>
<P>
With 99 runs, Young is well behind the Section career mark of 142 set by Torey 
Lovullo (UCLA, Detroit Tigers) of Montclair Prep in 1980-83. But if Young can 
match this season's eye-popping run total of 46, he also will break that 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Davison's career mark for runs batted in (147) appears to be outside Young's 
range, but Young drove in 39 as a junior, so don't rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
Young needs just three home runs to reach 21, which would move him into the 
section top 10. The section career mark of 32 set by Scott Sharts of Simi 
Valley in 1986-88 might be asking a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if Young -- who is only 16 -- had attended junior high in California, he 
might already have demolished the record book. He played for the varsity in the 
seventh and eight grades while living in Alabama and batted better than .400 
both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Stand tall, coach. 
</P>
<P>
And stand back. 
</P>
<P>
Kiss of death: So you think the Sports Illustrated jinx is a killer? There are 
some local baseball folks who would argue that the alleged curse of SI has 
nothing on the mojo cast by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1986, Simi Valley was ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today but fell in 
the semifinal round of the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1988, Chatsworth was ranked No. 1 by USA Today, but was upset by San 
Fernando in the City Section 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1990, Westlake's fate might have been sealed when, for the first time all 
year, USA Today ranked the Warriors No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Uh, thanks. 
</P>
<P>
The issue hit the stands just in time for Tuesday's Southern Section 5-A 
semifinal game with Marina, which Westlake lost, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Three top-ranked Valley-area teams bite the dust in the semifinals, all 
in even-numbered years. Some would call it odd, even. 
</P>
<P>
Loud and proud: Nobody really knows who uttered it first, but Mark Spitz, Jimmy 
Connors and Bill Johnson are among the more recent exponents of the belief that 
"It ain't bragging if you can back it up." 
</P>
<P>
All season long, Montclair Prep Coach Walt Steele has been unabashedly singing 
the praises of his team, which capped a superlative season with a 14-4 defeat 
of Village Christian in the Southern Section 1-A title game Friday night. The 
Mounties defeated some heavy hitters along the way, including City 4-A finalist 
El Camino Real in a tournament game 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
This was not overlooked by Steele, who reiterated after the championship game 
that he believes Montclair Prep consistently is slighted because of the 
division in which it plays. Conversely, many maintain that the 1-A Division is 
not competitive enough for the men of Steele, that Montclair Prep has made a 
Mountie domain out of a molehill. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there are many teams who played the caliber of clubs that we did 
this year and go 25-3," Steele said. "I've said all along that we deserve to be 
here and that we deserved to win. That's still my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Add confidence: Rocky Moore, who last week announced he will leave Alemany to 
coach basketball at Muir, has some lofty expectations for the Mustang program, 
which competes in the Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
"Muir is a higher caliber of program with much more visibility, and it's 
obvious that Alemany has not been known for its basketball program," Moore 
said. "It's a difference of night and day. You're talking about a program that 
can be built up like Crenshaw, Manual Arts or Mater Dei." 
</P>
<P>
In two seasons under Moore, Alemany was 12-33. The losing record, Moore says, 
weighed little in Muir's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration had confidence based on my reputation in the coaching 
fraternity, not based on my win-loss record," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ouch: The nature of Village Christian's lopsided loss to Montclair Prep caused 
some brief confusion among Southern Section officials in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard at Blair Field in Long Beach could not handle double-digit 
totals in errors. Village Christian committed 10 miscues, the last of which was 
made in the seventh inning. The scoreboard was first rolled over to 1, then 
back to 9. 
</P>
<P>
Add playoffs: San Fernando Coach Steve Marden was thrust into a difficult 
situation in a May 23 City 4-A quarterfinal win over Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
With starter Canto Franco barely clinging to a 4-3 lead and two baserunners on 
in the fourth, Marden had to call in ace John Najar to thwart Kennedy for the 
final 3 1/3 innings. Najar did, of course, and the Tigers advanced to the 
semifinal round with a 7-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
But Marden's hand was tipped after that. He had planned to start Najar, his 
best, against El Camino Real in the semifinal. But Najar had thrown earlier and 
longer than anticipated, leaving the coach with a decision: Should he start 
Najar in the hope that he can go the distance, risking the loss of Najar's big 
bat if he must be removed? Or should he start Franco and hope he can hold the 
fort for a few innings before going to Najar? 
</P>
<P>
To Marden, there was no choice. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get by Kennedy on Wednesday or else you're reading about somebody 
else in Friday's paper," Marden said. "When we (used both pitchers), we knew we 
had to go to a combination against El Camino. And the only combination we can 
use is start Franco, with Najar DH-ing for him. If we go the reverse and Johnny 
can't go the whole way, then we lose Najar's bat." 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 3-1 loss to El Camino Real, Najar was almost untouchable, 
allowing no hits while striking out five in four innings of relief. Franco, who 
started, yielded all three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just hoping Franco could go the distance on Wednesday (against 
Kennedy)," Marden said. "But he didn't. So if we rest Najar on Wednesday, then 
he might be resting for the whole year. Maybe then we would have been reading 
about ECR-Kennedy in the semifinals."

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WEST SCORES 11-1 VICTORY IN ITS OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With many of its players showing little effect from their disappointing loss in 
the City Section 4-A Division championship game Wednesday night, Woodland Hills 
West pounded out 15 hits Saturday to defeat Encino-Crespi, 11-1, in an American 
Legion District 20 game at El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
The game was called after seven innings because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of its roster is composed of El Camino Real players, 
Woodland Hills West nonetheless rocked four Encino-Crespi pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are much more resilient than adults," Woodland Hills Coach Don Hornback 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Jason Cohen led the way with a single, double, triple and six runs 
batted in. Chris Teich added two singles and double for West (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Joey Rosselli (1-0) pitched five innings, allowed two hits, struck 
out 10 and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills East 14, Granada Hills 3 -- Eric Rothman (1-0) threw a 
three-hitter, struck out eight and walked three to lead Woodland Hills East in 
a game at Taft that was called after seven innings because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Zeichick was two for four and drove in five runs for East (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 9, Agoura 4 -- Jared Baumblatt, Leo Tejada and Tuti Rodriguez each 
doubled to key host Reseda's 10-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Yeomans (1-0) and Louis Vanacore combined to limit Agoura (2-1) to eight 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock 6, Studio City 5 -- Eagle Rock pitcher Jason Armanderiz hit a 
two-run home run with one out in the bottom of the eighth to help give himself 
the win at Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Armanderiz (1-1) pitched two complete innings of relief and then yielded in the 
ninth to Brian Esquival, who earned his first save when he pitched a scoreless 
inning after entering with two on and none out. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock is 1-2; Studio City is 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 5, Las Virgenes 0 -- Chatsworth left-hander Danny Rodriguez struck 
out seven and walked three in a seven-inning complete game at Las Virgenes. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez (1-0) scattered eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo 14, Conejo Valley 11 -- The teams combined for 31 hits, including 
eight doubles, at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (1-0) led, 6-0, after one inning and never trailed. Ken Knight (four 
for four with two doubles) and Jim Tackett (three for four with a double) led 
the Camarillo attack. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley 11, Panorama City 2 -- Right-hander Raul Torres (1-0) threw a 
complete game, and Robert Aros had three hits, including a solo homer in the 
sixth, for visiting Sun Valley in its opener. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DISTRICT 16 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster 5, Newhall-Saugus 4 (13 innings) -- Deadlocked 2-2 after 12 innings, 
Lancaster and Newhall-Saugus surpassed their previous offensive output with a 
high-scoring 13th. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Newhall-Saugus took a 4-2 lead in the top of the inning and Lancaster 
(2-0) answered with three runs in its final at-bat.

WOODSIDE RIDES EARLY BREAK TO HIS 1ST SPORTSMAN MAIN WIN AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three consecutive weeks at Saugus Speedway, the driver who started the 
Sportsman Division main event in the pole position had led all the way. 
</P>
<P>
That pattern changed Saturday night in front of 3,528. 
</P>
<P>
This time the pole-sitter, Tom Eurton of Valencia, couldn't finish the first 
lap, pulling into the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Woodside of Saugus, starting in the same row as Eurton on the outside, 
led the rest of the way for his first Sportsman main-event win at Saugus. 
Woodside, who entered the night 11th in the points standings, held off repeated 
charges from Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, who is third in points. 
</P>
<P>
So, all it takes to win is having a choice starting position? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, and experience," said Woodside, competing in his first full year at 
Saugus at the Sportsman level. "Plus Dave Phipps is a good enough driver that 
he wasn't going to push me out of the way. He could have several times." 
</P>
<P>
Phipps finished second, followed by Keith Spangler of Northridge and John Cran 
of Reseda. Brian Kelly of Arleta, who is not among the points leaders, passed 
Arnold Fagan of Palmdale on Lap 10 and held on to win the 25-lap Street Stock 
main event. 
</P>
<P>
Eurton won the 15-lap, figure-eight main event. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Blankenship of Reseda, who had the fastest qualifying time, put in a solid 
performance, starting in the 14th position and finishing second. John Kirby of 
Ventura finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Yamada of North Hollywood won the 12-lap Mini Stock event, taking the 
lead on Lap 2. Rudo Sandoval of Van Nuys finished second, followed by Rock Ake 
of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Staubs of Littlerock won the 15-lap Street Stock semi-main event, passing 
Jeff Harris of Thousand Oaks on the second lap. Also advancing to the main 
event were Rick Winakur of San Gabriel, Craig Jensen of Sunland and Brian 
Polzin of Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy-dash winners included John Covan of Simi Valley (Sportsman), Blankenship 
(Street Stock), Sandoval (Mini Stock) and Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley (figure 
eight). 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Thompson of Sylmar won two Street Stock heat races. Other heat-race 
winners included: Phipps and Herb Hill of Simi Valley, and Steve Burdett of 
Canyon Country (Sportsman); Greg Benner of Whittier, Ray Mood of Granada Hills 
and John Lindley Jr. of Sylmar (Street Stock); Larry Durm of Northridge 
(figure-eight).

Marina High School of Huntington Beach scored on an error in the bottom of the 
ninth inning for a 1-0 victory and the Southern Section 5-A softball 
championship at Mayfair Park in Lakewood Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Christa Yorke led off with single, went to second base on a groundball 
and took third on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Miyahara hit a shot to center fielder Erin Mutch, who dropped the ball, 
allowing Yorke to score. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's Miyahara (16-1) got the victory as the Vikings improved to 28-5. 
Newbury Park ended the season 24-8. 
</P>
<P>
Outstanding defensive plays by both teams prevented runs from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's Lynn Anderson ripped a high liner up the middle with two on base 
in the fifth inning, but second baseman Julie Muche made a running back hand 
overhead stab to save a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Melody Bolger's running catch saved a Marina run in the fifth inning. DONNA

Mike Sulcer of Pasadena Muir knew the Mustangs needed to finish in at least 
second place in the 1,600-meter relay to win the boys' state track and field 
team title Saturday night before 10,470 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Sulcer, who ran the anchor leg, already had scored 10 points for Muir by 
winning the 400 meters, but the Mustangs' 14 points trailed first-place 
Lompoc's 20 going into the meet's final event. 
</P>
<P>
But Muir won its fifth boys' state championship with 24 points by winning the 
1,600-meter relay in 3:14.00. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the last quarter of the season and we had to take first in an event we 
take pride and joy in," said Sulcer, who ran a 46.9-second anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
Muir's relay team's effort offset an outstanding meet by Lompoc's Napoleon 
Kaufman, who accounted for all of the Braves' points. Kaufman, a junior, won 
the 100 meters in 10.57 seconds and the 200 in 21.15. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, behind Curtis Hawkins' victory in the 110-meter high hurdles in 14.41 
seconds and the Colts' runner-up 400-meter relay team, finished tied with 
Fallbrook for third place with 18 points. Brent Noon, the state shotput 
record-holder, scored all of Fallbrook's points by winning the shotput (74 feet 
4 3/4 inches) and finishing second in the discus (200-8). 
</P>
<P>
City champion Washington, a pre-meet favorite, finished out of the running when 
two-time City sprint champ Donovan Burks suffered a hamstring injury in 
Friday's preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to win a state championship the last two years, Coley Candaele of 
Carpinteria outdueled Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande in the 1,600 meters to 
win his first title in 4:06.26. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana tried to combat Candaele's strong finishing kick by quickening the 
pace after 800 meters, but that tactic failed when Candaele took the lead with 
300 meters remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"(Quintana) had to run a race like that, but I was not going to let this one 
slip away," Candaele said, who finished out of the running in the 800-meter 
final one hour later. "The 1,600 took a lot out of me for the 800, but I had to 
get at least one title." 
</P>
<P>
Competition for the girls' team title was basically over one hour into the 
meet, as Bakersfield finished 1-2 in the shotput and then won the 400-meter 
relay to score a quick 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield finished with 61 points to Inglewood Morningside's 30. The bulk of 
Bakersfield's scoring came in the shotput and discus, with Dawn Dumble and 
Melisa Weis accounting for 18 points each. Sophomore Janice Nichols won the 400 
meters in 53.89 seconds, fastest time in the nation by a high school girl this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Marion Jones of Oxnard Rio Mesa easily won the 100 and 200 meters in 
11.67 and 23.71, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Defending state champions, Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica and Juliana Yendork 
of Walnut, joined Jones as double-event winners. 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb won the 100-meter low hurdles for the second consecutive year in a 
national best of 13.58, and then won the 300-meter hurdles by defeating last 
year's champion, Twila Sims of Lompoc, 41.69 to 41.76, also a national best. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork, a junior, won the long and triple jumps for the second year in a row 
with leaps of 20-1 1/2 and 42-0 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Toney of Atascadero defended her state title in the 800 meters by winning 
in 2:06.13, also a national best this season.

LINDSEY'S HIT GIVES MARINA 5-A TITLE

Robin Lindsey's two-run single in the top of the seventh inning gave Marina 
High School of Huntington Beach a 6-4 victory over Diamond Bar and the Southern 
Section 5-A baseball title Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Southern Section baseball for Marina (17-12-1), which entered 
the playoffs as the third-place team from the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey's single came on a full-count pitch with runners on second and third 
and two out. He was jammed slightly by the pitch but managed to hit it into 
right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fastball," he said. "I knew it would score two runs when I hit it and 
there is no better feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Brain Hegerty (6-3) took the loss in relief and Sean Connors (3-3) got the 
victory, also in relief. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar errors allowed Marina to score three runs in the third to take a 
4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Newfield hit a two-out grounder that went through the legs of third 
baseman Jim Doyle, scoring a run to tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
David Schultz hit a two-hopper to shortstop Tito Quiles, who fumbled the ball 
and then threw wildly to first, allowing Lindsey to score. Newfield took third 
while Diamond Bar first baseman Tommy Thompson ran down the errant throw. 
Newfield took too big a turn at third, but when Thompson threw behind him, 
Newfield beat the throw home. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar (21-9) came back to it, 4-4, in the bottom of the third. Doyle 
reached second on a throwing error by third baseman Chad Terry and Jeff Turley 
followed with a two-run home run to the right of the 362-foot sign in left 
field. STEVE KRESAL

El Toro 1, Don Lugo 0 -- Jamie Smith drove in the game's only run in the bottom 
of the eighth inning, giving El Toro the Southern Section 3-A softball 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs, Smith beat the throw from Chino Don Lugo shortstop Michelle 
Macias, allowing Corrie Yauney to score a run that was set up by several 
umpiring calls questioned by Don Lugo Coach Ray Sheffield. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield argued that Kymm Maniscalco, who began the decisive eighth inning 
with an infield single, was out at first base by a full step. Yauney then 
forced Maniscalco at second base. Sheffield again argued when Karie Yoshioka 
was called safe on an infield single on which Yauney went to third during the 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Paige Lauby was the winning pitcher, giving up four hits, striking out 12 and 
walking one. Agoura 4, Paraclete 0 -- Michelle Ray and Kim Bunch singled and 
scored in a three-run third inning that powered the Chargers (23-5) to the 
Southern Section Division 1-A championship.

JACK TAYLOR MEMORIAL ALL-STAR GAME; 
</P>
<P>
COACHES WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TALENT TONIGHT 
</P>

Frank Chambliss coached Torrey Pines High School's baseball team to the 2-A 
championship in the Lions Tournament this season. But his team also finished 
last in the eight-team Palomar League. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 tonight at San Diego State, Chambliss will be loaded with talent. He and 
assistant Jerry Schneipp of Helix will call the shots for the 3-A team when it 
plays the 2-A in the Jack Taylor Memorial All-Star Game. The game is sponsored 
by the San Diego County Baseball Coaches Association, which selected the 
players and the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
With all the talented seniors on the field, Chambliss could have a tough time 
making decisions. When he makes a pitching change, should he bring in Orange 
Glen left-hander Scott Coleman, who set a section record with 16 consecutive 
no-hit innings earlier this season, or Mt. Carmel left-hander Doug Hill, who 
compiled a two-year record of 18-2? 
</P>
<P>
And there's always Poway's Danny Miller, who was 12-1 with a 1.22 earned-run 
average and 123 strikeouts in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of decisions facing Chambliss and the coach in the other 
dugout, Santana's Jim Saska, who will get advice from assistants Ron Smock of 
Coronado and Ron Lopez of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the high-profile stars, the game affords the public the 
opportunity to see players they normally wouldn't, such as Julian's Travis 
Denmark, who hit 13 home runs, drove in 42 runs and pitched his team to the 1-A 
championship, and Christian's Tony Clark, who hit 11 home runs for the Harbor 
League's last-place Patriots and is expected to be among the first players 
taken in Monday's free agent draft. They will compete for the 2-A. 
</P>
<P>
Rosters 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to play for the 3-A team are Patrick Henry's Scott Arlin, Torrey 
Pines' Preston Bynes and Shaw Henderson, Point Loma's Brett Callan, Hilltop's 
David Chapman, Orange Glen's Scott Coleman, Granite Hills' John Fenn, San 
Dieguito's Mike Henry, Mt. Carmel's Doug Hill and Andy Panganiban, Helix's Rob 
Ippolito and Eric Nicholson, Serra's Sean Kerr, Mount Miguel's Joe Mata, El 
Capitan's Sid Melero and David Rios, Sweetwater's Larry Mesa, Mike Romero and 
Paul Sanchez, Poway's Danny Miller, Matt Schwenke and Greg Sorrell, Mar Vista's 
Vern Mullis, Monte Vista's Ernie Reyes, and Rancho Buena Vista's David Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to compete for the 2-A team are Oceanside's Andy Acevedo, Escondido's 
Tom Afenir, Lincoln's Donald Anderson, Christian's Tony Clark, Julian's Travis 
Denmark, USDHS' Jeff Desjardins and Gary Remiker, Grossmont's Jim Early and 
John Tatum, Coronado's Jason Fledderjohn, Santana's Ferdie Hollis and Lance 
McClure, University City's Troy Lane, Valhalla's Scott Lapinski, Grossmont's 
Greg Layson, Mission Bay's Mike Lowry, Crawford's Joe McWilliams, El Camino's 
Ricky Spears, and San Diego's Josh Stepner.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: DAY FOR SMALL-COMPANY STOCKS MAY BE NEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like Dust Bowl farmers, investors in small-company mutual funds have been 
waiting for their own drought to end. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, there have been signs that the long dry spell could be breaking. But 
many investors seem reluctant to jump on the bandwagon just yet, considering 
that there have been other false signals in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
During much of the 1980s, mutual funds that invest in smaller corporations 
assumed the unfamiliar role of laggards. As a group, they posted an average 
total return of roughly 64% over the five years ending March 31, according to 
Lipper Analytical Services. That's well below the 92% increase for equity funds 
in general over the same period. This sort of under-performance is unusual 
because small-company shares typically appreciate at an above-average rate. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this potential, investors usually have been willing to pay "growth 
premiums" for small stocks in the form of higher price/earnings multiples. But 
no more. 
</P>
<P>
The T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, considered a proxy for the small-company 
market, in late March sported a P/E of 14.8 -- the same as for Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index, a blue-chip bellwether. Only one other time in the past 
30 years has New Horizon's relative P/E fallen this low, says Kenneth D. 
Waggoner, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price in Los Angeles. Usually, the fund's 
multiple hovers at about 1 1/2 times that of the S&amp;P 500, and occasionally 
it has exceeded 2 times. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, small-stock enthusiasts have been buoyed by indications that the tide 
could be turning. Since mid-May, the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite index 
has risen more than the S&amp;P 500. Concurrently, the NASDAQ index pushed 
above its 200-day moving average for the first time in three months -- a 
bullish factor in the minds of many market watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Small-company funds typically don't invest in truly tiny corporations but 
rather in OTC firms whose shares outstanding are worth $200 million to $400 
million or so. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean stock market momentum is rotating away from the blue chips? The 
people who run leading small-company mutual funds disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Cotner, portfolio manager of the Kemper Summit Fund in Chicago, isn't 
convinced that the rally of the past few weeks suggests a new trend of better 
performance for small issues. "Most of the recent strength in the 
over-the-counter market has been related to technology stocks," Cotner says. 
She's awaiting an upsurge involving many industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Barry, one of three portfolio managers for the Alliance Quasar Fund 
in New York, believes that the rally has been broad enough to suggest that a 
turning point is near. "We're in the process of bottoming on small stocks," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Royce, who has run the Pennsylvania Mutual Fund for the past 17 years, 
agrees. "This is definitely the beginning of something," he declares. Given the 
relative strength of large stocks from 1984 on, Royce believes that the law of 
averages are on his side. "Small companies outperform on a cumulative basis 
over long periods," he says. "That's been true for most 10-year periods and all 
15-year periods" dating to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
What would it take for small stocks to emerge again as market leaders? For 
starters, investors as a group would have to show a preference for earnings 
growth rather than "values." In other words, they would have to place a premium 
on companies with superior profit potential rather than undervalued assets. If 
the decline in takeover activity since last fall is an indication, this might 
be happening. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the public would have to get excited about stocks again. Individuals tend 
to be the most significant buyers of many smaller issues, simply because banks, 
pension funds, mutual funds and other institutional investors can't. 
"Institutions have so much money to invest, they have to buy large companies so 
as not to disrupt a stock's price," explains Geraldine Weiss, publisher of 
Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
However, many people are reluctant to buy stocks, given the greater perceived 
volatility of recent years. For small issues to outperform bigger ones, "you 
would need individuals to come back into the market in greater numbers," Weiss 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Add purchases by foreign investors, who tend to prefer large U.S. companies 
with which they're familiar, and you can see why blue chips have been in vogue 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss predicts that more smaller investors will return to the stock market. But 
she believes that the change will be gradual, perhaps stretching out over 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
In general, small-stock funds are considered to be more risky than the average 
equity portfolio because the issues they hold are more erratic. Consider, for 
example, the recent volatility of Adobe Systems Inc. When the computer software 
firm announced lower-than-expected earnings May 24, Adobe's stock the next day 
tumbled more than $15 a share to close at $35.25. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, mutual funds typically hold dozens if not hundreds of issues, so 
they can absorb steep drops in individual stocks. Even so, there will be bumps 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
To put the long-term averages to work in your favor, Royce recommends holding a 
small-company fund for many years and purchasing shares by "dollar cost 
averaging." This way, you invest a set dollar amount in a fund each month, with 
the result that you tend to buy fewer shares when prices are high and more 
shares when prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you don't have a long-term horizon or simply can't stomach much 
volatility? Walter Rouleau, publisher of the Growth Fund Guide newsletter in 
Rapid City, S.D., suggests that you determine, at the time you invest, how big 
a loss you're willing to accept -- say, 10%. If the fund declines by that 
magnitude, you sell. If the fund rises after you buy, you simply move up your 
sell point so that it stays 10% below the current price. 
</P>
<P>
This loss-limiting method has drawbacks. It implies that you will never sell at 
a top price. Also, it requires discipline on your part. On the other hand, 
following this approach could save you from a portfolio-shattering drop. "If 
the market gets hit hard, some small-stock funds will take it on the chin," 
Rouleau says. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, blue-chip stocks can also fall sharply, which is why Waggoner 
recommends holding more than one type of equity portfolio. "Two separate 
markets seem to have emerged -- one for institutions and one for individuals," 
he says. "That implies that you could get some diversification benefit from 
holding a blue-chip fund along with a small-company fund." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEADING SMALL-COMPANY FUNDS 
</P>
<P>
While smaller stocks can be quite volatile over the short term, they tend to 
outperform their larger brethren during periods of several years or more. The 
same goes for mutual funds that invest in these companies. 
</P>
<P>
This table illustrates the profit potential of leading small-company funds for 
people who can afford to keep their money invested for many years. Each of the 
portfolios listed has beaten the group's average gain for the past five, 10 and 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Notably, the period since 1984 has been substandard, at least compared to 
larger issues. For this reason, small stocks might be ready to lead the market 
in coming years, some observers believe.

MAYBE MOVIE STARS ARE JUST TOO GORGEOUS FOR OUR OWN GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within a span of several days, I saw the 1955 movie "Marty" on a PBS broadcast 
and "Pretty Women" in a theater. 
</P>
<P>
I left "Pretty Woman" with mixed emotions. I watched this stunning woman fall 
in love with a rich, gorgeous hunk. Even though she was a prostitute with no 
manners, class or education, she "cleaned up real good" and managed to capture 
millionaire Richard Gere by way of her long legs and practiced love-making. 
</P>
<P>
The more I thought about this movie, the more uncomfortable I became. It did 
have a romantic ending: He rode the limousine back to the slums to rescue her 
from her sleazy life of sin. But how did this movie relate to me? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know anyone as gorgeous as Roberts -- luscious lips, thick mane of 
hair, full bust line. And Gere? He's no slouch either -- firm body, wonderful 
tan and just a hint of gray hair. (Where did he get that tan if he was so busy 
raiding corporations?) 
</P>
<P>
But are these people real? I thought movies today were supposed to be more 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
And then I watched "Marty." Ernest Borgnine is not Gere and Betsy Blair is not 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
How can two "dogs" find love and happiness when they are so ugly and their 
lives are so boring? 
</P>
<P>
He was a butcher. When did you last meet a single woman who wanted to date a 
butcher? And she was a science teacher. Do you know how intimidated most men 
are by female science teachers? (I know, because I'm a female science teacher.) 
</P>
<P>
The men I meet today are looking for Julia Roberts. These same men complain the 
women they meet are seeking a multimillionaire who looks like Gere. 
</P>
<P>
There's a clue here, folks. We've been seeing the wrong movie. Next week, see 
"Marty."

MOSCOW FORMS A RUDIMENTARY EXCHANGE FOR COMMODITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Moscow has formed a rudimentary commodities exchange as the first 
step toward a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange was created in an attempt to improve the distribution of 
desperately needed goods, such as construction materials and high-technology 
equipment, the city's mayor said at a news conference Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It is a precursor to the dismantling of the centralized economic system, which 
officials say has taken the city to the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two enemies to creating a market economy," said Mayor Gavriil Popov, a 
respected reform economist. "One is the shadow economy and the other is the 
administrative system that rules our centralized economy. A commodities 
exchange will strike a blow to both." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange is the first fulfillment of reforms promised under the city's new 
leadership, elected in March. It is designed to serve as a go-between, bringing 
buyers and sellers together outside the constrictions of the centrally planned 
"command-administrative" system. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the poor distribution of goods and materials is among the most 
glaring weak points of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
Popov has vowed that the city will stand in the vanguard of democratic change 
-- even if it means colliding with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the central authorities would disapprove of the commodities exchange, 
Popov replied: "Well, let's put it this way: No one is asking their 
permission."

EXTERMINATION: CONSUMERS WANT LESS-TOXIC METHODS TO DESTROY INSECTS THAT CAUSE 
$300 MILLION IN DAMAGE EACH YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE BOYER, Boyer is a Riverside free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Donna Conder learned she had termites in her 28-year-old house in Orange, 
she was worried. Allergies and health problems made the 38-year-old nurse want 
to avoid traditional fumigation, where a tent is placed over the house and 
toxic gas pumped in. 
</P>
<P>
So she was happy to try a new method -- Isothermics' Thermal Pest Eradication 
-- that kills termites with hot air. 
</P>
<P>
The house is tented and hot air pumped in for several hours until it reaches a 
temperature lethal to termites, said Jedd Bennett, vice president of 
Isothermics Inc., the Anaheim company that licenses the method. 
</P>
<P>
Conder removed some items from the house before the October treatment, 
including fruit, plastics and an antique organ, but said nothing was damaged 
and she was pleased with the process, which cost $1,260. 
</P>
<P>
"I would highly recommend it," she said, even though it might cost 10% to 30% 
more than fumigation. "Can you put a price on your health?" 
</P>
<P>
Most people aren't as sensitive to chemicals as Conder. But an increasing 
public distrust of pesticide safety is pushing researchers to devise new 
methods to eliminate termites. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects alternative methods to totally replace traditional treatments. 
Instead, exterminators are likely to be using a variety of techniques in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The pest-control industry, prodded by consumer demand, is interested in new 
methods that are less toxic but still effective in the war against termites, 
which do more than $300 million in damage each year to California homes. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are also placing new restraints on pest-control methods as 
they learn more about long-term health effects. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a changing and often-confusing array of choices for consumers, 
who must weigh risks, effectiveness and cost in deciding how to eliminate their 
termites. 
</P>
<P>
It's a big problem because termites are a fact of life in Southern California. 
If you live here long enough, they'll find your house, said John Munro, 
director of education for the industry trade group Pest Control Operators of 
California Inc. in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, termites are increasing right along with the human population in 
Southern California. Scores of new subdivisions have transformed previously 
inhospitable areas into a smorgasbord for the insects, said Michael Rust, 
entomology professor at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Termites like water, warmth and wood, so housing tracts are perfect for 
satisfying their appetites. In fact, anything made of cellulose is tasty to 
them, including newspapers, books and cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
Orkin Pest Control recently ranked the Los Angeles area fifth on its list of 
top 20 termite locations, said Judith Donner at Orkin headquarters in Atlanta. 
Orkin estimates that termites ate enough wood in the L.A. region last year to 
build 11 new homes. That gets expensive. Californians spent $309 million in 
1986 on termite treatment and structural repair, according to a 1988 study by 
the pest-control trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties represented $129.4 million of that, 
Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County in 1986, the average termite-extermination treatment cost 
$640, the trade group reported. California has 1,510 pest control companies, 
the state says. 
</P>
<P>
Extermination methods depend on the type of termite. Southern California has 
two main types, drywood and subterranean. You can have both at the same time, 
requiring two types of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the termites can be difficult without close inspection, even for 
experts, and it can be especially hard if they are in parts of the house hidden 
from view. 
</P>
<P>
Subterranean termites build up mud tubes along the exterior of a house as they 
travel from the ground up to the wood. Drywood termites push out waste pellets 
near damaged areas. Both termites swarm to start new colonies and then leave 
discarded wings lying near their new home. 
</P>
<P>
To find hidden termites, professionals may use probing tools to examine damaged 
wood, listening devices to pick up termite sounds or fiber optics to see inside 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Beagles are also trained to sniff out termites. TADD Services Corp., which 
operates in the Bay Area, says its canine inspectors are more accurate than 
humans because they can wriggle into areas people can't reach and aren't fooled 
by signs of past infestation. 
</P>
<P>
The pooches make a pawing motion only if they smell live termites, said 
spokeswoman Dorothy Taylor. She said TADD dogs are "100% accurate -- they're 
the only animals with malpractice insurance." 
</P>
<P>
But University of Florida associate professor Nan-Yao Su, a termite expert, 
isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anything that's 100%," he said. "They're always hard to 
detect." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the termites you're more likely to find are drywoods, 
especially if you live near the coast, entomology professor Rust said. They 
live inside the wood of your house. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional treatment for drywood termites is fumigation with Vikane (sulfuryl 
fluoride) or methyl bromide. Both are poisonous gases that can penetrate into 
the wood of a house and kill virtually all termites -- and anything else -- 
present. Because they're odorless, tear gas (chloropicrin) is used with both 
fumigants to warn people of the danger. 
</P>
<P>
However, each year a few people in California die inside houses being 
fumigated. Generally, they are burglars, drunks, transients or suicides who 
forced their way into tented buildings despite warning notices, according to 
the state Structural Pest Control Board, which regulates pest-control 
operators. Since 1980, California has had 25 fumigation deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Fumigation and airing out the house afterward usually takes about 24 hours, 
during which time people, pets and plants have to stay out. Food and medicine 
must be removed, sealed in metal or glass containers or put in plastic bags -- 
including items in the refrigerator or freezer. 
</P>
<P>
Some government and industry officials are suggesting that consumers remove 
food and medicine or use metal or glass containers, because current plastic 
bags don't keep out all the fumigant. Manufacturers are now developing bags 
that offer better protection. But, scientists say, exposed food won't make you 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
Methyl bromide is the more commonly used structural fumigant in California, 
said Dennis Gibbons, senior industrial hygienist for the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. It was used about twice as often as Vikane in 1987, the 
most recent data available. 
</P>
<P>
Fumigations usually cost at least $1,000 to $1,200 and can go as high as 
$2,000, depending on the cubic footage of the house and the fumigant. Methyl 
bromide is cheaper than Vikane, Scheffrahn said, so it can be more profitable 
for an exterminator to use, with the risk of occasionally having to replace 
ruined carpet padding. 
</P>
<P>
Methyl bromide can react with certain items, including rubber padding, fur 
coats, leather and cinder block, and produce a permanent odor, Scheffrahn said. 
"It really stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Olson found that out the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
In July, she was planning to move into a just-purchased Anaheim house with her 
husband and two children. The home was fumigated as part of the sale. When the 
Olsons went to do some work before moving in, they immediately noticed a foul 
odor from the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
She tried scrubbing it. Vinegar, borax, baking soda -- nothing worked. Finally, 
an exterminator told her that the smell was from methyl bromide reacting with 
the rubber carpet pad and it wouldn't come out. The fumigation company sent 
someone the next day to replace the carpet pad, and the smell soon disappeared, 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Exterminators should test the carpet pad if they aren't sure what it's made of, 
said Herb Pencille, general manager of Hydrex Termite Control of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Even that isn't foolproof, though, and Pencille said plenty of exterminators 
have had to replace carpet padding, himself included. He now generally uses 
Vikane to avoid the problem, which costs consumers 10% to 15% more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But methyl bromide could work fine in an empty house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to remove items the methyl bromide might react with and to have 
good fan circulation in the house to avoid too much fumigant in any one area, 
said Bob McKeand, an executive with methyl bromide's maker, Great Lakes 
Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
If the home is aired out properly, it shouldn't smell, said Jerry Campbell, 
California Department of Food and Agriculture supervisor of registration. 
Exterminators must check the inside air with a measuring device to make sure 
it's safe to return. If people have any problems afterward, they should call 
their exterminator or the local agricultural commissioner, and see a doctor if 
they feel sick. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has about 55,000 fumigations a year and only receives about 
12 to 15 odor complaints annually, according to the Agricultural Commissioner's 
office, which investigates allegations of pesticide misuse and 
pesticide-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, it's pesticide misapplication or not following safety procedures 
that cause illness, or in rare cases, death, said Frank Davido, who 
investigates pesticide problems for the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
However, some people are more sensitive to chemicals and odors and may feel 
unwell even if the pesticide was applied properly, Davido said. But it's hard 
to determine whether symptoms are caused by fumigation, because they often 
mimic other illnesses, such as flu. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of pesticide poisoning include headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, 
coughing and tremors. People who have allergies should ask beforehand which 
fumigant is to be used and consult with their doctor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If done right, fumigation should not be hazardous and is a very effective way 
to kill termites and other bugs in the house, said Assistant Prof. Rudolf 
Scheffrahn, termite researcher at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the recommended time for airing out a house might need to be 
lengthened, and he advises residents to leave their windows open overnight when 
they return after a fumigation.

HOW TO TELL IF YOU HAVE TERMITES 
</P>
<P>
* Subterranean termites build mud tubes from the soil up the side of a house. 
To find out if they're from past or present termites, try knocking them down 
and see if they reappear. If they do, the termites are busy in your house. 
</P>
<P>
* Drywood termites kick out tiny waste pellets in the area they're working. 
Look for sawdust-like debris. 
</P>
<P>
* Both types of termites swarm to start new colonies. Subterraneans swarm in 
the winter and spring, usually after a rain. Drywoods swarm on warm fall days. 
Both discard their wings and leave them lying near their new home. 
</P>
<P>
* Wood damaged by termites will sound hollow when tapped, because much of the 
inside has been eaten away. Termites also make sounds by bumping their heads 
against tunnel walls when disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO CHOOSE AN EXTERMINATOR 
</P>
<P>
* Call the Structural Pest Control Board at (213) 620-2255 or (916) 920-6323. 
Staff members can tell you if a company you're considering has had any 
complaints in the last two years, and how they were resolved. Ask if the 
company has a current license. 
</P>
<P>
* Check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if anyone has complained 
about the company. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask friends and neighbors to recommend a pest control operator who gave them 
good service. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure the company has a permanent address and phone number so you can 
contact someone later if you notice any problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Understand how the recommended treatment works and what steps are necessary. 
For example, fumigation requires that plants and other items be removed from a 
home. The exterminator should be willing to answer your questions and provide 
information about the treatment. Companies are required to disclose the type of 
pesticide used. 
</P>
<P>
* Get two or three inspections and compare recommendations and prices. If the 
reports differ widely, ask inspectors why. If you're not satisfied with the 
explanation, contact the pest control board.

INCOHERENT MAN FORCES JET ON N.Y. ROUTE BACK TO LAX

A Pan American World Airways 747 jet bound for New York with 269 passengers 
abruptly turned around in mid-flight and returned to Los Angeles on Saturday 
after a passenger began threatening and ranting incoherently, witnesses and 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The disoriented man was arrested by police after the jumbo jet landed at Los 
Angeles International Airport shortly after noon. A police bomb squad removed 
the man's luggage but found no explosives, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed against the passenger, whose name was not released. Los 
Angeles police questioned him and determined that he had committed no crime. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance for psychiatric 
evaluation, said Sgt. John Hone of the Los Angeles police's airport station. 
</P>
<P>
The plane did not resume its flight to New York until 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The flight, Pan Am 90-A, took off for Kennedy Airport at 10:15 a.m. Slightly 
more than an hour later, the plane's captain radioed air traffic controllers in 
Los Angeles, asking for permission to return. 
</P>
<P>
"The captain elected to return because a passenger was interfering with the 
flight crew," said Federal Aviation Administration duty officer Jerry Acosta. 
</P>
<P>
Several passengers sitting in the rear described the man as thin and well 
dressed, with black hair slicked back. The witnesses said he behaved strangely 
and babbled incessantly through the flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to the guy, and he was acting extremely eccentric," said Bob 
Martino, 26, of the Bronx, who sat two seats away from him. "He was a real 
weirdo. I got really nervous and asked to see the captain." 
</P>
<P>
David Love, a Boston man sitting a row in front said he heard the man ask: 
"What do you do when your number's up?" 
</P>
<P>
A woman sitting between Martino and the man said she became so alarmed that she 
moved to another seat. She said the man frightened her by repeatedly -- without 
prompting -- assuring her that the flight would be a safe one. 
</P>
<P>
After the woman moved, Martino prepared to do the same. The man then became 
briefly and chillingly coherent, telling Martino: "Don't try to leave or I'll 
throw you out of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Several flight attendants repeatedly went back to talk to the man, witnesses 
said. One attendant brought a first-aid kit and an oxygen mask. "People were 
constantly in and out of there. I was petrified," Los Angeles physician Joe 
Gutman said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's captain also talked briefly to the man. Witnesses said that just 
before the plane landed, the unidentified captain told passengers that a faulty 
gauge was forcing the return to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A bomb squad member in a flame-retardant suit removed the man's luggage.

A Palmdale man was in custody Saturday after he allegedly ran a red light 
during a high-speed police chase and collided with a car filled with San 
Fernando Valley high school students on their way home from a pep rally. Two 
students died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
A third student in the car also suffered minor injuries in the accident that 
occurred at 9:10 p.m. Friday at Chatsworth Street and Laurel Canyon Boulevard 
in Mission Hills, police said. Arrested was Ray Vargas Servin, 21, whose pickup 
truck slammed into a car driven by Uriel Fernandez, 16, of Pacoima, who died. 
Fernandez, a junior at San Fernando High School, was taken to San Fernando 
Community Hospital, where he died from his injuries. Aracely Hernandez, 18, of 
San Fernando died at the scene. She was a senior and cheerleader at Sylmar High 
School. Juan Melendrez, 16, of Pacoima, was treated for cuts and bruises at 
Holy Cross Medical Center and released.

DIANNE KLEIN: FULLERTON WOMAN'S LIFE IS A LONG, LOVING LETTER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lovina Elizabeth Lund recalls those days in Kirkman, Miss., on what had been a 
sprawling plantation. 
</P>
<P>
They were making a fresh start -- she and her parents, two brothers, grandma 
and grandpa -- after selling the farm and heading down south. By then, Myrtie, 
her older sister, had died of a burst appendix. She was only 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
This was several years ago, mind you. . . . 1914, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
We are sitting in Lovina's living room in Fullerton and I can see the glint in 
her eyes. There were the palominos, Babe and Nancy, and the Rhode Island red 
rooster, Wilhelm. That bird would strut around muttering what sounded like Hock 
der Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
The cotton, of course, grew in vibrant, blossoming rows. The wild persimmon 
trees. So much watermelon that you'd just eat the heart and then feed the rest 
to the cows. 
</P>
<P>
And remember the black women powdering their faces with flour before a Saturday 
night in town? There was always that beautiful gospel singing coming from the 
Baptist church, all day Sunday morning and on through the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Then the memories abruptly depart and others come back in snatches to take 
their place: Alaska, Omaha, Grand Rapids, South Dakota, Los Angeles, the 
desert, the children and both husbands, jobs and friends. The bumpy trajectory 
leaves Lovina slightly embarrassed, and she clutches at her book. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I'm not as sharp as I used to be," she tells me, time and again. 
"Some days are better than the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lovina's stories always come out, a portrait of an extraordinary life 
begun July 31, 1893, in Gaines, Kent County, Mich., on the Brown family farm. 
</P>
<P>
That too is where Lovina begins her book, "All Things Work Together," a 
self-published autobiography off the presses barely more than a month. It took 
her four years to write it, in longhand, on a pad resting against her knees. 
Arthritis ruled out typing. 
</P>
<P>
This story of one woman's life is a long, loving letter home -- to Lovina's 
family, her friends and to anybody else. It ropes the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Fast with a smile, Lovina is dressed today in a lavender dress, jacket and 
pearls. Next month she'll be 97 years old. She lives alone. She made her weekly 
beauty shop appointment the day before I came; this time she got a perm. 
</P>
<P>
Lovina doesn't drive anymore -- she sold her '62 Chevy at the age of 94 -- 
because she didn't want to chance blemishing a perfect record on the road. She 
says she's not sure how much longer God wants her to hang around. Already she's 
outlived everybody else in her family, and she's got a bad heart. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this," she says, pulling out a Lifeline alarm that hangs from a chain 
tucked under her dress. "You push this and all hell breaks loose." 
</P>
<P>
Then Lovina lets go with one of those belly laughs. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons that Lovina decided to write her story down are many, of course, 
but mainly she says it's so her family can figure out just who's related to 
whom. These things tend to blur over the years; people move on and lose sight 
of their roots. 
</P>
<P>
"And a lot of these people that we consider family are no relation at all," she 
says, thumbing through the genealogical listings in the back of her book. "Like 
this Gordon. He lives in Castro Valley. He writes to me, considers me in his 
family. They all do." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, is just fine with Lovina. She loves people and these days 
wishes more of them would come around. She doesn't get out as often as she'd 
like. Old age makes you more dependent on people, and Lord knows, everybody has 
got to have their own life. 
</P>
<P>
"I really have no idea why I've lived so long," she says. "I really have no 
idea. . . . It's because I live such a clean life." 
</P>
<P>
Then comes another laugh. What else are you supposed to say with a question 
like that? 
</P>
<P>
Lovina takes a pause, and then she goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe God has let me live this long because I had things to do. . . . Now I 
pray, every day, that He'll let me get everything finished." 
</P>
<P>
Because, naturally, there is so much more to get done. The book, for starters. 
Copies are piled up here in her small house. She's got to get them on the move. 
She promised so many of them for Christmas presents, months before they were 
even out. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the day next month when her eighth great-great-grandchild is 
due. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see," she says, marching across the room to retrieve a tiny scrap of 
paper cluttered with the names of all the rest. Then she reads the list aloud. 
</P>
<P>
The total to date breaks down like this: three children, nine grandchildren, 20 
great-grandchildren and the seven little ones after that. 
</P>
<P>
Lovina and I keep talking, about this time and that, about who worries about 
whom. Life, of course, isn't the same as it has always been. The slowness of 
this new pace sometimes gets Lovina down. She so enjoys having things to do. 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, she painted another picture, something like No. 222, as a 
wedding gift for her nephew and his bride. It was a still-life, in oil, of 
roses in a vase. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lovina asks me, again, just how it was that I had heard about her and her 
book. I think it was by chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny," she says, "but it seems like I've known you all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Lovina, I tell her, I could say the same about you.

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most drivers, being wedged in a crush of cars, inhaling exhaust and inching 
a path through a parking lot is not the most enjoyable way to spend a Friday 
night. But by the looks of it, Marty Yazzie was having the time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Loud rap music blasted from a bank of speakers in the cab of Yazzie's souped-up 
1987 Toyota King Cab. Nodding his head to the beat, the 21-year-old Westminster 
machinist turned to his passenger, smiled, and said, "If I turned the amp up a 
little bit more, it would make our hair stand up." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, this is the place," Yazzie said. "Everybody knows that's the place to go 
-- Balboa -- to show off your car." 
</P>
<P>
This is cruising, Newport Beach style. 
</P>
<P>
Like the main streets of towns across the country, by 11 p.m. on Friday and 
Saturday nights, the west end of Balboa Boulevard echoes with the sounds of 
expensive car stereos, screams and laughter. The cacophony is testimony to 
hundreds of young adults from all over the county who make the weekend 
pilgrimage to queue up for hours on the peninsula's main drag. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say it can be a real mess. When the cruisers are out in force, a 
normally quick trip from Coast Highway down to Balboa Pier can seem like a 
millennium. Businesses say the excessive traffic drives away customers. And 
city and police officials, responding to complaints, say they are concerned 
about problems associated with large crowds and alcohol -- noise, litter and 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising is not new to Newport, and police say this summer will not be much 
different despite a host of laws against it. In 1984, the City Council banned 
the warm-weather ritual in an ordinance allowing police to cite anyone 
repeatedly driving along city streets. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance proved difficult to enforce and, in 1986, working with residents 
and businesses, police tried a new tactic and began a checkpoint program that 
prohibits anyone except residents and those with business or pleasure 
destinations from driving past 15th Street on the peninsula when traffic is 
heavy. 
</P>
<P>
But the procession of cruisers keeps coming. This summer, the newest hot spot 
for congregating teens is a large parking lot at the corner of 32nd Street and 
Newport Boulevard. Nearby residents have complained to police about the noise, 
trash and broken glass. The William J. Cagney Trust, which owns the property, 
also has hired a private security company to patrol the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they are cracking down, keeping an eye out for alcohol and vandalism 
and deploying a foot patrol to walk the area on Friday and Saturday nights. So 
far, their efforts have had limited success. 
</P>
<P>
Although police don't keep statistics on citations complaints in the area, 
crowds continue to get bigger, Sgt. Andy Gonis says. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a zoo going on out there," said Demetre Ermacoff, manager of Port's 
Pharmacy in Lucky's plaza on 32nd Street, who first noticed the problem one 
warm afternoon in February. As a result, he said, he is considering dropping 
his usually late seasonal hours because of inconvenience to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Sawards, who manages a dry cleaners in the plaza, said she has heard 
complaints from other area businesses that they lose patrons with the 
night-time crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the customers don't want to come down," Sawards said. "A lot of 
people don't want to come near this place because of the kids . . . (they 
would) just as soon go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
And Rod Volk, a resident who lives across the street, complains that those 
hanging out remain on the streets until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Littering is a big problem. They come and dump their beer cans in the patio 
area in front of my house . . . but it's not to the point that I'm pulling my 
hair out," said Volk, who has lived in the area for the past two years. "I 
think the biggest problem is the kids running up and down the street at 2, 
2:30, 3 o'clock in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Cruising was fashionable before the days of fast food and drive-ins. In Orange 
County over the past few years, several other cities have battled traffic 
problems created by cruising. In Anaheim, police use a strict curfew 
prohibiting teens from being out on the street past 10 p.m. In Santa Ana, where 
drivers disturb neighbors with loud music, littering and drug dealing, cruising 
was banned in an ordinance passed last November. 
</P>
<P>
But solutions such as the traffic checkpoint and letting property owners police 
their own lots have been more effective, said Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim 
Newman. The signs of success are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Checkpoint hours have been reduced from five to three since cruisers have 
gotten the word about the enforcement effort, Gonis said. Dayna Pettit, 
president of the Balboa Peninsula Point Assn., a group that represents 
residents who live near the tip of the peninsula, says the residents-only lane 
has been a great relief. 
</P>
<P>
But Gonis and others admit that while the checkpoint has relieved congestion, 
the result has been that the cruisers have migrated up the peninsula, off 
public streets and onto private property. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Lempka, 23, a Fountain Valley plumber who's been cruising Newport Beach 
for the last five years, says that since the 15th Street checks began, driving 
down the boulevard toward the Balboa Pier has lost its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason to go down there anymore," Lempka said. "Why sit in traffic 
for 45 minutes to an hour just to get turned around? If you want to do that, 
why don't you go down and sit on the (Riverside Freeway) at 3 o'clock on a 
Friday afternoon?" 
</P>
<P>
But, he adds, cruising Newport is still the thing to do on a weekend night. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, cruisers have searched for other places where they can see and be 
seen. Numerous parking lots in the city became hangouts. A plaza with a 
late-night Jack-in-the-Box restaurant at the corner of Coast Highway and Balboa 
Boulevard was a popular meeting place until it was also roped off by private 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
The Lucky Plaza, no stranger to cruisers in the past, seems to be again a hot 
spot, and roping-off methods are now being tried there by its owners. The large 
lot straddles Newport and Balboa boulevards and was being used by cruisers as a 
throughway between the two streets until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis says that, with luck, the current blockading methods in the Lucky lot may 
send the cruisers moving on again. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a situation in that parking lot is controlled . . . with cooperation of 
all involved parties . . . hopefully the cruisers that are coming down here 
will go elsewhere," Gonis said. But Carl Bauer of Dana Point and a cruising 
veteran figures the Lucky lot will remain home for the cruisers for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago we were down at Jack-in-the-Box. Three years ago we were here 
(by the Carl's Jr. at 32nd and Balboa). Four years ago we were down in Balboa. 
We'll just go someplace else," Bauer said. "If someone takes the initiative and 
moves someplace else, we'll follow. But I think this is it."

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old Huntington Beach boy who was allegedly abducted by his father at 
age 4 and taken out of state has been reunited with his mother for the first 
time since the incident, police reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The father, Wayne Collinsworth, 30, allegedly left California with his son in 
1982 amid divorce proceedings, according to a complaint the boy's mother filed 
with Huntington Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Larry Miller said the mother, a Huntington Beach woman whose name was not 
released, was reunited with her son Friday at Orangewood Children's Home, the 
county's center for abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
Miller did not know whether the boy was at the shelter, saying that he only 
knew the child was "placed there" on Friday to "facilitate the reunification 
with the natural mother." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Collinsworth has remarried, and the boy had been told that his 
father's second wife was his real mother. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy did not know of his real mother and had to be told by Huntington Beach 
police that she existed," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother notified police of the pending case when she suspected that her 
ex-husband and the boy had returned to Huntington Beach to live with 
Collinsworth's parents. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Collinsworth nor the boy's mother could be reached for comment.

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Francisco and Maria Grueso had looked forward to the day when their oldest son 
would graduate from high school. It would be a day when they would beam with 
pride, knowing in their hearts that all the work and the gamble of leaving 
their native Spain to move to Orange County had paid off in a way that only a 
parent can truly appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no commencement ceremonies for young Francisco. He dropped out 
of Garden Grove High School in the middle of his senior year. To the shock of 
his parents, his younger brothers, Andres, 17, and David, 16, soon followed 
suit. Then, 14-year-old Javier also began losing interest in his studies and 
teetered toward the edge of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
For the Gruesos, those were dark days, said Maria, 42. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so upset because a person without a career is nobody. It's better to 
go on studying for a better future," she said last week from the family's 
Garden Grove home. 
</P>
<P>
But now, thanks to a Garden Grove Unified School District program that seeks to 
prevent students from dropping out and tries to bring them back to school once 
they do, three of the Grueso sons have made a renewed commitment to their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco, 19, eventually enrolled in an adult learning center and earned a 
high school equivalency diploma. David is in continuation school and Javier, 
the youngest, decided not to drop out after learning from the experiences of 
his older brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say what happened to the Grueso family is far too common in Orange 
County. From Santa Ana to San Clemente, school districts are struggling to keep 
students in school and if they do drop out, trying to persuade them to return 
to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate for the 28 school districts in the county is 14.7%, lower than 
the statewide rate of 20.4%, according to a report recently released by the 
state Department of Education. All but Garden Grove, Irvine and the Laguna 
Beach unified school districts showed a decline in the dropout rate, which has 
decreased countywide by 25% over the past three years. Officials say the 
dropout rate is decreasing in part because of the innovative new programs being 
implemented by school districts across the county. 
</P>
<P>
Many districts, like Garden Grove Unified, have taken the offensive with 
aggressive programs to keep children in school. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are optimistic about a number of new prevention measures, 
such as the community outreach program that brought the Grueso brothers back to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Under such programs, outreach consultants track down students after they have 
been out of school for more than six weeks and try to talk them into returning. 
Other districts bring role models into the classrooms and hire social workers 
to work with students who have dropped out. Still others have programs that 
attempt to reach elementary school students and give them direction before they 
even have any thoughts of leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
For the Gruesos, these programs made all the difference. After Francisco quit 
school and began working in construction, he realized he didn't want to find 
himself "29 or 30 years old with no future and a pain in my back." Francisco 
said he simply lost interest in school once he bought a car his junior year and 
decided he would rather do other things. 
</P>
<P>
But his parents, who had left the Spanish capital of Madrid specifically to 
give their children the benefits of a U.S. education, pushed him to finish his 
schooling and asked the school for help. The family was aided by Rose Garcia, a 
community outreach counselor, who presented Francisco with alternative ways of 
completing his education. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco is now studying electrical engineering at the ITT Technical Institute 
in Buena Park. Now older and wiser, he said he has seen the error of his ways 
and he hopes he is now a better role model for his brothers than before. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did wasn't right," he said. "I thought if my brothers saw my example 
(of returning to school), things would change." 
</P>
<P>
Within the last few months, the Anaheim and Garden Grove school districts have 
hired a number of outreach specialists who, among other things, work with 
students who run a high risk of becoming involved with gangs or drugs. Other 
specialists concentrate on tracking down students with attendance problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking prevention measures at the elementary level and intervention 
measures at the intermediate level," said Alan Trudell, a Garden Grove Unified 
School District spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Tran was another student who, like the Grueso sons, followed a family 
pattern of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
To the 16-year-old Westminster High School dropout, leaving school seemed like 
the natural thing to do. None of her older siblings had ever graduated from 
high school. But after a couple of months of spending days watching television 
and visiting friends, Tran got a call from a dropout recovery specialist, who 
convinced her to enroll in an adult school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be staying (in adult school) for a while because the time 
schedule is good and it's easier," Tran said. "I didn't like the long hours and 
going from class to class. I just got sick of going to school." 
</P>
<P>
Tran was contacted by Cham Nguyen, a dropout recovery liaison from the 
Huntington Beach Union High School District who calls, writes or visits 
students who have been absent from school for long periods of time. She works 
individually with students, trying to get them enrolled in an alternative 
education program and helps them find jobs if they need one. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout recovery program is coordinated by Catherine McGough, who trains 
and coordinates six people to track students who have been absent for extended 
periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
McGough believes such programs are valuable, but hopes someday there won't be a 
need for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need to put people like me out of business. We need to pump more 
money into prevention. We need one-to-one counselors, tutoring, mentoring, 
outreach and parent education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster High School, which has the highest dropout rate in the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District, has its own prevention program for potential 
dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
The school selects 50 incoming freshmen who have been identified by their 
eighth-grade teachers as potential dropouts because of low reading skills, poor 
attendance and a pattern of underachievement. The students are placed in 
smaller classes where they receive more personalized attention. The program 
also gets parents involved by having them monitor homework for at least one 
hour on school nights and by having them in constant contact with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Union High School District, which offers similar programs, has also 
hired its first full-time social worker and plans to hire two more to help 
students with problems at home get assistance from social services agencies 
outside of school. Three interns also assist the social worker and provide more 
one-to-one contact with the family, counselor and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County schools have made progress keeping kids in school, many 
believe there is still a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything that we can to keep students in school," said Bobbi 
Zane, Anaheim Union's spokeswoman. "There is only so much that we can do. It's 
up to the family to take advantage of a free public education. It's just not a 
high school problem, it's a social problem." 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Ana Unified School District, officials are not only buoyed by a 
decrease in dropouts from 41.8% in 1986 to 22.8% in 1989, but also by a record 
enrollment of 3,815 ninth-grade students in 1990, about 600 more than the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Rudy Castruita believes one of the programs most responsible for 
the decrease in dropouts and the increase in ninth-graders is Stay in School, 
which was initiated by Superior Court Judge Jack Mandel to show students that 
good things happen when they refuse to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Mandel's program brings professionals from all walks of life into 8th- and 
10th-grade classrooms at least six times a semester, where they discuss the 
benefits of completing their education. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of ways to overcome what these students may perceive as 
barriers to higher education or certain jobs," said Greg Rankin, principal at 
Lathrop Intermediate School in Santa Ana. "This is one of many ways to raise 
students' expectations of themselves. The students need to see that their 
potential can be unlimited." 
</P>
<P>
Following a similar theme as the Stay in School program, the district is also 
making an effort to reach students at an even younger age by hosting career 
days at all its elementary schools.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: FENCED-OUT FANS MIGHT LOSE TOUCH WITH HEROES

<TEXT>
<P>
California Angels management recently decided to erect a six-foot-high 
chain-link fence to keep fans away from players who, after games, have to make 
their way from the stadium to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The new fence runs from the stadium near Gate 7 to another fenced-off area 
where players park their automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Until the barrier was built three weeks ago, Anaheim was one of the last 
stadiums in the major leagues where fans -- if they wanted to wait outside 
after a game -- could walk up to a player and ask for an autograph or just ask 
a question. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Angels officials, the unrestrained fans mobbed and stampeded 
team members. It got out of hand, and the players complained. Up went the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was so intent on getting Wally Joyner's autograph that she rammed his 
automobile, said Kevin Uhlich, the Angels stadium operations director. 
</P>
<P>
"It became too much of a problem. The players were being bombarded, crowded and 
stampeded by the fans," Uhlich said. "Something had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Fans called The Times to complain that it was just another move by management 
to keep them away from the players. An editor sent me to Anaheim Stadium last 
Sunday to see how the fence was working. 
</P>
<P>
Watching youngsters hang on the barrier and call out to players dredged up some 
childhood memories of a baseball that sat on my dresser at home. On the 
horsehide was the signature of Yogi Berra, one of my childhood heroes. The 
baseball was not important; the signature was. Because of Yogi, I spent four 
summers crouched behind home plate ducking bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
That ball came into my life so long ago that the line between fact and fantasy 
might have become blurred. I think it was the 1949 World Series between the 
Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees at Ebbets Field. I vaguely remember 
hanging over the railing with my dad during pregame batting practice calling 
out Yogi's name. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Yogi stopped what he was doing and came over to the railing. He took 
the pen and signed the ball. Or maybe, as my sister once suggested, dad bought 
the ball from a stadium vendor with Yogi's signature already on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Yogi baseball shared the sacred altar atop my dresser with mementos from 
some of my all-time favorite players -- Harold (Pee Wee) Reese, John (The Big 
Cat) Mize, Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember listening to baseball games on the radio in my bedroom and 
studying the mementos on top of the dresser. They were an important part of my 
life then. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a shame if the new fence in any way impedes a youngster from 
getting the autograph of his or her baseball hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Winfield, Mr. Winfield," the youngsters called through the fence as the 
superstar walked by on the other side of the fence. "Please sign this. Please." 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia stopped by the fence. A crowd gathered. He signed autograph after 
autograph as the gloves, baseball cards and programs were passed over the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
I can't remember when I last saw my Yogi baseball, but I fear it has been lost 
forever during one of the many moves. But its memories are still there.

Charles Kaltenthaler claims to be a tree expert. Squatting on the dry grasses 
of Upper Newport Bay in Saturday sunshine, the 6-year-old picked at the roots 
of the young cottonwood tree that he was helping to plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planting trees 'cause it gives us oxygen, and we breathe out carbon 
dioxide, and 'cause they make a nice place for birds to live," Charles said. "I 
climb trees all the time, but I'm not going to climb this one till it's good 
and healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Charles, two friends and the friends' father were among the 100 people who 
turned out Saturday for the California Wildlife Fund's tree planting. Sponsored 
by a local restaurant, the event drew environmentalists young and old who came 
to restore native flora to the Newport Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see all the (Argentine) pampas grass that's grown up around here, and 
over there, the Brazilian pepper trees," said Jim Cokas, a member of the 
volunteer naturalist program. 
</P>
<P>
Those South American plants are not indigenous to the area, he added, and 
therefore are not used for food or nesting by native animals and insects. 
</P>
<P>
Besides producing oxygen, Cokas said, "all they do is take up space." 
</P>
<P>
So, recruiting help from the community and from county environmental groups, 
Wildlife Fund officials organized the event not only to plant more than 450 
sycamore, cottonwood, oak, willow and elderberry seedlings, but also so 
volunteers could help root out some unwanted plants, such as pepper trees and 
pampas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to my friends about the bay, and they say, 'Leave it alone, why do 
you want to landscape it?' " Cokas said. "But, you know, humans have already 
inserted themselves into nature to such a degree that we can't back out now." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the marsh of Upper Newport Bay is covered by the hearty pampas grass, 
which Wildlife Fund spokesman John Scholl said was introduced here during the 
1950s, when county developers planted it at many projects. As the grasses grew 
and produced seeds, the plants gradually took root in Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Scholl said that by replacing the foreign plants with ones that naturally grow 
in the area, the ecological balance of the area can be slowly restored. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Avila, whose restaurant provided food for the volunteers, said he has 
been involved with projects to restore Newport Bay for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think of this place as a jewel, surrounded by concrete and 
developments," Avila said, adding that he thinks that residents will respond as 
their awareness increases. 
</P>
<P>
And Frieda Kinoshita, an Orange resident who belongs to the California Native 
Plant Society, said she is especially heartened to see the children out helping 
with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"At 45, I've seen wild areas that my children will never get a chance to see," 
Kinoshita said. "I often wonder what are they going to say about us two 
generations from now." 
</P>
<P>
For every tree planted, Avila's restaurant donated $5 to the Wildlife Fund. The 
money will go toward buying open space in California for preservation, Scholl 
said.

TAXING THE CABLE TV COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable television companies should be taxed on the same basis as other 
franchised operations such as the phone company, the power company and the gas 
company. These organizations pay franchise fees to do business in their 
respective areas. 
</P>
<P>
The phone, electric and cable TV all use similar equipment and, in many cases, 
occupy joint facilities both overhead on poles and underground. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes should be based on physical plants and not "good will" or any other 
indeterminate factor. 
</P>
<P>
If our tax assessor proceeds with his apparent plans for "phantom taxes," he'd 
better be ready to use the same assessment on other franchised operations! 
</P>
<P>
Actually this whole thing reeks of another attempted end run around Proposition 
13! 
</P>
<P>
Whatever taxes may be assessed will be passed right on through to the 
consumers, so who's kidding whom?

THE FERGUSON-BADHAM RACE FOR THE ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is very interesting to read that the Orange County Republican Party 
questions candidate Phyllis Badham's not signing the Pledge when Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson has attacked Badham several times -- one time calling her an 
airhead and, quoting from the Feb. 8 Times, saying: "Some of these daughters 
don't have enough to do so daddy helps them get into politics." 
</P>
<P>
It so happens that Badham has a very responsible job and has and is doing very 
well on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson so far has refused to attend any meeting Badham will attend. I believe 
it is the right of all voters to be able to be exposed to all candidates to ask 
questions, to get straight answers and to learn both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Badham is giving us a choice and is willing to be questioned at all meetings. 
Do you believe Ferguson should hide from exposure with Badham? 
</P>
<P>
I thank Badham for giving us a choice not controlled by a small group that does 
not want more than one candidate or one view.

EMERGENCY: POLICE CHIEF NEEDS BACKUP; 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH COUNCIL MUST FIND MONEY FOR HIS PLAN TO SAVE OAK VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach has shown it has a knack for turning around a neighborhood. It 
did just that with Commodore Circle, which a few years ago was on a downward 
spiral caused by drug dealers, absentee landlords and general neglect. The city 
cracked down on slum landlords, supervised massive repairs and increased police 
patrols. Today, Commodore Circle has a new name -- Amberleaf Circle -- to 
reflect its fresh new look and renewed neighborhood pride. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is much greater with Oak View, a larger residential neighborhood 
where the crime and social problems are much more complex and overwhelming. 
There are gang problems, ethnic tensions and overcrowding. Drug dealers ply 
their trade in the open. And in recent years there have been drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg is undaunted. He has proposed a 
$500,000 plan to recapture Oak View that is good enough to merit the City 
Council's backing. The plan would establish the city's first police substation 
in Oak View and staff it with four new officers. There also would be increased 
foot patrols, which have been used effectively in other neighborhoods where 
gang and drug activities are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
But Lowenberg's recommendations do not stop with law enforcement. Wisely, he 
has recognized that there are underlying social problems that need to be 
addressed, including working with youths before they enter gangs. His plan 
would provide for professionals to counsel youths and their families. 
</P>
<P>
There also would be added staffing and equipment for Oak View Community Center. 
In addition, Lowenberg recommended that the city establish a day laborer center 
so that unemployed men have a place to gather while waiting for work, rather 
than hanging out in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for all this is steep, and Huntington Beach is in no better shape 
than most cities in this post-Proposition 13 era. The City Council, whose 
initial reaction to Lowenberg's plan was favorable, would have to find the 
money in next year's budget by cutting other programs or raising fees. There is 
also no guarantee that Oak View can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
Even with these odds, one thing is certain: If nothing more is done, Oak View 
will get worse and its problems will spread to neighboring areas. A 
comprehensive attack this year at least gives the city a fighting chance to do 
for Oak View what it did for Commodore Circle. Its track record there offers 
encouragement. The City Council should approve the money that Lowenberg has 
requested.

TAXING THE CABLE TV COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No solvent company ever pays any taxes. 
</P>
<P>
If a cable TV company's assessment is raised, the cable company will collect 
the increased taxes (from subscribers) and pass the money on to the government. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of litigation to the government will be paid by taxpayers. The cost of 
litigation to the cable company will be paid by its subscribers, who are also 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Most people have to budget their luxuries and money. If the cable companies pay 
more taxes, their services will drop in the priority list of subscribers, and 
cable companies will have fewer customers, which is why they fight so hard to 
stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
In justice, all businesses should be assessed on the same basis. The assured 
loser in any struggle can only be the Orange County taxpayers.

EDUCATION BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial, "How to Improve Education" (May 25) is seriously flawed in 
several areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it's time for a change in the top management of the Orange County 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
But who for the past eight years has helped rubber-stamp the bad management, 
deficit spending and duplication of services The Times alludes to in its 
editorial? The answer is that all of these practices have been supported by 
current board President Elizabeth Parker, and the majority of her colleagues 
supported Supt. Robert Peterson's wasteful practices, but she is on the record 
as lying to the press about statements she made at a county board meeting in 
January of this year. The matter is well-documented. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is well aware of citizen concerns regarding decision-making on the 
county Board of Education, so I ask just what is the value of retaining board 
members who have done nothing to effect changes with regard to the decisions 
made by its top managers? 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury has been warning for years about problems at the Department of 
Education, but it has been Peterson and his board majority who have resisted 
change, and Parker is part of that majority. We need to look at an alternative 
to both Peterson and Parker when we vote Tuesday.

JAIL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 22-year resident of Yorba Linda, I was encouraged by the findings of the 
recent survey done by The Times in regards to Measure A, the Centralized Jail 
Initiative ("Voters Oppose Measure to Restrict Jail to Santa Ana," May 29). 
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that the majority of voters surveyed are against the 
initiative that would restrict the building of all future jails to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
I was horrified when I first learned that Yorba Linda supported this 
initiative. The jail we didn't want, which would supposedly lower the value of 
our homes, endanger our children and create traffic problems, is now acceptable 
to dump on our neighbors in another city just because it gets it out of our 
back yard and into theirs? 
</P>
<P>
I am glad that the rest of the county is evidently not willing to do to Santa 
Ana what some residents of Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills are all too willing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
I ask that all residents of Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills examine their 
thinking and vote no on Measure A.

JAIL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Measure A, the so-called Centralized Jail Initiative, would mandate that all 
new jails be built in the county seat, Santa Ana. It is questionable that this 
measure, if passed, would withstand a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless it poses a serious threat to efforts that have already been made 
to plan a remote jail site. 
</P>
<P>
We're all concerned about crime, and we all want to ensure that criminals are 
expeditiously tried, convicted and incarcerated. Measure A proponents would 
like all this to take place in Santa Ana. Let's be reasonable; Santa Ana simply 
isn't the place for all jails. The city is densely populated and has the most 
rapidly growing school population in the county. Both are adequate reasons to 
disqualify Santa Ana as a potential site. 
</P>
<P>
Please vote no on Measure A and make it clear to the County Board of 
Supervisors and Measure A proponents that a remote jail site is the appropriate 
solution to a pressing need.

A CANDIDATE'S CHARACTER PLAYS A ROLE IN IRVINE MAYOR CAMPAIGN

<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Dumont (Letters, May 27) states that credentials are not as important as 
moral character. 
</P>
<P>
Who would disagree with that? However, she goes on to state that moral 
character is the reason she is voting for Sally Ann Sheridan. Didn't Sheridan 
testify under oath that she had a master's degree from Harvard, which she, in 
fact, does not? 
</P>
<P>
Are we becoming so cavalier toward untrue statements that we accept these 
actions as not showing a lack of moral character? 
</P>
<P>
What a sad statement on society's moral character.

AIRPORT PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your continuing coverage of the construction at Orange County Airport has 
detailed the difficulties travelers face as a consequence of the inadequate 
"short-term" parking within walking distance of the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
You accurately reported that the current arrangement is intolerable. It 
contributes to missed flights, indigestion, high blood pressure and 
vituperative exchanges between the traveling public and airport employees. It 
also unnecessarily aggravates the traffic problem faced by those seeking only 
to pick up, or discharge, passengers and those whose business does not require 
parking services. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is reminiscent of the circumstances that existed in the mid-'80s. 
The only short-term parking was in the lot across from the terminal, and the 
so-called long-term parking was reached through a gate on the access road. The 
problem was that one had to decide whether to use the long-term lot before 
knowing whether any short-term parking was available. Naturally, peak traveling 
periods were often characterized by drivers passing up the long-term parking, 
driving to the terminal, discovering that the short-term lot was full, and 
circling the airport to get back to the long-term lot. 
</P>
<P>
One day while biding my time waiting for the next plane to San Francisco (I had 
missed my intended flight for reasons I'm sure you've surmised), it occurred to 
me that there was a simple solution to my recurrent traveler's dilemma. If I 
had only known that short-term parking was already full when I sailed by the 
long-term lot, I could have parked and arrived at the gate on time. Moreover, I 
wouldn't have contributed to the traffic jam in front of the terminal as I 
frantically tried to make my way back to long-term parking. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote to the airport manager suggesting that he place a sign beside the road 
visible to drivers before they got to the long-term lot informing them when 
short-term parking was full. The sign would allow those of us hurrying to catch 
planes to use the available parking immediately rather than having to circle 
the airport. Unfortunately, it took considerable effort and, finally, the 
assistance of the Board of Supervisors to get the job done. But once in place, 
the sign improved the situation.

NEWPORT SCHOOLS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing as a parent concerned for the educational future of my children 
and disillusioned with the lack of democratic process taking place at the 
Newport-Mesa Unified District. 
</P>
<P>
On April 17, the Newport-Mesa school board voted 4 to 3 to split the elementary 
schools to a K-3/4-6 grade configuration, against strong parental and community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Of over 200 parents who attended this meeting, not one spoke in favor of this 
split. 
</P>
<P>
We, as parents and homeowners, entrusted the board to represent us. Webster's 
defines "democracy" as "government by the people; a form of government in which 
the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them or by their 
elected officials under a free electoral system." Democracy, the accepted 
practice of the American people, is not taking place at the Newport-Mesa school 
district.

NET BAN WOULD HURT FISHERMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am responding to the letters recently published regarding the use of gill 
nets. I am not involved in the fishing industry; I work in a service-oriented, 
non-environmentally threatening industry. However, I will definitely vote no on 
the initiative to ban gill-net fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what Irving Friedman states in his letter (May 20), gill-net 
fishing has been around since the beginning of time. I'm not against progress. 
I think automation and an advanced society is inevitable and healthy to a 
degree. However, I also believe the line must be drawn somewhere, as was done 
in the fishing industry by issuing limited permits and placing net size 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In Assemblywoman Doris Allen's response (May 20) to Steven Burklund, she said 
she wanted to set the record straight, but she didn't. In fact, she said very 
little about the issues Burklund raised. Her letter was as full of holes as a 
gill net, just another politician saying nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The report she refers to is 5 years old. She fails to mention that there are 
ongoing studies and updated reports conducted after the implementation of 
regulations for gill-net use. She also states that fishermen will be 
compensated to convert to less-destructive equipment. Yes, they will, but the 
compensation is based on a narrow time frame that is unrealistic and unfair. 
Like any other industry, fishing has had its good and bad years, and fishermen 
are not, in fact, compensated based on the cost of the so-called replacement 
equipment but rather on their income tax return in a time frame the government 
designates. 
</P>
<P>
What does their income tax return have to do with the cost of that equipment? 
The fish and marine mammals will have a better chance of survival in 
gill-net-fished waters than these men will if this passes and gill nets are 
banned. They will lose not only their livelihood but their heritage as well. I 
personally feel that human lives are, by far, more important. 
</P>
<P>
If Assemblywoman Allen really wants to do something about the depleting 
population of the ocean, she would concentrate on exposing those industries 
that are blatantly dumping hazardous wastes into coastal waters and wherever 
else they arbitrarily choose. Has everyone forgotten about the recent oil spill 
off the Huntington Beach coast? What about all the children dying from cancer 
because they have been unknowingly exposed to toxic chemicals dumped illegally 
near their homes? How many raw sewage "spills" along the Southern California 
coast were there just last year? How long will we tolerate these atrocities 
before someone does as much about it as they are about gill nets? 
</P>
<P>
It's very easy to feel for a sweet-faced sea lion versus a gray-haired, 
scraggly looking old fisherman! The overpaid politicians rallying to ban 
gill-net fishing should stop preying on our sympathy to get reelected and get 
involved with and contribute to the real issues that are threatening to destroy 
our natural resources. The ocean population will naturally repopulate itself if 
a healthy environment to do so exists. Nothing can survive in a chemical-, oil- 
and sewage-polluted earth and ocean.

HUNTINGTON BEACH COUNCIL MAY USE BED TAX TO OFFSET BOND COSTS

<P>
The City Council will consider a plan Monday that may help defray the cost of a 
$20-million bond for which the city is obligated to help pay for a sprawling 
seaside redevelopment resort project. 
</P>
<P>
City planners have proposed that the city hire a consultant to study how much 
bed-tax revenue can be raised at four hotels planned at the ongoing Waterfront 
project to help repay such a bond. 
</P>
<P>
A 10% tax is charged on all hotel and motel rooms in the city, of which 6% goes 
into the Redevelopment Agency fund. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Waterfront proposal, the redevelopment portion of the tax would go 
toward repaying the bond. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed method of payment "is rather unusual," Deputy City Administrator 
Robert Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials favor it as a way of trimming the amount of money the agency 
will have to pay from tax-increment revenues to repay the bond. 
</P>
<P>
The bed-tax study, which would take a month or two to complete, would determine 
how much the agency could save on the bond, Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will also consider a plan to enable the Waterfront owners to 
lease Zack's concession stand, located on the beach across from the 
development, for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-acre hotel project at Pacific Coast Highway and Beach Boulevard, which 
also will include 800 condominiums, restaurants and shops, calls for a walkway 
to connect the facilites with the beach, so owners want to tie the snack shop 
into the development.

LINDSEY'S HIT GIVES MARINA ITS FINAL UPSET

<P>
Robin Lindsey held the Southern Section 5-A championship plaque proudly and 
deservedly Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The senior catcher's two-run single in the top of the seventh inning gave 
Marina High School a 6-4 victory over Diamond Bar in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Southern Section baseball title for Marina (17-12-1), which 
entered the playoffs as the third-place team from the Sunset League. Diamond 
Bar ends its season, 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the title game, Marina upset four teams, the latest a 4-1 defeat of 
Westlake, the No. 1-ranked team by USA Today, Tuesday in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey's single came with runners on second and third, two outs and a full 
count. With the count 2-2, the pitch he took appeared to be strike three to 
most of the Diamond Bar players who started off the field, but it was called a 
ball instead. 
</P>
<P>
Once the team returned, Lindsey singled to right-center field for the winning 
hit. Once he rounded first by three steps, he fell to the ground, pounding it 
in joy as he crawled back to the base. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fastball," Lindsey said. "I knew it would score two runs when I hit 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Hagerty (6-3) took the loss in relief and Sean Connors (3-3) got the 
victory, also in relief. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's rally was started by a leadoff walk by Brad Barton in the seventh. 
Chad Terry grounded into a force play, and Jeremy Preall grounded a ball toward 
the shortstop position on a hit-and-run. Tito Quiles was moving to cover 
second, and just missed getting back to the ball. The hit left runners on first 
and third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Hagerty raised the hopes of the Diamond Bar fans with a strikeout of Travis 
Boyd for the second out, but Lindsey, the senior catcher and Marina's emotional 
leader, came through. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be in that situation," Lindsey said. "I've been here three years 
and wanted it so much." 
</P>
<P>
After the hit, the job of protecting the lead fell to sophomore left-hander 
Connors, who pitched 3 1/3 innings of shutout relief. 
</P>
<P>
He walked Jeff Turley to start the inning but pinch-hitter Damian Hyams lined 
into a double play. Issac Garcia singled but Kevin Ware struck out to end the 
game and several Marina fans swept onto the field to join the team in 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe this?" Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said. "This is a great 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar errors allowed Marina to score three runs in the third and take a 
4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Newfield hit a two-out grounder that went through the legs of third 
baseman Jim Doyle, allowing a run to tie it, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
David Schultz then came up with runners on first and second and hit a 
two-hopper to shortstop Quiles. Quiles fumbled the ball then threw wildly to 
first, allowing Lindsey to score. Newfield, who started on first went to third, 
while Diamond Bar first baseman Tommy Thompson ran down the errant throw. 
Newfield took too big a turn at third, but when Thompson threw behind him, 
Newfield beat the relay home. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar (21-9) came back to it, 4-4, in the bottom of the third. Doyle 
reached second on a throwing error by third baseman Terry. Turley followed with 
a two-run home run to the right of the 362-foot sign in left field off starter 
Sean Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield's speed helped Marina get a run in the first. He had an infield single 
with two outs. He stole second and went to third on a wild throw by catcher 
Karl Thompson. Newfield continued home when Turley over-ran the ball in center 
field.

SOPHOMORE KEEPS HIS COOL IN PROVIDING MARINA'S RELIEF

Robin Lindsey usually speaks his mind to his teammates, but the Marina High 
School catcher had to bite his tongue in the fourth inning Saturday night at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey had to show some self-control when dealing with sophomore Sean Connors, 
who pitched 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief in the Vikings' 6-4 victory over 
Diamond Bar in the Southern Section 5-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared about what I could say to Connors," Lindsey said. "He's a young 
kid and he takes things hard. I'm a pretty verbal guy and sometimes that's bad 
for someone." 
</P>
<P>
Not for Connors, who relieved starter Sean Patterson with two out in the fourth 
inning. Connors allowed only one runner past second base, had two strikeouts 
and a couple walks to improve to 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really anxious to get out there and pitch," Connors said. "After the 
game I couldn't believe it. We won the 5-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Robin helped me a lot. He kept telling me I could get my fastball over the 
plate and I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said he never second-guessed his decision to use 
Connors, though the sophomore hadn't pitched since the Vikings' 4-2 victory 
over Hacienda Heights Wilson in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure (Diamond Bar) prepared for Patterson all the way," Renfrow said. 
"We're fortunate we had a kid the caliber of Connors to put in there." 
</P>
<P>
Connors made the most of his few opportunities to pitch this season. He spent 
most of the year in the bullpen, reliving seniors Dave Schultz and Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
"Connors is a team kid and he knows we win with seniors and we don't cheat them 
out of a chance to play," Renfrow said. "That's why we went with Patterson 
today. I could have (started) Connors." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the lanky left-hander started the day in the dugout. He said he wasn't 
surprised when Renfrow called on him. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot of confidence in me," Connors said. "We were in real trouble and 
I was ready." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar had runners on first and second with two out when Connors entered 
the game. He got slugger Jeff Turley, who hit a two-run home run the previous 
inning, to fly to center field to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing my fastball all the way," Connors said. "My curve wasn't 
working at all." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey said Connors ignored the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid has a heart the size of Texas," said Lindsey, whose two-run single in 
the seventh gave the Vikings the victory. "He went out there and did what he 
had to. I kept those guys off balance with his fastball."

Depending on which coach you talked to, either an umpire's poor judgment on the 
basepaths or Jaime Smith's speed on the basepaths gave El Toro High School the 
Southern Section 3-A softball title Saturday night -- an eight-inning, 1-0 
decision over Don Lugo. 
</P>
<P>
Smith beat out a two-out bouncer to shortstop Michelle Macias, enabling Corrie 
Yauney to score from third base with the game's only run. 
</P>
<P>
Don Lugo Coach Ray Sheffield argued with the first base umpire twice in the 
bottom of the eighth inning, after Kymm Maniscalco and Karie Yoshioka were both 
ruled safe on close plays. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco, after getting the first of three infield singles in the eighth, was 
forced at second on Yauney's grounder to short. Yoshioka then beat out a 
grounder to shortstop with Yauney going all the way to third while first 
baseman Kelli Opatkiewicz was looking at the umpire in shock. Smith's decisive 
hit followed. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield said after the game that Maniscalco was out by a full step and that 
several bad calls by the umpires in the last inning won the game for El Toro 
(29-1). 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt in anybody's mind that she (Maniscalco) was out at first 
and that's no way to win a CIF," Sheffield said. "When it comes to a game like 
this, the umpires are supposed to be top notch . . .whatever happens the girls 
should win it or lose it, not the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
"We got some bad calls during the game just like they did," El Toro Coach Jim 
Dougherty said. "But nobody's faster on the field than Jaime Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Paige Lauby (16-2) struck out 12 and shut down the Conquistadors (28-2) with 
runners in scoring position in each of the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"They were good with the inside pitch (they were hitting it) and that's my 
best," Lauby said. "So I tried to keep it outside. That's where I got a lot of 
my strikeouts." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams created and lost opportunities in unusual ways throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the second inning, a fly ball to left by Don Lugo's Erin Walsh 
dropped in for a double when Yoshioka lost it in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom half of the inning, a line drive by Lauby to the sun field -- 
left -- was ruled a double when it was dropped by Jennifer McNatt. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the third inning, Don Lugo, with Kristin Matulik on second base, 
Michelle Macias on first and Opatkiewicz at bat, attempted a double steal. El 
Toro catcher Maegan Juggert, attempting to catch Matulik at third, hit the 
batter Opatkiewicz in the head with the throw. Matulik upon reaching third, saw 
Juggert hesitate as the ball rolled to the backstop, and attempted to score. 
Juggert recovered the ball and easily tagged Matulik.

KATELLA HIGH JUMPER TAKES A RECORD LEAP

Kevin Carlson of Katella High School had just missed on his first attempt at 7 
feet Saturday night at the CIF state track and field championships, when a 
diminutive girl rounding the Cerritos College track caught his attention. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson's teammate, Martha Pinto, was heading down the homestretch en route to 
a surprising second-place finish in the girls' 3,200 meters. Seconds after 
Pinto finished in a career-best 10 minutes 42.51 seconds, Carlson was at her 
side, hugging her with all the strength his 6-foot-4, 130-pound frame could 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson then sauntered back to the high jump runway, collected himself, and 
with several quick steps, flung his body over the 7-foot barrier without a 
nick. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd of 10,470 cheered, Carlson flopped on the mat then leaped with 
glee, thrilled at the realization he had just broken the Orange County record 
by one-quarter of an inch. Seconds later, Pinto was sprinting to Carlson's side 
to offer a congratulatory hug. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh! I feel like I'm going to faint," said Carlson, who broke the record of 
6-11 3/4 set by Doug Dreibelbis of Foothill in 1983 -- a record Carlson had 
tied earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Geez Louise . . . the first to clear 7 feet! I don't know if I could 
dream of anything better in the world," Carlson said. "At the beginning of the 
year, I was just going for the school record, and now this. And I'm just a 
junior, so I'll be back next year. I love it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime 
thing!" 
</P>
<P>
Riverside North's Avery Anderson, also a junior, also cleared 7-0 Saturday, but 
because Carlson cleared it on his second attempt and Anderson on his third, 
Carlson was awarded the victory. Both tried at 7-1 but missed on their three 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely beyond my wildest dreams," Carlson said. "It's funny 
because we just had our track banquet Thursday and my coach brought out a high 
jump (model) made out of PVC pipe that was 6-11 3/4 tall. He said, 'This is how 
high Kevin jumped.' Now he's got to add a quarter inch to that thing." 
</P>
<P>
While Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith didn't exhibit quite the same exuberance 
in winning the triple jump, his victory and county record certainly added a 
smile to his normally stoic expression. Singbandith's leap of 51-7 3/4 bettered 
the 51- 3/4 county record he set at the Arcadia Invitational April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt about his victory, Singbandith smiled, bowed his head 
slightly, then asked, "How'd Kevin do?" Carlson then came over and the two 
county record-setters exchanged proud smiles and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
As far as depth goes, the county fared best in the shotput, with Esperanza's 
Mark Parlin second (a career-best 62-9), Mark Kinney third (58-3 1/4) and Dana 
Hills' Matt Jordan seventh (54-4 3/4). Dana Hills' Andy Marrone was fifth in 
the discus at 178-3. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer placed third in the 300 hurdles in 43.07, a bit off 
the lifetime-best 42.84 she ran in Friday's preliminaries. Esperanza's Nikki 
Jackson was fourth (43.45). When told of her time, Keffer was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-THREE! Oh my gosh!" she said. "Well then I'm not really happy at all. . 
. . Oh well, I didn't feel all that well anyway." 
</P>
<P>
That feeling was shared by Edison' Shelley Taylor, who was fifth in the girls' 
1,600 in 4:57.20. Taylor, who was disqualified in last year's final after 
colliding with South Hills' Karen Hecox, stayed in contact with the pack for 
the first two laps, but could not seem to generate the strength that had helped 
her to faster times this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to be leading on that (third) lap," Taylor said of her race 
strategy. "But I felt physically like that was the fourth (and final) lap. So 
at that point, I knew that was it. . . . I'm a little upset with the time. I 
mean, 4:57 is nothing to smile about." 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Pinto had everything to smile about after her performance in the 
3,200. Pinto, who unlike most distance runners prefers hot weather to cool, 
said she woke up Saturday morning, saw that it was going to be a hot day and 
gained confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto led the race until there were two laps remaining, when Agoura's Deena 
Drossin, the 1989 state cross-country champion, took the lead for good and won 
in 10:29.60. University's Tanja Brix was third in a career-best 10:49.17. 
</P>
<P>
"I surprised myself, getting second place," said Pinto, who entered the race as 
the slowest of five qualifiers from last Friday's Masters meet. "I thought my 
time would be 10:50 again. I felt good, not tired at all. Everyone was 
breathing so hard and I was just relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
State Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's Tim Martin was fifth in the 100 in 10.75, while Los Alamitos' 
Erik Mitchell was eighth (11.02). Mitchell came back with a better performance 
in the 200 (sixth, 21.73). . . . Esperanza's Clayton Tharrington was fifth in 
the triple jump (47-6 1/4) as was Mission Viejo's Lisa Fager in the girls' 
triple jump (37-6 3/4).

TRANSLATION: A HARD TASK FOR SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRISTINA LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With business picking up overseas, U.S. corporations are spending more money to 
have product brochures, technical documents and business letters translated 
into foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
But with professional translators charging up to $70 per page, having a lengthy 
business document translated can be expensive, especially for a small firm 
trying to crack a foreign market. So some executives have looked for a 
high-tech solution. 
</P>
<P>
For years, computer software companies have tried to develop programs that can 
automatically translate documents into foreign languages. But users complain 
that even the best of these programs offer only minimal translation accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"For certain subjects, such as technical manuals that do not have much flowery 
language or idiomatic expressions, our software can sometimes reach up to 80% 
translation accuracy," said Ernest Marcos of MS Language and Technology, a 
Miami-based company specializing in computer-aided foreign language translation 
service. But he conceded that, for most uses, the software is only about 20% 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
MS Language is one of a handful of companies that make software for language 
translation. MicroTac Software of San Diego markets a program called Language 
Assistant Series. And La Jolla-based Systran Translation Systems Inc. has 
developed a program that has been used by such customers as Xerox Corp., 
Eastman Kodak Co., General Dynamics and Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
The translation goofs made by computer programs can sometimes be humorous -- if 
not the type one would like to make in a business letter. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos recalls using one program from a now-defunct Chicago firm to translate a 
Spanish-language magazine article about pop singer Gloria Estefan's concert at 
New York's Yankee Stadium. The original article in Spanish described the singer 
as seductively taking off her jacket and "teasing" the 20,000 "fans." The 
English version, translated by the software, had Estefan "molesting" 20,000 
"ceiling fans." 
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center Associations of Orange County and Long Beach this month 
began testing a computerized translation service supplied by Computran Systems 
Inc., a Beaverton, Ore., software company. The program translates from English 
to Japanese or Spanish, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
According to executives at Berlitz International, the New York-based language 
school operator, software developers have yet to come up with a program that 
can translate a document the first time with better than 40% to 50% accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are decades away from coming up with a computer system that can give 100% 
accuracy in translating," said Alex Marquez of Cypress-based Iberia Language 
Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never take the human being out of a translation loop. Some people 
argue that machine translation will be impossible because translation involves 
knowledge of the arts, history and everything else. It's not all science."

MAN AND HIS GARDEN SOW SEEDS OF ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Let's take a trip down a stretch of Daphne Avenue in Gardena, a middle-class 
suburb lined with middle-class homes. Look at the neatly trimmed lawns at house 
after house after house. Wait. Off to the left. Something's wrong here. 
</P>
<P>
The front yard is wild with vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
As residents of Daphne push lawn mowers back and forth to create their images 
of the perfect front yard, the vegetation at James Skeie's place continues to 
grow. And GROW. AND GROW. 
</P>
<P>
Rising along with the wildflowers, herbs, shrubs, trees and vines is his 
neighbors' ire. 
</P>
<P>
What he regards as a garden, they see as an unsightly assortment of jungle-like 
weeds that detract from the neat appearance of every other home on the block. 
</P>
<P>
And in what has become a grass-roots battle over what is acceptable for the 
front yard of a home, residents of the block are pressing the city to crack 
down on the Skeies' overgrown greenery. The battle has provoked a spirited 
debate in many of the street's one-story homes about how much freedom a 
property owner ought to have. 
</P>
<P>
"I see Cambodia when I look across the street," said Catherine Nau-Ortiz, who 
has collected 30 signatures on a petition asking the city to order the yard 
cleaned up. "I call it the jungle house." 
</P>
<P>
Nau-Ortiz, a supervisor at a dental supply company, says her neighbor's yard is 
the reason she has not been able to sell her home in a year, despite dropping 
the price $20,000. Prospective buyers, she said, focus more attention on his 
property than hers. 
</P>
<P>
For next-door neighbor Tibor Denes, a cabinetmaker who has lived in his house 
for 25 years, Skeie's yard brings with it health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It draws rats," he said. " . . . If someone chooses to live like this, perhaps 
he doesn't belong here. People like this live in the mountains. This is a 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Skeie, 56, is a tall man with a well-trimmed white beard who has lived at the 
home for about five years. He has had run-ins with neighbors and officials in 
the past over this and other conditions on his property, but the yard has 
always been found within the law. 
</P>
<P>
"I rather despise taking care of a lawn like Joe Blow," he said during a recent 
tour of the property that included an occasional chomp on an herb or two. "Yes, 
it's a little chaotic, but it's naturalistic; it's romantic and it has a lot of 
color." 
</P>
<P>
He sees the yard as an experimental nature preserve, a botany lab for his 
8-year-old daughter, as well as a fruit and vegetable garden. There are dozens 
of different plants on the small plot, including peppermint, strawberries, a 
plum tree, a dwarf elm. 
</P>
<P>
Skeie acknowledged that there had been a rat problem at the property, but rat 
poison has brought it under control. He agreed that the growth "lacks 
definition and boundaries and needs some trimming." He even admitted that his 
plants are probably better suited for the country. But the problem, he said, is 
a lack of understanding by his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very anti-Establishment," said the self-described preacher, teacher, 
collector and real estate agent who now spends much of his time in the garden. 
"I don't want to be offensive to people, but I don't want to be pushed around." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Skeie's neighbors have become his unlikely allies. 
</P>
<P>
"My aesthetics are different from his aesthetics," said Wayne Verrell, an 
insurance claims adjuster. But Verrell did not sign the petition, saying his 
neighbors are too eager to press their values on another. "I've learned to live 
with it. I personally think it looks like a weed garden and needs to be cleaned 
up, but to each his own." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Baxter, an engineer who lives around the corner from Skeie, pondered the 
matter long and hard before finally deciding to add his name to the list of the 
disgruntled. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that anyone who owns a home should be able to do with it what they 
want," he said. "But in his case, I think he's taken that to an extreme. . . . 
I'm thinking, 'Gee, Jim, if you could just trim it a bit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nau-Ortiz and several neighbors have complained to city, fire and health 
officials about the property for several years. Along with the lawn, they are 
fed up with piles of collectibles around the home and an inoperable car in the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
The city prosecuted Skeie in 1988 for storing combustibles and keeping more 
than three rabbits -- Skeie had a dozen. Skeie pleaded no contest, was placed 
on a year of probation and agreed to keep his property up to code. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is we go out and find violations in those areas we have control, 
cite him, and he cleans it up just enough to meet code," City Manager Ken 
Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem has been that there is no city ordinance that specifically bans 
an overgrown yard. Gardena has laws that address fire hazards, health and 
safety violations, vehicles parked on lawns and even overgrown weeds, but city 
officials say the yard does not violate any of those codes. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance before the City Council last month, Nau-Ortiz called on the 
city to pass a property maintenance ordinance that would prevent property from 
becoming a "public nuisance" through inadequate maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Such an ordinance has been proposed in Gardena in the past but has never won 
city approval because council members are worried it might infringe on property 
owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman James Cragin -- who likened Skeie's yard to "a refuse dump that 
someone has planted flowers in" -- has asked the city attorney to bring the 
ordinance back to the council this summer. 
</P>
<P>
All the clamoring has prodded Skeie to take a second look at his garden. 
</P>
<P>
He talks about trying to make peace with the neighborhood by trimming back some 
of the growth here and there. But he doesn't plan to go too far. He vows that 
his yard will never take on the "golf course look" of all the others on the 
block.

HOT RODDER IS ORDERED TO LEAVE THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hot rodder who previously had agreed to stay out of a Torrance neighborhood 
where he allegedly terrorized residents with his driving has been ordered to 
leave Los Angeles County for more than a year after violating his probation in 
another case. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Shane Allabaugh, 21, has until June 15 to get out of the county, under 
a sentence imposed Friday by Torrance Superior Court Judge Cecil J. Mills. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance man agreed to the unusual penalty to avoid a prison sentence for 
violating his probation on a 1988 conviction for breaking into a car. 
</P>
<P>
He must stay out of Los Angeles County until the end of his probation in 
September, 1991, according to a court official. 
</P>
<P>
Allabaugh was found in violation of his probation for burglary in April, when 
he pleaded no contest to 730 charges of disturbing the peace and driving on a 
suspended license in his souped up Volkswagen Beetle. He was placed on 
probation for 275 years on those charges and agreed to be banned for life from 
the Torrance neighborhood, known as the Hollywood Riviera, where the violations 
occurred.

Some boaters in Santa Monica Bay refer to them as giant offshore "icebergs." 
They are as white as snow, often stretch the length of several football fields 
and shimmer in the afternoon sun like a sheet of ice. 
</P>
<P>
But Southern California is not Antarctica, and these floating masses are not 
wayward fragments of pristine glaciers. They are filthy plastic collages of 
discarded cups, straws, lids, bags, food containers, motor oil bottles and the 
like -- a vivid illustration of what environmentalists have identified as the 
nation's most significant marine debris problem. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Center for Marine Conservation, a nonprofit 
environmental group based in Washington, concludes that plastic trash is the 
No. 1 source of debris on beaches from Miami to Santa Monica. A similar study 
conducted by the center in 1988 reached the same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"This trash is fouling our beaches, killing wildlife and costing coastal 
communities a bundle to clean," said Jill Kauffman, the center's Pacific Coast 
regional director, in releasing the study late last month. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, nearly 68% of debris collected and analyzed for the 
survey was some form of plastic, slightly higher than the national average of 
63%. Volunteers, organized by the state Coastal Commission, combed 24 miles of 
the county's 75-mile coastline for three hours last September and submitted 
their findings to the marine conservation center. 
</P>
<P>
On the Westside, they collected data from portions of beaches in Malibu, Santa 
Monica, Venice, Marina del Rey and Playa del Rey. In the South Bay, they 
covered areas of Playa del Rey, Hermosa Beach, Malaga Cove, Royal Palms State 
Beach and Cabrillo Beach. In Long Beach, the data came from several stretches 
of the city's beaches, including the Belmont Shore and Naples areas. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, volunteers covered 358 miles of coastline for the survey, which 
analyzed data from 25 states and territories as well as portions of Mexico and 
Canada. Overall, more than 65,000 volunteers participated in the tally, 
covering 2,946 miles of coastline -- including lakes and oceans -- and 
documenting more than 3 million pieces of debris, according to the marine 
conservation center. 
</P>
<P>
The center will use the survey data to track sources of beach debris -- 
including beach-goers, vessels offshore and specific businesses that use storm 
drains as trash cans -- and attempt to find ways to eliminate them. Center 
officials are scheduled to release a follow-up report later this month with 
proposed recommendations. Another nationwide survey is expected this year, with 
volunteers hitting California beaches on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good educational tool for beach-goers and community residents," 
said Maria Brown, who compiled many of the statistics for the center. "A lot of 
people are calling and asking how they can become involved in beach cleanups." 
</P>
<P>
At beaches in Santa Monica and San Pedro bays, local officials say much of the 
plastic debris identified by the survey is left by beach-goers, who toss aside 
empty suntan lotion bottles, plastic foam cups, fast-food containers and 
beverage bottles. During the hot summer months at Santa Monica beach, one of 
the county's busiest, maintenance crews hauls away 12 tons of garbage on 
weekends, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has gotten worse over the years," said Santa Monica lifeguard Don Spitler, 
who has worked the beaches for more than 30 years. "There are just so many more 
people out there." 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the debris, however, comes from millions of Los Angeles-area 
residents who never set foot on the beach, area environmentalists and 
government officials say. The sprawling plastic "icebergs" that boaters 
encounter offshore are actually collections of litter and garbage that have 
been flushed into the ocean from storm drains, creeks and rivers -- not 
careless sun worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic rubbish mixes with hamburger wrappers, newspapers, soda cans, 
cigarette butts, disposable diapers, bottle caps and other trash that has been 
tossed in streets, gutters and riverbeds as far away as the San Gabriel Valley. 
During heavy rainstorms, the drains and waterways act as huge siphons, dumping 
the debris directly into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper, plastic and Styrofoam that has bunched together in the storm drains 
comes out in one big burp," said Tim Little, community liaison for Heal the 
Bay, an environmental group based in Santa Monica. "It is like one big toilet 
flushing all at once." 
</P>
<P>
In what has become a familiar ritual, cleanup crews from Belmont Shore to 
Malibu last week retrieved thousands of pounds of trash, which rainstorms 
flushed into the bays and from which they were eventually deposited onshore. 
Long Beach maintenance officials said it sometimes takes two weeks to recover 
from the storm-related debris. 
</P>
<P>
"The surrounding beaches look like a snowstorm hit because of all the plastic 
and Styrofoam cups," said Lt. Jerry Shoemaker, a Los Angeles County lifeguard 
in Hermosa Beach. At the UCLA Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey, Stewart Gilbert 
spent much of last week in yellow rubber gloves skimming the water with a large 
fishing net. Gilbert, maintenance supervisor for the boating facility, scooped 
away at what he described as "a blanket of Styrofoam," which had gurgled from 
nearby Ballona Creek, widely regarded as one of the main conduits of marine 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to encourage UCLA students to sail, not go out into a cesspool," 
said Gilbert, who lives in Redondo Beach. "It is just disgusting. We recycle as 
much garbage as we can here. But it sort of makes you feel helpless. There are 
just so many people in this town." 
</P>
<P>
During especially heavy rains, the Los Angeles River, Ballona Creek and some of 
the larger storm drains also transport large -- often bizarre -- chunks of 
trash to the beaches, including refrigerators, stoves, auto parts, couches, 
bedsprings, construction materials and even Christmas trees. Volunteers last 
September reported finding a plastic Santa Claus and sleigh, a blow dryer and a 
prosthetic joint for some unknown limb. 
</P>
<P>
The marine conservation center's report points an accusing finger at what it 
refers to as "land-based sources" of beach debris. The report concludes that 
the general public poses a major threat to beaches and marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"As we learn more about the composition of beach debris, we are finding that 
marine resources are equally threatened by seemingly small, individual actions, 
made serious by their numbers, rather than the volume of each -- like a tossed 
plastic cup or a tangle of fishing line," the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic debris is not only an eyesore for boaters and beach-goers, but local 
and national marine experts say it poses serious hazards to marine life: 
</P>
<P>
Plastic grocery and vegetable bags are often confused for jellyfish and 
transparent plankton, favorite foods for a variety of sea animals, including 
whales, dolphins and turtles. The creatures eat the bags but are unable to 
digest them. Rubber balloons pose a similar risk to the animals, leading Long 
Beach Unified School District and the state of Florida, among other 
jurisdictions, to ban mass balloon releases. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, a dead dolphin washed up in the Huntington Beach area," 
said Little of Heal the Bay. "He seemed fine from all external indications. But 
when they cut him open they found eight pounds of garbage in his gut. He had 
eaten his fill." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic foam cups and food containers, which break up into small foam 
particles, are ingested by sea gulls and other birds, which confuse them for 
tiny invertebrates and other food. The birds eventually choke on the particles. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic rings, used to hold six-packs of soda and beer, have been blamed for 
fish, bird and sea mammal deaths. Fish sometimes become wedged in the rings 
when young, and are sliced to death as they outgrow the rings. Birds sometimes 
get caught in the rings and are strangled, and marine mammals can swallow them 
and choke. As a result, several states -- including California -- have enacted 
legislation requiring that six-pack rings be photodegradable, meaning they 
decompose upon exposure to ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about them that intrigues the animals," said Martin 
Byhower, a Palos Verdes science teacher who collects data for the Center for 
Marine Conservation. "People should cut them before throwing them away." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic bottles become prisons for small marine animals, which die when they 
cannot escape. Last year, volunteers in Monterey County freed a crab that had 
crawled into a plastic soda bottle as a baby and grew too large to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"North America's coastlines and beaches have become a deathtrap for wildlife," 
said Kathryn J. O'Hara, director of the marine conservation center's pollution 
program. "Whales, dolphins, sea turtles and waterfowl by the thousands die each 
year due to the entanglement or ingestion of marine debris." 
</P>
<P>
Although plastic is by far the largest component of beach debris, the marine 
conservation center's survey identified other significant contributors. In Los 
Angeles County, cigarette butts, pieces of paper and glass, metal bottle caps 
and glass beverage bottles were among the top 12 offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said volunteers in California were particularly alarmed by the number 
of cigarette butts they collected. Cigarette filters were not listed as an item 
on data cards provided by the Center for Marine Conservation, but hundreds of 
volunteers tallied them anyway. Nationwide, 164,141 cigarette filters were 
recorded, with nearly one-third of them from California. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear over and over about the cigarette filters," said Jennifer Hightower of 
the state Coastal Commission, which helped administer the survey in California. 
"The beach is not a huge ashtray." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the marine conservation center classify cigarette butts as 
plastic because most filters are made of cellulose acetate, a synthetic 
material. Officials said many people mistakenly believe the filters are paper 
and will degrade rapidly, perhaps accounting for their willingness to discard 
them on beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists generally agree that the long-term solution to the beach 
debris problem lies in eliminating trash at the source. Until then, however, 
cities and counties will continue to pump millions of dollars into cleanup 
efforts designed to minimize the visual blight and ecological damage caused by 
the debris, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The County of Los Angeles, which cleans the vast majority of beaches in the 
county, spends about $3.8 million a year on their maintenance. The county 
employs 75 people year-round for cleanup and an additional 52 during the summer 
months. In the past year, the cleanup crews have also gotten help from 2,022 
inmates assigned to the beach by the Sheriff's Department, 1,146 people 
sentenced by courts to community service at the beach and 637 volunteers just 
wanting to help. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, county crews used 18 tractors, 23 pickup trucks, five trash trucks, 
four dump trucks and a variety of related equipment to clean the beaches and 
haul away 4,000 tons of trash, including rubbish deposited in garbage cans, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are learning to cope with the litter problem on a broad basis, and we are 
learning to hold our own," said Ken Johnson, chief of community services for 
the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. "Overall, the beaches 
are cleaner now than they were certainly 10 years ago, when we had older 
equipment and not adequate staff." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, where the city spends about $1.5 million a year to clean its 
beaches, Beach Maintenance Supervisor Willie McIntyre said his crews sometimes 
feel they are fighting a losing battle. But, McIntyre said, he reminds them to 
keep the debris problem in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are doing maintenance work, trash is one of the key factors in us 
being employed," McIntyre said. "If they stop littering, we will have to reduce 
our staff. I guess you have to have an open mind about the whole thing when you 
are in maintenance." 
</P>
<P>

BEACH DEBRIS 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers combed 24 miles of Los Angeles County beaches for three hours last 
fall as part of a nationwide effort to analyze America's worsening marine 
debris problem. Volunteers collected and recorded the trash they found and 
forwarded their findings to the Center for Marine Conversation in Washington, 
D.C. Recently, the nonprofit group released its analysis of the 860 tons of 
debris collected nationwide, including 103.5 tons in California.

HOT PROPERTY: A BIT OF ENGLAND IN BEL-AIR FOR ACTRESS SEYMOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Jane Seymour and her business manager-husband, David Flynn, have sold 
the house in the Beverly Hills Post Office area that they bought a year ago in 
March from singer Carol Lawrence and are about to start renovating a Bel-Air 
house that they purchased earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep buying homes to fix up and live in, but the (Carol Lawrence) house 
wound up being too big for spending some weekends and other days when they're 
in town," said Jana Jones of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
The Flynns' main U.S. residence is in Santa Barbara, and they also own a couple 
of homes in England, including one in the Mayfair district of London, which 
they just purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"They plan to spend more time in England," Jones said. But the English-born 
actress, whose credits include a starring role in the TV miniseries "War and 
Remembrance," and her American husband will have a touch of England in Los 
Angeles, because they expect to turn their traditional-style Bel-Air house into 
a Country English home, designed by architect Gus Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
The couple also plan to expand the Bel-Air house, which they purchased for 
slightly more than $1.2 million, from 3,500 to about 6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Flynns turned the 6,980-square-foot French Regency they bought from 
Lawrence for $2.25 million, into an 8,000-square-foot Georgian Colonial, also 
designed by Duffy, with red-brick exteriors and white pillars. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Colonial, which has seven bedrooms and six baths, was sold before 
it was listed and landscaping was completed. "The buyers climbed over the dirt 
to look at it," Jones remarked. 
</P>
<P>
It sold, Jones said, for $6 million, a price that a broker from another Beverly 
Hills firm termed "amazing for the area," despite the site's views from 
downtown to the ocean. Jones credits Flynn, whom she describes as "the man with 
the vision." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else would touch that property because it had a gully," she said, "but 
he had the foresight to buy it, fill the gully with dirt and put in a retaining 
wall to create a flat place where a tennis court was built. Because he did 
that, he got the price he did." 
</P>
<P>
The buyer is Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner of Forstmann, Little &amp; 
Co., a New York investment firm formed in 1978 to specialize in leveraged 
buyouts. The home is Forstmann's first in California, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Victoria Principal has listed her Benedict Canyon home at $1.15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-square-foot house, which has three bedrooms and an office that 
Principal used as a gym, is on the market through Rory Barish of June Scott 
&amp; Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The gated home is where Principal and her husband, Dr. Harry Glassman, were 
living last August when they bought a larger house in Beverly Hills for $2.95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken them this long to move into that home, which was built in the 
1940s, because they have been doing major remodeling on it, other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Benedict Canyon home, built in 1966, was Principal's main residence even 
before she and Glassman were married about eight years ago, Barish said. "She 
lived there for 12 years," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Bentley, widow of the founder of Bentley Laboratories in Newport Beach, 
has put her Pebble Beach retreat on the market at $9.5 million. Her main 
residence is on Lido Island. 
</P>
<P>
She and her late husband, Donald James Bentley, bought the 2.67-acre Pebble 
Beach property, with 515 feet of ocean frontage on the 17 Mile Drive, in 1984. 
The two-story contemporary that they built there has seven bedrooms and seven 
baths in about 8,000 square feet, behind 10-foot-tall iron gates. 
</P>
<P>
"They left a couple of walls from the original house but rebuilt the rest and 
just finished it when he died (in April, 1986)," said Mary Sivaslian of Marion 
Buie Realty, Newport Beach, who shares the listing with Deirdre Reade of Fox 
&amp; Carskadon, Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley invented the first disposable oxygenator, used in heart surgery, before 
he sold his company in 1981 to American Hospital Supply Corp. of Chicago for 
$243 million. Later, Bentley Labs was sold to Baxter Labs, also of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace's first Palm Springs home has been leased with an option to buy, said 
Larry Seaward, who put the three-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot house, with a 
piano-shaped pool and a mural depicting the late entertainer and his friends, 
on the market in February at $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was built (in 1958) for (actress) Mae West, but she didn't buy it," 
Seward said. "The people who have leased it, as a vacation home, are Margo and 
Rod West." He's an ABC-TV exec, and they live in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Annabelle Heiferman, who was the mayor of Beverly Hills during the mid-1980s, 
and her husband, Joe, a retired costume jeweler, are now calling Fairbanks 
Ranch home. 
</P>
<P>
The Heifermans bought a New England-style house with a swimming pool and a 
large, enclosed patio in the Rancho Santa Fe community for $1.6 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbanks Ranch, a 2,000-acre development, is now into its second decade. 
Ground was broken in 1980. "The first lot was sold to an old-line Los Angeles 
family," said a spokeswoman for the project, "and the last lot was recently 
sold to an international executive from overseas." 
</P>
<P>
Lots were initially advertised for as low as $175,000; today, lot resales 
average $600,000 to several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
John McCristy of Rancho Santa Fe Acreage &amp; Homes represented the 
Heifermans, and Gary Driver Jr. of Fairbanks Ranch Realty had the listing.

DO YOU NEED A REALTY AGENT TO SELL YOUR HOME?; 
</P>
<P>
HOME SELLERS: IF YOU WORK WITHOUT AN AGENT, YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO HANDLE A 
WIDE RANGE OF LEGAL AND FINANCIAL MATTERS YOURSELF, OR HIRE A LAWYER TO HELP 
YOU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker.

<TEXT>
<P>
Most home sellers are confronted with the dilemma of whether or not to hire a 
real estate agent to market their home. The primary reason for not using an 
agent, of course, is to save the sales commission. For example, on a typical 
home sale of $100,000 with a 6% sales commission, the saving is $6,000. Or is 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Home mortgage lenders report an average of 11 mortgage loans made on sales 
handled by realty agents for every "for sale by owner" (FSBO) sale. There must 
be solid reasons why 11 out of 12 home sellers hire realty agents. But consider 
the pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
Setting the right sales price. After your home is all fixed up and ready to 
sell, the first step is to determine its market value. You may want to hire a 
professional appraiser to prepare a written appraisal. But a double-check with 
local realty agents may be wise, especially in appreciating or declining 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you are thinking of selling without a realty agent, it pays to invite 
at least three local realty agents to evaluate your home's market value, using 
a written "comparable market analysis" form. 
</P>
<P>
Select agents to interview from recommendations by friends and relatives, 
agents who "farm" your neighborhood, and agents whose "sold" signs or newspaper 
ads in your area attracted your attention. Be sure to interview agents with 
both local independent firms and nationally franchised brokerages. What is 
important is each agent's success record, not the name on the door. 
</P>
<P>
Ask lots of questions of each agent about their fees, services, list of client 
references and anything else you want to know. Inform them you are undecided 
about listing your home with an agent and want to know why you should list with 
that agent. 
</P>
<P>
Make each agent persuade you. However, beware of any agent who estimates an 
abnormally high sales price for your home without justifying it. 
</P>
<P>
After each agent has left, phone their references -- the previous sellers -- to 
ask, "Were you in any way unhappy with this agent and would you list your home 
for sale with the same agent again?" 
</P>
<P>
Don't be afraid of young or new agents. They are often eager to succeed and may 
work twice as hard as a longtime salesperson who now may be taking life easy. 
</P>
<P>
Before deciding if you should list your home with an agent and with which 
agent, here are the factors to consider: 
</P>
<P>
Advertising. Can you write newspaper ads about your home? How much will 
advertising cost? Who will answer the phone? What information will you give to 
callers? Will inspections be allowed only during limited hours or will you 
leave work to accommodate an interested caller? 
</P>
<P>
Will you hold and advertise weekend open houses? Do you understand Regulation Z 
Truth in Lending limits on advertising finance terms, such as down payment, 
interest rate and other finance conditions? Are you going to put up a lawn FSBO 
sign? Since you have only one home to sell, how can you compete with the 
hundreds of homes realty agents have available in the multiple listing service? 
</P>
<P>
Financing. Are you familiar with and can you explain mortgage finance terms to 
buyers? Which local lenders offer the best terms and are the easiest to deal 
with? What programs are offered by FHA, VA and state mortgage plans? 
</P>
<P>

'THE HILL': TALE OF FOUR AFFLUENT CITIES; 
</P>
<P>
PALOS VERDES: THE RESIDENTS OF THE PENINSULA ENJOY A SEMI-RURAL LIFESTYLE, 
OFTEN CENTERED ON EQUESTRIAN PURSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the South Bay area of Los Angeles, an address on "The Hill" is a home on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula -- a terraced prow of land at the southwestern tip of 
Los Angeles County that is rural, by Southland standards, and affluent by any 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
What homeowners buy on The Hill is a relaxed, low-key lifestyle, open spaces 
zealously guarded from overdevelopment, isolation from the urban mainstream, an 
idyllic climate and a close sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula's 75,000 residents live in four cities -- Palos Verdes Estates 
(incorporated in 1939), Rolling Hills (1957), Rolling Hills Estates (1957) and 
Rancho Palos Verdes (1973) -- and in two small unincorporated areas spread 
across a diverse physiography that was once submerged under the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Rising slowly to become an island during glacial times, then wave-cut into 
terraces by the sculpting force of the sea, the gap that separated the island 
from the Upper Los Angeles Basin was eventually filled in by sedimentation from 
the mountains to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 27.3-square-mile region of steep, rocky cliffs, rolling hills, 
canyons and wooded glens is one of the Southland's most eagerly sought, and 
expensive, residential areas. The median peninsula home price is $695,000; 
average yearly household income is $94,425. 
</P>
<P>
"The most recent multiple listings . . . for the peninsula showed a 
one-bedroom, 700-square-foot unit at $147,000 in Rancho Palos Verdes as the 
least expensive condominium, said Coldwell Banker real estate agent Edna Steel. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest-priced single-family home listed was a three-bedroom, 
1,300-square-foot residence for $429,000 in Rancho Palos Verdes, where, Steel 
said, the least expensive homes are more likely to be found. 
</P>
<P>
On the high-end price range is a $5.2-million, 8,000-square-foot, six-bedroom 
home with an indoor racquetball court on 2 1/2-acres in Rolling Hills. A close 
second, for $5.1 million, is an estate on the bluff's edge at Malaga Cove in 
Palos Verdes Estates, featuring three koi ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Once the habitat of Gabrielino Indians, the peninsula's beauty and wonders were 
first described by Portuguese explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo in 1542. 
</P>
<P>
Its colorful history harks back to the days of Spanish dons and is closely 
linked to the Dominguez and Sepulveda families, whose vast land holdings -- 
Rancho de los Palos Verdes and Rancho San Pedro -- formed the bulk of the 
peninsula territory. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first developers to settle in Palos Verdes during the 1920s was New 
York financier Frank A. Vanderlip, who envisioned the verdant region as 
California's Riviera, with uncluttered vistas, seaside villages and red-tiled 
villas rimming the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderlip was instrumental in bringing to the peninsula the noted Olmsted 
brothers, leaders in landscape architecture and designers of New York's Central 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Law Olmsted transformed the northern entrance to Palos Verdes Estates 
into an all-year garden and the slopes behind Malaga Cove into 55 acres of 
public parklands, enhanced with masses of eucalyptus, pine and cypress. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, the Palos Verdes Peninsula was isolated from Los Angeles and was 
considered a summer resort destination. But, after World War II, it became the 
favorite year-round residential choice of executives in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the proud equestrian tradition of the Southland's caballeros, residents 
continue to maintain their riding clubs, tack shops and 60 miles of horse 
trails that crisscross the landscape, and for the most part the area still is a 
haven for the horsy set. 
</P>
<P>
However, one resident observed, "It seems the tennis court is now gradually 
replacing the old corral." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, large numbers of Asian residents were attracted to the area 
by its favorable climate and highly rated schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes School District, which serves the entire peninsula, has an 
8,900-student enrollment in its eight elementary, two intermediate, three high 
schools and a continuation school. The private Chadwick School and Marymount 
College are also on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
This enrollment figure, however, reflects a steady decrease during the last 10 
years, in spite of the fact that 90% of district students have gone on to 
higher learning, district spokesperson Nancy Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is due to the high cost of housing. Also, due to Proposition 
13, senior citizens are remaining in the area and not selling their homes and 
moving on to retirement communities as they once did. The overall peninsula 
population now reflects a higher percentage of seniors than before," Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 10 years we have also seen a change in the number of students from 
multicultural backgrounds. Right now, we must have just about every major 
country represented in our student body. 
</P>
<P>
"About 32% of our students are non-Caucasian and the second language of these 
students is predominantly Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Spanish, in that order. 
Of the 8,900 students in our district, 145 are black," Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement for Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos 
Verdes is provided by the Lomita Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Our most recent figures show a reduction in major crime as well as a decrease 
in the number of traffic accidents," said sheriff's Lt. Joseph Lista. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates has had its own police department for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
"For us the main problems are with thefts and burglaries," Police Lt. Ed 
Jaakola said. "But what's significant to our residents, is the quick response 
time by our officers -- 3.1 minutes for priority calls and an average response 
time to all calls for assistance in all categories of 6.8 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates 
</P>
<P>
On entering Palos Verdes Estates, the northwest portion of the peninsula, from 
Hawthorne Boulevard, the visitor is treated to a dramatic change -- transported 
from that congested traffic approach to a pastoral setting with sweeping views 
of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Trees line the curving stretch of Palos Verdes Drive North on the way to Malaga 
Cove Plaza -- a quaint courtyard with its ornate marble fountain, a general 
store, market and offices. Except for a small shopping area at Lunada Bay along 
Palos Verdes Drive West, the plaza is the only commercial center in the city. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 15,000, Palos Verdes Estates maintains a preference for 
Mediterranean-style architecture; 25% of the city's 3,038 acres are dedicated 
to parklands. 
</P>
<P>
Robert and Mary Cooper live in a home that Mary Cooper describes as "not 
spectacular by any means." What counts, she said, "is the beauty and relaxed 
lifestyle of this area." 
</P>
<P>
The Coopers, whose six children were graduated from Palos Verdes High School, 
have benefitted from the soaring appreciation in peninsula property values. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first purchase was a nice tract home on a quarter of an acre in the Rancho 
Palos Verdes area. It cost us $35,000 in 1960. We sold it for $80,000 in 1973; 
today it's worth about $650,000," said Mary Cooper, executive director the 
Palos Vedes Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present home in Palos Verdes Estates was purchased for $90,000 in the 
mid-'70s and its value has risen to about $700,000." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wiesel, a new resident in the area, closed escrow in February on a 
2,600-square-foot home, which he plans to renovate with his bride-to-be, Alysa 
Binder. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was built in the '60s, looks really tired but has a lot of 
potential," said the 34-year-old Wiesel, adding he was able to purchase it in 
the $800,000 range, at the low end of values in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses located above Malaga Cove like Dan's, with . . . views of the Santa 
Monica Bay, are hard to come by and sell for a minimum of $1 million to about 
$5 million," said Jackie Crosby, the listing agent. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesel, who owns a jewelry store in Redondo Beach, lived on the Westside before 
moving to Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, property values in Palos Verdes Estates are comparable to those 
on the fringes of Beverly Hills, in Cheviot Hills and Westwood, but in terms of 
its semi-rural setting and beautiful views, I feel the peninsula has a lot more 
to offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Arman, broker/owner of RE/MAX Rolling Hills Realty, has seen increasing 
residential property acquisition by Asian homeowners as well as investors. "I 
would venture to say that 15% to 20% of the peninsula is now Oriental. 
</P>
<P>
"More than half of our showings on higher-priced properties on the peninsula 
are regularly scheduled for various groups of Orientals," Arman said. 
"Recently, a Tokyo bank picked up the tab on a chartered flight that brought in 
40 prospective buyers to look over our listings throughout the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed them homes listed between $2.5 million and $5.2 million," Arman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills 
</P>
<P>
Realtor Betty Marler has a sticker on the windshield of her car that permits 
her to enter Rolling Hills by one of its four guarded entrances and allows her 
to represent property buyers and sellers within the city's 3 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,110 residents of the community live among the hills and canyons in 
rambling country estates surrounded by white rail fencing. 
</P>
<P>
"Rolling Hills has 26 miles of privately owned streets, 23 miles of equestrian 
trails and 668 individual properties on 1- to 5-acre sites," Marler noted. The 
house must be painted the "approved" white dictated by the rules of the 
homeowners' association, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buenaventura, home of Harriett and Carl J. Ghormley for the past 30 
years, is a ranch-style, two-story main house and guest quarters on a 5-acre 
hilltop site. 
</P>
<P>
"With few exceptions, homes in Rolling Hills are only one story high," said 
Harriett Ghormley, whose life centers on family and community activities and 
the operation of a wedding floral business. 
</P>
<P>
"But our home was built as a two-story farmhouse long before the one-story 
requirement became effective. We love this old house. It's our little island of 
quietness. 
</P>
<P>
"Our neighbors are friendly but our fences are far apart, so we're rarely seen 
chatting over our back yard fences." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills families have traditionally kept horses on their properties and 
the community has spawned a crop of champion equestrians. But, said realtor 
Marler, now less than half of the families own horses. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers still remember the advertising of the 1930s when Rolling Hills 
developers lured buyers from Long Beach, San Pedro and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"For only $15,000," the ads read, "prospective buyers can build a home on five 
acres, have orchards, stables, corral and landscaping." 
</P>
<P>
Today, a 1-acre parcel in Rolling Hills priced at $900,000 would be considered 
a rarity. "And, more than likely, would be a tear-down. Most properties here 
are selling in the millions," the realtor said. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Chen, a native of China, and his wife, Jennie, are soon to become 
residents of Rolling Hills, after they complete the renovation of a 
3,200-square-foot home they recently bought there. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, formerly with Xerox Corp. and now a consulting engineer for Pacific Rim 
firms, lives in a home he purchased in Rancho Palos Verdes in 1985. He had 
previously owned another home in the area for which he paid $49,000, "before 
Rancho Palos Verdes was incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
"The peninsula has always appealed to us. Each time I was transferred and then 
returned to California, I always came back to The Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"I particularly wanted to live in Rolling Hills because the environment is so 
totally different -- it is rural and the security of a gated community is a 
plus. One also gets the feeling of privacy and serenity." 
</P>
<P>
He paid $1.2 million for the Rolling Hills property and expects to spend 
another $1.3 million by the time the home is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not quite what you might call a fixer, but as a businessman, I consider 
both my properties here as an investment, and I'm convinced that the value of 
all properties on The Hill will continue to appreciate," Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who also had resided in Taiwan, has seen a dramatic increase in the Asian 
population on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend among Taiwanese newcomers has been to settle in Monterey Park and in 
Alhambra until they gradually realize that there are other places with perhaps 
more advantages. The prices are much lower here compared to properties in 
Taiwan, where an average condo sells for $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also noticed that many Japanese executives that used to rent are now 
buying because so many major Japanese firms have established American 
subsidiaries on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates, bordered by the city of Torrance to the northeast and 
surrounded by the city of Rancho Palos Verdes to the southeast, may be the only 
Southland community where City Hall has a hitching post for the convenience of 
its constituency. 
</P>
<P>
The city has some of the same characteristics and equestrian lifestyle as 
Rolling Hills, with the difference that it encompasses the Peninsula Center, 
the major commercial area of Palos Verdes, with 1 million square feet of office 
and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Peninsula Center was built in 1960, between Hawthorne and Crenshaw boulevards, 
Silverspur and Indian Peak roads, and has since been extended to include the 
Shops at Palos Verdes, and Courtyard Mall, site of Bullocks Wilshire, the May 
Co., an Ice Capades ice rink and a nine-plex movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
But a stroll along Strawberry Lane, just off Palos Verdes Drive North, gives 
the feeling for what the residential side of Rolling Hills Estates is all about 
-- a country road lined with pepper trees, no sidewalks, no street lights and 
ranch-style homes that typically reflect the rustic lifestyle of its 8,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and Priscilla Regur, owners of a sports store in the area, live in a 
two-story, four-bedroom ranch house on a small private road. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family hobby is horses. Katie, our 15-year-old, attends Rolling Hills High 
School and is a serious equestrian competitor. Our son Andy, 14, attends Malaga 
Cove intermediary school," said Priscilla Regur, member of the Equestrian 
Committee, an advisory group to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is just what we like, with 18 miles of equestrian trails, off-road 
bicycle and jogging paths, a view of downtown and the San Pedro harbor, a 
closeness to Abalone Cove and Torrance Beach, and small enough that we can all 
participate in the decision-making affecting our community." 
</P>
<P>
A startling change, Regur observed, has been the decline in the enrollment in 
schools. Only 15% of the population is of school age, because young families, 
she noted, cannot afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
"Land is at a premium and home prices have risen drastically. We paid $145,000 
for our home in 1978. It is now worth close to $1 million." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Taylor, the city manager, said lots in Rolling Hills Estates average half 
acres and have an agricultural/residential zoning designation. "The city has 
2,700 households, mostly single-family, ranch-type dwellings, no apartments and 
only a few condo units." 
</P>
<P>
Like other communities on the peninsula, Taylor said, Rolling Hills Estates 
contracts for law enforcement, fire services and public works from the county 
and city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes 
</P>
<P>
With its abundance of flowers, fruit and vegetables, Annie Ishibashi's roadside 
stand, operating for the last 47 years across from the glass-enclosed 
Wayfarer's Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, is a "must" stop for peninsula 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
To reach it, you take the southernmost peninsula route along Palos Verdes Drive 
South, Rancho Palos Verdes' main thoroughfare, which hugs a 7.5-mile coastline, 
taking in such landmarks as Point Vicente, Abalone Cove Beach and all of 
Portuguese Bend, and the former site of Marineland of the Pacific, which awaits 
the city's decision on a proposed luxury resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
It's not uncommon in Rancho Palos Verdes as well as other cities on the 
peninsula to see wild peacocks perched colorfully on the rooftops, although the 
presence of the birds apparently is not quite as appealing to local residents, 
who consider them "noisy and a nuisance." The peacocks were first imported to 
the region by early developers. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes, the peninsula's newest and largest city, is home to a 
population of close to 46,000, living in single-family and multifamily 
dwellings in a 4 1/2-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
Annie and James Ishibashi are part of a much earlier community of Japanese 
families who first came to The Hill in the 1920s and '30s to farm. They have 
strong memories of the past and, said one local resident, "Annie and James 
Ishibashi are the peninsula. They are part of the natural, unspoiled image we 
all want to preserve." 
</P>
<P>
The Ishibashi farm, consisting of 30 acres of leased land, is part of the 
Portuguese Bend slide area that James Ishibashi describes as "not buildable but 
growable." 
</P>
<P>
Ishibashi's father, Tomizo, was among a group of Japanese brought in from Japan 
in the early 1900s to work on the railroads and eventually joined his brother, 
who was already farming on the peninsula. "They grew the best tomatoes in the 
world," Ishibashi recalled, and were shipped all the way to Chicago and New 
York by refrigerated freight car. 
</P>
<P>
Ishibashi believes his vegetables are so tasty because of the soil, and where 
it came from. "The whole peninsula was submerged thousands of years ago and it 
contains all sorts of natural elements from the sea that are good for growing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, all the land of Rancho Palos Verdes was unincorporated area of Los 
Angeles County, according to Curtis Williams, the city's planning 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"But as plans for several large developments began to surface, residents in the 
area rallied, pushed for incorporation and won. Today, 91% of housing in Rancho 
Palos Verdes is in single-family homes, 5% in apartments and 4% in condominium 
units." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and his wife, Elaine, both in their 30s, are typical of young couples 
with double incomes who live in apartments in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The going rent for two-bedroom apartments is between $900 to $1,500. Home 
prices range from the mid-$400,000s to the$650,000s. 
</P>
<P>
"Condos, but not too many of them, are priced at just under $350,000, so it's 
not always feasible for younger people in our age bracket to start out owning a 
home on the peninsula," Williams said. "But we love living here." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the advantages of living on The Hill is that the freeways are about 10 
miles away," Williams noted. "The limited access to the peninsula has been a 
plus because we find ourselves sharing its facilities and therefore developing 
a closer relationship with our neighboring cities."

PROGRESS REDEFINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is precisely the self-aggrandizing philosophy expressed in Ted Brown's 
letter of May 20 that has created the environmental crisis that Americans, and 
most especially Southern Californians, find themselves confronted with today. 
</P>
<P>
Far too many are the inconsistencies and hypocrisies in Mr. Brown's diatribe, 
but among the more amusing is his pique at at homeowners who "move somewhere, 
then decide that no one else has the right to live or open a business there." 
</P>
<P>
This when it is the so-called "developers" who attract home buyers to these 
areas with such lures and promises as "secluded," pristine," ad nauseam, and 
then, as soon as the bait is taken and the units are sold, begin systematically 
to destroy the surroundings in the name of progress, which usually means a 
right to unbridled rapaciousness and irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Brown declares that the owners of a property should be able to do with it 
whatever they like. Anyone in a city planning office can tell you what chaos 
would result if that were the case. I, for instance, could not buy the home 
next to Mr. Brown and put in a mini-market, dog kennel, high-rise or an 
assembly plant, no matter how much I would like to. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the environmental disasters of the last decade and a half, progress 
has been made in determining what must be done: what must change if we are to 
survive and live lives that are worth living, both as human beings and as a 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Wealth is not progress. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs per se are not progress: The goal of the work is significant. 
</P>
<P>
Destruction of the landscape is not progress. 
</P>
<P>
It is not people concerned about these all too real isssues who want to turn 
back the clock, but it is Mr. Brown and people like him, who insist upon living 
in the past, with an archaic definition of progress, in a time when resources 
were thought to be infinite, when open space and water and wildlife were 
thought to be limitless.

MIXED-USE DRAWS MIXED REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: "It's Back to the Future: Living Over the Store" by Larry Kosmont (May 20). 
</P>
<P>
Kosmont believes that elected officials are encouraging or compelling retail 
(commercial) developers to include low-cost housing in their projects -- 
so-called "mixed use" -- out of concern for the shortage of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
He states, "the prime motivation for housing linkage programs is the severe 
shortage of low-income housing units in most metropolitan areas." 
</P>
<P>
I think "mixed-use" has nothing to do with the affordable housing crisis 
because the amount of affordable housing generated is trivial compared to the 
overall need. 
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor's 1988 housing report, 4,000 affordable housing units 
are demolished each year, and the demand for housing outstrips supply by 14,000 
units a year, (not 11,000 units, as Kosmont indicates), yielding a need for 
18,000 new affordable units a year in Los Angeles. The report states that an 
additional 68,000 affordable housing units will be lost due to expiring HUD 
covenants and earthquake renovation of brick buildings. 
</P>
<P>
For comparison, let's look at the two largest mixed-use, jobs/housing balance 
developments to hit Los Angeles for their affordable housing yield. On the 
Westside, Playa Vista will provide 1,760 units "for people of average income" 
(Los Angeles Times, Jan. 29); and Porter Ranch will provide 600 affordable 
units (Los Angeles Times, Dec. 16, 1989). This yield is insignificant compared 
to the yearly need documented in the mayor's report. 
</P>
<P>
In my view, mixed-use is simply another way of packaging and selling 
detrimental high-intensity, traffic-generating uses that maximize profits for 
the developer and minimize the risk of opposition from "reasonable growth" 
forces in the community: It is difficult to oppose a commercial project that 
includes affordable housing; it's akin to opposing motherhood and the American 
way.

COMMERCIAL REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a professional in commercial real estate, I would like to address the 
virtual disappearance of commercial real estate reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, with the new residential focus, the section enjoys a much broader 
readership among subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
However, those of us in the commercial sector can't help but be disappointed. 
Given that Southern California is one of the strongest commercial real estate 
markets in the country, it would seem that it merits more attention than the 
sporadic appearance of the one-half page "Commercial Scene" column.

THE SMALL INVESTOR: BE WARY OF PROMOTIONS OFFERING DEALS ON RECREATIONAL HOME

QUESTION: What do you think of buying vacant land as an investment? While on 
vacation recently, I saw a newspaper ad for home sites near a nice fishing 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
The utilities and roads are already in. The price is very reasonable and with 
only a $2,500 cash down payment, the developer will finance the mortgage at 
zero interest for 10 years. What do you think of this deal? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Please, please, please be very cautious. If you purchase in a 
recreational development, you are not buying an investment. The only person who 
will probably make a profit is the developer. Chances of any resale profit for 
you are virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
I would rather be optimistic, but the truth is, most recreational land 
developments are not successful. The losers are the buyers who usually default. 
The developer re-acquires the properties to resell again. And again. And again. 
</P>
<P>
I hope you get my drift. Investigate carefully. If you decide to buy, please 
use money you can afford to lose. Then you can be pleasantly surprised if 
everything turns out well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Deduction for Lost Rents Not in the Cards 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a strip shopping center in a rough part of town. Only two of my six 
stores are occupied. Can I claim a casualty loss tax deduction for my lost rent 
on the four vacant stores? Due to the high crime rate in the vicinity I can't 
get any decent storekeepers to move in. 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but you cannot deduct your lost rent on your income tax returns. 
However, you can continue depreciating the vacant stores even though they are 
not bringing in rental income. Please consult your tax adviser for further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figuring the Value of Apartment Building 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently inherited a large amount of money and would like to buy an 
apartment building. Several real estate agents have shown me many apartment 
buildings that are for sale in my town. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm confused about gross multipliers. They have shown me buildings with 
gross multipliers ranging from 6 to 10. Which is the correct gross multiplier? 
</P>
<P>
A: None of the above. Forget you ever heard those words gross multiplier. 
</P>
<P>
Gross multiplier means the gross rent of a rental property is multiplied by a 
number to obtain the building's asking price. For example, suppose an apartment 
building produces $50,000 annual gross rent. If a gross multiplier of eight is 
used, the asking price would be $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, the big defect of gross multipliers is they don't consider the 
building's operating expenses and its vacancies. A better approach is to 
capitalize the building's net operating income. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose an apartment building produces $20,000 annual net 
income. Dividing by a capitalization rate of 10% produces a $200,000 market 
value. But a 9% "cap rate" results in a higher $222,222 market value. The lower 
the cap rate investors are willing to accept, the higher the property value. 
</P>
<P>
To find out the cap rate in your community, divide the net income by the recent 
sales prices of similar nearby apartment buildings. Your real estate agent can 
obtain that information for you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Lose Money Fast in Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
Q: Although I look forward to your upbeat columns, why don't you warn readers 
they can also lose money in real estate? 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, my wife and I sold our home, used that $125,000 old 
folks' tax exemption for our profits, and bought a 22-unit motel. 
</P>
<P>
We worked there day and night, never taking a vacation because we couldn't get 
anyone to manage it so we could take a few days off. 
</P>
<P>
Unknown to us, before we bought the only nice motel in a modest-size town, 
Holiday Inn was planning to build a fancy big new hotel just down the 
interstate highway from us. When it was finished, they took almost all our 
business and we had to reduce our rates to keep going. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were lucky to sell out at a loss of over $100,000. Please 
warn your readers real estate isn't always profitable. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for sharing your sad experience. Longtime readers of this column 
know motels, hotels, boardinghouses, bed-and-breakfast inns, and other 
labor-intensive acquisitions are real estate-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
They definitely are not real estate investments, such as rental houses, 
apartments, shopping centers and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
I hope reading about your situation will help others from making the same 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation is the Real Estate Investor's Friend 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own several apartment buildings that have substantially appreciated in 
market value since I bought them 10 to 15 years ago. I have positive cash flows 
and have enjoyed thousands of dollars of income tax savings. But I am concerned 
that the buildings might decline in value if the inflation rate keeps rising. 
Do you think I should sell now? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why sell -- unless you have a very good reason such as a better investment 
opportunity or you think property values will decline due to adverse economic 
influences such as high unemployment? 
</P>
<P>
If you are worried about inflation, remember that inflation is real estate's 
friend. The market value appreciation rate on most sound, well-located 
properties usually outpaces the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, don't forget the benefits of leverage. Chances are you bought your 
properties with 10% to 20% cash down payments. Even if your properties 
appreciate in value just a few percent each year, your return on invested 
dollars is probably at least 20% to 30%, often more. If you know of a better 
investment, please let us know. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you had a huge speculative profit, my advice would be different and 
I would recommend you sell.

AVOID, CURE PROBLEMS WITH EXTERIOR PAINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually it's the paint itself that gets the blame for paint problems on your 
home's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
But in most cases the cause lies elsewhere. Here are some common problems and 
ways to prevent them. 
</P>
<P>
Blistering is the earliest stage of peeling and is usually caused by moisture 
trapped under the new paint coat or by poor surface preparation. 
</P>
<P>
If it occurs within the first few weeks, it's probably caused by trapped 
moisture. While latex paint can usually be applied to damp surfaces without any 
problem, alkyd and other oil-based paints form a moisture barrier skin that 
traps the water inside. The water then turns to vapor and forms blisters. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this, never paint with alkyds after a rainstorm, when the relative 
humidity is more than 85%; while dew is on the siding, or too soon after you've 
washed the old surface. Also, never paint when the temperature is more than 90 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
If the blisters appear after a month or so, the problem is probably poor 
surface preparation. If you washed the surface down with detergents, did you 
take the time to rinse completely? Unless such films are removed before 
painting, they can cause blistering. Also, glossy surfaces must be given a 
light sanding, so the new paint will grip well. 
</P>
<P>
Peeling is the curling of large pieces of dried paint and is merely a later 
manifestation of blistering. Severe peeling may also indicate use of a poor 
primer, or a heavy film of dirt, grease or dust. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention involves sanding or wiping the old finish with a deglossing liquid. 
Then follow the manufacturer's directions as to what primer may be required 
before applying the top coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Alligatoring is a cracking and flaking of the paint in a square pattern. It can 
result from applying paint over a previous coat that had a high gloss finish 
that was not sanded, use of the wrong primer or use of old paint, particularly 
paint that's been stored in an unheated space and allowed to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
To repair the condition, sand the surface smooth and apply the proper primer 
before applying a new top coat. 
</P>
<P>
Checking is a series of long lines, with shorter check marks crossing between, 
usually caused by the wood underneath expanding and contracting. This can be a 
problem with exposed plywood siding regardless of the kind of paint used. 
</P>
<P>
Sanding and then applying a new coat of wood primer will usually solve the 
problem. But if the new paint shows signs of coming loose, complete removal of 
the old paint is required. 
</P>
<P>
Wrinkling results in a crinkled surface that is caused by interfering with 
required drying time. Contributing factors are too-thick finish coat, building 
up of too many layers, undercoat that was not completely dry, wrong solvent or 
improperly stirred paint. Repair by sanding smooth and applying proper primer 
before painting top coat. 
</P>
<P>
Chalking or powdering characteristics are designed into some paints in order to 
keep the surface looking new. Chalking of old paint can interfere with proper 
bonding of a new coat, so scrub off as much as possible beforehand. In severe 
cases you may have to apply a bonding primer or sealer. 
</P>
<P>
Mildew manifests itself as patches of black spots. Though most exterior paints 
contain mildew-inhibiting ingredients, none work under all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Remove mildew by washing down the affected area with a bleach solution. Use 
one-third cup powdered laundry detergent, two-thirds cup of household cleaner 
containing trisodium phosphate, and one quart of household bleach. Wear long 
pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, goggles and a respirator to avoid 
breathing the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Stains that bleed through the paint are often the result of sap from knots in 
the wood seeping through the surface. But they also can be caused by rust from 
nails and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Many discolorations bleed through coat after coat of paint, so repainting alone 
is not the answer. Instead, apply a primary coat of stain killer, such as 
pigmented shellac-base sealer, and then apply your paint.

TIPS ON REWIRING ALUMINUM FRAME WINDOWS; 
</P>
<P>
HOME REPAIR: CHANGING THE SCREEN MESH IN YOUR WINDOWS CAN BE EASY AND 
RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and a free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, spring! Long, warm days. Balmy nights. Baseball, barbecues, beach parties 
and, of course, bugs . . . lots of miserable bugs! 
</P>
<P>
But don't despair. Here are some tips for easy rewiring of aluminum-frame 
windows and door screens that will allow you to beat the bugs without beating 
your wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Start by determining what type of screen mesh you have in the existing frame, 
either aluminum, which is stiff, or fiberglass, which is soft and pliable. 
</P>
<P>
In general, it is easier to rewire screens with new mesh of the same material 
as the old mesh. From most any hardware store or screen shop, purchase enough 
aluminum or fiberglass mesh to overlap the outside edges of the frame. 
</P>
<P>
Also while you're at the store, buy a device called a "spline tool," which 
looks like a pizza cutter with a wheel at both ends (under $5). One wheel has a 
convex edge, the other a concave edge. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to remove the old mesh from the screen frame. Lay the screen 
on a flat surface and with a pair of long-nose pliers or tweezers, pull on the 
end of the "spline," the rubber cord in the frame groove that surrounds the 
mesh. 
</P>
<P>
Continue pulling the spline until you have removed it entirely. Put the spline 
aside and remove the old screen mesh from the frame. 
</P>
<P>
Lay the new mesh evenly over the screen frame. If you are working with aluminum 
mesh, use the convex-edged wheel of the spline tool to push the material as far 
as possible into the groove all the way around the frame. 
</P>
<P>
Here comes the key to successful rescreening. Starting at any corner of the 
frame, use the concave wheel of the spline tool to force the old spline 
material into groove on top of the screen mesh. Use enough force to push the 
screen and spline down into the groove as far as possible. 
</P>
<P>
If the spline is especially difficult to force in, try pulling on the free 
section to stretch it, causing it to "thin" slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Continue working across to the opposite corner of the frame and cut the spline 
there with a wire cutter or knife. 
</P>
<P>
Now you have one side of the frame completed. To keep the mesh taught, draw it 
snug over the frame and repeat the above procedure at the opposite side. 
</P>
<P>
The screen mesh should now be smooth and flat without loose spots or wrinkles. 
If so, complete the spline installation for the two other sides of the frame. 
If not, pull the spline out of the groove near any wrinkles or loose sections, 
straighten and tighten the mesh, and reinstall the spline. 
</P>
<P>
Now the screen mesh is properly secured into all four sides of the window or 
door frame with the excess mesh still attached. To remove it, hold the flat 
part of the blade of a utility or pocket knife against the spline, with the 
sharp edge against the loose mesh. 
</P>
<P>
Draw the knife along the spline while cutting through the loose material all 
the way around the frame. 
</P>
<P>
That's it! The screen is like new, and you did it yourself! 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a word about aluminum versus fiberglass mesh. As stated above, it is 
usually easier to rewire a screen with new mesh of the same material as the 
old, but you may wish to switch from aluminum to fiberglass or vice versa to 
better suit your needs. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum screen mesh is sturdier than fiberglass and is better for doors or 
window screens that are subject to assault from pets, kids and careless adults 
who may be prone to pushing on the mesh rather than the handles. 
</P>
<P>
Fiberglass mesh is a little cheaper, is more resistant to weathering and is 
corrosion proof. Fiberglass is preferable in coastal areas or in humid 
climates. 
</P>
<P>
Two switch mesh types, the spline will normally need to be replaced. Buy one 
size smaller to go from fiberglass to aluminum; one size larger to go from 
aluminum to fiber.

WATER HEATER: HOME'S MOST BORING APPLIANCE; 
</P>
<P>
UPKEEP: WHEN IT DOES GET EXCITING, IT MAY RUN OUT OF HOT WATER, SPRING A LEAK, 
OR IN WORST CASE, BLOW UP. BUT PREVENTION IS SIMPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND, Los Angeles Times Syndicate

<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, your water heater would seem to be the most boring appliance 
in the whole house. And it doesn't gain any excitement value at second or third 
glance, either. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way you want it. Because when a water heater isn't boring you to 
tears, it can get real exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Examples include giving out when you're taking a hot shower or springing a leak 
in the middle of the night, as mine did a few weeks back. But the real topper 
is when it overheats and explodes like a terrorist bomb, ripping your house 
apart in the process. 
</P>
<P>
So all in all, it's in your best interest to make sure your water heater 
remains boring. Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, make sure it has a temperature/pressure relief (TPR) valve. 
This sits on top of your water heater and looks something like a little faucet 
with a flip-up lever on it. In most modern installations it will stand by 
itself as shown in the sketch, although sometimes it may be connected to the 
hot water outlet via a tee. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a drain line will be connected to the valve. This should run down to 
near floor level as shown or to a floor drain, but never outdoors where it 
could freeze up and become clogged with ice. 
</P>
<P>
If your heater doesn't have a TPR valve, have one put in. If you do have a 
valve, make sure it is working properly. To do this, flip the little lever up. 
This should release a flow of water (catch this in a bucket if you like) 
flushing the valve clean in the process. 
</P>
<P>
When you release the lever, the valve should close. If you get no flow, or the 
valve won't close properly, it is clogged or defective and should be replaced 
immediately. Make this simple check at least twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
Prolonging tank life. This is pretty simple. First of all, realize that 
corrosion is accelerated by heat. The hotter you set your tank, the faster it 
will corrode. So set the thermostat as low as practical. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to do this is let your dishwasher be the judge. Dishwashers need 
fairly hot water (about 120 degrees) to work effectively. So, every few days, 
lower the water heater thermostat a few degrees. Keep this up until your 
dishwasher no longer cleans the dishes, then turn the thermostat back up a few 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Some dishwashers have built-in heaters to make sure their water supply is 
hot enough. In this case, let your shower be your guide. If you can't get your 
shower hot enough, or you run out of hot water too quickly, turn the water 
heater back up a few degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to help prevent corrosion is to flush your tank a couple of times a 
year. Do this by hooking up a hose to the bottom drain valve (see sketch) and 
draining off a few gallons of water. This will flush out any scale or other 
mineral deposits on the bottom of the tank, slowing down corrosion, and often 
curing any popping noises coming from the tank. 
</P>
<P>
If you still find yourself rusting out a tank every few years, your problem is 
probably minerals or a high acid content in your water. My own well water is so 
acidic that my last water heater started leaking in just two years. 
</P>
<P>
The cure was to install an acid neutralizer. This is essentially a fiberglass 
tank filled with a bed of calcium carbonate or magnesium oxide. As the water 
passes through this bed, it is neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
This not only protects your water heater, it does the same for the rest of your 
plumbing system, so pipes and valves should last longer. And with acid no 
longer eating away at your plumbing system, you'll probably find your water 
tastes better. 
</P>
<P>
One last corrosion cure. If you've had corrosion problems in the past, you 
might consider having your plumber check the tank's sacrificial anode. Not 
shown in the sketch, this is simply a rod of magnesium about 3 or 4 feet long 
immersed in the tank. It's designed to corrode on purpose, instead of the tank, 
but once it is nearly eaten away, it can no longer do its job. In that case, 
you can have it replaced. 
</P>
<P>
That done, you can focus your attention on one of your more exciting 
appliances, like that electric fondue pot you got as a wedding present.

IMAGINATION CAN BRING NEW LIFE TO OLD HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
RESTORATION: CONSIDER THE NEIGHBORHOOD, ZONING, PROPERTY TAXES AND DEFECTS 
BEFORE REHABILITATING A DERELICT STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A derelict house can be turned into a treasure with a combination of 
imagination and sound planning. 
</P>
<P>
The first step is to find a restorable old structure, according to an article 
in House Beautiful, and for this you need imagination and information. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to use your imagination to visualize what a restorable old 
structure will look like when it is rehabilitated, remodeled or renovated. Then 
move on to the facts. 
</P>
<P>
You will need an inspection engineer for an in-depth report on the condition of 
the structure, but there are some simple things you can look for yourself that 
will allow you to make a quick go or no-go decision. 
</P>
<P>
Look around the neighborhood. Would you like to live here? Who will your 
neighbors be? If there are people who have already renovated a home, talk to 
them. Talk to lenders who may be pushing for rehabilitation in the area, and 
talk to your broker if you used one. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning is another factor. Zoning is supposed to keep residential neighborhoods 
residential, business neighborhoods business and industrial neighborhoods 
industrial. But often, spot zoning that mixes business and residential is 
allowed. In the country, zoning is just as important. Do you want a gas station 
built next to your restored farmhouse? 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes are a consideration. They usually are based on the property's 
value and can be escalated drastically as a neighborhood or dwelling improves. 
Some locales, to encourage rehabilitation, promise low or no tax increase. Call 
your county tax agent or have your broker find out what your taxes are and what 
they will be when your project ends. 
</P>
<P>
If your old structure meets these criteria, look for obvious defects before 
calling in an inspection engineer -- serious fire damage, severe sagging of the 
roof, severe leaning of a wall or walls, crumbling or wide cracks in the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Buy the worst in the best neighborhood. The lowest-priced house in a 
neighborhood appreciates fastest and is more assured of appreciation. You 
should always think of the resale value of a house, and the most expensive 
house in the neighborhood is usually the hardest to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Once you decide to undertake major remodeling, restoration or rehabilitation, 
you need a master plan that includes blueprints showing the dimensions of each 
finished room and specifications that describe the materials to be used. Based 
on cost considerations, the master plan will determine what the blueprints and 
specifications will be. 
</P>
<P>
If walls are to be moved or eliminated, you will need the advice of an 
architect or architectural designer. Structural defects can be remedied on 
their advice and on the inspection engineer's report.

REMODELING PAYMENTS REGULATED IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In California, home improvement payments -- including down payments paid to the 
contractor by the owner -- are regulated by law, according to the National 
Assn. of the Remodeling Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Section 7159 of the California contractors' license law provides when the 
payment schedule calls for a down payment that the down payment be no more than 
$1,000 or 10% of the contract price, whichever is less. Exceptions are made for 
deposits for one-of-a-kind or special-ordered products. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California chapter of the national remodeling trade association 
cautions against consumers being "lured into giving large deposits in exchange 
for big discounts" on their remodeling projects.

THE COLLECTION ENTERS REALTY MAGAZINE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yet another California realty firm has introduced a glossy magazine to market 
its houses around the world and to reinforce recognition for its new name. 
</P>
<P>
Entitled The Collection, the full-color magazine will be sent free to 60,000 
potential buyers, sellers and agents three times this year by Century 
City-based Prudential California Realty. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the copies will be hand-delivered to Californians, according to George 
Rathman, chairman of Prudential California, known until last November as 
Merrill Lynch Realty. 
</P>
<P>
"Aggressive new sales approaches have become a necessity in California today, 
with the slowing of the sales pace," Rathman said. "The magazine also gives our 
firm greater name recognition, although that wasn't the primary reason for 
starting it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The distribution of 50,000 copies of each issue in California is the largest 
and most selective of any real estate showcase magazine distributed in the 
state, according to Rick Merrill, president of Prudential California's central 
region. 
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 copies have been delivered to wealthy households in Southern 
California -- where most of Prudential California's 79 offices are located -- 
with about 5,000 copies going to similar Northern California households. About 
8,500 copies have been provided to more than 4,200 Prudential California sales 
associates in California. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is associated with Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, based in Costa 
Mesa, Rathman said. The Prudential, a Newark, N.J.-based insurance and 
financial services firm, is the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of The Collection has 112 pages of photographs and descriptions 
of 266 California houses from Eureka to San Diego, priced from $142,950 to $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Predecessors of the publication include Fine Homes, published by Merrill Lynch 
Realty, and The Collection, started about 10 years ago by Rodeo Realty, 
according to Merrill. Rodeo Realty is a Prudential California unit that markets 
houses priced at $1 million and up on the Westside, 
</P>
<P>
Prudential California realtor/associates are charged $150 for each house 
illustrated and described in the new magazine, Merrill said. He added that 
$500,000 has been budgeted this year for the publication. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research has shown that single-purpose magazines devoted to housing do the 
best job in reaching prospects, both potential buyers and potential sellers," 
Merrill said. "We're going to translate portions of the magazines into Japanese 
and Chinese for distribution by Mitsui Real Estate in Japan and Shin Yih in 
Taiwan, as well as Prudential Bache International in Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Pivnicka of the Roulac Real Estate Consulting Group, San Francisco, 
said that the cost of producing and distributing the magazine will be worth it 
if it identifies the renamed Prudential California as a major player in the 
lucrative California prestige realty scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I give them a lot of credit for clever niche marketing," she said. "What 
they're trying to do is capitalize on a proven direct marketing technique: 
Going after upscale buyers and sellers." 
</P>
<P>
The Collection comes less than a year after Jon Douglas Co. launched Properties 
International, a glossy quarterly magazine that showcases properties in the 
$1-million-and-up range. A spokeswoman for the Beverly Hills-based Douglas firm 
said that Properties International is still being published, with about 15,000 
copies of each magazine printed, priced at $10 a copy. 
</P>
<P>
Properties International is produced by Prime Publishing Co. Inc., Santa 
Barbara, which also publishes the six-times-a-year Prime Real Estate magazine, 
according to publisher Donald V. Fritzen. Prime Real Estate's circulation is 
about 41,000 and each copy sells for $3.95. Prime Publishing also produces 
about five or six other "private title" real estate magazines similar to 
Properties International. 
</P>
<P>
"Private title magazines are used as listing tools, to differentiate one realty 
firm from another in a market crowded with prestige firms," Fritzen said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Southland-based private title magazine, Great Estates Limited Editions 
Magazine, has been published for three years and showcases prestige houses 
throughout the nation, marketed by more than 60 "carriage trade" real estate 
brokers around the nation, according to publisher Kay Coughlin, of Great 
Estates Inc., Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The current 92-page issue -- the magazine appears twice a year and is largely 
distributed free to affluent potential buyers and sellers -- has Southland 
houses marketed by firms in areas such as Beverly Hills, San Marino, Santa 
Barbara, Palm Springs, Woodland Hills, Laguna Beach and Rancho Santa Fe.

IT'S 'TENANT BEWARE' IN VACANCY ERA; 
</P>
<P>
LEASING: WITH OFFICE SPACE GOING BEGGING, EXPERTS ADVISE THOROUGH PLANNING, 
EVEN WHEN USING 'PLAIN ENGLISH' FORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Democracy may finally be arriving in the complex and sometimes contentious area 
of commercial lease negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Big tenants have always had the money and time to ensure that they get a fair 
deal out of landlords. Smaller tenants, however, have not always been so 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, independent operators have been forced to accept leases replete 
with fine print and obtuse language drafted by building owners and their 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But landlords anxious to fill vacant space, well-educated tenants and new lease 
forms are changing the commercial scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, for example, has introduced what 
its calls a "plain English" lease. It's designed to reduce landlord-tenant 
disputes with a summary of major lease points on the first page, generous 
spacing to allow for easy modification and simple, readable language. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups are following suit and attempting to create pre-written leases 
that give tenants more of a fair shake than they've enjoyed before. Tenants 
looking for commercial space today -- be it in an office building or a 
mini-mall -- are also finding that high vacancies nationally and in California 
have strengthened their hand. 
</P>
<P>
Smart shoppers who ask the right questions stand to benefit. But just what are 
the right questions? Here's some advice that applies to big and small 
commercial tenants alike, courtesy of some of L.A.'s most consulted real estate 
brokers and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Many landlords today are offering free rent or hefty cash rebates for a signed 
lease. Obviously, these perks carry a price tag that is often buried somewhere 
else in the lease. What may seem like a good deal in the first year can turn 
out to be a terribly bad deal in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Besides some of the more obvious areas of negotiation such as rent, lease terms 
and number of parking spaces offered, a few overlooked clauses can be 
particularly troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
* Continuous operation clauses. These may oblige a tenant to stay in business 
even if he or she is losing money. Landlords like including such requirements, 
especially in retail leases, because it helps them avoid empty stores. 
Landlords want more than rent, they want a retail center that looks successful 
while providing them with a cut of operating income. 
</P>
<P>
While some stores may prefer to close because of net losses, landlords may 
prefer that a business stay open and continue to generate revenues on which the 
landlord's percentage is usually based. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants have to carefully qualify landlords just as landlords qualify their 
tenants, attorneys caution. 
</P>
<P>
When a building is about to get sold, tenants should beware, for such a change 
means an increase in property tax assessment. If the lease allows for property 
tax pass-throughs, the tenant may be left paying the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, some tenants could find themselves behind a long list of creditors 
if their landlord fails financially. Promises of improvements to the building 
hinge on the well-being of the promissor, too. 
</P>
<P>
* Assignment and subletting. This has become another tough area of negotiation 
for many landlords and tenants. Landlords, obviously, don't want tenants 
subletting or assigning their space at will. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, tenants want the flexibility to move on or move out without a 
giant, long-term liability. In California, the Legislature affirmed last year a 
landlord's right to withhold consent -- even unreasonably -- on assignment or 
subletting. 
</P>
<P>
That means that if a landlord puts such a clause into a lease, he or she can 
refuse under any circumstances to allow transfer of a lease and its 
obligations. It's perfectly legal, and can land an unwitting tenant in lots of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
* Escalator clauses. This is another way to make up for cheap rent in the early 
stages of a lease. Sometimes these are merely increases tied to athe Consumer 
Price Index. Or, these clauses can significantly change the net cost of the 
lease by allowing 5%, 10% or even 15% increases in rent or other expenses 
annually. Such clauses, said office broker James H. Travers, "get buried and 
tenants later pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Added pass-through costs -- such as for insurance, cleaning up toxic 
substances, providing new landscaping or remodeling a lobby -- may also be 
borne by the tenant who signs without doing all his or her homework. The 
result, warned Travers, is that "the tenants are getting hurt because they 
don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
* Tenant improvement (TI) clauses. Westside attorney Paul Rutter warns tenants 
that these clauses can make or break a lease. What gets included in tenant 
improvement allowances? Some landlords provide for fully finished space, while 
others don't even throw in such basics as wiring, or heating and air 
conditioning ducts. Each of these items must be separately enumerated in the 
lease, he said. To do otherwise is to invite conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant tenants may be surprised to find that their landlord has written in 
a right to approve menus. And, many leases restrict the operations of a tenant 
to make sure there's no competition within a complex. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the question of how disputes will be resolved? Some contracts 
have built-in arbitration and/or mediation clauses, the former imposing a third 
party's decision and the latter obliging the landlord and tenant to find some 
middle ground. Depending on the circumstances, these options may or may not be 
particularly attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson in all this is caveat emptor -- buyer (or in this case lessee) 
beware. What tenants and landlords don't take the time to discuss now, say 
veteran negotiators, is an open invitation to confusion and acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENTS: Parties Sign Lease for Civic Center Project 
</P>
<P>
Developers of the much-delayed First Civic Center office tower (formerly called 
One Civic Center) in downtown Los Angeles moved a step closer to realizing 
their plans by signing a 66-year ground lease for a land parcel at Broadway and 
1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
Raffi Cohen Industries and Melvin Simon &amp; Associates plan to build the 
Civic Center's only private commercial building -- a 21-story, 
610,000-square-foot structure -- on land leased from the county and state. 
Ground breaking is expected between late 1990 and mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
The project's 4.6-acre site was that of the Los Angeles State Office Building 
from 1931 until 1971. Damaged in the Sylmar earthquake, the state building was 
demolished in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few blocks away, at Spring and 3rd streets, workers are completing the 
new Ronald Reagan Building -- a fortress-like 850,000-square-foot behemoth that 
will bring together 30 currently dispersed state agencies. Work is also under 
way at Temple and Alameda streets on a new 1.28-million-square-foot federal 
building, and the city of Los Angeles has office building plans in the works in 
the civic center area too. 
</P>
<P>
Besides developing First Civic Center, RCI and Melvin Simon are partners in 
Figueroa Plaza, a 600,000-square-foot office project just north of 1st Street 
on Figueroa. The project's south tower, which is home to Imperial Bank, is 
being joined with a twin north tower, set for completion late this year. The 
developers are also negotiating with the city for rights to build the 58-story 
RCI Tower at the southeast corner of 9th and Figueroa in the area of downtown 
known as South Park. 
</P>
<P>
As part of yet another 66-year lease executed by Los Angeles County, Fremont 
Development Co. will soon begin construction on the 35-acre Rancho Business 
Center industrial development within the Rancho Los Amigos Medical Complex in 
Downey. The $22 million project will include 640,000 square feet of commercial 
space, including a facility leased by Kirk Paper through leasing agent the 
Charles Dunn Co. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials estimate that this project will generate between 
$600 million and $800 million in public revenues over the term of Fremont's 
66-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill is soon to be home to a new $100-million InterContinental Hotel at 
251 S. Olive St. Work on the 17-story, 469-room building started this month and 
completion is expected in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is being developed by California Plaza Hotel L.P., a limited 
partnership consisting of Bunker Hill Associates and Toboshima Development Co. 
as general partners and Nippon Landic USA Inc. and Seiyo Corp. as limited 
partners, in collaboration with the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Bunker Hill Associates is backed by Metropolitan Structures West Inc., 
developers of the 11.5-acre California Plaza, which when completed in the 
mid-1990s, will include three office towers in addition to 750 residential 
units and the Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Also under way is the $80-million World Trade Center Hilton in Long Beach. The 
15-story hotel, featuring 393 rooms, is scheduled for completion in about 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
IDM Corp., Kajima International Inc. and Matsushita Real Estate Ltd. are 
developing not just the hotel but a total of 2.5 million square feet of 
mixed-use space, including an existing 27-story office, retail and conference 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The Concourse, a $70-million, 39-acre business park in the City of Industry 
held its official opening recently, with 40% of its 660,000 square feet of 
industrial, office and retail space pre-leased. The project is a joint venture 
between Trammell Crow Co. and Copley Real Estate Advisors. The developers have 
also sold a contiguous 4.9-acre parcel to Kaiser Permanente, which will soon 
begin construction on a medical office building. 
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old Seventh Street Market has a new look as part of massive 
neighborhood redevelopment project under way by Lowe Enterprises Inc. in what's 
known as Center City East. The company bought the 485,000-square-foot wholesale 
produce market in 1988 as part of a purchase of 112 acres from Southern Pacific 
Railroad. Lowe has spent $5 million on its face-lift of the market and is 
developing several nearby parcels for commercial use.

EDUCATION: EVEN AS HE RETIRES AFTER 28 YEARS, JOURNALISM PROFESSOR MELVIN 
MENCHER'S TOUGH CLASSROOM TACTICS STILL SHARPLY DIVIDE HIS STUDENTS AND 
COLLEAGUES.

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the first day of classes at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism 
in 1971, and a group of 150 aspiring reporters listened eagerly as one teacher 
after another welcomed them with open arms to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
They expected more of the same when the last faculty member rose to speak. He 
was barely five feet tall, wore a rumpled black turtleneck and seemed friendly 
enough. But Melvin Mencher was not about to make them feel at home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how much power all of you people will have in five years or so," 
he said in a flat, nasal voice, his steel-blue eyes sweeping the room. "It's 
also amazing to realize that 90% of you aren't worth a damn." 
</P>
<P>
There was stunned silence, and some faculty members shook their heads. All eyes 
focused on Mencher, who began stroking his black beard and seemed to be 
enjoying himself immensely. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's going to like my class," he warned. "You'll be miserable. But maybe 
you'll learn something." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, Mencher was true to his word. For 28 years, until his retirement 
this month, he ruled the roost at one of America's most prestigious graduate 
schools of journalism. Like a drill sergeant, he pummeled his students into 
submission and turned some of them into first-class reporters. He was petty, 
abrasive, cranky, chauvinistic -- and brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the "Paper Chase" of journalism -- except Mencher was tougher and 
infinitely more cutting than the fictional Prof. Charles Kingsfield of the 
Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
"This man has been a very important figure in our business because he's the 
kind of teacher you never, ever forget," said Newsweek Editor Maynard Parker, 
who studied under Mencher in 1963. "I remember him as a hard-driving, 
meticulous man who never let up on his students. He was tough. And his greatest 
contribution is that he has gotten people started in careers that really amount 
to something in this business." 
</P>
<P>
More important, Mencher was a voice of conscience in American journalism, 
demanding that his students live up to the highest standards. 
</P>
<P>
"To be anything less than excellent in your craft is immoral," he used to say. 
"Our job is to elevate the standards of this profession. We deserve better role 
models, because newspapers shouldn't be glamorous bulletin boards, and TV 
stations that just cover fires and murders are unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
But now, it's all coming to an end. After decades of bitter, unceasing battles 
with school administrators, Mencher is reluctantly stepping down, and the 
fireworks generated by his long academic career will subside. The 63-year-old 
professor says he will go bird watching in Canada, a lifelong passion, and 
ponder his next career move. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't the first time he has left a job under disagreeable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Mencher was forced out of posts at the Fresno Bee and the University 
of Kansas because of his penchant for boat-rocking journalistic crusades. He's 
used to the old heave-ho. Yet leaving Columbia was the toughest decision he's 
ever made. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been able to play it safe," Mencher said softly as he cleaned out a 
darkened office crammed with almost three decades of students' papers, memos, 
photographs, letters, books and yellowed newspaper clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"But what the hell. You're not supposed to do that in this business. I guess I 
just began to run out of gas. You can't go on forever." 
</P>
<P>
Except, perhaps, in the minds of students. The legacy of Mencher's iron hand 
lives on for hundreds of graduates, who insist that his voice and the values he 
imparted still speak to them today. 
</P>
<P>
His classes were the intellectual equivalent of boot camp -- a nine-month 
odyssey in which students were tested, prodded, humiliated and pushed to their 
limits. Months later, when it was over, graduates loved him or hated him. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy instilled in you the feeling that there was a moral purpose to what 
you did in journalism, that all of this really matters," said Jayne Garrison, a 
former student and now a reporter covering AIDS for the San Francisco Examiner. 
"That's something I've never forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
The lessons also ring out in the pages of "News Reporting and Writing," a 
textbook written by Mencher and used by instructors nationwide. It reflects his 
years of teaching and experience as a reporter in California and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the long view, Tim Wiener, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner who works 
for the Philadelphia Inquirer, said his former professor is part of an 
important journalistic tradition and more than just a colorful curmudgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a direct line running from muckrakers like Lincoln Steffens, 
through I. F. Stone and Mencher, down to us. This guy kicked my butt and made 
me feel stupid, but he eventually helped light a fire in my belly that's still 
there. He changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are more than 1,000 so-called Mencherites in newsrooms across 
America. They work at such papers as the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, 
the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Newsday, the Miami Herald and the 
Seattle Times; some are broadcast reporters, producers or anchors, while others 
are successful authors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all over the place," said Lena Sun, a Beijing correspondent for the 
Washington Post. "And a lot of it's because of this teacher. Just thinking 
about him now makes me want to go out and do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
To Mencher's critics -- and there are many -- that's laughable. He alienated 
faculty members with abrasive complaints about academic policies, and more than 
a few Columbia colleagues applaud his departure. They cite his inability to 
work with others, a tendency to whine for no reason and a supercilious attitude 
that drove many of them up the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't treat people the way he did," said one former instructor, who 
asked not to be identified. "He was hard on women -- too hard, actually -- and 
Columbia is better off with him gone. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Hunter, a former student who is now an editor with Sunset magazine in 
Los Angeles, said she spent three years recovering from Mencher's class: "He 
made me feel terrible as a human being, as a woman, and told me a number of 
times that I had no future in the field. But I've won several (journalism) 
awards out here, and I'm doing well. I must be doing something right, and 
whatever it is, it's certainly not because of him." 
</P>
<P>
Even his admirers say Mencher's methods may have been too extreme. Tom 
Goldstein, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley, favors a 
blend of nurturing and toughness. "You have to know when to let up," he said. 
The boot camp approach, he says, works for some people, but not for others. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Mencher's class was not for the faint of heart. He had little 
patience with students' notions of what was important, at least initially, and 
took an almost bizarre delight in turning their expectations upside down. 
</P>
<P>
Was a history major from Southern California interested in covering suburban 
issues? Mencher ordered him to visit the South Bronx for a story on gang 
violence and bring back a detailed story. Now. 
</P>
<P>
Was a young woman from Yale curious about the classical music scene? Mencher 
told her to visit Times Square, mingle with pimps and prostitutes, and come 
back that night with a story on the underside of city life. 
</P>
<P>
The streets were easy compared to his class exercises. In long morning drills, 
students covered mock utility rate hearings, budget deliberations and 
hypothetical crime stories. The worst part came when he collected the 
assignments, flashed them on an overhead projector and tore them apart. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time it seemed unnecessary, but Mencher was trying to prepare you for 
the real world, where it's very competitive, very tough and generally not 
compassionate," said Richard Bonin, now a producer for "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, he could be cruel. Days after Beth Nissen broke up with her fiance 
in 1976, Mencher decided to dismember one of her stories in front of the class. 
It was a harsh performance, climaxed by the comment that she was "idea-free." 
</P>
<P>
The professor then flipped a dime in the air and told Nissen to call her 
fiance, saying she might be a good wife some day but would never be a good 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Nissen, now an ABC-TV network correspondent, rushed out of the room and burst 
into tears. On the way out, she said bitterly to Mencher: "I may never be a 
journalist, but you'll always be short." 
</P>
<P>
Is she angry after all these years? "Today I see the wisdom behind the 
cruelty," Nissen said. "He was basically saying that if we could survive his 
class, we could survive anything. And he was right. He really did us all a 
favor." 
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Mencher said he was only trying to give students a dose of 
reality. Somebody had to warn them that it was a tough world out there. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, people could say it's really psychological, that (I've) got a 
Napoleonic complex. But our students became the editors, the editorial writers, 
the managing editors. We had a terrific responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure was unrelenting. Yet Mencher also had a grudgingly compassionate 
side. Insisting that his students enjoy New York culture, he handed out free 
opera tickets. When one student seemed too tightly wound, he ordered her to 
calm down and listen to piano sonatas in his office. On Thanksgiving, he 
invited his class to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't have to be the next Bob Woodward to have turkey with Mencher," said 
former student Jim Dwyer, now a columnist with New York Newsday. "It was a 
chance to forget the times when he was so hard." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Mencher's disciples can still recite his one-line maxims, which were 
published in a book, "The Sayings of Chairman Mel." They include such pearls 
as: "Keep your eye on the lead," "You can't write if you can't think" and 
"Never submit the bare, hack minimum on a story." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there was his chief admonition: Journalists have a moral obligation 
to tell the truth and expose hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the message got through. David McClintick, author of "Indecent 
Exposure" and other books, said his teacher imparted "a new level of 
excellence, a new energy, a new unwillingness to settle for second best." 
</P>
<P>
But school administrators saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to Mencher's retirement came to a head in recent years, amid 
a heated debate over the future of journalism education. Although the issue is 
unresolved, Mencher came out on the losing end at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, Mencher and other instructors believe journalism education 
should be just that -- a tough, unsparing professional preparation. Over 28 
years, he hammered away at the basics of reporting and writing. 
</P>
<P>
But other experts object to what they call "the trade school" approach. They 
believe students must be exposed to new trends in communications, and that 
teachers should be encouraged to pursue research as do their counterparts in 
other academic disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the two schools are not the opposites they seem to be. Mencher's 
courses have always included readings on the history, literature and ethical 
quandaries of journalism, and hardly any of the new-style media mavens want to 
abolish traditional training. 
</P>
<P>
However, the outspoken professor failed to reverse the tide at Columbia. New 
administrators codified the curriculum over his angry protests and were 
irritated by his unceasing complaints. Exhausted by years of such wrangling, 
Mencher opted for early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the school will miss Mencher, Dean Joan Konner chose her words 
carefully. The two have clashed bitterly since she took over in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think time marches on," Konner said. "Mel will be replaced by somebody very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Is it a loss for students? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a loss to the school to move on into the future and to have new ideas 
coming in. I don't think he (Mencher) had his head turned toward the 
possibility of a positive future. I think he'd just had it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To others, the idea that Mencher will no longer be prowling the halls at 
Columbia is inconceivable. They fear his retirement symbolizes the end of an 
era and a disturbing new trend in American journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Mencher is a character, an American original," said Fred Kempe, a former 
student who is now Berlin bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal and author 
of "Divorcing the Dictator," a book about Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. 
"It's a tragic thing that he's leaving, because a whole tradition may just 
disappear. And he's been very much a part of that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1927, Mencher was a child of the Depression who knew the value of a 
steady job. The son of a stockbroker, he was very young when his mother died. 
He attended high school in Manhattan and studied mathematics at the 
Universities of Colorado and New Mexico but decided journalism was a good bet. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, Mencher had shown a flair for writing. More important, there were 
plenty of opportunities. His first job, at the Albuquerque Tribune in 1947, 
paid $35 a week. He later hooked up with United Press in Santa Fe to cover the 
state capital. As a free-lancer for the Christian Science Monitor, he delved 
into political corruption and got his first taste of investigative reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned very early in the game to follow the buck," he said. "The highway 
department, for example, had more federal money than many other departments, 
and it was a huge cesspool. I saw how highway bids were rigged, and that people 
could die because of shoddy construction." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Mencher began ruffling feathers with stories about infant mortality rates 
on Navajo Indian Reservations. On the basis of that work, he won a 1952 Nieman 
Fellowship at Harvard. At 25, he was one of the youngest people to win the 
prestigious scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Mencher was married and wanted to move to California. He took a job at 
the Fresno Bee and earned a reputation for unorthodox, hard-nosed reporting. 
With other journalists, he investigated the links between local politicians and 
the operators of exclusive brothels. The work was satisfying, but it got him 
into hot water with city officials and his editors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they understood that kind of journalism (because) you got a 
controversy," Mencher said. "I was getting tired and my position was untenable. 
I had to walk away. For some reason, I've always left jobs under a cloud of 
anxiety and animosity." 
</P>
<P>
His next stop was the University of Kansas at Lawrence in 1958, where he became 
a journalism teacher. As the faculty adviser to student journalists, Mencher 
supervised coverage of racism in university housing and other controversial 
stories. The articles won an award from the National Conference of Christians 
and Jews, but Mencher angered campus officials and again was forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The wandering came to a halt in 1962, when Mencher accepted a post at the 
Columbia School of Journalism. He and his wife, with whom he had three 
children, settled into a comfortable life on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Soon, 
he began a radical reshaping of the school's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '60s, most journalism professors gave students canned exercises 
and they rarely left the classroom. Led by Mencher and other influential 
professors, Columbia students were suddenly exploring every nook and cranny of 
New York. They covered courts, murders, welfare demonstrations, anti-war 
protests and other breaking stories. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Mencher said, the task of preparing them has been an uphill 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Educational standards in this country are terrible today. I've had students on 
the graduate level who can't add. Who don't know a budget from a balloon. Who 
couldn't figure out a percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for them to know what it's like to look a politician in the eye 
and say, 'Tell me the truth.' It's important that they know what it's like to 
have their work torn apart by an editor. If I can't do that, I have to wonder 
if I've had any impact at all in 28 years." 
</P>
<P>
Those doubts were erased two weeks ago when former students held an emotional 
farewell party for Mencher at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Nissen retold the anecdote about him flipping the coin and added, "he was too 
cheap to even give me the dime." Kempe, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, broke up 
the crowd when he recalled that Mencher's first assignment steered him 
unwittingly into a gay cowboy bar, where a man tried to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
Some students thanked the professor for pushing them as hard as he did, and a 
few seemed to be on the verge of tears. Others made sure they had his new 
address and promised to send copies of their work. When Mencher made brief 
remarks at the end of the evening, there was long, sustained applause. 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, he began cleaning out his office and rummaging through 
thousands of files. It was an emotionally unpleasant task and seemed to affect 
him deeply. Asked if he felt badly that his students had reaped all the glory 
while he remained in the background, Mencher cracked that he "could have been a 
contender," then brushed off the question. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taught probably 1,000 students and so I have 1,000 agents out there. Not 
only did I help them, but they're in positions of power to do good, to do the 
right thing. It's vicarious, but what an ego builder." 
</P>
<P>
For a second, he was the old Mencher, firing off tough one-liners and telling 
jokes about incompetent students. Then he slumped a little in his chair, 
looking small and vulnerable. As if a mask was about to be torn away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've become colder over the years than I should be, because I know I 
was very moved by that reception in my honor," he said. "If you're a reporter, 
you learn to mask emotions, which is a terrible thing, very hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people the other night were telling me that I did something good. And 
who wants to be told that? I could hardly hold back crying. It was awful. 
Imagine, a man crying in public."

GROWING INTO A NEW PART; 
</P>
<P>
AGING: ACTOR JACK LEMMON IS HONORED FOR GOING BEYOND THE STEREOTYPES TO PORTRAY 
AN ELDERLY MAN. HE SAYS THE ROLE TAUGHT HIM LESSONS ABOUT GROWING OLDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Lemmon was overjoyed about becoming old before his time for a role. With 
thinning, white hair, a shuffling walk, raspy voice and diminishing health, he 
faced illness and death. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old veteran actor aged a couple of decades in a matter of hours for 
his role in the 1989 film "Dad," playing Jake Tremont, an old man dealing with 
the realities of the sometimes not-so-golden years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides nods from film critics, the role has earned Lemmon the Rose Media 
Achievement Award from the Reseda-based Jewish Homes for the Aging, a nonprofit 
organization that cares for elderly Jews in the Los Angeles area on two 
campuses in the San Fernando Valley. (The award is named for Rose Solomon, 
actress Marlee Matlin's late grandmother, who was a resident of one of the 
Jewish Homes for the Aging.) 
</P>
<P>
Lemmon will receive the award at a dinner-dance Tuesday at the Four Seasons and 
as the ceremony neared, he reflected on growing older and what he learned about 
aging from the role. 
</P>
<P>
While "Dad" wasn't a glamorous role it was what Lemmon calls a "rich" one. He 
credits the film's makeup artists for giving him the physical characteristics 
of an balding, wrinkled, liver-spotted man. But the rest was up to Lemmon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a trap in playing an older person, that you just say, 'Oh, 
I'll play old,' " he says while sitting in his office across from the William 
Morris Agency. "You don't play old. Old is a state of being. In many ways he 
was very young. The biggest problem I had was in movement. I have a lot of 
nervous energy, and I'm using my hands and my face when I don't know it. So I 
tried to put him in a straitjacket in a way and confine his movements, and also 
make him slow. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no stereotype of an old person. I wish I had one -- it makes it 
easier. You can tell the way someone walks that they're old, but there's a 
hundred different ways old people can walk. When I was a kid starting out in 
New York and the subways were only a nickel, you'd get in them and ride for 
hours to kill time. I remember studying old people then. One thing I noticed 
that really struck me was the eyes, and whether or not they were dead. You can 
tell very often if someone has lost the capacity for excitement, caring, 
whatever. They're existing." 
</P>
<P>
The makeup, he adds, "did help enormously. My voice started to change; it got 
lower, a little huskier, thinner. And when I had the makeup on, nobody knew who 
I was. They couldn't believe it was me. . . . And people would treat me with 
deference. There would be less of a tendency for people to slap me on the back 
and say, 'How are you, you old son-of-a-gun?' They would be a little gentler. 
Even guys on the crew, who saw me practically only in makeup, would set out 
chairs for me. That had never happened before." 
</P>
<P>
Lemmon's portrayal of Jake Tremont was accurate enough for Sheldon Blumenthal, 
CEO of Jewish Homes for the Aging, and his staff, to choose Lemmon for the 
media award. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the film was absolutely incredible," says Blumenthal. "My first 
reaction was that I felt like I was at work. I saw it once, then again with my 
staff, and had we talked about it, about what we learned from the movie, how 
could we use this to react with the spouses and children of our residents. It 
was a very real portrayal of the problems a family has with an aging parent." 
</P>
<P>
He cites Lemmon's role as one that "didn't make old people good or bad; it just 
made them real." 
</P>
<P>
"Jack touched a nerve in people, and it was just amazing to see the hook he put 
into the audiences," says Gary David Goldberg, "Dad" director and screenwriter. 
"We tried desperately to stay away from (the stereotype of an older person). We 
wanted to show the other side. . . . More and more people are facing this kind 
of situation in their own lives, and it was imperative that we treated this in 
an important way. People would watch the film and say, 'That's my father,' or, 
'That's my mother,' which was kind of the overwhelming reaction." 
</P>
<P>
While Lemmon plays the waiting game, hoping another good role will come his 
way, he takes theedge off by golfing, traveling and spending time with his 
family. Still, he has no plans to officially retire and seems to find it hard 
to sit still in his overstuffed chair. 
</P>
<P>
His father, a baker, took early retirement at 60. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very, very proud thing for him to do," says Lemmon, who obviously 
still revered the father he lost to cancer many years ago. "The only thing is, 
he went totally bananas. The poor man would be walking around Santa Monica, 
going into shops and saying to the proprietor, 'Why is your window like this? 
Do you think this is going to make people pay attention to your product? Look 
what you've done. Where's your bread? How do I know how fresh it is?' He 
must've done it 50 times while I was with him." Lemmon laughs at the memory. 
"He did a lot of traveling, but he never should have retired." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the son learned from the father. Lemmon doesn't deny it. "I think it 
had an effect on me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I might take it easy a little more," he says after thinking about it for a 
minute. "There is the itchiness and the waiting, but it's nothing compared to 
what it was like when I was younger. I went bananas. Now I can enjoy (the time) 
more. And I realize there have to be the waits, otherwise you're just doing 
something for the sake of working, and it's probably not going to be too good." 
</P>
<P>
Besides dealing with his father's death, Lemmon and his wife Felicia gave 
shelter over a decade ago to her mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. 
She spent a couple of years with them before she moved into her own apartment 
with a full-time nurse before she died. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that time brings back some painful memories for Lemmon, who lowers 
his voice and stares off while he talks. 
</P>
<P>
"She stayed with us, then we couldn't have her in the house because we couldn't 
take care of her. We were trying to do it 24 hours a day and trying to sleep, 
but it was impossible. It gets tough. It really gets tough." 
</P>
<P>
It's brought him face-to-face with his own mortality, he admits, but adds 
quickly, "Thank God I'm in good health. My heart seems very strong, but unless 
something hits me suddenly, I think I can look forward to a pretty long life. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that bothers me is that time goes by and I want to work and I 
feel like I'm 40. Other than that, I think I'm very lucky. I think to be in 
good physical shape and having the mental attitude that I have at this age, I'm 
blessed. I have to realize that when I start getting edgy. Still a lot of me 
feels like I did when I first came out here in my 20s and said, 'Where is the 
next part? It's been a week! I'm wasting time.' I'll never get over that. I'll 
always feel that, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
Lemmon admits that roles and scripts like "Dad" aren't delivered on his 
doorstep every day. At the age of 65, is he happy with the roles he is offered? 
</P>
<P>
"Not totally. It's a dichotomy -- I don't know an actor who's had more terrific 
parts than I've had," he says. "Whether I've played them well or not, that's 
somebody's judgment. And as you get older, there are rich, wonderful parts," he 
says. "But 'King Lear' -- and 'Dad' -- don't come down the street every day. 
They are fewer. As a result, an awful lot of pretty damn good parts do not 
attract me." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran of such films as "Some Like It Hot," "The Apartment," "Days of Wine 
and Roses," "Save the Tiger" and "Missing" has to fight chronic restlessness 
and an overabundance of nervous energy while waiting for the right film. As a 
result, in recent years he's started to develop his own scripts. And despite 
the fact he remains a box-office draw, Lemmon is at the mercy of a medium that 
prefers youthful, wrinkle-free actors in leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a prejudice against older actors," says Lemmon. "But I 
think the desirability is always going to be for younger leading men who are 
going to have more of a box-office attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the elderly "is something (screenwriters) should bear in mind 
that's going to become more and more important in the lives of people they are 
trying to touch, because we are becoming more and more involved with our 
parents," he says. "There are more of us who are living longer, and they're 
going to have to face that problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it should be overdone as an issue," he adds, "like we're sending 
a message -- Hey, we have to take care of it. I think that in just doing it 
honestly it will take care of itself, if the entire family is considered and 
more thought given to the importance of older people in our lives now. Anything 
that is less gratuitous and more honest is good -- that's all I know."

FRENCH SOCIALIST TO LEAD CAPITALIST CHARGE INTO EASTERN EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: JACQUES ATTALI WAS THE ARCHITECT OF FRANCE'S FAILED PROGRAM OF 
NATIONALIZING INDUSTRY. NOW HE'S THE HEAD OF A PRO-PRIVATIZATION BANK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years ago, Jacques Attali, in his powerful role as special counselor to 
President Francois Mitterrand, directed the Socialist government's disastrous 
program of nationalizing industry and banking in France. 
</P>
<P>
The program soon backfired and contributed to the Socialist defeat in the 1986 
parliamentary elections, after which most of the policies were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Now more influential than ever at the Elysees Palace -- where he is nicknamed 
"Sherpa to God" -- Attali last week took over as president of the new European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, created to revitalize and privatize 
the economies of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
To U.S. officials who served during the controversial early years of 
Mitterrand's first term, when the Socialists ruled alongside Communists and 
instituted many leftist economic reforms, the conversion from Attali the 
militant socialist to Attali the free marketeer could hardly be more amazing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in France one day in 1982," former U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary 
Marc Leland recalled in an interview. "Jacques Attali called me to the Elysees, 
saying, 'I want to explain what we did this morning.' That was the day they 
nationalized the banks of France." 
</P>
<P>
Leland, who directed international economic policy in the Reagan Adminstration, 
added: "I find it no little irony that the man who nationalized the banks in 
France in 1982 is now the man in charge of showing Eastern Europe how to 
deregulate and privatize." 
</P>
<P>
However, French political observers, accustomed to Attali's impressive 
intellectual powers -- he is the author of 15 books -- and political 
acrobatics, are not as shocked by the transition. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Attali sees himself as a man of ideas," Figaro editor Franz-Olivier 
Giesbert wrote in a best-selling book severely critical of Mitterrand and his 
staff, "but they are rarely his own. He claims everything as his own, without . 
. . scruples." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Attali, 46, a blade of a man with dark, arching eyebrows and 
long, swept-back black hair, denies any political-economic metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still the same person," he declared last week at a news conference in 
Paris. "It is just that the conditions in Eastern Europe require massive 
privatization." 
</P>
<P>
But in typical Attali fashion, he went on to explain that the London-based 
bank, which has assets of $12 billion, would have serious political as well as 
financial dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first financial institution to impose conditions of democracy 
and human rights on its clients," he said, adding that he plans to run a tight 
ship, assembling a small core staff of Europe's "best and brightest" to scout 
investment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone worried that he might steer the bank away from its free-market course, 
Attali added, can take solace in a statute in the institution's charter 
requiring that at least 60% of its loans go to the private sector. The other 
40% will be used for projects to clean up the environment, rebuild the region's 
infrastructure and restructure state-run companies. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating that he considers himself solidly among the "best and brightest," 
Attali said in an interview after the news conference that he intends to keep 
his job as senior adviser to Mitterrand -- at least in the months it will take 
until the bank's 40 member-countries, including the United States and the 
Soviet Union, ratify the charter and a permanent home is found for the 
institution in London. 
</P>
<P>
When asked who might replace him as Mitterrand's chief confidant, Attali 
quipped, "In life, one always likes to think of himself as irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
In light of such comments, some have dismissed Attali, as one senior former 
U.S. diplomat did recently, as a "typical arrogant French intellectual." But 
few people seem to begrudge him his new job, which is described by some as 
representing a Marshall Plan for the other half of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the bank itself was mainly Attali's inspiration. After 
Mitterrand presented the idea to near-unanimous acclaim at the European 
Community summit in Strasbourg last December, he credited his aide with the 
original concept. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, Mitterrand has described Attali as a brilliant idea man. 
"If only one idea in 10 were a good one," Mitterrand reportedly said, "the 
relationship would still be worthwhile." But from the looks of things, Attali's 
batting average is higher than that. 
</P>
<P>
Among contemporary historians, there is a debate over whether Attali met 
Mitterrand at a nightclub or a restaurant. But from that moment in 1974, Attali 
has served as the French president's intellectual spark plug. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Attali so jealously guards his relationship with Mitterrand that he 
once refused to tell French Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy about a Mitterrand 
plan to visit Beirut. He is a regular companion for the president on his daily 
strolls through the streets of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In his years at the Elysees, Attali has supervised major French initiatives 
ranging from a massive dam project in Bangladesh to a quirky bicentennial 
parade last summer celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his powerful influence, Attali is more Day-Glo orange than eminence 
grise in the French government. 
</P>
<P>
Which other senior official and bank president, for example, would invite a 
clown in pea-green underwear as the honored guest at his own wedding? Attali 
did. And when his clown friend later died, Attali delivered a stirring eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
"Adieu, my pet," he concluded, calling the clown his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
How many other international luminaries consider their political role 
subordinate to their craft as a writer? Attali does. A recent book of essays, 
"Skylines," spent 14 weeks on the French best-seller list. Attali rises each 
morning at 4 to work on his essays and novels. Two of his recent projects 
include a children's book and a series of television profiles of great men in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Attali is the stereotypical model of a French intellectual 
engaged at the same time in the world of politics and art. Few have ever 
succeeded as well or as broadly. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of his friends feel he may be stretched too thin. Some critics have 
panned his writing as having more volume than value. Political associates 
complain that he regularly cancels meetings or schedules several at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Commented one friend of 20 years: "The main problem with Jacques is that there 
is a little too much Walter Mitty in him. He wants to prove himself as the 
proper civil servant, as an international banker and as a talented writer all 
at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Art Pine contributed to this story.

JIM MURRAY: DODGER VOICE FOUND MORE STYLISH ROLES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Luck," the late, great Branch Rickey used to say, "is the residue of design." 
</P>
<P>
No one was ever quite sure what he -- or it -- meant. But a career, it is well 
known, is a residue of luck. And success occurs only when -- and if -- talent 
meets opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The world of sports is a seductress on a grand scale. No one has yet figured 
out what would have happened had Ronald Reagan elected to stay in the broadcast 
booth, doing Chicago Cubs' games. 
</P>
<P>
Would he today be Harry Caray? Would the Cold War still be on? What if he had 
never come West with the team to Catalina and had never fallen under the eye of 
Hollywood? Would he have been able to keep going till he was not only Warner 
Bros.' leading man but America's leading man? 
</P>
<P>
What of the ones who did not escape? What if Howard Cosell had not become 
involved as counsel for Little League and became the host for Knothole Gang 
broadcasts? Would he have become a renowned labor lawyer or a gadfly in 
Congress? 
</P>
<P>
And what if the Dodgers hadn't been so lousy in the late '30s and early '40s? 
Would America have been deprived of one of its most celebrated and beloved 
actors? 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances are interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Larry MacPhail had taken over the team in those days and brought in Branch 
Rickey to move it up. It was a rollicking collection of misfits and mess-ups 
known fondly in the press as "the Flatbush Follies" or "the Daffy Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
They ran the bases with the careless elan of stampeding cattle, and once when a 
team promoter recommended a contest to send someone from Brooklyn to a secluded 
romantic place no one had ever been before, Casey Stengel suggested third base. 
</P>
<P>
It was the famous time when the New York Giants' Manager, Bill Terry -- to his 
ultimate regret -- cracked, "Is Brooklyn still in the league?" 
</P>
<P>
It was -- but barely. The pitching staff had a Max Butcher. The infield and 
outfield had their own butchers. The team had a permanent lock on the second 
division. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Buddy Hassett could sing like a thrush. Unfortunately, he hit 
like one, too. He had so little power a Brooklyn Eagle sportswriter wrote, 
"They kept Hassett around to sing 'When Irish Eyes Are Smiling' at the team 
banquets -- and to pop out with the bases loaded at the team rallies." 
</P>
<P>
Into this rollicking setup in 1938 came a young sophomore from the University 
of North Carolina. Even then he had this caressing, mellifluous voice, dark 
wavy hair and drop-dead good looks that would make him a show business staple 
for half a century. 
</P>
<P>
But he got the job as public address announcer for the Dodgers not entirely 
because of his dulcet baritone and Shakespearean diction -- and family 
friendship with the MacPhails -- but mostly because the resident radio 
broadcaster, Red Barber, refused to participate in some of the bizarre 
promotions of the day. 
</P>
<P>
One of them had Jesse Owens racing against a horse around the bases. Others had 
Babe Didrikson hitting golf balls out of Ebbets Field with nine-irons. 
</P>
<P>
None of this bothered the young collegian. For him, it was heady stuff. A 
dedicated baseball fan -- he can still name you the lineup, batting averages 
and mothers' maiden names of the entire 1931 Philadelphia Athletics -- it was 
rubbing elbows with the gods. 
</P>
<P>
He got $10 a day and got to sit in a dugout with the greatest cast of 
characters of the day. One of them was Babe Ruth, hired that year as part of 
the promotional effort to hype the box office, and the youngster out of college 
remembers his first great disillusionment with the grand old game. 
</P>
<P>
"Babe would sit on the bench and smoke a cigar and belch and tell stories about 
how he would drink a quart of booze and eat 10 or 12 hot dogs and still go out 
and bat .390. I didn't think ballplayers even smoked or went out with girls. He 
destroyed all my illusions." 
</P>
<P>
While he had no qualms about announcing the MacPhail capers on field, the 
take-home pay proved a little harder to put up with. He began to shop around 
for other jobs and found himself cast in radio soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
He still thought his future would be in baseball and he hankered to get into 
the broadcast booth. But the Dodgers were too well fixed there with the 
incomparable Red Barber, the competent Connie Desmond and the soon-to-appear 
Vin Scully. 
</P>
<P>
So John Forsythe became an actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I had about as much chance of cracking that lineup as the team's," he says. 
</P>
<P>
None of this pleased his father, a Wall Street broker. He equated both 
professions with selling hot watches on street corners or telling fortunes for 
a living. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not an actor," he told his son. "You don't even look like an actor." 
</P>
<P>
"How do actors look?" his son asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they all wear their hats tipped on the side of their heads and their 
overcoats tossed over their shoulders, and they have this deep resonant voice 
and smoke cigarettes with long holders." 
</P>
<P>
John Forsythe never managed to pass for a Barrymore, but he became one of 
America's, indeed the world's, most familiar leading men. He once did a 
television series, "Charlie's Angels," in which only his voice appeared -- and 
everyone knew whose it was. 
</P>
<P>
He became the embodiment of suavity and gentility. Witty, urbane, good-humored, 
civilized, gallant. Someone once said, if San Francisco were a man, it'd be 
John Forsythe. 
</P>
<P>
He's one of television's and filmdom's 10 most recognizable personalities. His 
image is positive. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always told me, if you wanted to be taken for a gentleman, first you 
you had to look like a gentleman. I remember going to Actor's Studio. Brando 
and Montgomery Clift and all those were in torn T-shirts and I had my 
button-down collars. They called me the Brooks Brothers Bohemian." 
</P>
<P>
No one would ever take John Forsythe for anything but a gentleman. Does his 
Ebbets Field past ever come up? How did that ever fit him to play Blake 
Carrington? 
</P>
<P>
"It was valuable experience," he says. "You learn to handle yourself in front 
of crowds, you learn to project, you learn to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if he had stuck with the club, he could be second man in the booth 
today. He could be Ross Porter.

'WILD THINGS' IN OPERALAND;

<P>
MAURICE SENDAK MOVES FROM CHILDREN'S BOOKS TO STAGE DESIGNER AND LIBRETTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
RIDGEFIELD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Directions to Maurice Sendak's house here are a little intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
Over the phone, Sendak describes at great length country dirt roads with no 
identification, hard-to-see turns and easy-to-miss landmarks. On a rainy, foggy 
May day, the 90-minute drive from Manhattan puts one in mind of those 
mysterious journeys to a weird land Sendak's characters regularly take, 
especially Max's voyage in Sendak's popular children's book, "Where the Wild 
Things Are." 
</P>
<P>
What wild thing lies at voyage's end? Sendak has, well . . . let's say a 
reputation. At 61 one of the world's most celebrated and successful creators of 
children's books, he is known as something of a curmudgeon. Sendak lives alone 
in a big house in the middle of the Connecticut backwoods. He is said to be 
obsessed with death, with the soul's darker side, with psychiatry. His health 
has never been robust. He was a frail child; he had a massive heart attack when 
he was 39 and now he is only recently home from the hospital and walking with a 
cane. Some of his friends have nicknamed him Morose Sendak. 
</P>
<P>
Sendak turns out, however, to be friendly, very funny, highly articulate and 
ornery. He is fretful one minute, incautiously opinionated the next. He lives 
with a huge, protective German shepherd named Runge (after the 18th-Century 
German painter) in a house dominated by childhood fantasy and adult Angst. His 
heroes are Melville, Mickey Mouse and Mozart -- and all are in great evidence. 
</P>
<P>
On the shelves of his studio, grand tomes of 19th-Century German literature and 
art knock against miniature old Disney volumes; Kleist and Robin Hood are 
neighbors. Statuettes of Mickey Mouse, Felix the Cat and Mozart crown his desk. 
A rocking chair is filled with "Wild Things" dolls. But old Mickey knickknacks 
predominate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is heresy, I know, but I always think that what Lourdes is to Bernadette, 
my house is to Mickey," Sendak says of his extensive collection of Mickey 
Mouse-iana. 
</P>
<P>
But this house filled with fantastical lore seems a perfectly natural setting 
in which to talk opera, the art that has largely taken over the last 10 years 
of Sendak's life. Angeleno operagoers may remember the New York City Opera 
production of Janacek's "Cunning Little Vixen" at the Music Center that Sendak 
designed, and now Music Center Opera has taken a fancy to him. This week, the 
company offers the double bill of composer Oliver Knussen's "Where the Wild 
Things Are" and "Higglety Pigglety Pop!," operas for which Sendak wrote the 
librettos and designed the productions based upon his books. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Sendak will return to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to design a 
new production of Mozart's "Idomeneo," and he will be employed for the 
inevitable "Hansel and Gretel" the following season. For all of these 
productions, Frank Corsaro directs. Sendak and Corsaro have also together 
mounted "The Magic Flute," a Ravel double bill of "L'Enfant et les Sortileges" 
and "L'Heure Espagnole," and Prokofiev's "The Love for Three Oranges." 
</P>
<P>
So popular has Sendak's contribution been to these fanciful productions that 
they tend to be referred to, and sometimes even advertised as, "Sendak's 
'Flute"' or "Sendak's 'Wild Thing,' " as if he were composer and director. But 
it is easy to see why. Sendak has created a visual environment that, while 
being unmistakably his own, actually serves the music. It creates a habitat of 
fantasy that entices the mind to accept the non-rational world of music, and it 
helps music create a theatrical statement. 
</P>
<P>
This is a touchy issue. Opera designers today have a habit of running away with 
a show when they can. That might lead to an entire rethinking of the art form, 
as when visionary visual artists such as Robert Wilson or Achim Freyer of 
Germany turn to opera; but it has also been responsible for the brazen 
spectacle of Franco Zeffirelli productions that dwarf singers but attract 
sell-out crowds to the Metropolitan Opera no matter who appears in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
The ardent audience attracted solely by Sendak's stage design, however, 
troubles the artist. "It is both flattering and nervous making," he admits. 
"It's not entirely different from people buying my books because they want to 
buy my pictures. That is upsetting to me, because I really take book making 
very seriously. Language comes first, and pictures are there to support and 
illumine. 
</P>
<P>
"Why bother doing a book if you don't love words?" 
</P>
<P>
With opera, Sendak says he still holds to the old-fashioned notion that words 
and music come first, but that all elements must be in proper relationship to 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is anything wonderful about an opera, it is the maddening, unusual 
fusion of all these elements. But how do you do it? You have music; you have 
set design; you have lighting; you have a director; you have singers; you have 
a conductor, and you have an orchestra. Man, you get that all together and you 
have performed a miracle. Occasionally it happens and it knocks you off your 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I sound like an old fogy, and I am an old fogy, but I don't like it 
when the sets take over, or when a prima donna takes over, or a tenor takes 
over, or the conductor takes over." 
</P>

In fact, Sendak's operatic sensitivity comes first of all from his longtime 
love of opera as words and music. He has had a passion for opera since boyhood, 
and he can pinpoint exactly how it all began: during a radio broadcast of 
"Fidelio," conducted by Toscanini, on a Sunday afternoon in the early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the second act, and it was Jan Peerce singing Florestan's aria, where 
he sees the angel, he sees Leonore," Sendak recalls. "And I flipped out. I 
couldn't believe my ears. That was it; I remember that precise moment of 
hearing that aria." 
</P>
<P>
Until 11 years ago, opera was just that, a personal passion. But at about the 
same time -- and out of the blue -- Sendak got calls from Corsaro and from 
Theatre de la Monnaie, the opera company of Brussels. Corsaro, long a fan of 
"Wild Things," thought Sendak would be perfect for a production of "Magic 
Flute" that he was about to direct. Monnaie wanted to commission an opera of 
"Wild Things" as part of the celebration of the Year of the Child. 
</P>
<P>
"Where the Wild Things Are," the book that Sendak wrote and illustrated in 
1961, has been phenomenally popular with children and controversial with 
adults. The popularity and controversy come from the psychological acuity of a 
story about a misbehaving young boy, Max, whose mother punishes him by sending 
him to bed without his supper. From his bedroom, Max sets off on a dream voyage 
to the land of the wild things, remarkable giant creatures both fearsome and 
friendly, familiar and strange at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
These wild things translate into irresistible 10-foot creatures on stage. But 
who or what are they, and why do they so fascinate? 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for the wild things came, Sendak delightedly acknowledges, from 
his relatives in Brooklyn, and how ghastly he found them as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
"They had huge yellowed eyes and stained mouths and hairs falling out of 
nostrils and boils and pimples and things that disgusted us as children," he 
says. "So when the relatives came over, and these lumbering fat faces loomed 
over us, pinched us, mauled us, kissed us and said, 'We could eat you up we 
love you so,' we thought, 'Hey, if Mama doesn't cook dinner fast, they'll eat 
anything.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the wild things are: revenge on the relatives." 
</P>
<P>
Turning the children's book into an opera was anything but a natural prospect. 
"It's a book of just barely 385 words, which would make about a 
minute-and-a-quarter opera," Sendak explains. 
</P>
<P>
"And the point of the book was its obliqueness. That's the whole point of a 
picture book -- you write obliquely and then you fill in with pictures and you 
tell as little as possible. You let the pictures tell more, but you let readers 
make it all up, the subtext. 
</P>
<P>
"But opera is so literal. You have to tell everything in order to fill time, 
and the worry was that having to tell too much would wreck the book. What does 
Max know at 5? Is he going to sing 'I am 5, but I know Freud said that at my 
age I should be hating my mother and have Oedipal feelings towards my father, 
but I'm controlling that as best I can'? So how do you give him an aria where 
he is as innocent and primitive as he is in the book but yet has something to 
sing? It is very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
But Oliver Knussen proved the kind of collaborator Sendak needed, a composer 
able to get into a child's mind without writing childish music. And what Sendak 
and Knussen created became an opera that may be popular with children but is 
not "children's opera." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what children's operas are," Sendak says. "Ollie's music is not 
children's music, God forbid. But whatever is in me, and whatever is in him, 
that appeals to children -- and we can't even figure out what that is -- works, 
it miraculously works. 
</P>
<P>
"That is as close as we get to doing an opera for children. We have some kind 
of affinity. But he doesn't compromise at all, he writes very dense and 
complicated music. And I write books that very often scandalize librarians and 
parents who think the subjects very inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
"You know there is such a thing as children's opera, and they're hideous 
because they're condescending, because everyone sort of drops half their brain 
out of their left ear and thinks this is going to be easy, it's only for kids. 
It's despicable to treat children that way. It's all right to treat adults that 
way, we do it all the time, 90% of the books published treat them like that, so 
they're used to it. But we shouldn't do it to kids." 
</P>
<P>
What, then, makes an opera suitable for kids? "When it's very good, it's 
probably suitable for children. When it's very bad, it's probably only suitable 
for opera lovers," Sendak says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Wild Thing," and its successor, "Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must 
Be More to Life," about an adorable dog who takes to the stage, have proven 
popular with children because the works never condescend to them. Instead, 
Knussen and Sendak have created operas written from the point of view of adults 
reliving childhood reverie. Knussen's scores are sophisticated modern music, 
not simplistic tuneful "children's music," but the music is also stage music, 
able to describe action and thought and make a rumpus. 
</P>
<P>
"The only ones who are going to love you being straight and honest with them 
and telling them like it is are kids," Sendak claims, "because they are the 
most reasonable creatures on Earth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm hopelessly generalizing. But there is a point to this. Children 
are so catholic in their tastes, so open. It doesn't mean they love what you 
do. Sometimes they hate what you do. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a passionate response. It has nothing to do with prejudice of any 
kind. They're wide open, open to anything." 
</P>
<P>
And it is for that unprejudiced audience that Sendak would now like to create 
his own children's theater. "We would do some classics, but primarily I would 
like it to be where I could commission young artists to write plays, write 
operas, ballets for children in the sense that all my work as been for 
children. I hope this will happen, because I want one last terrific career. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the stage. There are maybe six or seven books of mine where the kids go 
on stage. I feel that affinity. That pull was there long before I was even 
conscious of it, that I wanted to get there, that I wanted to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"So this is the career I want to begin now, and I hope it happens. It will," 
says an enthused Sendak, standing up, forgetting his cane, "give me a new lease 
on life."
