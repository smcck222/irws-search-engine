<P>
Alan Parker's Fame (Channel 5 Sunday at 6 p.m.) begins with a terrific 10 
minutes: the routine at New York's High School of the Performing Arts, squeezed 
into a blazing music video. Then it collapses under a script full of vacuous 
teen revelry, fame mongering and I-wanna-be-a-star drivel. Every once in a 
while, another song comes along and picks it back up again, making this one 
movie that should face the music, dance and kick out the rest. That's Irene 
Cara on the title number -- as if you didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Sunday: Mark Rydell's Cinderella Liberty (Channel 9 at 11 p.m.) 
springs from a soapy Darryl Ponicsan novel about a guilt-haunted sailor's 
romance with a prostitute (Marsha Mason) and her mulatto son. Ponicsan isn't as 
good at adapting himself as Robert Towne was, on "The Last Detail." But, as the 
sailor, James Caan gives a wonderful performance: energetic, sincere and pure 
as rainfall. Little Girl Lost (ABC at 9 p.m.), a made-for-TV movie with Tess 
Harper, raises issues of child molestation, foster homes and custody battles. 
</P>
<P>
Monday shows both Alan Alda and John Carpenter at less than their best. Alda is 
a college professor coping with history and Hollywood on a movie location in 
Sweet Liberty (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.). Carpenter burrows through the bowels of 
San Francisco's Chinatown, encrusted with Fu Manchu decor, choppy-socky cliches 
and a John Wayne impersonation by Kurt Russell that he'd probably rather 
forget, in Big Trouble in Little China (Channel 11 at 8 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is an ingratiatingly 
cynical sports comedy about a minor-league hockey coach (Paul Newman, in a 
performance that oozes puckish charm), setting a fast pace in the boudoir, 
while hoking up his team with calculated violence. (Nancy Dowd wrote the mean, 
funny lines.) 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday: Hell and High Water (Channel 11 at 8 p.m.), a Sam Fuller war 
movie (not his best, either) set aboard a submarine in the Arctic, with Richard 
Widmark and Bella Darvi. And there's the ill-fated Brainstorm (Channel 5 at 8 
p.m.), Natalie Wood's last movie, with Douglas Trumbull's revolutionary visual 
effects probably barely perceptible on the TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
John Ford's "Seven Women" is discussed, and recommended, elsewhere today. 
Another great Irish Catholic American film maker, Leo McCarey, also set his 
last movie in China: the 1962 Satan Never Sleeps (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 
p.m.), loosely based on Pearl Buck's "A China Story." But, unlike Ford, McCarey 
didn't extract any timeless moral drama from the tale. Caught up in another of 
his late-career anti-Commie diatribes, McCarey has William Holden and Clifton 
Webb as, essentially, Father O'Malley and Fitzgibbon battling the Reds, with a 
lot of Civil War, rapine, pillage and celibacy jokes to spice up the stew. It's 
a bitter valedictory. 
</P>
<P>
And if you want to see how far romantic comedy has sunk since the heyday of 
McCarey, Lubitsch, Hawks and Cukor -- Woody Allen honorably excepted -- take a 
look at ex-Allen cohort Marshall Brickman's Lovesick (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 
p.m.), with Dudley Moore as a Manhattan psychiatrist and Elizabeth McGovern as 
a kind of yuplet. Better yet, don't. 
</P>
<P>
To Hell and Back (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a real curiosity: a film 
bio, from his book, of the exploits of the most decorated World War II soldier, 
Audie Murphy -- with then-movie star Murphy playing himself. Beyond the 
casting, Jesse Hibbs' movie is stuck in Purgatory. (Interestingly, World War 
II's fourth most decorated soldier also became a movie actor, and a fine one -- 
though ex-G.I. Neville Brand rarely played anything but heavies.) 
</P>
<P>
Notes from the pre-glasnost era. Back in 1960, a look at the filming of Can-Can 
(Channel 9 Saturday at 10 p.m.) which starred Frank Sinatra, Maurice Chevalier 
and the eternally sexy Shirley MacLaine, prompted an outraged Nikita Khrushchev 
to remark: "The face of humanity is more beautiful than its backside!" -- a 
sentiment you might want to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
Also on tap on a rich Saturday: David Seltzer's funny-sad, wonderful teen movie 
Lucas (CBS at 8 p.m.), a real heartwarmer, and no kidding. And Alan Pakula's 
icily terrific modern true-crime thriller All the President's Men (Channel 13 
at 10 p.m.) with Redford and Hoffman as the Martin and Lewis of journalism -- 
or are they the Woodward and Bernstein of movies?

ESCAPE FROM HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLYS J. HARRIS , Excerpted from The Zanucks of Hollywood: The Dark Legacy 
of an American Dynasty, by Marlys J. Harris, to be published in July by Crown 
Publishers, Inc. Darryl F. Zanuck was vice president in charge of production at 
20th Century-Fox from 1935 to 1952. He died in 1979. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Regulars of what came to be called the Palm Springs Yacht Club included 
Douglas Fairbanks Jr., David Niven, Jennifer Jones and David Selznick, and 
Tyrone Power.' 
</P>
<P>
DURING THE WINTER months, Darryl, his wife, Virginia, and sometimes the 
children would travel to Palm Springs by airplane or car. In 1943, Zanuck had 
bought an estate there. Virginia christened it Ric-Su-Dar, after the first 
syllables of the names of the three children, Richard, Susan and Darrylin. The 
walled-off compound, which took up most of a block near the town's center, 
contained two structures -- a two-story main house, where the family and 
servants stayed, and a pool house with four bedrooms and a living room that 
guests came to call the "casino." Separating the two whitewashed, red-tiled 
buildings was a 70-foot pool. Tall date palms, lemon trees and tamarisks 
provided shade, and pink, white, red and yellow flowers bloomed out of beds 
that lined the manicured lawn. The Zanucks added a tennis court behind the pool 
house. 
</P>
<P>
When Zanuck himself first visited the house to survey the work that was needed, 
he found an old croquet set. He began to play and, once he became accomplished, 
took up the sport with a vengeance. Every weekend celebrities would stream to 
Ric-Su-Dar to relax or play croquet. The two activities were mutually 
exclusive, since Zanuck took the sport so seriously. For matches that ran deep 
into the night, the players parked cars around the perimeter of the field and 
trained headlights on the croquet course. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cotten was a frequent guest. Other regulars of what came to be called 
the Palm Springs Yacht Club included Douglas Fairbanks Jr., David Niven and his 
wife, Hjordis, Jennifer Jones and David Selznick, Spyros Skouras and Tyrone 
Power. The chief activity, of course, was croquet, and the lawn was dotted with 
sturdy white wickets, a scoreboard and other equipment. "If you didn't play 
croquet," wrote Cotten in his autobiography, "you saw Darryl and the others 
only at lunch, cocktails and dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Darrylin recalled in an interview for a Palm Springs magazine years later that 
the games got so rowdy at times that neighbors summoned the police because 
"they thought somebody was being murdered. What was really happening was that 
Daddy was shouting that he had seen Clifton Webb or some other player move 
their ball, and, a couple of times, in the heat of the play, Howard Hawks threw 
his mallet down and left in a huff. They used to get very, very wild." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia was the queen of the weekend doings. She hired a chef and a pastry 
chef to feed the guests, who numbered as many as 40. She would have breakfast 
served outdoors at six or seven tables. At 11 o'clock, the croquet game would 
begin. Other visitors swam in the pool or batted balls in the tennis court. 
Virginia would call a halt to play about two hours later, when everybody would 
adjourn to the big Spanish patio, where a long table had been set up. Lunch 
would last for two hours. "By that time," said Darrylin, "Daddy was raring to 
go again with the croquet, and they'd go back to it." Virginia and the women 
would prowl the Palm Springs shops for clothing in the afternoon. At 7 o'clock, 
the entire party would meet in the casino for cocktails. Then they would troop 
off to the main house for dinner -- a two- or three-hour affair. 
</P>
<P>
When the game was finished before dark, according to Cotten, "there was dancing 
to the phonograph or a wild game of charades in the billiards room." Charlie 
Chaplin, ironically, "always won the booby prize," wrote Cotten. Virginia was a 
canasta fiend, and she would recruit a foursome who would retire to a corner to 
play. Noel Coward or Judy Garland would sing. And "sometimes, when the stars 
lowered themselves over the desert to within touching distance, Spyros Skouras 
would recite Greek poetry in his native tongue," Cotten wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Zanuck played practical jokes, and though Virginia supposedly disapproved she 
yowled with laughter at his antics. She didn't deplore all his jokes, she once 
declared, because he could take it as well as he dished it out. One favorite 
ploy was to hand a new guest his "personal mallet." Zanuck claimed it was so 
delicately balanced that it would turn a new player into a virtuoso magically. 
Supposedly the finest wood from the Himalayas or from Lebanon gave it the 
proper heft. After the third or fourth shot, the mallet would break into a 
million splinters. To his guest's horror, Zanuck would wail, "Oh, my God, that 
mallet is irreplaceable." Another trick was the erratic ball. It would veer 
aimlessly no matter how truly a player hit. 
</P>
<P>
Weekends at Ric-Su-Dar were always relaxing -- unlike Beverly Hills 
get-togethers where people were made to dress up in showy, uncomfortable 
clothing. At Virginia's home, guests could wear slacks and shirts or golf 
skirts and T-shirts. When the weekend was over, the Zanucks' driver would 
convey them to the airport. Back to the rat race.

WHO IS ROXANI GILLESPIE?; 
</P>
<P>
AND WHY IS SHE SAYING ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT RALPH NADER, THE 
INSURANCE REVOLT AND PROP. 103?

IN HER AIRY OFFICE, high above San Francisco, California Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie, petite and perky in her round, bouncy, black Dutch-boy bob 
with bangs, is hopping about the floor, flapping her arms and swishing her 
skirts as she demonstrates, amid gales of merry laughter, the virtues of her 
dress. The commissioner is tired of all the flak she's been getting -- from her 
daughter, her press secretary, even perfect strangers -- about the dresses that 
have become her trademark: prim, pristine little-girl numbers, Laura Ashleys by 
label, with gathered skirts, puffy sleeves, teensy patterns. This one is blue. 
With what looks like rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
Little Miss Muffet comes to mind. An English nanny. The parson's wife. Roxani 
Gillespie, 48, looks more like any of these than the queen of California's 
$55-billion insurance industry and the state's most politically controversial 
woman since former Chief Justice Rose Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"I like these dresses!" Gillespie protests, giggling, exasperated, as her press 
secretary, a pretty, stylish blonde in a smart black suit, named Carey 
Fletcher, covers her eyes and groans at the indignity of the unfolding sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Suits are not comfortable. These dresses are comfortable," Gillespie cries, 
slapping at her unfettered waist, her hidden hips. "Look!" Jerk goes the skirt. 
Walking space. "See!" Yank, a handful of bodice. Roomy. Gillespie likes these 
dresses so much, in fact, she next announces, that she buys them by the 
half-dozen, each style in all available colors. "Let's see." She pauses, 
frowning, ticking them off briskly on her fingers. "I have this one in red, 
blue, green, black and, uh . . . yes! Dark blue! Why not? I don't like to shop. 
Besides, men wear the same clothes all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher moans. "God, you oughta see her black one," she mutters. "It's got 
little pink flowers on it." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie thinks that's hilarious, too. She flounces into her chair, triumphant 
-- having demonstrated, all within a space of five minutes, a good many of the 
qualities that have reduced her critics to howls of impotent fury for months 
now: Unpretentious, down to earth, spontaneous, funny, she's a born charmer. 
Also stubborn, opinionated, a streak explosive and possessed of enough apparent 
self-confidence for 15 people. You don't like the way she runs her kingdom? 
Ralph Nader calls her a lackey of the insurance industry? No refund check from 
your insurance company yet? You think she wants to trash Proposition 103? You 
might as well criticize her dress. 
</P>
<P>
EVER SINCE November, when California voters, in their most dramatic uprising 
since the property-tax rebellion of 1978, passed Proposition 103, consumer 
activists and assorted politicians have been protesting that Roxani Gillespie 
-- Greek immigrant, attorney, wife and mother, one-time claims adjuster and 
former insurance company executive -- is unfit to preside over such a 
pioneering piece of populist history. 
</P>
<P>
What Proposition 103 represents is something out of any good conservative's 
worst nightmare: a public lunge into the affairs of one of capitalism's most 
enduring monoliths. Among other reforms mandated by 103, insurance companies -- 
unless they can persuade Gillespie otherwise -- must roll back their rates to 
their Nov. 8, 1987, levels, then reduce them by an additional 20%. Banks have 
been granted permission to enter the insurance market. The office of the 
insurance commissioner, traditionally one of the governor's appointive plums, 
has been turned over to the electoral process, starting in 1990, and 
transformed from an essentially passive administrative post into an aggressive 
consumer watchdog position, with full authority to set all future rates for 
California's 788 insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
All of which, critics say, is utterly beyond Gillespie's demonstrated 
capacities or inclinations. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gillespie, appointed commissioner by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1986, 
has been accused of grandstanding, evading, deceiving and dragging her feet on 
103; of making decisions stacked in favor of insurance companies or, more 
often, of making no decisions at all. She has been called everything from 
criminally negligent to a docile puppet of Deukmejian. She has been likened to 
various small animals -- "an attack pit bull" (Harry Snyder, West Coast 
director of Consumers Union); a "bulldog" (Will Glennon, legal analyst for the 
California Trial Lawyers Assn.), and "a timid mouse" (Robert Fellmeth, director 
of the Center for Public Interest Law). 
</P>
<P>
"That woman isn't fit to be dogcatcher," screams Proposition 103 author Harvey 
Rosenfield. His mentor, Ralph Nader, national icon of consumer rights, also has 
pitched in, demanding Gillespie's resignation. "She has no interest in 
consumers; she's just biding her time, waiting for some big fat offer from the 
insurance industry," Nader warns from his Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
And, if pressure on Gillespie was heavy before, the California Supreme Court 
only turned up the heat in its May 4 ruling upholding most of Proposition 103. 
The court's decision vested Gillespie with even more authority than she had 
before, essentially the power (subject to court appeal) to decide, right here 
alone in this stark little office with the picture of Athena on the wall, which 
insurance companies must grant the 20% rollbacks and which get off the hook. 
The court further dramatically relaxed the standard that companies must meet to 
qualify for exemptions: Under Proposition 103's original language, only 
companies that could show a "substantial threat of insolvency" would have been 
spared from the rollback; now Gillespie need only find that they are being 
denied "a fair and reasonable" profit, as she determines it. Gillespie says the 
fair rate of return will vary from company to company and that past profits 
will not be a factor in deciding whether a rollback is merited. 
</P>
<P>
And we're not just talking auto insurance here -- an $11-billion industry all 
by itself -- but every form of property and liability insurance in California, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, they are pounding on her door in droves, insurance companies begging 
exemptions based on need. Nearly all of California's insurance companies are 
expected to file. And, now it isn't going to be just the Rosenfields and Naders 
on her case: Every policyholder in California who doesn't get a refund check in 
the mail is going to be mad at Roxani (pronounced Rox-annie) Gillespie, too. 
And that's probably going to be a whole lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
BUT DON'T BLAME Gillespie -- she always told you Proposition 103 was a lousy 
law. From the start of the insurance initiative wars last year, Gillespie has 
been quite explicit in her view of 103 as "unfair and one-sided" in its all-out 
assault on insurance companies, while doing nothing about what she sees as the 
central villains in escalating auto-insurance rates: ambulance-chasing lawyers 
and their sue-happy clients. To Gillespie, 103 was never more than a 
"pie-in-the-sky" fraud perpetrated upon consumers by Nader and Rosenfield. 
</P>
<P>
Now the chickens have come home to roost, and there's no overstating 
Gillespie's frustration as she sits at her desk, eyes flashing, intent, trying 
to explain once again, in her clipped European accent, the reasons 103 will 
never work -- and why "a lot of people are going to be frosted" when they don't 
receive a rebate or a rollback. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you have a very significant California auto industry that simply 
doesn't have the money that Rosenfield says they have," she exclaims for the 
umpteenth time since Proposition 103 exploded in her lap, "it's going to depend 
on whether your company is a rich one or not. If you're with one of the big 
guys that comes from the East that has a significant surplus, like our friend 
State Farm, you're going to get your rebate. But a great number of 
policyholders with California companies simply are not." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has always complained about the inherent unfairness of this 
situation. Why should some customers get rollbacks and not others? Thus, she 
sees the Supreme Court decision, which basically enables her to grant 
exemptions to more insurance companies, as "fairer across the board to 
consumers." Meaning, if you don't get a refund, you are now less likely to be 
jealous of your neighbor, because he's probably not going to get one either. 
Gillespie searches for a way to make the situation clear: 
</P>
<P>
"What Harvey has gotten passed is something that says, 'This VW just as it is, 
you got it for $5,000 last year, well, you're going to be getting it for $4,000 
this year.' Now, the VW is exactly the same -- so how is that going to happen? 
Harvey didn't say, 'OK, how are we going to get the VW to cost less? Let's take 
out the radio, let's take out the tape deck, let's take out the air 
conditioner.' No. It was the exact same VW, but costing less." 
</P>
<P>
Good for Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you see," she cries, exasperated, unamused, "and that's exactly what 
everybody likes! But how the heck is the VW manufacturer going to be able to 
provide you with this VW? It's very seductive. But where I'm coming from is the 
bottom line. We must find a way to bring down costs for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
To Gillespie, whose opinion is shared by many insurance experts, the only 
solution to the auto-insurance crisis is some type of no-fault plan, which 
would eliminate costly court battles between insurance companies over which 
driver was at fault. Instead, each driver would be obliged to collect damages 
from his own company, most lawsuits over auto accidents would be eliminated and 
recovery for hard-to-prove losses such as pain and suffering would be 
drastically limited. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating lawsuits and attorneys' fees is all-important to Gillespie, which 
is the central reason she so dislikes the consumerists nipping at her heels. In 
her view, they are not only half-baked ideologues and flunkies of the trial 
lawyers but a social menace, too, thanks to their obvious populist appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Most days, she simply swats them away like gnats -- all of them, from the 
large, established Consumers Union (which Gillespie once dismissed as "a 
handful of people who test vacuum cleaners") to Rosenfield's Voter Revolt, the 
organization behind 103. 
</P>
<P>
"Pussycats, all pussycats," she sighs, laughing, dismissing the whole lot of 
them with an airy hand, her tone one of near fondness, the tolerant teacher 
beset by naughty and somewhat slow-witted pupils. "And they're always so 
unprepared, they don't do their homework, they don't show much understanding at 
all of the financial situation," she clucks. "Frankly, I think they are mostly 
interested in the (TV) cameras." 
</P>
<P>
Other days, Gillespie tries to accord them some minimal respect. It isn't easy. 
"I don't like them because these people don't represent the consumers, they 
represent themselves. What the Rosenfields of the world" -- she pronounces it 
Rosenfeld, apparently in innocence -- "really want is to be the consumers' 
daddy. They're paternalistic; they want to make the consumers' decisions for 
them. And their agenda -- at least the Rosenfield agenda, and the Ralph Nader 
agenda -- is to stop tort reform. They represent only the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"And I do think that they truly believe in it. They feel .in their hearts there 
is no need to do anything about legal excesses, that these awards are never too 
big, that we simply cannot have enough of a good thing," she says. "And, of 
course the rights of victims are important -- or there would be no need to have 
insurance. But there is the other side, too. What about the poor stiffs that 
pay the bills? We must bring this to a common-sense compromise. There are 
excesses on both sides, but Harvey has persuaded people otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
By the time she finishes, she is practically wagging her finger. That's the 
most consumerists will ever get from Gillespie by way of serious consideration. 
Otherwise, her plan is clear: She intends to kill them with condescension, if 
she doesn't mock them to death first. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Nader, the man who has gone so far as to demand her job, takes the 
mightiest chop. "Why does he do these things? He has never even met me," 
Gillespie wonders. "Normally, you wait for a person to at least act, but this 
man sits out on the East Coast and uses the same libretto for everyone, be it 
General Motors or me. Actions are irrelevant to him." 
</P>
<P>
She warms. "The last time he was in California, for example, was the very day 
when we had just gotten State Farm to refund what we alleged to be improper 
premiums to its policyholders. It was on Page One of The Times!" she remembers, 
simmering. "But, there was Nader anyway, in the state Legislature, saying I was 
lackadaisical, dragging my feet, that I wasn't doing anything." Gillespie 
throws up her hands, then, mockingly, this to Nader himself: "Now, come on. 
Everybody can read, Ralph. Maybe you can't, but everyone else can. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just hope the man would eventually go back to wherever he comes from," 
she finishes, neat as a cat wiping its paws. 
</P>
<P>
SO JUST WHO is this lively, razor-tongued, uncowed woman, so seemingly fit for 
high-pressure public combat, who suddenly emerges from the obscurity of what 
was once one of California's most boring, ignored agencies to Page One 
prominence, Woman of the Hour? 
</P>
<P>
Roxani Manou Gillespie is, for starters, the daughter of a prosperous and 
influential family of Greek politicians, intellectuals and attorneys. She 
speaks six languages, including Russian, fluently. She immigrated to the United 
States when she was 22, having married a Canadian based in Boston who is now a 
consulting engineer in suburban San Carlos. She is the mother of two 
college-aged children: Costa, 20, an engineering student at the University of 
the Pacific, and Margaret, 22, a UCLA law student. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie is also an attorney. She attended Boston College Law School and, 
after graduation, worked for a couple of years as an attorney for the Boston 
Legal Aid Society. It was there, she says, that she decided she would rather be 
a corporate attorney than work with poor people. They were too frustrating, she 
recalls -- and, in some cases, frightening. She still grimly remembers one 
client she represented in a divorce case: 
</P>
<P>
"This woman had three children who all drowned -- at three different times, one 
in a bathtub, another in a pool. The police marked them all up to accidents, 
but, you just knew. . . ." Gillespie, subdued, shakes the image away. "But 
these were the kinds of people who were our clients. We had to represent them." 
</P>
<P>
Even those who weren't probable murderers exasperated her, she says. "I could 
not get them out of my mind, because what you saw in a lot of (clients) is that 
they were in a vicious circle, some of it of their own making, and it was very 
hard for them to pull out," she says. "You could say, 'Now, Mrs. Smith, I 
really never want to defend you against such a charge ever again.' But you knew 
darn well, lo and behold, she would be coming right back the next week." 
</P>
<P>
And so, "I decided then that I was not good at being a public defender, that it 
was far easier to deal with issues than with poverty," she finishes. "It is 
much easier dealing with the big guys than with the Mrs. Smiths whose children 
keep drowning." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie began small with the big guys, however. Her first job, after her 
husband transferred to San Francisco in 1970, was as a claims adjuster for 
Industrial Indemnity, the large San Francisco-based insurance firm where she 
would spend the next 13 years. "It was the only job I could find. There wasn't 
much demand for female attorneys in those days." Her rise within the company 
was rapid, however. In fact, she says, her first promotion, to corporate 
attorney in 1971, came too fast. "I was their token woman, totally unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Gillespie became a vice president, making her the 
highest-ranking woman in California insurance circles at that time. Heady years 
-- by 1980, even Gov. Jerry Brown briefly considered her for insurance 
commissioner, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Gillespie's halcyon days at Industrial Indemnity were fast coming to 
an end, she says, still visibly soured about it. "I realized I had hit that 
invisible glass ceiling, you know? When you know you're never going to advance 
any further." She was just about to quit and go into private practice or hunt 
for a judgeship, she says, when along came Deukmejian in 1983 to appoint her 
deputy insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie is also a self-described feminist, particularly when it comes to 
abortion rights, which she supports with almost white-lipped intensity. In 
fact, she says, although she is a registered Republican and a "fiscal 
conservative," she is a liberal on most civil-rights issues. She even supported 
her fellow Greek-American, Michael S. Dukakis, for President. But, she quickly 
amends, "only until he won the nomination. Then I stopped working for him." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I felt it would have been inappropriate," she says, confused at the 
question. "It would have embarrassed the governor if I were out working for 
Dukakis. He really wanted Bush -- and I'm his appointee, after all. You have to 
be a team player." She won't say whether, in the privacy of the polling booth, 
she voted for her Greek or for George Deukmejian's Texan. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean she's a puppet of Deukmejian, who dislikes Proposition 
103 every bit as much as she does. "I've never personally discussed 103 with 
the governor," she says vaguely. "And he doesn't tell me what to do on a 
day-to-day basis. But he does set the standard, definitely. By his own actions, 
he sets the tone. He took a position against 103. He opposed all the 
propositions. That sends a definite message." 
</P>
<P>
But Gillespie never stays vague for long. What about all these charges that 
she's an insurance company lackey? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the pockets of anybody," she explodes. "I don't know why they keep 
saying it. There's absolutely no evidence. What these people (consumerists) 
want is a commissioner who's in their pockets. In their own way, they are no 
different from the insurance companies -- both sides want absolutely unfettered 
authority. But I'm no part of any of it. I am trying to be a very independent 
commissioner, to do what I think is right for my customers, California 
policyholders. I also think that if I were a gray-haired gentleman, there would 
not be this much attention." 
</P>
<P>
And now she is marching through the lobby of a fancy San Francisco hotel, en 
route to a speaking engagement, such a conspicuous figure in her blue corduroy 
dress, her sturdy, no-nonsense black shoes with their big, odd Pilgrim buckles, 
a little old lady's black plastic purse over her arm, chin jutted forward, 
girlish bangs hanging almost to her eyes, the body language -- stand back. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, passing a group of men, she snatches at her visitor's arm. "Did you 
hear that?" she whispers, excited, eyes sparkling. "One of those men back there 
said, 'There goes Gillespie and her entourage.' " Gillespie notices these small 
episodes in her new life -- and, have no doubt, she's thriving in the 
limelight. It's a kick, being recognized; all the media attention fascinates 
her. She's gradually mastering the art of the 30-second TV sound bite, she 
confides. "Insurance issues are so complicated, it's difficult, but we're 
trying to learn." ("She's learning too well," Rosenfield gripes.) 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Gillespie coy about the thrill of it all. 
</P>
<P>
"There I was, in the sleepy old days -- I had my green eyeshade, I did my work, 
I did my numbers -- we were basically a nickel-and-dime collection agency. And 
then wham, all this," she says, in delighted mockery of her own former, musty 
state-agency status. Now, thanks to Proposition 103, Gillespie's budget has 
nearly doubled, to about $60 million, and her staff also has almost doubled; 
she will soon have 788 employees at her command. "We're having the time of our 
lives." Gillespie also relishes seeing her once-unglamorous $85,000-per-year 
job suddenly become the focus of so many covetous eyes. At last count, there 
were at least half a dozen prospective candidates. 
</P>
<P>
She may, of course, run herself. So far she's not saying. Only that "I haven't 
made up my mind. I'm too busy right now just getting the show on the road." 
</P>
<P>
And then she is swallowed up in a sea of beaming, pink-cheeked, flannel-suited 
insurance executives, members of the Workers Compensation Institute. By way of 
introduction, the host calls Gillespie "a capable and diligent administrator" 
who has "shown tremendous grace under fire" despite many "potshots and cheap 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's speech -- quick, clear, relaxed and off-the-cuff -- contained this 
basic message: The insurance companies had better get moving now, on their own, 
to remedy the inequities in the workers comp system, to do more for "the folks 
who pay the bills . . . not just the workers" before "what happened to your 
brethren in the automobile industry happens to you too. California, as you 
know, has the initiative process." Everybody laughed. 
</P>
<P>
GILLESPIE became insurance commissioner three years ago, after her predecessor, 
Bruce Bunner, was unceremoniously bumped by Deukmejian in a dispute over 
Bunner's attempt to take a harder line in regulating insurance companies. 
Critics called Bunner's departure a blatant display of the Administration's 
cozy relationship with the insurance industry -- and Gillespie was promptly 
portrayed as a commissioner the governor could control. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has always said that she only wants what's best for California 
policyholders -- all of them. Cheaper rates for everybody, not just some. But, 
she complains, it's not her role to make insurance law, only to implement what 
she's given. Then she explodes in a fit of real temper at the state 
Legislature. It burns Gillespie up that she's in the middle of this controversy 
all because, she fumes, the "do-nothing" Legislature failed to head off the 
insurance revolt by properly performing its duty to provide decent insurance 
laws -- an opinion that is widely shared. 
</P>
<P>
In Gillespie's opinion, the Legislature has passed only one significant 
insurance bill during her tenure -- the so-called Joint Underwriting Assn. 
bill, directing companies to provide affordable coverage to day-care centers 
and others. And, she declares, "I proposed that bill myself, or rather the 
governor did. It was one of the first things I did when I took office, and they 
dragged their feet on even that for a year." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), chairman of the Senate insurance claims 
committee, only shakes his head at Gillespie's assault on the Legislature. "Her 
department has opposed 75% of all reform legislation we've proposed in past 
years," he says. And what the insurance industry hasn't resisted, he adds, the 
trial lawyers have. 
</P>
<P>
But, as far as Gillespie is concerned, she's the only one getting any work done 
on behalf of the consumer. She cites everything from rate review to information 
hot lines. But, her real pride and joy -- "my little tortilla," as she 
sometimes calls it -- is a proposed bill she has been working on, in concert 
with such minority groups as the Urban League and the Latino Issues Forum. The 
bill, aimed at people who go without insurance because they can't afford it, 
would provide a stripped-down, no-fault insurance package for only $160 a year, 
the trade-off being that the policyholder forfeits all rights to sue for 
damages unless they exceed $15,000 per person. 
</P>
<P>
This type of "no-frills" plan is the "real long-term solution" to escalating 
insurance prices, "the way to provide everyone with affordable prices," 
Gillespie says. To her delight, both Consumers Union and Assemblyman Patrick 
Johnston (D-Stockton) have incorporated her "no-frills" plan into a broader 
no-fault package they are sponsoring. Its backers say this package would 
provide a far-reaching no-fault system modeled on New York's -- widely 
considered the best in the nation -- that would both stabilize rates and make 
insurance accessible to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's $160-a-year plan is guaranteed to bring about a counterattack from 
trial lawyers and others who op pose no-fault's limitation on damages. "It's 
the most outrageous thing she's pulled yet. It's racist," Rosenfield declares. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah!" Gillespie sighs. "Why don't they let the poor make their own choices? The 
bottom line is, how the heck can we tell people they must buy insurance if it's 
not affordable? If it comes down to a choice between buying groceries or paying 
$2,000 for insurance, what do you think the choice is going to be?" 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also has always insisted that, even if she doesn't like Proposition 
103, she has been doing her best to enforce it, given the limitations imposed 
by the six-month legal delay. (When the insurance companies brought suit 
immediately after the November election, challenging the constitutionality of 
103, the Supreme Court imposed a freeze on both the rollback and rate-increase 
provisions pending its decision.) 
</P>
<P>
She cites her much-publicized intervention when Travelers attempted to pull its 
auto-insurance business out of California last fall to escape 103, and her 
settlement of a State Farm rate discrimination case earlier this year. "We 
really cracked down, and it was strictly implementation of Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Gillespie's tough talk, however, State Farm officials had no specific 
gripes about her treatment of them -- or her public statements chastising the 
company. "Some of her (State Farm) statements were clearly geared to the 
political climate, and we understood that," says State Farm vice 
president-counsel Laura Sullivan, who has known Gillespie for years and likes 
her. "She's getting tarred with political statements, so she's responding with 
some too. 
</P>
<P>
"Roxani's independent, smart, gutsy," Sullivan adds, "and she's not going to be 
pushed around by anybody, whether it's the insurance industry or the consumer 
groups." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Gillespie seems well-liked within the insurance industry. Such is 
her lonely lot these days, however, that, while her critics are having a field 
day at her expense, few insurance company officials will launch an all-out 
defense. Reaction is universally warm but muted. Some go out of their way, in 
fact, to find nit-picking points of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in a tough position, and I think she's doing a good job," says Tom 
Conneely, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies. "And, 
unlike these consumer activists, she understands some basic business principles 
-- one being that what a business charges for its product must reflect the cost 
of it." Gillespie also recognizes that all parties have a right to due process 
-- "one of the things that escapes the Harvey Rosenfields of this world -- and 
who are they anyhow?" Conneely declares. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Gillespie doesn't always act to please the insurance industry. For 
example, Conneely says, insurance companies "wondered for months what the 
process for rate filings is going to be, how long it will take, how they get it 
approved. If she were in the pocket of insurance companies, she'd have been 
issuing all kinds of cozy letters saying here's what you have to do to get your 
rates approved." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Gillespie will frowningly concede that, yes, "insurance companies 
have alienated everybody." But her most enthusiastic complaint about them is 
confined to the "mumbo jumbo of insurance jargon, which really must go. Nobody 
understands what they are paying for." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to profits, gouging, greed -- that which occurs to the average 
consumer when he thinks about insurance companies -- Gillespie reiterates, as 
she always does, that "of course, there are excesses on both sides." And, in 
the next breath, she intently recites her version of what actually happens to 
your insurance dollar. Most of it goes to legal claims, she asserts, "and so 
what you have is only 5 cents (of every dollar) going to administrative 
expenses." (The California Trial Lawyers Assn., by comparison, says it's 20 
cents on the dollar.) 
</P>
<P>
THERE ARE SO many competing agendas in the chorus of controversy surrounding 
Gillespie, so many politicians with eyes on higher offices and consumerists 
with a sweet tooth for national publicity, that, at times during the past 
months, Gillespie has been all but lost amid the in-house sniping over who is 
the Truest Populist of Them All. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic politicians tend to describe Gillespie's various sins more as a 
generic Republican disease. "Roxani is smart, personable, but she's no 
politician, obviously. If she were, she could become a California folk hero. 
She's just a very cautious individual, and I just think she wants to do a good 
job for Deukmejian. She once said that, you know, that 'I belong to 
Deukmejian,' " says Alan Robbins, who is considering running for insurance 
commissioner in 1990. Likewise, another leading Gillespie critic, Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, wants to be governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Political hay, all of it!" Gillespie snaps. 
</P>
<P>
For once, she and Rosenfield agree on something. "There's so much posturing in 
all this, we're the only purists," says Rosenfield, who does not take lightly 
to those attempting to horn in on the issue that is making him, at 36, famous 
-- and he's got copies of Esquire and Newsweek, among others, on his desk to 
prove it. Big, full-sized pictures. ("Aw, I hate that picture," Rosenfield 
says, grinning bashfully at himself, in shades, looking super cool, in 
Esquire.) 
</P>
<P>
It has usually been Gillespie's inaction that has most antagonized 
herconsumerist watchdogs. They are particularly bitter that she did nothing to 
stop dozens of insurance companies from using the loophole provided by the long 
court delay to raise their rates. They also complain that, through her failure 
to impose penalties on companies, even when she did act, Gillespie has set a 
permissive tone for future industry misdeeds, given a green light for anything 
from arbitrary cancellation of policies to purposeful undercharging of 
customers in fly-by-night schemes to make a fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do they see much to cheer about in the much-touted Travelers or State Farm 
cases -- neither company was inconvenienced nearly so much as their customers, 
and "she was excruciatingly slow to act in both cases," says Steven Miller, 
head of the small Insurance Consumer Action Network. 
</P>
<P>
Not least, Gillespie's critics saw her utter contempt for Proposition 103 writ 
large in her refusal to begin early hiring, writing regulations and taking 
other steps to swing into action if the court upheld the measure. Gillespie, 
who did predict that "the court can never uphold that thing in its entirety -- 
it's unconstitutional," insists that she had been preparing all along and will 
be ready to begin rate hearings by July. 
</P>
<P>
BUT IN ALL these long months, nothing has better captured the full flavor of 
the case of Gillespie vs. the Consumerists than the public hearing she held in 
March to investigate a 9.6% rate increase by State Farm, California's largest 
auto insurer. The State Farm rate hike, announced in January, only three months 
after passage of Proposition 103, ignited consumerists as little else could. To 
them, it was the insurance industry at its most arrogant, and an added economic 
burden to thousands of policyholders who were shelling out an extra $14 million 
a month in premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said her hearing would demonstrate her full intent to implement the 
people's will "in the spirit of 103 -- to spread sunshine." Assorted consumer 
organizations, as well as observers from Van de Kamp's office and the 
California Trial Lawyers Assn., saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
To them, Gillespie's handling of the State Farm hearing reflected her at her 
cunning, deceitful worst, posturing as a heroic watchdog of consumer interest, 
while, in fact, doing everything in the book to sabotage the intent of 
Proposition 103, starting with her delays in holding the hearings. The rate 
hike had been in effect for almost two months before Gillespie convened her 
public court. Then, when Gillespie did schedule the hearing, her department's 
attorneys first held a private meeting with State Farm attorneys. Consumer 
attorneys were not invited. "And if that's not collusion, what is?" howled 
Harry Snyder of Consumers Union. Gillespie dismisses the meeting as 
"unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
The day of the hearing, several consumer-group representatives showed up in 
full force, and the sideshow began. 
</P>
<P>
In a technical dispute over which provisions of 103 were in effect and which 
were under Supreme Court stay, consumerists, backed by Van de Kamp's office, 
argued that the hearing should resemble a courtroom proceeding, with themselves 
entitled to sufficient information and privileges to determine whether the rate 
increase was legitimate. That is not what they got. Roxani Gillespie evidently 
knows how to maintain order in the courtroom, her way. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible! A kangaroo court! Like being in Moscow!" sputtered Snyder 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry behaved very badly," Gillespie sighs. "He was really out of order. He 
just kept popping up, and he hadn't done his homework, as usual." 
</P>
<P>
"Gillespie denied us every single right of participation, of discovery mandated 
by 103," Snyder screamed. "She totally ignored legal process." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, process. Always the process," exclaims Gillespie, touching her forehead in 
mock despair. "They are so hung up with process. But the process is not for 
them. It is for the policyholders. They don't like that I used Section X as 
opposed to Section Y? What is the difference? My goal is the bottom line -- not 
Section X versus Section Y!" 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Gillespie was viewing State Farm's rate increase with the same amused 
tolerance she applies to her critics: "State Farm is pleading misery, but, it 
is in a way sort of like Donald Trump raising his rents. He doesn't really need 
it, but he will tell you that all of his buildings have to pay for themselves 
because he's in business. And that's what State Farm is saying. 'Yeah, I don't 
need it. I can put food on the table. But I'm not a charity. I'm in business.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But it's all moot now. Gillespie still hadn't made up her mind about the State 
Farm increase when the Supreme Court ruled on 103. Now, she says, the company 
will go through the same rate relief hearings, starting in July, as everyone 
else. But the public hearing wasn't wasted, Gillespie says cheerfully. "It was 
a good dress rehearsal for the types of hearings we're going to have. It was 
good training for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
IT'S THE END of the day, some of the fire has died down, Nader and Rosenfield 
are mostly forgotten. Now Gillespie, softer, quieter, wearing baggy blue jeans, 
is showing a visitor around her home, a picture-post-card, three-story 
townhouse on a San Francisco hillside overlooking the Presidio. Inside is a 
page from House Beautiful -- Persian carpets, burnished wood, antiques, bay 
windows, hand-carved ceiling friezes. In fact, Gillespie says, looking shyly 
pleased, "the blind pianist, what was his name? George Shearing used to live 
here." Gillespie and her husband, Chris, 56, bought the house when they first 
came to San Francisco. Today it must be worth a small fortune. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the oil paintings of Gillespie's ancestors that are her real treasure. 
They are all over the house, elegant portraits of dark-eyed people, period 
pieces many years old, each lovingly lighted. Now Gillespie is darting about 
like a butterfly, radiant, alighting briefly before each one to tell that 
relative's special story. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing seems to take the insurance commissioner's mind off her Proposition 103 
wars faster than the chance to discuss her rich family history. Liberators of 
Crete, field nurses, poets, both grandfathers members of the Greek Parliament, 
one of them -- chairman of the National Bank of Greece -- jailed for defying 
the Nazis during World War II. Gillespie's memories of both World War II and 
the civil war that crippled Greece into the '50s include "corpses lying in the 
streets . . . starving children." In the next breath, she's sunny again, 
describing the glories of the 15th-Century family home that she still maintains 
on the island of Corfu. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't rich, at least not by American standards," she says with quiet 
pride, lingering before a portrait of her father, a businessman, "but my family 
had certainly been comfortable for many generations. But they were also the 
kind of people who did things." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie is also the classic doting mother. She is particularly proud of 
daughter Margaret's impending career takeoff, so much more glamorous than her 
own. "She just interviewed with eight major (international law) firms -- and 
had her pick," Gillespie happily brags, leading the way down a corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing her husband's attitudes toward her career, she is typically direct: 
He's supportive, he's proud -- otherwise, he doesn't like it. "He complains 
that it's been a lot of pressure on him. And it's true. He doesn't have a woman 
whose only concern is his welfare and what he is going to eat and those kinds 
of things. It's just not the kind of environment his father had. But," she 
finishes with a laugh, "I think he's getting used to cooking his own dinner." 
</P>
<P>
And now we are in Gillespie's bedroom, admiring what is apparently her most 
prized family portrait, a pretty, dark-eyed woman who looks a little like 
Gillespie herself. This is her grandmother, she says, and, for a second, Roxani 
Gillespie is silent, reverent, a woman visiting some private shrine. 
</P>
<P>
But in the next second, she has flung open her closet door, yelping with 
frisky, defiant glee. You don't believe that she actually buys her Laura 
Ashleys by the half-dozen? Well, see for yourself. It is stupefying, this act 
-- who else but Roxani Gillespie would invite a perfect stranger to gawk into 
her closet? And what do we find? Crumpled clothes, dirty underwear, coat 
hangers on the floor? 
</P>
<P>
No. What we have here, lined up in a neat row, is a sea of dark-colored Laura 
Ashleys, maybe 50 of them, all looking just alike -- not a single deviant dress 
in the lineup. On the floor are four pairs of shoes, exactly alike -- squat 
pumps with little bows, in different colors. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie stands there laughing. "I was more conscious of my image when I 
worked at Industrial Indemnity, of course. Back then, it was very important to 
look, um, prohibitive. So I wore suits. But now," she chortles, "my idea of 
looking prohibitive is to wear black." 
</P>

Then Gillespie is excitedly discussing a trip she would make to London the 
following week to attend a big international insurers conference. She would be 
a guest speaker and also meet with the head of Lloyd's of London, she says, 
eyes dancing, plainly impressed. "The international market is becoming quite 
important in California, you know," she remarks with all the dignity befitting 
the California insurance commissioner. "And it's going to be exciting, too. 
These trips are fun."

PRIVATE LIVES: THE SILENT PARTNER; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IT COMES TO BRIDGING THE COMMUNICATION GAP, SOME MEN ARE WILLING TO LET 
WOMEN DO ALL THE TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
CAN WE TALK? I'm rarely at a loss for words. As far as I'm concerned, talking 
is a natural biological function, like breathing -- I do it all the time. Yet, 
my husband can hold his breath for hours, even days at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The silence seems deafening. "Is something bothering you?" I ask, even though I 
realize that trying to pull words from the mouth of a man in the midst of a 
mute spell is as pointless as trying to make a telephone call when the line is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Duke shakes his head. "Uh uh," he mutters. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, talking is like tennis. You need two people to play. "It's a big 
problem in a lot of marriages," says Marcia Lasswell, a Claremont family 
therapist, who adds that the quiet one is usually the man. 
</P>
<P>
Why? "Men have an easier time being silent than women," she explains. "Silence 
is almost a macho characteristic. Clint Eastwood, Gary Cooper -- they don't say 
many words, they're all action. The strong, silent type is a masculine myth. 
But women get very frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Yup. My friend Mary was once married to a man of few words. "Not only didn't he 
speak, but when I did, he said, 'Shh!' " she recalls. "He wouldn't answer 
things like, 'Let's buy a house' or 'What did you think of that movie?' I tried 
notes, I tried signal flags; he wouldn't answer. Once, after a prolonged period 
of his not talking, I went outside the house and rang the bell. He opened the 
door and asked, 'Where have you been?' 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought all that silence meant that he knew the secret of the 
universe and that in time he would impart it to me," Mary says. "But when it 
was not forthcoming, I began to think that if I killed him slowly, at least 
he'd say something like 'Ouch' or 'Stop it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Threats won't make him talk. In such extreme cases, "it's like trying to 
force someone who isn't coordinated physically to dance," Lasswell says. "These 
really silent types are basically shy. Somewhere along the line, they learned 
that speaking up didn't get them anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Shutting up doesn't get them anywhere either. "I had a couple where the man was 
so nonverbal that he really had a terrible time," Lasswell recalls. "His wife 
yearned to hear the words 'I love you,' and he just couldn't get it out. So, we 
practiced and practiced. I told her to say it first so that he would feel safe. 
So she turned to him and said, 'I love you.' And he said, 'Ditto.' " 
</P>
<P>
Recently, starved for conversation, I called my friend Claire. "I'm trapped in 
the Silent Zone," I said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
"He must be angry," Claire concluded. "Fred always clams up when he's 
absolutely furious. I figure it's just as well, because if he said something, 
it would be something that I didn't want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
"Duke's not mad," I assured her. (It's easy to tell when a quiet man is mad. He 
storms into the house, slams the door and hits the wall, and when you ask 
what's wrong, he snaps, "Nothing.") "He's just not speaking." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go insane," Claire said. "I'd send myself into a busy little circle 
wondering why he isn't talking. Pretty soon, I would start tossing plates 
around." 
</P>
<P>
We don't have that many dishes. Besides, "you shouldn't take the silence 
personally," Lasswell insists. "You've got to remember that he didn't just 
start being silent when he married you." 
</P>
<P>
Don't I know it. After a year of dating, I still didn't know where Duke went to 
high school. It's not that he conceals anything. He just doesn't go out of his 
way to reveal it. 
</P>
<P>
Some day, I expect to find a ticket to Stockholm lying on the dresser. "What's 
this?" I'll ask. After 10 minutes of cross-examination, he'll reluctantly 
inform me that he's won the Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if I ever won, I'd tell everyone in the city in a matter of seconds. So 
would my friend Jane, another life of the party, who's been married to a 
taciturn man for 37 years. She's still trying to adjust. "You can't out-silence 
them," Jane marvels. "Things come up in this world like 'Hello' or 'The house 
is on fire.' You've just got to teach them that it's important to say, 'I'm 
home' when they walk through the door so you don't have to worry it's a 
robber." 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that it's easier to teach a dog to "speak." My friend Monica agrees. 
"Jack can go through an entire family outing without saying a thing," she 
laments. "But it makes me very nervous. So the last time we went to my parents' 
for dinner, I asked him to please try to act interested. He said, 'I can't. I 
don't relate.' I said, 'Just try to say something to do with something they're 
talking about,' and he replied, 'I've got to be me.' Finally, I asked, 'Could 
you at least lean forward when they're talking?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I feel guilty for talking more than my mate. But someone has to 
shoulder the conversational burden. "I suppose the worst thing for a man who 
doesn't talk would be a woman who doesn't either," Jane says. "He'd go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree. "I enjoy someone who's pretty much of a brass band more than 
someone who's just a flute," declares Glen Esterly, co-author of "The Talk 
Book: The Intimate Science of Communicating in Close Relationships." Esterly, a 
self-described "silent man in a state of flux," admits: "An extrovert takes 
away the pressure to avoid what's referred to as awkward silence. If I'm going 
through quiet periods and I'm with a quiet woman, there's a lot of dead air 
time. I'm not uncomfortable with the silence, but most people are." 
</P>
<P>
Yup. Duke is lying in bed, reading about irregular Spanish verbs. "Soon, he'll 
be able to be silent as fluently in Spanish as he is in English," I think. 
"Buenas noches," I say, giving him a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
"Mi charladorita," Duke says fondly. "My little chatterbox."

OUTTAKES: GREAT BALLS OF . . . HYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sources tell us that Orion Pictures plans to spend more than $10 million on 
"media buys" (TV and print ads), a glitzy PR junket and premiere parties to 
launch its Jerry Lee Lewis musical bio, "Great Balls of Fire" (it opens in 
1,200 theaters on June 30). That's more than half the amount of the film's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O. Glenn, exec marketing veep, admitted, "It's a multi-million-dollar 
campaign, without question." The "Great Balls" hoopla kicks off June 13, when 
Jer Lee gets a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. (Ceremonies are set for 
12:30 p.m. at 6631 Hollywood Blvd.) Then: 
</P>
<P>
* A PR junket in Memphis for 300 film and music reporters, June 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
* A June 26 world premiere at NYC's restored 1,300-seat Ziegfeld Theater, with 
a post-party at The Ritz. Star Dennis Quaid and The Killer will make the 
eight-block journey in a '59 Caddy convertible. 
</P>
<P>
* A glitzy L.A. media/VIP screening on June 29 at the Director's Guild, 
followed by a bash at the Hard Rock Cafe. Jer Lee may perform. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new "Great Balls" single -- by Jer Lee and Quaid -- is getting 
airplay and the video has just hit MTV.

SOPHISTICATED BARBECUES EXPAND THE RANGE OF PATIO COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The simple braziers that grilled our hamburgers and frankfurters back in the 
'50s and '60s haven't exactly become obsolete, but they've certainly been 
overshadowed by current offerings. With adjustable heat for grilling, covers 
for smoking, auxiliary burners, griddles and woks, the new grills suggest that 
practically the entire kitchen has moved outdoors. It's becoming as common to 
prepare breakfast in the back yard as it is an evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the choice between cooking over charcoal or with gas was 
strictly personal. Charcoal grills were often favored because they cost less, 
are quite portable and because charcoal imparts a distinctive aroma and flavor 
to food. In fact, a spokesman for the Southern California Gas Co., representing 
the competition to charcoal grilling, acknowledges that there are many positive 
associations with the smell of briquettes. "Even the smell of starter fluid can 
make your mouth water," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Gas, on the other hand, is recognized as clean, quick and easy. Now, additional 
factors are emerging that may make gas grilling a more attractive option. In 
March, the South Coast Air Quality Management District approved a plan that 
could lead to a ban on the sale of grills or barbecues "that require starter 
fluid." The plan also calls for starter fluid to be reformulated with fewer 
smog-producing ingredients and would restrict its use on summer's smoggiest 
days. Each measure of the plan must be approved by the 12-member board after 
public hearings, which are now in progress. The rules regarding barbecues are 
set to be adopted in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the AQMD said the district recognizes that the wording of the 
plan is inaccurate -- there really aren't any barbecues that require starter 
fluid -- and that will be modified before the plan comes before the board. The 
final measure is more likely to require charcoal users to ignite it with 
something other than starter fluid, such as an electric or chimney starter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to environmental concerns, economics may help push gas grills to 
the forefront. According to gas company calculations, cost per cookout for 
charcoal plus lighter fluid is $1.69, contrasted with 6 cents for natural gas 
and 19 cents for propane. Over three years, figuring two cookouts per week 
during a nine-month period, cost for charcoal was $394.52; natural gas, $13.27; 
propane, $44.08. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line? "I think gas is going to be the only way left to grill," says 
Stuart McDonald, president of Barbeques Galore, a chain with eight outlets in 
Southern California. Though sales volume is still in charcoal, only a small 
portion of McDonald's inventory is charcoal grills. "We're very much geared for 
the gas consumer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest development in the last couple years is gas units without volcanic 
(sometimes called lava) rock or pumice stone," McDonald adds. Weber introduced 
one of the first units, which uses patented, porcelain-on-steel bars that 
vaporize juices. 
</P>
<P>
Charmglow of Illinois has developed a grate with perforations that its makers 
claim will "help spread heat more evenly and vaporize meat juices quickly for 
more smoked barbecue flavor." Minnesota-based Nordic's answer is a four-piece 
design of porcelain-coated grill louvers that vaporize drippings and distribute 
heat. Pro-Chef, another industry leader, features a similar design. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald says the jury is still out on whether these new designs are superior 
to gas-fired, volcanic-rock barbecues. He continues to use the latter in his 
own Australian Turbo Gas Grill because he believes that rock is still superior 
for generating the high heat necessary to sear meat quickly. He also cautions 
that non-rock units must have efficient grease catchers for drainage and to 
prevent flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's Turbo unit can be mounted on a portable cart or built into an 
outdoor entertainment center. It offers a choice of three to five burners, an 
optional griddle and an auxiliary burner that accommodates a wok. South 
Carolina-based Ducane offers a gas grill that combines the volcanic-rock system 
with louver cooking. It has two layers of offset, V-shape runners that vaporize 
juices at the bottom and a separate vertical burner across the back for 
rotisserie cooking using pumice briquettes. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to mild weather, Southern Californians can cook outdoors almost any 
time. Outdoor entertainment areas, enhanced by state-of-the-art grills, offer a 
versatile new way to extend living space. "When you say 'barbecue,' " McDonald 
says, "you immediately think of casual, relaxed entertaining. Yet with 
sophisticated new grills, you can prepare almost anything and present it 
elegantly."

A BACK-YARD ROTISSERIE MEANS COOLER COOKING -- EVEN FOR ROAST LEG OF LAMB

</HEADLINE>

Now foods that require longer, slower cooking can move outdoors. The newest 
patio "entertainment centers" serve as mini-kitchens and feature rotisseries, 
covered grills and indirect heat (a method in which meat or poultry is roasted, 
over a drip pan, by heat sources on either side). Some elaborate setups even 
have sinks and refrigerators. One of the benefits of these sophisticated 
cooking centers is that, weather permitting, virtually all food preparation can 
move to the back yard. Best of all, the new units let you cook a roast -- a 
long, hot job in a regular oven -- without raising the temperature in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Roasts cooked on an outdoor rotisserie are crispy on the outside; yet the meat 
remains moist. This is especially true of a boneless leg of lamb stuffed with 
curried dried fruit, then marinated and basted with a Sauvignon Blanc-based 
marinade. To ensure succulence, check internal temperature during the final 30 
minutes of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Whole onions can be roasted along with the meat, either tucked into the coals 
or in the drip pan. Remove any loose skins, but don't peel or cut the onions. 
Roast about one hour or until tender, turning several times.

GARDENS: AN OLD PEPPER; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE QUINTESSENTIAL CALIFORNIA GARDEN, THE INHABITANTS AREN'T NECESSARILY 
NATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
IT IS NOT OFTEN CALLED by its botanical name, Schinus molle, perhaps because, 
said aloud, it might sound like a sneeze followed by a polite apology. One 
reference suggests skye-nus as the way to pronounce it. 
</P>
<P>
We call it the California pepper, believing it to be native to this state. Down 
under, it is called the Australian pepper, locals there apparently making the 
same assumption. Brought here from its homeland in Peru, it was one of the 
first trees cultivated in California by the Mission fathers, and it has been 
here long enough to have given us some remarkably gnarled specimens. One, 
identified by some as the oldest, is being enclosed in a newly refurbished 
garden at the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, the most affluent of the old 
missions, located between San Juan Capistrano and San Diego. Another notable 
planting is an official Historic-Cultural Monument for the City of Angels -- 
the pepper trees, planted in the 1920s, that overhang Canoga Avenue from 
Ventura Boulevard south to Saltillo Street. And another street collection has 
added some notoriety to the pepper's resume: the peppers lining Euclid Avenue 
in Upland -- trees that a few years ago began to rot and drop heavy limbs on 
passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
The pepper pictured here is also quite old but new to its garden. Found growing 
in a vacant lot and estimated to be 35 to 40 years old at the time, it was 
moved here to give the garden an "understated and established" look, according 
to the landscape architects Jerry Cummings Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is as distinctively Californian as the pepper tree; that is, none of 
the plants are natives, but they are enthusiastically at home here just the 
same. The pepper's tallest companions are pigmy date palms and giant 
bird-of-paradise. The bold accents to the left are cycads (commonly called Sago 
palms), and to the right, agapanthus. All of these nearby plantings are 
drought-resistant, as is the pepper, which can survive on rainfall alone. 
(Peppers can tolerate soil with poor drainage as long as the soil does not get 
too wet.) 
</P>
<P>
Azaleas make up most of the shrubbery in the garden. The prettiest is a Gold 
Cup hybrid named 'Baby Jill,' which makes the pink clouds in the distance 
beneath the giant bird-of-paradise. They in turn are set off with plantings of 
purple and blue cinerarias in winter and New Guinea impatiens in summer, a 
scheme developed by the master gardeners who care for the property, Patrick 
Turnbull and Collie Valadez. 
</P>
<P>
The paving is porous (broken concrete with Bermuda grass planted in the gaps) 
to ensure that air and some water get to the tree's far-reaching roots. Peppers 
are susceptible to root rots, and to ensure that this tree does not receive too 
much water, nothing is planted within a 6-foot radius of its base, and 
sprinklers are aimed away from the trunk. At first the presence of azaleas 
seems to reflect a mistake in planning a drought-resistant scheme designed to 
protect a tree that doesn't like too much water. However, azaleas actually need 
far less water than they are usually given. Here they are a good 10 feet away 
from the trunk, and both the azaleas and the cinerarias get regular 
irrigations. 
</P>
<P>
The roots of pepper trees grow near the surface and can pose a problem, another 
reason that nothing is planted at the very base of this tree. Peppers should 
definitely be kept away from sewers and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
As for the heart rot that brought the notoriety to the peppers of Upland, that 
can be prevented if all large pruning wounds are sealed promptly and properly. 
Peppers also are prey to a tiny psyllid; this particular tree is sprayed 
commercially twice a year with Dursban. 
</P>
<P>
Another complaint heard about California peppers is that they drop a lot of 
litter -- tiny branches, leaves and peppercorns. But in this garden, the litter 
is effectively absorbed by the plantings underneath. I remember trying to 
bicycle to school down a street lined with old peppers -- no small trick 
considering the billions of peppercorns that made the street as unstable as a 
linoleum floor covered with ball-bearings. Offsetting that recollection are 
memories of the pleasant dappled shade the trees cast on hot September days and 
the wonderfully warm smell of peppercorns crushed by the balloon tires on a 
Schwinn Cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
Some people would say that the pepper tree's susceptibility to rots and 
psyllid, its aggressive roots and its messy manner make it a poor choice for a 
garden. But when properly sited, what else has such grace and grandeur, with

LOOKS: NEWER WAVES;

<P>
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES MAKE THE TIME-HONORED PERM BETTER THAN EVER

SOME CALL them kinky. Some say they stink. And others just plain hate them. Yet 
80% of salon patrons won't face their mirrors without a perm. According to 
Modern Salon, a hair-care industry trade journal, permanent waves are the 
second-most-requested service after haircuts in U.S. beauty shops. Despite the 
proliferation of gels, mousses and curling tools, perms remain popular because 
of the long-lasting body, versatility and wash-and-wear convenience they 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the public's love-hate relationship with the perm, manufacturers 
and stylists are in constant pursuit of the perfect wave. Faster, odor-free or 
perfumed solutions, imaginatively designed rods and updated application 
techniques are all intended to eliminate the perm's negative connotation, while 
creating fashionable soft curls. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial wave process has come a long way since the 1920s, when women sat 
for hours with their hair attached to a curling machine. Today a client can 
have a perm in less than an hour. Redken's new Velocity 5 cuts processing time 
to five minutes, a dramatic advance over the typical 20 to 45 minutes that 
other processes require. Most perm solutions break and reconfigure the protein 
bonds in the hair shaft using thioglycolic acid, which can damage the hair 
unless conditioners are used. By contrast, Velocity 5 accelerates the 
rearrangement of protein bonds using an ingredient called Synchron E. 
</P>
<P>
But speed isn't the only improvement. "The trend now is to leave the hair in 
superior condition after it's permed," says Henri Mastey, president of Mastey 
de Paris, a Valencia-based hair-care manufacturer. Conditioners are added to 
most high-quality perms to prevent burning and drying. Some, such as Zotos 
International's Bain de Terre Spa Conditioning Perm, have natural additives 
including plankton and ginseng. Other conditioning perms are promoted like 
skin-care products, touting "protective" collagen, elastin and exotic herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills stylist Edward Anthony, who administers the Ve Borne perm, says 
many clients who are sensitive to the acids and harsh salts in regular perms 
opt for this 30- to 45-minute process, which uses vegetable proteins to curl 
the hair. "Ladies who want to have a perm and color at the same time prefer 
this organic approach," Anthony says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the term permanent, how long a wave lasts depends on the type of 
solution used. Mastey's non-ammonia Volumineux Volumetric Perm and Zotos' 
Acclaim are both acid waves. According to Lynn Plant, spokesperson for Zotos, 
acid-based solutions provide softer, looser curls than do longer-lasting, 
alkaline-based solutions. 
</P>
<P>
This year American women are paying $30 to $250 for the convenience of having 
three months' worth of tumbling curls or gentle waves that they can style in 
many different ways. Recent innovations may raise the price of perms even 
higher in the 1990s. But, as Modern Salon editor Mary Atherton maintains: 
"Women are not about to give up their perms. The versatility is worth the 
price."

MUSIC NEWS: DELOS EMERGES ON THE ROAD TO SOLVENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delos International, the Southern California-based recording company which 
filed for protection under Chapter 11 last October, is beginning to emerge from 
the shadows cast by the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of coming out of (bankruptcy) involves a lot of steps," said Delos 
founder and president Amelia Haygood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on the first one now. But, it's like getting A's in school: If you can 
continue doing it, and put in the time, chances are, you'll graduate." 
</P>
<P>
One of the more positive moves toward Delos' eventual graduation is its recent 
signing of a distribution agreement with its colleague and Hollywood neighbor, 
A&amp;M Records. In this arrangement, A&amp;M carries out an expanded 
distribution and marketing program for Delos. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rudi Simpson, Delos' director of promotion: "Though (Delos) will 
be working with A&amp;M on both advertising and marketing, those areas will be 
mostly in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Among the potential positive effects of this new division, Simpson said, are 
"an increase in unit sales and a reduction in overhead costs." In the meantime, 
"we will continue to develop the artistic side. Delos will remain Delos." 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old recording company, founded by Haygood in 1973, has a reputation 
as a high-quality, audiophile-pleasing house. It holds the distinction of 
having produced Eugene Ormandy's final recordings with the Philadelphia 
Orchestra; its current roster of artists includes pianists John Browning and 
Carol Rosenberger, soprano Arleen Auger, conductors Gerard Schwarz and James 
DePreist and their respective Northwest orchestras -- the Seattle and Oregon 
Symphonies -- clarinetist David Shifrin and the Orford Quartet, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion in the artistic arena can now proceed, Simpson says, promising to 
announce new recording projects -- as well as new artists -- in the near 
future. He expects to begin recording in August. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are up and running," Simpson said, "This period of reorganization 
starts to look very interesting. Among other things, we have streamlined our 
operation. And we've learned who our friends were." 
</P>
<P>
OLD SONGS: First in a series of two lectures sponsored by the California Museum 
of Ancient Art, Ann Kilmer's "Music of the Ancient Near East: The World's 
Oldest Song" will be delivered June 21 at 7:30 p.m. in Piness Auditorium at the 
Wilshire Boulevard Temple, 3663 Wilshire Blvd. Kilmer, professor of Near 
Eastern studies at UC Berkeley, has produced a recording titled "Sounds From 
Silence" on which she presents, on a replica of an ancient Sumerian, 
bull-headed lyre, a song 3,400 years old, which she deciphered on a clay tablet 
found in Syria. The tablet contained two sections of cuneiform text. The first 
section turned out to be lyrics to the song, a religious hymn in praise of the 
Hurrian moon goddess, Nikkal. Utilizing a number of other ancient texts known 
as "Theory Tablets," Kilmer and an international team of experts translated the 
second section, which was musical notation for the words in the first section.

 Lucia Popp, Marjana Lipovsek; Chorus of the Bavarian Radio; Munich Radio 
Orchestra conducted by Giuseppe Patane. Eurodisc 7806-2-RC(compact disc). This 
last panel of Eurodisc's "Trittico," and the weakest performance of the three, 
acquires its Italianate aura from Patane's leisurely, authoritative leadership, 
rather than from any members of its mid-European cast. Popp's sinning nun 
brings dramatic credibility to a narrative severely lacking in that quality, 
but the breathy slides and compromised top notes mark a decline in this gifted 
soprano's career. Lipovsek's princess supplies frayed, hysterical vocalism, 
where the role demands stony imperiousness. Eurodisc's limited banding is no 
help. ALLAN ULRICH

New York Philharmonic conducted by Zubin Mehta; Eva Marton, soprano; Toronto 
Symphony conducted by Andrew Davis. CBS Masterworks MDK-44910 (compact disc). 
It looks like a bargain, but this midprice reissue offers value only in the 
extended Nietzsche-inspired tone poem. Mehta conducts a persuasively idiomatic 
performance, wasting little time over the bombastic introduction, preferring to 
indulge the more seductive rhetoric of the "Night Waltz," aided by Glenn 
Dicterow's suave violin. The 1980 sonics are a bit crude by today's standards. 
Marton unfortunately brings little but a generalized vehemence to the Four Last 
Songs, battling a cantilena that must soar above all worldly (and vocal) 
considerations. Davis provides lumpy accompaniment. Allan Ulrich

Porsha Martin, the group's third female lead singer, makes her debut on this 
album, bridging the gap between original singer Sharon Bryant's strong, gutsy 
soulfulness and her successor Barbara Weathers' creamier crossover flavoring. 
Martin gets to solo on only one track here ("Don't Start the Fire"), and it's 
not even a particularly good one. Founding members David and Wayne Lewis save 
the best cuts for themselves, although the vocal pairing of Martin and Wayne 
Lewis on "My First Love" results in a polished showcase for them both. 
Continuing to move in a pop direction, Atlantic Starr can attribute its success 
to well-crafted songs and its crafty selection of stand-out female group 
members to help embellish them. Connie Johnson

POP STARS: ***** Great Balls of Fire **** Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good 
Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't That a Shame 
</P>
<P>
The most affecting moments in McCartney's best solo album in more than a decade 
remind us that it has been 25 years since the giddy exuberance of "I Want to 
Hold Your Hand." 
</P>
<P>
Where the Beatles' early work celebrated the innocence, energy and optimism of 
a generation that believed it truly was different, "Flowers in the Dirt" 
focuses on how that generation -- now approaching middle age -- is more likely 
to be quietly exploring the same sobering questions that people have raised 
throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
If the 12 songs don't ever come out and directly ask, "What's it all about, 
Alfie?," the best ones do touch on root-matters of life; they are gentle 
expressions of personal and spiritual love, often set against the approaching 
gray cloud of mortality suggested by the grave-site image of the title. 
</P>
<P>
The large cast of musicians includes Elvis Costello, who co-wrote four songs 
and provides a sharp, Lennonesque bite in the brassy, desperate "You Want Her 
Too." But McCartney's clear and disarming personal vision marks the most 
haunting moments: the parent-child affection of "Put It There," the romantic 
devotion of "This One," the prayerlike grace of "Motor of Love" and the 
nostalgic toast of "We Got Married." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons McCartney's solo work has been so erratic is that he often 
finds it difficult to reveal himself. When he allows himself to be intimate, he 
can be an especially poignant artist. The best moments of "Flowers in the Dirt" 
showcase that intimacy. ROBERT HILBURN

THE SPARKS IN EXTREME SHAPE THE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANISS GARZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Band: Extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel: Gary Cherone, vocals; Nuno Bettencourt, guitar; Pat Badger, bass; 
Paul Geary, drums. 
</P>
<P>
History: When Bettencourt first encountered vocalist Cherone, it was animosity 
at first sight. Cherone's band, the Dream, was headlining a show and his 
then-guitarist haughtily kicked the openers -- Bettencourt's group -- out of 
the communal dressing room. A couple of years later, in 1985, when Bettencourt 
and Cherone ran across each other once again, sparks flew -- but they were 
sparks of inspiration. "We hit it off as writers," recalled Cherone in a recent 
interview. "We were the missing link for each other." Bettencourt's sense of 
musical adventure fit perfectly with Cherone's wild lyrical ideas and a tightly 
knit songwriting team was born. Cherone pulled Geary, the Dream's drummer, into 
the project and a few months later they recruited Badger. The members' combined 
reputations on the local scene gave Extreme immediate drawing power in 
Boston-area clubs. By November '87, when the group was signed to A&amp;M 
Records, Extreme had been named Outstanding Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Act at the 
Boston Music Awards for two years straight -- an honor that the band earned 
again in '88. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: Extreme's frolic through the hard rock arena is winsome and colorful. 
Its self-titled debut album contains a jumble of moods, from the goofy and 
childlike "Mutha" and "Play With Me" to the classically inspired "Rock A Bye 
Bye," which pensively tackles the issue of abortion. On several other numbers 
it spends time exploring blues-based rock, but with a funky beat that's 
appealingly different. The group is tightly orchestrated, which gives its songs 
a complexity rare in its musical genre. Bettencourt's array of psychotic 
noodlings and noises should satisfy most guitar aficionados, but his secret 
weapon is his strong sense of rhythm playing. Cherone's brazen vocals can bump 
and grind through the rougher tunes, then turn around and become hauntingly 
emotive. Extreme's well-rounded understanding of rock 'n' roll and 
well-developed imagination bring a fresh edge to the tried-and-true form.

ART NEWS: WINOGRAND LOOKS AT THE U.S.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Photographer Garry Winogrand endured miserable professional failures. When he 
published a collection of images of women, women were offended and men 
perplexed. A book of pictures of the zoo was a resounding commercial flop. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who loved zoos were perhaps distressed by the book's irreverent dark 
humor, which saw the animals as no more clearly noble than their human 
visitors," writes John Szarkowski, who organized the first Winogrand 
retrospective, a traveling exhibit running Saturday through Aug. 20 at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, Winogrand earned an essential reputation as an important 
chronicler of American life before he died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes out of a tradition of Walker Evans and Robert Frank," said Connie 
Wolf, MOCA project director. "He could capture the movements and interactions 
of a city and of American life." 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 images from the 1950s to the 1980s make up the "Garry Winogrand" 
survey, organized by New York's Museum of Modern Art. It is divided into nine 
sections representing subject matter ranging from the Eisenhower years to 
women, to the zoo, to the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"The photographs for the most part are not flattering, they are not beautiful 
or spectacular portraits, but they capture an essence of America at the time 
they were produced," Wolf said. Whether photographing people on the streets of 
Beverly Hills or New York City, he infused everyday occurances with an element 
of drama and mystery. "He took the ordinary and made people look at the 
ordinary in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
More than a third of a million unfinished exposures were left behind when 
Winogrand died. Many of these have been processed, and the exhibit features 25 
prints and 40 slides from this body of work. 
</P>
<P>
Ten nearly life-size, enlarged contact sheets also included act as a window 
into Winogrand's creative process, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each (blow up) contains an image in the show. This allows a viewer to look at 
what Winogrand went through as he photographed America, then selected the one 
image to print and sign and call his own." 
</P>
<P>
ART ACTION: Convinced that the government is failing its responsibility in 
fighting AIDS, Tortue Gallery director Mallory Freeman has organized his second 
silent bid auction to raise money for the cause. 
</P>
<P>
The event, titled "Every Fourteen Minutes," doubles as an exhibit and will run 
at the Santa Monica gallery Saturday through July 8. During that time, bids may 
be made on painting, sculpture and graphics by more than 165 top Los Angeles 
artists. Local art dealers and collectors have also donated works. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, who raised $87,000 with a similar auction in 1987, said recently that 
he never intended to repeat the effort. "It's so much work, it's mind-boggling 
for a gallery to take on. But the need is greater than it ever was. It is not 
being filled by the local, state or federal government in any substantial way, 
and it simply behooves the private sector to do what it can for the greatest 
pandemic we've ever known, certainly in this century." 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds from the event will benefit three local AIDS service 
organizations: The Los Angeles Shanti Foundation, Minority AIDS Project and 
Milagros Project. Freeman included the latter two because, as minority 
organizations, they have great difficulty raising funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the artists to be featured are Carlos Almaraz, Don Bacardy, Billy Al 
Bengston, Sam Francis, Jill Giegerich, Jim Morphesis, Robert Natkin, Jon 
Swihart and Joyce Treiman. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the auction's artists have donated first-rate examples of their work, 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
An opening reception will be held Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. Admission is a $10 
donation payable at the door. A closing reception for final bidding is 
scheduled for July 8, 5-7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Local artists will also donate their works for an auction to raise funds for 
artist Amy Goldman's medical expenses. It is scheduled for next Sunday from 2 
p.m. to 5 p.m. at USC's Fisher Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, former director of art education at USC's School of Fine Arts, was 
left paralyzed on one side a year ago by a brain tumor. Her medical costs have

MARATTA AND THE LETTER CAMPAIGN FOR 'BEAUTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being one of those folks behind the write-in campaign to save television series 
"Beauty and the Beast," I have to say that Maratta's May 28 cartoon is 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
I am not offended by the implication that I am "beastly" or disfigured. What 
bothers me and saddens me is the apparent lack of understanding of why I and 
others have written to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"Beauty and the Beast" is a touching, beautifully mounted, very literate 
series. I have no desire to see yet another lame-brained detective show or pair 
of sitcoms about "a bunch o' zany but lovable folks" in its time slot. 
</P>

"Beauty and the Beast" has received a new order for 12 episodes from CBS, for 
midseason, the producers of the offbeat fantasy series say. In a May 25 Morning 
Report item on the new order, a production company executive refers to the 
"very loyal and significant audience" of the series.

Mourning the death of KEDG, Carolina P. Briones lashes out at "myopic 
capitalistic greed" (Letters, May 21). I have a suggestion: Let her take out a 
license, buy a building, fill it with a transmitter and other electronic 
equipment, buy the records she likes, hire a staff and go on the air. 
</P>
<P>
I'll look forward to her next letter, in which she explains exactly how she 
accomplished her first year of successful programming.

AN INDIANA MYTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, Sheila Benson can't understand why Indy dallies with a Nazi ice priestess 
in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (May 28, "Losing Sight of the Reasons 
for Success"). Writer/executive producer George Lucas' literary allusion here 
was about as subtle as a poke in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
The latest in the "Indiana Jones" series is an updating of the centuries-old 
legend of Parsifal. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Connery plays the analogue to Parsifal's father-figure Amfortas, whose 
wound in the side can be healed only by the Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
John Rhys-Davies represents Klingsor, lord of a Teutonic castle of doom and 
chief rival for the Grail. 
</P>
<P>
And Allison Doody, of course, is Kundry, that infinitely complicated character 
who remains in flux between the forces of light and darkness and who works her 
seductive wiles on both Amfortas and Parsifal in turn. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell inspired Lucas' attempt to 
play out this ancient drama in 1930s dress. 
</P>
<P>
Benson should look up the recording of Campbell's retelling of Von Eschenbach's 
"Parzival." It's more exciting than the Jones version. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN CANNON 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's article refers to Campbell and, indirectly, to the Parsifal myth in 
the sentence: "For a film that is supposed to have grown from Lucas' 
fascination with myth and legend as taught by Joseph Campbell, this embracing 
of one of the central myths on which Hitler built his theory of the master race 
... is a little peculiar."

SOME SEE NO HUMOR IN 'SEE NO EVIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We saw the movie "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" because it was supposed to be a 
comedy and it was advertised as a box-office hit. 
</P>
<P>
We were appalled at the language . . . four-letter words used throughout the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
It made me wonder if the movies aren't to blame for the downfall of morals and 
ethics over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In the '20s and '30s actors and actresses were constantly shown with a 
cigarette, and smoking was widely accepted. It's taken all these years for 
anti-smoking crusades to educate the public. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the introduction of promiscuousness into the movies . . . the 
bordellos, madams, mistresses, etc., all seemed to be a topic of fun and 
mischievousness. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was pot smoking (even though at times it was presented as an evil). 
</P>
<P>
Now foul language has been used so much that I observed teen-agers in the 
audience laughing and even cheering whenever it was heard. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need all this in the name of entertainment? What happened to the 
movies with a moral, or with a story to present, or with a happy ending? A few 
that come to mind are: "An Affair to Remember," "With Six You Get Egg Roll," 
"It Happened One Night" and "Karate Kid." 
</P>
<P>
I suggest movie and TV script writers and producers clean up their act. 
Whatever happened to "Speak No Evil"?

SOME SEE NO HUMOR IN 'SEE NO EVIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am debating whether to see the new movie comedy smash, "See No Evil, Hear No 
Evil" or wait for the sequel, which is sure to be on the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine what the stars, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder (who play a blind 
man and a deaf man, respectively) and producer Marvin Worth and director Arthur 
Hiller could do with epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease? 
Wouldn't those be blockbusters? 
</P>
<P>
And kudos to such eminent critics as Kevin Thomas (May 12 review) for 
possessing a sense of humor that I obviously lack. 
</P>
<P>
Is there no decency left in a society in search of the dollar?

PUEBLO POTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE PUEBLO artists of the American Southwest have created ceramics that, in 
form and design, compare favorably with pottery made in more sophisticated 
parts of the world. These artists functioned -- and still function -- without 
the aid of a potter's wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians who have occupied pueblos in Arizona and New Mexico for nearly 
2,000 years were the first North Americans to create true pottery. Best-known 
of the pueblos are those of the Hopi in Arizona and, in New Mexico, those of 
the Zuni, Acoma, Laguna, Santa Clara and San Ildefonso Indians. Pottery 
techniques were passed from older to younger women, although occasionally men 
were involved in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Primitive techniques have resulted in the loveliest and most sophisticated 
creations. Moist clay is coiled to form the desired shape of the pottery, and 
the coils are pinched together to form a rough outline of the piece. Hands and 
fingers dipped in water further shape the vessel, which is then scraped by the 
rind of a gourd, sun-dried and sanded with a sandstone. Then a mirror-like 
finish is produced by careful polishing of the vessel with a small, oval 
pebble. Paint is applied with a strip of yucca leaf that has been drawn through 
the potter's teeth several times to create the proper shape. (A mystical 
significance surrounds the craft, because, in the eyes of Pueblo Indians, color 
is the gift of the gods.) The final firing takes place in an excavated basin or 
kiln in the ground, and the dried clay vessels are placed on supports such as 
rocks and potsherds and heated to between 600 and 900 degrees centigrade. 
</P>
<P>
Excellent pottery is made today in the Hopi pueblos, especially in some of the 
villages of First Mesa. The pueblos of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara and San Juan, 
in the northwestern Rio Grande Valley, are also centers of fine ceramic 
production. Take for example a typical Hopi polychrome jar with designs of 
opposed "bird wing" motifs adapted from ancient models; a Zuni polychrome with 
arabesque motifs and a naturalistic deer showing Apache or Navajo influence, or 
an Acoma polychrome with multiple paneled bands repeating naturalistic bird 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Most popular of all is the black ware. For 100 years, one of the centers for 
polished black ware was Santa Clara, where highly polished wedding vases with 
double necks and bear-paw motifs were common. San Ildefonso was equally 
renowned, especially for the elegant matte-black-on-burnished-black vessels, 
perfected by such famous artists as the late Maria Martinez, who rediscovered 
early black-ware firing techniques in the 1920s. Sleekly contemporary in both 
concept and execution, black ware fits well with many of today's design 
imperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Pueblo pottery is available at the Silver Man Gallery West in Los Angeles; 
Federico, Wounded Knee Gallery and Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica; White Eyes 
Indian Shop in Arcadia; Indian Art Center of California in Studio City; 
Caskey-Lees Gallery (by appointment only) in Topanga Canyon; Don Bennett and 
Associates (by appointment only) in Westlake Village; Ojai Indian Shop in Ojai; 
Galeria Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano, and American Indian Store in San 
Diego.

A WINE CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINE AUCTIONS HAVE become very chic with the sort of people who like to impress 
their friends at the dinner table. If you like wine and but are not in the 
Latour league, consider joining Winewrights, an organization whose members 
drink some of the world's most unusual wines -- and don't pay a fortune for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Winewrights is a sort of limited-editions club for wine drinkers. The company 
deals in wines made by dedicated wineries too tiny to distribute their wines 
through ordinary channels. These are not ma-and-pa places that make swill that 
one would be embarrassed to serve. To the contrary, some of the country's most 
prestigious wines (Bonny Doon, Kalin, Laurel Glen and Randy Dunn) were first 
distributed through Winewrights. Recently, Winewrights members were offered the 
latest Chardonnay from Merry Vintners for only $99.50 a case. 
</P>
<P>
A membership with Winewrights includes "The Winewrights Register," a 256-page 
book profiling the wine makers whose wines are sold through the club. (This is 
more than a mere catalogue -- it's a fascinating tome.) Members also receive a 
market report six times a year; it contains a variety of information, but its 
primary purpose is to inform members about the current wines that the club has 
for sale. They are good wines at good prices: Belonging to Winewrights offers 
wine aficionados one of the nicest ways to shop by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in Winewrights is $40. Write 175 B Cascade Court, Rohnert Park, 
Calif. 94928. Or telephone (800) 321-4300.

KNAPP NOT TO BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the April 23 column by James Flanigan, "We Haven't Seen the End of 
S&amp;L Crises": 
</P>
<P>
The column states that Charles Knapp "took the old Financial Corp. of America 
to bankruptcy." This is another example of The Times wrongfully blaming Knapp 
for things he did not do. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp left FCA in August, 1984. At that time, FCA was solvent and not on the 
verge of bankruptcy. Knapp was not involved in FCA's management for more than 
four years before its bankruptcy and had nothing to do with FCA's financial 
results since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
To state that Knapp "took" FCA to bankruptcy is irresponsible reporting.

SHOULDN'T CONFUSE 'SOCIALIZED' MEDICINE WITH 'SOCIALISM' -- THEY ARE NOT THE 
SAME THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before basking in the glow of Bernstein's vision of "a drastically changed 
health-care system," we should look at the facts in major industrialized 
countries that have national health-care systems offering citizens health care 
not based on their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, such countries as Great Britain and Sweden that have national health 
financing programs do not effectively provide a paradise of universal health 
care because delays in providing care and arbitrary bureaucratic restrictions 
that effectively ration care conspire to exclude a significant number of Brits 
and Swedes from receiving medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Trading one bad system of health-care delivery for another is no bargain.

SHOULDN'T CONFUSE 'SOCIALIZED' MEDICINE WITH 'SOCIALISM' -- THEY ARE NOT THE 
SAME THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his May 9 labor column, "After 40 years, Truman Is Proved Right on Health 
Care," Harry Bernstein reports that not only Lee A. Iacocca but also "a 
coalition of executives from many of the nation's largest corporations" have 
concluded that the only viable solution to spiraling medical care costs in the 
United States is the passage of a national health-care program. 
</P>
<P>
As Bernstein notes, opponents of a national program in the past have "falsely 
denounced it as 'socialized medicine.' " Evidently, the word "socialized" has 
become to some people synonymous with the word "socialism," which it is not. 
</P>
<P>
As defined by my dictionary, "socialized" means "to convert or adapt to the 
needs of society." 
</P>
<P>
Although generally not referred to as such, our police department is, in 
reality, a socialized police department, serving the needs of our society. Our 
socialized fire department also serves the needs of our society. No less 
important, the needs of our society should also be served with socialized 
medicine.

PROPOSED TRADE LAW SANCTIONS ARE CREDIBLE WARNING, NOT PROTECTIONIST PLOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES SRODES, JAMES SRODES is the Washington bureau chief for Financial 
World magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the Bush Administration named Japan, Brazil and India as unfair 
traders 10 days ago, the action has been roundly denounced as first step in a 
pell-mell rush by the White House to the disastrous days of Smoot-Hawley 
protectionism. Dire predictions of retaliation, a world trade war and worse 
have filled our business news pages. 
</P>
<P>
But a dash of perspective might be useful at the moment. First, even a casual 
look around reveals that the world and America's place in it bears no 
resemblance to that faced by Sen. Reed Smoot when he devised his system of 
tariffs in 1930. Not only is the world not reeling from a global financial 
collapse, the clear objective of the Bush trade offensive is to open foreign 
markets to American products, not to close off the United States to the very 
people overseas who manufacture so much of our own prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that the trade sanctions threatened by the White House 
represent a brutal and selfish break with America's tradition of free trade and 
a cowardly capitulation to the narrower interests of some of the President's 
big business friends. Such a notion is history of the daffiest kind, to begin 
with. It also ignores a week of headlines that have followed the formal 
complaints leveled against the three nations. 
</P>
<P>
What has gone on as Bush, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla A. Hills have shuttled from Brussels to other capitals is 
that America's NATO allies have been confronted with a set of U.S. policies 
that are all of one piece. That is to say, the White House is willing to 
discuss and negotiate anything and everything, and it has linked our defense 
posture and our foreign policies firmly with our trade policies -- just as 
Europeans have for centuries and just as we did in the days of the Marshall 
Plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Integrating Policies 
</P>
<P>
In short, there is something more serious going on here than a President caving 
in to protectionist special interests. Are there dangers ahead for the American 
economy with the Bush strategy? Yes, indeed, for much of that strategy depends 
on a delicate negotiation and trade technique at which we Americans are not 
very skilled. 
</P>
<P>
But the point is this: For the first time since the end of the Vietnam War, a 
U.S. President is trying to make trade policy part of this country's foreign 
strategic policy. Instead of treating trade as a glad-handed backwater of our 
foreign aid largess, the Administration is trying to use hard bargaining, 
shrewd diplomacy and, yes indeed, the threat of reprisals to persuade our 
trading partners around the world that the same rules of open markets should 
apply to everyone. And, equally important, if all trade markets cannot be fully 
free and open, the areas off limits should be fully negotiated and above-board. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the United States could view trade with other nations as a 
painless form of foreign aid. Well into the 1970s our total volume of 
merchandise exchanged with other countries only amounted to about 12 cents of 
every dollar of annual gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
But now our trade volume is roughly 25 cents of every dollar of our economic 
growth. And we have been losing, in terms of the trade deficit, an embarrassing 
1.7 cents on every dollar's worth of trade transaction and building a trade 
deficit that annually pumps roughly $150 billion in surplus dollars into the 
hands of our trade customers -- one-third of those dollars into the hands of 
our Japanese friends alone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serves as a Warning 
</P>
<P>
While the return of those dollars in the form of foreign investments in new 
plants, real estate, corporate shares and U.S. Treasury securities has been 
welcome, America clearly cannot continue to have its foreign trade losses and 
government spending profligacies subsidized by people outside our country. One 
answer to the trade problem is to get our foreign partners to open up 
previously closed portions of their economy so that American goods and services 
can compete. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this light that Bush's so-called Super 301 unfair trade list must be 
viewed. It is not a declaration of war, but rather a credible warning that this 
time the White House intends to use all of the power levers at its disposal to 
win expanded markets for American exporters. While that means that some 
painfully protected sectors of Japanese, Brazilian and Indian economic life 
must give way, the reward is something of even greater value to them -- 
continued access to the American market itself. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, the three countries cited for blocking U.S. access to markets 
and the 22 others placed on a "watch list" are not all pleased by the prospect 
of an 18-month time limit in which to negotiate trade opening agreements that 
will forestall the Bush Administration from imposing up to 100% penalty duties 
on their products sold here. 
</P>
<P>
But in fairness, the three nations cited have had it coming to them for a long 
time. Japan has run a classic mercantilist, beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy 
since time began. While South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have all 
opened up (albeit reluctantly) to American trade, Tokyo's negotiators have 
remained resolute. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil has been hiding for years behind the protection of being a Third World 
nation when really it should have graduated to second-world (growing industrial 
economy) status earlier in this decade. Brazil's import-licensing system and 
its protection of industries deemed important for development must be 
liberalized. And India's refusals to honor world patent protections, the 
closing off of its insurance industry and other barriers to trade in services 
and investment also are indefensible for a nation demanding to be treated as a 
full dues-paying adult in all other matters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Signal 
</P>
<P>
The trade complaints have less to do with individual disputes such as Japan's 
refusal to buy California rice or Detroit auto parts. The issue is whether 
these governments routinely tolerate a system of anti-trade practices in their 
private sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the European Community was left off the list was an important 
signal from President Bush of just how prepared he is to negotiate and 
horse-trade guns for butter and vice versa. The U.S. trade team is openly 
worried that the EC will set up "European content" laws on everything from 
computer chips to television programs that will work against the kind of 
joint-venture manufacturing partnerships that we are trying to foster around 
the world. Even so, Bush has decided to avoid provoking a trade policy crisis 
in exchange for loyal support on nuclear arms talks with the Soviets in the 
months to come. 
</P>
<P>
Is that fair to the Japanese and the others cited or put on the watch lists? 
No, but it is sensible diplomacy. And it is a good start for a new American 
Administration. What remains, of course, is the question of whether Bush and 
his senior advisers can carry off this risky plan to break the trade stalemate 
that has dogged us for years.

"If we pray together, maybe we can stay together," El DeBarge earnestly sings 
on one track in a manner that recalls Marvin Gaye's classic "What's Going On." 
The Gaye influence has always been obvious in this singer-songwriter's music, 
and "Gemini" sounds like Gaye-meets-Guy, especially on the aggressively sexy 
"Real Love" and the even more blatantly amorous "Make You Mine." Where there 
once was an element of boyish sweetness to DeBarge's delivery, there's some 
very adult-sounding regret and resolution to his voice on such tracks as "Turn 
the Page" and "Broken Dreams." The religious references on the latter cut may 
be there in order to defuse -- or excuse -- the raw sexuality that appears 
elsewhere on the album. But, of course, it's precisely that type of 
contradiction that always made Gaye such a complex and interesting artist.

Most of this album is as bad as you'd expect -- but not for the reasons you'd 
expect. Osmond has the reputation for being a bland, soulless singer. His 
vocals, however, aren't the main flaw in this collection of rather dreary pop 
songs. The problem is primarily inferior material and thoroughly unimaginative, 
one-dimensional production -- particularly on the up-tempo songs. His Top 5 
pop/dance hit "Soldier of Love" works because of the punchy arrangement -- and 
in spite of his tepid vocals. But, except for a few lapses, his singing is 
generally passable, and on a few ballads even praiseworthy, showing some 
strength and honest feeling. With the right material and production, Osmond 
just might turn out a very good pop album. Dennis Hunt

<P>
Much of the music on Milli Vanilli's debut album is aimed at the club scene, 
the most winning example being the hip-hop disco-pop of the title cut. The 
album feels as though it was rushed to completion to capitalize on the runaway 
success of that sexy smash single, since the rest of the ideas aren't as well 
thought-out. 
</P>
<P>
German producer Frank Farian -- best known for his disco hits with a 
British-based group of West Indians called Boney M. -- does have a flair for 
trendy, Euro-style dance music. But there still isn't much to endorse on the 
L.A. duo's album aside from "Dreams to Remember," with its moody, jazz 
undertones, and "Blame It on the Rain," which carries a faint whiff of '60s 
Memphis soul. The album closes on a "N.Y. Subway Extended Mix" of the title cut 
featuring a clumsily sampled bit of Bobby Brown's "Don't Be Cruel" -- making 
you realize that there is something to be said for leaving well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish duo Roxette (Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson) is bidding for the 
same level of pop stardom as ABBA. They're on their way with their first 
American hit single "The Look," and other cuts on their album -- like the 
driving, energetic "Shadow of a Doubt" and the sultry, emotional "Cry" -- are 
just about as crafty. The problem is that most of "Look Sharp!'s" music is of 
such a light, ephemeral nature that it disappears without a trace the minute 
the record leaves the turntable. Looks like Roxette's forte is pop music that 
is prettily presented but totally disposable. CONNIE JOHNSON

Between the death of Bob Marley, the murder of drummer Carlton Barrett and 
legal entanglements restricting the group's activities for years, the Wailers 
Band has faced plenty of trials by fire. But there's little evidence of the 
reggae sextet's indomitable spirit on this undistinguished comeback album. The 
songs (all written or co-written by singer-guitarist Junior Marvin) steer a 
nondescript commercial course that echoes Steel Pulse and UB40. Only "Reggae 
Love" and "Irie" pack any kind of groove punch, while the lyrics are nebulous 
social protests or generic tributes to reggae music. No one should begrudge the 
Wailers an identity as something more than the official Bob Marley jukebox, but 
the anonymity of the material on "I.D." is pretty shocking -- as is the 
realization that the Wailers, who once defined the direction of reggae, are now 
followers rather than leaders. DON SNOWDEN

FINISH OFF THE COLD WAR: STOP COVERT ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Arthur Macy Cox, Arthur Macy Cox is secretary of the American Committee on 
U.S.-Soviet Relations, a bipartisan, public -policy organization. He was 
formerly a diplomat and a CIA official. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush triumphed at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
summit last week because he jettisoned a sterile Cold War ideology that marked 
the first four months of his Administration and adopted new thinking that can 
lead to genuine disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
The President has moved "beyond containment" in response to evidence that 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has repudiated Soviet policies of expansionism and is 
moving to demilitarize U.S.-Soviet competition. But partial military 
disarmament will not be enough to end the Cold War. While it has been fueled by 
an arms race, it has also been waged by clandestine paramilitary and political 
operations and espionage. Bush should maintain his initiative by proposing 
negotiations to terminate the clandestine war. 
</P>
<P>
After 45 years of profound distrust on both sides, continuing secret operations 
will be a barrier to stable coexistence. Throughout the Cold War, both 
Washington and Moscow used each other's clandestine operations to measure true 
intentions. No matter how much peaceful rhetoric was contained in the speeches 
of superpower leaders, evidence of covert action and espionage was proof of 
continuing aggression. These operations manifestly increase tension. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent news stories are instructive. Over the weekend of May 20, the 
British government expelled 11 Soviets -- eight diplomats and three journalists 
-- as spies. In a typical tit-for-tat response, the Soviets expelled an equal 
number of British diplomats and journalists from Moscow. Gorbachev's "new 
thinking" has not yet changed the habits of the KGB. This event soured 
British-Soviet relations. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an early supporter 
of Gorbachev's programs, said the continuing espionage revealed "that many 
things remain the same. I'm disappointed . . . they have revealed their true 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
The other concerns John Le Carre, the former British secret agent, who has 
written some of the best Cold War spy novels. His latest book, "The Russia 
House," will be published in the Soviet Union. The book focuses on how 
intelligence services, both East and West, block attempts, on both sides, to 
end the Cold War. Le Carre says that spies will find new ways to keep anyone 
from doing them out of their jobs by launching new espionage plots. All of this 
resonates with the spy ousters in London and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year record of clandestine operations, on both sides, is not impressive. 
In fact, those operations have often caused serious setbacks to the security of 
both superpowers. The Soviets were thrown out of Yugoslavia, Egypt, Ghana and 
Guinea -- in large measure because KGB operations attempting to overthrow the 
indigenous regimes were publicly exposed. With Egypt, the Soviets lost a 
strategic Middle East base when the head of Egyptian intelligence was revealed 
to be a KGB agent planning a coup to replace Anwar Sadat. The United States, 
too, has sponsored numerous failed secret operations with disastrous 
consequences, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the Iran-Contra 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Even the so-called covert successes have, in time, often produced horrendous 
negative repercussions. For example, in the period from 1969 to 1971, the most 
important Soviet foreign-policy negotiation was with Chancellor Willy Brandt of 
West Germany. It resulted in the recognition of East Germany. This agreement 
did more to reduce the risk of war than any diplomacy since the end of World 
War II. Shortly after, however, the West Germans discovered that an East German 
spy, directed by the KGB, had long been employed in Brandt's offices. Brandt 
was compromised and he resigned -- much to the embarrassment of the Soviet 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, when Chinese and Soviet forces engaged in border clashes, the Soviets 
demanded that the Chinese negotiate. They refused. So the KGB launched a covert 
operation, spreading rumors that the Soviets were about to launch a preemptive 
strike to eliminate Chinese nuclear capability. The Chinese were intimidated, 
and agreed to talk, but also began "Ping-Pong" diplomacy. In 1971, Henry A. 
Kissinger made his secret trip to Beijing and soon President Richard M. Nixon 
arrived to sign the agreement re-establishing relations between the United 
States and China. Thus, a successful Soviet covert operation paved the way to 
U.S.-Chinese rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
A covert operation claimed as one of CIA's greatest successes was the overthrow 
of President Mohammed Mossadeq of Iran and restoration of the shah in 1953. 
Mossadeq had been popular; the shah was not. His power came from secret police, 
the military and U.S. assistance. The ensuing revolution brought with it 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's religious fundamentalism. This unfortunate turn 
of events for the United States was rooted in a so-called successful CIA 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of the Cold War, covert operations were marginal at best; 
today, they have become an anachronism. Gorbachev and his associates are 
determined to dismantle Stalinism. They have rejected the goal of worldwide 
communist states run from Moscow. They want to disarm by more than 50% and they 
want to demilitarize competition with the West. They urge a ban on direct or 
indirect military intervention in Third World disputes, including the use of 
covert paramilitary forces. Thus, Gorbachev's policies are removing the 
rationale for clandestine warfare. When it becomes clear that both sides have 
given up the goal of winning the Cold War, it will be apparent that new 
clandestine operations are counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
The process may have begun. Earlier this year, Jack Matlock, U.S. ambassador to 
the Soviet Union, was invited to an unprecedented private meeting with KGB 
Chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov. A recent unofficial joint study prepared by 
U.S. and Soviet experts dealt with measures to end the Cold War. The Soviet 
delegation noted that essential trust between the powers will not be possible 
until espionage and covert operations have ended. The Soviets observed that as 
long as there was a danger of war, every method of obtaining reliable 
information was used -- but they noted that an important means to replace 
espionage will be on-site inspection. In the past, the Soviet Union opposed 
on-site inspection, fearing U.S. espionage. They have reversed that position by 
accepting comprehensive provisions for verification. 
</P>
<P>
After pressing the Soviet Union to accept on-site inspection for more than 30 
years, some U.S. leaders are now expressing hesitancy. CIA Director William H. 
Webster recently observed that the comprehensive verification procedures 
proposed by the Soviet Union "could be difficult if not dangerous." Of course 
they will be difficult, but if the Soviet Union is willing to open its defense 
industry to U.S. inspection, it would be unconscionable for the United States 
not to reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
Espionage may be the second-oldest profession, but it is also a hostile act. 
Furthermore, it is no longer necessary. A combination of disarmament agreements 
verified by on-site inspection and technological intelligence will provide 
better security than at any time during the Cold War. Through the precision 
cameras of space reconnaissance, the United States has photographed the entire 
Soviet Union in minute detail. This information, when combined with electronic 
interception, radar, code-breaking and computers, provides excellent 
intelligence about Soviet military capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is time to launch the negotiations to end the clandestine war. High 
priorities should be given to removing intelligence personnel from embassy 
staffs and U.N. delegations. Spy masters, operating under diplomatic cover, 
have been a major source of distrust and an impediment to diplomacy. The 
phasing-out of clandestine operations is difficult but essential, in order to 
proceed simultaneously with political and disarmament negotiations.

CHALLENGING THE MYTHS OF GERMANY'S THIRD REICH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Half a century ago, after six years in power, Adolf Hitler looked invincible. 
He ordered his generals to prepare for the invasion of Poland, in the 
blitzkrieg that precipitated World War II. An oral history, "Voices From the 
Third Reich," to be published this month by Regnery Gateway Inc., examines what 
it was like to watch and participate in the rise of Hitler from many points of 
view -- concentration camp victims, SS men, resistance activists, teen-age 
Nazis, emigres. The following is adapted from the book's epilogue: 
</P>
<P>
The Third Reich changed the history of the world, yet it endured for only a 
brief moment in time -- 12 years. The years of Nazi rule left Germany's cities 
destroyed, its people scattered, its government abolished. Foreign soldiers 
walked its streets as masters while millions of refugees sought safety from an 
Eastern Europe staging its own solution of the German question by systematic, 
brutal expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
What had become of the cheering crowds of 1933? Of 1938? Were the wartime 
Germans a generation of opportunists, rejecting the Nazi order only when the 
bill came due? This question is particularly significant because of the nature 
of the National Socialist regime. It was not a state like all the rest, a state 
which made its bid for world power, fought a war and lost. It was a criminal 
system that committed its atrocities "in the name of the German people." 
</P>
<P>
But questions of right and wrong are seldom as obvious at the time as they seem 
in retrospect, even under Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of events was rapid enough to sweep along millions of people with a 
current that seemed to flow ever faster. Modern states and modern ideologies 
have the means to blur processes of choice and action. Particularly for young 
people, there was no time to reflect, no refuge from the endless pressure to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
World War II had no parallel in history. It was waged without rules or mercy. 
It assumed a life of its own, as though it would go on forever. Yet at the same 
time it was waged with malevolent intelligence. No one in Europe escaped it. 
World War II mobilized children for the front. It made women the prizes of 
victory. It demanded the annihilation of entire peoples. It generated realities 
worse than any nightmare. Auschwitz, Stalingrad, and Berlin have in common that 
the abnormal became the stuff of everyday life. Chaos seemed natural. It was 
the way things had always been, the way things always would be. 
</P>
<P>
Clear thought was further discouraged by ignorance based on lack of 
information. Books, newspapers, radio, all were rigidly controlled. Even 
private conversations involved significant risk. Soldiers, whether at the front 
or in home garrisons, were in an even more restricted environment than 
civilians. Thousands of men in Werhmacht uniforms were executed or imprisoned 
for "damaging the national war effort" by "crimes" as insignificant as 
listening to foreign radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
If guessing was risky, knowing too much posed more than simple physical danger. 
Those who by chance glanced into the Nazi abyss promptly looked away. They 
denied it existed. They talked of "exceptions" or "excesses." They forced 
themselves to forget. Anything was preferable to the truth, because the truth 
was too horrible to acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The men and women who share their lives in "Voices From the Third Reich" 
challenge three familiar myths about Germans under National Socialism. The 
first is the myth of collective opposition, the myth that the German people 
from the beginning rejected Hitler's siren call. The myth makes everyone at 
heart a Christian, a Marxist, a simple soldier or something else having as 
little as possible to do with National Socialism. Susanne Ritters, 17 at war's 
end, offers a bitter critique: 
</P>
<P>
"We believed in Hitler. We believed in the whole system, the entire leadership. 
There we were, already half-dead, still believing in victory. We could not do 
anything else. That was our generation and he was our idol. We didn't just 
adopt something. It was a given. It came from inside of us. And we sucked it in 
like mother's milk." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is also denial of an opposing myth, the myth of collective guilt that 
makes every German living through this period an active, committed Nazi, 
endorsing when not supporting every aspect of the regime. Richard Lowenthal, 
forced into exile as a Jew and a Social Democrat, says he was "very much aware 
that anti-Semitism had always existed in Germany, but before Hitler's time it 
was confined to a very small minority. If I were to compare Germany with other 
countries before Hitler, I could say that there was considerably less 
anti-Semitism in Germany than in France, to say nothing of Poland or Austria. 
</P>
<P>
"What many people fail to realize is that Hitler did not come to power because 
of his anti-Semitism . . . . Hitler's coming to power was based on a wave of 
nationalism and the miserable economic situation in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
What attracted millions of Germans were National Socialism's positive appeals. 
Family, community, homeland -- these values are not contemptible in themselves, 
nor were they invented by the Nazis. Hitler spoke to a desire to have things 
better. He even delivered -- at least for a while -- long enough to add the 
German people to his list of victims. 
</P>
<P>
Our interview partners finally challenge a third myth -- the myth of oblivion, 
sometimes described as "Waldheimer's Disease": Live long enough and you forget 
you were ever a Nazi. German history neither began nor ended in 1945. The 
Federal Republic sometimes speaks of a "Zero Hour" from which all somehow began 
anew. East Germany boasts of a postwar revolution which swept away the old 
order. But the generation that bore the burden of Hitler's war remembers, far 
too well for its own comfort, the part it played. 
</P>
<P>
For the survivors, their war was not a collective experience. It was a 
composite of personal events and decisions, random happenings and blind chance 
against a background of confusion. They have struggled -- not least by 
participating in this project -- to come to terms with their country's history 
on a personal level. If recollection sometimes finds positive elements -- 
courage, comradeship, empathy -- that should occasion neither alarm nor 
surprise. Such memories are not harbingers of a Fourth Reich. They are rather 
part of the process of mastering a painful past. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1945, Western thought has been permeated by a utopianism leaving no room 
for misjudgment, no room for immaturity, no room for conversion. What is 
important is being right, morally right, the first time and from the first 
hour. In both Germanys younger generations say, "It would never have happened 
to us." They declare themselves too clever, too sophisticated, to have become 
part of Hitler's Reich. Our interview partners' experiences suggest another 
important lesson: the potential to learn from error, to learn from history, 
which remains a record of mistakes made for good reasons. They have been taught 
humility, and have paid high prices for the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Greater Germany" died with Hitler. But "Germany" remains a living concept on 
both sides of the current border. The emphasis may differ, but the roots are 
the same: two states, but one ethnic and cultural entity, one nation. The war 
generation built this new Germany as it had fought for the old one. After the 
war, this generation had to ask itself: What is more important, yesterday or 
tomorrow? Its answer can be seen by any visitor. Civilization owes these men 
and women, if not gratitude, then at least recognition.

WASTING THE WORLD WITH A PLAGUE OF PLASTIC DEBRIS 
</P>

The world of plastics is in a mess these days because it has made a mess. 
Polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and all the other polys pile up 
-- on roadsides, in the ocean and in landfills. They are likely to last several 
hundred years, after serving us sometimes only for a few hours or weeks -- if 
indeed they could be said to serve at all. The primary role of many plastics is 
to catch attention in a store, where they are garishly shaped and colored with, 
among other things, toxic heavy metals. Environmentalists say the dumps fill up 
not with packaging, but with marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Until we noticed dumps filling, most of us never thought about streams of 
plastics flowing through our lives -- 18 million tons each year, including 6.5 
million tons of packaging and more than $3 billion dollars' worth of plastic 
garbage bags in which to throw the other plastics out. Now we approach panic. 
Pending in state legislatures are 66 proposed bans on non-biodegradable 
packaging; 12 packaging taxes; 74 source separation and recycling mandates, and 
19 requirements that state governments purchase recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
It's not fair to blame plastics for our trash problem, says the industry. 
Plastics make up only 4% to 7% of municipal solid waste (by weight; by volume 
it's more like 20% to 30%). But plastics are the focus of most legislation, 
perhaps because they are the fastest growing constituent of trash, or because 
they are used for so many trivial purposes, or because they are so nearly 
immortal. 
</P>
<P>
Immortality is one quality that makes plastics useful, of course. They are 
impervious to bacteria, acid, salt, rust, breakage, almost any agent except 
heat -- and some of them can even stand up to heat. If they didn't junk up our 
lives so, we would regard them as miracle substances -- long, long hydrocarbon 
chains, crafted to take on almost any properties we want. Plastics can be 
transparent or opaque, hard as steel or pliant as silk, squeezable or rigid, 
moldable into any conceivable shape. 
</P>
<P>
And, environmentalists would say, they are made from depleting supplies of oil 
and gas, wrested from the ends of the earth, synthesized in energy-consuming, 
hazardous-waste-generating processes and disposed of carelessly. Messy, from 
beginning to end. If we were properly charged for the full human and 
environmental costs of plastics, we would not eliminate them -- they are far 
too useful for that -- but we would treat those specialized molecules with the 
respect they deserve. We would not use them for a few days or hours and throw 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
The standard environmentalist formula for dealing with precious but polluting 
materials is simple: Reduce, reuse, recycle, in that order, and then, as a last 
resort, dispose with care. Of course the plastics industry makes money in 
inverse order. It is looking for a way to keep us buying millions of tons of 
plastics each year -- and to have them miraculously disappear when we throw 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore industry's favorite answers to the plastics problem are two: 
incineration and degradation. 
</P>
<P>
As a descendant of petroleum, plastic burns beautifully. Like all hydrocarbons, 
it combusts into carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, plus a host of other 
pollutants. Some of them derive from additives such as heavy metals (which end 
up either in air emissions or incinerator ash). Others, like toxic dioxins and 
furans, come from high-temperature reactions between hydrocarbons and chlorine. 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) releases so much hydrochloric acid as it burns that it 
corrodes the incinerator. For that reason one incinerator manufacturer 
recommends keeping PVC out of incinerated trash. 
</P>
<P>
Incineration can recapture a small fraction of the energy and effort put into 
making plastics. Degradation doesn't even do that. 
</P>
<P>
Degradable plastics come in two forms: biodegradable and photodegradable. The 
biodegradable kind mixes the long plastic molecules, which nothing in nature 
can digest, with starch; microorganisms will happily munch away on starch. 
</P>
<P>
On the side of the road a bottle or bag made of biodegradable plastic slowly 
falls apart -- into tiny shards of undegradable plastic. The bottle or bag 
disintegrates, but the plastic is still there. Presumably it is inert and 
harmless, but no one really knows the implications of a world filled with 
plastic sand. 
</P>
<P>
In a landfill, biodegradation happens very slowly, if at all. Nothing degrades 
well in a landfill. William Rathje, a University of Arizona anthropologist, 
drills core samples from old landfills and finds intact food, paper, cloth -- 
20 years old. He can date the layers exactly, because he can read the 
newspapers. Landfills are not compost heaps. They haven't the proper air 
circulation, moisture content, mixture of nutrients or communities of 
microorganisms to encourage natural breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of photo- and biodegradable plastics admit, when pressed, that 
neither can extend the lives of landfills. They only help with the problem of 
litter. They are designer molecules to do away with the ugly evidence of our 
unwillingness to pick up after ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling at least slows the waste stream and lets the plastics serve several 
times before discard. Only about 2% of the plastics we use are now recycled (as 
opposed to 29% of aluminum, 21% of paper), but that's not because it can't be 
done. Plastics are the easiest of all materials to recycle. Basically they just 
need to be shredded, remelted -- usually at low temperatures -- and reformed. 
The industry itself grinds and reuses 5 billion pounds of plastic scrap a year. 
</P>
<P>
Two things are in the way of serious plastics recycling -- separation and 
purification. Consumers can put paper and cans in separate waste containers 
with relative ease, but they can't tell the difference between polypropylene 
and polystyrene. Bottlers have set up a voluntary coding system, to be phased 
in over the next three years, identifying resin types on containers. But that 
does not help separate myriad other forms of plastics, including squeezable 
bottles with several kinds laminated together. (In a true recycling society 
such unseparable mixed-material containers would be banned.) 
</P>
<P>
Some separation is easy, though. Recycling centers now collect tons of 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) milk bottles and polyethylene teraphthalate 
(PET) soda bottles. They are not, unfortunately, made back into milk and soda 
bottles, because of the problem of purification. One person in a thousand might 
have used a bottle to hold roach poison or kerosene before throwing it away, 
and contaminants could have permeated the plastic -- to come out later into the 
milk or soda. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore recycled plastics are not used to package edibles. Reclaimed HDPE and 
PET are made into carpet fibers, cushion stuffing, car stops and scouring pads. 
Mixed plastics are made into lumber-like poles, posts, stakes and slats, for 
never-rotting barns, docks, fences, road markers, pilings. These processes are 
better than nothing, but they are not real recycling. They will screech to a 
halt when we all have as many immortal cushions and car stops as we need. The 
only recycling processes that can work in the long run are those that return 
materials to their same use -- soda bottles to soda bottles, milk containers to 
milk containers. 
</P>
<P>
At least one entrepreneur claims to be able to purify recycled PET and to make 
it back into risk-free soda bottles. Wizards in the petrochemical industry are 
clever; they can handle any problem if its solution involves manipulating 
molecules and promises profits. 
</P>
<P>
Reuse is preferable to recycling, because it takes less energy and causes less 
pollution to wash out a polystyrene coffee cup, say, and refill it, than it 
does to crush it, melt it and reform it. Because of the contamination problem, 
most plastic containers cannot be reused commercially. They can be reused 
domestically, however, since you know whether you've put roach poison in a 
bottle or not. If you haven't, you can reuse it, many times over. A real 
environmentalist would never fill a plastic foam hot cup with coffee only once. 
</P>
<P>
But then a real environmentalist wouldn't drink from a plastic foam hot cup. He 
or she would remember that the world once worked fairly smoothly with washable 
china. Recycling is better than disposal, reuse is better than recycling, but 
reduction is best of all. It's easier to deal with a flood by turning it off at 
its source than by inventing better mopping technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Such solutions, reduction solutions that distinguish the plastics we need from 
those we don't, will not come from industry. They will come through the 
political process and through the market, as we finally charge ourselves, one 
way or another, the real cost of producing and disposing of plastics.

COMING HOME TO FIND A SMUG, SCARED AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stanley Meisler, Stanley Meisler, now based in Washington, was The Times' 
correspondent in Paris from 1983 to 1988.

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can hear the moments of boredom tick away whenever you tell Americans that 
no other industrialized democracy has the same dispiriting problems as the 
United States -- not the crime, not the guns, not the homeless, not the 
unschooled, not the poor, not the racism, not the ugliness. Listeners may mimic 
interest for a short while, then their glances roll up and away. 
</P>
<P>
They may not doubt me but, content in smugness, they do not care. After 21 
years as a foreign correspondent, I returned home late last year to a country 
bristling with astonishing problems, most left untended. Yet many Americans 
persist in believing that their country has a divine mission on Earth, a model 
for all others. 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance about the rest of the world seems total. Our son set off for high 
school the other day in a T-shirt emblazoned with a bust of Lenin. I jokingly 
warned him to be careful. "Don't worry," he said, cynically not jovially, "no 
one at school knows who he is." 
</P>
<P>
Few if any peoples can boast as much democracy and energy as Americans. These 
are wondrous gifts that foreigners can hardly fathom. Yet I often wonder now to 
what purposes they are put. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of crime quickly makes a returning American feel the reality of home. On 
one winter night I walked across five dim, deserted Washington blocks wondering 
whether it might have been wiser to take a cab. There is no such fear in most 
cities of Western Europe and Canada. Almost all of downtown Paris, for example, 
bustles with carefree revelers at all hours before dawn. Crime does exist but 
if Los Angeles had the homicide rate of Paris it might consider disbanding its 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, of course, are not oblivious to crime -- they fume about it -- but 
they do seem oblivious to the problems of poverty, education, unemployment, 
racism and inequality that spawn this crime. Instead, there are ever more cries 
for vengeance and ever more demands for Draconian punishment. These cries come 
even though the United States already keeps a higher percentage of its 
population in jail than any countries other than South Africa and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Although many countries fret over drug addiction, it is basically, as a Yale 
historian once put it, "an American disease." The problem exists nowhere else 
in such intensity. Perhaps because the problem is smaller, Britain can look on 
addicts with humanity, treating them like sick people. The British have trouble 
understanding why Americans treat addicts as satanic enemies in a war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent symposium in Washington, Allan Parry, head of a Liverpool drug 
program, could not hide his fury at American attitudes toward addicts and the 
refusal of almost all American cities to hand out clean needles as a way of 
preventing the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very sad to see the people in the Bronx using the same needle and 
being criminalized and brutalized," he said, words steeled in anger. "We used 
to send people to the United States to see how to do things. Now, people go to 
New York to see how not to run things. 'Let them die.' The number of times I've 
heard that in this country. 'Let them die.' It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
I took his words down, having occasionally felt the same kind of anger back 
home in America. The first images that struck me on my return, however, 
provoked only a troubling puzzlement. I saw an abundance that would astound the 
rest of the world and then an ugliness that might astound them just as much. 
</P>
<P>
The cornucopia on a U.S. supermarket shelf, for example, numbs the sense of 
choice. A shopper searching for salad dressing must now choose among French, 
honey French, Italian, creamy Italian, zesty Italian, robust Italian, blue 
cheese, thousand island, Caesar, sweet &amp; sour, ranch, buttermilk &amp; 
herbs, celery seed &amp; onion, dill &amp; lemon and more. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 11 brands of dog food. Even bagels come in a host of 
flavors: garlic, onion, rye, pumpernickel, honey wheat, bran, sesame, poppy, 
cinnamon raisin -- and plain. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this dazzling display of abundance comes in enormities of shopping malls 
that proliferate around cities like pillboxes on guard against style and 
beauty. Such clusters of concrete existed two decades ago but never in such 
size and strength. They symbolize the sprawl and flight that make spiritless 
U.S. cities so different now from the vibrant, lovely towns of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
No memory prepared me for the awfulness of American television commercials -- 
almost every message loud, every scene frenzied. Any touch of subtlety vanishes 
with constant repetition. Only a masochist would sit through them with any 
pleasure, the way most people watch commercials in Paris. Sophisticates regard 
commercials in France as works of art; the best-known French movie directors 
make them. 
</P>
<P>
No memory prepared me for the mindlessness of the 1988 presidential campaign. I 
had just covered the French presidential elections where the televised debate 
was sharp and meaningful, campaign speeches long and thoughtful, differences 
between candidates clear and philosophical. France allows no political spots on 
television. Campaign managers do not mold strategy around sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, French analysts kept moaning about the "Americanization" of their 
elections, meaning a decline of substance in favor of image. But a few weeks 
into the American campaign, it was clear that the French need not have worried; 
they were far, far behind the American model. 
</P>
<P>
Television has created a vacuousness in American public life. Soon after 
arrival in Washington, I was entangled in several misunderstandings. While I 
thought I was arranging lengthy interviews with officials, they assumed I was 
setting up quick phone calls to catch pithy quotes. Television had instilled 
the idea that reporters needed no more than 15-second bites. 
</P>
<P>
"You are an anachronism in American journalism," said Marvin Kalb over dinner 
in Cambridge one night. The director of Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Barone 
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy explained, "You actually want 
to interview somebody." 
</P>
<P>
I have felt anguish about the irrefutable evidence of deterioration in America: 
Surveys rank U.S. schoolchildren at the bottom in math when tested against 
South Koreans, Canadians, Spaniards, Britons and Irish. Studies show the United 
States now has the 18th-worst infant-mortality rate in the world. Such reports 
make me feel I have returned to an America that feels good about tinsel and 
helpless before the scourges that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Experience overseas taught me that no other people have the same control over 
their destiny as Americans. American democracy allows the people more rights 
than any other political system and more input -- either through the power of 
public opinion or Congress -- into government. In no other country could a 
legislature have denied a leader the choice of a secretary of defense the way 
the Senate rejected President Bush's nomination of John G. Tower. In no other 
country could a peaceful expression of public opinion have denied Congress a 
pay raise the way it was denied here earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the despairing problems of America are neglected because Americans do not 
feel the need to face them. Bribed by tax cuts and soothed by Reagan years 
reassurances, they feel no urgency, content to accept the argument that "budget 
restraints" make it impossible to do anything -- at least now. The fact that 
Western Europe and Canada manage these problems by imposing higher taxes and 
spending government funds heavily does not seem to impress anyone, if they even 
know about it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the problem is leadership. Leaders of most industrial democracies have 
a breadth of intellect and experience, a moral strength and commitment to 
reason that often seems lacking here. Perhaps the very power of our people 
undercuts leadership. U.S. leaders have to cater to the tastes and whims of the 
masses in ways that leaders in countries like France and Britain do not. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in leadership are hard to explain. Since returning, only one 
American politician has truly impressed me -- Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.). He breakfasted with reporters one morning and replied to all 
questions with impeccable logic, pertinent evidence, thoughtful analysis and 
reasonable conclusions. I had not heard that quality of political discourse 
since leaving Paris. 
</P>
<P>
After the breakfast, I excitedly told everyone that Mitchell sounded just like 
a French politician. I meant it as a compliment; everyone else assumed I was 
putting him down.

'RESTORE THE PUBLIC TRUST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have grown weary of proposals such as that suggested in your editorial, which 
advocate raising the salaries of public officials as a method of reducing the 
amount of political corruption plaguing this nation. Rather than placing the 
responsibility for their behavior squarely on the persons who engage in 
unethical or illegal activities, this solution instead implies that "the poor 
politicians can't help themselves" and blames the citizenry by stating in 
effect that voters get what they pay for. 
</P>
<P>
People whose integrity does not fluctuate in relation to their salaries should 
find such implications not only offensive, but alarming. Is it so irrational to 
expect elected officials to exercise sound moral judgment simply because it is 
the correct thing to do? Even if salaries were increased to a level which would 
enable public officials "to maintain a reasonable standard of living," 
certainly such salaries will never satiate the greed of those politicians for 
whom money and power are more important than their constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
What a shame that all around us, in local, state and national politics, we are 
witnessing the results of a political ethic based on self-interest rather than 
on service to others.

How much do junk mail and flyer ads contribute to the 1.5 tons of trash that

Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's university-age daughter, Mary, was refused a 
summer job at Yellowstone National Park (Part I, May 24). She was not 
"qualified" for the job, according to the notice from the park to her mother, 
Lynne. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving this notice, Lynne Cheney called park Supt. Robert Barbee. 
After the call, park officials took another look at Mary's application.

Guess What! Mary was then hired for the same job for which her application had 
been refused because of her lack of qualification.

A little influence certainly helps.

Our so-called representative government is in very sad shape indeed. A short 
list includes (former Atty. Gen. Edwin) Meese, (House Speaker Jim) Wright, (Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom) Bradley, (House Whip Tony) Coelho, (state Sen. Joseph) 
Montoya, and on and on, ad nauseam. It is sickening to see these guys running 
for cover with that Cheshire cat grin on their faces; all the while mumbling 
some variation of the infamous phrase, "I am not a crook!" 
</P>
<P>
Great merciful heavens! Don't these highbinders realize that the question is 
not one of breaking the law? The average Joe Citizen assumes his elected 
representatives are law abiding. What we are talking about here is unethical 
and amoral conduct, about cronyism, about cupidity, yes, about "sleaze." To the 
average man these things are more important than the law. 
</P>
<P>
When the historians of the next century try to make some sense out of this 
period they will stumble badly over the question, "Why did this freedom-loving 
people spend their hard-earned dollars on policeman to eradicate prostitution, 
and then elect whores to public office?" Maybe we should try and answer the 
question ourselves!

By CHRISTOPHER B. LEINBERGER, Christopher B. Leinberger is managing partner of 
Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co., a Beverly Hills urban development advisory 
firm. He is co-author of a 1988 Atlantic Monthly article Los Angeles Comes of 
Age.

<TEXT>
<P>
Branch libraries are curtailing hours. Parks are not being maintained. There is 
less and less federal money for cities. Nearly every day we read about the 
growing need and diminished resources of our local governments. Hamstrung by 
Proposition 13 limitations, large and small cities are in a race like never 
before to increase their tax base without raising residential taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the same time, there has been an economic transformation in the 
five-county Greater Los Angeles area. This shift in the region's economy from 
one big city surrounded by bedroom communities to a collection of economically 
strong areas has increased certain cities' commercial and industrial tax base. 
The continuation of this change will allow other local communities, if they 
want this new commercial and industrial tax base, to become centers of future 
development. However, they must first recognize the opportunity and take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the Industrial Revolution changed our 18th-Century agricultural 
trading towns into 19th-Century industrial cities have our urbanized areas been 
more dramatically transformed than of late. As our economy moves into the 
"post-industrial" era, our former industrial cities are being transformed into 
decentralized metropolitan areas. These greatly enlarged metropolitan areas 
occupy 10 to 20 times the land area of their industrial ancestors. As a result 
of this decentralizing transformation, there are many downtowns -- 
concentrations of employment, shopping, culture, and decision-making -- not 
just one. 
</P>
<P>
The Greater Los Angeles area now has 25 downtowns, with downtown Los Angeles 
just first among equals. And in the future, downtown Los Angeles may not even 
be first. Consider office space. In 1960, downtown Los Angeles had 60% of all 
office space in Southern California.Today, it has 14% and it is absorbing only 
9% of the annual new space, so it will continue to shrink relatively. This is 
in spite of the fact that downtown has been completely rebuilt in the last 20 
years and is now impressive enough to appear on our television screens every 
Thursday night on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Where are the major new office concentrations emerging? Look at Warner Center, 
Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, downtown Long 
Beach, and all of the emerging downtowns of Orange County, including Huntington 
Beach, Fullerton, Anaheim, South County, and the Newport Beach/Costa 
Mesa/Irvine complex. In fact, Newport Beach/Costa Mesa/Irvine is the 
second-largest downtown in Southern California and is the fastest-growing 
office-dominated employment center. It is growing 50% faster than downtown Los 
Angeles and will be larger than downtown Los Angeles sometime in the 1990s. 
From a shopping perspective, this area is already the largest. Just one of 
Newport Beach/Costa Mesa/Irvine's shopping centers, South Coast Plaza, has more 
sales than all of Beverly Hills. The benefit of South Coast Plaza to the city 
of Costa Mesa is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The issues of air pollution, traffic congestion and achieving a higher level of 
jobs and housing are being battled at the regional levels among the Air Quality 
Management District, the Southern California Assn. of Governments and the 
various counties and cities. An equally dramatic jockeying for power is taking 
shape among the region's smaller cities as they compete for new tax-producing 
commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this shift from one downtown to 25 of interest to the average citizen? 
For one thing, it will affect everyone's housing or employment decision. In 
1960, the average commute in Southern California was about 30 minutes. In the 
1970s, after nearly 4 million more people moved to the Greater Los Angeles 
area, the average commute was still about 30 minutes. People moved closer to 
their employment and their employment moved closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1980s, the average commute time has been increasing due to 
constraints on freeway capacity and economic limits on affordable housing in 
new major employment centers, especially West Los Angeles and Orange County. To 
alleviate traffic congestion, even more people need to live closer to their 
work or work closer to their homes -- which decentralized downtowns encourage. 
</P>
<P>
While decentralized downtowns are positive if you can live near where you work, 
there are major short- and medium-term problems caused by this trend. For one, 
these downtowns have sprung up very rapidly. In the absence of good planning, 
the result has been poor urban design, inadequate public services and traffic 
congestion. In addition, the character of these new downtowns is generally 
sterile. But both the planning and quality-of-life issues will be resolved if 
the public and private sector commit to solving them. 
</P>
<P>
There is no law of nature dictating precisely where a new downtown will be, so 
there is a lot that local officials can do to bring one or a portion of one to 
their city. Developing master plans for concentrated use of both office and 
industrial development, for instance, can be a step in the right direction. 
Then, if those developments are mixed in with housing, hotels, shopping centers 
and cultural and government buildings, all the elements of a thriving downtown 
would be in place -- but a lot closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
As the Greater Los Angeles area continues to reorganize itself to deal with 
traffic, pollution, housing shortages and other problems, suburban officials 
need to recognize that the region also offers development opportunities that 
can help mitigate these problems -- and put some dollars in the municipal 
coffers.

ALICE KAHN: GOING TO BAT FOR THE GIRLS OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I know the score, but I don't play the game." I once actually uttered these 
words to a boy when I was 14 years old. He was trying to get to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Metaphor was as close to baseball as I ever got. Things were different in the 
bad old days when I was growing up. Nice girls didn't let a boy score, and they 
also didn't play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It's another world for my daughters. One is a teen-ager who is a devoted fan. 
She not only knows the score of every game, she knows the players' stats. Once 
I feared that she would hang out in her room with posters of Jon Bon Jovi and 
other vain dementos. Instead, she started putting up posters of 
wholesome-looking bat swingers. 
</P>
<P>
And my younger daughter is actually playing baseball. "It's called softball, 
Mom," she says, as if I know nothing about anything. But come on. They swing 
bats, they own mitts, they run bases. And furthermore, they have two practices 
a week -- or, as I like to call them, rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a girls' softball league, there are certain modifications. The 
games last five innings or 1 1/2 hours -- whichever comes first. An inning 
lasts three outs or 10 batters -- whichever comes first. Usually it's 10 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the modifications seem geared to protect the girls emotionally. 
Recently, when I showed up in the middle of a game, I asked the adults keeping 
score what the score was. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to tell the score in the middle of the game," the parenting 
person said. "When we did that last time, some of the girls got upset. We don't 
want them to feel competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Since it's hard to win when you don't feel competitive, my daughter's Yen Ching 
team (named after the sponsoring Chinese restaurant) is 1 and 8 so far this 
year. You would think that might be discouraging, but spirit was high at Yen 
Ching's recent apres-game pizza party. Yen Ching had just lost 17-15 to the 
Nelson &amp; Meyer Band. (It's named after the sponsoring orthodontists, Drs. 
Nelson and Meyer.) 
</P>
<P>
The local Round Table Pizza will send a guy to videotape your game if you will 
then come and eat their pizza and drink their root beer while you watch it on 
their big TV. The Yen Chingers certainly sounded competitive as they booed the 
other team on the large screen and then went nuts as they replayed the precious 
moments of success in their earlier loss. Fifteen runs are nothing to sneeze 
at, although they have lost games with 25 runs. It says a lot about defense. 
</P>
<P>
It's been an uphill climb for Yen Ching. The team is composed largely of 
first-time players. My daughter, Hannah, a veteran of three seasons, is in her 
last year of the 8- to 10-year-olds' league. Next year she moves up to the 
older girls' division, where they actually get to pitch instead of using a 
machine or having Jerry or Barry or Robin (the coaches) do it. 
</P>
<P>
I thought Hannah would hate playing on a team with so many novices. Even though 
her previous teams -- Black Oak Books and the Mallard Plumbing Ducks -- had 
significantly more wins, Hannah said that "Yen Ching is the best team I've ever 
played on." 
</P>
<P>
"Why is that?" I asked her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we're all friends and we all like each other," she said of the Yen 
Ching team. Most of them are girls she had never met before spring training. 
</P>
<P>
As I drove Hannah and teammate Elizabeth home from the pizza party, they talked 
animatedly about the game. About the snotty girls on the other team. About how 
Yen Ching has the most spirit. "I just hate it when my dad and Jerry and Barry 
are all yelling at me what to do at the same time," Elizabeth said. "I just 
listen to my dad." 
</P>
<P>
It may not be a winning strategy, but it's a wise one. This spring, these girls 
of summer are getting a taste of the irrelevance of defeat. They don't know the 
score. But they still play the game for all it's worth.

ERMA BOMBECK: WOMAN'S BEST FRIEND SURELY IS NOT HER CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how close we come to egalitarianism, men will always bring up the 
strained relationship between a woman and her car. The old stereotype of a 
woman putting her hand out of the car window to dry her nails instead of making 
a signal to turn will haunt us to our graves. 
</P>
<P>
A group of men were talking recently when one told the story about his wife, 
Anna, who duly reported to him that her brakes were "mushy." He drove her car 
around the block and pronounced the brakes to be perfectly normal. Anna still 
was not convinced. She told her friend, Ethel, that her brakes were "mushy," 
and Ethel said she had the same experience with mushy brakes until she put 
high-test ethyl in the gas tank. The men got hernias from laughing. 
</P>
<P>
I find that story perfectly reasonable. In fact, it all sounds too familiar. I 
had a "ping" in my engine a while back and told my husband about it. He gave me 
that look -- you know the one I mean, like he's standing over a puppy who just 
missed the paper. Then he said, "I'll check it out." 
</P>
<P>
When he came in, he said: "The ping is not under your hood. It's your seat belt 
flapping against the seat." 
</P>
<P>
"You weren't listening," I said. "A ping is never in the car. A ping is always 
under the hood! I know a seat belt when I hear one, and it's not a ping. A 
flapping seat belt is a blump." 
</P>
<P>
"Just drive it around for a while," he said tiredly. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh sure, and just let the ping turn into a major gekump?" 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have to remind you," he asked, "what happened when you took the car in 
for a . . . what was it you called the noise in the trunk?" 
</P>
<P>
"A boompt." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever. We paid $102 to find out that a can of creamed corn was banging 
against your spare tire." 
</P>
<P>
I guess what really ticks me off is the superiority men exude about cars. Don't 
tell me the male species is born knowing about transmissions and brake fluids. 
Anyone who believes a man has an affinity for things mechanical has never 
ridden down a highway in a rental car with a husband who turns on the 
windshield wipers when he has to turn left and releases the hood when he thinks 
he's turning on the lights. 
</P>
<P>
I'll concede that women may not have the right terminology, but we recognize a 
boompt or a mushy when we hear one. And let's face it, men still come running 
to women when the only way they can get the sticker price off the window is to 
break the glass. 
</P>
<P>
About the ping under the hood? All I know is it went away right after I had my 
car washed and waxed.

ON VIEW: CHILDREN'S BENEFITS CHOOSE 'PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every seat from the orchestra to the balcony was paid for and filled for 
Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles' Phantom Gala -- weeks ahead. Because the 
committee held costs to $19 per person, the net will be a hefty $287,000. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning it was to be an all-heart, no-glitz evening, a family night 
at the Music Center. And there were families by the droves. William and Onnalee 
Doheny and Will and Libby Doheny organized 48 seats for a triple-generation 
celebration. Stephen and Louise Griffith flew in their offspring from New York 
because they hadn't been able to get "Phantom of the Opera" tickets there. 
Eleanor Griffin came with her grandson, Warren Techentin. Dody and Otis Booth 
brought her daughter, Ashley Brittingham. Jeff and Isabel Arnett led a troop. 
</P>
<P>
At intermission it was like an old-time ice cream social -- no ice cream, but 
plenty of strawberries, Phantom-masked in white and dark chocolate, almond 
truffles and pecan cookies served on silver trays by waiters -- all planned by 
Bonnie McClure, Susan Miller and Jan Shortz. 
</P>
<P>
Not that anyone was hungry. Pre-performance there were dozens of groups at the 
California Club. Childrens Hospital chairman Dr. Richard Call and his wife, 
Nancy, were surrounded by Kate and Joe Regan, Nancy and Ray McCullough and 
Leslie and Jim Thompson. Elsewhere in the Fireside Room, Anne Wilson and Camron 
Cooper hosted friends. 
</P>
<P>
In Toluca Lake, hospital board member Sid Petersen and Nancy invited three 
tables of guests for dinner before the show and trimmed up the house with some 
of the 1,900 black masks that were mailed last December to CHLA ticket buyers. 
Over at Engine Company 28 on Figueroa, Pam and Peter Mullin were the happy 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly it was a cheery evening. Nancy Burrows, a theater lover, however, was 
overcome by the performance, a situation that did little for her mascara. 
</P>
<P>
CHIPPING IN: A night earlier, the CHIPS (Colleague Helpers in Philanthropic 
Service) asked Betsy Bloomingdale to be honorary chairman for their "Phantom" 
benefit. Easily, they produced a $125,000 night to benefit Children's Institute 
International which serves abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Wilson Hobbs, there with her mother and father, William and Betty 
Wilson, takes over the CHIPS presidency. She was getting congratulations from 
president Isabel Leahey; benefit chairs Lisa Bloomingdale Bell and Nancy 
Wibblesman; and Mary Emmons, executive director of the Childrens Institute 
International. More in the crowd were Beverly Morsey, Jane and Craig Gosden, 
Marjorie Miller, Barbara and Marvin Davis and Natalie and Gwynn Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
JOIN THE THRONG: Amie Karen Cancer Fund has announced the founding of Rainbow 
II, a group of professionals to generate new community interest and to assist 
the Rainbow Women's Guild in fund-raising for Camp Rainbow and the Amie Karen 
Center for Treatment of Children with Cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
SUCCESS: "We dedicate this evening to you," Pepperdine University president 
David Davenport told Pepperdine Associates after campaign co-chairman Leonard 
Straus announced at the Beverly Hilton that the $100 million "Wave of 
Excellence" campaign had exceeded its goal with $134.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
ESCALATION: Anne and Kirk Douglas were saluted with the Jacoby Award from the 
UCLA International Student Center at a dinner at the Beverly Wilshire . . . 
</P>
<P>
Honorary chairs Sybil Brand, Cindy Chapman, Tanna Havlick, Susan Hook, 
Christine Huenergardt, Ellie Hustedt and Pat O'Connell were honored at tea -- 
fanfare before the sixth annual Celebrity Fashion Show to benefit cystic 
fibrosis Saturday at the Sheraton Universal.

PAST PERFECT: Pearl Bailey, special adviser to the U.S. mission to the United

Golda Meir Fellowship Award in an emotional ceremony at the Hebrew University 
Women's Committee Builders of Scopus dinner at Chasen's.

kindly described me as the designer of the Evolutionary Chair, which was part 
of the recent "Chair as Art" display at the Gallery of Art on Main Street in 
Santa Monica. To be fair, my colleagues at Gwynne Pugh and Associates -- Gwynne 
Pugh and James Dove -- also should receive the credit due them for their work

ONE MAN'S ART . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is amazing how an "artist" can sculpt, build, paint, or otherwise create 
unadulterated junk and then have it acclaimed as "art" by the cultural savants 
among us. Such is the case with Sam Rodia's Watts Towers ("Watts Towers: Latest 
Goal Is to Save Creator's Details" by Leon Whiteson, May 26). 
</P>
<P>
When I first saw Watts Towers in the 1950s, my reaction was that it was all a 
put-on and I couldn't figure out what all the shouting was about. Rodia's 
"masterpiece" is one of the biggest and slickest hoaxes of all time. Leon 
Whiteson called it right: Watts Towers is made of broken bottles, pottery 
shards, seashells and bits of iron -- held together by chicken wire smeared 
with ordinary builder's cement. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, junk.

ON AGING: FORD CO. DELVES INTO CUSTODIAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The UCLA-USC Longterm Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an area where few have dared to tread, the Ford Motor Co. has begun a pilot 
program for workers in Louisville that pays for non-medical custodial care at 
home or in a nursing home. About 6,600 people, including active employees and 
those who have retired since 1987, and their dependents, are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
The program provides help with activities of daily living -- eating, bathing, 
dressing, preparing meals and housecleaning -- for the severely impaired. It is 
intended to support rather than replace care provided by family and friends. 
Beneficiaries can briefly stay in a custodial nursing home, giving family 
members respite from care-giving. 
</P>
<P>
The Jefferson County Department of Human Services manages the program under 
contract with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan and Kentucky. County 
nurses and social workers determine eligibility and supervise the care. The 
program extends longstanding employee health benefits at Ford, which include 
skilled nursing care under a physician's supervision and hospice care for the 
terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
The new health plan, requested by the United Automobile Workers Union, is a 
pioneer employee-financed program. Similar pilot programs are being planned at 
General Motors and Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I am a 67-year-old widow in excellent health who enjoys her 
independence and freedom. However, like everyone else, I am beginning to feel 
the pressures of inflation. While I could use extra cash, I don't want to sell 
my house or take in boarders. A friend suggested I apply for a reverse 
mortgage, but couldn't provide details. Can you? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Reverse mortgages, also called home-equity conversion mortgages, allow 
owners to convert the equity in a home into cash that does not have to be 
repaid until the borrower moves or dies. 
</P>
<P>
A new Housing and Urban Development demonstration project will help those who 
own their homes but can't meet expenses to use their home equity as a source of 
income. Between now and Sept. 30, 1990, HUD will insure up to 2,500 FHA-insured 
reverse mortgages to homeowners age 62 or older who live in homes they own free 
and clear (or nearly so). 
</P>
<P>
According to HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, the insured 
mortgages offer three payment options: a tenure option, which provides monthly 
payments to homeowners as long as they occupy the home as a principal 
residence; a term option, which provides monthly payments for a fixed period 
selected by the homeowner; and a line-of-credit option, which permits 
homeowners to draw money at times and in amounts of their choosing up to a 
maximum amount. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the homeowner may receive lump-sum draws, combine a line of credit 
with monthly payments or change the payment plan if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the option selected, homeowners may continue to live in the house 
until they move, sell or die. They may sell their property at any time, 
retaining proceeds that exceed the amount needed to pay off the mortgage. 
Homeowners cannot be forced to sell their home to pay off the mortgage. HUD 
will insure lenders against the risk that the mortgage may grow to exceed the 
value of the property. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and a list of participating lenders, contact HUD USER, 
P.O. Box 6091, Rockville, Md. 20850, (800) 245-2691 or (301) 251-5154.

In French Polynesia this is the jumping-off point to adventure, the launching 
pad to hundreds of islands spread across millions of square miles of ocean, 
islands that conjure up mental images of coral reefs and white-sand beaches and 
groves of coconut palms that turn day into darkness. 
</P>
<P>
By propeller airplane it takes less than an hour to reach the island of 
Maupiti, where the life style has changed little since English explorer Capt. 
James Cook dropped anchor a couple of centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a bit longer to get to Rangiroa in the Tuamotus. And there's a 
freighter that does the trip to the Marquesas and the final resting place of 
artist Paul Gauguin in about 15 days, round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of these islands are blessed by a haunting remoteness, a detachment 
from everyday cares -- islands without so much as an airstrip. To reach them, 
one must take a freighter, although there's a slick new sailing vessel, the 
Wind Song, that does trips around French Polynesia and has staterooms that 
resemble a suite at the Savoy. 
</P>
<P>
But first there's Papeete with its fashionable hotels and restaurants, its 
sleazy clip joints and nightclubs, crowded streets, high-tech discos, office 
buildings and, down along the quay, expensive yachts, fishing boats and dozens 
of old rust buckets tied up alongside outriggers. It is here that freighters 
offload TV sets and foreign cars and hi-fi radios. 
</P>
<P>
The time for a stroll along Boulevard Pomare and its side streets is in the 
early morning hours while the air is still fresh. Later, the traffic backs up 
and exhaust fumes funnel through Papeete and the heat is oppressive. Everyone 
complains about Papeete. They curse the cars and the trash in the streets. Yes, 
even the freeway that leads rush-hour motorists out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first jet set down in Tahiti nearly 30 years ago, this once-sleepy 
backwater South Seas town has become overcrowded. There are villagers who 
refuse to go into Papeete. 
</P>
<P>
Paulette Vienot who operates tour buses, the Avis agency and Tahiti Nui Travel, 
senses a change in the Tahitian. Not the Tahitian on the outer islands, but 
those in Papeete. 
</P>
<P>
The old warmth is cooling, just as the aloha spirit in Hawaii has. In the old 
Tahiti, she recalls, she read by kerosene lamps and lived in the country, miles 
from Papeete, and it took two days by horse and buggy just to make the trip 
into town. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago this blue-eyed French Tahitian bought property with a beach 
on the island of Huahine, where she planned to retire and tend a garden and 
study the sunsets. Only she's too busy running her Tahiti Nui Travel Agency 
here and in San Francisco to smell the frangipani. 
</P>
<P>
The din in Papeete during daytime is reminiscent of American cities. Trucks 
line up near the municipal market and radios and tape decks blare out Tahitian 
music. Impatient motorists blast their horns--and sidewalks swell with 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Not all is lost, though. Authorities rebuilt the municipal market without 
destroying its old personality. Now it's a two-tiered affair where islanders 
continue to sell their fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, chickens, flowers and 
souvenirs. A block away a Chinese general store stocks Chanel No. 5, washtubs, 
canned escargots, mosquito coils, motorcycles and bras. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there the old charm surfaces. A few clapboard buildings with their 
verandas and corrugated tin roofs still stand, and a mixture of copra and 
frangipani drifts through the alleys, while crowds gather at the outdoor cafes 
and snack bars along Boulevard Pomare. 
</P>
<P>
They spoon ice cream and papaya and sip Hinano beer and study the handsome 
yachts moored along the quay. It is on the opposite side of Boulevard Pomare 
that the big change has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
New apartments and stores and office buildings stand where wooden storefronts 
once crowded the scene. One in particular rises on the very spot where Quinn's 
hosted the bold, the bad and the beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
As the most notorious bar in French Polynesia, Quinn's was where the painter 
Leeteg belted one too many one night, then climbed aboard his moped and spun 
off on a trip to eternity, colliding head-on with a tree. 
</P>
<P>
When they tore down Quinn's it was like disassembling the Eiffel Tower. Or 
uprooting the cable cars in San Francisco. Quinn's was a tourist attraction, an 
institution, the watering hole of Tahitians and tourists, French sailors and 
foreign legionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every tourist who ever set foot in Papeete rushed headlong to Quinn's to 
kick back and join the wicked who made Quinn's their home base. Well, the 
timorous did a detour, maybe, but the adventurous were fascinated with the 
motley crowd that kept the cash register ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, Quinn's was the most shameful bar in the entire Pacific. 
Customers ducked flying beer bottles while Suzy No Pants danced with the 
legendary Bali Hai Boys. 
</P>
<P>
There's never been a bar like it. Ever. It roared day and night. It was a 
bamboo jungle, a grimy, stinking, crowded waterfront joint that smelled of 
stale beer and disinfectant. In the old days, after closing time at Quinn's, 
everyone revved up their mopeds and roared off to Lafayette's whose reputation 
was every bit as lurid as Quinn's. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Quinn's and Lafayette's are gone doesn't mean that Papeete is tame. 
It's just that Quinn's and Lafayette's have been replaced by other watering 
holes. Expensive watering holes. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, most of Papeete is expensive. It was worse before the government 
cut import taxes on certain food items and alcohol. Prices were outrageous. A 
soft drink in a deluxe hotel could cost $5. Even now, travelers find few 
bargains. To be safe, the better deal is to buy a package tour with hotel, 
meals and a built-in flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gauguin Masterpieces 
</P>
<P>
The three major hotels on Papeete are expensive: the Beachcomber, the Maeva and 
the Hyatt Regency Tahiti. The latter, which is the former Tahara'a, overlooks a 
stunning black sand beach with rooms terraced down the hillside. At seven 
stories, the Maeva is the tallest hotel in Tahiti, its walls adorned with 
reproductions of Gauguin's masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
For honeymooners and other romantics, the Beachcomber does a package that 
features over-water bungalows, flowers, French Champagneand island tours by 
chauffeured limousine, with the seven-night bundle coming to $2,600. 
</P>
<P>
It's cheaper to run off to Moorea and take up housekeeping in one of Albert 
Hering's cottages that overlook Cook's Bay. Here, the rates start at a mere $30 
for a double with kitchen, shower and TV. The most expensive unit, at $60, 
sleeps four guests. The Century Plaza it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, modest best describes M. Hering's bungalows, an enclave of 19 one- and 
two-bedroom units that he calls Chez Albert. Linens are delivered at his whim, 
and humble though the bungalows are, the scene is straight out of "South 
Pacific," what with the peak known as Bali Hai rising on the horizon and the 
loveliest bay in all of French Polynesia flushing shores only a breath away. 
Vacationers watch spellbound as clouds envelop other peaks -- Mou Roa, Tamaru 
Tofa and Maua Puta. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of grocery stores are within biking distance, and one may dine 
inexpensively at three restaurants close by. Guests are told to write to M. 
Hering c/o Chez Albert, Pao Pao, Moorea, French Polynesia, but none of this 
guarantees a reply. At 77, M. Hering grows impatient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sailing to Tahiti 
</P>
<P>
You'll recognize the old man by his Swiss accent (he sailed to Tahiti more than 
60 years ago), and should he be absent, perhaps one of his offspring -- Corine, 
Heidi or Fritz -- will be on hand. At any rate, remember that Chez Albert is 
one of the better bargains in French Polynesia. While not fashionable, it's 
affordable -- with picture post card scenery that remains indelibly stamped in 
the mind long after one takes leave of Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
We spoke earlier of Papeete being the jumping-off point for adventure in the 
South Seas: In less than an hour one may fly to Maupiti, a speck of an island 
that lies within sight of Bora Bora. Maupiti has no hotels. Only a coral road, 
deserted beaches and a handful of cars. The landing strip is on a motu nearby, 
and you'd best let someone know you are arriving. Otherwise, it's possible to 
get stranded on the motu, which is exactly what happened recently to a 
government official who arrived unannounced and spent the day alone on the 
airstrip until someone spotted him and sent a canoe to rescue the poor fellow. 
By then he was sunburned, weary and more than a trifle angry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Thatched Bar 
</P>
<P>
On Maupiti there is absolutely nothing to do but sunbathe, or perhaps go 
fishing. Or stroll around the island. Or else stop for a beer at a thatched bar 
where locals gather to strum their guitars. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors seek shelter in pensions or with families, simply because on Maupiti 
there are no hotels. No rental cars, no taxis, no mopeds, no bikes, no banks. 
Not even a restaurant. Nothing. Nothing but magnificent sunsets and the peace 
that comes with being alone with one's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Papeete, the ultimate adventure is a 15-day voyage aboard the German 
freighter Aranui that sets a course taken by Gauguin, Robert Louis Stevenson 
and Herman Melville to the Marquesas. It is, indeed, the dream trip of every 
human who's ever toyed with the idea of stowing aboard a copra boat in the 
South Seas. 
</P>
<P>
Only this is no ordinary rust bucket, what with 17 air-conditioned cabins, 
daily maid service, French and Polynesian cuisine and chaise longues for 
soaking rays. Besides the cabins, the Aranui accommodates 40 passengers on 
mattresses spread across its deck. 
</P>
<P>
With darkness, crewmen from the Marquesas, the Tuamotus and the Australs sing 
the songs of their islands while the Milky Way lights up the night like a brush 
stroke by Gauguin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropping Anchor 
</P>
<P>
This year the Aranui will make 15 voyages between Tahiti and the Marquesas, 
dropping anchor at the atolls of Takapoto and Manihi with their black pearl 
farms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Papeete all eyes focus on Moorea, that stunning island across the 
Sea of the Moon whose peaks are crowned with brooding clouds that redden with 
sunset. In Papeete's harbor, along Boulevard Pomare, yachts rock in the shade 
of the twilight sky, so that Tahitians gliding by in their outriggers are but 
shadows on the peaceful surface. 
</P>
<P>
While Tahiti has changed and Japanese entrepreneurs are moving in to take over 
major hotels (with big expansions in mind), frangipani still spreads its 
fragrance and waterfalls continue to spill from verdant peaks, plunging into 
valleys choked with breadfruit, coconut palms and papaya. 
</P>
<P>
Country lanes are carpeted with blossoms, fishermen tend their nets and 
islanders sunbathe beside a lagoon that's a post card dream. 
</P>
<P>
The road that leads from town into the country and to the Gauguin Museum passes 
a series of coves. Mountains rise up, wet and green, and the din of discos in 
Papeete is forgotten . . . while a rainbow arches across the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
Old Tahiti calls. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To book passage on the freighter Aranui, see your travel agent or write 
to Compagnie Polinesienne de Transport Maritime, 595 Market St., San Francisco 
94105. Rates for the 15-day cruise between Tahiti and the Marquesas are 
$1,130-$3,160. A second freighter operated by the same company is scheduled to 
go into service next winter.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: SEARCHING FOR ANTIQUES AMONG THE ROCKFORD FILES

ROCKFORD, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're looking for a terrific mementos of turn-of-the-century antiques, head 
for this friendly industrial city about 75 miles northwest of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Rockford's population of roughly 148,000 supports two sizable antiques malls 
with nearly 200 dealers, two Saturday and Sunday antiques flea markets with 
dozens of dealers and more than a dozen individual antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
They sell all sorts of American antiques, including furniture, farm equipment, 
kitchen utensils, gadgets, books, prints, toys, clothing and personal 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Quality and condition of goods vary greatly from shop to shop, but prices are 
reasonable. That's because local dealers have purchased items directly from the 
attics and basements of families whose ancestors settled the town. 
</P>
<P>
This concentration of antiques outlets is only one aspect of Rockford's romance 
with the past. Before touring the shops, take time to absorb the city's 
fascinating history by browsing through several landmark sites, each lovingly 
restored and/or preserved by volunteer groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blacksmith's Shop 
</P>
<P>
Midway Village, a collection of turn-of-the-century buildings, gives visitors a 
glimpse into Rockford's past. It includes a post office, lawyer's and doctor's 
offices, a bank, blacksmith's shop, schoolhouse and church -- all with antique 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Tinker Swiss Cottage, a chalet-like residence built in 1865, provides a look at 
a wealthy Rockford family's Victorian life style. The Coronado Theater, an 
ornate 1925 vaudeville auditorium, has its original twinkling stars in the 
ceiling, gilded gargoyles of Abraham Lincoln and an organ that reproduces such 
sounds as thunder and sirens for accompanying silent films. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the antique furniture housed in these landmarks was donated by Rockford 
families, who were also sources for local antique dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known antique dealer in town is Barbara A. Johnson. Her expansive 
two-level shop at the Clock Tower Inn (7801 E. State St.) displays a stunning 
selection of furniture in model rooms. There are lovely 1830s tables ($2,500) 
and an apothecary's chest of drawers (with 20 drawers, $2,400), as well as 
cradles (from $750), sideboards, beds and corner cupboards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Duck Decoys 
</P>
<P>
Toys and objets d'art include a hand-carved Santa riding a pig ($725) and a 
fierce-looking wooden soldier riding a three-foot-long galloping horse 
($1,275). There are vintage coffee grinders ($225 and up); duck decoys ($155); 
paddle boards ($24 and up); old tin boxes decorated with biscuit and other food 
ads ($55 and up); copper kettles from the 1880s ($225 and up) and a vast 
selection of turn-of-the-century prints of children playing, gardens and floral 
themes ($12 and up). 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the shop offers stylistically compatible contemporary crafts, 
including heart-shaped rag rugs ($42) and Woody's rough-hewn cedar log 
sculptures ($18 and up) of mice, swans and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
In her booth at the enormous Land of Lincoln Antiques Mall (1201 Broadway), 
Johnson also shows such items as handsome handmade sewing boxes ($65), pine 
cupboards ($1,425) and children's rockers with cane seats ($165). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
140 Dealers 
</P>
<P>
The mall has about 140 dealers selling a wide range of merchandise, dating from 
the 1850s to the 1950s. It occupies a large building, with two stories and a 
basement divided to give dealers spacious individual booths. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen MacRae's booth shows 1870s wooden chests (from $125) and children's 
rockers (from $85), as well as hickory-seated chairs ($75), botanical prints 
(from $12) and antique wooden rulers ($4). 
</P>
<P>
The booth labeled Karen's Kountry Dolls features a delicate 1890s wax doll 
($210) and a wonderful 44-inch-tall 1880s papier-mache doll ($675), as well as 
porcelain and rag dolls and doll accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Other dealers display turn-of-the-century rough-hewn ladders ($40) and farm 
equipment, plus washboards (from $20), ironing boards ($28), shoe lasts (from 
$6), brass doll beds ($85), gilded mirrors ($85), wooden storage trunks ($295), 
quilts ($300 and up), huge walnut secretaries ($1,375), dining-room tables with 
or without sets of chairs, lace camisoles ($32 and up) and hundreds of 
beautifully illustrated books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maze of Booths 
</P>
<P>
Other memorabilia among the thousands on hand includes a Seeburg jukebox with 
records ($4,515), an aluminum carrousel horse in a special promotional base 
marked "Coca-Cola" ($1,200) and 1950s plastic handbags ($38) in perfect 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
East State Street Antiques Mall (5411 E. State St.) is a maze of booths filled 
with American antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual and appealing items include vintage cash registers ($895) and slot 
machines ($330 and up), green glass salt-and-pepper shakers ($18), the complete 
works of Charles Dickens in 30 volumes ($60), model ships ($45), oak and bamboo 
drop-front desks (about $500), a set of assorted knitting needles (with 40 
pairs of variously-sized needles, $65), 1920s ladies swimsuits in perfect 
condition ($10), Victorian lamps with brass Cupid bases ($1,200), Silvertone 
radios ($70) and grandfather clocks ($1,095). 
</P>
<P>
Victorian Village, at Longwood Street just off East State Street, is a 
three-block enclave of restored turn-of-the-century residences now housing 
antiques, crafts shops and eateries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full of Victoriana 
</P>
<P>
The best is Victorian House (128 Longwood St.), which is filled floor to 
ceiling with Victoriana, including hoop-back chairs ($395 for a pair), a walnut 
library table with petit-point cover ($595), fragile wooden comb holders ($40), 
magazine racks ($160), serving trays ($100), marble-top tables ($495 and up), 
drop-leaf sewing machine tables ($249) and glassware. 
</P>
<P>
Most unusual are framed pictures made out of braided and twisted human hair 
($125 and up). Owner Shirl Pfeiffer certifies all merchandise, and is a 
terrific source of information about Victorian times and life styles. 
</P>
<P>
Additional shops in Victorian Village include the Blue Hyacinth (123 Longwood 
St.) for antique glassware, china and pottery; Longwood Manor (132 N. Longwood 
St.) for reasonably-priced, turn-of-the-century European furniture and American 
objets d'art; Roberta McNames Antiques (136 N. Longwood) for antique household 
goods ranging from wood-burning stoves ($100 and up) to school room desks ($95) 
and Country Squire Antiques (330 N. 6th St.), with oak, pine and walnut 
furniture beautifully displayed in a home-like setting. 
</P>
<P>
Don't overlook individual antique shops scattered throughout Rockford, 
including McMullens Misc. (1510 Broadway) for vintage cash registers, gum-ball 
machines and arcade shooting games, as well as old bicycles, clocks, radios, 
stained-glass lamps ($35 and up) and mounted steer horns ($10). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flea Markets 
</P>
<P>
Forgotten Treasures (2310 Charles St.) has a good selection of oak, pine and 
walnut furniture dating from the 1890s through the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Rockford's two weekend flea markets are not far from each other. The Greater 
Rockford Antique Flea Market is at Alpine and Sandy Hollow Roads, while the 
Southgate Antiques Flea Market is at Sandy Hollow and Eleventh Street. Both 
have indoor and outdoor booths, and the ambience is as fascinating as the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
As you weave through aisles of tables displaying everything from antique coins 
and vintage records to drill bits and wrenches, you'll be entertained with 
local lore from friendly dealers. No telling in advance what you'll find to 
buy, but the flea markets are a fun adventure through Americana. 
</P>
<P>
Rockford is spread out, so you'll need a car to get from antique mall to shop 
to market. 
</P>
<P>

Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, 220 E. State St., Rockford, Ill. 61104,

YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET SERVICES OFFERED IN SCOTLAND AND FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Special services to help young travelers' budgets will be available in Paris 
and Scotland this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Paris' youth information offices, Acceuil Des Jeunes en France (AJF), makes 
free on-the-spot reservations for accommodations, books inexpensive 
transportation services and finds student restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer months AJF offers about 11,000 beds at budget rates. About 
5,000 are in multishare rooms in youth hotels, and cost between 72 and 90 
francs ($12 to $15) per person, breakfast included. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most convenient AJF offices is at Gare Du Nord (North railway 
station) inside the new suburban station. During summer months it's open every 
day from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Beaubourg office is opposite the Georges Pompidou Centre at 119 Rue St. 
Martin. It's open Monday to Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Rambuteau is the 
closest Metro stop. The Marais office is near the Town Hall at 16 Rue de Pont 
Louis-Phillippe. The closest Metro station is Hotel de Ville, open between June 
and September, Monday to Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If you're near the Latin Quarter, another office is at 139 Blvd. St. Michel, 
near the Luxembourg Metro stop. It's open March to October, Monday to Friday, 
9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breakfast Included 
</P>
<P>
In many European countries breakfast is included in overnight stays, even if at 
a youth hostel or student hotel. Breakfast usually is bread, jam, possibly some 
cheese, and coffee or hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
In Scotland, when you stay in a bed and breakfast the breakfasts are usually 
substantial. You can expect toast, eggs, bacon, juice and coffee or tea. During 
the low-travel seasons many B&amp;Bs are on good-value rates -- 7.50 to 10 ($12 
to $16) per person a night. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, when rates rise and availability is low, other options are 
available, such as accommodations and special do-it-yourself tour packages 
offered by the Scottish Youth Hostel Assn. 
</P>
<P>
This year SYHA's "Explore Scotland" package offers independent travelers budget 
accommodations and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In the package is a seven-day Citylink bus pass, valid for travel on the 
Scottish mainland, plus travel to the Isle of Skye, and vouchers for six nights 
of youth hostel accommodations, plus a handbook, a map and a bus timetable, a 
discount card for tourist services, and a pass for admission to historic 
monuments. The package is available until Sept. 30 for 59. 
</P>
<P>
The "Highland Wayfarer" package offers a 7- or 14-day pass for unlimited rail, 
bus and ferry travel, plus seven or 14 vouchers for youth hostel 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Round-trip transportation between Glasgow, Aberdeen or Edinburgh and the 
travel-pass area also is included. During June, July and August seven-night 
packages cost 89, 14-night versions are 134. Rates are slightly lower in spring 
and fall. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact Breakaway Holidays, Scottish Youth Hostels Assn. 
(SYHA), National Office, 7 Glebe Cresent, Stirling, Scotland FK8 2J8, or check 
with travel agencies affiliated with national youth hostel associations.

GRAND MARAIS, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most visitors claim the formation named Chapel Rock resembles a mystical castle 
or church. 
</P>
<P>
But from my vantage point atop a cliff to the west, it looks malevolent rather 
than regal or religious, a giant multihued skull with gaping eyeholes that 
stare relentlessly over Lake Superior. Its horrendous grin gloats over the 
graveyard of many a Great Lakes vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Nature will have revenge, however. Just as thousands of years of natural forces 
shaped the sandstone into this formation, the waves and wind continue to nibble 
and gouge away at Chapel Rock, returning it piece by piece to sand. 
</P>
<P>
This is Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, stretching along the northern shore 
of Michigan's Upper Peninsula between Grand Marais and Munising. 
</P>
<P>
Officially the first of America's national lakeshores, this was familiar 
territory to the Chippewa. French explorers and Jesuit missionaries passed 
these startling cliffs and sand dunes in search of wealth, territory and souls. 
</P>
<P>
Father Jacques Marquette, the best known of the region's early priests, 
reputedly preached to the Indians from Miners Castle, another large formation. 
</P>
<P>
Today's visitor can feel, as the Indians did, that spirits are present in these 
stones of many colors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terrain Varies Tremendously 
</P>
<P>
Although the distance from end to end is relatively short and the park itself 
is never more than three miles wide, the terrain varies tremendously. There are 
sand dunes and beaches, high cliffs and waterfalls, lakes and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
With its pounding surf, white sand, driftwood and gulls pecking for morsels 
along the beach or soaring above the waves, this could be Cape Cod or the 
Jersey Shore or Florida's Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike these spots, Lake Superior is shiveringly cold even in the heat of the 
summer, although our children, seemingly immune to water temperature that sends 
adults scurrying for towels, enjoyed the waves. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches are fertile hunting grounds for brightly colored rocks and pebbles, 
including agates, smoothed by glacial and water action. 
</P>
<P>
The park's very remoteness makes it a place where imagination can rule. Also, 
it's impossible to see a lot of the spectacular scenery by car from the one 
country road -- partly paved -- that gives access to the park. 
</P>
<P>
Only one large formation -- Miners Castle -- the beach at Grand Sable Lake and 
a section of glistening Twelvemile Beach are accessible by road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
By Foot or by Boat 
</P>
<P>
That leaves two options: by foot and by boat. 
</P>
<P>
By foot means hiking, either day walks from the trail-head parking lots to the 
beaches and cliffs, or treks with overnight camping along part or all the 
43-mile Lakeshore Trail that hugs the coast. By boat means three-hour cruises 
from Munising, weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
The trail, part of the 3,200-mile North Country National Scenic Trail between 
New York and North Dakota, has its rough spots. 
</P>
<P>
Expect some steep climbs and descents, with roots and stone outcroppings as 
steps, as well as mud, sand and low-hanging branches. At other points you'll 
find wooden boardwalks and log bridges to cross rivers and wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Leisurely hikes of up to a few miles each begin at various parking areas and 
end at some of the park's best known attractions, including Grand Sable Dunes, 
Miner's Falls and the Log Slide. 
</P>
<P>
At the eastern edge of the park, trails along the dunes -- sometimes indistinct 
in the shifting sands -- lead through tough beach grass, goldenrod and small 
patches of conifers fighting with varying degrees of success for a foothold and 
survival. From the wind-swept ridges, the view is Lake Superior's many shades 
of blue. 
</P>
<P>
For those who opt to backpack, the park offers a series of free backcountry 
campgrounds, each with three to 15 relatively private sites along the trail. 
Reservations are allowed, and permits can be picked up from rangers or at the 
visitor centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spectacular Sunsets 
</P>
<P>
Because these campgrounds are close to the water, sunsets are spectacular when 
the skies are clear. 
</P>
<P>
There also are three drive-in campgrounds operated by the National Park Service 
and a fourth run by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. These, 
however, do not accept reservations, charge a fee and fill quickly during 
vacation season. 
</P>
<P>
Bring binoculars. Don't ignore the frequent overlooks along the trail, vantage 
points for photographs, rest and appreciation of the setting. In August you can 
forage for ripe wild blueberries, small and sweet, as we did. 
</P>
<P>
Conifers, beech, sugar maples, birch and an occasional mountain ash, its 
reddish-orange berries adding brightness to the green foliage, grow along the 
top of the cliffs. The trail brings you close to several gull rookeries, where 
you can watch the birds dive for fish. 
</P>
<P>
The cliff walls are like natural canvas worked by unknown artists in black, 
red, orange, white and gray. Minerals leaching from between the layers of 
sandstone "paint" the "pictures" that give the park its name. 
</P>
<P>
Some resemble the work of modernists, possibly intoxicated, with bright 
splashes of color, slap-dashedly applied. Other sections look more deliberately 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
Isolated though it may seem, the human presence is visible on the lake, at 
least temporarily, much like footprints in the sand before they are erased by 
the rising tide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cliff-Hanger 
</P>
<P>
One evening after supper, perched on a cliff top near our backcountry campsite, 
we watched a tugboat slowly tow two heavily loaded barges westward. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, with the water calm, a small brightly colored sailboat cruised 
along the base of the cliffs, past caves and arches carved into the colored 
rock by the water. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking, we waved to passengers on the tour boats far below us. They, in turn, 
snapped photos of us backpackers on the trail high above. 
</P>
<P>
That human presence has not always been so transient. After the French and then 
the British lost control in the late 18th Century, American settlers began to 
use and exploit the resources. 
</P>
<P>
This once was timber country, for example, and its white pine helped build the 
cities of the Midwest. Evidence is still visible at spots such as Kingston 
Lake, a state forest campground in the national lakeshore's inland buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, a hike along the Fox River Trail, which leads south from the 
campground to the Seney National Wildlife Refuge 27 1/2 miles away, reveals 
slowly rotting stumps, lasting legacies of the lumbering era. 
</P>
<P>
At the Log Slide inside the park, lumberers shoved logs down a 500-foot wooden 
chute into Lake Superior for towing to the sawmills. Sand was used to put out 
the flames when the heat of the friction set the slide ablaze. The slide itself 
is long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Exploitation also came in the form of charcoal kilns and blast furnaces, fueled 
by the area' abundant forests to refine the iron ore mined in the western Upper 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boom and Decline 
</P>
<P>
Artifacts and exhibits about the boom and decline of those endeavors are 
displayed at the park's Munising Falls Visitor Center, while the forest, in its 
own quiet but relentless way, has reclaimed the physical ruins of blast furnace 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
For a different view of Pictured Rocks, we boarded a double-decker tour boat at 
the Munising city pier, where Capt. Doug Morrison promptly launched into a 
narrative about differential erosion and shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
We cruised past heavily wooded Grand Island, once home to Indian villages, fur 
trading posts and a summer resort, but now without any year-round residents. A 
post-Civil War copper-topped wooden lighthouse with boarded-up windows still 
stands on the island's shore. 
</P>
<P>
Miners Castle is the first major landmark we spot within the park. From here, 
it's obvious how a zealous Father Marquette would have chosen it as a natural 
pulpit far more impressive than that inside any cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Offshore from the park lies the state's Alger Underwater Preserve, a popular 
spot for divers who enjoy exploring sunken wrecks, rock formations and caves. 
</P>
<P>
A number of local charter and dive companies offer equipment rentals and tours. 
Mapped dive sites include the resting places of 19th-Century vessels such as 
the steam barge Smith Moore and the side-wheel steamer Superior. Among the 
20th-Century wrecks are the freighter Manhattan and the steamer Kiowa. 
</P>
<P>
Hugging the shore, our boat presented a prime view of water-level caves, 
enlarged regularly by frost, the undercutting action of powerful waves and 
early spring cave-ins. 
</P>
<P>
The boat inched forward into a narrow "painted" cove, then backed out 
carefully. We passed sandy beaches where the Mosquito and Miners rivers empty 
into chill Superior, then rounded Grand Portal Point. 
</P>
<P>
There, just ahead, loomed Chapel Rock. To me, far below at water level, it 
remained a giant skull vigilantly guarding its realm. I don't argue with those 
passengers who called it a castle or a church, for we all are entitled to our 
own myths at Pictured Rocks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The closest airports to the park are at Sault Ste. Marie to the east and 
Marquette to the west. Rental cars are available. The park is open year-round. 
There is no park entrance fee. Commercial boat tours run from early June to 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
Public campgrounds with a limited number of sites are located in the park. None 
of the sites have electric or water hook-ups. Most motels in Munising and Grand 
Marais are small (under 20 units) and independently owned, with double rates of 
about $30. Munising has a Best Western that is larger and about twice as 
expensive. For reservations call (906) 387-4864.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: HOTEL OWNERSHIP HAS BECOME A FOREIGN CONCEPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What do the following hotels or hotel companies have in common? 
Regent Beverly Wilshire, Los Angeles; Ramada Inn and The Drake, New York; 
Watergate in Washington; Hotel Atop The Bellevue, Philadelphia, and the Omni 
Ambassador East, Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Each is owned and/or managed by a foreign company. In Chicago, in the 
midst of a major hotel boom, most of the new construction is for foreign-owned 
and/or managed hotels with names such as Nikko, Swiss Grand, Kempinski, 21 East 
and Four Seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, the Beverly Wilshire is owned by a group of Asian investors, 
and the Beverly Hills Hotel by the Sultan of Brunei. The legendary Bel Air 
Hotel was recently sold to a Japanese company for $1.2 million . . . per room. 
</P>
<P>
About the only major Beverly Hills hotel not owned by foreigners is the 
592-room Beverly Hilton, which was bought by Merv Griffin for $100.2 million 
when he outbid Japanese investors in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And Beverly Hills has no monopoly on this statistic. Virtually every major 
hotel in Hawaii, with the exception of the Hilton Hawaiian Village (co-owned by 
Hilton and Prudential Insurance), is owned by Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to accept the fact that the foreign hotels are here in a big way," 
said Barron Hilton, chairman and president of Hilton Hotels Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel business is a very competitive arena. In a recession environment 
there's less hotel development. But the growth trends are soaring. People are 
becoming more mobile. New planes will be able to fly more people longer 
distances. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be an increased demand for facilities, and a foreign clientele may 
feel more comfortable in a familiar environment when they travel abroad. So it 
doesn't surprise me that the objective of many foreign hotels is to be 
established in the principal cities of the world." 
</P>
<P>
And Hilton's Hawaiian Village property is still very much a foreign target. One 
offer -- from a Japanese company -- is rumored to have been $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a number of overtures made asking whether we would sell," 
Hilton said. "We have no interest in selling our 50% interest . . . now." 
</P>
<P>
But Hilton has not been a total holdout when it comes to unloading unprofitable 
properties. Recently, Hilton and Prudential Insurance, co-owners of the Hilton 
Turtle Bay resort, on the north side of Oahu, sold the hotel and its 800 acres 
to Asahi Junkin. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it is nothing less than a foreign invasion of American hotels, an 
invasion that involves Germans, Swiss, Canadians, groups from Hong Kong and, of 
course, the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Hong Kong-based hotel groups have spent more than $500 
million in acquiring U.S. hotels. The Mandarin hotel group (The Oriental in 
Bangkok, the Mandarin in Hong Kong) opened the Mandarin in San Francisco, but 
lost out to Donald Trump in a bid to buy The Plaza in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Regent hotels, after disappointing performances in Washington (where the former 
Regent is now called The Grand), Albuquerque and Honolulu, are trying again. 
Regent bought and then totally renovated the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills, 
and recently announced plans to build a hotel in Manhattan designed by I. M. 
Pei. 
</P>
<P>
Next on Regent's U.S. agenda is a possible new hotel in San Francisco, a city 
already overloaded with foreign hotels (Nikko, Portman, Mandarin, Meridien and 
others). 
</P>
<P>
When the Bel Air Hotel sold for more than $100 million last month, it was a 
financial shot heard round the hotel world. The previous per-room purchase 
record was achieved when the 260-room Beverly Hills Hotel sold in 1987 for 
$757,000 per room. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an outrageous price to pay," said Stan Bromley, regional vice president 
and general manager of the Four Seasons Clift Hotel in San Francisco. "But they 
wanted a 'trophy' hotel, and they paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
"By normal hotel financing standards, if it cost you $150,000 to build each 
hotel room, the individual rooms should rent for $150 per night -- or one 
dollar for every thousand dollars spent. But in this case, it's ridiculous. In 
order to make their money back, the new owners of the Bel Air should be 
charging $1,200 a night for each room. They'll never do it." 
</P>
<P>
"He's right," said Atef Mankarious, president of the Rosewood Hotel Group, 
which manages the Bel Air. "We'll never charge that rate. You can't look at 
this hotel as normal. The new owners look at it as a work of art, like the Van 
Gogh painting that sold for $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of a kind. It can't be duplicated. It is a valuable asset as opposed 
to a profit center. And it will only increase in value. And we won't tamper 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
The key to any new foreign ownership is whether the new owners keep the old 
management. In the case of the Bel Air, they have. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens," said the Clift's Bromley, "a hotel can maintain and even 
improve a good reputation, because staff morale remains high and new capital is 
invested into the operation." 
</P>
<P>
That is not always the case. In New York City, the old 23-story Gotham Hotel, 
vacant for many years, became Maxim's de Paris Hotel. The owners soon sold the 
250-room building for $127 million to the Peninsula group in Hong Kong, which 
changed the name to the Peninsula. Staff turnover followed, and there was a 
discernible lag time to train new employees. Service suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real problem," said Patrick Board, general manager of the Mayfair 
Inter-Continental Hotel in London. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the parent corporation of Inter-Continental, Grand Met, was 
trying to sell it, it slashed Board's staff, and service standards at the hotel 
were strained. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff-to-guest ratio fell apart," Board complained. But he didn't have to 
worry for long. After the Saison Group of Japan bought Inter-Continental for 
$2.27 billion, it allowed Board to hire more staff and make needed renovations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now back up to speed," Board said. (Recently, Saison sold 40% of 
Inter-Continental to SAS). 
</P>
<P>
"We look at the Four Seasons involvement from a different point of view," said 
George Schwab, chief executive of the Pierre Hotel in New York. "When we took 
over, we found a staff that was embroiled in confusion and set in its ways. 
They had also been treated as employees and not as part of a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you believe that we actually had staff who had never been above the 
first floor because they didn't think they would be allowed?" 
</P>
<P>
Now Schwab encourages staffers to stay at the hotel, so they can experience the 
kind of service they will be expected to provide. 
</P>
<P>
But a key question remains for hoteliers and guests alike: What can foreign 
ownership and management do to a hotel that U.S. companies can't? And, if that 
results in higher room rates, will guests pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
"We bring a concept and a style of service to the United States that others 
don't," said Robert Burns, president of Regent Hotels. "It's a cultural 
difference that develops and then maintains a higher standard. I look at it as 
a combination of the high Swiss standard of hoteliers coupled with the concept 
of Asian service." 
</P>
<P>
It almost seems like a rhetorical question: Can you really duplicate the Asian 
concept of service with an American labor force? 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can," said Yasuyuki Miura, president and chief operating officer 
of Hotel Nikko U.S.A. "Our experience has been that if we employ Japanese 
people to provide Japanese service, it works. But the American labor market is 
different. For us, it's a slow process." 
</P>
<P>
When Nikko acquired the Essex House hotel in New York, "We sent all the 
employees to Japan, and not vice versa," Miura said. "Seeing was believing, as 
well as opening communication with their Japanese counterparts, front desk to 
front desk, housekeeping to housekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
Nikko developed "quality control circles" where staffers met to work out 
problems in service and efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to force our style on Americans," Miura said. "After all, 85% 
of our guests are American." 
</P>
<P>
"Our hotel laundries are now open seven days a week," said Regent's Burns. "And 
we've put stewards on the floors at the Beverly Wilshire, because that's what 
we do in Hong Kong, and that's what our guests now expect." 
</P>
<P>
And, the guests should also expect to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll notice that these foreign hotel companies aren't building in Kansas 
City," said Bill Marriott, chairman and chief executive officer of the Marriott 
corporation. "They're only doing these hotels in major international gateway 
cities, catering to a clientele that isn't rate sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, for example, when the new Regent hotel is completed, average room 
rates will hover near $400 a night. 
</P>
<P>
"The new foreign trend scares me a little," said Jonathan Tisch, president and 
chief executive of Loews hotels. "A lot of these companies come in and try to 
steal away staff from other hotels at higher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"This, coupled with their initial capital investment, means they have to raise 
their room rates. But how much can they charge? How much is too high? You can 
ask whatever you want, but will you get it? That's what we're all waiting to 
see."

QUEEN ANNE: ECLECTIC, ORNATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many well-known and prominent men are there who can in no small measure 
attribute their success to their architects, for designing and producing for 
them, homes or buildings striking and commanding and holding one's attention? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Architect J. Cather Newsom 
</P>
<P>
The "striking and commanding" homes of Newsom's ringing phrases were designed 
-- many by Newsom himself -- in the flamboyant, late-Victorian style known as 
Queen Anne. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of its fashion during the 1880s and '90s, the Queen Anne, and its 
companion style, known as Eastlake, graced California's most elegant suburbs. 
The homes were distinguished by their steep slate roofs, fretworked timber 
gables, bonneted turrets and painted spindle-work porches. 
</P>
<P>
Superseded by the rage for Craftsman architecture at the turn of the century, 
Queen Anne-Eastlake homes stand as reminders of the frantic Los Angeles land 
boom of the late-1800s, which converted districts such as Bunker Hill and 
Angelino Heights into gracious neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The name Queen Anne is historically ambiguous. Originated in Britain in the 
1860s by architect Richard Norman Shaw, the late-Victorian Queen Anne-style 
bears no relation to the style of the period of the real English Queen Anne, 
who reigned briefly in the early 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Anne-style had become even more eclectic by the time it arrived on the 
West Coast, following its popularization in the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial 
Exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
In its passage across the continent, it collected a variety of extra details 
and mannerisms, derived from the East Coast Eastlake-style, plus elements of 
Victorian Romanesque, Rococo and Renaissance Revival, with added exotic bits 
and pieces copied from Moorish and Oriental architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"Where does Newsom get his ideas?" Queen Anne popularizer Newsom asked 
rhetorically in his 1895 book "Artistic City Buildings, Flats and Residences." 
</P>
<P>
Revealing that the source of his inspiration was a large library of books and 
photographs, he said: "It is from these I take new features, taking a feature 
here and there, and making a happy result." 
</P>
<P>
Queen Anne's elaborate details and construction were made both possible and 
affordable by the modern technology of the Industrial Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
At its heart was the innovative lightweight "balloon" frame that allowed whole 
sections of timber framing to be prefabricated and assembled on site. 
</P>
<P>
The balloon frame, now standard in all timber house construction, replaced the 
traditional mortise-and-tenon post-and-beam framing that was heavier and more 
labor intensive. 
</P>
<P>
Historically nostalgic Queen Anne details such as fretwork and friezes became 
cheap to make through the use of new inventions, such as the iron steam press 
and the scroll jigsaw, which could economically sculpt wood into decorative 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Anne was a typically Victorian mixture of stylistic nostalgia and 
technological innovation, said architectural historian David Gebhard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an age marked by a passionate, evangelistic belief in progress, 
countered by a clinging to the cultural reassurance of the architecture of the 
past," Gebhard said. "The idea of the modern was fused with a longing for the 
ancient." 
</P>
<P>
The Victorians tried to look backward and forward at the same time, Gebhard 
explained, toward a brave new world of technical miracles and a mythologized 
history of social stability and moral order. 
</P>
<P>
"They reacted ambiguously to the speed of change," he said, "mixing a rejection 
with an embrace." 
</P>
<P>
Being "modern" was very much the rage among the late-Victorians, despite the 
eclectic nostalgia of their architecture. It was a prime concern for Newsom and 
his brother, Samuel, who led the fashion for Queen Anne in California from 
their offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In their pattern books and periodicals, which were copied by many other 
architects and builders, the Newsoms warned the public to "Avoid the old fogy 
architects, who have had their day . . . on account of their not keeping up and 
being posted on all that is new and latest." 
</P>
<P>
And Southern California in the 1880s was the Promised Land of "all that is new 
and latest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rapid Transformation 
</P>
<P>
Recently made accessible by railroad connections, the Southland "awaited 
transformation into a Real Eden," Gebhard said, "with a touch of the wand -- 
water, capital and the Puritanical ethic of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
The Southland's paradisal transformation was rapid. In the final decades of the 
19th Century the trinity of water, capital and hard work, fertilized by rampant 
boosterism, changed a semi-desert into a flourishing city set among orange 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen Anne-style best symbolized the endless energy and cheerful 
flamboyance of this newly created Californian Eden. 
</P>
<P>
From San Diego to Santa Monica, Queen Anne and Eastlake homes raised their 
fretworked gables and perky turrets to the sky in a bold toast to progress and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
The heady atmosphere of the period may be savored in the Angelino Heights 
section of Echo Park, which boasts the finest surviving concentration of Queen 
Anne homes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loving Restoration 
</P>
<P>
Carroll Avenue in Angelino Heights is host to an array of Queen Anne and 
Eastlake homes that have been lovingly restored by young professionals in 
search of affordable housing with character. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara and Andrew Thornburg bought 1316 Carroll Ave. in 1973. At the cost of 
much personal labor and considerable expense, they have restored the 
once-derelict 1887 Eastlake-style house, with its ship's wheel staircase 
design, Lincrusta paper friezes, hand-carved fireplace surrounds and molded 
plaster cornices into a delightfully authentic Victorian memento. 
</P>
<P>
"The house was a junkyard when we discovered it," Barbara Thornburg recalled. 
"The redwood frame was riddled with dry rot. Many window frames were eaten away 
by termites. The place was a sad sight, like a Victorian grand dame fallen upon 
ruin." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade the Thornburgs themselves stripped every surface of old 
lead paint, caulked each nail and had new window frames milled to the old 
pattern. The house took four years to paint in the dark-green-and-white-trim 
color scheme the owners carefully researched for its authenticity to the 
original Eastlake decor. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about sweat equity," Barbara Thornburg said ruefully. "This place is 
Perspiration Palace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Ornamental 
</P>
<P>
The Eastlake style, named for English furniture designer Charles Lockewood 
Eastlake, was less ornate than the Queen Anne, and in some ways its opposite in 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Eastlake yearned for a return to "plain ornament" in reaction to late-Victorian 
architectural extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, the Eastlake style -- with its ornately detailed and 
steeply gabled roofs and "stickwork" boarding laid in a variety of patterns -- 
was usually elaborated way beyond plainness in a fusion with Queen Anne 
exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
A superb marriage of Queen Anne and Eastlake is found at 824 E. Kensington Road 
in Echo Park. The design of this 1880 mansion, probably copied by its anonymous 
builder from one of the popular pattern books of the period, is Queen Anne in 
its spritely turrets and generous porches, its multiple gables, thrusting 
dormers and Moorish arches. But the curlicued clarity of its white-painted 
fretwork is pure Eastlake. 
</P>
<P>
The 1886 cottage built by Elias Jackson (Lucky) Baldwin in Arcadia is another 
splendid fusion of Queen Anne and Eastlake mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
Now on the grounds of the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, the lovingly 
restored and furnished cottage designed by A. A. Bennett, one of the architects 
for the State Capitol in Sacramento, features a three-tiered turret topped by a 
viewing platform. Here, it is said, the eccentric millionaire would stand 
mournful watch for his fourth wife, who left him before the house was finished. 
</P>
<P>
Late-Victorian interiors were stuffed with a mixture of furnishings as eclectic 
as their exteriors. Every inch of surface in the walls, doors, windows and 
ceilings pulsated with opulent detail and decoration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beds Big as Boats 
</P>
<P>
Patterned parquet floors and molded redwood door frames competed for attention 
in the subdued light with vigorously textured wallpapers featuring busy 
medallions or lush floral designs. Front parlors were crowded with overstuffed 
deep-buttoned red-velvet armchairs and settees. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrooms boasted carved and canopied beds big as boats. Richly carved, solidly 
crafted Rococo and Renaissance Revival rosewood sideboards were miniature 
architectures in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the biggest and most flamboyant Queen Anne mansions designed by the 
Newsoms in Los Angeles -- such as the magnificent 1887 Bradbury House, built by 
the owner of downtown's famous Bradbury Building -- vanished when Bunker Hill 
was flattened by bulldozers during the brutal "urban renewal" programs of the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popularized Style 
</P>
<P>
The 1889 house built by J. Cather Newsom for dairyman Charles Sessions at 1330 
Carroll Ave. is a reminder of the architect's playful skill. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of fierce stone Chinese dogs guards the steps that lead to a tier of 
porches with round Oriental archways mixed with Moorish spindle woodwork and a 
turret topped by a spiky finial bearing a weathercock. 
</P>
<P>
The last word on Queen Anne must belong to Newsom, whose buildings and writings 
did the most to popularize the style in Southern California. Referring to the 
inspiration of the style, he declared: 
</P>
<P>
"Architecture is an art primarily, and hardly anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECOGNIZING QUEEN ANNE-EASTLAKE HOMES 
</P>
<P>
Two to three stories tall, often with a basement. 
</P>
<P>
First-floor front porches, raised above ground and reached by a short flight of 
steps, feature spindle-work friezes and balustrades. 
</P>
<P>
Steep, multicolored slate roofs, punctuated by dormers and bonneted turrets, 
with high fretworked gable ends. 
</P>
<P>
Lower floors finished in brick or stone; upper levels have fish-scale shingles 
or clapboarding. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of bay windows, patterned brick chimneys, oriels, stained glass and 
plaster swags, sometimes set off by Moorish arches, onion domes or Oriental 
woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborately paneled entry halls, with fancy carved wooden staircases, filled 
with the rainbow tones of rich stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
Dark main rooms, also paneled, with parquet flooring, ceilings decorated with 
medallions and crown moldings, wallpapered walls with friezes and wainscotting, 
and fireplaces of patterned tile or carved hardwood.

HOT PROPERTY: STREISAND STARS IN $6-MILLION DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BARBRA STREISAND closed escrow last week on the former Richard Harris home in 
the Beverly Hills post office area. 
</P>
<P>
Title was taken in the name of a trust to benefit the actress, said realtors 
not involved in the nearly $6-million deal. The house was sold by John 
Donnelly, described as the British actor's "front man." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Stephen Shapiro, president/partner of Stan Herman &amp; Associates, who 
represented the seller, nor Juan Alvarez of Alverez, Hyland &amp; Young, who 
represented the buyer, would comment. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in the late 1930s by architect Wallace Neff for pioneer 
film maker King Vidor. Singer/songwriter Mac Davis and Broadway 
composer/lyricist Jerry Herman were later owners. Harris bought it in the '70s 
but never lived there. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 film "The Witches of Eastwick" was filmed in the barn-style house, on 
6 acres with a view from the ocean to downtown. The house will be torn down by 
Streisand, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Streisand also has homes in Holmby Hills and Malibu. Her Malibu compound has 
been for sale since 1987. Bruce Nelson of Asher Dann &amp; Associates has the 
current listing, at $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTOPHER SKASE, known as the Donald Trump of Australia, is buying the Goetz 
Estate in Holmby Hills, real estate sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Skase, whose Qintex Entertainment announced in April that it would buy MGM-UA 
Communications Co. for $1 billion, has been house hunting for months but opened 
escrow a few days ago, we were told, on the 17,000-square-foot Georgian-style 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to what Skase is paying for the mansion, a Beverly Hills realtor who 
asked for anonymity said: "He's paying in the 8s. We're talking millions, of 
course." Asking price was $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1934, the house was owned for years by Edie Goetz, daughter of movie 
mogul Louis B. Mayer, and her producer-husband, William. The star-studded 
dinner parties they gave at the house were renowned during Hollywood's golden 
era. 
</P>
<P>
William Goetz died in 1969; Edie, a year ago this month. The 2-acre property is 
being sold by their daughters, Judith Shepherd of Beverly Hills and Barbara 
Windom of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
There is another house for sale at $22 million in Orange County. That was 
believed to be the highest price ever asked for an Orange County home when a 
Tustin house, listed with Beverly Hills agent Bruce Nelson, came on the market 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
Now Marion Buie, a Newport Beach broker, has a $22-million listing: the 
18,500-square-foot South Laguna home of Harry Reinsch, former president of 
Bechtel Corp., and his wife, Helen. 
</P>
<P>
"They just aren't using it that often," Buie said. The Reinschs' principal 
residence is in San Francisco, and they have another house in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
It should be fun to see which house becomes the county's largest single-family 
sale. So far, the highest is thought to be the $6.5-million purchase in 
December of John Wayne's former Newport Beach home by Robert Cohen, co-owner of 
the Four Seasons hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the $22-million listings, an impending Orange County sale is in the 
running: the 18,000-square-foot house under construction on Harbor Island and 
in escrow for "close to its asking price" of $14.5 million, according to its 
listing broker. He wouldn't say when escrow will close, but the house won't 
even be completed for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south . . . La Jolla is getting its share of multimillion-dollar home 
sales, judging from three handled by the Willis M. Allen Co. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was the $9.95-million sale of an estate with a view stretching to 
Newport Beach. That 5-plus-acre property has waterfalls, nature trails, golf 
greens, a tennis court, lap and free-form pools, spas, a basketball court, an 
office suite, a wine-tasting room, a wine cellar and a garage that can house 
eight cars, including a limousine. 
</P>
<P>
The seller was Douglas F. Manchester, developer of the Hotel Intercontinental 
(now the San Diego Marriott) and chairman of Torrey Enterprises, and the buyers 
were William Bennett and his wife, Sam, owners of the Circus Circus 
Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the $5-million-plus purchase of a 33-room, 17-year-old mansion, 
which has an indoor/outdoor swimming pool as well as racquetball/handball and 
tennis courts, a golf green, a gym, spa, sauna and a shuffleboard court. The 
buyer was David Dunn, a longtime La Jolla resident and chairman of Prime 
Computer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was the $3.1-million-plus sale of an 8,365-square-foot home 
built in the '30s and extensively remodeled in 1973. That 1.5-acre property has 
fountains, tennis court and three wine cellars. It was owned by investor and 
former Las Vegas casino owner Allen Glick and was purchased by sports attorney 
Jeremy Kapstein.

AT HOME: IN MONTEBELLO, NEIGHBORS ARE VALUEDMIDDLE-CLASS, HEAVILY LATINO SUBURB 
WORKS, DESPITE NORTH-SOUTH DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As usual, the municipal golf course in Montebello was already crowded at 6:30 
a.m. one Saturday last month, as foursomes waited their turn at the starting 
tee. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen middle-aged men were waggling their clubs over the wet grass, 
chatting in Spanish. They were all correctly dressed for a municipal course, in 
mismatched slacks and sweaters. A young man bounded up to join them in a 
maroon-and-silver jogging suit, with a cocksure smile and a set of gleaming 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
It grew quiet as he was introduced to his partners. Golfers, especially golfers 
about to tee off, are apt to inspect one another for signs of overconfidence, 
the better to gloat over later as the course drags one and all down to their 
true level. This young man was being inspected for all he was worth, but he 
didn't seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
But then, as he was being introduced by a man whom he slightly resembled, an 
uncle or perhaps his father, something about him quickly changed. The young man 
stood in the perfect pose of humility, stooped, eyes lowered, his hands at his 
sides. He was showing respect. 
</P>
<P>
Conversation resumed. 
</P>
<P>
That's as good an anecdote as any to illustrate the spirit of Montebello. A 
bedrock middle-class community near East Los Angeles, between Monterey Park to 
the north and Downey to the south, Montebello has a firm grip on 
respectability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flame at Memorial 
</P>
<P>
The city's varied institutions are in working order. At City Park, the flame at 
the Veterans Memorial is lit and the ballpark smooth and green. Another of the 
city's five parks was named after a cop. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the public schools of the local district, the city is served by the 
Catholic diocese, which maintains two high schools and a trade college. The 
Armenian Orthodox Church has raised a new cathedral. Rod's, the venerable 
coffee shop on Garfield Avenue, serves homey cinnamon toast. Tianguis, the 
Latino supermarket, sells 10-pound bags of chickens' feet and fresh tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello, heavily but not predominantly Latino, figures in California history 
as the site of Mission Vieja, founded in 1771, forerunner of the prosperous 
Mission San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The Taylor Ranch, active early in this century, became the city's locus. The 
sprawling yellow ranch house is now part of a park, and one of its outbuildings 
is an "art barn" where children learn painting and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
In its own right, the city is rare for a suburb in having a long- established 
industrial base. It is an important trucking center, virtually surrounded by 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named After Slope 
</P>
<P>
What is not so rare for a small town is its set of longstanding feuds and 
divisions. Residents sometimes speak of South Montebello and North Montebello 
in tones that bring to mind the Union and Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
South of Whittier Boulevard are trucking yards and flat, gridded neighborhoods 
of postwar housing. North is the sunny slope from which the city took its name 
in 1880s ("Beautiful Mountain" in Italian). On this slope are custom houses and 
the new Montebello Plaza shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city's redevelopment agency proposed to buy out 23 householders 
in South Montebello and replace 444 trucking lots with a new, revenue-producing 
industrial park and perhaps another mall. 
</P>
<P>
Indignant, South Montebello arose and defeated the proposal in a citywide vote, 
and now residents clamor to replace the City Council members who put forth the 
offending plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Their Town 
</P>
<P>
Campaign rhetoric was sharp, but for the most part, it seems, the people of 
South Montebello still like their town well enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I ever had any ill-feeling toward North Montebello," said 
Alejandro Morales, a professor of Spanish at UC Irvine, who grew up on Espanol 
Street, in deepest South Montebello, on a bluff overlooking Simon's Brick 
Factory. 
</P>
<P>
"North Montebello was part of the outside world," he recalled. "It was there to 
be conquered." 
</P>
<P>
The brick factory, which closed in 1952, was Morales' world. His father and 
uncle were among the thousands of Mexicans imported from the state of 
Guanajuato to work and live in the factory compound, which had its own store, 
pool hall, school, church and baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
When the factory closed, Morales and hundreds of children like him were 
integrated into the English-speaking schools of Montebello. Morales says he had 
his run-ins with a few teachers, but fondly remembers many others. They helped 
train him well enough to later write a novel, "The Brick People," about the 
factory and its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remembered Flowers 
</P>
<P>
Another product of the Montebello Unified School District is 36-year-old David 
Velasquez, a municipal court judge in South Laguna Beach. His parents, Gil and 
Della Velasquez, moved to South Montebello in 1949, buying an $11,000 house on 
South Taylor Street with a GI loan. 
</P>
<P>
Della Velasquez, who grew up near downtown Los Angeles, had visited Montebello 
many times as a girl, and remembered its hills being covered with flowers, for 
the city's most visible business then was agriculture. It was a place of fig 
orchards and plantations of roses and birds of paradise. (Oil derricks, during 
the 1920s, had already sprouted on the higher slopes of the North Montebello 
hills.) 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered all the fun times I had when I used to visit here, and that's why 
I wanted to return," she said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Gil was a steelworker who came to own a construction business. As he prospered, 
he saw his neighbors on South Taylor move to more expensive houses in North 
Montebello, and eventually he followed them. Not without misgivings. Della did 
not want to move. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved my neighbors," she said with great feeling. "It was the house where we 
lived when the children were born. That kind of place is always special." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was Now or Never' 
</P>
<P>
But Gil watched one neighbor, the police chief, move to a new tract on the hill 
where a fig orchard had been, and then another, the city fire chief, moved up 
there as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a lot of money," he said of the $61,000 house he wanted, "but I 
knew I could afford it, and in a way, I figured, it was now or never." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a good-faith check and gave it to his realtor. Then he talked to his 
wife and had to ask the realtor to return the check. Then he decided he 
couldn't pass the chance to move up in the world, and tendered the check again. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while of going back and forth, that check started to look like an old 
dollar bill," he said, retelling the story. "Finally, my realtor said, 'I'm 
keeping this check, and you are buying this house.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the Velasquezes moved to their present house on North 19th Street, 
about halfway up the hill. They have noticed that people in the new 
neighborhood, though friendly, keep to themselves more and have fewer children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right Decision' 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood seems also more mixed, with Japanese, Armenian and Hungarian 
families around them. Without a doubt it is more prosperous: houses today sell 
for about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the right decision," Della said of the move. She has realized that they 
never completely left South Montebello. They still see their old friends at St. 
Benedict's Church. "Our kids were baptized, confirmed and married there," Gil 
said. "We know every person in the place." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Montebello is still a small town. One runs into neighbors at the 
supermarket, the mall or at Rod's. When a visitor was telling Gil Velasquez 
about the author Alejandro Morales, Velasquez said, "I remember that kid. Used 
to be in the neighborhood."

SPEAKING OUT: A BOND WITH THOSE WHO COME AFTER US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA COOK, The Christian Science Monitor: Distributed by the Los Angeles 
Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we first moved into our turn-of-the-century house -- my first house, 
actually -- and started the endless process of getting it into shape, it was 
discouraging to discover that while the original structure was remarkably solid 
and well-built, most of what had been changed or added over the years had been 
done poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Bad plumbing, shoddy electrical work and careless carpentry greeted us at every 
turn. In most instances cheap materials had been used, and fixtures improperly 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the day that water started flowing from the kitchen ceiling. We 
weren't certain which fixture upstairs was responsible until one day a guest 
took a fragrant-pine bath. 
</P>
<P>
As I watched the green water dripping into a bowl on my kitchen counter, and 
smelled the pine mingling with the garlic and herbs in my potage as it simmered 
on the stove, I wondered what sort of horror we were about to uncover. How 
could the bathtub be draining into the kitchen? 
</P>
<P>
The explanation was quite simple: the trap had been improperly located under 
the tub. It had rotted out and needed to be replaced. But to reach it, half the 
bathroom and a chunk of the kitchen ceiling had to be torn out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Did They Skimp? 
</P>
<P>
We decided that we might as well have the entire bathroom remodeled. As we 
began to plan for this work, we again asked ourselves the question we had 
already asked so often: 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't the effort made to do the job properly at the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
One probable answer was that doing the job right would have required additional 
outlays of time and money. And if the quality of the work in the house had been 
adequate for the lifetime of the people who had done the work, why should they 
have bothered with additional time and cost? 
</P>
<P>
As we gradually transformed our home over 10 years, the question of how the 
work should be done arose over and over. Each time we had to make a decision, 
we faced the same issue: 
</P>
<P>
How far beyond our own life span -- or house span -- should we be thinking? 
</P>
<P>
It would have been easier not to think about what we would be leaving behind 
for the people coming after us. But our own frustration at what we were finding 
made us determined to do everything the best way we could and to spend some 
extra money, if need be, to give our unknown friends-of-the-future something of 
value to work with, and work in. 
</P>
<P>
We also took stock of our landscaping attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow-Growing Trees 
</P>
<P>
I had wanted to plant fast-growing trees and shrubs, although I knew that the 
faster they grow, the shorter their life span. I was thinking only of myself. 
They certainly would have lasted long enough to give me pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
It took some reassessing of my own values before I saw the importance of 
planting slow-growing trees. Now I love the idea. And when I walk around my 
suburban neighborhood, I think often of my debt to those who, long ago, planted 
the majestic, slow-growing trees whose branches are like arms of friendship 
reaching across the generations. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, I asked myself why people should want to think of, or live 
for, those coming after them. I wondered what would persuade someone to do 
this. I asked myself how I would define the feelings I have now that make me 
want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Implausible as it may seem, I think it is the feeling of "parenting." 
</P>
<P>
When people have children, they always want to build for the children's future. 
They save and plan and do all in their power to make sure that their children 
are provided for. They care for their worldly goods so that they can pass them 
on intact, they care for the wisdom of generations so that their children will 
not forget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Will Inherit 
</P>
<P>
They do this because they love their children, and it is in the nature of love 
to stretch and transcend limits. I think that those who come after us are, in a 
very real sense, our children. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of human beings and creatures who have not yet made their 
appearance in the world will be inheriting from us. So clearly, the edge of the 
family circle can't be defined by time and space. Its circumference transcends 
all boundaries of past and future. 
</P>
<P>
We are so deeply indebted to past generations that we can't afford not to be 
deeply aware of those coming along after us. How much do we love them, what are 
we leaving them? Are we building the "house" well? 
</P>
<P>
Having said all this, there is one thing we did to our house that may, I fear, 
never be forgiven. We took up the oak floor in the hall and dining room in 
order to lay a classic, English-style black-and-white checkerboard floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see them now," I said to my husband, "standing here wringing their 
hands, moaning about how nobody in his right mind would rip our oak flooring to 
lay vinyl. Maybe we shouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Placed a Letter 
</P>
<P>
John reminded me that this was our house, our work of art. And I reminded 
myself of the difference between technical excellence and original style -- 
reminded myself that one of the most vital ideas we can ever pass to our 
"children" is that of the sanctity of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the installer came to lay the tiles, I gave him an envelope, 
and he obediently inserted it under one of the tiles in the dining room. It is 
a letter addressed to whomever tears out the black-and-white floor. 
</P>
<P>
It is both a greeting and an apology from their friends from the past, begging 
their indulgence for our one greatest liberty with "their" house. And 
expressing regret that they obviously hadn't liked what we had done. 
</P>
<P>
But at least they will know we were thinking of them, and that we cared.

TOUGH PERENNIAL WITH A LOT OF WANDERLUST; 
</P>
<P>
VERBENA RIGIDA IS A STRONG SURVIVOR THAT CAN BE PLANTED NEAR AND AROUND 
WALKWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Times Garden Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though I love nothing better than trying something new, there are a few plants 
in my own garden that I could not live without. They are not the biggest or the 
prettiest, but fill some role that is indispensable. The best example is a 
tough little perennial named Verbena rigida. 
</P>
<P>
Rigida refers to the sturdy stems and leaves that are almost abrasive and are 
strong enough to survive an occasional collision with a dog or cat or even 
getting stepped on by the gardener himself. I find it tough enough to grow in 
and around paths, although it decides precisely where. 
</P>
<P>
Like many perennials this one spreads on tuberous roots that travel just 
beneath the soil, never venturing so deep as to be irretrievable. In fact, 
should it get a little out of hand, it can be pulled out with a simple tug. 
</P>
<P>
During 10 years in my garden, it has spread slowly. It is a true wanderer, 
seldom appearing in the same place in succeeding years. It can find it's way 
into the middle of other plants and has even ventured into the lawn where it 
gets mowed with the grass, but most of it grows in open ground or between 
stepping stones. I do not consider it a pest because it has only a few leaves 
-- on just a few stems -- so does not overwhelm even the daintiest of plants. 
It only grows about a foot to 18 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blooms When Others Don't 
</P>
<P>
It blooms most of summer and fall but it is in late spring and early summer 
that it is so indispensable -- after the burst of spring flowers have faded -- 
but before summer has taken off. The garden can look quite bedraggled at this 
time of the year, with many things needing cutting back and with outright holes 
here and there where something has finished, but you would never notice because 
the brilliant pure purple of the verbena steals the show. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a lovely variety with soft lilac flowers, appropriately named 
'Lilacina', but it does not have nearly the impact. Mix the two for a little 
variety. It also seems less rambunctious, though I haven't grown it as long. 
The plain purple Verbena rigida is so at home in gardens, that it apparently 
has naturalized in parts of the South. It is native to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
That it has naturalized in the South suggests that it likes water, and it does, 
but it also can survive drought. It needs little other care. When the flowers 
are finished, simply cut the stems all the way to the ground, remembering that 
it will not come back in that spot but a few inches away in fresh ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not to Be Confused 
</P>
<P>
There is one trick worth mentioning: The leaves that are left in the fall will 
make poor flowers next summer, and look pretty ratty all winter, so they are 
best cut completely off. The plant will survive underground. 
</P>
<P>
I would have hesitated even mentioning this plant a few years ago because it 
was so scarce at nurseries, but now it has become widely available, though you 
may not find it at the first nursery you try. Roger's Gardens in Corona del 
Mar, Armstrong and Southern California Nursery in West Los Angeles, Burkards in 
Pasadena and Sperling in Calabasas are several sure sources. 
</P>
<P>
This verbena, by the way, should not be confused with more common ground 
covering Verbena peruviana. The latter makes a fast, flat mat spreading three 
or more feet. This is also a fine plant, blooming mostly in summer. It is not 
as tough, or as airy as Verbena rigida but is a more substantial plant and 
unexcelled in the hot interior and desert climates. There are also similar 
verbenas (called "garden verbenas," or Verbena hybrida that are grown as 
annuals.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: PURIFICATION SYSTEM FOR POOLS SAVES CHEMICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I spend a lot each year for the chemicals to treat my swimming pool. 
Will those new (no chemicals) ionization pool purification systems really work 
and do they use much electricity? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: An ionization pool water purification system can reduce the amount of 
chlorine and other chemicals you need by more than 90%. It uses only several 
dollars worth of electricity per swimming season. 
</P>
<P>
Using minerals, silver and copper, to purify water is an ancient process. Even 
in extremely low concentrations, silver kills bacteria. Copper, in the same low 
concentrations, stops the growth of algae. The concentrations are lower than in 
many types of natural mineral drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
An ionization water purifier uses two electrodes that are made primarily of 
copper and silver. When a low-voltage electrical current is passed between the 
electrodes, copper and silver ions are given off into the swimming pool water. 
There isn't any danger from this very low voltage. 
</P>
<P>
You can easily install a purification unit yourself. The special electrodes are 
housed in a small bowl-shaped tank with inlet and outlet pipe flanges. These 
attach to the piping outside your pool. You will still need the filtering 
system to remove dirt. You can wire it so that the purifier comes on when the 
pump starts. 
</P>
<P>
The purification system has an electronic control unit that adjusts the 
concentration level of the copper and silver ions in the pool water. You use a 
simple test kit, included with the system, to check the concentration level 
until you find the proper adjustment for your pool. 
</P>
<P>
When you first install the ionization system, you still have to use some 
chlorine and chemicals until the ion concentrations get to an adequate level. 
Then, a couple of times each swimming season, you should add some standard 
chemicals for a quick treatment of the pool water. 
</P>
<P>
Other than couple of cents per day for the electricity to operate the unit, 
your only expense is the replacement of the electrodes about every three to 
five years. They come in a set with new gaskets and you can replace them 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 261 showing a product 
description sheet, operating and water testing instructions, and a list of 
manufacturers of ionization pool purification systems. Please include $1 and a 
self-addressed envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles 
Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. 
</P>
<P>
Can Air Conditioner Operate With Timer? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I put my window air conditioner in again. I know it saves electricity to 
turn it off when I leave. Can I plug my air conditioner into the timer that I 
use for my lights and have it come on before I get home? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your idea of using a timer to control your air conditioner is good. It is 
similar to using an automatic setback furnace thermostat during the winter and 
it would cut your air-conditioning costs. 
</P>
<P>
However, you shouldn't try to use a standard lighting-type of timer for an air 
conditioner. The electricity drawn by an air conditioner, even a small window 
unit, is substantially more than for lights. A timer for lights is usually not 
designed to handle that much electric current. 
</P>
<P>
You will need to purchase a timer that is rated at least for a 15-amp current 
load. Several companies make heavy-duty electrical timers for air conditioner 
use. Check at a hardware, home center or electrical dealer.

HOW TO CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT BEDROOM CLOSET; 
</P>
<P>
WITH INGENUITY, WASTED SPACE CAN BE CONVERTED TO ADDITIONAL HANGER AND SHELF 
STORAGE.

<P>
A conventional bedroom closet with a single clothes rod and an upper shelf can 
quickly become overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
With a little work and ingenuity, however, it can often be revamped to hold the 
contents more efficiently. Here are a few principles of closet redesign: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Single rods at the standard 6-foot height are necessary for women's dresses 
but wasteful for most men's and children's wear. By installing bilevel rods you 
can double storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A narrow case with open shelves from floor to ceiling can house folded 
items, shoes, hats and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shelves above the clothes rods add valuable storage space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remove Existing Fixtures 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to go about installing additional rods, shelves and an open case. 
Remember to start any closet revamping by removing all existing rods and 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need three-quarters-inch plywood, 1-by-2 and 1-by-4 lumber, 1-inch 
hardwood dowels, dowel sockets, shelf edge moldings, L-brackets, screws and 
nails. Quantities and sizes will depend on the dimensions of your closet. The 
basic tools you'll require are saw, hammer, screwdriver, drill, drill bits and 
carpenter's level. 
</P>
<P>
The sides of the accessory case are made of plywood and extend from floor to 
ceiling. Place the good face of the plywood outward (facing the clothing) and 
fasten it at the floor, wall and ceiling with steel L-brackets. Try to line up 
the wall and ceiling brackets with the studs, or use hollow wall fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the shelves about one-sixteenth-inch shorter than the space between the 
uprights. Cut the shelf cleats that support the shelves from 1-by-2 stock and 
fasten them to the inside of the case sides. Use screws rather than nails for 
greater strength. 
</P>
<P>
The shelves can rest on the cleats or if you prefer pull-out shelves, add 
another cleat above the shelf. Leave enough clearance for the shelf to move in 
and out easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounting New Rods 
</P>
<P>
For clothes rods use 1-inch wood dowels. Mount each rod in metal clothes-rod 
sockets which are fixed to 1-by-4 cleats. Mount each socket so that its center 
is 11 inches from the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
If a shelf will rest on the cleats holding a dowel, place the dowel sockets 
near the bottom of the cleats. This will allow clearance above the rod to 
manipulate the hangers. To make sure that the rod is straight, install a socket 
at one end, insert the rod and place a level on it to determine the exact 
position for the socket at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
Shelves can be up to 22 inches deep. Shelves above the height of the closet 
door may have to be shallower to allow easy access. 
</P>
<P>
Use three-quarters-inch plywood for the shelves. Mount them on 1-by-2 cleats. 
Secure all wall cleats to studs. 
</P>
<P>
Finish exposed plywood edges with one-quarter-inch-thick shelf edge molding 
fastened with glue and brads. The molding conceals the raw edge of the plywood 
and eliminates the possibility of splinters.

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: BEST TO STICK WITH WATERPROOF GLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I glued together some furniture several months ago and it was fine, 
but recently some water got into the extra room in our house and some of the 
joints got loose. I had bought the glue under the impression that it was 
waterproof. Are they permitted to sell an adhesive as waterproof when it really 
isn't? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No, but the chances are that the glue was called water-resistant and 
not waterproof. There is a difference. An adhesive that is water-resistant is 
just that. It will resist high humidity and a limited amount of water, but 
waterproof material will stay glued when attacked by water. When you purchase 
glue that must be waterproof to meet your needs, make sure it says waterproof 
on the label of the container. Manufacturers are careful not to call a product 
waterproof when it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
How to Straighten a Warped Wood Panel 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a large panel of wood that was not used for a long time and became 
warped. What causes this, and how can it be corrected? 
</P>
<P>
A: The usual cause, although by no means the only one, is when moisture on one 
side of the wood is greater than on the other. What you should do is find out 
which side is dry. Apply some moisture to that side. Place the wood on wet 
grass or damp towels so that it will be in the hot sun most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The cupped side of the wood should be face down. Put some weights on the top of 
the wood -- perhaps a few books, but not too many or the weight will be too 
heavy. Examine the piece of wood at least once a day and remove it when the 
wood appears to be straight. 
</P>
<P>
Insulation Blankets Fine for Heating Ducts 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to insulate the heating ducts in our basement. They are used 
only for heating, not for air conditioning. Can I use the regular type of 
insulation, that is, the blankets? The ducts are the round type. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, the blankets are fine for heating ducts. Tell your dealer what they are 
being used for, and he will give you the kind that has no vapor barrier. Vapor 
barriers are not required when the blankets are used for this purpose. Also, 
tell the dealer you have round ducts, since many are shaped like a rectangle. 
The insulation will come with complete instructions for their use. 
</P>
<P>
Do-It-Yourselfer Can Hang Dropped Ceiling 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will a suspended ceiling cover the irregularities in the ceiling of the room 
where it will be installed? I have put up ceiling tiles in the past but have 
never tackled a suspended ceiling. Can it be handled by a do-it-yourselfer or 
must one be a professional? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you installed ceiling tiles, you should have no trouble with a suspended 
ceiling. It generally is considered easier. Just take your time and 
double-check everything before you go on to the next step. 
</P>
<P>
All aspects of painting a house are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Paint 
Your House Inside and Out," which can be obtained by sending $1 and a long,

COMMERCIAL SCENE: ASAHI JOINS CUSHMAN IN LONG BEACH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A February, 1991, completion date is projected for the $100-million, 26-story 
Landmark Square in Long Beach, the first co-development in the United States by 
Tokyo-based Asahi Development (USA) Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman Investment &amp; Development Corp. is the general partner and Asahi 
Development is the limited partner of the 436,000-square-foot building under 
construction in the block bounded by Pacific Avenue, 1st Street, Pine Avenue 
and Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach's downtown redevelopment area. John C. 
Cushman III of Cushman Investment &amp; Development said that such partnerships 
are the latest stage in Japanese development in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, Japanese investors purchased trophy properties -- 
high-visibility, institutional-quality buildings -- in major downtown financial 
centers," he said. "Due to a shortage of these buildings and -- more 
importantly -- an increasing awareness by Japanese investors of U.S. real 
estate practices, they are joining hands with established companies and 
developing real estate." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is the fifth largest city in California, but it is fourth in 
Japanese real estate investment in the entire nation, behind Honolulu, New York 
and Los Angeles, according to David J. Churton, director of marketing and 
leasing at Cushman. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese investors consider Long Beach, with its huge port complex, new World 
Trade Center, Long Beach Convention Center and world-class hotels, to be a 
major gateway to the Pacific Rim," Churton said. "They also like Long Beach 
because it is virtually the only pro-growth city in the Southland." 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the Landau Partnership, Santa Monica, Landmark Square will be clad 
with red and salmon granite, along with light-blue reflective glass, outlined 
with gray granite. Turner Construction Co. is the general contractor. 
Construction financing is by Bank of America and BOT Leasing America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The building will have 23,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor, 
with typical office floors averaging 18,500 square feet with eight corner 
offices and column-free space. Churton said the project will have 1,373 parking 
spaces in four underground levels and five above-ground ones.

TOWER SPURS BUSINESS GOAL OF WEST COVINA; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH-RISE COMPLETION SEEN AS MAJOR STEP TO DRAW FIRMS TO EASTERN SAN GABRIEL 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Covina wants to become to the eastern end of the San Gabriel Valley what 
Pasadena is to the western end: the major business center. The completion of 
the 13-story Eastland Tower brings West Covina's dream a step closer to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Valued at more than $40-million, the 13-story office building at 100 N. 
Barranca St., just north of the San Bernardino (10) Freeway, was designed to 
attract the kind of tenants that would normally go 20 miles west to downtown 
Los Angeles, according to Ziad Alhassen, president of Hassen Development Co., 
the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"We offer the amenities of a Class A building at half the rental rates of 
downtown or Century City ($1.35 per square foot per month compared to $2.50 and 
up) along with 700 free parking spaces on four underground levels," Alhassen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the 232,000-square-foot Eastland Tower brings the total office 
space in the city of 95,000 to about 912,000 square feet -- well below the 
inventory of 6 million square feet in Pasadena -- and marks the culmination of 
a five-year program to establish West Covina as the business center of the 
eastern San Gabriel Valley, according to Mayor Robert L. Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
"This building promises jobs for our residents, revenue to our city far in 
excess of the assistance given the developer and it sets the level of quality 
we will expect for all future developments," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen said that the tower is about 40% leased, with major tenants including 
Southwestern Portland Cement, Computer Entry Systems, Moore Business Forms, the 
Foothill Transit Zone, Perry Maloff Professional Corp. and Hassen Development. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the Southwestern Portland Cement move from mid-Wilshire was to 
be closer to its employees: About 80% of them live in eastern Los Angeles 
County or western San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Michele Wittig, a Mira Loma resident who has cut her commuting 
time from two hours or more to about 40 minutes, and Josie Calvero of Diamond 
Bar, who has reduced her driving time from 90 minutes to less than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Langdon Wilson Mumper, Los Angeles, the stair-stepped 
granite-and-reflective-glass-clad building is the tallest building in the 
eastern San Gabriel Valley. It is an "intelligent" office building, with 
computers controlling heating, air conditioning, ventilation, 
telecommunications and security, according to Asad Kahn of Langdon Wilson 
Mumper. 
</P>
<P>
The building is in the Eastland Redevelopment Area, formed in 1975 with 130 
acres adjacent to and including the 32-year-old Eastland Shopping Center, 
according to Chester Yoshizaki, West Covina's redevelopment manager.

"Over the next five to seven years, we expect to see construction of an 
additional 600,000 square feet of office space in West Covina in the Eastland 
Redevelopment Area and in the Central Business District redevelopment area," 
Yoshizaki said. The 560-acre CBD area was established in 1971, centering on 
Vincent Avenue and the freeway, including the West Covina Fashion Plaza and the 
Civic Center, he said.

CAMBODIAN WOMEN'S VISION LOSS LINKED TO SIGHTS OF SLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eang Long cried for many days after the Khmer Rouge soldier beat her brother 
and his three children to death. She vividly recalls how the soldier threw the 
youngest child, a 3-month-old, against a tree until the baby died. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyesight started to get terrible after I saw the tragedy," Long said. 
"Because I was crying so hard and long, my eyes were red and started to swell 
up. Then I started to have problems with my eyesight." 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Long, 65, who now lives in Long Beach, still has days when 
shadows -- like silent phantoms of the past -- obscure her vision. She says her 
bifocals do not always help and she fears her eyesight will get worse. 
</P>
<P>
Long and dozens of other middle-aged Cambodian women are coping with a 
condition that some researchers have called "functional blindness" -- blindness 
or visual problems caused by psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
Two researchers who have studied the condition say it is linked to post-war 
trauma stemming from the genocide by Communist leader Pol Pot and the Khmer 
Rouge in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Gretchen Van Boemel, associate director of clinical electro-physiology at the 
Doheny Eye Institute in Los Angeles, says it was 1984 when she started to 
notice a disproportionate number of Cambodian women in the 40 to 60 age group 
who had the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked about this with a friend who was involved in Southeast Asian 
affairs," Van Boemel said, "and she described all the atrocities and killing 
fields in Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, Van Boemel contacted her friend and former college 
classmate Patricia Rozee-Koker, now a psychology professor at Cal State Long 
Beach. By 1985 the two researchers had located a group of 30 Cambodian women, 
ages 40 to 69, who volunteered to be in a study. All of the women had lived in 
Cambodia during the Pol Pot regime and later spent one to six years in a Thai 
refugee camp before being relocated to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Van Boemel said the purpose of the survey was to show that "a psychological 
overlay was causing the women's eye problems, even if the brain was functioning 
normally." 
</P>
<P>
Each woman was interviewed and given an eye exam and a test to determine 
whether the visual system in the brain is functioning normally. Van Boemel said 
the test monitors brain waves as subjects look at checked patterns on a video 
monitor. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the test revealed normal visual acuity, often at the 20/20 or 
20/40 level. These same women, however, when looking at an eye chart could 
barely see the top line of 20/200 -- the point of legal blindness. Other women 
had no light perception and could not detect light or dark shadows. 
</P>
<P>
Rozee-Koker said most of the women's functional blindness surfaced during the 
Pol Pot years. Personal interviews brought out repeated stories of forced 
labor, the murder of family and friends -- often in their presence -- beating 
and torture, starvation, a treacherous escape to Thailand and separation from 
family. She said the findings indicated that the longer a woman was bound to 
Khmer Rouge servitude or life in a refugee camp, the more her vision was 
impaired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reports Received Attention 
</P>
<P>
Results of the study were presented at the 1986 American Psychological Assn. 
annual meeting in Washington. There was only one other paper about Cambodian 
refugee women and both reports received considerable attention. The paper, "The 
Psychological Effects of War Trauma and Abuse on Older Cambodian Refugee Women" 
is scheduled to appear in a coming issue of the journal, "Women and Therapy." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the Cambodians do not always understand their 
condition and that many optometrists and ophthalmologists dismiss the vision 
loss as a case of "faking" or "malingering," Van Boemel said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Rozee-Koker pointed to a 1985 piece in the journal 
Ophthalmology. It described new immigrants who might be milking the welfare 
system with complaints of functional blindness. "That article was racist," 
Rozee-Koker said. "But people believe it. It was very insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Nelson, a third-year resident at the UCLA School of Medicine, recently 
completed a preliminary study of Cambodians with functional blindness. "We 
found some patients who had been considered malingerers," he said. "But our 
research proved this to be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexplainable Problems 
</P>
<P>
His findings were confirmed by Long Beach ophthalmologist Hector Sulit, who in 
the last five years has noticed a significant number of Cambodian women with 
unexplainable visual problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it has anything to do with their age, but because they lost 
family or children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As more data about functional blindness in the Cambodian community became 
available, Rozee-Koker and Van Boemel decided to continue their study. 
</P>
<P>
This fall they completed a 10-week study of 15 Long Beach Cambodian women. Each 
Saturday the women participated in a therapy or skills group for 90 minutes. 
The therapy group uncovered deep post-war trauma. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic improvement took place in the skills group. As the women 
mastered such basic skills as taking a bus downtown, using a telephone and 
shopping, they felt a growing sense of empowerment over their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Or as one Cambodian woman told Rozee-Koker: "When I am happy I see better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improvement in Vision 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing to see the difference," Rozee-Koker said. "From having to be 
guided by our arms into the elevator to the psychology building or holding 
themselves in a fetal position -- to the last week when they were standing up 
straight. Many could smile and with some, their vision improved." 
</P>
<P>
For Chhou Chreng, 64, the sessions were an opportunity to learn how to dial 911 
and to brush up on writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my vision in an accident in 1979," she said. "Something fell on my head 
and then things were not clear." Under Pol Pot she was forced to work in the 
rice fields for four years. Her husband, brother and many cousins died of 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I will get a headache if I think about my sister in Cambodia," she 
said. "Then I will get pain all over my body and my eyes will hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Both researchers, who are compiling their data, acknowledge that 10 weeks is 
not enough time to deal with these bouts of depression. Next year they hope to 
start a student intern program at Cal State Long Beach that will assist local 
Cambodian women. 
</P>
<P>
Another agency, the nonprofit Community Rehabilitation Industries, also works 
with Cambodian women. Konthea Kang, a program coordinator at CRI, estimates 
that up to 20% to 30% of the dozens of Cambodian women she sees have had visual 
loss symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Older women, she said, have a more difficult time assimilating into American 
life styles. In Cambodia, most young people take care of their elderly 
relatives and parents. In rural areas, she said, women stay at home and raise 
families and many urban husbands also frown upon wives who work. When these 
women reach the United States, they are strongly encouraged by federal and 
state agencies to find a job. But in the workplace, they encounter yet another 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When they can't speak English, they don't know what to do and get laid off," 
Kang said. "After this they feel lost for several months." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tormented by Nightmares 
</P>
<P>
As a counselor at the Asian Pacific Mental Health Center in Long Beach, the 
Rev. Kong Chhean said he tries to help his patients become more secure. The 
counselor and Buddhist monk has a caseload of about eight women with visual 
dysfunction symptoms. They are tormented by frequent nightmares about the Khmer 
Rouge and are afraid of attacks, even though they are half a globe away from 
the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Although light is being shed on functional blindness, experts say that 
successful treatment is often tied to mental health care and that poses a 
problem in the Cambodian community. 
</P>
<P>
Kung Chap, a vocational rehabilitation counselor at the Long Beach office of 
the California Department of Rehabilitation, said the concept of mental health 
care in Cambodia is negative. A mental health facility in Phnom Penh called 
Takhmao Hospital "looks like a jail," he said. "The people there are labeled as 
crazy people. They would have been beaten and electric shock used on them." 
</P>
<P>
Cambodians, Chap said, would rather seek help from the family, a temple or a 
shaman with magic cures. They are slow to accept the American-style of 
counseling and therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Rozee-Koker and Van Boemel have also found Cambodians to be afraid of agencies, 
hospitals and the university. On one occasion they made an appointment to 
interview a woman and her family. When they got to the house, the entire family 
had picked up and moved. 
</P>
<P>
"We had evoked memories of the Khmer Rouge," Rozee-Koker said. "To them it was 
a voice of authority. To their minds it sounded like Pol Pot." 
</P>
<P>
The refugees, Rozee-Koker said, will carry the scars of their experiences 
throughout their lives. "They do not want to see any more violence, any more 
pain. They have essentially closed their eyes to it." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Chhou Chreng put, it, "When I feel happy my eyes are normal. When I 
think about Cambodia and my family I see flashes of light and dark."

<P>
It looks as if Mayor Eugene F. Moses will soon test the adage, "You can't fight 
City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
The city has begun public nuisance proceedings against Moses over a 2.5-acre 
Western theme park, which he began building at the mouth of the San Gabriel 
Canyon in the 1970s, but never completed or opened. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks, there is to be an administrative hearing on alleged Municipal 
Code violations at Canyon City Ghost Town. If the city's hearing officer rules 
against Moses, the mayor can appeal the matter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the mayor may have to raze all buildings on the property to comply 
with the code. 
</P>
<P>
According to city staff, the ghost town lacks required use and building 
permits, adequate parking and landscaping, and proper storage facilities for 
materials on the site. It is also in a generally dilapidated state, according 
to a "notice of violations and request for corrections" sent to Moses in March. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city code, a property owner who does not correct such violations 
would be guilty of a misdemeanor. To comply, Moses was to have bulldozed the 
town or to have submitted a new precise plan for the property by last Thursday. 
Before approving such a plan, the city could require a list of extensive and 
costly repairs. 
</P>
<P>
To date, no updated plans are on file, and Moses said he has no intention of 
tearing down the ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
Moses, arguing that the site does not injure the public or the city's image, 
accused City Council rivals Tony D. Naranjo and Harry L. Stemrich of 
instigating the action to hurt him politically. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears I've been the target of personal vendettas of two council members 
because of my political beliefs," Moses said. "It's not fair for them to do 
what they're doing to me." 
</P>
<P>
Moses said he has received an attorney's advice that his property is a "legal, 
nonconforming use" approved by the county before the land was annexed by the 
city in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Council Action 
</P>
<P>
Naranjo and Stemrich denied they initiated the action against Moses, saying 
that in April the entire City Council told city staff to aggressively pursue 
all such violations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We said there would be no exceptions for anybody," Naranjo said. "How do we go 
out in the community and tell people you have to fix yours up, but we give 
council members special favors?" 
</P>
<P>
Naranjo noted that the city has recently pursued similar abatement procedures 
against former Councilman Lucio Cruz and the father of Councilman Bruce Latta, 
who were forced to tear down buildings deemed public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
"There are constant complaints about the ghost town," said Stemrich, who noted 
that the city has forced the demolition of 36 structures deemed public 
nuisances since last July. "He's no different than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Under city procedures, City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes will appoint a 
senior staff member to act as the hearing officer. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Moses has run afoul of local government. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1987, he fought an unsuccessful battle against the county Fire 
Department over the removal of weeds from the back yard of his hillside home. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving repeated warnings and a citation for the pace of his cleanup, 
Moses paid $1,000 for county agricultural workers to perform the work. The 
citation was eventually revoked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Canyon Site 
</P>
<P>
Originally intended as a smaller Knott's Berry Farm, Moses' property, at 1755 
N. San Gabriel Canyon Road, contains about 16 cabins, stores and shacks 
arranged to resemble an Old West town. There is also an assemblage of mostly 
authentic relics salvaged from as far away as Montana, Utah and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Moses has declined to estimate how much the construction has cost him over the 
years, but has said he did most of the labor himself. 
</P>
<P>
Among the town's relics are a complete blacksmith's shop, a horse-drawn fire 
wagon and pieces of Western memorabilia. However, at times, there have also 
been junk cars and scrap piles visible from San Gabriel Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The property was annexed by the city in 1974, about two years after the county 
gave preliminary approval for the ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, preliminary plans and building permits were approved, but 
they lapsed when the work wasn't completed on time, according to the violations 
notice, which was signed by Community Development Director Roy E. Bruckner and 
Community Improvement Manager David E. Rudisel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Permitted Uses' 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time there are no permitted uses on the property," the notice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are no valid permits, the buildings have been declared abandoned 
and, by legal definition, unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Moses attempted to sell the property, initiating a standard review 
of city records that is required under city ordinance, Rudisel said. That is 
when city officials discovered that no permits had been issued, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, upon hearing of Moses' intention to sell the property, Stemrich in 
January initiated a study on changing the zoning of all property north of 
Sierra Madre Boulevard to single-family residences. Stemrich said he was 
concerned an apartment or condominium project would go in on the property, 
currently zoned commercial-recreational. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoning on Hold 
</P>
<P>
Such zoning changes, which could make Moses's site much less valuable, have 
been put on hold. The property is north of Sierra Madre Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Moses, who said he did not know what the buyer planned for the site, has 
claimed that the sale was killed because of Stemrich's action. He has 
threatened to sue the city and individual council members. 
</P>
<P>
Temporary county and city permits and plan approvals expired when construction 
was not completed on time, according to the March memo to Moses. The mayor said 
he never finished construction because the city allowed a large condominium 
project to be built near his property, making an amusement park incompatible 
with residential uses. "The reason it was never finalized is that they rezoned 
it for condos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moses acknowledged that some parts of the ghost town are dilapidated. But he 
argued that, because it is not open to the public, it does not constitute a 
public nuisance.

'TEAR-DOWN FEVER' SPREADS ALONG COAST; 
</P>
<P>
ANALYSTS SAY RAZING SMALL HOMES TO MAKE WAY FOR BIG ONES IS CHANGING THE FACE 
OF MIDDLE-CLASS COMMUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years it has been a favorite practice of the rich. Buy a 
million-dollar home, knock it down, and build a multimillion-dollar home. Tear 
down a mansion and erect a palace. 
</P>
<P>
But the seven-figure status symbols are no longer limited to the best areas of 
Bel-Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills, Malibu and Pacific Palisades. "Tear-down 
fever" has spread throughout Los Angeles' coastal landscape, sweeping through 
one-time blue-collar communities that have become executive havens as the price 
of Westside real estate has shot skyward. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Don Bourquin, a Mar Vista resident for two decades. In the last year, 
half a dozen mini-mansions have risen up in his hillside neighborhood, 
monuments to escalating equity -- and often -- to bad taste. The explosion of 
small estates on lots once occupied by two-bedroom, one-bath homes is changing 
the face of other former middle-class communities, such as Venice, Westchester, 
Westside Village, Culver City and parts of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Full of Rabbits 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine that this was just a barren hill full of rabbits not long 
ago," Bourquin said. "But I guess this is progress." 
</P>
<P>
They have become such familiar sights in Westside neighborhoods that the 
neighbors can now spot the signs of the next arrival. First, the work crews 
show up, bearing construction gear. Then the scaffolding arrives. And then 
along comes the dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
"When the dumpster arrives, you know it's going to be big," said Bourquin. "You 
think at first they're just putting on a new roof because the shingles are 
gone. And then, all of a sudden, the rafters are gone. And then the next week, 
the house disappears." 
</P>
<P>
What replaces it, often to the dismay of nearby residents, is a house that 
usually fills every square foot of the lot and juts above other homes in the 
neighborhood. Some complain that the over-scaled homes destroy the character of 
the neighborhood; others note that it raises surrounding property values. 
Everyone agrees that it appears to be a trend without end. 
</P>
<P>
There are numerous explanations for the tear-down boom, including what one 
person called the "trickle-down theory of tear-downs," whereby the astronomical 
prices of homes in Bel-Air and environs has forced even affluent house shoppers 
to look in "more affordable" areas. Home buyers rich enough to be looking for 
four- and five-bedroom homes, but not rich enough for Beverly Hills, find that 
outside the exclusive neighborhoods, such homes are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
In parts of Beverly Hills, land often goes for more than $3 million an acre, 
and two-acre lots can sell for up to $10 million. By comparison, an older 
three-bedroom house in Westchester can be purchased for under $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
So, for an additional $300,000, a homeowner could build a new house of 3,000 
square feet that closely matches the value of the lot and their personal taste 
rather than spend more than $700,000 for a small fixer-upper in Pacific 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rise in Land Values 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we're seeing nice houses razed all over Los Angeles boils down to 
the escalation of land values in some communities," said Michael Salkin, an 
economist and senior vice president at First Interstate Bank. "In many 
instances, you have land that is worth up to $1 million per acre and a house 
that's not worth much at all. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start thinking about putting in a few walls, new air conditioning, a 
new bathroom and maybe adding a room, you look at the hard costs and you 
realize that, to put out that expenditure, you can build a new house." 
</P>
<P>
Salkin offers as an example any of the modest single-story homes in Mar Vista 
or Santa Monica, many under 1,500 square feet, where the lots are worth as much 
as $500,000. With the average construction cost of about $100 per square foot 
for a partial remodeling or a tear-down, he said it makes sense to demolish one 
home and build another. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want a $200,000 house sitting on a $500,000 lot," Salkin said. "So 
when you start talking numbers, you end up thinking, 'why not just rip the 
whole thing down, build a new house and call it a day?" 
</P>
<P>
Optimistic property owners are even building vertically, with high-tech 
structures in marginal Venice neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't have the courage for total tear-downs," said Venice real 
estate broker-developer Elaine Spierer. "But it's the only way people can buy a 
new, big house and avoid moving to Palmdale. " 
</P>
<P>
Spierer has done two tear-downs in her Windward Circle neighborhood, including 
a three-story structure that she and her partner recently sold to a well-known 
musician for $800,000. But when she was considering knocking down a dilapidated 
shack and building a modern home for herself near a busy street two years ago, 
she said her real estate colleagues thought she should seek counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed in it, but everyone else thought I was smoking something," she 
said. "The attitude was that we were way overbuilding for the area. But I think 
the new construction gives people new confidence about their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Buy Now and Dream' 
</P>
<P>
"When people have to buy into what is perceived to be a less prestigious area, 
they just have to believe that what they are doing to build a new house will 
make it wonderful later. It's so expensive that, in many cases, they have to 
buy a two-bedroom, one-bath house now and dream." 
</P>
<P>
The tear-down boom is influenced as much by a lack of available housing as by 
any impulse to build a dream house, said Don Doyle, president of California 
Development Co. in Santa Monica. He said that, unless the urbanized areas of 
the state can meet the exploding demand for housing, places like Los Angeles 
and San Francisco will just have to increase dwelling density or face continued 
soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
"People (who) live on the Westside and other parts of L.A. will either see a 
greater density or the housing prices will just skyrocket," he said. "But, 
until we build a wall around California or enforce a mandatory birth control 
program, we're going to have to start responding to our housing needs. The 
tear-down phenomenon is part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city building officials do not keep track of the total number of 
tear-downs. In fact, most of the tear-downs are listed as remodeling jobs 
because homeowners want to avoid the cost of seeking additional permits. By 
keeping one wall of the original home in place, a tear-down is considered a 
remodel, and property owners can reap some tax benefits and save up to $2 per 
square foot in permit costs, according to building officials and contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they can avoid costly delays and reams of red tape that await them 
at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubling Investment 
</P>
<P>
George Christopolous, a real estate agent with Jon Douglas Co., said that the 
tear-down trend has sparked an increase in the number of houses built on 
speculation by developers. Rather than just adding some remodeling touches to 
reap a profit on a house sale, he said they are doubling their investment by 
doubling the size of the house. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's Salkin said that those engaging in the tear-down craze, even 
on the Westside, have to be careful not to "over-improve" a property. He said 
the rebuilding trend would continue to be most popular in more expensive 
neighborhoods where there are lots of houses already worth more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he predicts that in the years to come, the largely unaffected areas of 
Los Angeles, such as the downtown neighborhoods, will see a lot more 
rebuilding. 
</P>

"Slowly but surely over time, the smaller and olders buildings get removed and 
they are replaced by newer and bigger buildings," he said. "You'll see it in 
Silver Lake, Koreatown and just about anywhere there is a great demand for 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perceptions Shifting 
</P>
<P>
Spierer, who sold a large house in Brentwood to build her dream home in Venice 
"so I could walk my dog and actually see people on the streets," said the 
demarcation line between "prestigious" neighborhoods and semi-affordable areas 
is being shifted by the tear-down craze. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is look around and you can see all these 1950 'war boxes' 
with a second story going up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bourquin, who has done some remodeling on his Mar Vista house, said he has no 
intention of keeping up with the Joneses or anyone else who decides to triple 
the size and increase the value of their home. Yet he said he is resigned to 
the prospect of his neighborhood soon being filled with more homes like the 
two-story brick, pseudo-Tudor mansion with the life-sized Gumby in the window, 
a few doors down from his Keeshen Drive house. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last 10 years the houses in the neighborhood were all the same, and 
then these things started appearing," he said. "I don't understand why 
everybody is rushing to build the next ostentatious house. But it's almost as 
if you're out of step if you don't do something major."

GROUPS, INDIVIDUALS ON LIST FOR PASADENA ARTS GRANTS 
</P>

City grants ranging from $22,500 for the Pasadena Playhouse to $2,870 for a 
12-year-old musician to $600 for a dance ensemble will be recommended by the 
city Arts Commission to the Pasadena Board of Directors June 13. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed awards, totaling $180,000, would go to six individuals and 23 
organizations based on their proposed projects and quality of work. This will 
be the first year the city has conducted a competition for arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
The city received applications from 32 artists and 41 organizations asking for 
a total of more than $1 million under the new Grants-in-Aid program, but has 
only $180,000 to award. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrie Braun Poole, chairman of the Arts Commission, said the awards process 
has raised a number of controversial issues, particularly including whether 
Pasadena should give money to arts organizations outside the city and whether 
students should be eligible for grants. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is recommending grants to a number of organizations outside 
Pasadena, such as the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles and the Huntington 
Library in San Marino, based on the service they provide to Pasadena residents. 
</P>
<P>
The commission based its recommendations on artistic appraisals made by a group 
of peer-review panels that studied funding applications and assessed their 
merit. 
</P>
<P>
Poole said the panels, consisting of artists, critics and others involved in 
the arts, were given few guidelines. The only instruction given to the panel 
and the applicants was, "Give us quality." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money is being recommended for established institutions, but some 
funds were allocated to help individual artists. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the commission is recommending that Gregory Jefferson, a 
12-year-old flutist, be given $2,870 to continue his musical training. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budding Career 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, Joann Jefferson, said that even though her son applied for 
$4,100, she is quite happy with any encouragement the city can offer her son's 
budding career, which has already included solo performances at the Hollywood 
Bowl. "I'm satisfied with any acknowledgement for him, whether it's $500 or 
$5,000," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Poole said there is no doubt that the youngster has exceptional talent, but the 
question that has been raised is whether grants should be made for educational 
purposes. When the program was being formulated, Poole said, "none of us 
considered that we would, in essence, be giving scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
In making its recommendations to the Board of Directors, the commission did not 
exclude any of the individual artists or organizations proposed for funding by 
its peer-review panels. But it did change the funding amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The panels had originally recommended grants totaling more than $250,000. This 
amount was pared to $180,000 by a committee of panelists by putting a cap of 
$10,000 on the top awards. The commission decided to remove the cap and apply 
proportional cuts instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Grants 
</P>
<P>
Three organizations, the Pasadena Playhouse, the Pasadena Symphony and the 
Pacific Asia Museum, received the highest possible ranking in the art panel 
evaluations. The commission recommended allocations of $22,500 each to the 
Pasadena Playhouse and the symphony and $9,000 to the Pacific Asia Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Other major proposed grants include $16,000 to the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra for concerts at Ambassador Auditorium; $10,500 to the Music Center 
Opera Assn. to bring 3,000 Pasadena children to the opera; $8,000 each to 
Kidspace to expand its ethnic arts festival and the Huntington Library for 
general operations; $7,500 to the Da Camera Society to present chamber music 
concerts at historic sites, including five in Pasadena, and $7,000 to the 
Southwest Museum for general operations. 
</P>
<P>
Other smaller grants would go toward an experimental art program for preschool 
children, create an art studio at Pasadena Alternative School, help support 
concerts in Pasadena by the Southwest Chamber Music Society and the Coleman 
Chamber Music Assn., and provide general support to the Pasadena Community 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Individual artists recommended for funding include Randall West, who proposes 
to produce a billboard and photographs of Pasadena; Richard Bunkall, who plans 
to create paintings, sculptures and drawings; Gifford Myers, who would create 
sculpture and other artworks; Milbre Burch, who would give storytelling 
performances for children and adults; and Sally Storch, who would create six 
paintings depicting city dwellers.

REDUCING THE ENEMY TO TEARS; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH PASADENANS LEARN TO USE THE ARSENAL IN AN AEROSOL CAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So that mean-looking AK-47 you had your eye on is suddenly hard to get. Try 
another kind of self-defense weapon, advises the South Pasadena Police 
Department. It works fast, it disables an assailant without killing or maiming, 
and it fits neatly into purse or pocket. 
</P>
<P>
It's tear gas, the bodyguard in an aerosol can. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people went to the South Pasadena City Council chambers on Wednesday 
night to learn about the user-friendly crystalline substance, which achieved 
fame (and some notoriety) when police departments started using it in the 1960s 
to help quell civil disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
California residents have been allowed to use tear-gas spray since 1977, 
provided users go through a state-certified two-hour training program and carry 
a state certificate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dab Will Do It 
</P>
<P>
The attendees, all but three of them women, watched a videotape, talked about 
when it was appropriate to use their aerosol cans, took "target practice," then 
-- the tearful climax of the evening -- took a whiff of the gas. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe in a product until you know it works," said Art Chance, one 
of a pair of retired sheriff's deputies who run classes on tear gas for the 
state-funded La Puente Valley Regional Occupation Program. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, gosh, it does burn," said Leticia Petot, a nurse from Alhambra, who had 
dutifully followed former Los Angeles County Deputy Van Bogardus out to the 
City Hall courtyard and lined up to have some tear gas dabbed under her eye 
with a cotton swab. 
</P>
<P>
Standing near Petot, fellow samplers looked stunned and teary-eyed at each 
other, fanned their faces, sneezed or rushed into restrooms to wash the stuff 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Petot compared the sensation to hot chili. Nurse Paula Lopez said it was more 
like an abrasion. "It feels like when you skinned your knee on the ground when 
you were a kid," said Lopez, pointing to a red spot on her cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
But for Mailan Nguyen, it was more like a sudden terrifying loss of sight. "I 
thought I was blind," said the Cal State L.A. marketing student, her face still 
wet from tears and tap water. "I guess my eyes are very sensitive. I can't even 
use eyeliner." 
</P>
<P>
There was some head-shaking by the trainees just because they were there. "It's 
a sad commentary on survival," said Jo Ann Semon, a Los Angeles Unified School 
District employee who has lived in South Pasadena for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Things are changing, said some, even in South Pasadena, whose residents pride 
themselves on the city's easygoing, small-town atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Simmons, a former City Council member who took the class, remembered when 
she moved to the city more than 25 years ago. "I used to leave my keys in the 
car, so I was ready to roll when I got out the door in the morning," said 
Simmons, who worked as a sheriff's deputy for 14 years. "I used to have to be 
at the Hall of Justice at 7 in the morning. In the mad rush, you didn't want to 
have to look for your keys." 
</P>
<P>
But major crimes -- especially auto thefts -- are on the upswing in the little 
city. Last year, there was a murder, three reported rapes and 30 aggravated 
assaults (up from no murders, no reported rapes and 24 assaults in 1987). Auto 
thefts catapulted from 134 to 210. 
</P>
<P>
sh 'Be Prepared' 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no city that's safe any more," said Semon. "I believe in the 
old Boy Scout adage, 'Be prepared.' " 
</P>
<P>
But before the trainees could purchase their own supplies ($19.18 for a 
tear-gas certificate, a 10-gram container of the stuff and a leather holder in 
"designer black or brown," as Chance put it), they had to listen to a few 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't use it on your husband or boyfriend," said Chance, a burly man with a 
crew cut, who served on a Los Angeles County Sheriff's SWAT team for 11 years. 
"It looks bad, and it's against the law -- unless he does something bad, of 
course." 
</P>
<P>
The training video added, to the merriment of the viewers, that spraying 
merchants who shortchange you or motorists who cut you off is also frowned on 
by law enforcement agencies (and punishable with a $1,000 fine and up to three 
years in jail). 
</P>
<P>
sh No Spraying Upwind 
</P>
<P>
And don't fire into the wind. "Some spray may come back at you," said the video 
narrator. 
</P>
<P>
They all got to hold a loaded aerosol can, with a non-Mace substance in it, and 
take a shot at a silhouette target, just like the ones in the police firing 
range. Bogardus suggested an aggressive stance, with one thumb on the trigger 
and the free hand ready to push. That was preferable to the "hair spray 
technique," with a forefinger pushing the can's release button, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the 30 new tear-gas users disappeared into the night, canisters clutched 
in their hands, newly confident in confronting the forces of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Who was to say they weren't all off to commit crimes with their new weapons? 
"We have no assurance that they're not felons," conceded Bogardus with a shrug. 
"But if they are, that's making out a false document." What happens then? 
"Their right to carry Mace would be revoked," he said.

1ST TENANT CHARGED UNDER W. HOLLYWOOD RENT CONTROL LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first criminal prosecution of a tenant under West Hollywood's tough rent 
control law, a man accused of lying to the Rent Stabilization Commission in an 
attempt to win a $25 rent reduction faces up to 12 years in prison and fines of 
up to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Gelvin, 33, who now lives in Los Angeles, is accused of preparing false 
documentary evidence, offering false documentary evidence and committing 
perjury under oath before the rent commission in 1987, when he lived in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the felony charges carries a maximum four years in prison and a $10,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleads Not Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin, who was released on $1,500 bail after his arrest last month, pleaded 
not guilty to the charges last Wednesday in Beverly Hills Municipal Court. A 
preliminary hearing has been set for June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin's lawyer, Charles R. English, called the charges brought by the district 
attorney's office, at the request of West Hollywood rent control officials, "a 
bit of overkill," and he accused city officials of trying to make an example of 
his client. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously the kind of prosecution that permits them to say they're being 
evenhanded," English said. "But given the potential penalties involved compared 
to what the accusations are, this case is a little bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, criminal prosecutions under the 4-year-old law have been aimed 
solely at landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Gelvin was singled out, the city's chief rent control officer said the 
case was "not unusual, other than the fact it is the first of its kind against 
a tenant." 
</P>
<P>
"The message here, if there is one, is that if you come to our (rent 
commission) hearings, you need to testify truthfully, regardless of whether 
you're a property manager, owner or tenant," said Richard Dorsey Muller, the 
city's rent stabilization director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought $25 Reduction 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Gelvin stem from a 1987 hearing before the rent commission 
at which he sought a $25 reduction of his $548-a-month rent, accusing his 
landlord of eliminating one of two parking spaces to which he was entitled. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord, Ashkenazy Management Co., contended that Gelvin's rent for the 
studio apartment at 949 Larrabee St., where he lived from March, 1983, until 
July, 1987, included use of only one parking space. 
</P>
<P>
After Gelvin presented several canceled checks with notations indicating that 
the rent payments were also for "extra parking," a hearing examiner reduced his 
rent by $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gelvin appealed the decision, insisting he was entitled to the $25 
decrease. 
</P>
<P>
During the appeal, a lawyer for the management company presented bank 
photocopies of the checks Gelvin had offered at the earlier hearing which did 
not contain the notations. The lawyer, Steven Weaver, claimed Gelvin entered 
the notations after the checks were cashed to make it appear he was paying for 
the extra parking space. The commission agreed and ruled in favor of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Gelvin declined to be interviewed, but English said his client "is obviously 
torn up by the potential consequences of something like this. . . . He's no 
criminal. He's more like the guy next door." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Gelvin case is the first criminal case against a tenant, at least 
two dozen West Hollywood landlords or their agents have been prosecuted since 
the law was enacted in 1985, all but one of them on misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a property manager was charged with two felonies after being accused 
of falsifying documents presented to the rent commission to obtain a rent 
increase for an apartment he managed. 
</P>
<P>
After pleading guilty to charges of perjury and offering a forged or altered 
document as genuine, E. (Budd) Kops, 69, was placed on probation for three 
years, ordered to pay the city $6,500 in costs and a fine of $3,500, and was 
placed under house arrest for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the prosecutions have occurred since last year, when West Hollywood -- 
where an estimated 85% of residents are renters -- hired a full-time 
enforcement officer as part of a new "get-tough" policy against rent control 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
Muller said the city has recovered more than $150,000 in unpaid registration 
fees, overcharged rents, fines and attorney's fees as a result of the 
prosecutions. The city has collected an additional $100,000 in fees from 
landlords who have come forward voluntarily as a result of the stepped up 
enforcement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Gelvin case, "just happens to be the first instance where an 
investigation has resulted in a prosecutable offense of this magnitude 
involving a tenant." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Hugh Bobys said the case against Gelvin is "unusual in that, 
as a matter of dollars and cents, the amount of loss to the landlord may not 
seem of great significance, and yet the potential penalties are extremely 
great. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it tells people that West Hollywood is very serious about prosecuting 
people accused of committing perjury or presenting false evidence in its (rent 
control) hearings," he said. "In that sense, it's sure to get people's 
attention."

SUIT AGAINST OFFICER IS AN 'AGGRAVATION'

Re: "Family Sues Police Officer Who Saved Woman" (Times, May 25).

<P>
This was a tragic situation, and I wouldn't put this to pen in such a flip 
manner, but Mr. (Lucius) Parkinson opened the door with his frivolous lawsuit 
against Officer Devin Chase. 
</P>
<P>
Using Mr. Parkinson's logic of finding someone to fault, he might want to blame 
himself and sue himself for not teaching his daughter common sense. Although 
this lawsuit will obviously be "tossed," it will probably still be in Officer 
Chase's head, an aggravation no cop needs, especially the next time he acts to 
save a life.

POMONA COUNCIL CUTS 3 CITY POSTS FROM BUDGET TO GET FUNDS FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that the city desperately needs more money for police protection, the 
City Council's new majority voted last week to eliminate three top-level staff 
positions and cut funding to the Pomona Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 1 Wednesday to eliminate the positions of Deputy City 
Administrators Sanford Sorenson and Dayle Keller and Executive Assistant Hector 
Godinez from the 1989-90 budget. In the same vote, the council moved to 
redirect revenue from a 30% surcharge on business licenses from Pomona Economic 
Development Corp. to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Council members C.L. (Clay) Bryant, Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua said the cuts 
were needed to help provide an additional $3.1 million for public safety 
services, including $1.7 million for police. Eliminating the three posts will 
save $226,290, and redirecting the business surcharge is expected to net the 
city an additional $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
The action could result in the termination of longtime employees, such as 
Sorenson, who has been with the city 28 years. Soto said the council will let 
interim City Administrator Andrew Lazzaretto decide whether other positions can 
be found for the three staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the city administrator's prerogative," she said. "We need to save 
money, and we need money for the Police Department. We have to find a way to 
get more policemen on the street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Actions 
</P>
<P>
The budget cuts were the latest in a series of actions by the new council 
majority that was created when Ursua took office April 18. And as in the case 
of last month's firing of City Administrator A.J. Wilson and hiring of 
Lazzaretto, the actions of the majority were opposed by Mayor Donna Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it incredible that they can just wipe out three people, and I hope Mr. 
Lazzaretto is not going to be an ax man," Smith said. "The new self-proclaimed 
majority is finally starting to unveil their plan for the new direction for the 
city that we keep hearing about and I think it stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Nymeyer, who was absent during the votes on Wilson and 
Lazzaretto, was unable to attend Wednesday's meeting. But in an interview last 
week, he said he opposed the actions taken by the new majority and what he 
perceived as a penchant for suddenness and secrecy among the three. 
</P>
<P>
"This style of decision-making will only embitter the community toward their 
leadership," Nymeyer said. "It also creates a great deal of tension and 
emotional upheaval among the city employees." 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the council's decision Wednesday night "was not some capricious or 
whimsical act." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that must be done," she said. "For too long, we've been 
sitting up there on the council wringing our hands about not having enough 
police." 
</P>
<P>
Soto added that the criticism of the new majority's actions is political sour 
grapes. "The problem is not Lazzaretto, the problem is not Wilson, the problem 
is the loss of power by the people who have run Pomona for the past 100 years," 
she said. "The shoe is on the other foot now and it pinches."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW SPENDING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 227 to 197, the House approved and sent to the Senate a bill (HR 
2072) to increase spending this fiscal year by $3.7 billion. The so-called dire 
emergency supplemental bill funds several programs that are running out of 
money and others that are politically popular. Democrats generally defended the 
spending as necessary to keep vital programs in operation, while most 
Republicans complained that the bill violates deficit-reduction agreements. 
President Bush has threatened a veto.

Major outlays are $1.2 billion for veterans, $892 million for student loans, 
$822 million for anti-drug initiatives, $423 million for foster care and $342 
million for fighting last year's forest fires. The bill also provides more 
money for the homeless and unemployed, legislative branch operations and 
agencies such as the Agriculture Department and Internal Revenue Service.

GOP Substitute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 205 to 217, the House rejected a Republican attempt to strip the 
$3.7-billion appropriations bill (above) of all spending except $1.2 billion 
for veterans programs including medical care. The motion expressed GOP and 
White House complaints that the Democratic majority was using popular veterans 
spending to run interference for unwarranted increases this fiscal year in 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.) said: "The veterans package is still being 
used as the engine to drive this monstrosity through the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Neal Smith (D-Iowa), said members voting yes "are voting against 
enhancing and speeding up the war on drugs." 
</P>

Members voting yes wanted the bill to fund only veterans programs.

By a vote of 205 to 213, the House defeated a bill (HR 2442) to increase 
anti-drug spending at the expense of the Strategic Defense Initiative missile 
system. Next fiscal year's SDI appropriation was to have been frozen at this 
year's level, freeing up $862 million for immediate transfer to anti-drug 
programs. The bill was to have been joined with the Senate-bound supplemental 
appropriations bill for fiscal 1989 (see preceding votes). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) said the amendment shifts money "from an 
inflated program we do not need, Star Wars, to an under-funded initiative we 
cannot ignore, drug wars." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado) said: "Let's not start tearing the 
country apart and saying that only the liberal left on defense can participate 
actively in the drug war."

Members voting yes wanted to transfer $862 million from SDI to anti-drug

A noisy brawl in a Contra Costa County jail exercise yard at Clayton injured 
eight inmates, one seriously, and resulted in the transfer of some men to the 
tougher facility at Martinez, officials reported. Chief Deputy Larry Ard said a 
free-for-all broke out late Friday night and at its height as many as 100 men 
were involved in the outdoor exercise yard. He blamed the outburst on racial 
tensions, but another source was reported to have blamed it on friction over 
newly transferred women inmates. Ard said most of the injuries were facial cuts 
and bruises. One inmate, not identified, was taken to John Muir Hospital with a 
neck injury.

Rape victims' right of privacy would be extended to all crime victims in New 
York under a bill supported by state Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. Also backing the 
measure was Marla Hanson, a model whose face was slashed with razor blades in 
an attack three years ago. Hanson said she had been humiliated by sexual 
innuendo by a defense attorney for the suspects in the case even though there 
was no sexual aspect to the attack. The state's Rape Shield Law bars defense 
attorneys from harassing rape victims with inquiries into their sexual 
histories. The bill would grant this protection to all crime victims, forcing 
defense lawyers to consult with the judge before introducing evidence of a 
victim's sex life.

 -- The late Fiorello H. La Guardia, who cut a colorful swath as mayor of New 
York for a decade ending in 1945, was quick to quip: "When I make a mistake, 
it's a beaut." Invoking La Guardia on Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis admitted: "Well, I made some beauts in the campaign." Addressing about 
4,000 Massachusetts Democrats at their state convention in Boston, Dukakis 
offered his most extensive discussion of last fall's presidential campaign, 
when he was criticized for not responding to President Bush's attacks over the 
Pledge of Allegiance, Boston Harbor pollution and prison furloughs. "I let him 
get away with that, and I shouldn't have," Dukakis said. He returned to his 
desk the day after the Nov. 8 loss and has avoided talking about the defeat. 
"These have been difficult months," he said, "some of the most difficult I've 
ever encountered."

 -- Stefan Szwarnowski, 76, representing the new wave of ancient mariner, is 
heading back to England the way he came -- alone, aboard his 24-foot sailboat, 
the Tawny Pipit. The Polish-born sailor left Avalon, N.J., near where he landed 
last August after sailing into the Guinness Book of World Records with a 
12-week voyage that made him the oldest person ever to cross the Atlantic alone 
in a sailboat. Food and water ran low on that crossing, and Szwarnowski lost 
weight. Jack Hamann, a marina owner, offered to buy Szwarnowski a plane ticket 
but was turned down. Isn't the trip dangerous? "If something happens you're 
going (to die)," Szwarnowski said, "and if not, you're still going to."

 -- "Just Married" read the big sign on the back of the Portland, Me., city bus 
that also was festooned with paper bells and tin cans tied to the bumper. A 
parade of honking cars followed the bus to a luncheon reception for Claude 
Methot and his new bride, Jan Cole, who had just been married aboard. "There 
are some very nice people on the bus, but I never thought I'd get married on a 
bus," said the bride, 41. She and her husband met on the bus while riding to 
work and became friends. When they decided to marry, the bus seemed a natural. 
They plan to spend their honeymoon in Bermuda where, Methot said, "they've got 
a good bus system." TOM DURKIN

Fines totaling more than $500,000 were levied against employers hiring illegal 
aliens in the the Immigration and Naturalization Service's western region 
during May, including a record $183,200 penalty against a Northern California 
medical center, officials said. The penalty against Seton Health Service 
Foundation Corp. of Daly City, which is affiliated with the 357-bed Seton 
Medical Center, is the largest ever against an employer in the western region, 
INS officials said. In addition to California, the region includes Arizona, 
Hawaii, Nevada and Guam. Larry Arnold, an attorney representing Seton Health, 
said the fine was "being investigated" but refused to comment on whether it 
would be appealed.

Two San Joaquin Valley counties were accused in Fresno of violating the federal 
Clean Air Act by failing to meet air quality standards. Three environmentalist 
groups -- Citizens for a Healthy Environment, Sierra Club and Kern County 
Valley Action Network -- filed suit in U.S. District Court, calling for the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency to impose sanctions on Kern and Fresno 
counties for failing to meet a 1987 compliance deadline. The suit alleges that 
the two counties have "consistently violated the federal health standards for 
ozone."

Federal and county agents seized 8,049 marijuana plants with a potential value 
of $25 million in a Placer County barn and made two arrests in what they 
described as the largest indoor pot-growing raid in California history. Bob 
Burns of the Placer County Narcotics Task Force said the barn had all the 
latest technology for indoor growing, including fluorescent grow lights and 
fans to replace carbon dioxide with fresh air. Arrested were Timothy Edward 
Wolford, 26, and Cheryl Marie Chrisman, 25. They were charged with suspicion of 
cultivating marijuana and possession of marijuana for sale. Chrisman's father, 
Richard, 47, was being sought for questioning.

Leftist guerrillas bombed a bus carrying Peruvian government palace guards 
through downtown Lima, killing at least six soldiers and a police officer and 
wounding 24 other people. A car blocked the bus while it was en route to the 
palace, and two people maneuvered a pushcart loaded with explosives under the 
back of the vehicle and then detonated them, police said. The guards opened 
fire, but the suspects escaped. The government of President Alan Garcia, who 
lives at the palace, is fighting two leftist guerrilla organizations, the 
Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement.

The Soviet Union's new 542-member Supreme Soviet convened for the first time 
and chose economist Yevgeny M. Primakov as chairman of the Soviet of the Union, 
one of the two chambers of the legislature, the standing lawmaking body, which 
will meet for eight months each year. The second chamber is the Soviet of 
Nationalities. Primakov, an ally of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, proposed 
creating four commissions and 14 committees, including one to oversee the KGB 
secret police. Primakov said the committees are modeled in part on the U.S. 
Congress.

FRANK STELLA: MINIMALIST TO THE MAX;

HE HAS ENJOYED FAIL-SAFE CAREER

Frank Stella certainly doesn't look like the leading international Classical 
Baroque master of abstract art. At 53 he is fit if a trifle paunchy. Installing 
his show in the galleries of the County Museum of Art, he blends in with the 
crew wearing gray chinos, gray T-shirt and black Reeboks. They match his short, 
grizzled hair, but neither his tan complexion nor his huge colorful works. 
Woody Allen could play the part of the painter if you toned the actor down a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
Stella consults with museum director Earl (Rusty) Powell, who looks 
resplendently dignified in a dark suit. They appear involved in a matter of 
great import. Maybe something about changes Stella is making in the hanging. 
The 40 or so works look airy but range up to a ton in weight and some are 
cantilevered from false walls so switching them around is no easy matter. As it 
turns out, the two men are just making a date to play squash later in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
There is something of the athletic realist about the painter. He used to go to 
a lot of Formula One races in Europe, and he still breeds racehorses as a hobby 
although he doesn't much like to talk about it. "My biggest nightmare is that 
someday I'll breed a winner. Imagine having a horse that's more famous than you 
are." He has the slightly incredulous twang and staccato delivery of a real New 
Yorker. He used to have a reputation as a somewhat thorny character. These days 
he is relaxed and affable even in the midst of an installation. 
</P>
<P>
As painters go, there are very few who equal the stature and reknown of Frank 
Stella. For nearly 30 years he has held center stage in the art world. He 
started successful in the '60s and instead of fizzling out with the demise of 
Minimalist abstraction, he got a huge second wind in his series of glitzy 
Baroque template paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time I resisted being an artist. In the social milieu where I grew 
up, there was something demeaning about it. My parents' view was that artists 
were possibly a little better than pimps. They thought art had to do with the 
past. Michelangelo could be a great artist, but there was no sense in being an 
artist in the present." 
</P>
<P>
Stella was born in a suburb of Boston. His father was a gynecologist, his 
mother had gone to art school. He attended Andover and Princeton. When he came 
on the art scene, such tony university credentials were virtually unheard of. 
He represented a new breed of intellectually sophisticated artist. He married 
the art critic Barbara Rose. Another critic, Michael Fried, served as best man. 
His early work was intensely rational and seemingly designed to fuel critical 
dialogue. The work was tight. Today everybody wants to know how he made the 
transition to his loose manner. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers think it came from a happy second marriage to Helen McGurk and 
the birth of two sons whom the artist enjoys enormously. But he doesn't much 
like such psychological interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
"I taught myself to paint doing the stripe paintings. I saw them as somehow 
parallel to other painting but not really painting. Somehow I needed to isolate 
myself. I wanted to be separate from it. Maybe something in my temperament. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing the stripe paintings gave me the freedom and courage I needed before I 
could loosen up and join the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Stella has the reputation as one of the most influential figures of his day. 
One sees his shadow constantly in the works of other artists both obscure and 
famous. Just outside the galleries housing his retrospective there is a colored 
sculpture by Nancy Graves, which bears a family resemblance to his art. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm aware of influence, but it cuts both ways. How could you look at 
what I'm doing now and not think of what John Chamberlain has been doing for 
years? I just got to it later. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the '60s were a good period. There was an extraordinary level of 
energy both in the degree of talent and in the numbers of artists. Think about 
all those good people from Ellsworth Kelly to Jack Youngerman and Pop people 
like James Rosenquist. I'll give you nine to five there will be an Olitski 
revival in a few years. Anthony Caro is an extraordinary talent." 
</P>
<P>
But if they are still so good, why is he the one universally seen as the 
unfaltering winner, the artist with the fail-safe career? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I just have a talent for shooting my mouth off. You know the public is 
lazy. If they see the same thing long enough, they accept it and fall asleep. 
Change wakes them up. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't change, he says, for the public. In his view the changes that 
evolved in the studio were gradual and logical rather than dramatic. It is 
striking that late stripe paintings and the Baroque works in the galleries are 
so clearly the creation of the same man. 
</P>
<P>
"Painters paint to keep themselves interested," Stella shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
The retrospective has been traveling since 1987, LACMA being its final stop. 
Stella traveled to all six venues, including stops in Paris and Amsterdam. He 
notices the work seems to change in each location. 
</P>
<P>
"Some pieces get tired on the road, others seem to like to travel. You know 
this is sort of trivial, but there are pieces here that seem to be finished and 
others that stay alive. They all come back to the studio between shows and we 
work on some of them. Those two (Wave Series) pieces over there were almost 
completely repainted after the Berlin show." 
</P>
<P>
He paces the galleries constantly as he talks to a visitor. Critics have raised 
questions about the genre of the works. Are they paintings or relief 
sculptures? Stella says he has been grappling with that, "learning" from the 
works. He points out how he has progressively resolved the problems that arise 
from having works jut so far out from the walls that they have several angles 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's getting pretty well solved. When you study your own work, it's 
the ideas in them that turn out to be useful. You try to combine the best of 
what you've done before and come up with something that really has it all." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm haunted by this fear that in the end what you make is only an object, only 
a decorative thing. I try to infuse the work with real life, but you never 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Stella is noted as an obdurate defender of abstract art and of modernism, which 
seem to be pretty much the same thing to him -- the legitimate extension of the 
history of all art. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk a bunch of baloney here, but painting is not a base 
activity. Painting is a high calling and what you do should contribute to the 
life of the overall thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe an artist like Lucien Freud is saying something interesting at some 
level, but I don't think it's anything I should have to worry about. Balthus is 
an even better example. He's almost prurient. I guess I find that kind of art 
too eccentric, too individual. 
</P>
<P>
"The artist has a funny relation to history. He is history but he has to be it 
and do it at the same time. That requires some distance and some integrity."

RELIVING NIXON'S 'FINAL DAYS'; 
</P>
<P>
ABC-TV DOCUDRAMA, BASED ON WOODWARD/BERNSTEIN BOOK, DETAILS THE RESIGNATION OF 
A PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He swallowed his words saying, "We have done some things wrong in this 
Administration and the top man always takes the responsibility. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He fought back tears talking about his father, who owned the "poorest lemon 
ranch in California," then sold it before they struck oil and became a grocer. 
"But he was a great man because he did his job. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And when he mentioned his mother, whom he said no one would ever write a book 
about, his voice fell to a whisper. "Well, I guess all of you would say this 
about your mother" -- he paused -- "my mother was a saint." 
</P>
<P>
Remember? 
</P>
<P>
It was from Richard Nixon's last speech as President on Friday Aug., 9, 1974, 
coming back to TV in the form of docudrama. And these were the final days in 
the shooting of "The Final Days" -- a three-hour movie for ABC based on the 
1976 book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- with actor Lane Smith as Nixon. 
As the fourth in a series of AT&amp;T Presents dramas, "Final Days" airs next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gold Room at Pasadena Civic Auditorium late last winter -- the 
high-ceilinged ballroom bore the closest resemblance the producers could find 
to the East Room of the White House -- there was a palpable hush among the cast 
and 200 extras as Smith portrayed Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the Nixon character a pace and off to his left stood actress Susan 
Brown, looking oh-so-much like the real Pat Nixon with her prim hairdo and 
pink-and-white gingham dress just like the one the First Lady wore that final 
day. As Mrs. Nixon, the actress also wore a stoic face reddened by the effort 
to stay in control. The characters of the two Nixon daughters and sons-in-law 
completed the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Now 15 years later -- and much to the disapproval of Nixon family loyalists -- 
here they all are again -- Dick and Pat, Watergate and the lawyers, the courts 
and the tapes. Facing certain impeachment on charges of obstruction of justice 
and abuse of power, the 37th President had virtually no choice but to resign. 
The irony was that it was not the actual break-in at Democratic National 
Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in 1972 that forced the first 
presidential resignation in American history, but the cover-up afterward. 
</P>
<P>
As the last chapter of the Watergate scandal, written by the two Washington 
Post reporters who broke the Watergate story, "Final Days" was the stuff of 
high drama. Like the book, the script deals with the behind-the-scenes saga of 
the last 15 months in the Nixon White House. The mood of fatalism is summed up 
early on in the docudrama when Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment, played by "St. 
Elsewhere's" Ed Flanders, says: "We've got time bombs all over. Some have 
already exploded, the rest lie ticking. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do the obvious," said executive producer Stu Samuels, who had 
been ABC's vice president for movies and miniseries when "The Day After," the 
landmark drama about nuclear war, and "Something About Amelia," the first TV 
movie to deal with incest, were made. "I didn't want to bash Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
Without prompting, Samuels shrugged. "Because it's too easy. The issue for me 
was: How do you provide insight into the mistake? Clearly Nixon had made a 
mistake. How did that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the man's accomplishments: Nixon remains one of the most outstanding 
Presidents in contemporary history with regard to his achievements. He did get 
us out of Vietnam. He did reopen a dialogue with China. This is not a stupid 
man, a man given to casual error. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There's a wonderful moment in the movie," Samuels said, "when Nixon is in his 
E.O.B. (Executive Office Building) office, when he says to (Press Secretary 
Ron) Ziegler, 'Maybe we were talking about a cover-up.' It's as though he were 
waking from a dream, at least from an unconscious state, and asking himself, 
'Is this what we were doing?' Our own assessment is that this President acted 
as though he were on a kind of auto pilot." 
</P>
<P>
The script was written by Hugh Whitemore, an Englishman who wrote "Concealed 
Enemies," PBS' Emmy-winning "American Playhouse" miniseries about the Alger 
Hiss case (in which then-Rep. Nixon had a featured role), as well as the plays 
"Pack of Lies" and "Breaking the Code." Both Samuels and ABC felt that a 
non-American would be more dispassionate. 
</P>
<P>
Whitemore anchored his script around Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt. "It's pure 
instinct, but dramatically it seems to me things work better with much 
less-known people," the writer said. 
</P>
<P>
So, while the relatively unfamiliar Smith and Brown respectively play Nixon and 
Mrs. Nixon, Richard Kiley ("A Year in the Life," "Man of La Mancha") is 
Buzhardt. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what attracted him to the role of Buzhardt, one the least known of the 
Watergate players, Kiley snapped to attention: "You just answered your own 
question. He was one of the mystery men, very much behind the scenes, and yet 
he played a key role. He was the one who really found the incriminating (tape) 
passages. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward, now an assistant managing editor at the Washington Post and author of 
another controversial book-turned-movie, "Wired," about the final days of 
comedian John Belushi, was an active consultant on the production. He supplied 
notes on Buzhardt. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the final speech that Nixon shed some emotional masks, as well as a 
certain vanity. Reading a passage from Theodore Roosevelt's diary, he put his 
glasses on for the first time in public. So does Smith in his long monologue. 
</P>
<P>
How do you play Nixon? And how do you bypass what director Richard Pearce calls 
the bump -- that instant when the audience knows it's an actor, after all? 
</P>
<P>
Pearce ("Country," "Heartland"), who was in Yale's Class of 1965 with Woodward 
though they didn't know each other then, said he "did not want the portrait of 
Nixon to be charged with a star turn, somebody who is doing Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
So, with ABC's consent, he chose Smith, 50, originally from Memphis, a 
professional actor for 29 years, who won a Drama Desk award for his role in 
"Glengarry Glen Ross" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The actor was cast so hurriedly as Nixon -- less than a week before shooting 
began -- that he had no time to read the book. His hairline was shaved to 
resemble Nixon's, and each morning his hair had to be finger-waved. But a 
prosthetic ski-jump nose was not used. Neither Pearce nor Smith wanted 
"imitation" or "caricature." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing to read for ABC, Smith found an old Nixon tape. "I got the 
physicality of Nixon," Smith said. "He's so specific in what he does, but you 
have to get it to the point where it's second nature to you, and then not 
overdo it." 
</P>
<P>
"I stay pretty much in character the whole time I'm here, I stay in the 
physicality. I'll show you," Smith said, standing and hitching up his trousers. 
"My father used to wear his pants real high like they did in those days. And 
all of a sudden I saw pictures of Nixon with his pants way up to here. So you 
put your pants up there, and it's a little tilt back, and then all of a sudden 
it's just there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Smith captured the Nixon wave as he stood on the helicopter ramp, when he 
realized Nixon "throws his hand away almost. His wrist, it's limp but it's not 
effeminate. And I think part of that physicality is that there's so much 
emotion there." 
</P>
<P>
The actor deliberately did not view tapes of Nixon's final speech, but he said 
he could play it because he understands loss. "Here you have this man totally 
isolated from everybody, from his loved ones. He can't reach out to a soul. 
With all the power and majesty of his office, you have him isolated down to 
three or four people. So you see the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't the pain brought on by Nixon himself, Smith was asked? 
</P>
<P>
"Pain is pain. I can't approach this, right or wrong, who's going to throw the 
first stone here? Regardless of whether he brought this upon himself, it's 
tragedy, Greek tragedy, it's Richard III, the fatal flaw. And I had to evoke in 
my experience that pain. . . . I called on the very most private things that 
have occurred to me, as far as the loss of a great love, and the isolation, 
when things totally turned against me in my life." 
</P>
<P>
He was quiet for a moment, making it clear he would not brook further 
questions, then added: "If there is a parallel between Nixon and Lane Smith, 
it's that I've been waiting for this moment for many, many years and for this 
kind of work. So when it came about, even with this short a period of time, 
it's like everything that I know, my whole experience of 36 years, 29 
professional, it all came together." 
</P>
<P>
For Pearce, 15 years after Nixon's resignation, his movie must balance "the 
emotional issues surrounding this man's loss of the presidency and the abuses 
of power that went on during the Nixon presidency. It's not the sorrow and the 
pity, it's like the horror and the pity. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after principal photography was done in March, the director was 
discussing technique as well as politics. 
</P>
<P>
"We begin the movie -- it's not in the script -- when Nixon is backstage on 
nomination night '68, and it echoes everything up to the (Robert F.) Kennedy 
assassination. All the Secret Service are there, and the kitchen help and the 
campaigners, and you (Nixon) are like a rock star. 
</P>
<P>
"For me there's a great shot from an early film when people were first working 
with hand-held cameras. It's a documentary called 'Primary' about (John F.) 
Kennedy in the Wisconsin primary. This was (early) cinema verite where people 
were following a character around. The camera was right behind the back of his 
head, and you saw what it was like to be Kennedy that night." 
</P>
<P>
Pearce would have liked to take the Nixon character onto the stage "to see the 
whole place rise up" but he said budgetary constraints precluded re-creating 
the GOP Convention in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"But we could take him right up to the moment that he walks out on stage," 
Pearce continued, "and then with stock footage, you see Nixon from a distance, 
the footage so far away you can accept it. Then we go to the speech that begins 
the script, and the preparations for it. You don't see Lane Smith's face. You 
see it the way you saw Kennedy -- you never saw Jack Kennedy's face; you saw 
everybody else relating to him. You never hear Nixon's actual voice. You hear 
Lane's voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Then what happens, you gradually introduce the image of him as Nixon on a TV 
monitor. It was easier to introduce him where you sort of felt he was 
President. He's talking about accepting the resignations of (H.R.) Haldeman and 
(John) Ehrlichman, he's speaking about Watergate. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of that speech, said Pearce, "we will have seen enough of Lane as 
President to allow him to speak directly to the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon camp apparently first learned about a TV production of "The Final 
Days" after Pearce phoned Steve Bull, now a tobacco company lobbyist who had 
been Nixon's personal aide. "You can imagine, I'm going to have to re-create 
not just the words but what it felt like to be in the room. Did Nixon pace? Did 
he just sit at his desk? Did somebody smoke? Hundreds of questions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So Pearce invited Bull to the set. "Suddenly he was talking as if this was an 
ideological issue. The book was the enemy, Woodward and Bernstein were the 
enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Samuels says with pride that the script scrupulously adheres to the book, "the 
primary source." "We are dealing with a living ex-President, and in all of us 
there was a sense of responsibility for getting it right. You don't want to 
take cheap shots. It wasn't a question of libel. On the other hand, here is a 
book written by two of America's most noted journalists, in existence for years 
now, and with no legal action against it." 
</P>
<P>
Old arguments involving the accuracy of specific incidents in "The Final Days" 
(see story on Page 80) also did not bother Alfred R. Schneider, ABC vice 
president for policy and standards. "We relied on the veracity of the book," he 
said, adding: "It's certainly of notice that (a lawsuit) did not occur." 
</P>
<P>
Still the script does contain certain inaccuracies, such as having Nixon in the 
White House as the Supreme Court unanimously ruled he had to turn over crucial 
tapes, when actually he was in San Clemente. "I kept driving (Whitemore) back 
to what's in the book," noted Woodward, "and for reasons of compression he may 
have had to do it a different way. In 'All the President's Men,' they had to 
compress the city editor and metropolitan editor into one character. . . . As a 
reporter, I would do it the way it happened." 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly added that he and Bernstein had the "luxury of a 450-page book." 
More important, Woodward noted, Whitemore caught "the emotional reality" inside 
the White House, the "isolation" of Nixon. "As I watched some of it being made, 
there's not a wasted word or phrase. It's very tight, very directed at the 
target -- 'What was it like?' Jack Kennedy's question to journalists always 
(had been) 'Tell me what it was like.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Samuels' request, Woodward phoned Schneider to clear up two problems the ABC 
executive had with the script. One was the Kissinger-Nixon prayer scene," 
Woodward said, "and essentially there are differences in the (Kissinger and 
'Final Days') versions, and I said, 'Now sit down and read 'em both. What's 
really different here, and what's disputed? . . . There's really minor 
difference.' " 
</P>
<P>
In "Final Days," Woodward and Bernstein wrote that Kissinger knelt along with 
Nixon that Wednesday night before Nixon resigned. Nixon seemed to back them up, 
Woodward points out. In his memoirs Nixon said he asked Kissinger "to pray with 
me now and we knelt." Kissinger wrote: "In whatever posture, I was filled with 
a deep sense of awe." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward also stands by their book's account of Nixon pounding the carpet. Even 
Kissinger described Nixon as "shattered," Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
On a second point, Woodward said he and Schneider discussed a scene in the 
script, which is in the book, where Nixon is portrayed gnawing at an aspirin 
bottle because he can't open it with his hands. "They had to make sure it was 
an illustration of clumsiness, and not that he was going to (kill himself)," 
Woodward said, "and that it was aspirin. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward said he told Schneider he could justify everything he and Bernstein 
wrote -- in court, "if it ever came to that, but we wouldn't reveal our 
sources." 
</P>
<P>
But it's "not the issue now," Woodward explained. "The essential historical 
point is that with time, truth emerges." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing that Hugh Whitemore used," Woodward said. "When Julie 
(Nixon Eisenhower) said in her book the family was talking about the tape 
transcripts and Nixon says, 'Was it worth it?' ...Wow, I wished we'd had that 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
From Woodcliff Lake, N.J. where Nixon has his office, not far from his home in 
Saddle River, aide John Taylor said the ex-President has "lived through hammer 
blow after hammer blow of pressure and controversy. Frankly an ABC 
Entertainment dramatization of 'The Final Days,' at this late point, is really 
not going to keep Richard Nixon up nights."

NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK ARE THE OSMONDS WITH SOUL, SINGS THEIR CREATOR

"There's never been anything like it in the history of the record business," 
boasted Maurice Starr, the Svengali behind the red-hot teen singing group, New 
Kids on the Block. "Nothing like it ever anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The jabberings of a hustler? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there's a bit of Muhammad Ali in Starr, a 34-year-old Florida native. But 
he does know his teen groups. Starr discovered New Edition and masterminded 
their early success. 
</P>
<P>
In New Kids, he has something to brag about again. New Kids, who perform 
tonight at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim and return to the Universal 
Amphitheatre with Tiffany on June 25, are unique in some ways. This Boston 
outfit is certainly the biggest white teen group since the Osmonds were big 
stars in the late '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes New Kids really different from any other successful white teen 
vocal group is their style. It's black -- very black. 
</P>
<P>
"These are white kids who are black," Starr insisted. "They have white skins 
but they're black. They have soul. They sing black. That's how I taught them to 
sing." 
</P>
<P>
New Kids' second album, "Hangin' Tough" on Columbia Records, has sold more than 
2 million copies. It includes three Top 10 singles, "Please Don't Go Girl," 
"The Right Stuff" and the current "I'll Be Loving You (Forever)." This is the 
first teen vocal group to have three Top 10 singles from one album. 
</P>
<P>
Something else, Starr noted, distinguishes New Kids. 
</P>
<P>
"They have me as a manager," he said, letting out a triumphant howl. 
</P>
<P>
"A hit teen white group managed by a black man, a black man who also writes, 
produces and arranges their albums -- who also created the group. That just 
doesn't happen in this business." 
</P>
<P>
Starr, though, didn't want to acknowledge exceptions -- like black manager 
Russell Simmons' guiding the white rappers, the Beastie Boys. "If it's been 
done before, the black manager didn't last," Starr said. "He was probably 
replaced by a white manager." 
</P>
<P>
The Beasties' new managers are white -- Andy Slater and Howard Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
The success of New Kids, he insisted, vindicates black managers, who generally 
get a bad rap. "Black managers are always (being characterized) as crooked and 
incompetent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When black stars get big, they hire white managers. Look at Michael Jackson, 
Lionel Richie and all the rest. Some of these black artists may have black 
managers when they start out but when they get to a certain level, they hire 
white managers. That's the way it's always been." 
</P>
<P>
"When I first met Maurice I was very impressed," said Donny Wahlberg, 19, of 
New Kids, in a separate interview. "He was a down-to-earth guy. Not somebody in 
a three-piece suit, but a regular guy." 
</P>
<P>
They met in 1984, when Starr and another manager, Mary Alford -- who's no 
longer associated with the group -- were looking to form a young white singing 
group. The first recruit was Wahlberg, who, in turn, brought in his pals. 
</P>
<P>
The other New Kids are Danny Wood, 18, Joe McIntyre, 16, and the Knight 
brothers, Jordan, 18, and Jon, 19. McIntyre replaced an original member who 
dropped out before the first album was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Wahlberg knew about Starr because of New Edition, the black bubble-gum group 
Starr discovered in 1983 and developed into a hit-making outfit -- much like 
he's done with New Kids. After one album, though, Starr's relationship with New 
Edition turned sour, ending in a barrage of lawsuits. New Edition, of course, 
is still prospering, and former member Bobby Brown is becoming a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
"What I had in mind for New Edition was making them the new Jackson 5," Starr 
recalled. "With New Kids I wanted to re-create the Osmonds. . . . The Osmonds 
had talent but they didn't have soul and they didn't have enough good material. 
The New Kids are different from the Osmonds. They have talent and soul and good 
material -- good black material." 
</P>
<P>
When Starr began working with New Kids, they were unpolished performers. "I 
wasn't even a performer when I met Maurice," Wahlberg said. "I was about 15. 
I'd been rapping and dancing. Three of the guys had done some singing. But none 
of us were experienced. He found me because he had spread the word in the 
neighborhood that he was looking for white kids to form a group. I was 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
Said Starr, "I was looking for kids with looks, charisma and determination, 
kids with average talent, kids with soul. I needed kids who knew the black 
culture and white kids who were hip enough to hang with blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Wahlberg, who grew up with the other group members, explained why they're so 
knowledgeable about black culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We grew up with black kids," he said. "In first grade I was being bused to a 
school in an all-black area. We were all bused to black schools, all except 
Joe, the youngest guy in the group. He didn't go to a black school but he still 
knows the black culture. Contrary to what the white racists think about busing, 
it was the greatest thing to happen to us." 
</P>
<P>
Musically, all the New Kids members were influenced by black artists. "Danny 
was a rapper just like I was," Wahlberg said. "We all listened to a lot of 
R&amp;B. That's what our friends were into. Singing black came natural to us. 
Some of the guys were really into the Stylistics." 
</P>
<P>
That partly explains why New Kids' ballads are done Stylistics-style -- smooth, 
soulful and ultra-romantic. Starr is very familiar with that style too. He did 
some composing and producing on two Stylistics' albums. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the group members sing leads, with Wahlberg and Jordan Knight 
handling the bulk of them. Two of the three hit singles have been ballads, 
spotlighting their falsetto skills. The New Kids show is now much more 
sophisticated. Track dates -- singing to taped instrumentals -- are a thing of 
the past. Since April, the group has had its own back-up band. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few years, New Kids played black clubs and theaters, mostly in 
the Boston area. "We were known in black parts of town but not in the white 
parts," Wahlberg said. "We played some tough places." That was part of Starr's 
master plan. "I didn't want them to perform for white audiences," he explained. 
"White audiences wouldn't have been tough enough on them. They would have been 
impressed by the novelty of a white group singing black. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wanted them to work for black audiences. They're the tough audiences for 
a group like this. Right away, they'd see them a black rip-off. They'll boo you 
off the stage. I knew when they were good enough to be accepted by black 
audiences, they were ready." 
</P>
<P>
Black audiences for the most part have liked New Kids, Starr insisted. But not 
all the time. "In their first show, they were booed off the stage," he 
recalled. "At this one black festival some black people were throwing stones. 
The security people had to stop the show to get them off stage." 
</P>
<P>
None of this came as a surprise to New Kids. "We knew what we were doing wasn't 
easy and that some black people wouldn't accept us," Wahlberg said. "Maurice 
had warned us." 
</P>
<P>
Weren't the parents of the group members concerned about their youngsters' 
hanging around black ghetto clubs and facing hostile situations? 
</P>
<P>
"They probably were concerned but I never heard about it," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Starr emphasized that New Kids aren't just clients. "These are like my own 
kids," he said. "I practically raised these guys. I couldn't feel closer to my 
own kids." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling, Wahlberg said, is mutual. "We're very close to him. He's been a 
very good teacher. I know when I started out I had never sung before. I was 
scared. I had no confidence in my singing. But he gave me confidence. He built 
us all up. He made us feel like we could do anything." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't one of those overnight success stories. 
</P>
<P>
Starr sold Columbia Records on New Kids, but the first album, "New Kids on the 
Block," released in 1986, flopped. "We sounded like New Edition," Wahlberg 
said. "It was a bubble-gum sound. It wasn't bad, though." 
</P>
<P>
What doomed the album was its marketing plan. It was promoted to black radio, 
which rejected it. "It was a hard sell," Starr recalled. "It had nothing to do 
with the music. Black radio was hesitant to play it because New Kids were 
white. That happens sometimes on black radio." 
</P>
<P>
The second album, "Hangin' Tough" -- released last year -- started out the same 
way. Starr had tried to smooth the way for the album by taking tapes around to 
black radio months before the album's release, but met with great resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Please Don't Go (Girl)" -- the album's first single -- was ignored at first by 
black radio. The second album, as well as the New Kids' career, seemed 
finished. But pop radio came riding to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a video of the song, the single finally got some pop airplay and 
slowly became a Top 10 hit -- pulling the album along with it. Three hit 
singles later, "Hangin' Tough" -- which didn't make the pop charts until months 
after its release -- has sold more than two million copies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Starr's efforts, black radio has been slow to warm to New Kids. Each 
single has done progressively better, but none has been a black-chart 
blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
The New Kids members, though, long for that black acceptance. "It's great to be 
a hit with the pop audience, but we want to make it with the black audience," 
Wahlberg insisted. "These are black records we're making. Black people more 
than any others should appreciate that. We feel a strong tie to the black 
audience. Once we're a hit on black radio and with the black audience, then 
we've really made it."

THE TONYS: AN HONOR IN DECLINE; 
</P>
<P>
THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE A FAIR PICTURE OF THE NEW YORK THEATER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's Tony time again. Tonight at 9, millions of Americans will gather around 
their TV sets to watch the 43rd annual Antoinette Perry Awards, broadcast from 
Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and emceed by Angela Lansbury. 
</P>
<P>
Let's roll that one again. Tonight at 9, after "Murder, She Wrote," millions of 
Americans will say: "Want to watch the Tonys for a little while?" After two or 
three awards, millions of Americans will remember that they've got to get up 
early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
This has been the viewing pattern for the Tony Awards even when the Broadway 
theater has had a good season. This year, the cupboard was virtually bare, and 
the show's TV producer, Don Mischer, will have to go heavy on production values 
to disguise it. 
</P>
<P>
Take musicals -- the theater form that Broadway invented. The Tony Award for 
Best Musical used to go to a new show, like "Fiddler on the Roof" or "West Side 
Story." The leading contender for the best musical of 1989 is "Jerome Robbins' 
Broadway." It features numbers from "West Side Story" and "Fiddler on the 
Roof." 
</P>
<P>
Another contender is "Black and Blue." This is a tribute to the Cotton Club and 
the great blues singers of the past. Another backward-looking show. In more 
plentiful seasons, it and the Robbins show would have been called revivals. 
</P>
<P>
The third contender is "Starmites." This isn't something you sprinkle on Fruit 
Loops. It is an officially certified Broadway musical, running at a new cabaret 
theater called the Criterion. Variety says that its plot concerns "a 
fantasy-fixated teen-age girl dreaming she's an exiled intergalactic princess, 
who becomes involved with a quartet of boyish space troopers." Variety adds 
that it is "silly, heavy and dull." 
</P>
<P>
Usually there are four contenders for Best Musical. This year, there were only 
three. Why? Probably because "Legs Diamond" might have received the fourth 
nomination, and everybody would have burst out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
There won't be an award for Best Book or Best Score this year, either. So much 
for the Broadway musical at the end of the '80s. Now let's look at the Best 
Play category. This used to be won by plays like "Death of a Salesman" and 
"Streetcar Named Desire" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf." The play with 
the most nominations this year (seven) is . . . "Lend Me a Tenor." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you haven't heard of "Lend Me a Tenor." It concerns a fellow who has to 
go on stage and pretend to be an opera singer. Heyy, Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
Actually it's more likely that this year's Best Play will be Wendy 
Wasserstein's "The Heidi Chronicles." It is rueful and charming, and it is 
about something: woman's liberation as it has worked out in practice since the 
'60s. It's not a heavyweight play, but it's a nice middleweight one, and it's 
good to have it on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Where did "Heidi" come from? Off-Off-Broadway: Playwrights Horizons. It also 
had a workshop at the Seattle Repertory Theatre. That's typical these days. 
Years ago, plays were written directly for Broadway. Today almost all Broadway 
"product" -- the word is now used without irony or apology -- comes from 
someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to look at this change. Critics tend to say it means that 
Broadway has lost its position as the creative center of the American theater 
-- that it has become a kind of shopping mall for whatever good, bad or 
indifferent stuff a producer has the money to bring in, from "Nicholas 
Nickleby" to "Moose Murders." 
</P>
<P>
Alternately, you could say that nothing has changed, really; that Broadway is 
still our theater's summit, the place where all American plays want to go. In 
this reading, the rest of the theater world is a test track for Broadway: a 
proving ground to see whether a show has got the stamina to make it in the big 
time. If it doesn't get to Broadway, this proves it didn't have the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't give a yearling calf a blue ribbon for being a prize bull, would 
you? No. It would be equally silly to give a Tony Award to some nice little 
show from Playwrights Horizons or the Seattle Rep -- that is, until it attracts 
enough investor interest to be able to afford a production on 45th Street. 
</P>
<P>
This second point of view is the one held by the League of American Theaters 
and Producers, the trade association that is the muscle behind the Tony Awards. 
Formerly the League of New York Theaters and Producers, this group represents 
the owners and major users of the 39 Times Square-area theaters known 
collectively as Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The league doesn't own the Tony Awards. They were invented and are awarded in 
the name of the American Theatre Wing, the volunteer group that sponsored the 
Stage Door Canteen in World War II. (The late Antoinette Perry -- "Tony" -- was 
the Theatre Wing's guiding force in those days.) 
</P>
<P>
But the league does have a powerful say in the administration of the Tony 
Awards, particularly since the Tonys became a network TV show in 1967 -- the 
only national TV broadcast that honors the theater. That "the theater" should 
be equated with the Broadway theater is obviously to the league's interest, and 
that is the subtext behind the show. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it also limits to the heart of the show -- the awards themselves 
-- to the current Broadway season. This can be embarrassing when the season is 
as paltry as it was this year -- only 19 new shows (plus 10 revivals). Not much 
of an ad for "the theater." Certainly not much of an ad for the New York 
theater. American resident theater, which probably produces 200 new scripts a 
year, gets at least a token nod from the Tonys, in the form of a special award 
to a particular resident theater -- this year, the Hartford Stage. (Last year 
it was South Coast Repertory.) 
</P>
<P>
But Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway get no recognition at all. This is 
particularly embarrassing in the case of new plays -- embarrassing, not to 
Off-Broadway, but to the prestige of the Tonys as a symbol of excellence in the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
It's easier for a serious movie to win an Oscar than it is for a serious play 
to win a Tony. Either the investor interest isn't there (today's investors want 
to see a return right away) or the production is doing perfectly well in a 
smaller theater and doesn't particularly want to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
A.R. Gurney's "The Cocktail Hour," for instance, has run all season at an 
uptown house, the Promenade, before a clientele that in the old days would have 
supported it on Broadway -- but at today's prices can't afford to. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened two seasons ago with Horton Foote's "The Widow Claire" 
at the downtown branch of Circle in the Square, a superbly underwritten play by 
an American master. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Broadway plays are eligible for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama, and often win 
it. (Indeed, this is getting to be the rule.) Absurdly, they aren't eligible 
for a Tony. But a trifle like "Lend Me a Tenor" is. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Peter Stone addressed the issue in a recent edition of the Theatre 
Development Fund's magazine, Sightlines. 
</P>
<P>
"The major playwrights of America are not functioning on Broadway," he writes. 
"Broadway is not user-friendly to serious plays any more." 
</P>
<P>
Stone notes that serious plays are being written and performed all over the 
country and all over the city too. But these don't get "the same attention as 
they would on Broadway, because it's to the interest of the real-estate people, 
who are now the major producers on Broadway, to maintain their geographic 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
"That's where their investments lie," Stone continues. "So they're desperately 
hanging onto this Broadway label, as promoted by their Tony Awards. That the 
major plays written in this country are not eligible for the excellence award 
in the theater is becoming ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Ludicrous and dangerous to the reputation of the Tony Awards and that of the 
American Theatre Wing. The wing's original intention was to honor excellence in 
the American theater -- as defined in 1947. The definition has changed, but the 
Tonys haven't, and the chickens may come home to roost on CBS tonight. 
</P>
<P>
As for us, we plan to honor the American theater by taking in a play.

A SIMPLE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS

<P>
Last year's great restaurant experiment gave us Fennel and the "shuttle chefs" 
-- four chefs who jet into Los Angeles -- one at a time -- from France every 
month or so. Last month, Roland Gibert and Maurice Peguet opened Tulipe, a 
restaurant where two head chefs work side-by-side. Do too many chefs spoil the 
fumet? 
</P>
<P>
"He's the meat man; I'm the fish guy," Peguet says, and then -- he can't help 
himself -- he bears his teeth in a grin. 
</P>
<P>
You have to understand that at this moment, barely two months after Tulipe 
grilled its first squab, Gibert and Peguet are two happy chefs. Chat with them 
together for awhile, and you hear the kind of shy snickering you might 
associate with 12-year-olds who've just realized that girls don't necessarily 
have cooties. 
</P>
<P>
What Gibert and Peguet have rediscovered is the joy of cooking. Each comes to 
Tulipe from a huge hotel kitchen (Gibert from Bernard's and Califia; Peguet 
from L'Escoffier), the kind of place where haute cuisine is more management 
skills than art. (Costing out butter swans typically becomes more important 
than a perfect beurre blanc.) 
</P>
<P>
"It was frustrating," Gibert says. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Very impersonal," Peguet chimes in. 
</P>
<P>
And so Gibert and Peguet traded in their hordes of prep cooks and their 
gleaming hotel kitchens for relatively compact quarters -- the open kitchen at 
Tulipe. 
</P>
<P>
"In a restaurant like this," Peguet says, "we have to be out there working the 
stoves with the rest of the gang -- on the line, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little bit of stage fright at first," Gilbert says. "And it took some 
coordinating to get a routine going -- we'd be bumping into each other. But it 
was worth it. We're back in action." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . And more in reality," Peguet adds.

CELEBRATING ITS 100TH YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
A FRONTIER DREAM COMES OF AGE FOR ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One hundred years ago today, a bearded, one-eyed Civil War hero, erstwhile free 
love advocate and "Bible communist" by the name of James William Towner 
presided over the creation of Orange County, now a national symbol of American 
conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Towner had been a utopian visionary and socialist opponent of private property 
back East, where he had lived until his move to California seven years earlier. 
But in his new home, Santa Ana, he had become a landowner, an innovative farmer 
and the city attorney. And soon, elected Orange County's first Superior Court 
judge, he would prove to be tough on crime as well. 
</P>
<P>
His selection by the governor of California to organize the June 4 election, in 
which the southeastern corner of Los Angeles County seceded, was a 
perspicacious beginning for a county that would be torn for the next century by 
a twin impulse to provincial conformity and constant change. 
</P>
<P>
What is now the premier theme park of the American dream, the largest base of 
conservative votes in the nation, the world's 27th-strongest economy and one of 
its most important high-tech centers, was then a sleepy, cattle-grazing desert. 
But over ensuing decades it would shudder periodically in the throes of social 
revolution brought on by massive economic growth and counter-revolution fueled 
by the dislocation of entrenched classes and values. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the county would often be at war with itself as it attempted to 
define the frontier dream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County's Contradictions 
</P>
<P>
Was that dream represented by a cosmopolitan import like Towner and his 
"Townerite" followers or by the lynch mob that dragged a prisoner from his 
jail? 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, was the county best represented by the energetic merchants of 
Anaheim, who sought to build a metropolitan center of commerce, or by the 
virulent Ku Klux Klan? 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s, was its theme Disneyland, suggesting an America without conflict, 
or the John Birch Society, trumpeting the call to political Armageddon? 
</P>
<P>
And now, is Orange County most clearly the new international headquarters of 
multinational corporations, or the last bastion of America First provincialism? 
</P>
<P>
The journey from Towner's Orange County with its 13,000 rural residents to the 
exploding 2-million-strong exurbanite center of today has not been a simple 
one, but there are some continuous, if quirky, lines to be followed. One is 
that the continual and massive change in the county's population base has 
resulted in a constant reinvention of myth and place. The result has been a 
political leadership fitfully connected to the passions of the moment rather 
than to local history. 
</P>
<P>
From its first days, the county has constantly redefined its history and 
standards in a way that no New England town, for example, would tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First in a Trend 
</P>
<P>
And, in the spirit of the frontier, there is the easy assurance of each new 
generation of civic activists that the revision is the only one consistent with 
the traditions of the place. 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, Towner, the displaced social visionary who presided over the 
county's first election, was merely the first in a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Spencer Olin of the University of California at Irvine, who has 
documented the activities of Towner and other former "Bible communists" in 
Orange County, is not sure whether California Gov. Robert W. Waterman knew of 
Towner's leading role in the Berlin Heights Free Love Community of Ohio or in 
New York State's radical socialist community, Oneida, when he appointed Towner 
to the commission to organize the county. Or if Waterman knew that the 
Townerites, about 40 followers of this charismatic visionary, had collectively 
purchased major holdings in Santa Ana, including the land on which the Orange 
County Courthouse would later stand. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1880s, the local Santa Ana Weekly Standard had warned that the 
Townerites might be about creating a new Oneida, Mormon, or free love community 
and that "it will be a good idea for parents to keep their eyes on their 
daughters and husbands on their weak wives." But that concern soon blew over. 
</P>
<P>
The Townerites paid their taxes, farmed their land, developed new strains of 
citrus and designed Santa Ana's sewer and water system. They might be a bit 
off, but they were white, Protestant, prosperous -- and they belonged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elected Chairman 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, Towner was simply taken by the governor for what he, by then, was 
-- a respectable citizen, a pillar of a young, growing economy and a war hero 
who had lost his eye in the battle of Pea Ridge, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Towner was elected by his colleagues as chairman of the 
commission organizing the vote on a new county, and succeeded in uniting the 
politicians of the towns of Orange, Anaheim and Santa Ana -- who had been 
squabbling over which community would become the county seat -- long enough to 
stage Orange County's first election. (Anaheim residents feared losing power to 
Santa Ana, with its three times larger population of 3,600.) 
</P>
<P>
In the end, fewer than 3,000 citizens voted, but they approved the creation of 
the county by a 5-1 margin, and picked its first leaders, including Towner as 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
And so it came to pass that on June 4, 1889, the inhabitants of the 
southeastern end of Los Angeles County, mostly grouped around the excitable 
hamlet of Santa Ana, voted to secede, fulfilling the requirements of a bill 
that had cleared the state Legislature some three months earlier, largely as a 
result of bribes paid by resourceful Santa Ana merchants and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The best source on just how much the Legislature's vote cost is still a 
50-year-old University of Southern California master's thesis by William W. 
Wieman, who was told by Santa Ana grocery store owner George Edger: "Hell, yes, 
we bought this county from the state Legislature for $10,000, and I went out 
and raised the money myself in two hours and it was a rainy morning at that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Estimate May Be Low 
</P>
<P>
The Edger quote is now part of unquestioned Orange County folklore, but Wieman 
notes that Edger's remark was made in an interview 35 years after the event and 
the old man's estimate was probably low. 
</P>
<P>
Later generations might not approve bribing the Legislature, but hustling 
government authorities has always been a favorite pastime in a county dependent 
upon real estate lawyering from the earliest subdivision of the Spanish land 
grants to the current pleading for zoning variances. In fact, the main argument 
for separating the County of Orange from Los Angeles County was that citizens 
could gain local control of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the price, the Santa Ana lobbyists accomplished just that, creating a 
new Board of Supervisors and new courts while presenting their L.A. rivals with 
a fait accompli. The Los Angeles papers, including this one, opposed the 
secession, but in the end they bade farewell to what the Herald called "our 
wayward sister." 
</P>
<P>
There was some grumbling, but Orange County is by Western standards small -- 
785 square miles -- and most people in Los Angeles did not seem to notice their 
southern neighbors' secession. What would one day be one of the hottest real 
estate markets in the world slipped out of their hands without much of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
For the secessionists, the reasons for parting were clear and have a 
contemporary resonance. They were being taxed to help solve L.A's problems, 
which they felt were not their own. And they hated the commute required to go 
complain about it. A trip on the once-a-day train to the Civic Center was 
costly ($2), lengthy and uncertain, and the more hectic life of the emerging 
metropolis had little they wanted as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
In their southern colonies and small agricultural plots, they had ample work 
and commerce. And, as is still true today, when their hamlets grew too large, 
they moved further away from Los Angeles to even more rural residences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Hicks 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they were not hicks. From its first days, Orange County provided 
a model of modernization without urbanization. During most of its 100 years, 
the county has been plugged into the latest in scientific agriculture and 
transportation, even if artistic amenities were for a long time considerably 
less in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
For excitement and escape, then as now, even relative sophisticates like Towner 
seemed drawn in their leisure hours to the wooden beach houses of Newport 
rather than to the attractions of teeming downtown Los Angeles. One of the few 
surviving photos of Towner depicts him, thin and serene in a proper two-piece 
bathing suit, in front of one such beach house, gazing out at the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The first act of government, as described by county historian Jim Sleeper, was 
the sound of a deputy sheriff's voice bellowing out in Towner's law office, 
"Hear ye! Hear ye! The Superior Court of Orange County is now in session for 
the transaction of business." 
</P>
<P>
In his lively book on this period, Sleeper provides evidence that Towner, 
whatever his libertine social theories, and although a Democrat in "the 
sovereign Republican County of Orange," was a tough law-and-order man. 
</P>
<P>
The first felony conviction in the county was leveled by Judge Towner against 
the hapless Modesta Avila, "whose livelihood," Sleeper wrote, "depended more on 
her charms than her wits." Other historians regard Avila as a more heroic 
figure, who challenged the right of the Santa Fe railroad to run near her 
house. For the crime of spreading her laundry on the tracks and delaying a 
train, Towner sent Avila to San Quentin on a three-year stretch, where she died 
two years into her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge was evidently not tough enough for the vigilantes who performed 
California's last lynching, in 1892, rather than wait for him to return from a 
trip and try the murder case of one Francisco Torres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lynching Condoned 
</P>
<P>
In a portrait of the county's leading newspaper editor of the time, Sleeper 
quotes his editorial, which essentially condoned the lynching, replete with the 
prevailing racism of the time: 
</P>
<P>
"Torres was a low type of the Mexican race, and was evidently more Indian than 
white. True to his savage nature, he had no more regard for human life than for 
the merest trifle. The sooner such savages are exterminated the better for 
decent civilization." 
</P>
<P>
This example of an impulse for tough law and order to end in racism was not 
uncommon in the county's history, which has been marked by a pugnacious 
provincialism, and by a desire to avoid the turbulence of the larger American 
culture by excluding the nation's "problems" and "problem groups." 
</P>
<P>
The reign of the Anaheim klan is one example. In 1924, candidates sponsored by 
the Ku Klux Klan swept the municipal elections in Anaheim. The klan presence 
would extend throughout Orange County for the next decade, but the immediate 
effect in Anaheim was to send this growing citrus-trade town into an economic 
tailspin for a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
And it is still recalled as a major event. In a recent interview, Raymond 
Watson, Irvine Co. vice chairman, mentioned the klan legacy as a reason that 
blacks were not attracted to Orange County at the time he helped create the 
city of Irvine in the early 1970s. And Richard O'Neill, one of the county's 
largest landowners and a leader of the Democratic Party, cited "the klan years" 
as a source of Orange County's rightist image. 
</P>
<P>
As often afterward in the county's history, provincial preoccupation collided 
with modernizing forces to leave the area torn between its images as a 
reactionary backwater and a more cosmopolitan business center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine Report 
</P>
<P>
This tension was outlined in a massive UC Irvine report by Leonard Moffitt in 
1967. The campus was then in its infancy and its first chancellor, Daniel 
Aldrich, commissioned the study, circulated internally, to assess the temper of 
the community in which the school would operate. What emerged was a history of 
a society that moves inevitably toward urbanization while just as continuously 
resisting it. 
</P>
<P>
Moffitt cited the Anaheim klan experience as an important manifestation of that 
contradiction: "In this milieu of growth expectations, Anaheim's population 
doubled between 1919 and 1924. Businessmen had reason for optimism. BUT! Just 
when they had their first industrial concern lined up to come to Anaheim, 
something happened to make it locate elsewhere. Something happened which sent 
Anaheim into a quarter-century of stagnation." 
</P>
<P>
That something was the klan takeover. Although the klan was certainly white 
supremacist and restricted its membership to Protestants, it did not base its 
appeal on overt racism. The black and Jewish populations of the county were 
infinitesimal, and most of the Catholics were of Mexican origin and already 
living culturally apart from the mainstream. The klan, nationally, thrived on 
fighting against a presumed conspiracy of the powerful. It was difficult to 
make a case that anyone other than white Protestants had power in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the klan turned to puritanism for its sense of moral rage and began by 
making a call for strict enforcement of Prohibition laws the heart of its 
program. It looked for Catholic conspiracies behind drunkenness and lawlessness 
and had a field day ballyhooing a rise in crime, despite evidence to the 
contrary, in cities like Fullerton, where some Catholics were in the elite. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, Prohibition pitted the original, often German, settlers, who were 
fond of their beer and wine, against newer arrivals from the Midwest who were 
more likely to heed the call of abstinence. The klan campaigned on this issue 
all over the county, but it was in Anaheim that it had its greatest success, 
sweeping all four council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all the members of the Anaheim police force, including the chief, 
were klansmen. During that summer of 1924, between 10,000 and 20,000 klansmen 
descended on Anaheim (pop. 11,000) for the biggest klan rally ever held in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right-Wing Image 
</P>
<P>
"I remember hearing about how they had marched through the streets of Anaheim," 
said O'Neill, the Democratic leader. "They were marching down the street and 
carrying rifles and guns." If many of the marchers were from elsewhere -- 
including the klan marching band of Santa Monica -- the image of Orange County 
as rightist and paranoid had been cast. 
</P>
<P>
The war on decadence and crime are recurring themes in Orange County life, but 
in the final analysis, the klan could go nowhere because it was at odds with 
modernization, indeed with capitalism. Prohibition could not withstand the 
onslaught of consumer sovereignty and it proved no more possible to police the 
speak-easies of Anaheim than the brothels of Seal Beach's "joy zone." 
</P>
<P>
In a detailed dissertation for UCLA on the Orange County klan, Christopher 
Cocoltchos argues that klan members, like religious fundamentalists, were 
responding to the rapid social change in the area with a call for social 
rigidity. "The klan in northern Orange County sought to balance economic growth 
with a concern for a moral, character-developing, civic culture," he writes, 
but it failed to understand that "growth, boosterism, and the drive toward a 
corporate economy were as much a part of the white Protestant cultural heritage 
as Prohibition." 
</P>
<P>
After 1924, a coalition of Anaheim's elite and two major newspapers defeated 
klan candidates in election after election, but the town remained deeply 
divided and economically stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was not elections but highways that changed Anaheim and Orange 
County. The new Santa Ana Freeway from Los Angeles was extended to Anaheim by 
1951 and with it the start of a massive population and economic boom. The 
revival was certified in 1955 by the opening of Disneyland and was capped 11 
years later by the move from Los Angeles of the California Angels, who outdrew 
the other American league teams in attendance during their first year. 
</P>
<P>
That was when Anaheim finally realized the dream of its early boosters and 
surpassed Santa Ana as the county's largest town. It was no wonder, given its 
history with the klan, that here, as in the rest of the county, most of the 
newcomers continued to be white and Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White Flight 
</P>
<P>
This tendency was reinforced in ensuing years as the wrenching fight over 
school busing in Los Angeles turned Orange County into a haven of white flight 
and shored up the conservative electoral base. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative impulse in Orange County came early to be identified with 
Republicanism and in the 1920s, the GOP was getting more than three-quarters of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Depression, which saw 15% welfare rates in the county, gave Franklin D. 
Roosevelt slim majorities in 1936 and '40. But the vote has gone back to the 
Republicans ever since, except for Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s first gubernatorial 
campaign in 1975, when he was thought of as a fiscal conservative. The 
Democrats briefly enjoyed a majority in voter registration, but lost it when 
Brown appointed Edison Miller, a controversial anti-war former Vietnam POW, to 
the county Board of Supervisors in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a number of serious academic studies have demonstrated that the 
county's historic conservative electoral reputation is too simple a 
formulation. Liberal Republicans often did better than conservative ones. For 
example, Earl Warren in 1950 received three-quarters of the vote for governor 
and Dwight D. Eisenhower got nearly 70% in 1952, but Barry Goldwater, leader of 
the conservative movement, took only 55.8% in the 1964 presidential election. 
And in the 1950s, Orange County had a fairly moderate delegation to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological contradictions, however, run deeper than is indicated in election 
results. The county has been "conservative" on taxation and on government 
spending for everything but freeways, but it is also often "libertarian" in its 
opposition to the public regulation of private morality. 
</P>
<P>
These contradictory tendencies were summarized in the 1967 study commissioned 
by former UC Irvine President Aldrich, with particular reference to the Santa 
Ana Register (now the Orange County Register), which strongly espoused 
libertarian ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Libertarian Editorials 
</P>
<P>
"While some conservatives demand an escalated war in Vietnam, the Register 
prints editorials critical of the draft. While some conservatives carry 
'Support Your Local Police' bumper stickers, the Register objects to government 
police supported by taxes. While some conservatives demand vigorous public 
support of morality, the Register recoils in horror at the thought of morality 
via legislation or administrative decree. While some conservatives want to 
preserve a small-town environment through city planning, the Register denounces 
zoning as outright socialism." 
</P>
<P>
The Register has since mellowed in its objection to virtually all government 
activity and now refers in its news stories to "public schools" instead of "the 
taxpayer-supported schools" as it once did. But last year its editorial page 
editor could still shock an Orange County Young Republican gathering by 
advocating the legalization of drugs at a time when the Republican 
Administration had made the war on drugs one of its key programs. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatism, in the sense of preservation of rural, small-town values and 
certainties along with resistance to government intrusion, particularly from 
the federal government, has always struck a sympathetic chord in Orange County. 
But from the example of Towner and the Townerites on through the editorial 
policies of the Register it has also exhibited a libertarian preoccupation with 
individuality. 
</P>
<P>
During most of the county's history, these two tendencies seemed to coexist 
harmoniously enough. But, as the study for Aldrich documents, there were 
periodic breakdowns. The Ku Klux Klan experience, in the 1920s and '30s, was 
one example. In the '50s and '60s, the John Birch Society proved to be another. 
And as with the klan, the Birch Society developed in resistance to the prospect 
of rapid economic and social change. 
</P>
<P>
The dominant fact of life in the county since 1951, when the Santa Ana Freeway 
from Los Angeles came through, has been rampant growth -- the growth of 
population, roads, factories, churches -- you name it. And, once again, the 
tension between a desire to ride in the fast lane and the perceived need for a 
sturdy moral safety belt asserted itself in the form of another far-right 
political movement. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was the Birch Society, which at its peak elected a congressman and 
had at least 6,000 members locally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservatives Bolstered 
</P>
<P>
During that period, massive migration into the county -- largely Midwestern 
Republicans, Southern Democrats and white-flight refugees from Los Angeles -- 
reinforced the conservative trend. It was a time in which the county's 
still-dominant agricultural base was being overwhelmed by suburban sprawl and 
during which housing tracts replaced lima bean fields and citrus groves. But 
prosperity, a largely homogeneous middle-class white population and relative 
security seemed to once again provide fertile ground for extremist movements. 
</P>
<P>
The first target of the John Birch Society was a little-known school trustee in 
the Magnolia School District who was host to a meeting of the American Civil 
Liberties Union in 1955. As a result, three recall elections took place, and 
The Times reported that "soon the entire school district wobbled at the mere 
mention of the words 'liberal' or 'moderate." 
</P>
<P>
This was the time of John G. Schmitz and Robert Peterson, who developed 
national reputations for being tough on communism, though the hunt for "reds" 
in Orange County was limited by a lack of game. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson won the 1966 election for county superintendent of schools -- a 
position he still holds -- by capitalizing on a reputation developed through 
his tough-sounding courses on communism at Santa Ana College. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitz was a Marine Corps captain at the El Toro base who parlayed lecture 
circuit appearances on the red menace into a political career as a state 
senator and later became a one-term U.S. congressman. 
</P>
<P>
But with the erosion of the Cold War as an emotional organizing point for the 
right, once again external events overwhelmed local provincialism. This began 
in earnest with Richard M. Nixon's visit to, and subsequent recognition of, 
Communist China in 1972. Nixon, who came from nearby Whittier, had impeccable 
conservative credentials, but his actions threw the John Birch Society, which 
was named after an early victim of Red China, into a tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nixon Denounced 
</P>
<P>
Schmitz denounced Nixon's trip to China as a betrayal and suggested that he 
stay there. Nixon returned the favor by finding a successful opponent for 
Schmitz's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, as in the past, the extremists seemed to self-destruct. Schmitz, 
who had returned to the state Senate, became embroiled in enormously untidy 
domestic disputes and is once again a community college teacher, out of office 
and power. 
</P>
<P>
In the post-Birch years, conservatism came to be identified almost exclusively 
with the much more centrist and solid figure of Ronald Reagan, who launched 
both of his successful presidential campaigns from Orange County. Nor did 
Reagan's moderating of his domesticand foreign policy agenda, including his 
opening to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in any way mitigate his popularity 
here. The county seems periodically willing to cock an ear and even a 
respectful glance towards extremism, but quite easily settles back into 
moderation. 
</P>
<P>
The distance between a Schmitz and a Reagan is comparable to that between the 
klan and the Anaheim business elite in an earlier period. And the question 
persists as to which represents the true conservative impulse that so heavily 
marks the Orange County experience. 
</P>
<P>
Recently a group of scholars at UC Irvine and other California universities 
prepared a detailed study on the social transformation of Orange County since 
World War II, to be published next year, which, in part, attempts to answer 
that question. They emphasize that a persistent modernizing tendency has always 
been at odds with the traditional conservative impulse. 
</P>
<P>
But now the modernizing tendency has become a full-blown embrace of a new 
economic syndrome; the information economy, dominated by multinational 
corporations with few regional ties, in which Orange County is a national 
leader. The UC Irvine School of Management boasts that Orange County "has the 
highest concentration of high-tech companies in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Values Defined 
</P>
<P>
A hundred years ago, when Towner arrived in Santa Ana from the far more 
cosmopolitan East, it was relatively easy to forget all of the wild new ideas 
he had encountered there. Settling into a secure and cohesive agricultural 
village, he could quickly absorb its prevalent values, which were then clearly 
defined. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, however, the center of life in Orange County is represented by John 
Wayne Airport, which is undergoing a massive expansion, and the new office 
buildings and hotels that surround it make up the ever-changing village. 
</P>
<P>
The county has become what UC Irvine historian Olin, in his chapter of the 
forthcoming campus study, calls "an epicenter for global capitalism," in which 
the "small-scale farmers, local merchants, and manufacturers who previously 
wielded economic and political power" have been displaced. 
</P>
<P>
This information economy attracts an increasingly sophisticated and often 
foreign-born work force. Its members owe their allegiance to a company that can 
whisk them and their families off on short notice to another branch thousands 
of miles away. This new milieu is not one that easily sustains provincial, 
conservative values and, as a result, contradictions continue to tug at Orange 
County's political soul.

AS SPEAKER, FOLEY PLANS TO QUELL PARTISAN FIGHTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before Jim Wright officially steps down as Speaker of the House this week, 
his likely successor, Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington, is already 
laying plans to quell the partisan warfare that led to Wright's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, 60, who is virtually certain to be chosen as the nation's 
highest-ranking Democrat when the party caucus meets Tuesday, is viewed by 
members of both parties as a leader whose congenial personality and keen 
intellect make him better suited than Wright to oversee the House during an era 
of political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Bitterness 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Foley expressed confidence that a new Democratic leadership 
team can successfully defuse the bitterness that has developed between 
Republicans and Democrats in the House during the furor over Wright's alleged 
financial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to work very seriously at restoring a sense of comity and 
confidence between members of the two parties," Foley said. "This is going to 
be done only because both parties want it, at least the vast majority of both 
parties want it." 
</P>
<P>
As Speaker, Foley's strategy to restore order in the House would be four-fold: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To show more courtesy than his predecessor toward the Republican minority, 
which complained bitterly that its rights were denied by Wright's high-handed 
style of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To dissuade his fellow Democrats from seeking revenge against Republicans 
-- particularly Assistant Minority Leader Newt Gingrich of Georgia -- who 
brought Wright down. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To develop a bipartisan proposal for rewriting House rules that govern 
ethical conduct, making them both more stringent and less ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To refocus attention on such pressing national problems as reducing the 
budget deficit, improving education, aiding the underclass, limiting health 
care costs, raising the minimum wage, providing child care, renewing the Clean 
Air Act and bailing out the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said his efforts will succeed primarily because most House members are 
fed up with the partisan battling over personal ethics, which has not only 
brought about the resignations of Wright and Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) in the 
last 10 days but also most recently touched Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), 
the leading contender to replace Coelho as assistant majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Members on both sides don't seek election and come to Congress for the purpose 
of deciding ethical questions or engaging in ethical disputes," he said. 
"That's not what they want to do. In fact, if I've heard one thing more than 
anything in recent weeks it is -- usually with some expletives -- 'I didn't get 
elected to get involved in this kind of thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Foley, who in 25 years as a congressman has developed a 
reputation as a conciliator, does not underestimate the difficulty of the task 
facing him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people on our side who are very bitter about what they regard as the 
crucifixion of Jim Wright," he acknowledged. "There are Republicans that think 
they've been unfairly accused of that and the Democratic majority is guilty of 
creating a system in which they didn't have an opportunity to present issues 
or, indeed, a fair chance at becoming a majority. Somehow we've got to take 
care of both extremes." 
</P>
<P>
In Wright's farewell address last Wednesday, the retiring Speaker apologized to 
House Republicans for what they viewed as the excesses of his 2 1/2 years at 
the helm. It is widely believed that Gingrich would not have brought charges of 
misconduct against Wright if he had been more generous in allowing Republicans 
to offer more amendments to legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Foley emphasized that he does not share Republican criticism of 
Wright, whom he staunchly defended throughout the yearlong investigation, he 
clearly understands why the GOP is complaining and would feel an obligation as 
Speaker to resolve those complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't happen to believe that this has been a long series of oppressive 
violations of the rules or torturing of the rules by Democrats," he said, "but 
I recognize that many Republicans feel that way. And I also recognize that 
there have been cases where we have overreached, if not violating the rules, at 
least pushing them." 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 29, 1987, has long been cited by Republicans as Wright's "day of infamy" 
-- the day he adjourned the House after narrowly losing a key vote and then 
quickly called the chamber back into session, brought up a similar bill and 
eked out a one-vote victory by pressuring a fellow Texas Democrat, Rep. Jim 
Chapman, to vote his way. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could do that day over, I'd be the happiest person in the world," Foley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Foley rejected Republican charges that the Democrats have created "an 
incumbency machine" that has kept the Republicans in the House minority for the 
last 35 years. He noted that 93% of House seats have turned over since he was 
elected in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
As Speaker, Foley pledged to protect the rights of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a need to establish a sense here that we can have debate, we can have 
disputes, they can even be charged with emotion and with conviction, and still 
have a sense that after everything is decided, the rules were fair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Foley would press ahead with a bipartisan effort that is already 
under way to reform House rules. Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), who co-chairs 
the rules task force with Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), said last week he hopes 
the panel will produce a proposal for revamping House rules by September. 
</P>
<P>
Foley thinks the effort will heal partisan differences over how the current 
rules should be interpreted. "There is no reason to have partisan divisions 
over ethical procedure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even though he disagrees with Democrats who want to avenge 
Wright's ouster, he indicated that he would not favor granting "amnesty" to 
members currently facing ethics charges. That includes Gingrich, who, like 
Wright, has been accused of developing a scheme to disguise personal 
contributions from wealthy supporters as book royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Like many colleagues, Foley is looking forward to refocusing the attention of 
the House away from ethics and onto policy. But he conceded there is little 
opportunity for the current Congress to establish the impressive legislative 
record of the 100th Congress, which adjourned last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That Congress, with all credit to Jim Wright's leadership, faced, addressed 
and resolved literally dozens of legislative issues, including major ones -- 
environmental issues, resources issues, civil rights issues, drug enforcement 
issues, welfare reform issues and trade issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It tended to exhaust or fulfill the existing capacity for consensus or 
resolution. What you have left in this Congress is the residue of that agenda, 
which is by definition more difficult, more intractable, farther from 
resolution." 
</P>
<P>
In this category he listed the budget deficit, clean air legislation, child 
care, the minimum wage, federal health benefits, education and the savings and 
loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"This Congress is struggling with the hard, unfinished business of the 
country," he said. "This Congress is going to be more managerial in dealing 
with some of these problems than initiating." 
</P>
<P>
While most House members praise Foley's ability to develop bipartisan consensus 
on difficult issues, his critics claim he is more of a conciliator than a 
leader. As a result, he is often criticized for bringing no clear Democratic 
agenda to his new job. 
</P>
<P>
But Foley, insisting he is more than "a facilitator," argued forcefully that he 
can do little to alter the heavy agenda of difficult issues already facing 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a Tom Foley agenda, it's not even a Democratic agenda," he said. 
"What we do has to be within what a Republican presidency and a Democratic 
Congress can agree to. We're going to need to find common solutions. Neither 
side is going to be able to dominate this agenda."

<P>
Chinese troops of the People's Liberation Army opened fire with automatic 
weapons early today on huge crowds of civilians in Beijing, killing at least 
100 of them and perhaps many more, according to medical and diplomatic reports, 
in a successful effort to recapture Tian An Men Square from pro-democracy 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
At least 400 people were reported wounded. 
</P>
<P>
For China, it was a fundamental turning point. The Communist Party leadership 
headed by the aging Deng Xiaoping made the decision that no matter how high the 
costs to its image at home or abroad, it had to overwhelm with a force the 
students and other demonstrators who had challenged the power and legitimacy of 
the regime. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire began shortly after midnight and continued until well after dawn. 
There was gunfire all over Beijing, from the central Tian An Men Square area to 
the areas outside the main tourist hotels to the outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the firing was indiscriminate. At about 5:30 a.m. today, for example, 
a military convoy of about 100 vehicles -- including tanks, armored personnel 
carriers, trucks and jeeps -- swept past the Beijing Hotel toward Tian An Men 
Square, firing at bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
After they reached the square, at about 5:45 a.m., heavy automatic rifle fire 
could be heard from the area, which had already been subjected to several other 
lengthy volleys earlier in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowds Won't Disperse 
</P>
<P>
At noon today, the troops had cordoned off Tian An Men Square, but crowds of 
Chinese refused to disperse. And the shooting in the square had still not 
subsidied. 
</P>
<P>
Every hour or so through this morning, troops fired volleys of gunfire in an 
apparent attempt to intimidate the crowds. Each time they did so, at least 
1,000 people or more fled from the area of Tian An Men Square. Yet other 
Chinese kept pouring into the square, many of them to resist the troops and 
some of them merely to see what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
There had been more than 100,000 Chinese civilians in the square to look at or 
join the demonstrators for democracy on a balmy Saturday evening. When the 
troops arrived and the firing began, many of them rushed out in panic. 
</P>
<P>
"Duo si le, duo si le," several of them shouted. "Many have died, many have 
died." 
</P>
<P>
It was impossible to say exactly how many were killed, but by all indications, 
the death toll was huge. 
</P>
<P>
When one line of troops crouched and opened fire on a crowd at Tian An Men 
Square shortly after 3 a.m., an American reporter saw about 50 people go down. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the shooting began, hundreds, perhaps a few thousand Chinese were 
said to have remained in the downtown area, saying they were prepared to die 
for the cause of democracy, the cause for which they began their series of 
demonstrations at Tian An Men seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guns Heard Near Newspaper 
</P>
<P>
The deaths occurred not only in the center of the city, but in outlying areas. 
One foreign eyewitness heard firing shortly after dawn outside the compound of 
the Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily, in northeastern Beijing. He was 
told that four people had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in the area were so full of casualties that they scarcely had time 
for those who were not severely wounded. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy official said that there were about 70 dead and 300 wounded at 
People's Hospital in western Beijing. Another eight dead and 80 wounded were 
reported at Beijing University Hospital, and there were at least seven dead at 
the Second Hospital of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casualty Estimates Vary 
</P>
<P>
One American news agency, United Press International, quoting officials and 
staff at 10 Beijing hospitals, reported that at least 156 people had been 
killed and 464 others were treated for injuries. The Associated Press said one 
hospital doctor estimated that at least 500 people had died. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital floors and downtown streets were covered with blood. In this land of 
makeshift transportation, the dead and wounded were carried off to ambulances 
and hospitals on tricycles, bicycle carts and pedicabs. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing -- a once-graceful capital covered over in recent years with new pastel 
high-rise buildings -- looked this morning something like an East Asian version 
of Beirut, a city in the aftermath of a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Buses, trucks, jeeps, and armored personnel carriers lay burning or in ruins 
along major thoroughfares. Some were People's Liberation Army vehicles 
destroyed by the residents of Beijing. Others had originally been used as 
barricades against the troops' advance and were overrun and destroyed by tanks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Shocked, Terrified 
</P>
<P>
As they saw the wreckage, residents of the city appeared shocked and terrified. 
</P>
<P>
The "Goddess of Democracy," the 30-foot sculpture built by Chinese art students 
and modeled on the Statue of Liberty, was ruined by Chinese tanks. An American 
reporter said he had been told by a Chinese eyewitness that a tank ran over and 
killed students trying to guard the statue in Tian An Men Square. The report 
could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 6 a.m. today, a small group of bicyclists rode down Changan 
Avenue towards Tian An Men Square, on their way to work or some morning 
recreation, apparently unaware of the shooting that had gone on for hours. 
</P>
<P>
When they approached Tian An Men and witnessed the destruction, the bicyclists 
turned and fled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloody Ending to Struggle 
</P>
<P>
It was a bloody ending to the long-running battle between the Chinese regime 
and the pro-democracy demonstrators -- a battle that the leadership found it 
could not win without use of lethal force. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, the regime had sought to get the demonstrators off the square but 
had been unable to do so. Two weeks ago, troops on the outskirts of Beijing 
were forced to pull back when they were blocked by massive crowds of 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
In the pre-dawn hours Saturday, People's Liberation Army forces tried to move 
into the center of Beijing, but once again were stymied by resistance from the 
city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Several violent skirmishes erupted through the day Saturday as the armed forces 
sought without success to regain control of the streets of the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warned of Use of Force 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday night, martial-law authorities termed the situation in Beijing 
"very serious" and warned that troops and police would use force against anyone 
resisting them. The Chinese regime said the military was engaged in "a serious 
political struggle that concerns the future and destiny of the state and the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
The situation on the streets turned increasingly ugly through the day Saturday. 
Pro-democracy students were joined by workers wielding metal pipes and sticks. 
Some Beijing residents overturned buses and jeeps and smashed them. Saturday 
night, demonstrators at Tian An Men Square set fire to an army tank. 
</P>
<P>
In one bloody fracas, several hundred green-uniformed PLA troops clashed 
Saturday night with young men wielding metal pipes and sticks just off Tian An 
Men Square in front of the Beijing Hotel. In another incident, about 5,000 PLA 
troops were surrounded and pelted with bricks, stones and bottles outside the 
Great Hall of the People, on the western side of the square. 
</P>
<P>
The government-controlled New China News Agency said that Beijing residents 
besieged a military vehicle and began carting off arms from inside it. PLA 
troops used tear gas to recover the vehicle, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized Bars, Bricks 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Beijing's Public Security Bureau said that a crowd of about 
1,000 people had seized steel bars and bricks from a local construction site. 
</P>
<P>
By early today, hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents were on the streets, 
seeking wherever possible to block, pin down and frustrate the troops. PLA 
units were surrounded and halted at several points, both on the outskirts of 
the city and inside the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the People's Army. This is the traitors' army," one group of young 
men shouted to one bewildered contingent of young soldiers seeking to enforce 
martial law in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of Political Moves 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of any new effort to bring about a political settlement that 
might end the pro-democracy demonstrations and the intense power struggle 
within the Chinese Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
In an "urgent public notice" issued Saturday night, the martial-law authorities 
appeared to acknowledge for the first time that some of the PLA troops have 
been resisting orders to move against the population of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"PLA troops must carry out the martial-law tasks as planned, and none should 
prevent them," said an announcement by the authorities. "Should they be 
prevented, the martial-law enforcement troops will take various self-defensive 
measures and all means to remove the resistance." 
</P>
<P>
The martial-law announcement also asserted that some Beijing residents had 
seized arms and weapons and had beaten or kidnaped Chinese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing chaos, there was virtually no sign of any political 
leadership in Beijing. For all intents and purposes, the ruling Communist Party 
was without a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, the country's paramount leader, remained out of sight, making at least 
plausible the unconfirmed reports that he has been hospitalized with a heart 
attack. Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang also has not been seen 
since May 19, when he refused to go along with the decision to impose martial 
law here. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, China's state-controlled television network opened its 
nightly news show by showing Premier Li Peng reading a speech on the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Li Looks Tense, Grim 
</P>
<P>
Li, the unpopular hard-line leader who announced the imposition of martial law, 
looked tense and grim. He was also astonishingly isolated. In a manner 
virtually unprecedented for Chinese television, Li was shown reading his speech 
alone, with no Chinese leaders alongside him and no audience listening to him. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Saturday, the situation in the central Beijing area around 
Tian An Men Square grew increasingly chaotic as Chinese troops engaged in 
several brief, rough confrontations with the demonstrators surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, when several thousand unarmed troops first sought to 
march from the outskirts of Beijing into the Square, they retreated when their 
path was blocked by thousands of demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-morning Saturday, a second effort by a smaller PLA contingent was 
similarly unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops Became Divided 
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the troops emerged from a subway stop at Jianguomen, 
less than a mile east of the square, and headed downtown. But they became 
divided on the way downtown and failed to arrive there with force strong enough 
to move against the pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The seeming inability of the troops to gain control of Tian An Men Square on 
Saturday left the impression of an army with little leadership and low morale. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese soldiers were mostly young men from the countryside. Some of them 
were unable to speak Mandarin, the government-mandated national language. Some 
carried food rations whose dates showed that they were at least one or two 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
In several instances, there were no squad or unit leaders in sight for the 
troops during their retreat Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Soldiers in Tears 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses saw young Chinese soldiers breaking into tears as they were 
confronted and berated by residents of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are really only two explanations," said one Western European diplomat. 
"Either the army was ordered to clear the square and was unable to do it. Or 
this was a deliberate attempt to undermine the leadership which declared 
martial law." 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday afternoon, however, the PLA troops stopped retreating and began to 
show a willingness to move forward against the pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
One contingent of about 5,000 troops emerged from the west side of the Great 
Hall of the People, the entrance on the opposite side of the building from Tian 
An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Engaged in Tense Standoff 
</P>
<P>
They were soon engaged in a tense standoff with thousands of demonstrators, who 
eventually surrounded the troops. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst outbreak of violence up to that moment in the seven-week-long 
crisis, young people threw stones, bricks and bottles at the troops. In at 
least a few cases, an eyewitness said, troops picked up the stones and threw 
them back. Several demonstrators were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a short distance away at the entrance to Zhongnanhai, the compound 
where the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party live, a crowd of several 
thousand demonstrators gathered and stood face-to-face with steel-helmeted PLA 
troops standing three-deep in front of the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Use of Tear Gas 
</P>
<P>
It was outside Zhongnanhai that the troops for the first time began using tear 
gas. But this tactic failed to disperse the crowd, which by late Saturday 
afternoon extended out into the main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sunny, hot afternoon, and tens of thousands of Beijing residents 
getting out of work for the weekend pedaled their bikes through Tian An Men 
Square to see or take part in the pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
By early Saturday night, some of the confrontations began to ease. Shortly 
after 8:30 p.m., the troops that had earlier been surrounded behind the Great 
Hall of the People quietedly retreated inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, some of these troops expressed open sympathy for 
the demonstrators. At one point, some of the PLA troops and the Beijing 
residents surrounding them joined in a song, with one of the soldiers serving 
as musical director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urged to Stay Inside 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by martial-law authorities Saturday night urged the population 
of Beijing to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, please do not come onto the streets, and do not go to Tian An Men 
Square," said the announcement. " . . . The residents should stay at home, so 
as to secure the safety of your life and to avoid unnecessary losses." 
</P>
<P>
The army, however, made no effort to set up roadblocks or barricades that would 
keep people from venturing downtown. And throughout the evening, young men and 
women on bicycles streamed towards Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1:45 a.m.: Lights in Tian An Men Square are doused. Tanks and trucks move into 
north end of square. Shots are heard. 
</P>
<P>
Crowd starts to flee east. Some run into the Forbidden City, the old Imperial 
Palace complex north of square. 
</P>
<P>
2:30 a.m.: Troops in square fire at demonstrators, who hit the pavement. Within 
an hour, troops open fire again and surround the square. 
</P>
<P>
3:30 a.m.: Soldiers take control of Tian An Men. 
</P>
<P>
4 a.m.: Students announce over loudspeaker: "You have to give up all hope." 
Then, moments later: "We can't let any more blood flow . . . We must leave." 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, troops clear center of square around the Monument to the 
People's Heroes. 
</P>
<P>
2/ 
</P>
<P>
5:30 a.m.: 100-vehicle military convoy moves west along Changan Avenue past 
Beijing Hotel toward square. As it passes, shots are fired every few seconds at 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
5:45 a.m.: Automatic rifle fire is heard for several minutes from the direction 
of square.

ADVENTURER, 11, READY FOR FLIGHT AROUND GLOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Aliengena, an 11-year-old San Juan Capistrano boy with a flair for video 
games and a tendency to airsickness, will climb into the cockpit of a 
single-engine plane Monday and embark on a seven-week odyssey designed to take 
him around the world and into the record books. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's flight across the United States and through Canada, Iceland, Scandinavia 
and the Soviet Union will not only place him in an elite fraternity of 
aviators, but will make him the youngest pilot ever to circumnavigate the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,000-mile journey will also be significant because the boy will become 
the first Westerner in recent memory allowed to pilot a plane across the Soviet 
Union. He will be carrying "friendship" messages to Soviet children from their 
counterparts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Takeoff is scheduled from Orange County's John Wayne Airport at 10 a.m. Monday. 
Tony is due back at the same airfield on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
While in Moscow, Tony is scheduled to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and will present him with a 1,000-foot scroll bearing American 
children's signatures. The boy will then be given a scroll signed by Soviet 
youngsters, which he hopes to present to President Bush upon his return. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was Tony's idea to fly around the world and set the record, the 
driving force behind the project has been his father, Gary Aliengena, 39, a 
south Orange County real estate investor. The senior Aliengena has assembled a 
small army of volunteers and corporate sponsors to help finance and plan 
everything from hotel arrangements in the Canadian Arctic to refueling and 
plane maintenance in Soviet Siberia. Tony will be piloting his father's 
single-engine Cessna Centurion Turbo 210, a high-performance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of the trip is estimated at $142,000 and is being borne partially by 
members of an entourage of 17 people in Tony's plane and two chase planes, as 
well as by donations raised by the Children's Center for International 
Relations, a nonprofit organization in El Toro that was set up to help finance 
the event. The organization is run by volunteers and some paid employees who 
have been working to coordinate the so-called "Friendship Flight '89" project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He'll Have Company 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Tony in his plane will be his father, mother and 9-year-old 
sister, Alaina, as well as a Soviet pen pal and an observer from the National 
Aeronautic Assn., a private group which verifies world aviation records. 
</P>
<P>
Tony began learning to fly at age 4 on his father's lap during weekend family 
outings to the Utah Rockies and Mexico's Baja Peninsula. His first aviation 
record, set on March 13, 1988, was as the youngest person to fly solo in an 
aircraft. Unable to fly alone in a power plane because he was not yet 16, Tony 
piloted an ultralight aircraft to set that record. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a month later, Tony broke two more aviation records by becoming the 
youngest person to fly across the United States and the youngest to fly across 
and back. His achievements are noted in the National Aeronautic Assn.'s latest 
book on world and U.S. aviation and space records. 
</P>
<P>
Tony insists that it is not a love for flying that pushes him to excel in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't like to sit in a car," he said matter-of-factly.

Howling winds bellowed down the mountain into town, flapping shingles on 
weathered homes and stores, tugging at walls and windows with fierce force, 
hurling dust through empty streets. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was home. Nobody but a park ranger is ever home in Bodie, abandoned 
since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Above the town, on Bodie Bluff, the wind had a different sound, a gusty 
sonorous whine mixed with the unceasing hum of three drilling rigs. 
</P>
<P>
It is the discordant noise from the drilling rigs and the sight of mining 
equipment and trucks on the hill hovering over Old Bodie that has many people 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, fears are being voiced that this remote Mono County ghost town may 
be damaged or devastated by the very thing that created it -- gold mining -- 
and by the very family that fought to save it for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Busy Day and Night 
</P>
<P>
Since last September, crews operating exploratory drilling rigs a few hundred 
feet above town have been busy day and night taking deep core samples. Galactic 
Resources, a Canadian mining company headquartered in Vancouver, is tracking 
veins of gold missed in the past, trying to determine whether the deposit is 
rich enough to mine. 
</P>
<P>
"The mining company should not be here. People are sick about what's happening. 
Bodie is in jeopardy. It disrupts the very essence of what the Bodie experience 
is all about," lamented Donna Pozzi, 37, chairwoman of Save Bodie, a 
6-month-old committee formed by the California State Park Rangers Assn. to 
protest the mining company's presence. 
</P>
<P>
The mining firm is doing its exploratory work immediately adjacent to the park, 
on 550 acres of private land. 
</P>
<P>
A riotous gold camp, Bodie is best remembered for its reputation as the 
"wickedest town in the West" during its heyday in the 1870s to 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that most of its 150 surviving structures were erected. The town 
boasted a population of more than 10,000 -- the biggest place between 
Sacramento and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Bodie had 65 saloons. It was the home of gunslingers like Three Finger Jack and 
Johnny Behind the Rocks. Killings, robberies, stage holdups and street fights 
were part of daily life. The red-light district along Virgin Alley and Maiden 
Lane and a huge Chinatown were part of the local scene. The Rev. F. M. 
Warrington wrote in 1881: "Bodie is a sea of sin, lashed by tempests of lust 
and passion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only a Handful Remained 
</P>
<P>
More than $500 million (today's value) worth of gold and silver were gouged out 
of its diggings. By World War I, only a handful of people were left in the "top 
of the world" mining town, so called because of its 8,300-foot elevation. 
</P>
<P>
The Cain family's descendants were among the last to leave. 
</P>
<P>
They had been there since J. S. (Jim) Cain, then 25, and his wife, Lile, moved 
to Bodie in 1879. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cain brought electricity to the town over the world's first long-distance 
power line -- 13 miles from a hydroelectric plant. He made a fortune building a 
huge cyanide plant, one of the first of its kind, and extracting gold from the 
Bodie tailings with it. He wound up owning the town and the 550 acres of 
Bodie's diggings when mining ceased and everyone left. 
</P>
<P>
To his dying day, Jim Cain told his children and grandchildren never to sell 
Bodie Bluff and 9,000-foot-high Standard Hill overlooking the town because 
"there's a lot more gold in the mountain waiting to be found." 
</P>
<P>
This admonition and a love for Bodie became the Cain family legacy. 
</P>
<P>
You can hear it in the reflections of Jim Cain's 71-year-old grandson, Walter, 
as he talks about the old one-room Bodie school. 
</P>
<P>
"My desk with my name carved in it is still there," he said, going on to 
describe the last days of Bodie. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a three- or four-day wagon trip to the nearest railhead. Miners and 
their families carried only small items out with them when they left. It was 
cheaper to buy all new things than to pay the freight to haul their possessions 
out." 
</P>
<P>
All through the 1920s, '30s and early '40s, ghost towns like Bodie stood 
vacant, abandoned and ignored all over the West. But that quickly changed after 
World War II when scavengers discovered that there was money to be made on Old 
West relics. They descended on the old mining camps and carted away everything 
of value, ripping entire buildings out for timber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hired Watchmen 
</P>
<P>
"It started to happen in Bodie. My family hired watchmen to prevent the 
looting," Walter Cain recalled. "We realized Bodie was a special place and 
ought to be preserved as a historic monument. We spent years trying to get the 
state to set it aside as a park." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1962, the state paid the Cains $65,000 -- one-fifth of the 
appraised value at the time -- for the town, the huge mill where ore was 
crushed, mining equipment, all the buildings and everything in the buildings. 
Bodie became a state historic park. 
</P>
<P>
But the J. S. Cain Corp., the family-owned firm, held fast to its founder's 
admonition never to sell the 550 acres on Bodie Bluff and Standard Hill, 
convinced that an underground bonanza was there to be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Cains leased the 550 acres to Homestake Gold Mining Co. 
of San Francisco. In 1987, Galactic Resources paid Homestake $31 million for 
the lease and announced plans to rework the old Bodie diggings if enough gold 
was found in exploratory tests to make it worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
The Cains, of course, were guaranteed a share in the riches from any strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widespread Concern 
</P>
<P>
This quest for gold has caused great concern to members of the California State 
Park Rangers Assn. and hundreds of people who have a special attachment to the 
unique ghost town tucked away in its hard-to-get-to corner of sparsely 
populated Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Cain insisted that the family has been completely up front about its 
mining plans. 
</P>
<P>
"In our agreement with the state when we sold the town of Bodie it was 
stipulated that someday mining might be resumed on our property up on the hill. 
The Parks Department knows that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cain said his family could have torn down Bodie or let others walk away with it 
but had too much affection for the old town and realized its historical value. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't want anything detrimental to happen to Bodie because of the 
mining. We have been assured by Galactic that all the mining will be done on 
the other side of the hill, out of sight and sound from the park," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Whitehead, 42, chief geologist for Bodie Consolidated Mining Co., a 
subsidiary of Galactic, has been appearing before groups in Mono County for 
several months to express the firm's concerns about Bodie and to offer 
reassurances that the mining will not harm the old town, the local watershed or 
wildlife in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Historic Treasure' 
</P>
<P>
"I realize the uniqueness of Bodie. I'm a history buff myself," Whitehead said. 
"There's not another place like it. And it is my duty and the obligation of 
Galactic Resources to make certain nothing detrimental happens to this historic 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we decide it is economically feasible to start mining, and we will know by 
the end of the year, under California's strict environmental laws we must 
submit a plan of operation in great detail with Mono County and the Bureau of 
Land Management," he said. "There will be public hearings on the matter and we 
will be seeking the advice of the public and the park before we proceed." 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, Galactic Resources has staked mining claims on 20,000 
acres of additional BLM land surrounding Bodie. That cost Galactic $350,000. 
The company projects that it will spend $5 million on its exploratory effort 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehead said Don Hardesty, a University of Nevada, Reno, professor and widely 
known authority on the mining history of the West, has been hired to locate and 
protect historic sites on Standard Hill. Wildlife biologists have been hired to 
assure the protection of sage grouse, deer, antelope, pika and other birds and 
animals that might be affected by mining activities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a dozen historic structures on the Cain property, including the 
remarkably preserved two-story Bodie Railroad Depot, that we will be glad to 
present to the park. We want to work with the park every way we can. We would 
hope visitors to Bodie would also visit our mining operations. We could set up 
a visitor center in the mining area," Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Over Open Pit 
</P>
<P>
A major cause of concern is the prospect that the company may dig an open-pit 
mine. Company officials said that if they choose that option, the pit would be 
1,100 feet wide and 2,000 feet long. Mining would continue for 15 or 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize the public's concerns because of the special nature of Bodie, but 
we want to reassure everyone that our mining activity will be invisible to 
Bodie. We will be out of sight," Whitehead said. "If we decide to open-pit 
mine, the hole will not be seen from Bodie. You won't be able to hear, smell or 
see any of our mining activities from the town. We're willing to take out a 
performance bond to guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the operation would employ at least 50 miners and perhaps as many 
as 150, he said, "It will mean a big payroll to Mono County, provide a stable 
tax base, be a major economic boost to the area," 
</P>
<P>
During the exploratory phase, the mining company has set in place bales of 
straw to hide the body of the drilling rigs, but not the masts. They are 
visible from the town. Other mining equipment and trucks are also hidden by the 
straw, except when they are moved from one place to another. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehead said that of the 160 sites selected for angle drilling to obtain 
550-foot-deep core samples to track veins of gold, half were moved to avoid 
historic sites. "Any time we encounter a pile of tin cans, broken dishes or an 
accumulation of square nails, we know a tent or cabin was located there. We 
flag the site, don't disturb it and drill at least 100 feet from it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Taint Town 
</P>
<P>
These assurances notwithstanding, there is growing concern that the search for 
gold inevitably will taint the vintage ghost town below. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing here has been restored or faked. Everything is as it was when people 
walked away from Bodie," said Jack Shipley, 44, a state park ranger at Bodie 
for six years. "Noisy modern industry destroys the Bodie experience." 
</P>
<P>
Shipley's fellow rangers share his concern. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, we have fought hard to preserve the kind of haunting feeling 
experienced at Bodie, this unique look into the past," said Don Murphy, 38, 
president of the California State Park Rangers Assn., a 25-year-old 
organization that works to preserve the integrity of state parks. "There is 
absolutely no place like Bodie on the face of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the mining. It's the whole human experience at Bodie, the hopes, 
dreams, desires of people, their way of life. This is what got California 
rolling in the first place. That heritage, all those things are important to 
preserve." 
</P>
<P>
The fear is that mining operations will shatter that atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"Blasting and heavy equipment on the hill might weaken buildings. I worry about 
dust, about noise," said Bob Macomber, 43, superintendent of the Sierra 
District of the parks department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Save Bodie Campaign 
</P>
<P>
In the forefront of the fight is the Save Bodie group, which launched a 
campaign that has prompted organizations throughout the United States to write 
the Mono County Board of Supervisors urging that no mining permits be granted. 
</P>
<P>
"If the mine opens, there will be car pools, buses, traffic, a trailer village 
perhaps. I'm very much concerned about the sincerity of Galactic Resources," 
Pozzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Mono County Supervisor Bill Reid, a retired California Highway Patrol officer 
who owns a Bridgeport bar and restaurant, said he is withholding judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind is open," he said. "The mine at Bodie would be important to our 
economy. There's no doubt about it. It would be the third-biggest employer in 
the county." 
</P>
<P>
Reid said that he and others who are concerned about the issue are going on a 
tour of mining operations this month in California and Nevada to weigh 
environmental and social concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you," he said, "no one in the county wants to harm the town of 
Bodie in any way." 
</P>
<P>
As the dispute goes on, visitors stroll the streets of this time warp in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The shelves of the Boone Store are filled with dust-covered products of the 
1920s. Spider webs hang from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street in an old hotel a 19th Century pool table sits in the lobby 
with an inch of dust waiting for players that never show. Like the Leaning 
Tower of Pisa, the Swazey Hotel looks like it will fall over any moment. 
</P>
<P>
Coffins covered with dust and spider webs stand open and ready in the windows 
of the local undertaker. 
</P>
<P>
Like a slice of history frozen in time, the town awaits a verdict.

MISLEADING SLOT MACHINES RETROFITTED, NEVADA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CARSON CITY, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 10% of Nevada's 122,000 slot machines are being retrofitted after a 
decision by gaming authorities that players were being misled by a "near-miss" 
feature into thinking they were about to hit jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
A computer within the machines was responsible for jackpot symbols appearing 
much more frequently on the pay line than random selection would dictate, 
according to testimony at a hearing. But the computer, while tantalizing 
customers with near-jackpots, does not pay off any more frequently than other 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Other slot machine makers acknowledged at the hearing that almost all machines 
are deceptive to some degree but the commission decided that these machines 
went too far. 
</P>
<P>
The retrofit order imposed earlier this year by the Nevada Gaming Commission 
gives the Japanese-owned Universal Co. Ltd. until the end of the year to alter 
its machines, including the popular "Magnificent 7," seen in many casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Some have already been altered and others are being altered on a monthly 
schedule. But the machines that have not yet been corrected can legally be used 
in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey authorities have also taken action against the Universal machines in 
Atlantic City casinos, ruling that electrical mechanics, not a computer, should 
dictate which symbols appear on the pay line. 
</P>
<P>
Gaming officials in the two states say their actions reflect a determination to 
maintain public confidence in the integrity of slot machine gambling. But 
representatives of Universal Co. Ltd. insist that all machines contain 
"near-miss" features of one kind or another and the move against theirs served 
only the interests of a leading competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Schreck, Universal's attorney, charged in an interview that "hysteria was 
built up" against Universal's technologically advanced machines and that they 
were no less random in displaying results than any other machines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Japanese Issue' 
</P>
<P>
He accused a leading competitor, International Game Technology, of making the 
matter "a Japanese issue. Their former owner made no bones about saying that 
allowing a Japanese firm into gaming was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
At a Gaming Commission hearing, the counsel for International Game Technology, 
Raymond Pike, referred to Universal as a Japanese firm, but he put his prime 
emphasis on the contention that the "near-miss" features in the Universal 
machines went far beyond the ones in other machines. 
</P>
<P>
It was agreed by all sides at the hearing that almost all slot machines are 
misleading to some degree. For instance, it has long been conceded that on a 
three-reel machine, more winning symbols are on the first two reels than on the 
third. Therefore, a player often finds that jackpot indications show when the 
first reel or the second reel stops, but it is rare to have a jackpot when the 
third reel stops. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, winning combinations often show up above or below the pay line, 
leading some players to surmise that they just missed a jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy over Universal's machines focused on the allegation that 
similarly misleading impressions were showing up on the pay line as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we (at International Game Technology) have had subliminal inducements (to 
continue playing for a jackpot) above and below (the pay line), and people see 
things peripherally, and we have lights and we have blips and we have bells and 
we have loud toots and all kinds of things that help add to the enjoyment," 
Pike said. "But we haven't toyed with the pay line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technology Available 
</P>
<P>
Schreck responded: "Whether you are two or three months pregnant, you are 
pregnant. We have the technology to do it on the pay line. They do it above and 
below the pay line." 
</P>
<P>
After hours of testimony, however, the Gaming Commission voted 4 to 1 that the 
Universal machines had stretched misleading indications too far. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Amerine, an official of the Gaming Control Board, the agency serving the 
commission in a staff capacity, urged the action, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Never before has the board or commission approved a feature within a gaming 
device that causes a specific symbol to appear on the pay line more frequently 
than its mathematical probability of occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Allen, chief of the staff's electronic services division, told the 
commission that every slot machine should allow a sophisticated player to gauge 
their chances of winning by counting the number of winning symbols appearing on 
the pay line in a large number of pulls of the lever, and then dividing to find 
the odds of a jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"With near-miss features, he can't do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote Explained 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman John O'Reilly, explaining his vote to require a retrofit, 
said he and other members of the majority were not prepared to allow a 
weighting factor to be introduced on the pay line. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioner Robert N. Peccole, who voted against the retrofit, said he 
regarded Universal's computers as the wave of the future. And he said of the 
commission's decision: "We are going to declare these machines basically 
illegal. And then we are going to leave them out there in the public (for 
months)."

FREDERIC PROKOSCH; EXPATRIATE AUTHOR, POET AND PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederic Prokosch, expatriate author, poet, professor, publisher and cultural 
attache, died Friday of a heart attack at his home at Plan de Grasse in 
southern France. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
His first novel, "The Asiatics," received critical and popular success when it 
was first published in 1935. Translated into 17 languages, the novel -- a 
semi-autobiographical account of a young American on an odyssey from Beirut to 
China -- was praised by T.S. Eliot, Andre Gide, Thomas Mann and Albert Camus. 
</P>
<P>
It was re-issued in 1983, when his last book, "Voices," was published. The 
memoirs described his encounters with Bertolt Brecht, Gertrude Stein, Thomas 
Mann, Marc Chagall, Collette, James Joyce and Andre Malraux, among others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spread His Energies 
</P>
<P>
Although Prokosch wrote other popular novels and several books of poetry, none 
received quite the acclaim of his first. Nobel author Isaac Bashevis Singer 
wrote of Prokosch that he had "not cared to husband his natural resources. . . 
. If Prokosch, like Faulkner, had limited his creative energies to one milieu, 
one region, he would certainly be counted today among the pillars of American 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, his 1968 novel, "The Missalonghi Manuscript," a fictional diary 
of the last four months of the life of the poet Byron, reawakened interest in 
his work. A reviewer for Spectator wrote that "Mr. Prokosch's Byron is 
self-sufficient, he stands up, he speaks, he acts, he thinks; and he is so 
imaginatively realized that he has as much right to do so as the real Byron." 
</P>
<P>
Among his other novels were "The Seven Who Fled," "Night of the Poor," "The 
Skies of Europe," "The Conspirators," "Age of Thunder," "Nine Days to Mukalla," 
and "The Seven Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Prokosch was born in 1908 in Madison, Wis., where his father was a professor of 
linguistics and his mother a concert pianist. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from Haverford College, obtained a Ph.D. from Yale, did 
post-doctoral studies at King's College in Cambridge and taught at Yale and New 
York University in the 1930s, while writing and publishing poetry. He later 
moved to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disliked Literary Trend 
</P>
<P>
In an interview several years ago, Prokosch said he found himself "profoundly 
out of sympathy with the prevalent flavor of the American literary scene. It is 
actually trendy, obviously commercial, and intensely publicity-conscious. I 
look back wistfully at the solitude of Emily Dickinson, of Whitman and 
Melville, our greatest writers. 
</P>
<P>
"The signs point toward a deepening vulgarization, a widening corruption by the 
media, by commerce, by vanity, by ostentatiousness. . . . It is difficult, 
isn't it, quite honestly, to visualize the arrival of a marvelous poet or a 
magnificent novelist." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his literary talents, Prokosch was an accomplished squash player 
and was the national champion of France in 1939 and of Sweden in 1944. During 
World War II, he was the cultural attache in Stockholm for the U.S. Office of 
War Information. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by a brother and a sister.

OLD GUY DOES A PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD,BY CHARLES BUKOWSKI,(BLACK SPARROW PRESS:$20, CLOTH; $11, PAPER; 239 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You used to read him, in the late '50s, in the back pages of slim literary 
magazines in the Fiction and Literature Room of the Main Library downtown. 
</P>
<P>
To be reading Charles Bukowski at all meant you weren't like the rest of 
"them." You didn't buy Frank Sinatra albums with the tinted singer posing 
against pale turquoise covers. You didn't watch Ed Sullivan. You turned up your 
nose at Milton Berle. You didn't have a television in the house! And you 
snickered at the middle-brow fiction of the day. Your parents may have invested 
in "By Love Possessed" by James Gould Cozzens, but not you. You put on your 
black turtleneck and hauled on out to the Fiction and Literature Room, waiting 
for the next monthly issue of whatever quarterlies there were, waiting for the 
next things that Bukowski had to say. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bukowski drank himself into an unattractive stupor on a regular basis 
and then wrote about it. He wasn't very fond of the ladies he slept with, but 
he slept with a lot of them, and then wrote about it. He was as old as our 
parents, it seemed: Even then, he was an old guy -- but he was as 
unregenerately messy as an unmade bed; bleary-eyed, his complexion a relief map 
of the Andes put together by a clumsy seventh-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Even from his photographs, you sensed that he took baths only on Christmas and 
Easter -- or, more correctly, in the pagan fashion -- on the summer and winter 
solstices. He was a bum. He was poor. He was cantankerous. And he wrote like a 
17-year-old angel with pink sheets and golden wings. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, Bukowski's troubles deepened. He went from being the most obscure 
of poets to something of a media product. Hells Angels on their bikes idolized 
him. He got involved in some battle-of-the-sexes triangle that played out in 
the then-extremely popular Los Angeles Free Press. The girl he left behind 
mourned long and publicly -- and then wrote an embarrassing poem to her belly, 
lying low and slack out along her thighs. (It was the '60s. People did things 
like that.) Bukowski himself seemed to reduce, to disappear, under ever-thicker 
coats of lamination as Los Angeles' "Bad Boy." 
</P>
<P>
But one time, during a television documentary of his life, Bukowski, hanging 
out in a California bungalow in Silver Lake, or Echo Park, squared off against 
the ghost of his dead Prussian father: He was the kind of man, Bukowski 
remembered, who would send his son out to mow the lawn, demanding that the lawn 
be mowed this way and that way, and that way, and this way again, so that every 
single blade of grass would be cut at exactly the same height. After the young 
Bukowski had finished the lawn, his father would come out, lie flat down on the 
sidewalk, and sight along every square inch of grass. If he could find one 
blade that still grew higher than the others, Bukowski's father would beat him 
mercilessly. "But I'm not going to say too much about him," the sluggish, 
insolent, sloppy, drunken, cantankerous poet allowed, "because whatever I do, 
that Prussian blood still runs in my veins," or so I remember those words. 
</P>
<P>
The Prussian blood always showed, in Bukowski's perfect attention to craft. But 
now, in "Hollywood," a charming, elegiac novel, the poet turns his attention to 
the weird insistence and inevitability of the American Dream. If you work 
terribly hard in America; if you keep mowing that metaphorical lawn, if you do 
your work and do your work, then success is sure to follow, like a dog follows 
you to school. In spite of all the drink, all the diatribes, all the 
disgruntled ladies he's left in his wake, success has come to Charles Bukowski. 
The Establishment has even made a movie about his life, "Barfly," with genuine 
movie stars, Mickey Roarke and Faye Dunaway. The hard-working, hard-drinking 
poet finally "went Hollywood," and "Hollywood" is his gentle, self-forgiving 
novel about that phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
We see the poet as a real old guy, Hank Chinaski, married now to Sarah, a savvy 
Nora Charles of a wife, who is apt to interrupt her husband just as he gets 
conversationally wound up: "It's one of his favorite stories," she'll say. "I 
love him, but you have no idea how many times I've had to listen to that 
story." And, yes, when they go to the movies, Chinaski must go through the 
embarrassing, all-too-familiar ritual: Two tickets, "one senior." Sarah has 
weaned the poet, (for the most part) away from hard liquor, but both of them 
are devoted to good red wine. They live a pleasing, private existence until the 
fateful day when an independent producer asks Chinaski to write a screenplay 
about his own past life, and tosses in $10,000 as advance and incentive. 
Chinaski agrees: It sounds like fun and it won't be taxing enough to keep him 
away from what has become his real vocation, spending long, lucrative days at 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
The narrative then embarks on parallel courses. A movie is being made, and the 
former avant-garde poet finds himself in the thick of that process: He meets 
the creme de la creme of film land; a French "genius," for instance, who goes 
by the moniker of Jean-Paul Modard: " . . . We poured some more wine. It was 
all really excellent. Life was good. All you had to do in their little world 
was be a writer or an artist or a ballet dancer and you could just sit or stand 
around, inhaling and exhaling, drinking wine, pretending you knew what the 
Hell." 
</P>
<P>
But Chinaski can't be so pure and aloof about his own "art" anymore. That 
$10,000 brings him his very own tax man, who assures him he has to spend his 
money before the government gets it. He and Sarah go house hunting in a place 
where they think they "ought" to be -- Topanga Canyon. A grizzled lady realtor 
with a country accent you can cut with a butter knife tries to sell them a cozy 
little cabin where some of the Manson murders came down. They end up buying a 
car instead -- a BMW. 
</P>
<P>
It goes on like that. The project's funding starts and stops a million times. 
The producer threatens literally to dismember himself in order to get the movie 
completed. But as the production begins, goes on, ends, Chinaski is hit by a 
terrible sadness. The movie is about barflys, and there was a time when 
Chinaski was a barfly. A time when there was only him and words and liquor, and 
nothing else. A time when -- all our current anti-alcohol rhetoric to the 
contrary -- Chinaski knows for sure he's done his best work. 
</P>
<P>
He and Sarah may go to screenings now, armed with their own separate bottles of 
wine, but they cannot be outrageous, because they are too successful. And 
Chinaski is old. He can watch his life re-enacted, but he can't get back in. He 
is left with the results of his life: a good woman who loves him and deflates 
him, a car that runs like a top, biker-fans who embarrass him; a respectable 
life and a distinguished body of work. Even Bukowski's exacting father might 
approve. "Hollywood" is strange, Bukowski tells us. But life is even stranger.

<P>
The girls and flowers keep changing into literature 
</P>
<P>
until that endless languid age arrives 
</P>
<P>
when all the world becomes a picture catalogue of 
</P>
<P>
gardens 
</P>
<P>
where men and women play at chess, at love, 
</P>
<P>
and every animal comes fawning to the hand. 
</P>
<P>
Then the spirit must begin once more, 
</P>
<P>
untaming everything that it has tamed, 
</P>
<P>
forgetting all that it has paid for in blood, 
</P>
<P>
until the blazoned phrases melt from the vellum 
</P>
<P>
and the gold-leaf initials turn into butterflies 
</P>
<P>
and lift off the pages, climbing into space 
</P>
<P>
to find the hidden planet all wild rose and chicory. 
</P>
<P>
Slow signals are emitted from that far system. 
</P>
<P>
The planet throbs in its orbit like a hive of sleepy bees, 
</P>
<P>
the seasons settle into an undying summer 
</P>
<P>
where poplar leaves slide in the wind 
</P>
<P>
like shoals of rainbow trout nibbling the river. 
</P>
<P>
It is a world prepared for men, 
</P>
<P>
but no one comes, each reader still entranced

by the courtly chronicle of his native world, 
</P>
<P>
the book that murmurs the secret names of lovers.

A WESTERN MONOPOLY ON TRUTH?

<TEXT>
<P>
Karl Schoenberger's title for his review of "The Enigma of Japanese Power" was 
careless and in very poor taste. By referring to Salman Rushdie's book that 
totally misrepresents the words of God, he is obviously calling the Islamic 
faith a "myth" just as he accuses Japanese authoritarianism of the same. Way to 
go! It offended and abused Japanese and Muslims in one fell swoop.

LUCIFER IN GRUNEWALD'S MASTERPIECE; 
</P>
<P>
THE DEVIL AT ISENHEIM,REFLECTIONS OF POPULAR BELIEF IN GRUNEWALD'S ALTARPIECE, 
BY RUTH MELLINKOFF, CALIFORNIA STUDIES IN THE HISTORY OF ART, DISCOVERY SERIES, 
1 (UNIVERSITY OFCALIFORNIA PRESS: $29.95; 109 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-520-06211-6)

By Jeffrey Burton Russell, Russell is the author of 13 books on the history of 
theology, including The Prince of Darkness (Cornell University Press, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This beautifully written, sumptuously illustrated, and elegantly printed work 
on Matthias Grunewald's famous altarpiece is an auspicious first volume in the 
new Discovery Series in art history from California Press. Edited by Walter 
Horn and James Marrow, the series is designed to publish short monographs 
requiring extensive illustration to develop their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
In this volume, Ruth Mellinkoff, a distinguished art historian and author of 
"The Mark of Cain," concentrates on one of the more puzzling figures of the 
famous altarpiece at Isenheim, painted by Grunewald about 1512-1516. Best known 
for its terrifying depiction of Christ's Crucifixion, the altarpiece was 
designed with two hinged sets of wings so that three entirely different views 
could be presented according to the arrangement of the wings. A total of 14 
panels appear in the three views. The famous Crucifixion appeared in the view 
when the wings were closed; the almost equally renowned Temptation of Anthony 
appeared when the wings were opened in the shrine position. At the center of 
the middle position is a picture of a musical concert given by angels in the 
presence of the Madonna and Child. In the sky above the Madonna, God sits 
enthroned among his angels, radiating spiritual light. This panel has long 
resisted satisfactory interpretation. By addressing one of its most puzzling 
figures, Mellinkoff finds a key to understanding the panel as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
In the back row of the concert of angels sits a strange, feathered, greenish 
creature, strikingly different from the other angel musicians in the panel and 
from other angels in the altarpiece. Mellinkoff is the first to demonstrate 
that this figure is the Devil himself. Unlike the other angels, who have 
feathered wings, Lucifer is almost completely covered with feathers and hair. 
Unlike the other angels, who are reddish, Lucifer is a sickly green suggesting 
decay. 
</P>
<P>
One small point here is debatable. Mellinkoff argues that the Devil's hair is 
metamorphosing into feathers, but it seems more likely that the process is the 
opposite, since iconographic tradition is that in his fall Lucifer was 
transformed from beautiful angel into hairy brute. That this Devil still has a 
sensitive face is not to be wondered at, for St. Paul said that Satan could 
take on the appearance of an angel of light, and the earliest portrait of the 
Devil in Christian art shows him in the shape of a beautiful angel. 
</P>
<P>
Most strikingly, the Devil is looking up toward the figure of God in the sky 
with an expression of horrified amazement. I have made an unthinkable mistake, 
he seems to be saying; God's power is real; I am ruined forever. It is an 
arresting, compelling face, this face of suffering Lucifer, a strange echo of 
the suffering Christ of the Altarpiece's most famous panel, and, in wider 
terms, a premonition of the protagonist of Victor Hugo's great poem "Satan" 
three centuries later. The astonishment of the Devil derives not from his 
stupidity -- he is after all an angel, the most brilliant of God's creatures -- 
but rather from his willful refusal to accept the truth. A moment after his 
creation, he refused to accept his dependence upon God the Father; and later, 
when he met Christ to tempt him in the wilderness, he refused to accept that 
this was the Son of God. 
</P>
<P>
The author confirms her argument by following a number of other clues in what 
amounts to brilliant detective work. Atop his head, Lucifer wears a strange 
crest that on examination proves to be a peacock's plumes. Mellinkoff shows 
that Grunewald would have perceived the peacock as a symbol of sinful pride and 
that other contemporary artists sometimes set a peacock's crest upon the head 
of the serpent of the Garden of Eden. She links Lucifer with the fall of 
humankind in the same panel, taking the dark fig tree in the center of the 
panel as the fatal tree of Eden. 
</P>
<P>
She identifies a number of strange little figures in the panel as demons, one 
of them, near Lucifer himself, having a peculiarly repellent face. She argues 
that the chamber pot bearing pseudo-Hebrew characters is linked with sin and 
Satan as part of the contemporary custom of demonizing the Jews who denied 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinkoff's interpretation is art history at its best; she understands that it 
is impossible to interpret a painting satisfactorily without understanding the 
mentality of the painter. As others have shown for Bosch, Mellinkoff shows for 
Grunewald that his work is not as peculiar as it at first appears but rather is 
rooted in traditional Christian theology. We now understand the altarpiece 
better than ever, and we also have a more poignant sense of the sorrow of 
Satan, elected, like Judas, to play a painful part in the drama of salvation.

<TEXT>
<P>
The two most interesting volumes to be plucked from this season's crop of art 
books are not in the conventional sense books about art. One of them is, in 
fact, about gardening; the other is what amounts to the first official 
English-language survey of the Russian Orthodox Church's incomparable 
iconographic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Though their publishers clearly intended something more serious, both books 
have the additional virtue of suggesting useful reflections on two significant 
movements in contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>
Gardening, after all, is part of a complex of current preoccupations -- like 
cooking, domestic architecture and a renewed interest in so-called traditional 
values -- that, together, constitute what might be called the revival of 
private life. Whether this trend derives from social exhaustion, the final 
triumph of narcissism or the realization of a decent sense of our own limits, 
we Americans increasingly are a people concerned with how we will live our own 
lives, educate our own children and provide for our own futures. Anyone who 
doubts this need only look at our major corporations' rush to capitalize on the 
"cocooning" phenomenon. Mikhail Gorbachev may no longer believe that history is 
economically determined, but it's an article of faith among marketing 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, that which against all odds has remained an object of belief among 
the people of the East is a matter of considerable interest in this era of 
glasnost and perestroika. One of the least understood aspects of the historic 
upheaval now underway in the Soviet Union is precisely what place Gorbachev's 
new thinking will make for the ancient traditions of the Russian church. As 
orthodox communism declines, Orthodox Christianity may reassert itself as a 
focal point of cohesive social values, national identity and, perhaps, of the 
messianic aspirations great powers seem inevitably to assume. Moscow, after 
all, was the "Third Rome" centuries before it was the capital of the Socialist 
Motherland. 
</P>
<P>
Historical speculation is fascinating, of course. But fully realized historical 
fact is far more satisfying. And in this regard, British architectural 
historian David Ottewill has made an altogether admirable success with The 
Edwardian Garden (Yale University Press: $50; 230 pp., illustrated; 
0-300-04-338-4). 
</P>
<P>
Today, when we think of an "English garden" it is invariably those of the 
Edwardian period we have in mind. Given that fact, it is hard to believe that 
Ottewill's history actually is the first comprehensive survey of the 
personalities, ideas and artifacts of this influential movement. His 
accomplishment, however, is sufficiently magisterial that no other will be 
required for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
This handsome, oversized volume from the Yale University Press was designed by 
Gillian Malpass and printed in Hong Kong, facts worth noting because of the 
unusually adroit integration of Ottewill's intelligent, but unpretentious text 
with the book's 125 excellent colorplates and 180 black-and-white 
illustrations. Many of the latter are period photographs and reproductions of 
the architects' and designers' working drawings. 
</P>
<P>
When juxtaposed with contemporary photos, as they often are, these lend real 
substance to the architect Francis Inigo Thomas' pointed admonition: "To design 
a garden is one thing, and to garden it so as to obtain the desired effect is 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Vita Sackville-West aptly described the Edwardian gardeners' approach as one 
which combined "maximum formality of design with maximum informality of 
planting." 
</P>
<P>
As Ottewill recontructs it, the Edwardian school of garden design began in a 
controversy rooted in that very dichotomy. By the late 19th Century, the 
principles of the Arts and Crafts movement were widely held among 
forward-looking Britons concerned with aesthetic issues. Among the many simple 
pleasures the movement commended to its followers were those of country living 
and the garden. Simplicity, however, is often a rather contentious thing, and 
controversy erupted over what kind of thing this new sort of garden ought to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
On the one side were the architects, who -- rather unsurprisingly -- insisted 
that the new gardens ought to be designed by architects as integral complements 
to the houses they surrounded. On the other side were the professional 
gardeners, who argued that principles derived from the experience of wild and 
cultivated nature ought to prevail over formal design. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest and most influential of the Edwardian gardens were a synthesis of 
these two views as achieved in the inspired partnership of the "amateur 
artist-gardener" Gertrude Jekyell and the her one-time pupil, the architect 
Edwin Lutyens. They were in many ways an odd couple: Lutyens, in fact, 
apparently cared little for the physical experience of gardens; each was a 
design problem to be solved before moving on to the next. It was a trajectory 
that inevitably lead away from the Arts and Crafts movement and into 
classicism. Toward the end of his career, he caustically remarked that if one 
of his wealthy clients had come into possession of the Parthenon, she doubtless 
"would have added a bay window to it." 
</P>
<P>
Jekyell, from whom Lutyens obtained an appreciation of natural building 
materials he never lost, cared for little else but gardens. The principles she 
enumerated in her many elegant writings remain for gardeners around the world 
the conscience of their endeavor. "Planting ground is painting a landscape with 
living things," she wrote, "and as I hold that good gardening ranks within the 
bounds of the fine arts, so I hold that to plant well needs an artist of no 
mean capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Edifying as all this may be -- and it is -- it is impossible to overlook the 
historical parallels between the Edwardian era and our own, which has come to 
be marked not only by a frantically acquisitive interest in Arts and Craft 
artifacts, but also an extravagant revival of formal garden building. 
</P>
<P>
Ottewill summarizes the Edwardian historical context thusly: "The purchasing 
power of the pound rose steadily. . . . There was an accompanying rise in 
consumption. Owing to the introduction of the mass market this was no longer 
confined to the wealthy, but the working mass of the population was a little 
worse off during the Edwardian period compared with the 1890s. In general, the 
situation allowed a small elite to amass, more quickly than ever before, 
immense personal fortunes. . . . Many businessmen acquired at least a semblance 
of landed status by building a new house or enlarging an old one. The 
combination of surplus resources and a plentiful supply of labor enabled both 
groups to indulge in the luxury of gardens on a scale never to be seen again." 
</P>
<P>
These, of course, were people on the edge of apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
While Ottewill fixes the Edwardian garden convincingly within an aesthetic and 
historical context, Father Vladimir Ivanov's Russian Icons (Rizzoli: $75; 219 
pp., illustrated; 0-8478-0952-8) is rather confusing in its implications. 
Father Ivanov, an orthodox priest and chairman of the Ecclesiastical Archeology 
Department at the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy, is an internationally known 
authority on icons. His book, which is meant to commemorate the 1,000th 
anniversary of the introduction of Christianity into what is now the Soviet 
Union, is visually stunning, containing 160 color reproductions of icons dating 
from the 12th to the 20th Century. According to the volume's notes, 100 of the 
icons pictured have never before been published. 
</P>
<P>
Within the context of Father Ivanov's explication, however, responding to these 
images as something other than an arresting curiousity becomes problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Among practicioners of the three great monotheistic religions, only Christians 
make religious images. In the West, those images are not only part of, but 
central to the great artistic tradition. Father Ivanov argues rather 
insistently that Russian icons stand outside this tradition -- that they are 
not simply objects worthy of veneration; that they possess inherent powers to 
protect the faithful; and serve as a kind of gateway through which the believer 
may obtain direct access to "the divine prototype." With this in mind, Father 
Ivanov insists that iconographers be judged not according to their painterly 
achievements, but on their fidelity to tradition and the creator's 
manifestation of a "tested knowledge of spiritual situations." 
</P>
<P>
Taken in this way, Russian icons present the same problems of critical 
interpretation as tribal or other primitive art: To take them out of the 
context of their creation is to deny a full understanding of their meaning; 
allowing them to remain there is to make them all but unintelligible to our 
aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, most Westerners who care about such questions have had their 
understanding of Orthodoxy, particularly Russian Orthodoxy, spirituality shaped 
by the publications of the church in exile and by the works and translations of 
Orthodoxy's influential converts, such as the late Archimandrite Lev Gillet and 
the former Timothy Ware, now Bishop Kallistos of Diokleia. The spirituality of 
those believers formed within the Soviet Union may differ from these, 
particularly in its points of emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Father Ivanov simply intended to simplify his text for a secular, 
Western audience. Even so, some ommissions are surprising. For example, despite 
several glancing references to what I take to be the Athonite doctrine of the 
Uncreated Light and its importance to Russian iconography, the name of the 
concept's author, Gregory Palamas, never appears. Is this because he remains a 
controversial and divisive figure among Western theologians? 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the discussion of the 19th-Century Russian situation lacks any 
reference to that great anthology of spiritual texts, "The Philokalia," to "the 
unceasing prayer of the heart" or Jesus Prayer and to perhaps the greatest 
exponent of both, Theophan the Recluse. All three exerted a decisive influence 
on 19th-Century Russian spirituality and it is difficult to understand how they 
could not have had some impact on icon painting. If the contemporary Russian 
church no longer considers them of great importance, it would be interesting to 
know why. 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing, however, is Father Ivanov's description of 20th-Century icon 
painting. Suffice it to say that it does not ever mention the Communist Party, 
the imposition of Soviet power or the state-sponsored persecution of religion 
believers. In a historical narrative this is something of a defect. 
</P>
<P>
From this evidence, it appears that the Patriarchate of Moscow no less than the 
Kremlin stands to benefit from a little glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Historicism seems to be breaking out all over this spring, and among its other 
notable offshoots are a pair of impressive explorations of the work of 
Francisco Goya. The more formidable of the two, Goya and the Spirit of 
Enlightenment, Alfonso E. Perez Sanchez and Eleanor A. Sayre, co-directors of 
the traveling exhibition (Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown: $65; 407 pp., 
illustrated; 0-87846-299-6, cloth;) is the catalogue designed to accompany the 
exhibition of the same name currently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York. (It previously has been reviewed by Times Art Critic William 
Wilson) As the title implies, this volume employs more than 400 pages, an equal 
number of illustrations and well-constructed essays by an impressive array of 
Spanish and American Goya specialists to document the influence of the 
Enlightenment's philosophical and political preoccupations on Goya's art. As 
the political children of that era, Americans will find this discussion of 
particular interest. 
</P>
<P>
A briefer, though intellectually bracing alternative, is provided by Janis A. 
Tomlinson's Graphic Evolutions: The Print Series of Francisco Goya (Columbia 
University Press: $29.95, cloth; $15, paper; 67 pp., illustrated; 
0-231-06864-6, cloth). Tomlinson is a Columbia University art historian and, 
while the five essays compiled here are intended for a scholarly audience, they 
will be of great interest to anyone devoted to this artist or, for that matter, 
the graphic arts. 
</P>
<P>
While not denying the significance of Goya the social critic, the author 
explores the evolution of his graphic work as it responded to the discernable 
individual impulse of the artist. This is intelligently and nicely done, 
indeed.

BLOODY SUNDAY

<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no attempt to conceal the identity of Barbara Vine as being, in fact, 
Ruth Rendell, but the name game evidently keeps her two different publishers 
happy. It also gives Rendell two voices, and the Vine novels stray even further 
from traditional crime fiction than the Rendell oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Stairs is the third of the Vines, after "A Dark-Adapted Eye" and 
"A Fatal Inversion." It is terrific: a densely textured, poetic study of murder 
once done (although of whom and by whom is teasingly withheld, the victim 
unidentified until nearly the end). 
</P>
<P>
The present as lived and the past as revealed converge like cars at an 
intersection, and in the crash . . . but that is the author's last teasing 
mystery. Vine-Rendell sets herself harder, subtler tasks each time out. "The 
House of Stairs" is something of an homage to Henry James, whose writing 
figures in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
The house was a tall walk-up (106 steps) in a decaying London neighborhood in 
the '60s and '70s. It was presided over by a rich, kind, vague woman named 
Cosette who supported an odd assortment of hangers-on. One of them was the 
narrator, a woman who writes trashy thrillers. Her fear that she may have 
inherited Huntington's chorea, the wasting neurological affliction that killed 
Woody Guthrie, lends a curious dissonant tension to the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident was a strange, hostile figure named Christabel, just out of 
prison in present time as the unfoldings begin. The handling of time is in fact 
ingenious, present and past overlapping and dissolving one into another in the 
narrator's consciousness. The identifying of the several characters and 
relationships in a peculiar house in a particular time is the work of a 
superior writer, who engenders suspense not out of arbitrary events but from 
the inexorable collision of souls. Once again the line between crime and 
"straight" fiction is not easy to discern. 
</P>
<P>
Donald E. Westlake, whose satiric send-up of check-out-stand journalism, "Trust 
Me on This," is shortly to be filmed, is probably the most consistently amusing 
of American crime writers. He, too, likes to set himself literary challenges. 
His new work, Sacred Monster, is a sparkling little set-piece in the form of a 
long interview with a booze-soaked, drug-dazed superstar, the sacred monster of 
the title. Nothing is quite what it seems, of course, to the star or to the 
reader. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's ingenuity at spinning out his tale and working his sleight-of-hand 
finale is an audacious treat. What he did to scandal sheets he has now done to 
Hollywood's bad manners and worse mores, with much the same infusion of hard 
truths. 
</P>
<P>
E. C. Ward's A Nice Little Beach Town is so close to Newport Beach (where the 
author lives) that it hardly requires a name of its own, although she calls it 
White's Bay. Her nice little but surprisingly violent tale has at its pulsing 
heart the skyrocketing value of beach properties. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly Swedish fisherman is found shot, and his tenant, an idealistic high 
school teacher, becomes the chief suspect when he and his ex-wife inherit the 
old man's newly pricey pieces of coastal turf. An outraged son-in-law, an 
irascible developer and his runaway son, a pyromaniac and assorted other thugs 
paint the town gory. A likable and urbane story, mayhem notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Blind Side by William Bayer is an offbeat item that incorporates some pictures 
ostensibly taken by the photojournalist who is narrating the story. (Bayer 
provided both words and pictures.) 
</P>
<P>
The photographer has been taking arty shots of inanimate objects since a 
traumatic battle-zone experience left him unable to photograph people. A 
seemingly chance encounter with a sexy model propels him over his block and 
into a messy world of murder, blackmail, double-crosses and redouble-crosses, 
all against a backdrop of obsessive sex, plain and kinky. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer has created a heroine of hypnotic untrustworthiness and a hero who is 
altogether too trusting but a great counterpuncher, even after he's been 
blind-sided. The story's credibility quotient is very low but its pace is fast, 
its temperature high. 
</P>
<P>
Stoney Winston, the continuing figure in a series by Jim Stinson of Pasadena, 
is a low-budget jack-of-nearly-all-film-trades, living in one of those decrepit 
houses that cling to Laurel Canyon like burrs. In Truck Shot, Winston is 
reduced (I think that's the right word) to teaching film temporarily at a 
failing art school tucked in the San Gabriel foothills. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think the school would be allowed to expire quietly, but an exploding 
kiln that kills an instructor also blows the lid off a whole paste pot of evil 
deeds, defalcations, cheating on exams, naked greed and much else. Winston is 
quickly up to his lens-cap in confusion and danger. 
</P>
<P>
Stinson, himself a sometime film writer who also does software training 
manuals, writes about jobs and geography he knows well and it lends a 
comfortable credibility to his work. Winston is an easygoing sort, a welcome 
change from the current sleuths who are either burnt-out or too wisecrackingly 
clever by half. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Sublett made a reputation as a bass player and songwriter in his native 
Austin, Tex. He now lives in Los Angeles, but his Rock Critic Murders is set in 
Austin and is marvelously enriched by Sublett's close acquaintance with the 
city's vigorous rock scene. The viewpoint, I'd say, is astringent but 
affectionate, although he makes neither the scene nor the city sound like a Boy 
Scout jamboree. 
</P>
<P>
His protagonist is a bass player, named, with unbearable appropriateness, 
Fender. A reunion of a legendary local group is loused up when the guitarist is 
murdered. A kilo of cocaine, fresh off a private plane from Mexico, is missing 
and before it is found the seekers have been dropping like flies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the losers are two tone-deaf but greedy rock critics who had evidently 
grown weary of fame and wanted money. The story as story is fairly standard 
stuff, but the density of the colors with which Sublett paints a little-used 
setting makes "Rock Critic Murders" unusually interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Vachss goes beyond hard-boiled to stories with the feel of granitic 
gravel. In Hard Candy, his fourth featuring a loner named Burke, his setting is 
again the gritty underside of Manhattan. Burke is backed by a freak show that 
suggests Doc Savage as seen through a wood-alcohol hangover. The habitat is a 
junkyard, with killer dog in place. The players include a mute named Max, a 
gent called the Prophet and a Chinese lady ever ready with ancient wisdom and 
hot information. 
</P>
<P>
A hooker wants Burke to free her daughter from a commune that corrupts rather 
than saves. The daughter is happy where she is, i.e. already lost. But Burke, 
whose M.O. is to meet malevolence with greater malevolence, never takes refusal 
for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
The style is terse and urgent, the narrative mostly side-of-the-mouth dialogue. 
Despite the backdrop of authentic urban nastiness, the goings-on are in their 
way as fanciful as the pulps or 007, but not less readable for all that. 
</P>
<P>
By wild contrast, there is The Queen's Head by Edward Marston, a trip back to 
the theater in Shakespeare's and Queen Elizabeth's time. Someone is out to 
sabotage an acting company, Lord Westfield's Men. One of the key actors is 
killed in a tavern brawl, and the company manager has to find a substitute and 
a solution. At length, Elizabeth herself is imperiled, and only a dazzling 
piece of stagecraft saves her. 
</P>
<P>
Marston, who lives in England, knows his period and his turf and provides a 
painlessly charming visit to the theatrical past.

WHERE AMERICAN INDUSTRY WENT WRONG; 
</P>
<P>
MADE IN AMERICA,REGAINING THE PRODUCTIVE EDGE BY MICHAEL DERTOUZOS, RICHARD K. 
LESTER,ROBERT M. SOLOW, AND THE MIT COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTIVITY (MIT 
PRESS: $17.95; 340 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Warren Bennis, Bennis is Distinguished Professor of Business Administration 
at USC and the author of Why Leaders Can't Lead. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an old Zen saying: First enlightenment, then the laundry. Measured by 
both the number of books sold and the quality of the recommendations therein, 
the '80s must qualify as a decade of enlightenment for American management. 
Even so, "Made in America" contributes its share. Written by an all-star lineup 
of MIT faculty, the book illuminates our No. 1 economic problem: the seriously 
declining rate of manufacturing productivity. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the American standard of living depends on productivity, on 
the amount of goods and services we produce with the available work force. As 
the Brookings Institute recently pointed out, our living standards would be 25% 
to 50% higher today if our productivity growth hadn't slowed over the past 20 
years. "Made in America" (the slogan has a poignant ring today) addresses this 
problem head on. It is a seminal study of the structural and institutional 
reasons for this decline. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the study aren't new. The list of weaknesses is the usual one: 
</P>
<P>
* Outdated Strategies 
</P>
<P>
* Short Time Horizons 
</P>
<P>
* Technological Weaknesses in Development and Production 
</P>
<P>
* Neglect of Human Resources 
</P>
<P>
* Failures of Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
* Government and Industry at Cross-Purposes 
</P>
<P>
Nor were the Commission's recommendations startling, although they are so 
thorough and detailed that they alone would make the book worth buying. 
Basically, they are to provide better education and more on-the-job training, 
treat workers as a resource rather than a cost factor, encourage cooperation 
instead of competition both within and among firms, learn to live in a global 
economy, replace the myopic, quarterly mind set with a long-range one, flatten 
hierarchies, and stay close to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
One fresh and exciting recommendation -- perhaps the most significant one -- is 
to produce superior goods, not just invent them. According to senior author 
Dertouzos, "two-thirds of U.S. research and development budgets are committed 
to investing and only one-third to finding the best way to make a new product. 
In Japan, it's the reverse." 
</P>
<P>
What makes this book remarkable, though, is its thick description and analysis 
of eight industrial sectors, two that it considered internationally competitive 
-- chemicals and commercial aircraft -- and six others that have suffered for 
the past decade or two: steel, machine tools, automobiles, consumer 
electronics, semiconductors and computers, and textiles. I know of no other 
study that stands on such a hefty empirical base or is as solidly grounded in 
the sweaty complexity of real organizational life as this one is. 
</P>
<P>
The authors took a "bottom-up" approach. Without neglecting macroeconomic or 
political/legal issues, the Commission helps us to understand what has been 
happening to American productivity "on the shop floor, in the laboratory, in 
the boardroom, and in the classroom." Members of the Commission visited more 
than 200 companies in the United States, Europe and Japan and interviewed 
almost 550 knowledgeable practitioners and analysts in industry, government, 
organized labor and universities. (Once the study was launched, a ninth team 
was formed to look into education and vocational training in various countries 
and to examine the way "companies cultivate and exploit their human 
resources.") 
</P>
<P>
But before you run to your neighborhood bookstore, let's talk about doing the 
laundry -- that is, implementing the study's specific recommendations for what 
American industry needs to regain its prominence in a global economy. The 
authors are certainly aware of the monumental set of changes this entails. They 
note that "wrenching changes at all levels of the organization" will have to be 
made if we are to keep pace with our foreign competitors. And they're wise 
enough to know that serious change means serious resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is precisely at the level of change that the study lets us 
down. For example, we are told that well-run companies reduce the number of 
layers of management and base their reward system on performance. Those are two 
sensible suggestions. They've been espoused for years -- airport bookstores are 
filled with pop management books offering the same advice. But what does it 
take for organizations to get from here to there? How do we get engineering 
schools to lengthen the typical four-year engineering program (as the report 
suggests) to make it more like law or medicine or any other professional 
school? When MIT president Paul Gray, who commissioned the study, was asked 
this question, he replied that it would not happen quickly and would take place 
only when major engineering schools all agreed to do it at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Don't hold your breath. I was once president of a university, and I'd rather 
try to move a cemetery than get one faculty committee to agree on change. 
</P>
<P>
Or take another wise suggestion from the study: move the planning focus from 
the short-term to the long-term. Talk to Nicholas Brady about that one. When he 
was asked last year what his top goal as Secretary of the Treasury would be, he 
didn't recite the litany of urgent national crises such as savings and loans 
failures, the budget deficit, or Third World debts. He said that the most 
important task was to influence United States industry to look at the long run. 
One of his first acts was to appoint a team to devise strategies to shift the 
orientation of investors and managers. Has anybody noticed any changes? 
</P>
<P>
The point the study misses is that leadership is needed, at the national level 
and the organizational level, or the laundry isn't going to get done. As 
Machiavelli pointed out, "Change has no constituency." It's the leader's job to 
create one. The flaw in this book is that it does not address the need for 
leadership to influence organizational culture, to reconstruct the scaffolding 
that shapes our values and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and magazines celebrate the nation's most respected corporations, 
invariably the same set of firms who seem to have mastered the art of managing 
in a turbulent world. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Disney, Nordstroms, 
WalMart, Chapparal Steel, Nucor, Ford Motors, Herman Miller, Motorola, Apple 
Computers, Compaq, Pepsico, and W.L. Gore are among a handful of corporations 
who are said to thrive on chaos. What distinguishes such companies -- the real 
bottom line -- is a single, elusive trait: leadership. Great companies have 
great leaders. And great leaders do the laundry.

RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER 
</P>
<P>
By Train Through China 
</P>
<P>
by Paul Theroux 
</P>
<P>
(Ivy Books: $4.95) 
</P>
<P>
Paul Theroux spent the better part of a year (1986-87) traveling through China 
by train asking people questions about such subjects as the Cultural Revolution 
that even six years previously would have been considered worse than bad 
manners. "My children saw the Red Guards humiliate me," a professor says over 
dinner. Now that travel abroad is permitted, the professor continues, "Can you 
blame them for choosing to stay in Minnesota?" 
</P>
<P>
Theroux captures the sights and sounds along his ride as well as sentiments 
that are more forthcoming today: the spittoons placed in restaurants to 
discourage spitting, the officials who search his luggage specifically for 
pornography ("considered vastly more dangerous than political propaganda"). 
</P>
<P>
While reviewer Jim Mann found Theroux's political analysis "simplistic," he 
called "Riding the Iron Rooster" "an epic account of China. . . . (This) 
talented writer has captured in one sprawling, extraordinary book all the 
craziness, the contradictions, the mixture of hope and despair, the wild swings 
between control and utter chaos."

PNIN 
</P>
<P>
by Vladimir Nabokov 
</P>
<P>
(Vintage International: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
We are introduced to Timofey Pnin, professor of Russian at Waindell College, as 
he rides a train to Cremona, where he will lecture in English -- a language he 
has yet to master -- at the Cremona Women's Club. He is particularly pleased 
that he had puzzled out the schedules and was taking a train that would save 
him 12 minutes. Now he is trying to decide whether to place his lecture notes 
in the coat jacket pocket of the black suit that he will later wear or whether 
his luggage being stolen was a more likely danger than his forgetting his notes 
in his room. "All of which does not alter the fact," Nabokov writes, "that Pnin 
was on the wrong train." 
</P>
<P>
This sort of mishap happens often to Pnin, an earnest Russian emigre who is 
perhaps "too persistently on the lookout for diabolical pitfalls, too painfully 
on the alert lest his erratic surroundings (unpredictable America) inveigle him 
into some bit of preposterous oversight" -- and whose charm and humor are 
frequently revealed unintentionally and at his own expense. "The cat, as Pnin 
would say, cannot be hid in a bag."

The Chicago-area man who pulled his 15-month-old son off a life support system 
at gunpoint and kept police at bay while the child died in his arms April 26 
returned to the hospital for the second time in less than a week. Two days 
after he was taken to Mac Neal Hospital suffering from a violent reaction to 
the illegal drug PCP, Rudolfo Linares, 23, was admitted to the same hospital 
after an overnight arrest for alleged drunk driving. A hospital spokeswoman 
declined to disclose Linares' condition or the reason for his hospitalization. 
Last month, a Cook County grand jury refused to indict Linares on murder 
charges in connection with his brain-damaged baby's death.

* "Some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of string with a worm 
on one end and a damn fool on the other. This is a silly definition, of course, 
for many fishermen use flies instead of worms." 
</P>
<P>
* "Fish is brain food. People who eat fish have large, well-developed brains. 
People with large, well-developed brains don't fish. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the mischievous grin, however, is a serious concern about what could 
lie ahead unless Americans start paying more attention to the world around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five years ago, we didn't have waste products of nuclear plants," Zern 
said. "We didn't have a lot of the poisons that are poisoning the atmosphere. 
We didn't know that spray cans could destroy our ozone layer." 
</P>
<P>
Zern never imagined things would become as bad as they have. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought something would be done about it, measures would be taken," he said. 
"Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
The bearded, hoary-headed author of the "Exit Laughing" column in Field &amp; 
Stream magazine, occasionally mistaken in the past for another avid 
outdoorsman, the late Ernest Hemingway, is doing what he can to increase public 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Zern is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology titled "Hunting 
and Fishing from A to Zern." He also is creator of the more-or-less imaginary 
Madison Avenue Rod, Gun, Bloody Mary and Labrador Retriever Benevolent Assn., 
whose motto is "Keep your powder, your trout flies and your martinis dry." 
</P>
<P>
"It's implicit in everything he does, the respect for the outdoors, the love 
for it," said Maggie Nichols, Field &amp; Stream's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
That zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards program Zern 
founded in 1954 with corporate backing. His aim was, and still is, to give 
conservation-conscious folks "a slap on the back." 
</P>
<P>
His Chevron Conservation Awards Program, believed to be the oldest privately 
supported program of its kind in the country, has recognized 663 individuals 
and 101 organizations over the years. The 1989 finalists were honored May 17 in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Zern helps whittle down the list of up to 150 nominees. Some of 
them, he acknowledges, fit the stereotypical image of the conservationist. 
</P>
<P>
"Little old lady in tennis shoes? They exist and they're charming people, 
usually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His all-time favorite finalist is a 70-year-old Pennsylvania game warden who 
was honored in the late '50s. The man's wife, who nominated her husband for the 
award, thanked Zern profusely after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"This little old lady came up to me and said, 'Mr. Zern, I want to thank you 
for being involved in this and to tell you what a wonderful thing it was for 
me,' " Zern said. "I said, 'Well, I should think it would be wonderful to have 
all these people here to honor your husband.' " 
</P>
<P>
"She looked sort of surprised. She said, 'Oh, no, it isn't that. We've been 
married 52 years and this is the first time we've ever stayed at a hotel.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zern's passion for the outdoors was nurtured by his father, who headed West 
Virginia University's Department of Mines during the early 1900s. The elder 
Zern often took his young son on inspection trips. 
</P>
<P>
"I would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Zern caught his first trout at age 5. The next year, his family moved from West 
Virginia to the Pittsburgh area. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Zern has fished and hunted on five continents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Repeats 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, sometimes by accident and sometimes not, Zern repeats himself in 
his "Exit Laughing" column, which he began in 1958. It never goes unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"I always get three or four letters, and I have the same answer to all of 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I say: 'Dear Mr. Thompson, Thank you for your letter of such and such a date. 
The last time I heard the Philadelphia Orchestra, they played the Brahms First 
and I understand they've done it several times before. Sincerely yours.' " 
</P>
<P>
So just where does he get his ideas? 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had one," he said. "I've got a piece due the day after tomorrow. It 
was a lot easier when I was younger and smart-aleckier than I am now." 
</P>
<P>
He also suffers now from Parkinson's disease, which causes his hands to tremble 
and consequently prevents him from shifting from a manual typewriter to an 
electric typewriter or computer. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Zern is at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., only about half the time. 
The rest of the time he's on the road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Releases His Catch 
</P>
<P>
His favorite sport, and writing topic, is fishing. Like many serious anglers, 
he releases his catch back into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Zern doesn't feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rather glad everybody doesn't like fishing, or the good fishing places 
would be so overpopulated," he said. "So I'd never knowingly write anything 
that would encourage anybody to go fishing. You can always build more bowling 
alleys or tennis courts. You can't build more trout streams." 
</P>
<P>
His sentiments are shared by his program's awardees. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a Juneau, Alaska, couple 
who have developed a school curriculum on marine and wetlands resources, and a 
Milwaukee man who has led a campaign to establish a national park in American 
Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
Ten professional conservationists also received $1,000 and a bronze plaque, 
including a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist from Massachusetts who is 
working to save the threatened Piping Plover, a shore bird. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honors Petaluma Youths 
</P>
<P>
The five group finalists included the United Anglers of Casa Grande High School 
in Petaluma, Calif., which is rehabilitating local waterways so fish can 
migrate upstream. The 30 to 40 students are raising money for a new hatchery to 
replace one that failed to meet earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
Zern said he has no real way of knowing whether the awards program or any of 
his other efforts have had, or will have, a significant effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know how many souls are saved," he said, "no matter how tough 
the sermon."

RICE-FUELED PLANT IS COOKING UP A NEW WAY TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY 
</P>

<P>
The little factory south of town that converts rice wastes to electricity is a 
sweet deal for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
It relieves 21 rice mills of the expensive landfill disposal of rice hulls, and 
spares residents of the Sacramento Valley from the noxious smoke of rice straw 
burning in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. gets power without the financial and 
environmental encumbrances. Electricity users may turn on their toasters 
without visions of oil sheiks or leaking tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Even the makers of concrete, ceramics, glass and computer chips welcome the 
burning rice's ash, which is also used to oxidize and solidify toxic waste 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Colman, president of Oxford Energy Co., owners of the factory, says 
electricity produced by his plant will bring in $15 million to $28 million a 
year at a fuel cost of $3 million to $6.5 million. After paying 33 permanent 
employees and other expenses, he projects operating income at $6 million to $16 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorable Financing 
</P>
<P>
If that isn't sweet enough, Colman says Oxford has little of its own money at 
risk in the $60-million total investment, while keeping majority control. The 
big money comes from bank and similar financing. 
</P>
<P>
The Floyd Myers Marsh Power Plant, the largest of its kind in the world, has 
just gone on line to convert about 200,000 tons of rice hulls and straw a year 
to 29 megawatts of electricity, enough for 35,000 homes. The plant is about 90 
air miles northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
PG&amp;E is required by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 
1987 to buy power from small producers at "avoided cost" -- meaning what it 
would cost to produce the power itself or buy it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The law has given rise to nearly 900 small electricity producers in PG&amp;E 
territory alone, using cogeneration, solid waste, geothermal, solar, hydro and 
wind sources, all with a total capacity of nearly 10 million kilowatts. And 
they are still coming, despite the petering out of governmental incentives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted From Interstate 
</P>
<P>
At first sight from Interstate 5, the plant looms from behind massive 
embankments of rice hulls covered with black plastic and old tires. Start-up 
engineer Thomas Stinson says there is little fire danger. Rice hulls by 
themselves hardly burn. 
</P>
<P>
But when ground into a fine powder and blown through nozzles, the hulls explode 
into an orange inferno at about 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The rice hulls burned are about two-thirds of the total in one of the world's 
richest rice-growing regions. But the straw consumption makes only a small 
dent. Stinson says the straw content of the fuel now being used is only about 
one-eighth, being increased gradually to an expected one-third next year. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of the straw as fuel is being monitored under a state research 
contract. Straw alone has never been used for a power plant. But the potential 
is huge. Stinson said there's enough straw available to justify another 
40-megawatt plant burning straw alone. 
</P>
<P>
Hulls deliver about 6,000 British thermal units per pound, compared to 4,500 
for green wood and 10,000 for coal. 
</P>
<P>
The season for amassing a year's supply of straw is short and irregular, 
depending on weather. Also, some growers still think burning the rice stubble 
is the only way to rid the fields of diseases. They ignore the researchers who 
say bailing and chemical treatment are better. So it is hard to get them to mow 
the stalks close to the ground and bail the straw during harvest. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel arrives on bulky double-trailer trucks and is routed through grinder, 
silos, burners and -- as fly ash -- the bag house. In the control room, before 
three color display screens, operators can call on data from 1,100 sensors 
throughout the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The steam arrives as well water and goes through 23 separate systems before 
blasting into the split-cycle turbine. Most of the systems are to rid it of 
chemicals that would cake up the tubes -- like the bottom of a teapot. No water 
leaves the property, except little wisps of steam connected to control and 
safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
The plant is custom-built. Colman says it should keep humming 20 or 30 years, 
with the final product going out on three wires slung on a single line of wood 
poles, and the checks coming in the mail.

SMOKELESS TOBACCO USE IS CONDEMNED

Researchers hope a study of 1,100 baseball players will keep other boys from 
using smokeless tobacco, which their study strongly links to lesions in the 
mouth and receding gums. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevalence was much greater than we had thought," said Paul Robertson, 
dean of dentistry at the University of British Columbia. The study of major and 
minor league baseball players for the last two years during spring training in 
Arizona will conclude next year. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players were chosen because they are known to be great users of snuff 
and chewing tobacco and are role models for the adolescent males who make up 
smokeless tobacco products' biggest market, Robertson said. Ninety-five percent 
of the players, coaches and managers took part in the voluntary physicals, and 
about 60% were smokeless tobacco users. 
</P>
<P>
The players rinse their mouths to remove all traces of smokeless tobacco before 
they are checked, "so the data is unbiased, which makes the results even more 
frightening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growths and Lesions 
</P>
<P>
About half of the current users had lesions or growths in their mouths at the 
site where they used smokeless tobacco, Robertson said. The gum tissue also had 
receded in users. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of receding gums was more than twice what we found in the baseball 
players who did not use smokeless tobacco. It's site-specific. Where you hold 
the smokeless tobacco is where you have the damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the gum recession is permanent, but researchers still don't know 
what happens to the lesions over time. 
</P>
<P>
"If you quit, the lesion goes away," he said, displaying slides of the growths 
found in players' mouths. "What we don't know is if you don't quit, how many of 
them go on to become cancer of the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that some do; we don't know how many." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said researchers believe they may be seeing fewer problems among the 
baseball players than they would in the general population because of the 
athletes' greater fitness and health awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Klose of the Smokeless Tobacco Council in Washington said about 10 
million to 12 million Americans use smokeless tobacco. "The council's position 
is that smokeless tobacco has never, ever been scientifically proven to be the 
cause of any human disease," Klose said. 
</P>
<P>
About 67,000 Canadian males age 15 or older use chewing tobacco and 38,400 use 
snuff, according to the Health and Welfare Department. The National Cancer 
Institute estimates that 3 million Americans younger than 21 use smokeless 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Snuff 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the players in the study use snuff, 20% use chewing tobacco 
and 10% use both, said Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
The research project, which includes physicians, dentists, epidemiologists and 
psychologists, originated at UC San Francisco, where Dean John Greene is "an 
avid baseball fan." Robertson, a Houston native and also a baseball fan, came 
to Vancouver from San Francisco about a year ago. Both universities are now 
cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
"As smoking has become more and more socially unacceptable, there has been a 
tremendous increase in the last decade in the use of smokeless tobacco," he 
said, adding that the potential for addiction is the same as cigarettes. "It 
would appear that quitting smokeless tobacco is as difficult as quitting 
smoking, but we don't know that and that's one of the things we have to ask."

CHURCH-LINKED GROUPS CHALLENGING ABORTION LAWS IN WESTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BETH SHERIDAN, Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>

ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the U.S. Supreme Court considers a new ruling on legal abortion, the issue 
is flaring in Western Europe, with church-backed groups fighting to limit laws 
that have made the procedure widely available. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has touched off street demonstrations in Italy, threatened the 
stability of Belgium's government and prompted a debate in West Germany, where 
authorities have cracked down on violators of the abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
But in many other parts of the world, it is barely an issue, either because of 
a consensus that it is wrong or a broad acceptance of abortion as a form of 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Level in China 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Bloc and China, for example, abortion has reached high levels -- 
one for every two live births in China -- but it is widely accepted. Even in 
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Poland, the practice is widespread, although 
there is a drive under way to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church has been the principal force behind worldwide 
campaigning against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"The protection and defense of the human person -- every person and the whole 
person, especially those who are vulnerable and most helpless -- this is a task 
which the Catholic Church, in the name of Christ, cannot and will not forsake," 
Pope John Paul II said last month, reaffirming the church's total ban on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, church-backed groups have played a key role in a vocal 
campaign against the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. The 
Supreme Court in Washington is considering a case that could weaken Roe; it is 
expected to rule this month. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion became legal in many Western European countries in the 1970s and early 
1980s. But, as in the United States, legalization has not tempered the debate. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, hundreds of thousands of protesters thronged the streets of Rome this 
spring in the biggest demonstrations for and against abortion since 1981, when 
Italians voted in a referendum to uphold abortion on demand in the first three 
months of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Carlo Donat Cattin, a member of the Christian Democrat Party, 
has joined religious groups and conservatives in calling for limits on the law. 
Pro-choice demonstrators have countered, protesting "loopholes" in the law they 
blame for a growing number of "back alley" abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, a 16-year battle to legalize abortion realized its first victory in 
May when two Senate committees voted to allow abortion in cases of 
psychological or economic distress. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure is fiercely opposed by Belgium's dominant Christian Democrats, 
a Catholic-inspired party. The issue could bring down the coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, as in the United States, restrictions on abortion have not 
prevented women from getting them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flocking to Netherlands 
</P>
<P>
For example, many Belgians go next door to the Netherlands, where abortion laws 
are more liberal. Dutch hospitals performed 36,455 abortions in 1986, 21,655 of 
them for foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
And in Britain, doctors performed 3,673 abortions in 1987 for women from 
Ireland, where the operation is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue returned to the front pages in West Germany in May, when a 
Bavarian court convicted Dr. Horst Theissen of performing abortions without 
proof that the women had been counseled by at least two doctors, as required by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Bavaria, which is 70% Catholic, also indicted 156 of Theissen's 
patients on charges of getting abortions without the required counseling. Most 
were fined. The cases prompted rallies by pro-choice groups and criticism from 
the country's main opposition party, the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a common means of birth control in the Soviet Bloc. Even in Poland, 
where more than 90% of the population considers itself Catholic, an estimated 
one in two pregnancies is terminated by abortion -- one of the highest rates in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect of Housing Shortage 
</P>
<P>
A severe housing shortage and erratic supplies of contraceptives contribute to 
the rate. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Parliament is considering legislation backed by the Catholic Church to 
make abortion a crime. Both pro- and anti-abortion groups have held 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, women average six to nine abortions each during their 
child-bearing years, according to Western estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The country's top-ranking woman, candidate Politburo member Alexandra P. 
Biryukova, has complained about the number and blamed it on a shortage of 
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion was legalized in many East Bloc countries in the 1950s, but 
contraceptives were not generally available until the 1970s, said Jeremy 
Hamand, publications director of the London-based International Planned 
Parenthood Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"When they did come in, there was a whole generation of women who had 
controlled their fertility by abortion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Asian countries outlaw abortion, but it is widely practiced in Japan 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Dentist Appointment' 
</P>
<P>
"It was like making an appointment at the dentist," said one college student 
who recently had an abortion in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Japan bans the birth control pill because of possible side effects. The 
country's main religions, Buddhism and Shintoism, do not condemn abortion, and 
it carries no social stigma. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry in Tokyo says Japan had 17.8 registered abortions for every 
1,000 women aged 15 to 49 in 1985. However, many abortions go unreported, 
doctors say. Japan's rate might exceed that of the United States, which had 24 
terminated pregnancies for every 1,000 females of child-bearing age that year. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a major form of population control in China, where more than 10 
million abortions are performed each year. Although there is some individual 
resistance to government pressures to abort unplanned babies, there are no 
anti-abortion groups, and the main criticism of the rate has come from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Mortality Rate 
</P>
<P>
In predominantly Catholic Latin America, abortion is widely illegal except for 
cases in which the woman's life is in danger or she is a victim of rape. There 
has been little or no movement to expand those conditions.

Iran said Saturday that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's health is

A statement broadcast on Tehran Radio described the change in the 87-year-old 
leader's condition as a "complication" but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
It said doctors were attempting to carry out the necessary treatment and that 
it hoped and expected that the prayers of the people would be answered. 
</P>
<P>
"We call on all the pious nation to continue their sincere prayers," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son Calls for Prayers 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's office, controlled by his son and chief aide, Ahmed, also appealed 
to the revolutionary leader's Shiite Muslim followers to keep praying for his 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Television followed its regular evening newscast with film of Khomeini 
in his hospital bed awaiting surgery, interspersed with shots of Iranians at 
mass prayer sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The same sequence has been shown nightly since the revolutionary patriarch 
underwent surgery at a Tehran hospital May 23 to control intestinal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication that Iran's official media were preparing the 
nation for an announcement of his death. 
</P>
<P>
But the report that Khomeini's condition had worsened made a sharp contrast 
with earlier medical bulletins stressing that he was making a normal recovery 
and taking solid food. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tehran television said that Khomeini got out of bed to visit with 
friends and relatives outside the hospital building. It showed film of the 
white-bearded leader sitting in the open air, performing his prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, the television said a "slight cardiac complication" had 
arisen May 27 but that it was relieved the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's main opposition group, the Moujahedeen, said last week that Khomeini 
suffered a heart attack May 27. The statement by the Iraq-based group said the 
heart attack came five days after he underwent surgery on the duodenum, a part 
of the small intestine close to the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
But the Moujahedeen's claim could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart attack in 1986. 
Since then, he has rarely been seen outside his home in the north Tehran suburb 
of Jamaran. 
</P>
<P>
But his hospitalization has heightened already intense speculation about who 
will succeed him as leader of the theocratic state. 
</P>
<P>
Political turmoil has gripped the country since Khomeini launched a radical 
resurgence in February with his death decree against British author Salman 
Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
A purge of so-called moderates who apparently favored rebuilding ties with the 
West followed as the 10-year-old Islamic regime withdrew into its isolationist 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ousted Montazeri 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini in March ousted his designated successor, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali 
Montazeri, who had openly criticized the regime's shortcomings, then appointed 
a 20-member committee to review the succession. 
</P>
<P>
But in the absence of a single personality who could match the patriarch's 
political and revolutionary authority, there is widespread speculation that 
Iran may be ruled by a collective leadership in the post-Khomeini era. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini swept to power in 1979 in a mass movement of Islamic enthusiasm and 
rejection of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's pro-Western monarchy and directed the 
nation through an eight-year war with Iraq.

33 YEARS AFTER LEGALIZING ABORTION, POLAND IS PRESSURED TO RECONSIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abortion has been legal under Communist rule for 33 years in predominantly 
Roman Catholic Poland, but now with conditions relaxed and open elections ahead 
there's talk of outlawing it. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of Solidarity union activists preparing for the elections, 
nominees were challenged on their positions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In a television special, a member of Parliament suggests the possibility of a 
nationwide referendum on the law that has made abortions legal since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal submitted by 78 of the 460 members of the Sejm, as Parliament is 
called, would ban abortions altogether. It provides for three-year jail terms 
for women who have them and the doctors who perform them. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Church loyalists within the government alliance support the ban, but 
it is opposed by the Communist Party leadership. There are strongly religious 
strains against abortion within the Solidarity-led opposition movement, while 
others in the movement defend abortion as a personal matter. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion was legalized in Poland as part of a Communist economic and social 
policy unfettered by religious considerations or public debate. 
</P>
<P>
Poland now has one of the world's highest rates of abortion, with some 
estimates suggesting that more than half of all pregnancies are terminated. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent statistics available record 605,500 births and 122,500 
abortions in 1987, but the abortion figure does not count the vast numbers 
performed in privatedoctors' offices. One demographic study puts the total at 
600,000 abortions a year and church attacks on abortion have estimated 800,000 
to 1 million procedures annually. 
</P>
<P>
Since the abortion bill was submitted in the Sejm on Feb. 28, the official 
press and television have carried lengthy discourses on abortion and hundreds 
of abortion foes attended a Catholic Mass and protest march, while opponents of 
the ban circulated petitions. 
</P>
<P>
The recent negotiations between Solidarity and the government only touched on 
abortion, partly because of the divided opinion within the union. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, who leads the Solidarity side on health issues, considers 
the proposed ban "very repressive" but says that within the movement, "people 
who are very strongly with the Catholic Church are not so strongly against (the 
ban) as I am." 
</P>
<P>
Two Solidarity activists who are election candidates awkwardly played both 
sides of the issue during a recent meeting -- opposing the proposed law because 
of its stiff jail terms while agreeing that abortion is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The church is organizing anti-abortion drives in parishes and outlining its 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"The law legalizing abortion is the work of (a) totalitarian ruling of the 
Stalinist type, which has common ideological roots with Nazism," said the Rev. 
Jerzy Bajda, an anti-abortion leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the (1956) law from today's perspective, one should say its aim 
could only be the moral and biological destruction of the Polish nation." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Dobraczynski, a Catholic Sejm deputy and head of the national patriotic 
group PRON, voted against the abortion law in 1956 while one of the five 
non-party Sejm members. He is a leader in the fight now. 
</P>
<P>
"From the moment the new law was in force . . . it quickly became more 
dangerous than it looked in theory," he said. "The law allowed abortion but set 
many social and economic conditions. Soon, it gave doctors the freedom to do it 
without any justifications." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ban say that forbidding abortion after 33 years would drive it 
underground, making it less safe and more costly. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposed law is dangerous because we may return to the secrecy of 
abortions," said Jan Mlynarski, a Warsaw hospital physician. "Some doctors will 
be making fortunes on it, but women will only suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Mlynarski added that most women seeking abortions give him economic reasons: 
"Women are afraid of what might happen with their second or third child." 
</P>
<P>
The impact of unplanned pregnancy takes on special poignancy because couples 
often are hard pressed to support children with whom they may be sharing two 
tiny rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The wait for an apartment is a decade or more for young couples. The housing 
crisis and poor economic conditions have a deep impact on decisions to have 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Married women in Poland work out of economic necessity, if not professional 
reward, but child and essential family care remains their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Banning abortion would "accelerate the pauperization of millions of women who 
are already the most burdened part of our society," a group of intellectuals 
wrote in a women's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The government-backed Polish Women's League has also spoken out. 
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the assumption included in the draft (law) that the woman is to bear 
all legal responsibility for abortion, which contradicts the legal acts that 
provide for women's and men's equality in rights and duties," league secretary 
Elzbieta Dehnel-Luszczynska told the state news agency PAP.

IRAQ BUILDS A $6-BILLION DREAM IN BASRA AFTER DEVASTATION OF LONG WAR WITH IRAN 
</P>

BASRA, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government of Iraq is spending $6 billion to rebuild this city at almost 
head-spinning speed, turning a town left virtually demolished by the war with 
Iran into "Iraq's most beautiful and elegant city." 
</P>
<P>
Workers have built bridges, replaced buildings, fixed roads, added new water 
and electricity systems and have even begun replacing palm trees decapitated by 
artillery fire. 
</P>
<P>
Officials plan to erect nearly 100 statues of war heroes, with their fingers 
pointing forbiddingly in the direction of neighboring Iran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Brave Men' Praised 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing cannot be compared with the sacrifices of thousands of brave 
men who lost their lives in defending Basra," said engineer Nawaf Abdullah as 
he supervised a street repaving in downtown Basra. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in February imposed a three-month deadline for 
completing reconstruction of this strategic city overlooking the Shatt al Arab 
waterway, Iraq's main outlet to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline was to have expired May 12, but Gov. Anwar Sayeed Hadithi said the 
renovation has been extended to June 12 to cover more of the city and encompass 
new projects. 
</P>
<P>
At least 90% of the buildings in Basra were destroyed or damaged in fierce 
Iranian artillery barrages during the eight-year war. Iranian troops got within 
six miles of the city last year before being driven back, and Iraqis consider 
the city a symbol of their defense. 
</P>
<P>
After the August cease-fire, the Iraqi government announced it would rebuild 
Basra. So far, it claims to have committed $6 billion to the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 New Bridges 
</P>
<P>
Hadithi said six small rivers in Basra have been cleared of debris, their banks 
resurfaced and 40 bridges constructed. 
</P>
<P>
A new electricity grid and new pipe network for drinking water have been 
installed. Iraqi authorities have said they will build a new drinking-water 
processing plant in Basra that will tap water from the Euphrates River far 
north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Residents consider the current water from the Shatt al Arab too brackish. 
</P>
<P>
Hadithi said the government offered unlimited money to finance the development 
so that Basra can be "Iraq's most beautiful and elegant city." 
</P>
<P>
But the city still bears scars from the shelling, including shrapnel holes in 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Returns 
</P>
<P>
Hadithi said the city, Iraq's second largest after Baghdad, is back to its 
prewar population of 1.5 million. About half the population is believed to have 
fled during the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
The government has encouraged people to return by offering plots of land, cash 
gifts and loans or grants of up to $32,000 to build new homes. 
</P>
<P>
The government also is offering similar incentives to get people with no Basra 
roots to move into the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the projects is the construction of 96 statues of senior Iraqi officers 
killed while defending the city. The statues will be erected on the corniche of 
the Shatt al Arab with their arms pointing east, toward Iran, "warning against 
the dangers which have always come from Iran," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
The government did not use independent contractors for the reconstruction 
drive. Instead, it relied on its own personnel and machinery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'City of Cities' 
</P>
<P>
At least 100,000 workers and 40,000 machines from different parts of the 
country were dispatched to take part in the project, called "the national drive 
for the reconstruction of the city of cities." 
</P>
<P>
Basra has as much strategic as symbolic importance to Iraq. Iran insists that a 
1975 treaty placing the countries' southern border in the middle of the Shatt 
al Arab is still valid. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq says that the treaty is invalid and that the border is on Iran's eastern 
bank.

NEPAL'S FORMER CHILD GODDESS, NOW 20, CATCHES UP WITH LIFE AFTER RETIRING AT 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KATMANDU, Nepal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunina Shakya is catching up on the schooling she missed when she was a 
goddess. 
</P>
<P>
Once she lived in an elaborately carved wooden house in Nepal's royal palace 
compound. Now the shy and slender 20-year-old lives with her family in a 
fourth-floor tenement flat in Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>
Retired by tradition at age 13, Sunina -- who had to skip school when she was a 
child goddess -- is finishing high school and wants to be a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
She first began to understand she was special at about the age of 6, Sunina 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
She had been chosen over several other candidates at the age of 4 as the new 
"Kumari Bahal," virgin goddess and spiritual consort to the king of Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
According to legend, the kings once consulted with the divine Kumari on matters 
of state, but one day about 200 years ago a king lusted after her during a game 
of dice. 
</P>
<P>
The affronted goddess refused to be seen again in this world, but promised to 
return reincarnated as the daughter of someone in the Sakya clan of goldsmiths 
and silversmiths. 
</P>
<P>
Sunina had met the qualifications for a reincarnated Kumari. Her horoscope was 
in harmony with that of Nepal's King Birendra, she came from the Sakya clan, 
had perfect teeth and had never shed blood nor broken any bones. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she passed the last test. 
</P>
<P>
The child candidates were all put in a darkened room and subjected to fearsome 
noises. Sunina said she does not remember much about the ordeal but she 
apparently was the calmest child -- which meant she was the reincarnated 
goddess. 
</P>
<P>
She was never allowed to leave her rooms on the third floor of the Kumari 
house, which has magnificent carvings of gods on the walls and painted lion 
statues at the entrance, except on certain festivals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy in the Kumari house," she said. "I don't know why. Maybe 
because it was the gods' place." 
</P>
<P>
Young men carried her in a sumptuously decorated palanquin through the streets 
of Katmandu on festival days. Children were allowed to come up and play with 
her. Men came to worship, sometimes leaving gifts or money. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to do anything. Just sit, and people used to pray," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On festival days she wore a red gown draped with heavy jewelry and a gold and 
silver inlaid headdress shaped like a peacock. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal, though officially Hindu, has been strongly influenced by Buddhism and 
its esoteric offshoot, Tantrism, which emphasizes eroticism and direct 
experience over meditation. Religion seems to infuse all aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
The king, regarded by some Nepalese Hindus as an incarnation of the Hindu god 
Vishnu, pays homage to the living goddess during Indrajatra, one of Nepal's 
most spectacular religious festivals. 
</P>
<P>
Sunina recalls nervously anointing him on that day with a mixture of powders, 
flower petals and rice that Nepal's Hindus rub onto the forehead to symbolize 
the divine presence. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 13 and the onset of puberty, Sunina retired as child goddess, as 
her predecessors had since the mid-18th Century, when the tradition of 
reincarnated virgin goddesses began. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt free . . . and confused," Sunina said. "People were walking so fast and 
it was so crowded. It was very difficult at first." 
</P>
<P>
She got a pet dog. The living goddess is not allowed near animals and Sunina 
said she used to yearn for a pet when she saw children playing with cats or 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I go back and visit the new Kumari and at the festivals usually all 
the old Kumaris have a get-together with the new one," Sunina said. 
</P>
<P>
Kumaris by tradition were supposed to remain virgins for the rest of their 
lives, though in modern times many of them married. "I don't want to get 
married," Sunina said. "Maybe one day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"People believe it is bad luck to marry a former Kumari," the interpreter 
explained in a whispered aside. "The husbands often die a year or two after the 
marriage."

As troops smashed the pro-democracy forces in Beijing with brute force, Chinese 
students and Chinese-Americans gathered on the steps of the Chinese Consulate 
in Los Angeles on Saturday calling solemnly -- and in some cases tearfully -- 
for an end to the bloodshed in China. 
</P>
<P>
The group of more than 100 showed their support for pro-democracy forces in 
China with speeches, chants, tears, songs and a call on President Bush, 
Congress and the United Nations to condemn the massacre and pressure the 
Chinese leaders to stop the killing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrible Incident' 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most horrible incident of government brutality in history," said a 
declaration distributed by the students. "In addition to being sad and angry, 
we should do our best to support our suffering Chinese countrymen." 
</P>
<P>
They sat on the steps and sidewalk and listened quietly as a recording of a 
phone call from Beijing to UCLA was played. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Yin, 25, a former Beijing University student now studying psychology at 
Cal State Los Angeles, covered his eyes as the voice on the phone reported that 
"blood is flowing in Tian An Men (Square)" and heard the names of some of those 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Yin said he knew one of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco's Chinese community -- the largest concentration of 
Chinese-Americans in the United States -- leaders called on people of Chinese 
ancestry from throughout the world to join in opposition to the Beijing 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God! Oh my God!" cried Choi Soon, 32, listening to radio reports from 
China as she sat across from City Hall. "How can the government kill? Those are 
my brothers and sisters in the square, and they are being murdered." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Mayor Edward I. Koch led a small rally in Battery Park in Lower 
Manhattan to protest the military action in China. With the Statue of Liberty 
in the background, Koch called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
He cried: "Shame! Shame!" and a small crowd picked up the chant. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the demonstrators -- organized by a group of Hong Kong students 
and professionals -- wore blue ribbons, signifying democracy, peace and 
freedom, as they gathered at the Chinese Consulate in the Mid-Wilshire district 
for the two-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Mood 
</P>
<P>
Such groups have been gathering for the past several weeks, but the mood 
Saturday was quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Someone had taped a banner on the glass doors, reading "United Nations. U.S. 
Congress. President Bush. Take Your Stand. Stop Bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
The rally was led by Richard Leung, 27, a computer science student studying for 
his master's degree at UCLA, and Jacqueline Cheng, also a Hong Kong student. 
They took turns calling for action to stop the killing in China and led chants 
in Chinese and English. 
</P>
<P>
"No more bloodshed! Long live freedom! Long live democracy! Victory belongs to 
the people!" they cried, and the others joined in. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the crowd also spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Yao Xiaotian, an engineering student wearing a USC sweatshirt, said the news 
had upset him. "We cannot keep silent," he said. "It is time for us to stand 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rhetoric seemed to be offered with more concern than fury, but Yin 
declared that he was angry because the tens of thousands of protesters in Tian 
An Men Square are "our brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Digging Their Own Grave' 
</P>
<P>
"This government is capable of anything," Yin said. "They're only digging their 
own grave. Someday we'll achieve victory." 
</P>
<P>
A sign scrawled on a piece of cardboard hanging from a light fixture declared, 
"Blood will be paid by blood." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the rally, members of the crowd joined hands, raised their arms 
and sang "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Then, they cried, "No more bloodshed! Long live democracy! Long live freedom!"

A reporter's telephone call interrupted Otis Butler's breakfast. He had been 
eating a tomato out of his freezer. 
</P>
<P>
He'd grown the tomato himself, in a garden carved out of a vacant lot -- in the 
Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
Butler is a retired baker and president of the Union Prospect Area Block Assn. 
But when he talks tomatoes, he sounds like a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Could Have Won a Prize' 
</P>
<P>
"We need rain," he says. "We had six weeks of hot weather last summer, hot and 
dry. It knocked our tomatoes down. We didn't even enter the 58th Street 
horticulture fair, but when I saw tomatoes that won prizes, I said, what the 
heck, our tomatoes are as good as these. We could have won a prize. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody had real good tomatoes last summer."

An unlikely mid-morning conversation, an unlikely farmer, talking about crops 
grown from seeds that came from an unlikely place: The seed-jammed office of 
the America the Beautiful Fund in an aging building a few blocks from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
It may be the only office in Washington in which the top drawer of a green file 
cabinet is labeled "Prairie Grass," the middle drawer is labeled "Bulk Flowers 
and Muskmelon" and the bottom drawer is labeled "Corn, Beans, Pea Packets." 
</P>
<P>
From these shoe box quarters, and operating on a shoestring, the fund 
distributes donated vegetable, herb and flower seeds and bulbs to local 
projects across America. 
</P>
<P>
America the Beautiful Fund turns out to be four part-time workers, a handful of 
volunteers and a full-time staff of three. Wildlife biologist Paul Bruce 
Dowling, the founder, is executive director. Former actress Nanine Bilski is 
national projects director and anthropologist Nat Thomas spends much of his 
time packing envelopes with seed packets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Operation Green Plant' 
</P>
<P>
They are Johnny Appleseeds with a computer -- and a far broader variety of 
seeds to give away. They figure their "Operation Green Plant" reaches into one 
county in 10, maybe even one in three. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is simplicity itself: Persuade a dozen of the nation's seed companies 
to donate -- rather than destroy -- "last year's" seeds, on the promise they 
will go only to people who would not be in a position to buy them at the corner 
hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
Persuade APA Transport and other trucking companies to bring in the seeds at no 
charge. Persuade local poverty agencies, 4-H chapters, church groups, 
neighborhood associations, refugee centers, drug rehabilitation centers, county 
health departments, soup kitchens, nursing homes -- even hospices for AIDS 
patients -- to start gardening projects. Charge them only the cost of shipping 
the seeds -- 50 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
For $12 in shipping fees, a group can get enough seeds to sow two acres of 
tomatoes and one acre each of corn, lettuce, cucumbers, green peppers and 
squash. 
</P>
<P>
The idea started in 1980 with 60 beautification projects. It took off when the 
new environmental ethic caught up with the nation's dawning awareness that 
there was hunger on the street corners, in the small towns and even on the 
farms of this prosperous, fertile and sometimes overfed land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50,000 Pounds of Seeds 
</P>
<P>
Last season, 15,000 groups asked for, received and distributed 500,000 packets 
of seeds and 50,000 pounds in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
That's enough, Dowling estimates, to produce "over 70 million pounds of fresh, 
nutritious food, grown by and for hungry people at the cost of a penny a 
pound." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an idea so simple and so basic that it works," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the food grown last year, by Dowling's seat-of-the-pants estimate, 
is $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
This year, those figures will double, Dowling and Bilski confidently predict. 
They should know. Many of the seeds for this spring's planting already have 
been shipped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inner-City Projects 
</P>
<P>
Most seeds go to the rural poor, but many go to inner-city projects such as 
Otis Butler's in the Bronx, one of hundreds of gardens in metropolitan New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Butler says 18 adults and a handful of kids raised enough food to feed 
themselves and 30 other families. So successful has the project been that 
participants had to buy freezers so they could store what couldn't be eaten 
fresh -- including, of course, Otis' breakfast tomato. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little work attached to it," he says, "but when you look at what 
you've grown -- oh, God!" 
</P>
<P>
Says Bilski: "Do you know that Chinese proverb: 'Give a man a fish and he'll 
eat for a day; teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime'?" 
</P>
<P>
Dowling: "Money's not appreciated the way seeds are. Seeds are a chance to do 
something for oneself -- a chance to put God's own magic to work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeds to AIDS Patients 
</P>
<P>
Bilski: "We got word about what happened when we sent paperwhite narcissus 
bulbs to a project for AIDS patients. The doctors told us about one man who had 
been antisocial all his life. Then he grew some paperwhites and brought them 
around to the bedsides of other patients. It gave them joy and it gave him joy. 
A doctor said maybe this was the one positive thing he was waiting to do before 
he died." 
</P>
<P>
Dowling: "If we could figure out how to put growing plants into the drug 
culture, maybe they could be part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Green Plant" operates with a minimum of that Washington perennial: 
red tape. A one-page flyer, headlined "FREE SEEDS" is sent to all who ask and 
all who America the Beautiful thinks might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
"We are offering between 50 and 750 packets for the projects of local groups on 
the basis of availability and relative need, for volunteer work in growing food 
for the needy, growing plants for charitable plant sales; to beautify 
neighborhoods, grow plants for the elderly, the handicapped and the confined, 
start new educational programs to show that growing plants can give people and 
communities new hope as they help to beautify and nourish America," the flyer 
reads. 
</P>
<P>
America the Beautiful operates on a budget of about $250,000 in contributions 
from people and foundations. If Dowling's calculations are correct, it means 
every donated dollar yields 280 pounds of food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals to Foundations 
</P>
<P>
Enough money has been hard to come by, Dowling says. He sent out appeals to 
foundations this winter for the $150,000 that would be required to enlarge the 
operation's bulk seed warehouse in Lorton, Va., to allow a vast expansion of 
the program, but got no takers. 
</P>
<P>
Foundations are hard to convert, he says. They're in the habit of supporting 
more sophisticated proposals than one that merely sends seeds to people. 
</P>
<P>
Dowling says 50 packets of seeds will be sent -- no questions asked -- to any 
organization that promises to distribute them. Projects seeking more are asked 
first to tell how the seeds are to be used. 
</P>
<P>
"If they write a letter," he says, "that's good enough for us." 
</P>
<P>
What goes back is a seed grant -- in the fullest sense of that term. 
</P>
<P>

self-addressed stamped envelope to America the Beautiful Fund, Box MFAP, 219 
Shoreham Building, Washington, D.C. 20005.

Marveling at Nordic scenery of stark and fragile beauty, Pope John Paul II 
called Saturday for greater commitment by human beings to the protection of 
their environment. 
</P>
<P>
Icy Norwegian fiords seen fitfully from a plane window, snow-capped peaks 
nestled in brooding clouds and Icelandic lava fields dressed green for spring 
marked the Pope's passage Saturday on the third day of his Nordic visit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, about a thousand Norwegians, more curious than devout, braved a gray, 
foreboding morning to attend an outdoor Mass in the market square of the 
fishing port of Tromso on Europe's northern tip. 
</P>
<P>
Four young Protestant fundamentalists protesting the papal visit to Norway were 
hustled away by police as John Paul addressed a congregation that Vatican 
specialists considered the smallest of the Pope's 42 foreign trips. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul delivered a wind-tossed homily based on the Book of Genesis -- man 
being made in the "image and likeness" of God. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, Genesis also speaks of another fundamental gift: the Earth, 
which is given to man so that he may use its riches in a creative way," the 
Pope said in turning to environmental concerns that are one of the main themes 
of his latest pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
"How well does man use these fundamental gifts?" the Pope asked. "Does man make 
good use of his dominion over the Earth? Is he a conscientious protector of 
creatures or brutal exploiter? By misusing the natural environment, does he not 
threaten his own future on this planet?" 
</P>
<P>
Praising Iceland's "magnificent landscapes and mountain peaks," John Paul 
returned to his theme in a greeting to Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson 
on the cold tarmac of the airport here. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, in Iceland and throughout the world, men and woman of good will are 
increasingly aware of the need for enduring peace among nations and peoples," 
John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
"In their concern for the future of the world in which their children will 
live, they have come to recognize the threat of a materialism that would 
sacrifice the environment itself to the pursuit of a sterile material 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Iceland, a volcanic island of 252,000 that has historically lived from the 
surrounding sea, is home today to a prosperous population that has the longest 
life expectancy on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of all the know-how we have acquired, we are still destroying our 
environment. We must set aside our differences and join hands in the effort to 
reverse such development," Hermannsson told John Paul.

<TEXT>
<P>
When George Bush left for Europe a little more than a week ago, he was besieged 
by critics for failing to meet the challenges of Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. At home, Democrats derided him as ineffective. Abroad, the allies 
fretted over a vacuum in NATO leadership. Even the usually civil British 
Broadcasting Corp. referred to Bush as "President Dither." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the President returned in triumph after a virtuoso performance at 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit. He was "President Dither" no 
more. Yet his success in Europe, far from offering a respite from the world's 
demands for bold diplomacy, actually sets up a new series of challenges for the 
United States and the West. 
</P>
<P>
And these new challenges go beyond the welter of technical and other problems 
associated with the details of his dramatic proposals on arms control. 
</P>
<P>
"The President lucked out, in a way," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State 
Department counselor. "He ended the period of what looked like a directionless 
policy just in time. . . . But there are still a lot of difficult issues to 
solve. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fundamental questions (of Western strategy) that are forcing their 
way to the top of the agenda," Sonnenfeldt said. 
</P>
<P>
After months of insisting that the United States should not get onto the 
public-relations playing field with Gorbachev, the President turned his critics 
into cheerleaders by doing just that, with a carefully designed arms control 
proposal that won worldwide praise. 
</P>
<P>
But that may have been the easy part. The challenge now, officials and experts 
say, is to keep pressure on the Soviet Union to respond to the West's agenda 
while satisfying rising public expectations for progress in East-West 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet those soaring expectations would be to risk a fall as meteoric 
as this week's rise, these analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
At the NATO summit in Brussels, Bush offered a new Western proposal for 
negotiations to shrink the armies that face each other across Europe's Iron 
Curtain, including a cut of 30,000 U.S. troops on the continent. And, he said, 
he hoped to see results within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
That initiative enabled the Atlantic Alliance to reach a compromise on 
short-range nuclear missiles, which West Germany wants to reduce over 
resistance from Britain and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The President's success on both issues reinvigorated the alliance, which has 
been searching for a new definition of its purpose in the face of Gorbachev's 
bold acts to reduce the apparent Soviet threat to the West. 
</P>
<P>
But what it left for Bush, now the acknowledged leader of the West, to deal 
with were: 
</P>
<P>
* The deadline pressures, perhaps even greater on Washington than on Moscow, to 
meet Bush's call for a pact on conventional forces in the astonishingly short 
time of 12 months. The timetable was designed to put pressure on Gorbachev to 
bring his forces down to Western levels -- but the deadline appears almost 
impossible to make. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should discount the complexity of the negotiations to follow," Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney warned. And the gambit could backfire: "Usually, when you 
put any kind of implicit deadlines on a negotiation, you end up putting more 
pressure on the United States than you do on the adversary," said Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
* Political pressures likely to be generated in the United States and in 
several NATO countries to cut back their own forces whether or not the Soviet 
Union does likewise. Bush's proposal to withdraw 30,000 U.S. troops from 
Europe, while a relatively modest move, may set off a rush of sentiment for 
cutbacks by individual NATO countries that could outpace the negotiations with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the summit, this is base camp one," said Rep. Patricia Schroeder 
(D-Colo.), a leading proponent of troop withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a problem in Europe," added Sonnenfeldt. "The allies have 
budget pressures and domestic pressures too." 
</P>
<P>
* An inevitable resurgence of European sentiment for immediate negotiations 
with the Soviets on the divisive issue of short-range nuclear missiles. By the 
end of this week, NATO's compromise over short-range nuclear weapons was 
already a bit frayed at the edges. West Germany's opposition parties renewed 
their demands for immediate negotiations to reduce short-range missiles (which 
NATO rejected, opting instead to endorse negotiations only after the Soviet 
Bloc shrinks its conventional forces). 
</P>
<P>
And Bonn's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has already suggested that 
the alliance's commitment to maintain some short-range nuclear missiles -- a 
critical point to the Bush Administration -- might not last forever. 
</P>
<P>
* Some long-term questions of NATO strategy which, not surprisingly, were left 
up in the air by the summit. As pressure continues to reduce both conventional 
forces and battlefield nuclear weapons, how will the alliance continue to meet 
its most basic mission, to deter the threat of attack from the East? 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of German uneasiness about the existing strategy, especially 
its reliance on short-range nuclear forces, and the perception of a declining 
threat means that this debate is certainly going to continue," Sonnenfeldt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
* The Administration's continuing "Gorbachev problem," which was momentarily 
ameliorated, but not eliminated, by Bush's tour de force at the NATO summit. 
The Soviet leader is scheduled to visit West Germany beginning June 12, and 
officials expect him at the very least to renew his call for the elimination of 
battlefield nuclear weapons -- if he does not go farther and pull off yet 
another public relations coup of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that possibility, the Bush Administration hopes to keep the 
pressure on Gorbachev by maintaining the public focus on issues on which the 
West holds the advantage: conventional armed forces, where NATO's new proposal 
challenges the Soviet Union to make much deeper cuts than the Kremlin has 
offered; the political and economic success of the West, as compared to the 
Soviet Bloc, and new opportunities for interaction with Eastern Europe, where 
Moscow has allowed more autonomy and pluralism than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
NATO has always been a political alliance as well as a military pact, but the 
organization crossed a watershed at the summit: For the first time, it placed 
greater emphasis on its political potential. The final communique, for example, 
said security is enhanced not only with military defenses but also with 
political negotiations toward new arms control agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The new NATO agenda also accepted Bush's new policy toward the Soviet Union, 
called "beyond containment," as well as its implicit call for a "rollback" of 
communism in Eastern Europe. "We're very careful not to use that phrase, 
'rollback,' " said a senior U.S. official, recalling that the Cold War policy 
of pushing the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe was never successfully put 
into effect. A senior NATO official added: "We prefer to think of East Europe 
being sucked back into Western Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Eastern Europe is likely to become the next major battleground 
for the Administration's diplomacy, beginning with Bush's scheduled visits to 
Poland and Hungary next month. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are working on a set of options for the President to 
announce as part of a new U.S. economic and political opening to those 
countries, the most liberal in the area; the NATO communique mentioned such 
moves as student exchanges, technology assistance and even management training 
for budding capitalists. The measures also would be offered to other countries 
in the Soviet Bloc, as "incentives" for them to institute reforms too, one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the Administration's new ideas about Eastern Europe have already 
drawn some complaints from West Germany, the same country that worried most 
about Bush's lack of imagination on arms control. A senior West German official 
privately told U.S. officials this week that his government favors "more 
caution" in approaching the Soviet Bloc, to reassure the Kremlin that the West 
is not seeking to change Europe's political map too abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long run, the strains between Bonn and the rest of the alliance appear 
likely to persist. All three nuclear powers in NATO -- the United States, 
Britain and France -- were strongly opposed to Genscher's demands for early 
negotiations to remove short-range nuclear forces from German soil. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of the week within the Bush White House may be that the sometimes 
ungainly Administration can act decisively and effectively, provided it 
bypasses its own bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
As Administration officials tell the tale, Bush's arms control proposal had 
been under consideration in general terms for many months but was hammered into 
specifics rapidly, by a small circle of trusted aides. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft had set up a two-track 
system in foreign policy, they said. The first track was a set of formal policy 
reviews undertaken by the existing bureaucracy, to assess "what the state of 
the world is now, how it has changed, where we want to see it going," one aide 
said. That produced the somewhat dispiriting conclusion that the Administration 
should essentially continue with the policies in place, an approach that was 
dubbed "status quo plus." 
</P>
<P>
The second track -- less formal, but ultimately more important -- was a small 
group of aides charged by Scowcroft and Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
with developing proposals for new policies that Bush could present. The small 
group, which included Scowcroft's deputy, Robert M. Gates, along with Baker 
aides Dennis Ross and Robert B. Zoellick and Undersecretary of Defense Paul D. 
Wolfowitz, was intended to produce new and specific ideas -- and to keep them 
from leaking into the press. 
</P>
<P>
"New ideas are going to come from this staff, not from the bureaucracy," an 
official recalled Scowcroft saying at a staff meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
The "turning point," an official said, came May 19, when the key members of the 
small group met with Bush at his seaside retreat in Maine. They reviewed the 
new proposals -- which by that time had been "scrubbed" by the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff -- and Bush dispatched two aides to Europe to brief key allied leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's evident satisfaction at the outcome suggests that he may resort to that 
approach again when his policies need a boost. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the political arrows might have been fired my way," he told a 
reporter in response to a question about the earlier criticism of his policies, 
"it's all been worth it, because I think we have something sound and solid to 
build on now."

POSTAL INSPECTORS DELIVER IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>

<P>
The Postal Inspection Service is trying to help America stamp out drugs by 
sending gun-toting inspectors to deliver arrest warrants along with drug-filled 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
"In fiscal 1988, we arrested 425 people for distributing narcotics through the 
mail," inspector Tom McClure said. "In the first six months of this fiscal 
year, we have arrested 440 people." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many government agencies that announce their total drug seizures with 
great fanfare, the postal inspectors are so low key about their work that the 
spokesman could not come up with the total amount of illicit drugs they seized 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, however, because of the nature of the mail system, the Postal 
Inspection Service does not make large seizures that could compare with those 
by other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"In a boat or a container ship or an airliner, they can move tons in those kind 
of things," he said. "In the mail you can't do that, at least not in an 
individual package." 
</P>
<P>
McClure declined to give many details on the service's operations, saying: "The 
bad guys read newspapers too." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the service gets help from other agencies such as the Customs 
Service, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and local police while 
developing its own cases through informants and other tips. 
</P>
<P>
The service's recent finds include $8,000 worth of PCP packed in baby food jars 
and being mailed from Los Angeles to Broken Arrow, Okla., and illicit steroids 
being distributed by two men in Miami who were arrested in mid-April. Officials 
said the latter case -- which involved a two-year investigation by postal 
inspectors and the FBI -- was the largest illicit steroid ring ever busted. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Inspection Service has no idea how much drugs are moving through the 
U.S. mail because it is illegal for the agency to inspect the mail without a 
federal warrant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the service presumes the amount is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a direct relationship between the amount of drugs in society and the 
amount being passed through the Postal Service," McClure said. When one mode of 
transporting drugs is shut down, "dealers find new avenues to move the 
narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,800 postal inspectors nationwide, about 800 do criminal investigations 
including mail fraud, child pornography and internal theft, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The number focusing full time on drugs doubled from 50 to 100 in the current 
fiscal year, McClure said. And when a case comes along, other inspectors are 
put to work on it. "We'll even bring them from across the country if the 
magnitude of the case calls for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mailings are not limited to any part of the country, he said. "There are 
mailings from Miami to California, from New York to Miami. It's crazy."

Private mail services such as United Parcel Service and Federal Express are not 
scrutinized as carefully as the U.S. mail. Spokesmen for both companies said 
they cooperate with authorities on drug investigations, but neither would 
indicate exactly how often this has occurred or whether the companies 
instigated any probes.

The Customs Service is cooperating with the Postal Service to clear mail from 
29 high-risk drug source countries at the port of arrival, according to Dennis 
Shimkoski of Customs. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of fiscal 1989, which began last October, Customs seized 65 
pounds of heroin, 216 pounds of opium, 10 pounds of cocaine and 297 pounds of 
marijuana at the 21 international mail branches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1988, Customs seized 164 pounds of heroin, 1,600 pounds of opium and 
1,310 pounds of marijuana. There were no significant amounts of cocaine 
intercepted, Shimkoski said.

Explosions leveled three buildings at a gunpowder plant in Roxbury Township, 
N.J., Saturday, injuring at least 18 people, blowing out windows in nearby 
towns and shaking houses up to 13 miles away, authorities said. The cause of 
the blast was unknown. The explosions at the Hercules Powder Inc. plant knocked 
down trees, tore off doors and damaged many homes and about 80% of the 
businesses in this township, about 40 miles west of New York City, officials 
said. Three of about 40 buildings at the complex were destroyed and several 
were damaged, a company manager said. Twelve people were treated and released 
at a local hospital. Three were admitted with injuries ranging from back pains 
to a concussion. All werein stable condition, supervisor Barbara Treverrow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Best said the material that exploded Saturday was a smokeless propellant used 
in shotgun shells. 
</P>
<P>
He said that to limit damage, the plant is divided into compartments that each 
contain no more than 1,000 pounds of gunpowder. The gunpowder plant is located 
in a somewhat isolated ara near several small towns.

INFLATION-WORRIED FED PRESSURED TO STEM DOLLAR'S RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board is coming under increased pressure to reduce interest 
rates, even though some board members continue to fear that the U.S. economy is 
still growing too robustly to abandon concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure comes from U.S. trading partners and from the Bush Administration. 
Both want U.S. interest rates lowered to help stem the rise in the value of the 
dollar, which is threatening to stymie further reduction of the big U.S. trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Date Cited 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady both have said they are 
concerned about the dollar's rise. Brady told a meeting of the 24-nation 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development here last week that a 
continued rise in the value of the greenback will jeopardize the progress in 
reducing the trade deficit that the United States has made over the last 2 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The White House is also concerned that, if interest rates remain high for too 
long, the economy could be sent into a slump, dealing a blow to White House 
efforts to keep the federal budget deficit from increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Top Administration policy-makers believe the economy already has begun to slow 
sufficiently to relieve any inflationary pressures from last winter's sudden 
price surge. They fear that higher interest rates will exacerbate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Split on Interest Rates 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed is not as worried about the dollar's rise, and it still is split 
over whether to nudge interest rates down. 
</P>
<P>
Although opposition to reducing interest rates has begun to erode within the 
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, a telephone poll of members of 
that panel last week failed to produce a consensus on any new action. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank is expected to consider the issue again on Monday or Tuesday, 
before Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan goes to a conference with bankers in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
There is little question that reducing interest rates in the United States -- 
while they simultaneously go up in West Germany and Japan -- would blunt the 
dollar's rise. Part of the reason the greenback keeps edging up is that 
interest rates in the United States are higher than usual in relation to those 
in its two major economic allies, prompting currency traders to flock to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allies Face Inflation 
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty in West Germany and Japan also is contributing to the 
dollar's rise. So is growing inflation in those countries. And political 
turmoil in places like Argentina and China is strengthening the dollar's value 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is that the Big Three economic powers are split over how to 
handle the situation. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany and Japan, alarmed by the resurgence of inflation in their 
countries, are moving toward more restrictive economic policies. Japan raised 
its discount rate -- the interest charged on short-term loans to commercial 
banks -- last Tuesday. West Germany's Bundesbank has not moved yet, but it, 
like the Fed, is under increasing pressure every day. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration wants the Fed to take on most of the burden by 
reducing interest rates at home because it fears that interest-rate increases 
abroad might create recession in those countries, which could cause foreigners 
to buy fewer U.S. imports and hamper further progress in reducing the U.S. 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation Worries Continue 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have been making their views plain to Fed governors. 
But the Fed itself is divided: Some of the Fed's seven Washington-based 
governors are willing to consider a small reduction in interest rates, but the 
presidents of the system's regional banks -- who also sit on the Federal Open 
Market Committee -- believe inflation pressures in the United States still are 
too strong to discount. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Administration has been relatively restrained in its exhortations. 
The view among Treasury officials is that the sooner interest rates are reduced 
the better -- for the dollar and for the domestic economy. The Treasury, 
convinced that the economy has begun to slow and that inflation pressures will 
abate, is far less concerned than the Fed about the threat of spiraling prices. 
</P>
<P>
How long the Fed can hold out is unclear. The dollar edged down slightly on 
Friday, but its overall rise has sent traders rushing to bid prices still 
higher, overwhelming the so-far sporadic efforts of the Big Three central banks 
to intervene in the exchange markets to curb the dollar's rise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coordination Discounted 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the sense of urgency is the growing view in the foreign exchange 
markets that the long-touted policy coordination efforts of the United States 
and its economic allies are rapidly unraveling. If the Fed does not act soon, 
the dollar could keep rising higher and higher. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, many analysts believe, the Fed will act -- or, just as possibly, 
put off any action -- mainly for domestic reasons. There is little concern 
within the Federal Open Market Committee about the consequences of the rising 
dollar, and unless there is a run on the greenback -- the opposite of the 
current problem -- Fed officials are likely to let the markets have their way. 
</P>
<P>
These analysts say that, if the Administration prevails on the central bank to 
reduce interest rates for the sake of keeping the dollar's value down, the Fed 
will be acting more for public relations reasons than out of genuine concern 
about the trade deficit. That means any action that comes soon is likely to be 
small.

TORRENTIAL RAINS MAKE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK A 'GARDEN OF EDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WOODWARD, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WILPENA POUND, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Australian outback is normally a semi-arid scrubland stretching to the 
shores of a dry salt lake. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the wettest spells since Europeans reached the area in the mid-19th 
Century has completely transformed the desert heart of the world's driest 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
The outback is now miles of golf course-like green merging into Lake Torrens, 
which is full for the first time in recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big Wet has turned a dust bowl into the Garden of Eden," said Brent 
Williams, wildlife ranger in Flinders Park National Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foot of Rain Falls 
</P>
<P>
Parched outback areas in Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory 
were deluged with a foot of rain in March, three times the annual average for 
the Red Center. 
</P>
<P>
Creeks, dry for years on end, turned overnight into torrents hundreds of yards 
wide, flooding huge areas. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the floodwater headed for the sprinkling of salt lakes in the northern 
section of South Australia and in particular Lake Eyre, which attracts water 
from an area roughly the combined size of France, Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the downpour, Lake Eyre, which usually is covered by a thick 
salt crust lying 50 feet below sea level, has become the world's 16th biggest 
lake after filling for only the fourth time since white settlers first came 
upon it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds Flock to Area 
</P>
<P>
Pelicans, terns and other birds have flocked in from the coast by the thousands 
to breed on the lakes, which should stay full for several months, and perhaps a 
year or more, after further heavy rain in southern Queensland over the last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The rain reaps huge, sudden benefits. Last month, rangers found over 100,000 
nests of the banded stilt, a wading bird thought to be extinct in South 
Australia, on an island in flooded Lake Torrens. 
</P>
<P>
Food for the bird life is provided by fresh-water fish -- bream, gudgeon and 
perch -- that have washed down flooded rivers to the lakes, which become 
breeding grounds for every kind of insect life. 
</P>
<P>
The water also causes extraordinary happenings further down the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
The water-holding frog is awakened after spending many years cocooned in an 
underground cell while shrimp, crabs and plankton appear -- from where remains 
a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eggs Have Lain Dormant 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that most of the salt-tolerant creatures are products of eggs lying 
dormant in the mud for perhaps decades," said Gordon Stanger, lecturer in earth 
sciences at Adelaide's Flinders University, after studying Lake Torrens. 
</P>
<P>
Bushes, grasses and trees are showing luxuriant growth, while flowers, normally 
dormant as the winter season approaches, are growing at breakneck speed in an 
attempt to complete their life cycle before dry conditions return. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, hit by several years of drought conditions, have also profited from 
the downpour. 
</P>
<P>
"Paddocks have been opened up, distress sales are no longer necessary and 
farmers can afford to fatten up stock," said accountant Phil Camens in Alice 
Springs. "They are pretty happy, and it looks like I'm going to be busy over 
the next months." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden fall in cattle sales led to record auction prices in the Darling 
Downs area of southern Queensland as exporters found it hard to fulfill 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Problems, Too 
</P>
<P>
However, the rain has also brought its share of problems for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The floods washed away much precious topsoil and destroyed sections of a 
6,040-mile fence -- the longest man-made object in the world -- erected to 
control the country's wild dingo dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy sheep losses from dingo attacks have been reported in outback areas 
recently, and more than 120 of the wild dogs are reported to be roaming inside 
the fence in South Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Darling Downs, the nation's breadbasket, is suffering from a plague of mice, 
with about 30% of summer grain crops in the area estimated to have been eaten 
by the rodents. 
</P>
<P>
To beat the mice, farmers are harvesting grain prematurely and drying it by 
machine, an extremely costly exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"If the plague is not curtailed by the end of next month, we can expect extreme 
danger," one farmer said. "The other day, three kids at my neighbor's place 
killed 750 mice in 30 minutes."

N. CAROLINA PROGRAM GIVES PRISONERS JOB SKILLS

<P>
Dale Brittain has no illusions that the forestry program he supervises for 
young prison inmates will help all of them, but authorities say a little 
respect and some incentives can go a long way toward helping some. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're at the bottom and have never had anything, anything is important 
to you," Brittain said. "These boys come from a rough background. Some of them 
you're going to change, some of them you're not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work in Mountains 
</P>
<P>
Inmates who participate in the BRIDGE program range in age from 18 to 25 and 
learn such skills as carpentry, forestry, logging and fighting forest fires in 
the state's three mountain districts. 
</P>
<P>
BRIDGE is an acronym for Building, Rehabilitating, Instructing, Developing, 
Growing and Employing. 
</P>
<P>
Brittain credits the program's success to incentives. 
</P>
<P>
There is "gain time" -- for every eight hours a BRIDGE inmate works, a day is 
subtracted from his sentence. The inmates wear special uniforms with logging 
boots and get a break from prison food by eating at restaurants near work 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
At the program's administrative offices at the Burke Youth Center, there is a 
display of photographs of the participants, with the inmate of the month at the 
top. That is another incentive, Brittain said, because some of the inmates have 
never had an 8-by-10 photograph of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Did Something Wrong' 
</P>
<P>
"They're not Boy Scouts," added Carl Johnson, who directs the BRIDGE program 
from Raleigh. "They did something wrong. But, if you treat them well, you get 
something back." 
</P>
<P>
The participants in Avery County are constructing buildings that will house up 
to 50 inmates in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to five young inmates skimming the bark off a pine tree at a makeshift 
sawmill, Gary Poole, a Division of Forest Resources project leader, said, 
"That's a good crew right there. They actually hunt work to do." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, several young men used hammers and handsaws to put the finishing 
touches on one of three buildings resembling vacation lodges that are perched 
on a hillside in the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learns Sawmill Work 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Tony Walker, who is serving a three-year sentence for breaking and 
entering, had never seen a sawmill before but took to the work quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot better than sitting around all day," said Walker, 22, who entered 
the program about four months ago and has about seven months left. "They treat 
you just like you're at work." 
</P>
<P>
Some inmates are chosen to work on the "helitack crew," which fights forest 
fires from a bright yellow helicopter equipped with a collapsible water bucket. 
</P>
<P>
While they are building the camp facilities, the program's 26 inmates are 
temporarily housed at the Burke Youth Center. Instructors from nearby Mayland 
Community College have provided training in carpentry and masonry, but no 
professional contractors have been hired. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it we just beat and bang and learn ourselves," Brittain said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Chance to Develop Skills 
</P>
<P>
Harry Layman, director of the Division of Forest Resources, said that the young 
prisoners have a chance to develop skills, such as carpentry and plumbing, and 
they are also attracted to the program because they are treated less like 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our nicest compliment on the program was (when) one young man gave up his 
parole to stay in the program," Layman said. "The kids begin to feel part of 
something. We treat them with respect." 
</P>
<P>
Since the program was begun in 1986, it has taken in 206 inmates. About a dozen 
have reentered the prison system, Brittain said. Others have been hired by the 
state forestry division and private employers. 
</P>
<P>
The youths volunteer for the program and are carefully screened, Brittain said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Resembles CCC 
</P>
<P>
Layman compared the program with the Civilian Conservation Corps begun by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
"It's using the forest as remedial," he said. "There is something healing about 
taking them out in the woods and letting them work with nature. 
</P>
<P>
"We cut down the logs, then build the camp ourselves with our forestry 
supervisors and the inmate labor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Layman said the program was born from a union of the state's prison and 
forestry divisions after a fire in Burke County destroyed 47 homes built on 
"little switchback roads." 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of just two east of the Mississippi, state forest officials 
said. The other is in Florida. The BRIDGE program, modeled after similar 
programs in California and Oregon, uses only young, minimum-custody prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earns Time Off 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Bruton, 21, has been in the program 19 months. He has earned 674 hours 
of "gain time" -- enough for more than 2 1/2 months off his sentence -- and has 
nearly completed a 13-year prison term for breaking and entering. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear of forest fires on TV," Bruton said. "They offered it to me, and I 
thought it would give me a change from regular prison." 
</P>
<P>
Bruton has learned carpentry, landscaping and the operation of heavy equipment, 
such as bulldozers and a "knuckleboom loader" used by the logging industry. He 
has also spent 18 months on the helitack team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned so much," he said. "I didn't know nothing before I came in."

A team of Roto-Rooter employees went beyond the call of duty to retrieve a 
$5,000 engagement ring a San Jose woman accidentally flushed down the toilet 
just a day before her wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Their efforts, which included tearing up the front lawn and flushing gallons of 
water into a sewer main, paid off. Trish McDonald's ring was saved from a 
watery grave on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them all the champagne out of my refrigerator," said McDonald, a 
27-year-old flight attendant. "I was just passing it out in the street." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who had been preoccupied with pre-wedding arrangements, forgot she 
had wrapped the ring in toilet paper to protect it. After she wiped the sink 
dry with some other toilet paper, she flushed the whole clump. 
</P>
<P>
"I just about hyperventilated on the floor. I said, 'This is the beginning of

forget what they thought about the city before and notice what is good about it 
now. 
</P>
<P>
In 1889 Queen Victoria, who had her own misgivings about the place, granted 
Birmingham its city charter. That is the reason for the centennial. But the 
city is using the occasion to bury a recession that wiped out more than 200,000 
jobs and ravaged its traditional metals industry. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 1.05 million, which is 100 miles northwest of London, is hoping the 
yearlong celebration will clear away its image as a cultural wasteland and 
sterile, concrete jungle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birmingham-Bashing 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham-bashing is as old as the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
History books tell of Victoria's drawing the shades of her royal carriage to 
block out its industrial soot, gloom and grime when she came here on her 
travels through the English Midlands. 
</P>
<P>
In her 1816 novel, "Emma," Jane Austen wrote: "One has no great hopes for 
Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound." 
</P>
<P>
Explained Andrew Fretter, City Hall's principal marketing officer: 
"Manufacturing used to be a very dirty industry. It's not any more. People 
haven't yet adjusted to that new situation." 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham has been a trading center for centuries, although the "Domesday 
Book" of 1086 rated it one of the poorest in Warwickshire County. 
</P>
<P>
It prospered during the 16th Century as a finishing center and marketing outlet 
for basic metal goods from the surrounding area and is acknowledged to have 
been the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution long before it became a city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diverse Population 
</P>
<P>
As England's workshop, Birmingham attracted a rich diversity of immigrants, 
primarily from Britain's far-flung empire, until the recession struck in 1979. 
"It hit hard," Fretter said. "Vast swaths in the city of Birmingham were left 
totally derelict." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Bore, chairman of the economic development committee of the Labor 
Party-controlled City Council, said: "The shakeout of the Birmingham economy 
was catastrophic, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham's recovery was spurred by the council's sponsorship of several 
megaprojects, including a modern science park and the $215-million 
International Convention Center scheduled to open in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
It also spent the equivalent of $2.5 million on a bid to host the 1992 Summer 
Olympics. The bid failed -- Spain won out -- but it signified the new 
confidence of a city that only two years ago came in dead last in a survey of 
the quality of life in 38 British cities. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its traditional prides and joys -- more canals than Venice, Italy; 
Europe's largest public library; a rating as having the best tap water of any 
big city in the world, even if it is piped in from Wales -- Birmingham is 
scheduling $2.5 billion for development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Manufacturing 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production has outstripped the previous record set in 1979, 80% 
of manufacturers are working at more than 90% capacity and unemployment has 
fallen to 7.5% from 1982's peak of 16.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Austin set up his automobile works in the city's Longbridge district in 
1905 and pioneered the popular Austin 7. Today, Birmingham holds Britain's only 
street-circuit car race, the annual Super Prix, and the auto industry is once 
again the city's largest employer, home to the Rover Group's modern robotic car 
plant and the Austin Morris division of British Leyland Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Business travel to the city, streamlined by a modern international airport, has 
helped create 73,000 jobs and has made Birmingham the fifth-most-visited city 
in England. Visitors spent the equivalent of $635 million here in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Brummies," as Birmingham's residents are known, concede that they must now pay 
attention to how their city looks, as well as how it works. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, most of the city's Victorian heart was torn out and replaced by 
featureless concrete and mirror glass buildings, surrounded -- some say 
strangled -- by a beltway. 
</P>
<P>
Its architectural style is still symbolized by two of its best-known landmarks 
-- the Bull Ring, a covered shopping complex soon to be replaced by a 
$688-million continental-style arcade, and Spaghetti Junction, a vast 
crisscrossing of roads, cloverleafs and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
The planners "ripped the city apart in the 1950s and '60s," Bore said. "The 
drive to clear the slums and to provide for the age of the motorcar lacked the 
sensitivity the planning community now has." 
</P>
<P>
The city has an eclectic mixture of performing arts: UB40, the acclaimed 
multiracial rock group, comes from Birmingham; "Spitting Images," the wickedly 
satirical puppet show, is produced here, and Simon Rattle, the Wunderkind of 
British conductors, has led the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra since he was 25 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent coup, the City Council lured the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet from 
London with a $10.3-million financing offer. The traveling section of the Royal 
Ballet will move into the 1,950-seat Hippodrome in August, 1990.

BANGLADESH'S LANDLESS POOR GO HUNGRY

Zarina Khatoon sold her aluminum cooking pot to buy food for her four hungry 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooking pot was the last asset I could sell. My children were going 
without food for two days. They had nothing but water," Zarina said, wearing a 
ragged sari and sitting on the ground in front of her mud-and-straw house. 
</P>
<P>
Her plight is common among the families of 65 million landless day laborers in 
this poverty-stricken nation of 110 million people. When there are no fields to 
tend, there is no money to earn. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamalpur district, 90 miles north of Dhaka, was ravaged by last summer's 
monsoon-spawned floods. Now it suffers from drought. But so far the main 
problem is not availability of food, relief workers say. It's the shortage of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The sowing season is over. For landless day laborers, there will be no more 
work until the rice crop now in the ground is harvested in early June -- if the 
paddies survive the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Zarina Khatoon's husband, Mokbul Ahmad, left home to look for work. Two weeks 
later, he had not returned to Palashtala, 12 miles south of Jamalpur. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he left, Zarina sold her cooking pot for 15 takas, about 46 
cents. She promptly spent 31 cents on 2.2 pounds of flour, which saw her family 
through two meals. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old woman said her situation had improved slightly since she found 
work digging a pond for 15 takas a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, I cannot buy rice for my family," she said. "Rice is out of my reach." 
</P>
<P>
Rice is the staple of the Bangladeshi diet. Two weeks ago, low-quality rice 
sold for 28 cents a pound. The government pumped some reserve stocks into the 
area, and the price fell a little -- to 25 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the question of availability of rice. The problem is the poor people 
have no money to buy food. They have no jobs," said Fakhrul Ahsan, a local 
worker for the privately run Bangladesh Rural Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He said the committee is working with 56,000 people living in 47 villages in 
the Jamalpur region, doing post-flood rehabilitation work and trying to provide 
jobs such as building roads and making handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost 30% of the people we cover are living in extreme conditions," Ahsan 
said. "They take flour and boil it with water. They can't make bread from wheat 
as that fails to feed all the members of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lean period for agriculture workers. There is no work in the fields 
until the next harvest comes. The poor, landless people eat on days they can 
work. On workless days they go without food," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no report of anyone dying for lack of food, but the situation is 
pretty bad," said Debabrata Das, another worker from the Bangladesh Rural 
Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hamid, who lives in Narayanpur near Palashtala, said he earned 15 takas a 
day working for wealthy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"The money I earn cannot buy rice for me and my family," the 35-year-old father 
of three said. "Rice has become a luxury item for us." 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, where the per-capita annual income is $160, needs 18.5 million tons 
of rice and wheat a year to feed its people. In good years, it produces 17 
million tons. It tries to import an additional 2 million tons to cover the 
shortfall and provide an emergency reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the floods wiped out 2.5 million tons. The spring rice crop now in 
the ground was expected to produce about 5.6 million tons, but agriculture 
officials in Dhaka fear at least half will be lost to the drought.

AT INDEPENDENT STUDY SCHOOL, MOST LEARNING OCCURS OUTSIDE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At Monte Vista High School in Costa Mesa, there are no junior or senior proms, 
no pep rallies, no class clowns, no mass crowds in the hallway between classes, 
no social hierarchy. Teachers do not lecture in front of a roomful of students. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there is a quiet calm over the campus, where just eight teachers toil 
away in one wing of what was once an elementary school. No more than two 
students sit in the hourlong classes at a time, except for math labs, where 
there are four. 
</P>
<P>
Graduation for many students is a trip to the school's office, where Rose 
Smith, the registrar, plops a red mortarboard on their heads and finds them a 
matching gown, so she can shoot a couple of snapshots of the graduate standing 
in the middle of the school's courtyard, a diploma in hand. 
</P>
<P>
On each teacher's desk is a telephone so the instructor can call students to 
find out why they failed to make it to class or why school work was not turned 
in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent Study 
</P>
<P>
But for Monte Vista students, most of the learning takes place outside the 
classroom. The Costa Mesa high school is an independent study program that 
enables students to complete high school requirements at their own pace, while 
they concentrate on jobs or other projects. 
</P>
<P>
One boy gets his assignments by facsimile machine in the South Pacific, where 
his family is on a one-year vacation. Another girl with a modeling assignment 
in Barbados mails in her homework. Other students are from single-parent homes 
and have to work to contribute to the family income. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no state rule (on who can go through independent study), but our rule 
is that a youngster must have a good reason why he can't attend school on a 
regular daily basis," Principal Carole Castaldo said. "We try to discourage a 
student who wants to go surfing or lay on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Programs such as Castaldo's have been around for 12 years, since the 
Legislature allowed school districts to offer independent study. But lately, 
enrollment in such programs has been booming, even in places where enrollment 
overall is declining, such as the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, of 
which Monte Vista is a part. 
</P>
<P>
Each year since Monte Vista was set up, Castaldo said, enrollment has doubled. 
There are now 350 students in the program; 134 were graduated last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased by Half 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, enrollment in independent study programs has increased almost 50% in 
the last five years, according to Lynn Hartzler of the state Department of 
Education's alternative education unit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these students, Castaldo said, "are a result of a new generation of 
parents -- parents that didn't necessarily follow a straight and narrow path. 
And now they're raising kids who are saying, 'We don't want a traditional 
program.' . . . I think that's why attendance is growing -- and it sure is 
growing." 
</P>
<P>
With a statewide dropout rate of more than 30%, educators have been forced to 
develop alternative education programs, such as independent study, to reach 
students whom traditional schools do not seem to touch, said William Habermehl, 
assistant superintendent of the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
For some students, they have found, learning is more successful if education is 
stripped down to its most basic components: a student, books and 
self-motivation to learn, with a little guidance from a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"At many of the alternative education programs, you'll find many very polite 
kids, kids with very high IQs who just kind of walk to the beat of a different 
drummer," Habermehl said. "They don't learn well in the confines of a 30-to-1 
teaching-ratio classroom. They want a 1-on-1 or 3-on-1 situation. In these 
programs, they thrive." 
</P>
<P>
Castaldo is quick to point out that Monte Vista is not "an easy way out" or "a 
quick way to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
It is not a school for losers, she said. "It takes a lot of self-discipline and 
responsibility to be successful at this." 
</P>
<P>
Two prerequisites for Monte Vista are that students be at least 16 and show 
good reasons why they cannot attend a regular high school, either because of a 
job or other activity that will keep them busy. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista, like many other state independent programs, allows students as old 
as 21 to attend. But Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget for next year 
would eliminate money for students older than 18 in any public school program 
except adult education. 
</P>
<P>
Another requirement for independent study -- the strictest one -- is that 
students and their parents or guardians must sign a contract stating that the 
student will complete a certain amount of work during a set period. If that 
work is not submitted on time, the student is dropped from Monte Vista three 
weeks after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
There are almost as many reasons for students to enroll at Monte Vista as there 
are students. 
</P>
<P>
Model Terri Raitt's face has graced the cover of Teen Magazine four times, and 
she has been in several commercials lately. She was signed recently by the 
giant Wilhelmina modeling agency. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt, 19, is from Florida and got her first modeling job during a vacation in 
California four years ago, when she entered the Face of the '80s contest and 
was signed by the Nina Blanchard agency. The next year, against her parents' 
wishes, she left home to devote herself full time to modeling and acting in 
California -- and also left education behind. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt's modeling career is skyrocketing, but she has decided she had better get 
her high school diploma. Monte Vista seemed the best way to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to take the G.E.D. (equivalency diploma), but to me that's not a 
real diploma," Raitt said. Instead, she has been taking two courses at a time, 
between modeling assignments in Japan and Europe, and has gained enough credits 
to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"This school is really good for kids who are into acting or modeling," she 
said. "This is perfect for me. When you're a model or work in the business, you 
can't make your own hours. When they call you for a shoot, you have to be able 
to go. They work with you here (at Monte Vista). They're real versatile, 
because they want you to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
Another Monte Vista student, Shannon Anderson, 16, said she used to "live for 
the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
As a student at Newport Harbor High School, Shannon said, she "ditched" school 
frequently, adding: "I used to get into trouble a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon said she found schoolwork "not challenging enough." Now she works full 
time at a Miller's Outpost store, paying her parents for room and board and 
getting A's in her classes at Monte Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"I go visit my high school friends, and I just can't handle it," she said about 
conventional schools. "They say, 'Let's go toilet-paper (drape with streams of 
tissues) the girls' restroom,' and I think, 'What for?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procrastinating Doesn't Work 
</P>
<P>
The self-discipline was difficult at first, Shannon said. Like many new 
students at Monte Vista, in her first few weeks she put off her schoolwork 
until the last minute, then panicked when it came time to turn in assignments. 
She soon found that procrastinating would not work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to fall back anymore," she said. "I want to graduate next year. I 
think to myself, 'You've gotta grow up, you've gotta get a job and go to 
school. You can't be a screaming little high school kid anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Shannon plans to spend her last semester at Harbor High School, because she 
does not want to miss out on the fun of a conventional senior year. She is 
excited because she has been asked by a boy to attend this year's junior-senior 
prom at her old high school. 
</P>
<P>
Onofrio D'Amato, 17, sometimes spends 17 hours a day helping with the family's 
fishing business off Newport Beach. Born in Italy, Onofrio has become a dory 
fisherman like his father, who still fishes the old-fashioned way. They take 
turns going out on the boat every day and manually bring in 200 to 500 pounds 
of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fish is sold in a stand at the beach. Even before the boat is 
ashore, it usually is met by a small crowd clamoring for the best of the day's 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
The operation is a family affair. The younger children spend hours attaching 
bait to each hook on the long lines. Family members take turns cleaning and 
cutting fish for customers. Now that Onofrio is older and strong enough, he too 
goes out alone on the boat, at 3 a.m. when the fishing is best. 
</P>
<P>
Onofrio had attended a regular high school. But as he began taking over duties 
once exclusive to his father, it was becoming increasingly difficult to fit 
schooling into his work schedule. So he attends Monte Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"My father needed me," he said. "It's hard work, and he just couldn't do it 
alone anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Onofrio often brings fish for his teachers. Castaldo described him as one of 
the school's more conscientious students. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Hill, 17, moved here from the Bay Area to pursue an acting career. She 
has been in several commercials and several locally produced short films. To 
support herself, she also holds down two jobs, as a waitress in a Balboa Island 
restaurant and as a manager at another restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
In between, she is taking a world history and a drama class at Monte Vista, 
working toward graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole said she sometimes gets comments from friends who think that because she 
is going to Monte Vista she is "getting off easy." 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm working just as hard," she said. "Sometimes, the work is a little 
harder here (than in regular high school), sometimes a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this a lot more, because I like being more independent," Nicole said. 
"Sometimes I miss the school dances and all the school life. But I keep myself 
really busy." 
</P>
<P>
That students "get off easy" and slack off in schoolwork even more than in a 
traditional high school are criticisms that teachers often hear. But Monte 
Vista teachers said that does not happen for very long, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
Work must be turned in every week to show that a student is keeping up with 
studies. If the student does not come in -- or mail in the work, in some cases 
-- the teacher calls. Teachers have time to do that because they have a smaller 
student load than teachers at other high schools. 
</P>
<P>
If students fail to hand in assignments after three weeks, they are dropped 
from the program. 
</P>
<P>
"They call us and say they couldn't come because they had an emergency, and I 
ask, 'Well, what emergency?' " said Beverly Smith, a math and algebra teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courses of 4 to 5 Weeks 
</P>
<P>
Each course lasts about four to five weeks and is the equivalent of a semester. 
Digesting so much material in that short a time might be difficult, especially 
because it is done almost entirely independent of teachers, Smith said. But 
that is no excuse for failure. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, they should start reaching stumbling blocks," she said about 
students' lessons. "But I am here every day. It is up to them to find a friend 
or a relative or an enemy, or us, and ask us for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my students I'm here to walk the path with them. But if they're not 
here when they should be, I will call boyfriends, girlfriends, mothers or 
fathers about why they are not here," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The school offers almost every course found in traditional high schools: 
English, algebra, economics, psychology, French, German, history, geography, 
physical science -- the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the philosophy at Monte Vista is that if a student is 
interested in a particular subject, and the course is not offered, the school 
will try to provide that course. 
</P>
<P>
It helps to have a teaching staff with a wide background and interests. The 
eight teachers at Monte Vista say they are as untraditional as their students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're misfits," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Black, an English and drama teacher, for example, frequently appears in 
local theater productions and has performed on the New York stage. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Grade, a languages teacher, played in a chamber orchestra in Europe. The 
others have also done interesting things with their own lives that students can 
use for models. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers said this system is not a guaranteed success for students, but failure 
seldom happens here because individualized attention is available. Also, the 
pace for courses is, for the most part, the student's option. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the distinct advantage of putting the game ball where it belongs: with 
the student," history teacher Marc Katz said. "To us, it's not the teacher who 
teaches. We're more the learning facilitators. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell the students: 'The job of educating you is now your job.' "

It's mid-morning on 11th Avenue near Broadway. A few drug peddlers and junkies 
stand in front of a boarded-up pool hall looking for prospective customers or 
buys. Down the avenue, Richard Garcia's clippers are buzzing while Ray Martsolf 
watches and gives advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure to go with the grain of the hair, otherwise a mistake could really 
show up," says Martsolf, as Garcia guides the whirring clippers over the skull 
of a 10-year-old boy who wants his close-cropped Afro to have "cuts" like those 
favored by many professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 29, a former heroin addict, concentrates on the boy's hair and tries 
not to think about the availability of drugs down the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daily Temptation 
</P>
<P>
"I get tempted every day," he says. "When I leave at night, the peddlers will 
ask: 'Do you want weed, dope, crack?' But if I come in here strung out, I 
wouldn't be able to keep my hands steady when I have to cut or shave. I'm not 
interested in that life anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia wants to be a barber. There are 13 of them in his family. 
</P>
<P>
It's been about a year and a half since he gave up guns, knives, his brutal 
heroin habit and the leadership of an Oceanside gang for a pair of shears and a 
chance to learn the trade he hopes will support his wife and four young 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who will take the state barber license exam in June, is one of the 31 
students who are learning the trade from Martsolf and instructor Warren Norman 
at the Associated Barber College downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The students' reasons for trimming hair, shaving faces and performing facials 
are vastly different. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's reason was a way out of the vicious world of drug abuse and violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Proud of It' 
</P>
<P>
"If you stay in gangs, you'll either be dead or end up in prison," he said. 
"I've been to prison three times, and I'm not proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
He says he committed his first burglary at age 10. At age 15, he was charged 
with the attempted murder of four men he stabbed. The last sentence he served 
was four years for cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the barrel-chested Garcia, whose arms are covered with tattoos, 
gives advice to youngsters who sit in one of the college's 32 green Naugahyde 
barber chairs while he clips their hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, you can be a tough guy and still be good," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Martsolf, who owns the college and has seen thousands of students over the last 
23 years, says his motivation for staying in business comes from seeing the 
transformation of barbers-in-training like Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest majority of my students come from families that have barbers 
somewhere along the line," Martsolf said. "But I've had all types. I've had 
them out of the penitentiary and out of drug rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Students 
</P>
<P>
Not all of his students have tainted pasts. A few chairs down, Marisa Flores is 
shaving a customer's face with a straight razor, after applying hot towels and 
shaving cream. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, 29, a recent widow with three children who just became a U.S. citizen, 
wants to be a barber "because I want to support myself and I don't want to live 
off of welfare." She laughs when she says it took an hour and a half the first 
time she shaved a customer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very nervous, and the man was very understanding, even though I nicked 
him a few times," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
With a spot waiting for her at one of her brother-in-law's two shops, Flores is 
honing her barber skills while waiting to take her exam in October. 
</P>
<P>
For 66-year-old Victoria Smith, a barber's license will strengthen the 
cosmetology license she has held since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to revise my shaving skills," she said. "My father had 19 children, and 
we learned to shave from him because we all took turns. But I know barbers have 
a different way of shaving." 
</P>
<P>
And Arsenio Ortanez yearned to learn the barber trade so he could escape what 
he called the office politics and frustration of being an electrical draftsman 
for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
Ortanez, 23, hopes to work in his aunt's barbershop in San Francisco until he 
can buy his own shop. 
</P>
<P>
"The work you do you take full credit for," Ortanez said. "Here, it's like an 
art."

DRUGS: A TRUE EMERGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've been to homes of parents whose children have been shot on the streets. 
Gangs and violence closed good, bright eyes before they could truly see the 
world. I've heard people cry in front of a hundred others as we marched to 
mourn with them the senseless death of a young person in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
I've taken the phone calls from people in La Jolla and Scripps Ranch who lament 
the loss of their children to cocaine, crystal and crack.They did not die on 
the streets, but they are dead to work and beauty nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
So it is with bitter reception that I met the immediate negative undertone in 
the questions from media about Mayor O'Connor's call for a "state of 
emergency." Time will tell if she is merely passing the buck to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, for the present, can we appreciate a metaphor? Are we so cynical 
that we cannot appreciate a creative political statement -- one that has the 
potential to galvanize the people in a way that will produce funds to fight to 
save our children, to save our communities? An "emergency" does exist and not 
in Southeast San Diego alone. 
</P>
<P>
Our city is under siege today, as more and more drug dealers and crystal makers 
from other sections of the country come here to exploit a naive community for 
filthy profit.It is an "emergency." The crisis is gradually choking the life 
and heart out of our beautiful and great city. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not get trapped in our own strategic technicalities. The facts are 
simple: The state has $2.5 billion in unallocated resources, a significant 
portion of which must go to schools under the Constitution; the city of San 
Diego is suffering death and rising crime in the streets; and we need an 
infusion from the surplus to protect our future. But make no mistake about it, 
we will expect the city manager to fund the relief effort in this "emergency" 
should the governor turn a cold ear to our plea.

SOUTH BAY BOAT PEOPLE FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO LIVE AFLOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH E. BROWN, Joseph E. Brown is a free-lance writer and sailor who lives 
ashore in Coronado. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not far from my home in Coronado is one of San Diego County's most unusual 
residential communities: Emory Cove, a small indentation in south San Diego Bay 
between Coronado and Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In most respects, its residents differ little from their counterparts in El 
Cajon, Del Mar or Escondido. They pay taxes, work at 9-to-5 jobs, vote, fret 
over inflation, send their kids to school, shop at the same supermarket where I 
shop. But there's one big difference. Emory Cove's 60 or so citizens don't live 
in houses, apartments, condos, mobile homes or even tents. They live aboard 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, an estimated 65,000 Americans live on the water (about 700 in San 
Diego), either in full-service marinas or, like the self-named "Mud-Ducks" of 
Emory Cove, "swinging on the hook" in anchorages without electricity, water 
supply, mail delivery, telephones or other shoreside amenities. Called 
"liveaboards," their dwellings range from cramped, cockleshell sailboats whose 
owners make do with old-fashioned iceboxes and kerosene for lighting and 
cooking, to sumptuous mega-yachts complete with microwave ovens, deep freezes, 
color TV and sunken bathtubs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences in life styles, however, all liveaboards share one 
major frustration: in varying degrees, they wear the mantle of second-class 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
In the mind of most landlubbers, boat living conjures up a very romantic image: 
golden sunsets over the water, a low-cost, free-and-easy, 
to-hell-with-convention life style, and, best of all, the ability to weigh 
anchor and sail off into the sunset when the neighbors get on the nerves. 
</P>
<P>
To an extent, that image is valid. The five years that my wife, Anne, and I 
lived aboard our vintage, 36-foot yawl in Shelter Cove Marina on Shelter Island 
were among the most memorable of our married lives. Once you accept dry rot and 
fungus as a fact of life, once you adjust to an almost total lack of privacy, 
once you overcome the claustrophobia of living, eating, resting, working and 
sleeping in a dwelling only 36 feet long by 9 feet wide (about one-fourth the 
square footage found in the most modest American tract home) the advantages of 
the water living pile up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the other side of the coin? For one thing, my liveaboard friends 
complain, there is little sympathy from the tax collector if you live on the 
water. Whether by design or accident, state and local authorities increasingly 
have singled out liveaboards for special taxes on boats used as homes. 
</P>
<P>
California, for instance, imposes no sales tax on buying a shoreside home but 
it collects 7% of the purchase price of a boat, even if the vessel is to be 
used full-time as a residence. For a $100,000 boat (not an exorbitant price 
these days) that's $7,000 the buyer must cough up that his landlubber neighbor 
does not. Admittedly, California does grant boat dwellers the same property tax 
homeowners exemption accorded land dwellers. It was only in 1981 that the 
Internal Revenue Service finally decided that a boat, if used as a dwelling, 
qualifies as a replacement residence to offset real estate capital gains 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
The same myopia seems to apply throughout the liveaboard's economic life. Some 
banks hesitate to issue boat loans if the boat is to be lived aboard, for 
example. Dollar for dollar, loan interest rates are generally higher for boats 
than for houses. Insurance costs are more, too. ("Houses can catch on fire," an 
insurance broker friend reminds me, "but boats can catch on fire and sink.") 
</P>
<P>
Even more alarming to the prospective liveaboard is the impact on his legal 
rights. If he chooses to live afloat rather than ashore, for example, he must 
in effect surrender his constitutional protection against the warrantless 
search and seizure of his home guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. Once a boat 
is placed on a public waterway (as most are) it can be legally boarded without 
a warrant any time of the day or night by federal authorities (usually the 
Coast Guard) even if it is being used full-time as a home. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the San Diego Log waterfront newspaper has been filled with 
horror stories of liveaboard boat owners being aroused in the wee hours by 
uniformed feds and having their vessels boarded and searched. Sometimes, the 
stated purpose is a serious one, such as suspected drugs. But, occasionally, 
it's nothing more than a routine check of required safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But to many liveaboards I know, the unkindest cut of all comes not from 
officialdom but from their land-bound neighbors who don't understand -- or who 
simply cannot accept -- their unconventional life style. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same feeling of resentment that was directed against the "hippie" 
longhairs in their communes of the '60s, youngsters who were simply marching to 
a different drummer and whose "aberration" we accept today. "If you live on a 
small, nondescript boat and anchor free in the bay, you're accused of being a 
'squatter' or a 'freeloader,' " a liveaboard friend explains in exasperation. 
"And, if you're living on a million-dollar yacht, you've got jealousy to worry 
about. Either way, you can't win." As one result, many coastal cities have 
banned boat living altogether. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows this better than the Mud Ducks of Emory Cove. For about two years 
now, they have been waging a losing legal battle against the San Diego Unified 
Port District for the right to remain anchored where they are. The Port 
District has declared the anchorage illegal and wants to move the liveaboards 
to another anchorage in San Diego Bay, one that the Mud Ducks contend is 
unsafe. Harbor police cited several of the liveaboards and a local court found 
them guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Pending appeal, however (a process that could take months or even years) the 
embattled Mud Ducks have refused to budge. That fact has not been lost on 
planners of a multimillion-dollar resort hotel whose rooms will directly face 
the cluster of derelict craft of which most of the Emory Cove community 
admittedly consists. 
</P>
<P>
The Mud Ducks' legal case is a tenuous one. Their attorney argues that the 
federal government, not the Port District, has administrative jurisdiction over 
San Diego Bay, and that Uncle Sam has permitted anchoring and living aboard 
almost since the turn of the century. I wouldn't bet much money on a favorable 
outcome of that appeal. 
</P>
<P>
But, legal semantics aside, it is not the Battle of Emory Cove alone that seems 
to matter here. It is the fact that it is increasingly symptomatic of 
legislative, economic and public pressures against those who pursue an 
unconventional life style all along our coasts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the longhairs of the '60s, all the Mud Ducks plead is to be left alone, to 
march to that different drummer. Is that too much to ask?

DITCHING THE BORDER DITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is the U.S. government going to dig a ditch to protect us from the waves of 
immigrants washing across our southern border? What will this really solve? 
</P>
<P>
While it is clear that the Otay Mesa area is experiencing the stress of a large 
influx of migrants, building a ditch will only drain the community's pasture 
lands, not stay this insurgent tide. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of immigrants come to the United States because of their 
experience of poverty and war. Until this bitter reality is removed, the flood 
across our borders will only pour in at another point. 
</P>
<P>
The United States could help the reality of poverty in Mexico, Central, and 
South America by assisting these countries to develop job opportunities within 
their own borders. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of U. S. assistance should be to bring about economic self-sufficiency. 
The ultimate goal should be to improve the quality of life for people whose 
only crime in coming to the United States is wanting to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Further, U. S. assistance to these nations should be based upon the clear 
understanding that those nations that receive such aid operate in the 
democratic tradition which allows free elections and does not subject its own 
citizens to torture and government by terror. 
</P>
<P>
Such policies, though slower and more difficult to implement, will have far 
more effectiveness in the long run to stay the tide of illegal immigration than 
the rather simplistic solution of digging a ditch.

POLICE RIGHTS OVERSHADOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Grand Jury recently issued a glowing report on the San 
Diego Police Department's firearms policies and its procedures for 
investigating shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"Senior leadership of the Police Department is dedicated to enforcement of 
excellent policies," said the grand jury, which reviewed 18 shooting deaths 
that occurred over 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The report also concluded that officers are thoroughly trained and that they 
strive to carry out the policies. Both the Police Department and the district 
attorney's office were praised for thoroughly investigating each shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The report made the Police Department sound almost superhuman. But the report 
may have particular credibility because this was the same grand jury that 
sharply criticized the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the contrast made the San Diego Police Department look better than it 
is. Or, perhaps the San Diego Police Department's handling of discipline is 
truly exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first civilian review board seemed to think so. It agreed with the 
disposition of all of the complaints it reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
But the public has no way of judging. Under the current interpretation of the 
state's police officer's "bill of rights," no information whatsoever is 
released about complaints against officers -- not even anonymous statistical 
summaries, and not even to the person making the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing individual officers' rights against the public's rights is difficult, 
and, in striving to strike such a balance, some confidentiality of personnel 
matters is reasonable. But the protection allowed under current state law is 
not. The public is left in the dark unless the case is reviewed by the district 
attorney or an officer appeals a disciplinary decision to the Civil Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A bill by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) would restore some of the 
public's rights. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow information on the type, number and disposition of 
complaints to be released if it did not identify individual officers. It would 
also allow complainants to be told of the disposition of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The state police chiefs' association supports the bill, as do the city of San 
Diego and Police Chief Bob Burgreen. Support among officers' organizations is 
spotty. San Diego's Police Officers Assn. supports the release of statistical 
information, but objects to complainants being told of the disposition, because 
they know the identity of the officer and might make the information public. 
</P>
<P>
The concern of officers about this is understandable; for most people, 
personnel matters are confidential. But police officers are not most people. 
They serve the public and are granted the legal right to use lethal force. And, 
if a complaint procedure is to be meaningful, the complainant has to be told 
the disposition of his complaint. 
</P>
<P>
We urge support for Sher's bill. Making such information public is crucial if 
police departments are to be held accountable for their actions. Without such 
information, no civilian review, whether by the grand jury or the new civilian 
review panel, which was overwhelmingly approved by the voters, can be very 
effective.

ACCESS TO ADULT CABLE TV FARE TOO EASY, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Jones said she was incensed when Paragon Communications, which provides 
cable service in five South Bay cities, sent her an April movie listing that 
included instructions on accessing an adult entertainment channel. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a longtime Torrance resident, said she is not against adult 
entertainment but is concerned that the instructions will make it easy for 
children to dial up the service. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody blew it as far as I'm concerned," she said. "I just think it was a 
totally irresponsible act on their part and I hope they don't do it again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Mayors Wrote to Paragon 
</P>
<P>
Jones and officials from several cities, along with clergy and other residents, 
are upset about the Tuxxedo Network, an adult entertainment channel Paragon 
began offering in January. They say that it is too easy for children to gain 
access to the channel and that watching it is harmful to them. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors of four of the five cities Paragon serves in the South Bay -- 
Torrance, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Gardena -- wrote Paragon earlier this year to 
express that concern. 
</P>
<P>
However, Paragon officials say they offer an adequate system to keep children 
from viewing the adult movies. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said the previous cable company, Group W, had 
agreed not to offer adult channels. Although Paragon is not obligated by that 
agreement, Geissert said Thursday that she is upset that Paragon is offering 
the Tuxxedo Network. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse said she wrote a letter after several residents 
complained to her about the channel. Kruse said she is concerned that the 
service is too easy to access. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it needs better restrictions," she said. "It leaves too much wide 
open." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discontinuation Asked 
</P>
<P>
Gary Leary, pastor at the Foursquare Church on Del Amo Boulevard in Torrance, 
takes a stronger stand. He wrote Paragon in January asking that the service be 
discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
The channel "puts women in a bad light, fosters the dehumanization of women and 
in particular doesn't show godly love," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon Vice President Mark Mangiola defended the cable company's programming, 
adding that he understands how some people can be upset about the adult 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
"I can appreciate the fact that some people don't want this in their house," 
Mangiola said. But he added that no subscribers have complained or threatened 
to discontinue their cable subscription. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate weight is with the consumer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon, which took over cable services from Group W Cable Inc. in 1987, serves 
about 54,000 households in Torrance, El Segundo, Gardena, Lawndale and 
Hawthorne. Movies on the Tuxxedo Network can be ordered on a daily basis. About 
3,000 households order the Tuxxedo Network on a regular basis, Mangiola said. 
</P>
<P>
Mangiola said the mailer Jones complained about should have included 
information about security devices to keep children from watching the adult 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precautions for Parents 
</P>
<P>
He said the cable company's handbook explains that parents can keep children 
from accessing the channel by putting a lock on their cable converter boxes or 
by requiring a password to gain access to the station. 
</P>
<P>
Without these precautions, the Tuxxedo Network can be switched on by calling 
Paragon and dialing a 10-digit account number on a touch-tone telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Carter, cable administrator for Torrance, said the access system used by 
Paragon is similar to those used by most cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
Carter added that Torrance has no power to regulate Paragon's programing. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he knows of only one other case -- in Tennessee -- in which 
residents complained about ease of access to adult cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petitions Sent to Churchgoers 
</P>
<P>
George Johnson, pastor of the Foursquare Church on Prairie Avenue in Torrance, 
said children are smart enough to figure out how to access the channel. "When 
kids are able to deal drugs at 9 or 10 years old, they can get into this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Leary said he sent a petition to members of Foursquare churches throughout the 
South Bay asking them to oppose the Tuxxedo Network. 
</P>
<P>
Mangiola said he has received no such petition. 
</P>
<P>
Mangiola said the movies shown on the Tuxxedo Network are rated R and are "not 
nearly as explicit as the movies you can rent at the video store." 
</P>
<P>
Among the titles offered this month on the Tuxxedo Network are "Too Naughty to 
Say No," "Young Nurses in Lust" and "Tropic of Desire." 
</P>
<P>
Mangiola said that even if Group W had agreed not to offer adult movies, 
Paragon's franchise agreements contain no such restriction. 
</P>
<P>
"We are abiding by the contract we signed," Mangiola said.

LAWNDALE DELAYS DECISION ON CITY HALL LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jobs of six Lawndale city employees are on the line this week as the City 
Council attempts to cut $418,592 from the 1989-90 budget to hire additional law 
enforcement workers to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Larry Rudolph and Harold E. Hofmann pressed for a council vote on 
the layoffs Thursday night, but Mayor Sarann Kruse was able to muster three 
votes to postpone a decision until the council meets in budget workshops this 
week. Sessions are scheduled at 7 p.m. Monday and Thursday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse said Friday that layoffs should be considered only as a last resort. "You 
just don't cut jobs until you have tried everything else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Voting with Kruse were Councilwoman Carol Norman, who works for the city of 
Hawthorne and is generally supportive of Lawndale's city staff, and Councilman 
Dan McKenzie, a retired pipe fitter and union negotiator who sometimes is 
critical of the staff. He said jobs should be the last thing to go in budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents and city employees attended the emotional 5 1/2-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare appearance before the council, elected City Clerk Neil K. Roth 
challenged the proposed staff cuts, asking whether spending an additional 
$400,000 more a year would make the city a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plea Against Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't think the city of Lawndale was safe today, I'd be looking for 
another place to live," he said. 
</P>
<P>
James Belmore of the Lawndale Professional Mid-Management Employees Assn. 
pleaded with the council not to impose the layoffs. "If you go to the grocery 
store and you don't have enough money for all the things you want to buy, you 
don't go home and kill the kids," he said, adding that city workers with as 
much as 17 years' experience should be treated with "respect and 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said Friday he was disappointed that the decision was put off. "If we 
want to stick to what we said about hiring more deputies, we are going to have 
to make some hard-core cuts," he said. "Nobody really wants to have to do it, 
but the longer you wait the harder it gets." 
</P>
<P>
The council on May 4 voted 4-1, with Norman dissenting, to ask for a staff 
analysis of what cuts could be made in the $7.8 million 1989-90 budget to 
contract for additional services from the Sheriff's Department, which patrols 
Lawndale under contract with the city. It would cost $418,592 in the fiscal 
year starting July to add two one-man patrol cars and two civilian workers, who 
would take crime reports and perform other tasks to free uniformed officers for 
crime control. The proposed budget includes $1.9 million to maintain the 
current level of sheriff's services. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kruse had presented a less costly plan that would provide six or 
eight more civilian workers, instead of the two additional deputies and two 
civilian workers. The Sheriff's Department is evaluating that plan, including 
the amount of savings. 
</P>
<P>
But Kruse's plan faces opposition from Rudolph, who said Friday he believes 
gun-carrying, uniformed officers are needed to deal with Lawndale's crime and 
gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale residents and businessmen have been complaining to the council about a 
recent increase in graffiti, which indicates gang activity is on the upswing in 
Lawndale, according to Sheriff's Capt. Walt Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
He said in a recent interview that Lawndale's problem is not as serious as in 
East Los Angeles or South-Central Los Angeles, but said action now could 
prevent gangs from becoming entrenched in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
A contingent of city employees, including most of those whose jobs are in 
jeopardy, were in the audience Thursday as the council debated the layoffs. The 
heated discussion went on for about an hour, with residents speaking on both 
sides. Then, the council voted 3-2 to delay the decision until this week. Later 
in the night, the council members returned to discuss Kruse's less costly 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Layoff Targets 
</P>
<P>
The targeted employees are administrative analysts Marsha Schutte and 
Grace-Marie Johnston, both 12-year employees; community safety officer Paul 
Jordan, 17 years; community information officer Ken Huthmaker, eight years; 
assistant planner Lola Unger, about two years, and one of the two 
administrative assistants in the community development department, Valerie 
Armstrong or Vivian Smith. Armstrong reportedly has quit already. The city, 
with a population of about 26,000, has just under 60 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents and businessmen urged the council to make whatever staff cuts 
are necessary to beef up the city's police protection. Jonathan Stein, a local 
developer, said that a number of employees at City Hall perform "peripheral" 
functions that could be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we owe a livelihood to these people at the expense of the whole town? I 
think not," Stein said. "If we don't have safety in Lawndale, you don't have 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Several Lawndale residents, including activists Nancy Marthens and Steve Mino, 
said they do not want more deputies to be hired at the expense of city workers. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Sturgeon, saying she was one of those who appealed for more deputies at a 
meeting a few weeks ago, asked the council not to impose layoffs but cut 
programs, as recommended by Assistant City Manager Paula J. Cone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reserve Fund 
</P>
<P>
Cone reported that, by making program cuts and using its expected $200,000 
reserve, the city could without any layoffs, come up with all but about $32,000 
of the $418,592. 
</P>
<P>
But Acting City Manager Jim Arnold, in a subsequent report recommending the six 
layoffs, said it would be "completely unsound fiscally" to leave the city 
without a reserve fund. "I have no choice other than to recommend to the City 
Council specific program and personnel cuts to accomplish the council mandate 
of increased law enforcement services." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordeal of Public Debate 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Kruse was critical of Arnold for making public his 
layoff recommendation. He should have given the council a confidential memo 
rather than put the six staff members through the ordeal of a public debate on 
their jobs Thursday night, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Arnold said he is only following the direction the 
council has given. "I'm cast as the big villain, but I'm not the one that voted 
$419,000 for more cops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse said the proposed cuts have been devastating to an already short-staffed 
and overworked city staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 1/2-Hour Closed Session 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised more people haven't walked out the door," she said. "You're 
going to see a very big turnover at City Hall. Those people are going to leave, 
and I think we are going to be hard-pressed to replace them. People are going 
to be very leery about coming to work for Lawndale." 
</P>
<P>
After midnight, the council went into a 2 1/2-hour closed session, where it 
discussed problems in the Planning Department that had been the subject of an 
emergency meeting Tuesday. Hofmann, Rudolph and McKenzie have charged that 
planning staff is doing a poor job and has issued building permits for projects 
that do not meet city codes. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's meeting, Rudolph said: "We should fire the whole Planning 
Department."

CAR-POOL LANE WON'T HARM ENVIRONMENT, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans has concluded in a new report that a $44.6-million project to add an 
exclusive car-pool lane on the San Diego Freeway between the Harbor and Marina 
freeways will not have a significant impact on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-page environmental assessment does not examine the potential impact on 
motorists while the project is under way, but state transportation officials 
concede that putting a car-pool lane in the middle of one of the nation's 
busiest freeways poses a major challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not without difficulty," said Dave Roper, Caltrans deputy district 
director for operations. "We're going to have to come up with some way to keep 
the traffic moving." 
</P>
<P>
The work will have to be done at night and on weekends to minimize potential 
traffic disruptions, Roper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project to Begin in 1990 
</P>
<P>
The project calls for squeezing the car-pool lane into the existing freeway by 
all but eliminating the shoulder in the median and narrowing the present 
traffic lanes to less than the standard for interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-mile-long project is scheduled to begin in 1990 and be completed in 
1994, if state and federal funding is available. Actual construction -- most of 
it in reconfiguring existing lanes -- will be done in stages and take two 
years. The delay in completing the project stems from a shortage of state 
gas-tax revenues, which cannot pay for all the road projects now scheduled, 
said state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Roper said that before the work begins, Caltrans will develop a separate 
traffic management plan that may include restriping adjacent surface streets, 
installing automated traffic signals, and restricting parking in an effort to 
relieve freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"We will design and carry out the job with the idea that during the heavy 
traffic hours we will not be closing lanes," he said. "The movement of traffic 
is of prime importance to us." 
</P>
<P>
The environmental assessment prepared by the California Department of 
Transportation indicates that the car-pool lane by itself will not have a 
significant environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no significant change in air quality, water quality, noise levels 
or energy use when the project is completed, and no effect is expected on 
businesses, residences or schools. 
</P>
<P>
The route passes through parts of the city of Los Angeles, Culver City, 
Inglewood, Hawthorne, Redondo Beach, Lawndale, Torrance and unincorporated 
parts of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental assessment notes that the San Diego Freeway from the Marina 
Freeway to the Harbor Freeway suffers from heavy congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate 405 at the Marina Freeway, north of Los Angeles International 
Airport, is one of the most heavily traveled freeways in the country, carrying 
an average of 224,000 vehicles a day in 1987. At the interchange with the 
Harbor Freeway, the San Diego Freeway carried an average of 191,000 vehicles a 
day in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The congestion is not isolated to the peak periods alone, but is recurrent for 
most hours of the day during weekdays and is present for significant periods of 
the day on weekends," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on projected growth in population, the number of housing units and jobs 
in West Los Angeles, the South Bay and Long Beach areas, Caltrans expects the 
freeway -- without any improvements -- will be operating at stop-and-go 
conditions at least three hours a day in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans said 21% of the vehicles using the freeway are carrying two or more 
occupants, but they share the same traffic lanes with other motorists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3,500 People Per Hour 
</P>
<P>
The car-pool lane would allow the freeway to carry an additional 3,500 people 
per hour by giving those vehicles an exclusive lane, according to the 
environmental document. Caltrans projections for 2010 show that up to 308,000 
vehicles daily will be using the San Diego Freeway at the Marina Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"You are adding capacity to that freeway and it desperately needs capacity," 
Roper said. "It provides an incentive to shift into ride-sharing." There is no 
discussion in the assessment of the potential impact on traffic while the work 
is being done. But Roper said that issue "will receive a great deal of special 
attention" when the traffic management plan is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The car-pool lane is part of an ambitious plan to build a so-called 
high-occupancy vehicle lane along the 405 from the Marina Freeway in Los 
Angeles County to the junction of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in 
Orange County, a distance of 50 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The project is being built in stages. A five-mile portion of the car-pool lane 
in Orange County opened to traffic early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The segment from the Harbor Freeway to the Marina Freeway is a top priority of 
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
But state and federal funding for the project is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year state transportation improvement program to be adopted June 29 by 
the California Transportation Commission includes $12.8 million for preliminary 
work -- primarily design -- of the car-pool lane during the 1990-91 fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $31.8 million for the car-pool project is not scheduled until the 
1993-94 fiscal year because of a shortage of gas-tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't enough money to build it all at once," said Caltrans spokesman Jim 
Drago in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Drago said there is a possibility that the project schedule will slip further. 
"There is an identified need for additional revenue," he said. If a 
transportation financing package, which is being discussed in Sacramento, wins 
legislative approval and voters endorse the gas-tax increase that is the 
centerpiece of the plan, the prospects for finishing the project before 1994 
"look a lot better," Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restriping the Freeway 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the car-pool lane from the Marina Freeway to the Los 
Angeles-Orange County line -- 26 miles -- is expected to exceed $120 million. 
The price tag for the Orange County car-pool lane is expected to reach $56 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Orange County work, which involves construction of an entirely 
separate lane in the middle of the freeway, much of the project in the South 
Bay and on the Westside will involve merely restriping the existing freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The present 12-foot-wide traffic lanes, the standard for interstate highways, 
would be narrowed to 11 feet. Nearly all of the existing shoulder in the median 
will be converted to the car-pool lane, which will be separated from other 
traffic by a 1-foot-wide buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the narrow lanes and absence of a shoulder in the median of the 
freeway, Ginger Gherardi, manager of highways for the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission, said the project does not pose safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider it to be unsafe in any way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Santa Monica Freeway already has been restriped to reduce the width 
of traffic lanes to 10.5 or 11 feet. Roper said the narrower lanes have been 
"no cause for heartburn." 
</P>
<P>
However, Roper said, there is "no question that congestion and accidents go 
hand-in-hand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peak Commute Hours 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans statistics show that there is a high percentage of rear-end and 
side-swipe accidents on the freeway, many involving stopped or slow-moving 
vehicles. About 40% of all accidents occur during the peak commute hours. 
</P>
<P>
He said any reduction in congestion should result in fewer accidents and that 
should more than offset the loss of the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Roper said the project plans also call for construction of three enforcement 
areas in the median of the freeway, giving the Highway Patrol space to pull 
over and ticket lone motorists illegally using the car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
The project so far has generated little public comment and no public hearing 
has been scheduled, said Caltrans. The deadline for public comment on the 
environmental assessment is June 26. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the document are available at planning departments in Los Angeles, 
Culver City, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Lawndale and Redondo Beach and at several 
public libraries. For more information, contact Caltrans at 620-3755.

AFTER TWO YEARS IN COURTS, INGLEWOOD COUNCIL RACE WILL BE SETTLED AT POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1987 Inglewood City Council race will be decided at the polls by 
mid-October, as Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas and Garland Hardeman face off 
again to settle an election that was first annulled, then fought over all the 
way to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The final judicial act in the case came May 24 when the state Supreme Court 
denied appeals filed by Thomas, the city and Hardeman and upheld the Superior 
Court decision that annulled Thomas' victory and ordered the June, 1987, 
election rerun. 
</P>
<P>
The city must hold the runoff election within 120 days after receiving official 
notification from the courts, said City Atty. Howard Rosten. The city has yet 
to receive word from the Superior Court, which has jurisdiction over the case. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has held onto his 4th District seat since the disputed election, while 
Hardeman, a Los Angeles police officer who accused Thomas supporters of illegal 
tactics at the polls, had urged the court to name him the winner. 
</P>
<P>
The court case moved beyond one man's campaign to erase an election defeat and 
became a lingering political issue and a debate on the judiciary's role in 
mediating election disputes. The Supreme Court ruling is seen as a blow to 
Mayor Edward Vincent, a Thomas ally who was criticized by the Superior Court in 
1987 for his involvement in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman's attorney, Mark Borenstein, declared victory Friday for Hardeman and 
the voters and called for the runoff election to be held as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"A bad election was discovered to be bad," said Borenstein. "This is not a case 
where there were minor irregularities. This is an election that was filled with 
fraud, misrepresentation and intimidation. This went to the heart of whether 
the will of the people . . . actually determines the winner." 
</P>
<P>
But those representing the city argued Friday that interference by the courts 
in the election will encourage other losers to take disputes to the courtroom 
that should be handled at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any doubt that every election since George Washington has had some 
irregularities," said Rosten. "I'm positive of that. But are those 
irregularities so egregious that the courts should get involved?" 
</P>
<P>
Appellate specialist Edward Lascher, hired by the city, added: "The California 
Supreme Court can hear only a microscopic proportion of the cases brought 
before it. I'm disappointed but not surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Neither candidate could be reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began when Hardeman objected to Thomas' 16-vote election victory. 
He sued, and the Superior Court invalidated 31 votes, implicating Vincent and 
other Thomas supporters in Election Code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Leon Savitch found that voters had been intimidated and 
that their right to ballot secrecy had been violated. The judge also said 
numerous ballots were illegally hand-delivered to the city clerk's office. In 
two cases, voters told the court that Vincent punched their ballots for them. 
Vincent has repeatedly denied that he violated election procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Although the judge called for a new election, Thomas remained in office through 
the appeals. Hardeman, who repeatedly called for Thomas' resignation, attended 
council meetings and voted unofficially on city business. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is still investigating 
possible Election Code violations in the election. In addition, the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission says it is looking into allegations that Vincent 
and Thomas failed to properly report Vincent's contributions of money and 
resources to the Thomas campaign.

POPULAR CAL STATE LONG BEACH PRESIDENT FACES TOUGH BUDGET TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Curtis L. McCray took over as president of Cal State Long Beach last 
summer, some administrators and faculty members thought he was too good to be 
true. 
</P>
<P>
He promised an open-door policy, then kept his word. He converted the lavish 
office of his predecessor into a conference area and moved into a modest room 
equipped with a personal computer, a telephone and a desk adorned with 
seashells. 
</P>
<P>
Following a tradition dating from the early years of his administrative career, 
he began teaching a class on Chaucer. And he still spends occasional half-days 
working alternately as a campus secretary, custodian, groundskeeper and 
admissions clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"The president has to be seen," said McCray, 51. "The point is to speak to 
people one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
Now 10 months later, the new president, with some notable exceptions, is still 
getting generally high marks on his performance. Praised for the energy and 
sense of inclusiveness he has brought to the campus, McCray is seen by the 
faculty, at least, as a breath of fresh air compared to his predecessor, 
Stephen Horn, with whom its relations were often strained. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a one-man show under Horn," said Bob Winchell, president of the 
1,900-member university faculty union. In contrast, Winchell said, McCray 
listens to faculty members and includes them in the decision-making process. 
"It's a multi-university show under McCray," he said. "He's brought a spirit of 
true collegiality to the campus." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the president remains largely untried, both his admirers and detractors 
agree. Although he has moved to streamline his administration by announcing a 
top-level reorganization effective July 1, they say McCray has not yet faced 
the hard decisions that can make or break a presidency. 
</P>
<P>
That is about to change. 
</P>
<P>
Having completed his first academic year at Cal State Long Beach, McCray now 
faces a budget crunch of potentially dramatic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"The honeymoon is over," said one program administrator who asked not to be 
named. "Now he's going to have to make some real tough decisions. I'm afraid of 
things falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
The president already has taken the unusual step of requesting permission from 
the state chancellor's office to turn away as many as 3,000 qualified students 
for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The looming crisis is attributed to a number of factors. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Cal State Long Beach has been underfunded compared to other 
campuses in the California State University and Colleges system, McCray said. 
While the average campus received $5,376 per full-time student last year, the 
Long Beach campus received only $4,583 -- about 85% of the average. The same 
general pattern, McCray said, has existed for years. 
</P>
<P>
He said state funding formulas are outdated, assuming that large campuses can 
educate students more cheaply than smaller campuses. Thus, large Cal State 
campuses, such as Long Beach, San Diego and Northridge, receive considerably 
less per student than do smaller campuses such as Stanislaus, Bakersfield and 
Humboldt. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, McCray said, the financial problem has been compounded by 
rapidly growing enrollment that has consistently exceeded expectations. The 
university is required by law to accept all students who qualify for admission, 
McCray said. When the university accepts more than the number of students 
budgeted, it effectively receives a lower allocation per student, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of $3 Million 
</P>
<P>
The university's financial resources also would be affected by Gov. George 
Deukmejian's proposed fiscal 1989-90 budget that, among other things, would 
reduce the state university system's funding by about $45 million. The Long 
Beach campus alone would lose $3 million next year under the governor's plan, 
McCray said. The university's budget this year totals $136.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
University officials have expressed hope, however, that an unexpected budget 
surplus may help alleviate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
McCray says he plans to tackle the problem on several fronts. First, he said, 
he has asked Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who heads the state university system, 
to review what he considers archaic formulas by which the state determines how 
money is distributed among the system's 19 campuses. Funding is based on a 
complicated set of factors including the mix and variety of programs, type of 
faculty and environmental setting of a campus, McCray said, and the formulas 
have not been examined in a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
He also has asked Reynolds to declare Cal State Long Beach "impacted" -- a 
legal maneuver that would allow the campus to turn away as many as 3,000 
otherwise qualified applicants for fall admission. Thus, McCray said, the 
university could limit total enrollment to about 23,600, the level for which he 
expects to receive funding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ticklish situation," the president said. Rather than sacrifice quality 
in favor of expedience, he said, the university ought to stop trying to do a 
job it is not being adequately funded to do and hope the resulting furor will 
send a message to the state capital. "The pain is created by public policy," he 
said. "What we have to do is begin inflicting the pain on the public-policy 
makers, and the way we do that is by not accommodating students." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach's anticipated $3-million decrease in the state allocation, 
he said, presents a challenge; one that is bound to draw blood. To meet the 
governor's proposed bare-bones budget, McCray said, he is considering major 
cuts in three areas: athletics, the University Art Museum and KLON, a 
jazz-oriented public radio station associated with the university. 
</P>
<P>
In May, McCray said, he asked the heads of those programs to examine how they 
could operate on about three-fifths of their current budgets. Other options 
under consideration, he said, include eliminating the programs entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Already the mere specter of such solutions has led to a flurry of angry 
petitions and phone calls, McCray said. And even if the proposed cuts are 
carried out, he said, they would make only a dent in the problem. A remaining 
shortfall of about $2.1 million would have to be eliminated by a hiring freeze 
and reductions in such academic support items as new library books, travel, 
paper or laboratory supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are upset," McCray said. "The difficulty is that none of the 
letters have suggested (alternative) ways of finding funding." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the impending cuts -- which McCray says probably will be finalized this 
month -- do not seem to have seriously tarnished the new president's image. Of 
more concern on campus, it seems, are the implications of his planned 
administrative reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, according to McCray, the number of administrators reporting 
directly to the president will be reduced from about 12 to 4. A new provost 
position will be created. It will be filled by John Beljan, vice president for 
academic affairs, who will be second-in-command to McCray. 
</P>
<P>
A vice president for administration and finance will assume responsibility for 
budgeting. William Griffith, a former accountant who was business manager 11 
years at Northeastern Illinois University, has been selected. 
</P>
<P>
The other two officers reporting directly to the president will be Robert 
Bersi, vice president for development, and June Cooper, who will become vice 
president for student services. She now is vice president for faculty and staff 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The announced changes have created concern in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
One lower-level administrator expressed discomfort at the prospect of Griffith, 
a new force on campus with whom few are familiar, exerting such major control 
over the university's purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
And student leaders say they are wary of Cooper's ability to oversee student 
services -- which include counseling, student activities, housing and food 
services -- after spending so many years representing the interests of faculty 
and staff. That wariness has been increased, they say, by recent perceptions 
that McCray has been less than hospitable to student input and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"When there are valid student issues that need to be brought up, they are put 
off," said Roger Thompson, who has been Associated Student Body president since 
last summer. After meeting regularly with student leaders during his first 
semester on campus, Thompson said, McCray has recently become so difficult to 
get an appointment with that Thompson has been unable to see him in two months. 
"The perception," Thompson said, "is that we aren't getting his ear." 
</P>
<P>
McCray blames Thompson's recent inability to see him on miscommunication, and 
says he is "stunned" by the student leader's perception that students are 
ignored. McCray says one of his major goals is to foster good communications 
with all sectors of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
He recently initiated a special program under which a major campus walkway is 
named after an outstanding staff member each month. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent luncheon with about 10 new teachers over a relaxed meal of 
vegetables and spinach crepes, McCray casually discussed issues ranging from 
the anticipated budget crunch to his ideas on recruiting minority students. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is very valuable," said Everett Murdock, a computer education 
professor. "There's contact made. What he's doing is establishing 
communications for the future and it's fostered a good climate." 
</P>
<P>
McCray's schedule for the rest of the day, which he described as typical, 
included teaching his Chaucer class, meeting with faculty union president 
Winchell, attending a meeting of Boy Scout leaders to discuss the coming 
Scout-O-Rama of which he is chairman, and meeting with soon-to-be student 
services czar Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
McCray generally begins his days with an early morning jog near his home and 
ends them at one of the numerous social or cultural gatherings he is often 
called upon to attend. Unlike Horn, who traveled a great deal, McCray says he 
prefers to stay close to home and involve himself in local activities. 
</P>
<P>
His energy and enthusiasm, in fact, has been noticed by Chancellor Reynolds, 
who in the past has often been unwilling to comment publicly on the 
professional performances of campus presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely delighted with his administration," Reynolds said in a 
telephone interview. "He's proved to be a very caring manager of the campus and 
he's a pleasure to work with. We work very well shoulder-to-shoulder. He has 
not made a misstep in my opinion, and that's very unusual on a campus of this 
size and complexity."

SUPERVISORS OK $2.3 MILLION FOR AIDS HOSPICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has committed another $2.38 million over three 
years to AIDS hospices, voting to support new shelters in Pomona and 
Willowbrook and to back existing ones in Van Nuys and central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors withheld long-term support, however, from the hospice that 
serves the coastal area. 
</P>
<P>
The new three-year commitments, approved last week amid complaints that the 
county's AIDS program is moving too slowly, extend hospice funding to mid-1992. 
The action comes close to fulfilling pledges by the supervisors a year ago to 
spend $2 million annually on shelters for patients with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beds Increased by 16 
</P>
<P>
The funding package increases the number of county-supported hospice beds from 
21 to 37 at a cost of about $50,000 each per year, or $1.85 million for 37. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are about 100 beds in AIDS hospices countywide, most of them paid 
for by private contributions or the patients themselves. About 6,900 AIDS cases 
have been confirmed in the county, including almost 4,500 that ended in death, 
since the county began keeping statistics on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
While increasing its support last week, the board extended for only two months 
its contract with the Padua House hospice in downtown Long Beach. It also 
withdrew funding from Hughes House in the West Hollywood area, which ran out of 
money and closed recently. 
</P>
<P>
Though both facilities are run by the same organization, the county withheld 
long-term support for different reasons, said John Schunhoff, assistant 
director of the County AIDS Office. 
</P>
<P>
A management shake-up at Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach has left in doubt who 
holds the lease for the Padua House, so that contract will not be renewed, 
Schunhoff said. Under a formula that sets aside eight hospice beds -- or 
$400,000 a year -- for each of five supervisorial districts, the Padua House is 
now receiving the full eight-bed allotment for the 4th District, a coastal 
strip between Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Its Contract 
</P>
<P>
Hospices will be asked to bid for the 4th District funds in June, Schunhoff 
said. County payments should begin a month or two after that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes House lost its $100,000-a-year contract because the county chose to 
award the full $400,000 allocation for the 3rd District to a 25-bed regional 
facility at Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park. However, the Hughes House is in 
line for state funds and could reopen as a shelter for AIDS patients who are 
not near death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists, while pleased with increased hospice funding from the county, 
cite the withdrawal of support for Hughes House as an example of the 
shortcomings of the county's policy of district-by-district allocations. They 
say it does not take into account the concentration of most AIDS cases in a few 
areas, especially West Hollywood and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
John Maceri, president of Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach, and others have asked 
that hospice money set aside for one district but not spent, be placed in a 
pool to provide care in other districts where hospice beds already exist. 
</P>
<P>
That point was made by members of the county AIDS Commission when it asked 
Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon to find out how much hospice money 
in this year's budget has not been spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the (political) reason for the distribution," Maceri said. "The 
problem is . . . that Supervisor (Ed) Edelman's district has the highest 
concentration of cases in the county, but he has the same amount of money that 
(Supervisor) Pete Schabarum has." 
</P>
<P>
Schunhoff said -- counting last week's allocations -- $1.1 million of the 
$2-million hospice budget will have been spent for beds when the 1988-89 fiscal 
year ends June 30. Another $550,000 is being spent for other AIDS services, 
such as setting up an AIDS ward at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center and 
providing anti-AIDS drugs to area clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
About $350,000, or 18% of the $2 million, will not be spent this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this delay has to do with getting new programs up and running," 
Schunhoff said. "There has to be a lead time." 
</P>
<P>
Schunhoff also said Schabarum has responded to the uneven distribution of AIDS 
cases by allowing money for six of the eight beds for his San Gabriel Valley 
district to be spent at a hospice in central Los Angeles. Patients treated 
there must be from Schabarum's district, however, Schunhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts awarded last week, the three organizations that will 
receive funding through June, 1992 are: 
</P>
<P>
* Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach. It will get about $94,000 a year for two beds 
at a shelter being set up in Pomona and about $235,000 a year for five beds at 
Pioneer House in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
* Serra Ancillary Care Corp. It will get about $271,000 a year for six beds at 
an existing facility west of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* AIDS Hospice Foundation. The agency, which also operates the Barlow Hospital 
hospice, will get about $158,000 a year for three beds in a new shelter near 
Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook, north of Compton.

MEETING ON PENINSULA WILDLIFE SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A public meeting on wildlife preservation on the Palos Verdes Peninsula will be 
held at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the South Coast Botanic Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Results of a Rolling Hills survey on residents' knowledge of and attitudes 
about wildlife preservation will be announced at the meeting at 26300 Crenshaw 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The mail survey, which had a 40% response, was conducted by a Wildlife 
Preservation Committee appointed by the Rolling Hills City Council after some 
residents said increasing urbanization is driving away skunks, raccoons, foxes, 
opossums and other creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Don Gales, a naturalist and vice chairman of the committee, said that the 
meeting will also discuss ways to attract more animal and bird life and that 
committee plans to release pheasant and quail into the gated community.

SUMMER WORK AT DISNEYLAND HOLDS LITTLE MAGIC FOR YOUTH OF TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SECTER, Bob Secter is a Times staff writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the first thing that popped out of Orel Hershisher's mouth as he 
stepped off the mound after winning last year's World Series finale? It wasn't 
"We're No.1," or "I love the Dodgers" or "I love my family" or "Lasorda's a 
blimp" or even something as poignant as "Hi Mom." 
</P>
<P>
No, he walked straight up to a waiting cameraman and proudly announced to the 
universe that he was heading straight to Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics, of course, immediately suspected that the charming, boyish pitcher was 
being less than sincere. Some even suggested that he might actually have been 
paid to say such a thing, though the notion seems inconceivable because his 
annual salary surpasses the gross national product of several developing 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
But I can see how Hershisher, even at the very pinnacle of his baseball career, 
could be moved by such strange desires. Who among us is too old or too young or 
too rich or too poor or too blase to resist the lure of the Magic Kingdom, be 
it the copy in Florida or the real McCoy back here in Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
Kids in Orange County, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many years ago, the waiting list for a summer job at Disneyland was 
longer than the weekend lines at Space Mountain. Working at the park was 
considered almost a rite of passage for teen-agers around here. 
</P>
<P>
Now, according to the Disney folk, they're having trouble recruiting enough 
local high school and college talent to fill the 3,000 extra vacation season 
spots on the payroll. They may have to import youngsters from other states. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds Goofy, right? Here we are in one of the fastest growing, most affluent 
sections of the country, a place tailor-made for those who like to work hard 
and play hard, and local teens shun the chance to make a few bucks at the 
world's most famous amusement park, which also happens to be just down the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to come off like a shill for the Disney employment service. But 
we're talking about a phenomenon fraught with chilling sociological and 
cultural implications. 
</P>
<P>
In my neighborhood, back in the prehistoric days before rock videos and 
Nintendo, there was many a hot-blooded adolescent who would have gladly paid 
just to get the opportunity to sell tickets, fry burgers or sweep up in a place 
that had spawned the likes of an Annette or a Darlene. Talk about Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
But times have clearly changed. Youngsters today, already plotting to inherit 
the corporate suites, BMWs and country club memberships now held by their 
parents, are more interested in the bottom line. Disney teens earn only about 
$4.75 to $5 an hour, less than many can make at convenience shops, department 
stores and other challenging occupations. 
</P>
<P>
Long weekend hours are the norm and there's a strict dress code and grooming 
rules. Spiked hair or earrings on men are a definite no-no. What's more, 
everybody's expected to be polite and pleasant. In other words, as kids might 
so eloquently put it, it sounds like a real bummer, dude. 
</P>
<P>
"My students can get jobs that pay more money and have better hours," said one 
local high school employment counselor. " . . . A lot of kids don't want to cut 
their hair or get rid of the color they put in it." Laments park spokesman Bob 
Roth: "They want the hours to fit their schedules. There's a little more of an 
attitude that the 'job should be a convenience for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Disney people need to reach into their bag of creative tricks and 
inject a dose of relevancy into the old theme park to lure local youth back to 
the job. Nothing radical, mind you. Just a few subtle changes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Main Street U.S.A. could be revamped into Wall Street U.S.A., 
complete with a replica of the New York Stock Exchange. Lifelike robots of Ivan 
Boesky, Michael Milken and Carl Icahn could explain the mysteries of junk bonds 
and takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Matterhorn roller coaster could be reshaped into something resembling the 
Prudential Rock. Sleeping Beauty's palace could be subdivided, turned into 
condos or luxury sky boxes. And the rifles at the shooting galleries in 
Frontierland would become Uzis and Mac-10s. 
</P>
<P>
Sleepy, Grumpy and Dopey should be kept on, but they could be joined by a new, 
hipper ensemble of dwarfs with personas teens can identify with: Lazy, Sloppy, 
Shiftless and Prince. 
</P>
<P>
And that Mouse. Nuke him. If they must have an animal mascot, at least it 
should be one that symbolizes values held dear by today's adolescent crowd. 
Maybe Spuds McKenzie is available.

ROLE OF TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently I attended my eighth-grade daughter's Back-to-School Night at Sowers 
Middle School in Huntington Beach. As I shook each teacher's hand and said how 
much I appreciated her efforts, I began to realize how much I will miss these 
wonderful people. 
</P>
<P>
Through my daughter, I came to know her teachers so well. Mrs. Black shared her 
love of reading and writing. She gave me a child who is anxious to share 
another composition with positive comments and happy to read a book other than 
a Nancy Drew mystery. Mrs. Wolfe, a very aware woman, gave me a daughter that 
now races me to the first section of the newspaper each morning. Mrs. Hinds 
used her background as a math student to help my daughter realize that advanced 
math is indeed conquerable, even enjoyable. Mrs. Daly continued the science 
department's traditions of fostering excellence in girls as much as in boys. 
Mrs. Dominic shared her zeal for girls in sports and now we have a fine 
volleyball player to cheer. As an aide for Mrs. Hayes, this lovely lady helped 
my child realize that life is absolutely delightful. Each teacher routinely 
made my daughter feel good about herself. 
</P>
<P>
I like the stimulating young lady that these fine professionals send home to me 
each afternoon. Through my daughter, I continue to learn. Over the last three 
years, all her teachers have provided an environment and guidance that will 
afford my daughter a lifetime of success. What they have given my child is 
priceless.

HATE CRIMES DIRECTED AT HOMOSEXUALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In last Sunday's (May 28) Times, the prescient Commentary ("Why Hate Crimes 
Against Gays Should Be Everybody's Nightmare") provides a gratifying 
juxtaposition to a letter (on the opposite page) wherein one reads such -- 
among other -- inanities as "the opposite sex is terrifying as it is" and "only 
by keeping sexual perversities in the closet," etc. 
</P>
<P>
George Kennan, in his recent literary masterpiece, gives us an observation so 
pertinent as a perspective on such as the subject quotes -- "For one of the 
keys to the understanding of the human predicament is the recognition that 
there is, for the human individual, no reality -- no comprehensible and useful 
reality, at any rate -- other than that of an object as perceived by the human 
eye and the human mind. All that we see around us may be considered to some 
extent as a part of ourselves, the reflection of our own astigmatisms." 
</P>
<P>
The "perceptions" of the referenced letter writer must emanate from a seemingly 
deranged mind: pitiful.

INVENTIVE STUDENT MINDS, STRONG LEGS COMBINE IN UNENDING QUEST FOR 
HUMAN-POWERED FLIGHT

<P>
It was about 2 a.m. Saturday when eight UC Irvine engineering students 
converged on a campus athletic field to assemble the human-powered airplane 
they worked all year to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
By the light of fluorescent lamps powered through yards of orange extension 
cords, the students joined the tail boom to the fuselage, attached the 
propeller, assembled six wing sections and covered most of the aircraft with 
transparent Mylar. 
</P>
<P>
Before daybreak, there it was: Pegasus, its 100-foot-long single wing suspended 
like a giant white ruler against a backdrop of trees. And despite a soggy 
morning and a series of mechanical failures, the ungainly aircraft powered by a 
fast-pedaling cyclist actually got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear the wheels on the ground and then all of a sudden there's nothing 
between you and the ground," said team member Jeanne Pandes, 22, who piloted 
the plane on its first short flights. "You're cruising." 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is the third and most successful attempt by UC Irvine mechanical 
engineering students to construct a human-powered airplane as a senior project. 
The 1987 airplane, dubbed the UC Medfly, crashed almost immediately after 
leaving the ground. Last year's plane, UC-ME-FLY ("you see me fly"), succeeded 
in making flights of close to 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus team used wing sections from UC-ME-FLY, but built a new, more 
aerodynamic fuselage that reduced the airplane's weight from 135 pounds to 120 
pounds, said project leader Greg Hill, 23. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-foot-long aircraft is made of balsa wood, sturdy carbon fiber tubing and 
transparent Mylar, a plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is one of eight senior projects in the mechanical engineering 
department, whose students also designed a human-powered car and a 
human-powered hydrofoil, both of which are scheduled to make their debut Monday 
morning in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 a.m. Saturday, the weather was a major source of anxiety for the 
Pegasus team. An infrequent drizzle covered the wings with a film of water, 
which one student patiently scraped off with a yellow squeegee. Because of the 
wing's large surface area, Hill estimated that the drizzle added about 10 
pounds to the airplane's weight. 
</P>
<P>
Once the wires and propeller had been checked, the students pushed Pegasus 
across the soggy sod to the end of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing black tights, white tennis shoes and a Pegasus T-shirt, Pandes crawled 
into the triangular cockpit and experimented with the pedals. The covered 
cockpit bore the advertising logos of the dozen companies that donated about 
$8,000 to build Pegasus. 
</P>
<P>
The team positioned itself for the takeoff, one student holding up the end of 
each wing and several more supporting the fuselage and tail. Pandes began 
pedaling and Pegasus quivered unsteadily from nose to tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go, Jeanne," one student urged the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft lifted off the ground, traveling perhaps 15 feet, then one of the 
wires holding the wings to the fuselage snapped. The students repaired the wire 
and tried again. Pandes piloted the airplane for four more flights, the longest 
of which was about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Though the 110-pound Pandes had the advantage of being lightweight, Pegasus 
needed more power. So the second pilot, amateur cyclist Arcadio Biboso, was 
called in. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in yellow-and-black Spandex, Biboso's powerful legs lifted Pegasus on a 
60-foot flight. But he reported a problem with the pedaling mechanism -- the 
chain linking the pedals to the propeller shaft kept jerking, causing the 
airplane to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really control it," Biboso said. "I'm not really getting a steady 
rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The team discussed ways to correct the problem and, in a last-ditch effort, 
attached a chain-tightening device with quick-drying epoxy glue and some 
string. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, with Biboso at the controls, Pegasus made its longest 
flight ever: nearly 300 feet. The next attempt was even more successful, with 
the airplane staying aloft for more than 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But as Pegasus was landing, the right wing hit the ground and snapped in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the epoxy?" called one student. 
</P>
<P>
In a post-mortem of Pegasus' flight, Hill mourned that, "These wings are so 
long, so fragile . . . but that the plane has stayed together through all these 
rough landings says something for us, I guess."

COMMENTS ON LETTER ABOUT JURY DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having read Judy Perry's letter in the May 28 Orange County Edition of The 
Times, "How Jury Duty Alters View of Legal System," I understand her 
disappointment with the vacuous, would-be jury panelists surrounding her. 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded, therefore, of the old joke regarding anyone facing justice 
before the American legal system. It goes like this: "Would you want your life 
in the hands of 12 people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty?" 
</P>
<P>
I rest my case.

REA CENTER, NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The neighbors surrounding the Rea Center, which houses the SOS organization, 
are not only angry but afraid! So afraid that we no longer live normal lives! 
Our children can't play in their own front yards or walk to school alone for 
fear of being followed or harassed by an adult begging for money. Our children 
can't use the community park in our neighborhood for fear of being approached 
by a drunk or mentally disturbed person, or having these people exposing 
themselves. We have all experienced some type of problem that leaves us feeling 
helpless and a victim of this charity organization's do-good approach of saving 
mankind in our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the sympathy for the neighbors of Rea Center and for the problems we 
have been coping with for much too long? Look at the results of what has been 
brought into a quiet residential neighborhood and ask yourself if you'd want 
this in your own front yard? 
</P>
<P>
The Task Force Committee members representing the neighbors offered many 
possible, workable solutions to these problems, but SOS wasn't willing to give 
an inch or compromise. They insisted that it is their God-given right to feed, 
clothe and financially help anyone who asks without any restrictions, 
limitations or guidelines. And, regardless of our concerns, would not admit 
that they were at fault for bringing this into our community. They obviously 
don't seem concerned about those it so closely affects. 
</P>
<P>
The only alternative is for the SOS operation to relocate to a non-residential 
area away from children and schools and families who are harmed by this. I 
chose to live in Costa Mesa, but never anticipated the "skid row" environment I 
am facing on a daily basis. Please sympathize with the neighbors and their 
rights!

ANIMAL RIGHTS AND THE FOCUS OF ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must commend the young man featured in your Life section on May 19. I respect 
what he believes and is trying to do. However, this whole issue of animal 
rights, which is featured more and more often in The Times, has me concerned. 
</P>
<P>
I too am an animal lover, and have owned and loved many pets through the years 
-- every one of them a "rescue" case -- rescued from people who loved their 
animals too much to have them neutered. Like young Antonio Aguilar, I also 
looked into this movement when it first got my attention; unlike this young 
man, I have some years behind me, and I have some doubts and some questions. 
First, I disagree heartily with the statements, as repeated by Aguilar, that 
animals have the same rights as people -- or emotions either, for that matter. 
A rat is not a boy, although People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) 
literature says there is no difference. 
</P>
<P>
If animals are to live unexploited and free, and cannot be killed for any 
purpose, then I hope all these people love rats as much as they profess; they 
will soon be knee-deep in them. And, as much as I hate to be the bearer of bad 
news, animals in their own habitat eat each other. They eat their young too. 
The latest literature I got from PETA said that we are now to avoid silk and 
wool too (I think shearing the sheep makes them cold, or something). I guess 
that leaves polyester? Who is out there to speak for the environment which is 
being destroyed by the production of all of these oil-based synthetics? And 
isn't oil "endangered" too? 
</P>
<P>
If you think about it, animal "families" are being evicted from their homelands 
by homes and roads being built. Let's stop building? And since all we can eat 
is vegetables, how are we going to protect the crop from the birds, and rats 
and squirrels -- and all of the other vegetarians in our midst? I'd say share, 
but they multiply faster than we do, and I don't think these families know 
about birth control. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I own and wear and enjoy fur. I get cold. I am comfortable that my furs 
come from well-managed and maintained farms or from well-controlled and 
necessary trapping. I read. I eat meat too -- much as I think cows are cute. 
And I would unhesitatingly sacrifice all five of my well-loved pets in an 
instant to protect a child -- any child. Please, spare us from any more of 
these animal "rights" fund-raisers and rabble-rousers. I have a right to wear 
and to believe what I choose without fear of being harassed. 
</P>
<P>
Hooray for young people with a social conscience! Wouldn't it be nice if that 
social conscience was directed toward abused children or neglected old people?

WOMEN AND SURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel that Ocean Pacific is making a big mistake in dropping women from this 
year's OP surfing event in Huntington Beach. Therefore, I was pleased that The 
Times published an article (May 5) reporting on this decision and the 
disappointment expressed by the women competitors and by Graham Cassidy, 
executive director of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, the sanctioning body. 
</P>
<P>
I am a woman competitor on the ASP World Tour, have competed in this event 
annually since 1984 and have seen surfing emerge as a major worldwide sport, 
both for men and women, providing profits to sportswear clothing companies such 
as OP. Therefore, it is sad to see this negative direction take place. 
</P>
<P>
In The Times' article, OP says that it wants to make this year's event a great 
thing and that the women's contest isn't even "an issue" as far as OP is 
concerned. It also says that it wants to have a "hallmark" event, showcasing 
the sport. If it really wants to do that, why drop women's professional 
surfing, when that is a very important part of the ASP World Tour? One of the 
bad things about this situation is that OP apparently has not been completely 
honest about its motives and has not shown support this year for the entire 
sport of surfing, despite its claim to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the surfing industry, all of the competitors, men and women alike, 
and the public realize the important role that women surfing has played in the 
development of the sport, and will encourage American events, such as the OP 
competition, to continue to include women surfing as an integral part of 
professional competition.

CRUISE VIEWS: YOUNG PASSENGERS CAN MAKE WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch are Los Angeles free-lance 
writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although children are becoming increasingly welcome on board cruise liners, 
before booking a cruise find out if the line offers programs for kids and 
whether there will be other children on the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Even well-traveled youngsters can get bored on board. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect free 24-hour baby-sitting. Youth counselors are aboard to enrich 
your child's vacation, not take him off your hands. 
</P>
<P>
If you think you'll need a baby-sitter, before booking the cruise ask if crew 
members will be available for baby-sitting duty, and inquire about the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid booking a family trip on a line that does not offer free or discounted 
travel, counselors and special programs for children. The lack of such is 
usually a tip-off that the line prefers adult clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Lines offering special summer prices and programs for children include American 
Hawaii, Carnival, Chandris, Commodore, Costa, Delta Queen Steamboat Co., 
Dolphin, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Premier and Regency. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year Sitmar had the most active shipboard program for children. 
However, since Sitmar was absorbed by Princess there seems to be decreased 
emphasis on youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
Premier, Costa and Regency offer discount prices for single-parent families by 
charging the parent a per-person, double-occupancy rate and the child a lower 
third- or fourth-passenger fare. 
</P>
<P>
Premier also offers a seven-day package with a Bahamas cruise and Disney World 
stay. The price ranges from $595 to $1,095 per person, double occupancy, for 
adults, depending on accommodations; $225 to $295 for children in the same 
room. 
</P>
<P>
It will be copied by Carnival for February, 1990, when the Carnivale will be 
repositioned to Port Canaveral for three- and four-day Bahamas sailings 
packaged with Disney World programs. 
</P>
<P>
This summer Carnival's fare for children sharing a cabin with two full-fare 
adults is $395 on all seven-day cruises, $190 and $250 on three- and four-day 
cruises. In some cabins Carnival can add a fifth berth. 
</P>
<P>
Cribs and high chairs are available on all ships, and baby-sitting is offered 
at a nominal charge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Carnival's "Junior Cruisers" program has been extended from 
limited sailings to sailings year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Regency Cruises offers free Caribbean sailings between June 18 and Aug. 27 for 
the child who shares a cabin as the third passenger with two full-fare adults. 
The fare for another child, traveling as the fourth passenger, is $195. 
</P>
<P>
Regent Star seven-day sailings depart on Sunday from Montego Bay, Jamaica, with 
two itineraries. One includes Costa Rica, Cartagena, Aruba and a partial 
transit of the Panama Canal. The other includes Ocho Rios, St. Thomas, St. 
Barts, St. Martin and San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Special shore excursions for young people will be available, including a 
snorkeling safari, as well as shipboard disco parties, games, crafts and 
special children's videos. 
</P>
<P>
Single parents and single grandparents also get a fare break from Regency for 
Regent Star sailings. The parent or grandparent pays the per-person, 
double-occupancy rate on the three lowest-priced categories available (from 
$1,065 to $1,315). Children under 12 travel for $665 to $695. 
</P>
<P>
Adult air fare is included, but children fly for $195 to $395, depending on the 
gateway city. 
</P>
<P>
A children's counselor offering programs on American history will be aboard 
seven-day cruises on the paddle-wheeler Mississippi Queen, departing New 
Orleans Aug. 11, 18 and 25; Sept. 1 and 15, and Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Children through 16 years can travel free with two full-fare adults booking a 
cabin from a minimum of $2,065 per person, double occupancy. Two additional 
children under 16 will be accommodated free in a separate cabin, if space is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Costs include free round-trip air fare for parents. For more information, call 
the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. toll-free at (800) 543-1949. 
</P>
<P>
Between Thursday and Sept. 2 American Hawaii will allow up to two children, 16 
or younger, to cruise free in any cabin costing $1,725 per person, double 
occupancy, and higher, when accompanied by two full-fare passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Kids can cruise free with Chandris on all Bermuda sailings this summer, if they 
are under 12 and share a cabin with two full-fare adults. Air fare is extra. 
</P>
<P>
The line charges children $499 to $799 for other seven-day cruises. This 
includes air fare for travelers under 12 who share a cabin with two full-fare 
adults. Children under 2 years travel free.

TRAVELER'S DIARY: 'DAUGHTER OF THE BALTIC' IS WORTH A SECOND LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
HELSINKI, Finland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call this city the "Daughter of the Baltic." Like many daughters she is 
often stylish, handsome and well-groomed. Sometimes she is notably expensive. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Baltic, it seems to wash up at every turning. Even the market square 
lies in the shadow of ships and ferries waiting to sail to Stockholm or 
Leningrad or Tallinn. 
</P>
<P>
Sea gulls fly a maze of sorties over the open-air fish market, where 
specialties are offered as well as species more easily identified by wanderers 
from the New World. Alongside are vendors selling mounds of strawberries from 
Holland and kiwi fruit from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Helsinki is the city of furs. While serious shopping takes place along the 
Esplanade, one also finds furs at stalls near the harbor edge, in sight of the 
ice breakers turned out by Finnish shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
The stroller can pick up a mink hat for $170, or one in fox for $130 or blue 
fox for $110. Bargaining is in order here, although not along the Esplanade. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing at Marimekko, odd wooden sheep sculptures at Aarikka, glassware at the 
I-Shop, home of Iittalia crystal, housewares and ornaments at Arabia, are all 
found on the Esplanade, Helsinki's Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish architectural taste is evident in its railroad station, the work of 
Eero Saarinen. It was Saarinen's son, Eliel, who designed the TWA terminal at 
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, as well as the severe black headquarters 
of CBS in Manhattan known as "Black Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Architectural taste is also evident in the majestic Lutheran Cathedral 
dominating Senate Square. Completed in 1852 after 30 years' work, the 
cathedral's grand stairway is a popular place for Finns in search of a tan. 
</P>
<P>
A statue of Alexander II, the Russian czar, stands in the square, a memorial to 
his liberal attitude toward the Finns. 
</P>
<P>
Surely one of the world's most unusual places of worship is Helsinki's 
Temppeliaukio Church, which was hewn out of rock, then surrounded with quarried 
stone and bound together with steel. 
</P>
<P>
About 750 souls gather on purple-cushioned pews under a domed skylight to hear 
a sermon, to see the candles flickering against the rock walls and to hear the 
organ music filtering out of the pipes set into the stone. 
</P>
<P>
Not a sound comes from the cluster of pipes that form the monument to Jean 
Sibelius, however. They make up a sculpture by Eila Hiltunen that sits in a 
small park near a sculpted bust of the famed composer.

HER WORLD: SERENDIPITOUS MEETINGS A LONG WAY FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a small world" is a large cliche. Yet like other words grown trite, it 
was born of truth. 
</P>
<P>
Returning travelers tell tales of mind-boggling coincidences and 
confrontations: They were waiting for a light to change on a Paris corner when 
they saw an office pal waving from across the boulevard. They went to the 
theater in London and who should they see at intermission but . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two women in my aerobics class just came back from Europe; one was visiting her 
mother in Germany and the other was touring Bulgaria. They ran into each other 
in a mall in Munich on the only day that both were in that city. 
</P>
<P>
I know the syndrome well. As I signed a leather-bound register at a country inn 
in Denmark I saw that friends from my city and street had been guests the week 
before. 
</P>
<P>
As I walked up the cobbled streets of Sveti Stefan, the Yugoslav fishing 
village turned resort, my companion was hailed by a college classmate from 
Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
And once, when I was bargaining badly in Bangkok, a merchant interrupted the 
proceedings to inquire about the health of an antiques dealer in my hometown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predictable Paths 
</P>
<P>
In some harder-to-reach destinations, crossed paths are even more predictable. 
Roads may be few. Train seats are limited. Riverboats always dock at the same 
villages. And Western travelers have little choice but to head for the same 
clutch of hostelries. For me, this does not lessen the magic; it adds to the 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
On a long flight to Egypt a few Novembers ago I reread a newspaper account that 
my aunt had written about her week on the Nile. It was accompanied by 
photographs of children playing on the river bank at Idfu. 
</P>
<P>
When our boat stopped there, youngsters came racing from their homes. Two girls 
wore matching dresses of a bold floral print. I recognized the fabric; it was 
in my aunt's picture. 
</P>
<P>
I returned to my cabin to dig out the clipping, and gave it to the girls. I 
knew from their squeals that the identification was right. 
</P>
<P>
And what, if any, is the moral of all this far-flung happenstance? According to 
some travelers, it's "beware." 
</P>
<P>
A fellow I know was in Moscow for the first time, standing at dusk in Red 
Square, feeling alone at the end of the world. Suddenly he was hailed by a 
raspy voice that he thought he'd left behind in California, a gadfly who had 
been fighting him in city hall over a public parking issue. 
</P>
<P>
"And another thing! . . .," she cried, waving her umbrella as she raced toward 
him from the shadows of the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
"At that moment I decided that no place on earth offers anonymity," he told me. 
"Thank goodness I wasn't buying black-market rubles or chasing Russian girls." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise encounters can have exuberant charm, but not always. I heard of a 
couple who checked into a European hideaway and were greeted warmly. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderful to see you," gushed the proprietor. "The same room as last year?" 
The woman, for whom it was a first visit, was aghast. The man, ever fast on his 
feet, said solemnly: "It's not what you think, my dear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiar Face 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I was climbing the stairs in the labyrinth of Jimmy's Harborside 
restaurant in Boston when a voice called: "Judith?" 
</P>
<P>
I turned and saw a familiar face in an unfamiliar setting. It was a businessman 
from Oklahoma, there with his wife and daughter, a student at Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd see you," he said, laughing. "Your mother's a witch, you know. 
She said you were in Boston and we'd probably run into you." 
</P>
<P>
Serendipity reached out and touched me in Norway one July evening. My husband 
and I arrived in Oslo by train and had no hotel reservation. We took a cab to 
the Bristol because the name was familiar and the location central. Yes, they 
had a room. 
</P>
<P>
I had kicked off my shoes and was eyeing the down comforter when a call came 
from the front desk. Some San Diego friends were downstairs and wanted to toast 
my birthday with champagne. I had forgotten that our trips might overlap. They 
had assumed that we would stay at the same hotel. 
</P>
<P>
After hugs in the lobby they led me around the corner to a club named Zebra or 
Zodiac or Jaguar. It was almost midnight. All I remember for certain is that 
the maitre d' greeted me with, "Telephone call for Judith Morgan." I knew it 
was a joke. No one knew where I was, including myself. 
</P>
<P>
When I picked up the receiver, my parents broke into a long-distance chorus of 
"Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
"How did you find me?" I asked in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
"You were staying at the Bristol in Bergen," said my father, the reporter. "So 
I thought we'd try the same name in Oslo." 
</P>
<P>
And the alert desk clerk who had welcomed us had given him the phone number of 
the club.

cold and bruised all over, even though there hadn't been anything bigger than a 
few pine needles under my sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
I lurched over to where somebody had forgotten to bank the coals the evening 
before and, using fingers that felt like a couple of frozen bananas, started 
making a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"You up?" asked a lump in one of the other sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
"Coffee will be ready in either a few minutes or a couple of hours," I said, 
starting on my second book of matches. I was trying to light half a road map I 
had stuffed under the kindling. 
</P>
<P>
I'd have been just as happy to have the fire going before any of the guys I'd 
gone backpacking with got up. Kit Carson or Daniel Boone would never have used 
a map to get a fire started. 
</P>
<P>
The flame caught, inched through the Eastern states and out into the Atlantic 
Ocean and started on the pine needles. 
</P>
<P>
I went over to the limb where I'd hung my pants the night before. They had 
fallen and were so stiff with frost that they were almost unbendable. It was 
that morning, while putting on those pants, that I moved out of Phase 1 
vacations and into Phase 2. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years you have to keep measuring the fun of the vacation experience 
against the discomfort. That morning my first measuring resulted in the end of 
Phase 1. 
</P>
<P>
Phase 2 is when you admit you've turned into a "walls" person. It's when you 
decide to rent accommodations and leave sleeping outside to the lions and 
tigers and bears. 
</P>
<P>
My wife Joyce and I had our first Phase 2 vacation a few years after the 
children came, when the six of us went to the mountains. We rented a cabin at 
Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
That cabin was about half past ramshackle, with loose boards, a ceiling you 
could see the stars through and a water heater so old that if it hadn't had hot 
flashes, it wouldn't have worked at all. 
</P>
<P>
But the place did have screens (to keep the mosquitoes in) and all the comforts 
of home . . . if the home hadn't seen any improvements since about, say, 1931. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of television the kids would line up to watch me light the oven. You 
could say they got a bang out of it, although it was mostly like a whooomp, and 
I was the one who got it. I lost an eyebrow and all the hair off my right arm, 
but it beat live television for excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its faults, that cabin and the vacation we spent in it was a great 
success. 
</P>
<P>
On our last day there I asked John, then about 6, a rhetorical question. 
</P>
<P>
"John, how'd you like to swap our house for this place?" 
</P>
<P>
He gave a yell and started jumping up and down. He was all for it and so were 
the girls. 
</P>
<P>
Kids don't understand rhetorical questions. I'm not altogether sure they ever 
really forgave me for not arranging a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Most of our Phase 2 accommodations have been fun, no matter where in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris there's a little place on the Rue de Lille, on the Left Bank, that's 
sort of typical of the European Phase 2. It's called the Hotel De Lille, and it 
suits us fine. 
</P>
<P>
The last time we were there I realized that if you sat down in the tub your 
chin automatically came to rest on your knees. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the room had red-flocked wallpaper on one wall, and they had hung a 
Chinese-red patchwork quilt on the wall opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from making the 10-by-10-foot room feel like a 6-by-6 room, when you woke 
up in the morning you got the feeling you were having an out-of-body experience 
and that you were floating somewhere over an empty quilted bed. 
</P>
<P>
We got used to it. You can get used to a lot of things if the price is right. 
We were paying a great deal less than the big hotels charge. We don't really 
spend much time in our room when we're in Paris anyway, so we'll probably be 
going back to that little hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The first time on our own in London we booked a bed and breakfast through the 
Victoria Station tourist office. 
</P>
<P>
The taxi took us to a beautiful old part of the city and the manager met us at 
the door. "Welcome to the Hotel Sydney," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He helped me haul our luggage from the taxi into the entryway, then poured us 
large glasses of wine. "I have some good news and some bad news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Good news first," said Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lovely room for you with a simply marvelous view of London and the 
drinks are free." He said "cheers" and we drank the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"And the bad news?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You and your lovely wife are on the sixth floor and there's no lift." 
</P>
<P>
The view was great. The room was nice. The full English breakfast was a marvel 
and, by and large, we were above the city noise. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of our week's stay, though Joyce took the stair-climbing in 
stride, I had developed what I figured would be terminal leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
Now when we go to London we stay at a little hotel in Chiswick, where they 
assign us a room on the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
We've ducked in and out of Phase 3. It includes organized tours and cruises 
where the tour company sees to your sleeping arrangements and meals, handles 
all the luggage and even does most of the tipping. 
</P>
<P>
Phase 3 is tops for people who like other people, who don't mind looking like 
tourists and who aren't too proud to accept a little help sightseeing and 
shopping. Some of our most valued friendships have been made on Phase 3 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Phases 4 and 5 feature big resort hotels complete with golf courses, stables, 
tennis courts, pools, saunas and gymnasiums. They have so much to offer, in 
fact, that you can do your whole vacation without leaving the hotel grounds. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of ours came back from a Club Med vacation, which is about Phase 5. He 
was tanned, happy and more rested than we'd ever seen him. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked where he'd been, he had to think for a moment. "Did I bring you a 
bottle?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"What was it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Tequila," said Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Mexico? Yes, Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
There are tours that are about Phase 5 and sometimes 6. Phase 6 is the kind 
where the maitre d' faints if you ask for a chicken-fried steak. 
</P>
<P>
And if you've got enough mischief in your soul, you can ask for the "soupe du 
jour of the day and a nice bottle of Chateau Briand to wash it down," then 
watch the whole dining room and kitchen staff faint. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Even these days, when the dollar isn't at its best abroad, you can still get 
bargain lodgings without giving up too much. I've listed some of the ones we 
like. 
</P>
<P>
You can do with a foot or two less tub, but you really don't need a sixth-floor 
walk-up, so ask questions before you make reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel De Lille, 40 Rue de Lille, 75007 Paris, a quarter mile from the Louvre. 
The rate is 440 francs (about $68 U.S.) a night, double. 
</P>
<P>
Chiswick Hotel, 73 High Road, London W4 2LS. The BBC frequently books 
out-of-town crews here. The rate is 55 (about $90 U.S.) a night, double. 
</P>
<P>
Coity Mawr Manor, Talybont-on-Usk, Near Brecon, Powys LD3 7YN, Wales. Ask for 
Bryn or Liz Drew. It's an 18th-Century Georgian manor house with total 
seclusion, but activities are within easy reach. Rate: 45 a night, double. 
</P>
<P>
Old Gwernyfed Country Manor, Three Cocks, Brecon, Powys, Wales. Ask for Dawn 
and Roger Beetham. We haven't stayed in this Elizabethan manor, but even Bryn 
and Liz Drew recommend it. The rate is 45 to 55 a night, double.

DINING IN NICE

<TEXT>
<P>
I read Beverly Beyer and Ed Rabey's article on Nice ("Footloose," May 21) with 
interest because I was there in March and happened to eat at La Belle Nicoise. 
It was good, but I enjoyed the fish and selection more at Grand Pavois-Chez 
Michel, 11 Rue Mayerbeer, near the Promenade des Anglais. Elegant atmosphere, 
and the owners really made me feel welcome. Highest recommendation.

COSTA RICA CLARIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the Costa Rica National Tourist Bureau I wish to express our 
gratitude for Geri Massion's article on Costa Rica ("Volcano Adds Touch of 
Drama to Costa Rica Trip," May 21). I do, however, wish to clarify the 
statement: "Eco Tours, an agency of the Costa Rica Tourist Board . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rica Tourist Board is an Institution of the Government of Costa Rica 
and, as such, is responsible for tourism development and promotion of the 
country. It is totally untrue that Eco Tours is an agency of the Tourist Board, 
since we do not have (such an agency) and are expressly prohibited from doing 
so by our government. Our responsibilities lie in dealing impartially with all 
wholesalers who promote the country.

BIG BEAR LAKE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hi: Camp is fun. 
</P>
<P>
I've made lots of new friends. 
</P>
<P>
 We ate tostadas and toasted marshmallows. 
</P>
<P>
We made boo-boo bunnies out of washcloths. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, Mom 
</P>
<P>
It was group photo time. Camp director Carol Smith-Carter shepherded her happy 
campers into rows and, just before the camera clicked, shouted "One-two-three 
-- laundry!" The campers answered with a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
This was Mother's Camp and Mother's Camp is not about doing laundry or planning 
meals or washing dishes. 
</P>
<P>
It is, rather, what Smith-Carter calls "a three-day getaway for moms," a 
respite from car pools and sibling squabbles and Little League. The brochure 
for Mother's Camp says it all: "No cooking, no chores, no kids!" 
</P>
<P>
If the dishwasher overflows (and it did), let it. Someone else will mop up. If 
the phone rings, let it. Someone else will answer. As assistant director Katie 
Plecity instructs the camper moms, "Live the way your kids normally would." 
</P>
<P>
Weekend activities include a spin around Big Bear Lake aboard a pontoon boat 
and a one-hour horseback ride along a mountain trail. ("Please, God, I'm the 
mother of three," pleaded one novice rider who had drawn a particularly 
recalcitrant mare.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soaking in Bubble Bath 
</P>
<P>
But for many campers, the real R&amp;R is the luxury of being totally 
self-indulgent in the knowledge that someone else is in charge at home. For 
Diane Solomon, a mother of three from Torrance, the ultimate camp experience 
was soaking in a bubble bath while sipping champagne and nibbling a chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon's husband, Bob, a contractor, had tucked a gift certificate for 
Mother's Camp into her Christmas stocking. 
</P>
<P>
Ellie Kenney, 43, of Moorpark, a single parent who is the mother of four 
children ranging in age from 8 to 15 -- as well as a part-time college 
instructor and a weekend emergency-room nurse -- had only one agenda: "Rest is 
what I came for. I registered for the couch potato decathlon." 
</P>
<P>
This is not camp, as in tents and mosquitoes. These campers figure they've 
served their time as good scouts and mothers of scouts. Base camp is the 
Edgewater Motel at lake's edge, where roughing it means rooms may not have 
remote-control television and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Campers make their own beds, but bed-making isn't encouraged. Smith-Carter's 
philosophy is, "If it absolutely drives you nuts, then throw the covers up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Janet Paulus, 38, of La Mesa in San Diego County, mother of two, full-time 
homemaker and partner in a home-based basket-weaving business: "The big thing 
this place has is no decisions. The biggest decision we've had to make was 
whether to go on boat 1 or boat 2." 
</P>
<P>
Cookie Johnson, the cook, was setting out the fixings for a Mexican supper. "Do 
you know how to make your own tostadas?" she asked the women. They did. Johnson 
smiled and said, "I figured this group would." 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Camp is not a spa, and spa cuisine isn't spoken here. Consider 
Friday's dinner: Meatball shish kebabs, potato-cheese soup, corn muffins, 
spinach salad and homemade cheesecake. Comfort food. 
</P>
<P>
"These women are eaters," observed Johnson, whose meal for 20 had been 
demolished by the 16 campers. For the first meal or two, campers wrestled with 
the urge to jump up and do the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
For three days, Johnson's kitchen produced down-home treats like pineapple 
upside-down cake, calories be hanged. And late at night, in Room 1, the 
penny-ante Tripoley players stoked up on illicit treats they'd brought to camp 
from the Price Club -- institutional size packages of corn curls and nuts and 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
Mija Anton, 33, a single parent from Costa Mesa, had come to camp straight from 
a health farm in Lancaster where she'd gone to drop a few pounds. She figured 
she'd just gained them back, but never mind, she'd be in shape for her planned 
climb of Mt. Whitney this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Like kids playing hooky, campers permitted themselves such simple pleasures as 
reading romance novels in bed. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Leboffe, 36, a homemaker and mother of three who came from the La Mesa 
area with her friends Janet Paulus and Dianne Tuohy, was typical of many 
campers: "Except for having other children, I've never been away" from the 
family. Paulus laughed and added, "Three days in the hospital just doesn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Camp, Leboffe said, was her reward for having kept the children quiet 
and occupied while her husband, a community college biology teacher, wrote a 
textbook. "I'd never go anywhere by myself," she said, "but this is safe." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 16 campers came as a group, most of them from the San Fernando 
Valley, a loosely knit coalition of friends and acquaintances linked by having 
been together in running a co-op nursery school or having bowled in the same 
league or played on the same 
</P>
<P>
softball team. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they are full-time homemakers, women who shepherd scout 
troops, who are school volunteers, and who ferry their children and those of 
classmates with working mothers to the big games. Mother's Camp was founded, in 
part, on Smith-Carter's belief that this endangered species is making a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
She said: "The trend, it seems, is shifting back to motherhood. We thought, 
'Yeah, it's time for this.' " And Smith-Carter, the mother of two daughters and 
a former newspaper advertising woman, knows, "These women are tired by the time 
they get here. I think women are realizing, 'I really need a break. I do 
deserve this.' They go back home and the family appreciates them more, and they 
appreciate the family more." 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Camp runs on a schedule, sort of. Dinner may be served at 6, or it may 
appear sometime before 7. The point is that it doesn't really matter. At this 
particular session, a mix-up at the Magic Mountain stables resulted in too many 
riders for too few horses. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Plecity was unfazed. She covered the 5-mile trail on foot, keeping up 
with the riders while pointing out dwarf mistletoe and woodpecker holes and 
mountain flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Plecity is a part-time camp director and a full-time concrete finisher in 
construction. "And like a lot of people in the mountains, I'm an artist," she 
explained, "waiting to be discovered." Meanwhile, she has been commissioned to 
paint two life-size bulls for a local meat market. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the women reflected on the mix-up at the stable, noting with 
satisfaction, "Usually, as Mom, that's the kind of hassle I have to handle." 
Paulus agreed, "I got my money's worth right there." 
</P>
<P>
Smith-Carter's husband, Tim Carter, is the trouble-shooter who responds to SOSs 
from camp for firewood or marshmallows or maybe spare packets of toy eyes for 
the boo-boo bunnies that campers make during Sunday's champagne brunch and 
crafts hour. 
</P>
<P>
During one camp he fielded an emergency call for baking powder. But, through a 
comedy of errors, it was salt in a baking powder can that he delivered to the 
cake-baker. Puzzled, Smith-Carter wondered why none of the campers wanted their 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
"One mom was so worried about hurting our feelings that she actually ate it," 
she said. "Another slipped it into a napkin," then into the trash. A trick 
known to children since the whole rigmarole began. 
</P>
<P>
Camp lore abounds. There was the time the gas line broke on the boat, leaving 
campers powerless and adrift in midlake. So what's a mother to do? Improvise, 
of course. With a colorful parka tied to the tip of an oar, the women waved 
frantically until rescued by a passing boat. 
</P>
<P>
And camp conversation? Well, it tends to revolve around home and kids and sex 
education in the schools and stretch marks. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday brunch, the final event, campers prepared for re-entry as they passed 
around the Target stores newspaper ad -- maybe they could pick up some toilet 
tissue, or other sale item, on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
For 2 1/2 days, most campers easily resisted any urge to call home. Donna 
Parker, 36, of Reseda, a one-day-a-week paper hanger and the mother of three, 
including an 18-year-old and an 18-month-old, sent flowers to her husband, 
Randy, who was taking care of the children. After all, it was their wedding 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Severtson, 41, a mother of four from Mission Hills, was glued to the 
television set -- the Lakers vs. Phoenix. "When I signed up," she explained, "I 
didn't know it would be the first game of the series." 
</P>
<P>
But the other campers seemed quite happy not to have to watch sports on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping -- that was another matter. The boutiques of Big Bear were a magnet, 
shoppers returning with -- what else? -- T-shirts and other souvenirs for their 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, campers would fantasize about leaving the big city forever 
and moving to a town like Big Bear (population 15,000), where their children 
could grow up seeing bald eagles instead of graffiti, where they might get away 
from crime and drugs and drinking and clothing with logos on every seam. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Camp is about escape. But, as Paulus acknowledged, "I start to get 
nervous if I can't get to a mall." 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing in the bubbling Jacuzzi at the local athletic club (a camp perk) with 
Tuohy, her partner in the basket-weaving enterprise, and Leboffe, she leaned 
back and said, "You know, the best part of being here is that we don't have to 
worry about who's cooking dinner." 
</P>
<P>
For Susan Gray, 42, a petite mother of two from Granada Hills, Mother's Camp 
with its be-pampered policy was a double treat. She is a homemaker, a school 
volunteer -- and she works outside the home as a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
She had left her husband in charge at home, figuring, "If the kids are going to 
kill each other, they'll kill each other. I'm not worried." Then she laughed as 
she recalled the only other time she took a vacation from the family, about 10 
years ago: "I was so glad to get home to my husband that two months later I was 
pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Terri Swig, 35, a mother of two and part-time school aide from Moorpark, summed 
up the secret of Mother's Camp: "There's places to ride horses at home, places 
to play racquetball at home, but there's just never time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
When she told her husband, Allen, she wanted to go to camp, she said, "His 
first reaction was, WHAT? And my kids said, 'You can't go.' " But she knew, 
"They can handle themselves fine, as long as I'm not there. Going out the door 
is the tough part." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Reichenbach, 38, a full-time homemaker and mother of two from Canyon 
Country, thought of Saturday at camp as a day off. At home, she said, 
"Saturdays are usually spent running one or both of the kids around." She said: 
"Family's real important to us. That's why they don't resent it when I take a 
little time off." 
</P>
<P>
Campers sipped champagne from plastic glasses and nibbled chocolate-dipped 
strawberries as their boat circled the lake. Popping a cork and tossing it into 
the water, Smith-Carter assured the group, "It's biodegradable." 
</P>
<P>
But if anyone was feeling slightly giddy, it was from the freedom, not the 
alcohol. "We're reverting back to our childhood," one said. "We played 
kick-the-can on our way shopping, I mean, come on. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Around their "porta-bonfire," they sang a round of "It Was Sad When the Great 
Ship Went Down." The coat hangers on which they toasted marshmallows made 
someone think of Christina Crawford's allegation in "Mommy Dearest" that Joan 
Crawford became hysterical if little Christina used wire hangers instead of 
padded hangers for her dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"God," Paulus said, "I'd be so thankful just to see clothes on hangers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday noon, the craft hour, new friendships had been forged. Carefully 
rolling pastel washcloths to make boo-boo bunnies, campers had to make one of 
the heavy decisions of the weekend: What color ribbon to tie around their 
bunnies' necks. 
</P>
<P>
Several campers acknowledged feeling just a bit foolish. After all, hadn't they 
taught little Bluebirds to make boo-boo bunnies? (For the 
</P>
<P>
uninitiated, a boo-boo bunny is designed to hold an ice cube to be applied as a 
cold pack to an injured child.) 
</P>
<P>
Smith-Carter glanced around the roomful of women painstakingly crafting bunnies 
and observed, "Twenty years fighting for our rights, down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
Anton, who has made two parachute jumps, glued her bunny's eyes into position 
and said, "Isn't this exciting!" 
</P>
<P>
There would be warm hugs all around before the campers started the long drive 
down the mountain.

Mother's Camp is an idea that was born in 1982 when Smith-Carter, 39, a camp 
counselor during her college years, and a friend were filling out camp forms 
for their kids and decided, "There should be a camp for us." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, she and her family moved from Sierra Madre to Big Bear. After 
testing her concept with some "pioneer Moms," she decided it was an idea whose 
time had come, and a year ago became a full-time camp director. 
</P>
<P>
Every weekend, except holidays, Mother's Camp hosts between 12 and 20-plus 
campers, each of whom pays $220, meals and all activities included, for a 
single room, $185 for a shared double (discounted for groups). Nothing is 
extra, except the optional in-room Swedish massage. 
</P>
<P>
Day in and day out, "It seems moms still put themselves at the bottom of the 
list," Smith-Carter said. "If there's a burnt piece of chicken, they'll put it 
on their plate. Their kids are 8 or 9 years old and they've never been away." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed as she recalled watching one camper field a telephone call from 
home, issuing instructions and automatically starting to wash the dishes with 
one hand as she talked. 
</P>
<P>
At camp, she said, the "real key" is campers know "another mother is taking 
care of them." And there is the camaraderie, 15 or 20 other mothers with whom 
they can share war stories from the home front. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to keep it real light," Smith-Carter said. Mother's Camp is for fun, 
not for solving major problems. "We have the combination of the woman feeling 
safe, the husband feeling good about it and even the kids feeling good about 
mom going to camp." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 women are now alumnae of Mother's Camp, which is strictly for mothers 
over 21. The word has spread through networking by former campers and, yes, 
Smith-Carter said, some campers have told her they heard about it at a 
Tupperware party. 
</P>
<P>
As some women are hesitant about making the drive to Big Bear during the 
winter, she is exploring "off the mountain" locales for winter camps, checking 
out beach and desert sites. She also is looking into the possibility of 
honest-to-goodness camps, tents and all, but isn't convinced that this is most 
mothers' idea of a fun time away. 
</P>
<P>
Over Mother's Day, the first deluxe Mother's Camp was offered at Sleepy Forest 
Lodge, where amenities include in-room Jacuzzis and fireplaces. This upscale 
camp will cost between $350 and $450, will be limited to 12 women and will 
include a massage and a limo ride to a restaurant for Sunday brunch. 
</P>
<P>
But, Smith-Carter said, "We don't ever want to lose the woman who has four kids 
and is on a budget." So convinced is she of the need that she is looking into 
expansion -- "We would like to franchise and go across the United States." 
</P>
<P>
As the recent group of 16 campers headed home, some were already talking about 
coming again. Karen Leboffe, away from home for the first time, said, "Now I 
know I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Paulus said she'd return "any minute." Wasn't it wonderful, she mused, a 
whole weekend in which "nobody spilled their milk."

FICTION IN BRIEF: RESCUE, STORIES, BY STEPHEN O'CONNOR (HARMONY/CROWN: $17.95;

Stephen O'Connor is one of several promising young artists, from film director 
Bruce Robinson ("How To Get Ahead in Advertising") to writer Andrei Codrescu, 
who are using surrealism not to bypass our dulling consciousness in search of 
deeper truth, but to avoid the limitations of traditional storytelling. 
O'Connor in particular eschews the narrative because he disputes its assumption 
that characters evolve over time, affecting and being affected by their 
environment. Emphasizing images rather than action, moods rather than plot, 
O'Connor creates impotent characters who drift in the subjectivity of the 
moment, able to value something only once they have lost it. 
</P>
<P>
In the title story, for instance, a skier injured in an avalanche hallucinates 
about his wife; he imagines her taking him home (whose richness is suggested by 
overflowing baskets of apples and mangoes), where he rediscovers his "infinite" 
love for her, "primal and vast." Suddenly, though, she is gone: "I wanted to 
run after her. . . . I was paralyzed by the awful thought that I might never 
find her and she would never know this vast, wonderful and terrible feeling 
that I had for her." 
</P>
<P>
Several other stories also evoke feelings of longing, but carry subtle moral 
messages as well. In "Help," for example, a man is seduced by a a seductive 
woman he sees leaning on a bridge railing. When she jumps, he follows, hitting 
"water . . . so cold that I felt like I'd crashed face first onto solid ice." 
He is carried away from land by the same strong current that is taking the girl 
away. An original depiction of the way an obsession can sweep us off sure 
footing, "Help" also elaborates on the theme of good and evil which is 
established by quotes from Job that introduce some chapters. O'Connor 
highlights the often-deceptive appeal of purity (suggested by the woman's 
"shiny and pink feet") in an apocalyptic age (cinders as well as shards of 
glass cover the bridge). 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's best evocation of our shaky sense of morality is "The Only Life," a 
story set in the future in which a pest control agent discovers Alfred Zot, the 
administrator responsible for the last world war -- only Zot, overwhelmed by 
guilt, has turned into a rat. The agent spares Zot out of sympathy, but begins 
using his moral outrage at Zot selectively, sparing it when Zot's knowledge of 
an ancient water main where rodents drink (the "Rat Riviera") helps him win a 
promotion, but summoning it when it becomes politic for him to kill the 
creature.

This comedy of errors owes its charm to its endearingly sensitive and 
unpretentious protagonist, Charlie Shapes, the middle-aged, Jewish owner of a 
store for top-grade stereo equipment. Like Saul Bellow's Mr. Sammler, Shapes 
(it's Shah-pis, he is forever telling people) is searching for some glimmer of 
beauty and promise in a tragicomic world. Shapes is more forgiving than 
Sammler, though, too amused by follies of his own and others to become brooding 
or cynical, even when he begins to realize that in life, no good deed goes 
unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
As in his 1982 novel, "Only Shorter," Ross Feld spins a unique kind of dark 
comedy, one laced with empathy. While much of Feld's humor comes from depicting 
hapless lives, he is never condescending, encouraging us to laugh with, not at, 
his busily eccentric characters: the owners of the failing "D-Lux Motel 
Restaurant" (rushing to please Shapes, their only lunch customer, they pat his 
back, dole out huge portions of food and come up with "surprise desserts," as 
if, a friend of Shapes quips, "they were next going to serve up their virgin 
daughter"); Shapes' son-in-law Bennett, "a skinny kid who flew against the wind 
to love (Shapes' daughter) . . . and then, in essence, collapsed around 
himself, all initiative gone"; and Shapes himself, trying to seduce a local 
judge by timidly offering to photograph her ("I do mostly nature studies. 
Indoor still lifes . . . figure studies") but meeting, as always, with 
disappointment. "As much as he would have liked to renounce his habit of 
renunciation," Feld writes, "life tended to have other ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Shapes takes these defeats in stride, but midway through this novel, 
his wife dies and his usually sure sense of equanimity begins to shows signs of 
strain. Suffering a panic attack while walking on a parkway, he sees "the sky 
itself jumping higher and broader.... The surface outline of things seemed the 
same, but stretchier -- everything giving itself more and more inner room, 
loden-leafed yew bushes becoming unlimited forests, sycamores swaying in 
breezes reaching them from unthinkable realms of sky, covering miles with each 
tremble." 
</P>
<P>
After several weeks of biofeedback therapy, Shapes recovers and regains 
authority over his life. We never doubt that he will make it, though, for 
Shapes is gifted with an ability to remain open to the world that enables him 
to tolerate social conflicts that most people would find claustrophobic. Even 
in the midst of his panic attack, for instance, he confronts the "elongating 
world" by stretching out his arms "in frightened greeting to all this awesome 
clearance."

FICTION IN BRIEF: UP THROUGH THE WATER, BY DARCEY STEINKE,(DOUBLEDAY: $16.95;

The sensuous lure of summer -- from primal, enveloping ocean water to the warm 
touch of the sun -- is vividly evoked in this first novel, set on an island off 
the North Carolina coast where the 25-year-old author used to vacation with her 
family. Emily, Darcey Steinke's protagonist, embodies summer's indulgent 
spirit; most often swimming or relaxing on a yacht, she appears in one typical 
scene with her hand "cupped around a wineglass, the other resting on her thigh, 
and her back against the metal of the chair. She settled into herself and 
lifted her glass for more." 
</P>
<P>
Emily's beau is initially John Berry, a ferry operator whom she sees as part of 
her sensuous summer world, as "a wave moving toward the bed." When Berry begins 
talking of Earthly matters such as marriage, though, she drops him for a 
younger man, the Hippie-ish "Birdflower," whom she eventually spurns as well. 
One might think that Steinke is setting Emily up for disappointment, but she 
never seriously confronts Emily with the consequences of her indecision. Both 
in the book and on the jacket cover, Emily is portrayed as a free-spirited 
Independent Woman; in fact she is evasive (as isolated in water from adult 
realities as a baby in a womb) and manipulative (she says she loves Berry "not 
because it was true, but because she knew it would give her a foothold in 
whatever came next"). Steinke might have passed judgment on Emily through her 
16-year-old son Eddie, but he never resolves his feelings about her life-style, 
vociferously defending her against her ex-lovers at one point ("She's better 
than all of you!"), but seeming uncertain moments later: "Eddie was leaning 
against the cottage, sliding down like a water drop on glass, his arms wrapped 
around himself." 
</P>
<P>
In general, Steinke raises many provocative issues, but leaves most 
undeveloped, from the erotic tension suggested between Emily and Eddie (Eddie 
speaks to Emily in a voice "as clear and deep in the dark as a lover's," while 
Emily is jealous of Eddie's girlfriend) to the trauma experienced by Eddie and 
his girlfriend when they are forced to drown a dying horse in the ocean (this 
grim coming-of-age, never mentioned again, doesn't change their character in 
any apparent way). "Up Through the Water" also has some stylistic problems, 
such as a frequently changing point of view: The story's protagonist is 
supposedly Eddie, but Steinke, clearly more comfortable with probing women's 
thoughts, shifts to a female point of view whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
Steinke is often compelling when exploring women's thoughts, creating passages 
credible enough to compensate for the blurry relationships between her 
characters. Reflecting on her childhood, for instance, Emily remembers how she 
walked to a rabbit cage one day and saw "the mother rabbit slouching over, 
showing her nipples, a baby rabbit attached to each one. Off to the side, there 
had been a dead one covered with a dozen flies. . . . And she'd stood there at 
six or seven, her hands climbing into her shirt for her own nipples. This is 
me, she thought, and turned her head up to the sky."

AN AUTUMN STORY, BY TOMMASO LANDOLFI,TRANSLATED FROM THE ITALIAN BY JOACHIM 
NEUGROSCHEL (ERIDANOS PRESS: $20, CLOTH; $11, PAPER; 145 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tommaso Landolfi occupies an odd place in modern Italian literature as one of 
its most admired and least read writers. He has the reputation of being a 
"writer's writer," most of whose novels and short stories are out of print 
despite the high praise of authors as distinguished as novelist Italo Calvino 
and poet Eugenio Montale. "An Autumn Story" -- one of Landolfi's last books, 
written just four years before his death in 1979 -- makes it easy to understand 
why he has sparked the enthusiasm of the few but not of the many. 
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning of this short novel one has the impression of entering 
an extremely strange and yet familiar literary universe. It is a dark and 
stormy night, the nameless protagonist, a fugitive from war, comes upon a 
lonely aristocratic mansion guarded by two fierce hounds, with no human 
inhabitants in sight. After breaking into the house, he meets its solitary 
owner, an old but ferocious nobleman who reluctantly allows him to stay the 
night. The narrator prolongs his visit as he finds himself increasingly drawn 
in by the sense of mystery in this enormous, largely abandoned manor house. The 
evasiveness of his host, the strange sounds within the house, the seemingly 
endless labyrinth of musty, cobwebbed rooms and an alluring portrait of a 
beautiful woman over the fireplace take hold of the protagonist's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the background is clearly the German occupation of Italy at the end of 
World War II, Landolfi keeps the circumstances as vague as possible in order to 
create an atmosphere of timelessness. The language is lavishly ornate with an 
old-fashioned, musty quality not unlike the fading, mildewing wallpaper of the 
mansion itself. We are not really in this world at all but in the verbal world 
of the gothic novel, of Edgar Allen Poe or of Nikolai Gogol (whom Landolfi 
translated into Italian). There are many superficial resemblances to Poe's "The 
Fall of the House of Usher" -- the lone aristocrat, a horrible family secret, 
the crumbling mansion and the baroque language. 
</P>
<P>
One night the narrator awakes convinced that someone is standing over him, 
breathing; but when he reaches for a match, his room is empty. The following 
day he decides to search the house, something his host has strictly forbidden 
him to do. Exploring, he finds evidence of a woman living hidden in the house, 
a woman who appears to wear the same clothes as the one in the old portrait 
above the fireplace. Risking death, the protagonist follows the owner when he 
retires at night and watches him perform a bizarre religious-satanic rite 
through which he raises the spirit of the dead woman from out of the fire. When 
the narrator screams in terror, the specter vanishes. In the struggle that 
ensues between the two men, the old man swoons in a fatal stroke. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonist flees but cannot help returning a few days later. He finds the 
woman from the portrait -- except that she is young, beautiful and very much 
human. She explains that she is the daughter of the old man and the woman in 
the painting and has lived as her father's captive for her entire life. The 
narrator and the young woman fall in love but when members of the invading army 
arrive she is raped and killed before his eyes. And so the narrator ends up 
like a younger version of the old man, tied irrevocably to the crumbling 
mansion by a powerful, impossible passion for a dead woman. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the course of this bizarre tale, the novel degenerates from an 
alluring story of imagination into a kind of gothic melodrama. Landolfi is at 
his best when he is conjuring the as-yet-unknown mysteries of the house with 
its noises and dark passageways, but when he brings the plot to its climax the 
fascination of his spell seems to break just as the specter of the woman 
vanishes at the narrator's scream. 
</P>
<P>
But "An Autumn Story" is not as silly as its plot would make one believe. In 
fact there is something peculiarly modern to this apparently old-fashioned 
tale: Landolfi seems to be self-consciously creating a purely verbal universe, 
which has no more reality than the feverish incantation that the old man 
recites to invoke the spirit of his dead wife. 
</P>
<P>
Landolfi, an archaic modernist, uses the conventions of the gothic novel for 
rather esoteric purposes. His mixing of genres and his belief in the hypnotic 
power of language are perhaps what attracted a modernist like Calvino. For the 
same reason, however, Landolfi is an odd, hybrid writer, who defies easy 
classification, making him a kind of literary fish out of water, unlikely to 
attract a wide audience.

CHICKEN SHACK (THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT); 
</P>
<P>
A NIGHTMARISH SALON FOR ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS OFFERS TELEVISION ART, JUNKYARD 
LITTER AND CINEMATIC ILLUSIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The exact location of the Chicken Shack is a guarded secret. To get there, you 
have to know somebody who knows somebody. 
</P>
<P>
But once you've been inside, you become part of the family. 
</P>
<P>
So when you walk in, stop by the costume room to dress in colorful jackets and 
a fireman's hat. Next, scurry through the fluorescent tunnel. Step into the 
main room, the dark one, and pick up a musical instrument. Play, even if you 
can't. Create some art. Read a book. Lounge on the patio, in the shadow of 
Greek columns. 
</P>
<P>
Know that you are probably being watched. Much of what happens at the Shack is 
videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
Simply stated, this place is a huge chicken coop in the back yard of a San 
Fernando Valley home. The structure has been gutted and rebuilt as a 
nightmarish salon where artists and musicians hang out. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't adequately explain the Shack. Try . . . an over-sized 
children's clubhouse filled with props from B horror films . . . a maze of 
rooms where static plays on broken televisions . . . a cross between 
Disneyland's "It's a Small World" and the lyrics of Jefferson Airplane's "White 
Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
With its careful attention to television art, junkyard litter and cinematic 
illusions, this is a quintessential Los Angeles invention. The Shack also is 
most likely illegal by building-code standards. If city inspectors discovered 
the place, they would probably shut it down. Thus, secrecy about the address. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Shangri-La, hidden away in the Tibetan mountains," said Lynn 
Coleman, a Woodland Hills painter. "You walk in and you're immediately 
transported into a different frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The Shack was built, and is still being built, by Kilgore Bohorquez. 
</P>
<P>
Bohorquez, who also goes by the names Steve and Dirt, has been a plumber, 
fisherman and itinerant surfer. About 15 years ago, he decided that he was an 
artist and set out to construct an artwork big enough to inhabit. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea for building this was to have a place for people to 
congregate," said the boyish 39-year-old. "I invited some people I knew. After 
a while, they started inviting their friends." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoons, 20 or 30 guests will drift in for a barbecue. Some are 
well-known -- a successful Los Angeles artist, or a musician who used to play 
with REO Speedwagon. Poets, sculptors, cartoonists and amateur film makers 
round out the gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime parties at the Shack draw larger crowds. Most of these parties have 
themes -- perhaps everyone will play music, or the guests might make a group 
film. 
</P>
<P>
And people drop by on their own. On one day, a UCLA film student arrives to 
shoot in the patio. On another, artist Craig Stecyk stops by to take 
photographs for his upcoming exhibit at the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
You might expect to find this beatnik scene in New York or San Francisco. 
Steven Lavine, president of CalArts, said it sounds like the coffeehouses of 
Budapest and the cafes of Vienna, places where artists gathered in years past. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of thing is really significant; it's one of the most exciting things 
that can happen in the arts," said Joy Silverman, executive director at Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. "That's where real creativity takes place. 
The things that happen are more spontaneous." 
</P>
<P>
The Shack's surroundings belie such promise. The neighborhood is old. You can't 
see the Shack from the street, only the house in front with its neglected lawn. 
Around back is a quarter-acre yard marked by piles of beer bottles, weathered 
lumber and rusted plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
"These are my art supplies," Bohorquez said. "Basically it's stuff that you can 
find walking down any alley." 
</P>
<P>
The Shack -- a simple wood building -- fills half the back yard. Often visitors 
are greeted at the front door by a man wearing a fez, a high school band jacket 
and red leather pants. Fake blood drips from his ears, eyes and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I am Dr. Fez," he says. "Welcome to the Chicken Shack." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fez leads you through a tunnel-like entryway where everything is painted 
fluorescent. Radio static blares from hidden speakers. Wires and tubes dangle 
from above. 
</P>
<P>
To one side, through a hidden passage-way, lies the dressing room. Straight 
ahead, at the end of the tunnel, is a door to the main room, a sort of 
underworld cocktail lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Television monitors fill this room with gray, flickering light. Three small 
stages, equipped with conga drums, guitars and amplifiers, await the musically 
inclined. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the action takes place here. 
</P>
<P>
Jam sessions run all afternoon and into the evening as professional musicians 
play next to the tone-deaf. Several musicians play for an hour, take a break 
and are replaced by others. Much of the videotaping takes place in the main 
room as well. At one party, Bohorquez filmed while Dr. Fez walked around as 
Mexican Baby Man, an infant in diapers and a sombrero. 
</P>
<P>
"The more flamboyant people were trying hard to be artsy and get in the video. 
The rest of us were in the background," recalled Lonnie Lloyd, who draws story 
boards for Disney cartoons. "We had all these instruments made of old, rusty 
car parts and we would bang them in unison. We just kept playing, banging, 
making our own music." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Adjoining the main room is a video-editing room (where party footage is being 
spliced into a film) and a well-stocked library. Finally, out the back door is 
a patio bordered by oil drums on one side and a dilapidated, 1949 "Woody" 
station wagon on the other. At the center of the area, Bohorquez is working on 
a sculpture that can be climbed like a tree. 
</P>
<P>
The patio is a favorite spot for discussing art, drinking beer and listening to 
music. A few people stopped by on a recent afternoon. When a visitor began 
taking photographs, everyone donned Mexican wrestling masks. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the grounds, nothing is as it seems. The jagged sheet glass on the 
floor of the tunnel is a piece of clear plastic. The boulders on the patio, 
like the Greek columns, are movie props that Bohorquez brought home from film 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great tool for breaking down your inhibitions, kind of like 
drugs used to be," said Coleman, the painter. "The people are just as bizarre 
as the surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Creating this environment costs little: The stuff is junk or is donated. A 
salesman friend brings tile samples, which form odd patterns in the floor. 
Someone always has a spare broken television. Another person finds a great deal 
on 10 truckloads of crushed blacktop, which Bohorquez uses to cover the dirt in 
the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"People get hooked on the Shack and they start to contribute," Bohorquez said. 
"They say, 'I have something that is worthless to me, but it would be perfect 
here.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Chicken Shack is Bohorquez's third attempt at creating a full-scale, 
art-environment hangout. The first time, property owners kicked him out. The 
second time -- in his mother's garage -- building inspectors stumbled onto the 
place and made him dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
Purely by luck, Bohorquez and his girlfriend, Karen Reynolds, landed at the 
Shack. This version of Bohorquez's dream is six years old. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Dr. Fez owns the property and lives in the front house. Dr. 
Fez speaks in single-sentence, semi-sensical outbursts, so it is unclear 
exactly who he is, what he does or why he invited Bohorquez and Reynolds to 
live with him. They stay in a fixed-up garage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual," Reynolds said of the couple's life style. "It's just our 
circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Bohorquez and Reynolds work occasionally, designing sets for low-budget movies. 
The majority of their time is spent on the Shack. Bohorquez will pick something 
from a junk pile and make something of it. "I try to keep my work subconscious, 
spontaneous," he said. He'll get halfway through a piece, put it aside and pick 
it up months later when suddenly there is a need for it. 
</P>
<P>
Bohorquez is working on a film with Dr. Fez. They have accumulated 140 hours of 
tape, but the plot remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shack continues to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pass an old painting in a trash dump and you can't decide if it's 
ugly or beautiful or just strange, that's the kind of thing you drag out to the 
Shack and contribute it," said Slim Evans, drummer for the now-defunct band 
Rank and File. "There are Valley-surf-tropical-Hollywood-Mexican influences 
with a Tiki consciousness in there too." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's fitting that this place found a home in the heart of the San 
Fernando Valley. Bohorquez said the extravagance of his artistic experiment 
plays well against the Valley's suburban backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
"If any place needs it, the Valley does," Bohorquez said. "The Valley has such 
a bad rap as being a cultural wasteland . . . and deservedly so." 
</P>
<P>
One day, if Bohorquez can manage it, art will fill the entire back yard of this 
property, along with a guest cottage for visitors and water-filled canals. The 
Shack will become a Watts Towers of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, everything here is evolving," Bohorquez said. "I'm just not sure 
where it's evolving to." 
</P>

THEATER NOTEBOOK: GIVING INTIMATE VOICE TO 'OTHER' LIVES AFFECTED BY AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Kearns and AIDS-related theater -- the two are rapidly becoming 
synonymous. And for now, at least, that's OK with Kearns. "I feel a tremendous 
peace and serenity doing this work -- because I'm doing something," said the 
Los Angeles actor-director. "Also, there's a certain joy in taking 
responsibility for your life -- as an artist and a gay person and someone who's 
been heartbroken." 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Kearns (whose touring repertoire includes "Dream Man" 
and "The Truth is Bad Enough" -- which has played locally and across Europe) 
figures he's done "probably ten AIDS pieces, mostly through the experience of a 
gay white man, because that's what I am, and most of the people I've lost. But 
finally I got tired, not of the subject, but telling that tale. I felt it was 
my responsibility to look at the others." 
</P>
<P>
Those others -- the disenfranchised and outcast of our society -- come to life 
in "Intimacies," a collection of character portraits opening this weekend and 
playing through June at the Highways performance space in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The one-man show (directed by Kelly Hill, with original music by Darien Martus) 
presents six very different characters, all suffering from AIDS: deranged 
Denny, a black street hooker named Big Red, "Perfect Patrick" from West 
Hollywood, a heterosexual junkie/street kid named Rusty, Mary (who believes 
AIDS is God's punishment) and Phoenix, now blind and living under the Hollywood 
Freeway -- "full of sweetness and hope." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Denny character that first sparked Kearns' imagination. "I was in 
New York a year ago, down in the subway, and there was a guy in a hospital 
gown, with blood splattered all over it. He appeared to be gay -- and he 
appeared to be demented. But he also seemed to be having the time of his life." 
A few months later, touring in San Francisco, Kearns was drawn to the sight of 
the city's prostitutes, wondering "how they survived this whole AIDS thing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear something's about AIDS, people think it's going to be 
depressing," Kearns said. "But most of these characters have a lot of humor. 
They're surviving by their wits. This piece is open and light. It's also a 
reaction not only to gay theater's response to AIDS, but the media's response. 
It's easy for a good-looking white male to be heard. But these people are not 
going be in 'People' or on 'Nightline.' Their voices are not taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, the actor hopes, audiences will listen to him. But he makes it clear 
he's only speaking for himself -- not the gay world. "If I thought about my 
responsibility to the community, I'd go crazy," he said. "I always thought of 
this as a responsibility to myself, my instincts, my feelings. I also believe 
an actor needs to address social issues. The fact that I'm a gay white male and 
AIDS is here has just accelerated that belief." 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for a role model beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm flattered by the idea," he admitted. "But the truth is that a lot of 
material in this piece -- if you broke it apart -- would not be considered 
politically correct by some gay activists. At this point, I don't think art can 
be politically correct. We've proven we can be the good boys," preaching 
monogamy and safe sex. "I don't want to do that anymore. Anyway," Kearns said 
with a laugh, "I don't think I personally have to worry about being perceived 
as a good boy." 
</P>
<P>

BELIEVE IT: 'GEE I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S FISH' IS A CAJUN DELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're way in the outback here, nowhere near the San Fernando Valley's main 
restaurant hunting grounds. We're in deep Van Nuys, to be precise; so deep, in 
fact, we're just a couple of blocks from my old grammar school. Let me tell 
you, never in my wildest dreams as a flag monitor did I imagine that one day 
there would be a Cajun restaurant in the old neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, there is one, though this fact is far from being self-evident. 
The sign in the window reads Gee I Can't Believe It's Fish, which is not only 
an awkward name (what would you want to call this place for short?) but 
unfortunately leads a Californian to expect seafood kebab Polynesian served 
with baked potato and melon slice garnish in some environment rife with brass 
compasses and phony portholes. 
</P>
<P>
Gee I Can't Believe It's Fish really is Cajun, though, and with no decor to 
speak of, just a little storefront place run by a brother-and-sister team that 
does mostly takeout business for clients who often boast of how far they drove 
to have a taste of the dishes from back home. There's jambalaya. There's red 
beans and rice. There's gumbo. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's gumbo until they run out, which tends to be early, and I've never 
had a shot at it. I can report that the jambalaya is excellent, not too dry, 
the rice moist with slightly hot and tart tomato and celery sauce, enriched not 
only with chicken and hot links but eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Mostly there's fish, boneless, excellently fried in crisp cornmeal breading. 
Basically it's a repertoire of catfish, snapper, oysters and shrimp. You can 
get a catfish sandwich or a shrimp or oyster loaf on a French roll (the night I 
had it, they boasted of having Louisiana oysters). You can also get fish or 
shrimp dinners, which include red beans and rice and, for a buck extra, they'll 
blacken anything for you. (Well, probably they won't blacken the shrimp or the 
oysters.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the byproducts of being a great fish-frying place is that Gee I Can't 
Believe It's Fish makes great hush puppies. These little balls of cornmeal 
mixed with onions have a good, grainy texture, and they're addictive (the 
restaurant knows it too -- they have a habit of throwing a couple in front of 
you while you're waiting for your main course). There are 10 of them in an 
order, and they go fast, though they're on the dry side; another shrewd move on 
the restaurant's part, probably. I'll bet the hush puppies are good for 
soft-drink sales. 
</P>
<P>
The other side dishes are not quite in the same league with the hush puppies. 
The red beans and rice, a soulful rather than a grand dish, does have very good 
beans. The coleslaw is simple and fresh. But I find the collards, for instance, 
pretty dull, and the macaroni and cheese is not as cheesy as its bright yellow 
color suggests. 
</P>
<P>
One reason why you can't believe that it's fish is that sometimes it isn't. 
There are broiled ribs and pork chops too. The ribs are the meaty country-style 
cut, sprinkled with pepper, but I find the Cajun pork chops meatier and 
sweeter, and more tender too. There's only so much you can do with ribs if you 
don't have a barbecue pit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The best of the meat dishes is, unfortunately, available only on Wednesdays and 
fits more easily into the category of Southern cooking than what we think of as 
Louisiana. It's the smothered pork chops, in a rich gravy flavored with celery 
and bell pepper (and a little hot pepper). This comes on rice and wonderful 
black-eyed peas. You may stagger a little bit rising from the table. 
</P>
<P>
Which may make you glad there's not much in the way of dessert. The sweet 
potato pie is OK (the crust on the one I had was overdone), the peach cobbler 
-- with nutmeg as well as cinnamon and clove flavoring -- a little better. 
</P>
<P>
After I ate at Gee I Can't Believe It's Fish, I took a sentimental journey back 
to my old grammar school. It had changed. For one thing, all the buildings had 
somehow gotten smaller. 
</P>
<P>
For another, restaurants had appeared all around it, a Thai restaurant on one 
corner and a whimsical hot dog stand run by a lawyer on the other. Let me tell 
you something; when I was flag monitor, we didn't have it this good. The only 
food you could get around here was a Three Musketeers from the machine at the 
gas station. And now you don't even have to go half a mile to find blackened 
fish. Blackened! 
</P>
<P>
Kids have it soft these days. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: hush puppies, $2.50; jambalaya, $7.50; red snapper, $6.95; 
smothered pork chops (Wednesday only), $7.95; peach cobbler, $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee I Can't Believe It's Fish, 14066 Vanowen St., Van Nuys. (818) 988-3474. 
Open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, 1 to 9 p.m. Sundays. No 
alcoholic beverages. Parking lot. No credit cards accepted. Dinner for two,

OPERATORS CHARGED BUT CLINICS ARE OPEN ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after seven people were accused of operating four clinics with bogus 
medical personnel, two of the clinics were open and attracting a steady stream 
of patients in the heavily immigrant Westlake district Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Young Latino families, carrying small babies and trailing children in frilly 
white dresses, climbed the steps to the Santa Ines and Bonnie Brae medical 
clinics at 2033 W. 7th St. Several of those questioned said they had not heard 
of the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
That may change soon. "That situation will be addressed next week," said 
Michael Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Not Disclosed 
</P>
<P>
He declined to be specific, but indicated that there will be an attempt to shut 
down the clinics. The likely avenue for doing so, he indicated, will be a civil 
complaint. "The enforcement action is not concluded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics were treating up to 1,000 people a week, according to City Atty. 
James K. Hahn. But he said it appears that only two of the medical personnel 
were licensed in any health care profession. The rest of the staff -- 15 people 
-- "were not licensed to provide the general health care they were giving," 
Hahn said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics advertised treatments that included X-rays, therapy and accident 
care. One young man entered the Santa Ines clinic on crutches. A spokeswoman 
for the operators, who refused to identify herself, denied access to the clinic 
to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no comment until after the trial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the clinics, San Cristobal Medical Clinic in Boyle Heights and La 
Familia Health Center in Wilmington, were closed Saturday. Green graffiti 
reading "ick" was sprayed on the glass window of the San Cristobal clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began in 1983 
</P>
<P>
Among those charged in the case is Salvador Cano, 38, of Santa Ana, president 
of Santa Ines Medical Enterprises Inc., the corporate owner of the clinics, 
which began operating in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Also accused was Cano's wife, Enriqueta Silva, 40, a doctor, who worked at the 
clinic; James E. Mack, 68, of Studio City, a disbarred attorney; Kelly S. 
Klatt, 36, of San Pedro, a Los Angeles police officer on disability leave; 
Klatt's wife, Samantha, 37; Alan B. Miller, 38, of Van Nuys, administrator of 
the clinics, and Frank Hegyi, 47, of Los Angeles, another clinic administrator. 
</P>
<P>
They are charged in a 74-count indictment with practicing medicine without a 
license, forging a prescription, falsely advertising as a doctor, and other 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
They also are charged with violations of the state Labor Code and Unemployment 
Insurance Code, stemming from the alleged exploitation of their work force. 
Employees were required to work 10- to 12-hour shifts without any days off, 
according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Perez took his 2-month-old son, Milton, to the clinic Saturday. But he 
left after a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"They no have doctors," the 30-year-old father said in halting English. He 
shrugged and disappeared into the morning throng along Alvarado Street.

NURSING REGISTRIES BOOMING; SOME SAY TREND IS UNHEALTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 6:45 a.m., and the medical reinforcements are arriving at Kaiser 
Permanente's towering Panorama City hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen nurses and attendants in sensible shoes and collarless white 
shirts, part of a small army of temporary medical workers brought in each day 
to staff Southern California hospitals during an ongoing nursing crisis, sign 
in near the bustling emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"We need them to function," said Anita Zermeno, operating room nursing 
supervisor. But while most of the temporaries are capable, Zermeno says, some 
have such limited abilities that she must give them easy assignments, such as 
assisting in hysterectomies. She also orders a staff nurse to watch over them, 
which she says is galling since a temporary nurse is paid at least $5 an hour 
more than a staff nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"Here comes someone getting the big bucks and all they can do is a 
hysterectomy," Zermeno said. "Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40% of Staff 
</P>
<P>
A national nursing shortage has made a number of medical facilities reliant on 
agencies, commonly known as registries, that supply temporary nurses and 
attendants. In some hospitals at times, 40% of the nursing staff is from 
outside registries, while the figure is as high as 80% in some nursing homes, 
health-care specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospital officials now see the registries, once considered a solution to 
staff shortages, as a part of the problem. Critics say registries are competing 
with institutions for nursing school graduates and are draining off staff 
nurses by offering pay that hospitals cannot match. 
</P>
<P>
An association of state nursing homes grew so frustrated that it persuaded 
Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro) to introduce legislation that would 
put the agencies out of business -- even though without them many hospitals and 
nursing homes would have trouble staffing their facilities. Felando put the 
bill, sponsored by the California Assn. of Health Facilities, on hold after the 
registries rose up in protest. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, they would not exist," Donna Robinson, associate 
director of nursing at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, said of the 
registries. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the nursing shortage was brought on by a changing business climate 
that has made traditionally male-dominated careers more attractive to women who 
ordinarily might choose nursing as a vocation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some nurses are deciding against the long hours and pressure 
of working on a hospital staff. If they go to work for a registry, they can 
pick and choose from the jobs offered. They can turn down a job if they don't 
like the hours or the hospital. If they feel like taking a vacation, they can 
just go. 
</P>
<P>
They also earn more money because hospitals pay premium rates to the registries 
for skilled nursing personnel, although the difference in wages is partly 
offset by the health benefits offered to hospital staffs. 
</P>
<P>
A registered nurse is paid $15 to $17 an hour to work in a nursing home, while 
registries may pay upward of $27 an hour. Olive View, a public hospital run by 
Los Angeles County, pays $573.50 to the registry for a nurse to work a single, 
12-hour shift on the weekend in critical care. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business is doing very, very well now," said Pat Donohoe, vice president 
of business development for NSI Home Health Care. 
</P>
<P>
The industry as a whole is booming, according to health-care observers. 
Hospital nursing supervisors say they get several calls a week from new 
registries springing up. "It's a gas war out there," Penny Hammer, nursing 
supervisor at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, said of the competitive 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Figures on the usage of registry nurses at hospitals demonstrate the importance 
of registries to the delivery of health care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Costs 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986-87 fiscal year, Los Angeles County paid $1 million for temporary 
nurses at its six public hospitals, including Olive View. Last fiscal year, the 
figure was $3.3 million. This year, it is expected to soar to $12 million, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California's teaching hospitals have seen a similar growth 
pattern. UCLA Medical Center spent $2.4 million for registry nurses in the last 
nine months of the 1986-87 fiscal year, according to figures gathered by the 
California Nurses Assn. That amount nearly tripled last fiscal year, to $6.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
All this has put the nurse who is looking for work in an advantageous position. 
"Every registry in town is fighting to get that nurse," said Carmen Baker, 
regional director of STAT Nurses Registry, which has an office in Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The increasingly competitive market among registries has caused some of them to 
begin offering benefits and even bonuses and vacations to nurses to encourage 
them to sign up. Several agencies have resorted to hiring nurses over the 
phone, without checking their credentials, some hospital officials say. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to problems. Hammer said one agency sent a nurse attendant who was 
unable to take a patient's temperature. The attendant, it turned out, had never 
worked at a hospital before. "I called the registry. They had not checked her 
references. They just put her to work," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Errors 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, Hammer said, nurses have showed up in clothes so dirty that 
they had to be sent home to change. One temporary nurse administered a 
potentially fatal dose of medication to a patient, Hammer said. The patient 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
And another nurse assistant at Valley Presbyterian cursed a patient who was 
complaining of pain. "She said, in effect, 'It's in your head.' She fired 
four-letter words off" at the patient and at the hospital and walked off the 
job, Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism, however, nursing supervisors agree that the vast 
majority of registry nurses are skilled professionals who know their jobs as 
well as most staff nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"We screen very carefully," Baker said. "The nurses that we send out are highly 
qualified." Before sending a nurse on a job, STAT checks to see that the nurse 
has at least one year of hospital experience, as well as experience in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and a nursing license. 
</P>
<P>
"The mama and papa registries are the ones that are hurting us," Baker said. 
"When we refuse a nurse, they sign up with the mamas and papas who are working 
out of their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Chip Baker, director of human resources for ARA Living Centers, a large nursing 
home company in California, said there are many "fly-by-night" agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horror Stories 
</P>
<P>
Jean Orr, chief of the state Bureau of Personnel Services in Sacramento, has 
heard the horror stories. Although her office is supposed to regulate the 
industry, the vast majority of registries are not required to file papers with 
her, or are operating outside the law. Only 50 agencies are registered with her 
office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find 50 in any community of Southern California right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By law, nursing agencies must register with her office only if they require 
employees to pay them a fee to work. Many are paid directly by hospitals. Then 
there are others that operate without required licenses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got white shoes and a clean white shirt, you can be a nurse's aide 
and open a registry," she said. "There is a whole unregulated industry out 
there. No one really has a handle on it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospitals Blamed 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of Rose Ann De Moro, assistant director for collective bargaining 
of the California Nurses Assn., the hospitals have only themselves to blame for 
the situation. Hospitals would be better able to hang on to staff nurses if 
they paid them more and gave them more freedom in setting their hours, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals are making registries a very appealing place to go," she said. "It's 
not like registries are out there trying to overthrow the hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Now nurses are feeling their power. "You're seeing a whole different kind of 
nurse these days," said Shirley Hamill, associate director for the Western 
United States of Upjohn Health Care Services, which operates a nursing agency. 
This new crop of nurses is more assertive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing agencies "give them another option to keep them in the hospitals," said 
William York, executive director of AMI Health Care Staffing, a nursing agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Worsens 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for health-care facilities say just the reverse is happening -- 
nurses are being drained from the hospitals. Registries have "worsened the 
situation," said David Helmsin, a spokesman for the California Assn. of Health 
Facilities, which represents nursing homes. Registries "are like vultures 
almost, feeding on a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
The agencies have not only forced hospitals to compete with them for nurses, 
but with one another, critics say. Hospitals with bad reputations, or in poor 
areas, may find it difficult to locate even a temporary nurse on some days. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson at Olive View said it can take as many as 44 phone calls to find a 
nurse. Then, "it's not unusual for a registry to call two hours before" a shift 
begins "and say, 'Nurse Jane Doe cannot work for you.' We do a little checking 
and we find Nurse Doe is at Northridge" Hospital Medical Center, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is magnified in nursing homes, which run on slim financial 
margins because they depend more heavily on government reimbursement. They 
cannot afford to pay nurses what acute-care hospitals pay. As a result, keeping 
staff becomes difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Staff 
</P>
<P>
Nursing home officials said some facilities are run almost entirely by 
employees of registries, which may change daily. A nurse on the floor only one 
day may not notice signs that a patient is deteriorating, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires three hours of nursing care per patient a day. It also 
requires that a registered nurse be on duty at all times at larger facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing homes have trouble attracting required ancillary staff, which include 
nurse's aides, and hire registry personnel at up to $20 an hour for jobs that 
normally pay $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a strain on budgets. The cost of registry employees for ARA's 30 
California nursing homes doubled from 1987 to 1988, and there is a chance that 
it will double again this year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get it under control," said Kathy Daigle, ARA spokeswoman. "This 
eats away at other patient-care areas." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has authorized the use of an agency specializing in nurses 
from the British Isles and Australia. Such nurses are 30% to 35% cheaper than 
nurses available through the local registries, said Kevin Stewart-Magee, 
director of marketing for Nursing Management Services (USA) in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has moved to reduce the use of registries by increasing the pay for staff 
nurses who work extra shifts and by aggressively recruiting nurses from other 
parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
ARA is fighting the registry habit, holding biweekly meetings with officials of 
nursing homes that use a large number of registry workers. The officials are 
encouraged to look for permanent workers, to kick their expensive dependence on 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called 'Registry Anonymous,' " Daigle said. 
</P>

comes someone getting the big bucks and all they can do is a hysterectomy. Give 
me a break," says Anita Zermeno, Kaiser Permanente operating room supervisor.

DAY LABORER FINDS A 'GOLD MINE' AT VAN NUYS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marcos Chicuate Castro toes the curb, tracking the whizzing cars with a 
seasoned eye, flinging his right arm out when a truck passes or he catches a 
driver's attention. 
</P>
<P>
A white GMC truck pulls into the gas station across the street, and the driver 
lets out a shrill whistle. Castro and half a dozen other men sprint across the 
street to where the truck is parked. 
</P>
<P>
Someone else gets the nod, and Castro crosses back to his spot at Kester Avenue 
near Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. It is 8 a.m., and he has been on the 
lookout for a job for about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Castro comes as often as six days a week to the site, which laborers call Las 
Piedras, "The Rocks." Strangers pick him up and take him to building sites, 
homes and warehouses to garden, clean or paint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hinges on Variables 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other day laborers on Los Angeles streets, whether he gets 
picked up depends on a myriad of variables -- such as the weather, the 
construction business, and his audacity and speed. 
</P>
<P>
His earnings have ranged from $100 to $250 a week. But despite the fact that 
most people would have a hard time living on such meager wages, the 25-year-old 
Castro, in the United States illegally, is upbeat: "It's a gold mine here. If 
you're patient, you'll be able to get something," he said in Spanish through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sleeps on the floor of a cramped apartment, has no car and longs 
for his family in Mexico, jobs are more plentiful in the San Fernando Valley 
than where he came from. 
</P>
<P>
Castro is tidy in black jeans, with two gold chains tucked inside a red fleecy 
pullover jacket; his mustache is trimmed beneath his baseball cap. He smiles 
sincerely when he has a job prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Gumption, he said, is the key. As other workers told him when they introduced 
him to the day-labor system, "Whatever they tell you they need, you say you 
have experience doing it. When you get to the job, you watch the other workers, 
and you just do it." 
</P>
<P>
He looks at a woman who's driven up to a liquor store and market along Kester, 
takes a hesitant step toward her, gets no response and retreats. "Sometimes 
it's better if you approach them," he said, because employers would be 
embarrassed to beckon someone who turns out not to be offering work. 
</P>
<P>
A woman about 55 years old pulls up in a white Buick. She rolls down her window 
and smiles; the men, including Castro, surround her car. Three jump into the 
back seat. "Just need three," she protests cheerily to the others pressed 
against her car. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 10 prospective employers stop for workers on this day, Castro is 
not lucky enough to land a job. He calls it quits about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
But Castro is not worried. A few weeks ago, a North Hollywood resident who owns 
a refrigeration supply company hired him. Since then, he has been assembling 
refrigeration products and painting the man's house for a few days each week. 
If employers like your work the first time, "sometimes they'll come back and 
look for you," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by a breakup with his fiancee and dreams of seeing "Disneylandia," 
Castro left the fishing village of Sinaloa and crossed into the United States 
in May, 1986. In Mexico, he was training to work for a fishing cooperative and 
lived with his fisherman father, housewife mother and six siblings in a 
four-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
He took a bus to Tijuana, where a coyote led him and three other men across the 
border to San Ysidro about 3 a.m. He and the others hid from the searchlights 
of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service helicopters as they made their 
way north. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men had a friend in Panorama City, who let Castro stay at her home 
and invited him to help her sell marijuana. Castro said he did not know about 
day-labor opportunities and had looked for work, but employers kept demanding 
documentation. He said he finally agreed to peddle marijuana on Blythe Street. 
He made $200 to $500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Money Home 
</P>
<P>
He sent money home, telling his parents that he worked in a restaurant -- and 
feeling guilty about the lie. In the summer of 1987, he was arrested by Los 
Angeles police, who found 6.2 grams of marijuana in his possession. Out on 
$5,000 bail, he returned to Mexico with a duffel bag of dresses, Reebok shoes 
and toys for his brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
In his village, though, he hankered for the United States. Los Angeles "is more 
of a rat race, but you can get what you want faster. . . . Right away, you can 
get all the things you need -- TV, apartment." 
</P>
<P>
He tried to cross back to the United States, got caught, tried again and 
succeeded in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Still guilt-ridden about lying to his parents, he said he decided to give up 
drug dealing. New friends took him to Victory and Kester. His first day, he got 
a job mixing stucco at a Studio City house. 
</P>
<P>
But in November, police recognized him on Blythe Street and hauled him in. He 
pleaded guilty to his prior felony drug charge, possessing marijuana for sale. 
After serving three months of his sentence, he was released on probation. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction probably blocks any opportunity that Castro might have had to 
live in the United States legally, said Antonio Rodriguez, a lawyer at the 
Latino Community Justice Center in Los Angeles. But even without a criminal 
record, Castro may not have fit into a category that would have made him 
eligible for legal status -- he has no relatives who are permanent residents or 
citizens, is not a farm worker, does not qualify for amnesty and has no 
specialized skill for which there are not enough American workers, Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Castro said he paid $300 to someone he knows as "an attorney," who told him 
it would take five months to obtain citizenship. The man told The Times that he 
was not an attorney but worked for one and refused to give more information. 
His phone has since been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospects Dim 
</P>
<P>
Castro did not seem worried that his prospects for citizenship are dim. He said 
he has paid for his crime and plans to continue going to Las Piedras to seek 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The going rate along the street is $5 an hour, and Castro said he will work for 
less. But he and other workers said men who haven't worked in a few days are 
desperate and will take whatever they can get. 
</P>
<P>
One homeowner, Castro said, wanted two men to clear away the torn-down walls in 
a Ventura Boulevard house that was being remodeled. Once at the house, the 
homeowner said he would pay each man $20 for an 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. workday. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine that? Two dollars an hour," Castro said. The employer refused 
to pay more, drove them back to Kester Avenue in Van Nuys and picked up others, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Unpaid 
</P>
<P>
Castro said he was bilked once, on an asphalt repair job. The foreman said the 
boss would pay, but he never did. Castro said he is owed about $50. But, he 
said, taking the time to pursue the lost wages would mean a day away from the 
street and potential loss of more wages. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not working or looking for work, Castro visits friends, strolls the 
Panorama City Mall or along Broadway downtown, or watches TV at home -- a 
$475-a-month studio apartment in Van Nuys that he shares with an older man 
nicknamed "Tio" (uncle) and two teen-age boys. Castro said the teen-age 
brothers arrived from Ensenada two weeks ago and one of them -- using false 
papers -- recently landed a job. Castro and Tio have been splitting the rent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leftover Clothes 
</P>
<P>
The apartment contains Tio's color TV, which is tuned to a baseball game 
whenever one is on, a few pieces of furniture, Corona beer and Hennessey cognac 
barroom mirrors and worn pans and mismatched dishes in the cupboards. The 
mirrors and some of the kitchenware were donated by some of Castro's employers. 
A Sherman Oaks family gave him leftover clothes, a 10-speed bike and three 
stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
Tio has a twin bed, Castro uses a sleeping bag, and the brothers spread 
blankets on the cream-and-brown carpet. Castro proudly shows a $650 Ingles 
Ahora (English Now) kit in a black briefcase -- cassettes, a Panasonic tape 
player, a bilingual dictionary and workbooks. He and Tio are on Book One, 
learning such phrases as: "Do I drive a car?" "Do we have a map of Florida?" 
and "Elizabeth and I are English ladies." 
</P>
<P>
While the one brother works at a furniture factory, the other brother and Tio 
deliver phone books. The apartment has no phone. It smells of pan-fried pork 
slabs, which the four have eaten for dinner the past two nights. 
</P>
<P>
It is the 10th place that Castro has lived during his nearly three years in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his expenses, Castro said, he usually manages to mail $100 a week to 
his family in Mexico. In the past couple of years, his loved ones have come to 
depend on the money, he said, since the fishing industry has soured and his 
mother has fallen ill and required several operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother's Name 
</P>
<P>
It is hard being away from his family, Castro said. He has bought a gilt-edged 
Bible inscribed with his mother's name to give to her. And he has Mi Madre Es 
Josefa (My mother is Josefa) tattooed on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Castro's North Hollywood employer said he believes in giving illegal aliens a 
chance, despite a prohibition against hiring them in the 1986 Immigration 
Reform and Control Act. But he admitted that he is saving money by hiring 
Castro for $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The man pays Castro in cash every other day. "He's always here on time. He has 
a lot of skills," the man said of Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Describing an American youth he once hired, the man said: "He had gas mileage, 
car allowance and everything, and he was always complaining. 'It's too much 
work, too much driving.' " Castro "doesn't complain," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the INS arrests him, Castro is warned by the employer: "Don't give my 
name."

'REAGAN TRADITION';

<P>
* GOP TO FILE COMPLAINT OVER KORENSTEIN FLYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State GOP officials said Saturday that they will file a formal complaint with 
the California Fair Political Practices Commission over a campaign mailer 
suggesting that Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein, a liberal 
Democrat, is the reelection choice of Reagan Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Burbank, state Republican Chairman Frank Visco said the 
mailer, which featured two pictures of former President Ronald Reagan and used 
the GOP's elephant logo, showed "an outrageous contempt for basic honesty" and 
violated the law as well. 
</P>
<P>
Visco said the mailer by a slate mailing firm called the L.A. Taxpayers 
Alliance violated the state Political Reform Act by failing to include a 
disclaimer stating that the group is not an official political party 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Visco was joined at the news conference by Jerry Horowitz, Korenstein's 
opponent in Tuesday's runoff election for the west San Fernando Valley school 
board seat, and by City Councilman Hal Bernson, a Horowitz supporter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Brazen Dishonesty' 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz called the mailer, sent exclusively to Republicans last week, "a 
last-minute 'hit' piece" and an example of "brazen dishonesty." 
</P>
<P>
Both Visco and Korenstein said the mailer was the work of political consultant 
Fred Heubscher, operator of the alliance. Korenstein said the slate mailing 
firm lists political candidates in mass mailings in return for money. Heubscher 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer called on "West Valley Republicans" to "continue the Reagan 
Tradition of Fiscal Conservatism" by voting for Korenstein and Los Angeles 
Community College District board candidates Rose Ochi and Althea Baker. The 
mailer did not disclose that Korenstein, Ochi and Baker are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer displayed two photographs of a smiling Reagan and gave his address 
so that voters could "warmly welcome" him back to Los Angeles with "a Father's 
Day greeting." 
</P>
<P>
But Korenstein -- a supporter of the nuclear freeze and other liberal causes, 
who paid $1,500 to appear on the mailer -- said Saturday that she had "nothing 
to apologize for" since she did not write the mailer or review it in advance. 
She acknowledged that she did not support Reagan, but said "that's neither here 
nor there." 
</P>
<P>
A similar mailer with Los Angeles City Council candidate Lyle Hall's name on it 
in place of Korenstein's was also sent out by the alliance. Hall, also a 
Democrat, said Saturday night that he did not authorize the mailer and would 
investigate its origin. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein contended that she and other candidates are "held hostage" by slate 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Put On Whoever Pays' 
</P>
<P>
"They will put on whoever pays to get a spot on it," she said. "And if you do 
not take a spot on it, then your opponent takes that spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Our legislators should absolutely stop slate mailers," Korenstein said. "Then 
candidates will not be forced to put their names on." 
</P>
<P>
Republican officials said they may file suit over Heubscher's use of the 
Republican logo, in addition to the complaint they intend to file Monday with 
the Fair Political Practices Commission over lack of a disclaimer. Visco said 
the agency should investigate Heubscher and his L.A. Taxpayers Alliance, as 
well as anyone in the Korenstein campaign who may have had direct involvement 
in the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
The commission can levy financial penalties for violations or can refer them 
for prosecution as criminal misdemeanors, although such prosecutions are rare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slate Mailing 
</P>
<P>
But a Korenstein campaign consultant said he believes that a disclaimer was not 
required on the mailer because of a loophole in the Political Reform Act. One 
section of the law defines a "slate mailer" subject to the disclaimer as "a 
mass mailing which supports or opposes a total of four or more candidates or 
ballot measures." 
</P>
<P>
While saying he did not "want to be defending" Heubscher, Korenstein consultant 
Parke Shelton said the mailer might be exempt since it endorsed only three 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mailer urged Republicans not to vote for Horowitz, bringing to 
four the total of candidates either supported or opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer flap capped a bitter final week of campaigning in which both 
candidates attempted to appeal to conservative voters in what is actually a 
nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Switch 
</P>
<P>
For example, Horowitz, a longtime registered Democrat, re-registered as a 
Republican on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Saturday why he changed his party affiliation, Horowitz said he had 
"always voted conservative" despite being a Democrat. He said that no one had 
suggested that he become a Republican, and that he merely wanted to "clearly 
define my position."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT TO DEATH AFTER RAMMING CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura man was shot to death after he used his vehicle to force another auto 
off a road during a late-night chase through Agoura, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bello, 37, was killed Friday night when he approached the vehicle of 
Thomas J. Barr, 47, of Agoura Hills after forcing it off the road in the 29900 
block of Agoura Road, Deputy Van Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said the incident occurred about 11:20 p.m. after Barr, "in fear of his 
life . . . drove to various parts of Agoura" with Bello in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Bello eventually rammed Barr's vehicle, forcing it off the road, Mosley said. 
When Bello approached Barr's auto, Barr shot Bello, who died at the scene, 
Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
A restraining order had been issued against Bello earlier this year requiring 
him to stay away from Barr, Mosley said. Mosley said he could not elaborate on 
the dispute between the men. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances surrounding this whole thing are part of the investigation," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said Barr was not arrested pending completion of the investigation and 
presentation of the facts to the district attorney's office.

SOCKERS LEAD SERIES, BUT NEWMAN SAYS THEY CAN PLAY EVEN BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ice packs wrapped around battered legs outnumbered the whoops and hollers in 
the Sockers' locker room Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The mood was somewhere between cautious and business-like. 
</P>
<P>
You would think a 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Blast in Game 3 of the Major 
Indoor Soccer League championships would call for some levity, some 
celebration. The Sockers had taken a 2-1 lead in this best-of-seven series with 
a performance that seemed, for the first time in the playoffs, neat and 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Socker Coach Ron Newman, perched before writers who were expecting him to 
praise his players, explained that his team is capable of better. Predictions 
of a series-ending sweep of the games in San Diego were on hold approaching 
Game 4 tonight at 6:05 in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is still campaigning for the underdog billing, though his team led, 4-0, 
at halftime Friday and was never in danger of letting the game slip from its 
clutches. He just wasn't particularly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "I thought we could play better. It was individual efforts that 
got the goals rather than a nice pattern of team play." 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. But the individual efforts indicate the individuals are healthier 
than they have been in quite awhile. Branko Segota returned, thigh heavily 
wrapped to protect a tender hamstring, to score a goal and assist on another. 
He summed up his hamstring's status by saying simply: "It felt pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Brian Quinn, sidelined through much of the season with injuries, had 
his most productive outing of the playoffs, scoring twice and assisting once. 
His second goal, the Sockers' fifth, reduced the possibility of another late 
Blast comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (it) was critical because it gave us a breath when they put in the 
sixth attacker," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, who have scored the first goal in the past five playoff games, 
have difficulty coping with a sixth attacker, evidenced by last-minute 
Baltimore goals in Games 1 and 2. Goalie Victor Nogueira has been steady, 
sometimes spectacular, though his playoff statistics have been damaged slightly 
by what defender Kevin Crow terms "scrappy goals." Definition: goals achieved 
on hustle alone, scored because of a funny bounce or deflection. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore scores often from close range. The key to defending that, Crow says, 
is pressuring away from the goal, preventing the offense from controlling 
possession and tiring the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Any underdog status the Sockers had when the series began probably was erased 
when Baltimore lost its top defender, Bruce Savage. Savage, second behind Crow 
for the MISL defender of the year award, went down with a right ankle sprain in 
Tuesday's game and isn't expected to return. Also missing from the Blast lineup 
Friday was defender Tim Wittman, but he will likely return tonight. 
</P>
<P>
These injuries, coupled with Segota's return, make Baltimore's task 
increasingly difficult here in San Diego, particularly considering the 
advantage the Sockers gain from crowd support. Friday's attendance of 11,484 
was 15th largest in team history. In those 15 games, these hams of the kicking 
industry have lost but once. At home against Baltimore in the playoffs, the 
Sockers are 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Still, nothing is being taken for granted. Defender Ralph Black, with scrapes 
and bruises to show for his aggressive slide tackles, was making that point 
Friday night. He thinks there's a lot more to the Blast than has been displayed 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll see a different Baltimore team out there next game," he said. 
"If we're not up to par, we're going to be in for a tough night." 
</P>
<P>
And nobody admits to thinking about a Socker sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we can be concerned about now is (tonight)," Crow said. "If we 
start looking at the next game, they'll take one from us."

SHOW KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH DAVIS BUT DOESN'T DO IT IN 6-2 PADRE LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The situation called for a consultation. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, fresh off his six-RBI cycle the night before, was at the plate for 
Cincinnati with two outs and two on in the sixth inning of a tie game Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago walked to the mound to talk with starting pitcher 
Eric Show. His advice, he later said, was simple: Keep the ball down and off 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
One pitch later, Davis was triumphantly rounding the bases, his ninth homer 
having easily cleared the wall in left center. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in five games against the Padres and the second night in a 
row, Davis hit a three-run homer against the Padres. This time it led to a 6-2 
victory in front of 35,378 at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, combined with San Francisco's 4-0 victory in Atlanta, dropped the 
Padres 3 1/2 games behind the National League West-leading Giants and kept them 
in fourth, two games in front of the fifth-place Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The pitch Davis hit was neither low nor fast nor away from the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up throwing what turned out to be a mediocre fastball high in the 
strike zone to a guy who can definitely hit a home run," Show said. "I'm not 
sure it was Eric as much as what I gave him. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked a shot at that pitch myself." 
</P>
<P>
Show said he was trying to give Davis a sinkerball, the same pitch Davis 
grounded into a force play in the first. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the (pitch) selection," Show said. "It was the way I threw it and 
who I threw it to." 
</P>
<P>
The pitch was everything Santiago said he told Show to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake, a big one," Santiago said. 
</P>
<P>
Making it worse, Show did it again two batters later. After right fielder Paul 
O'Neill hit a line drive down the right-field line that bounced over the fence 
for a ground-rule double, rookie left fielder Rolando Roomes took what Show 
said was another misplaced sinkerball even deeper to left center to give the 
Reds a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Another mistake pitch," Show said. "Generally speaking, guided sinkers high in 
the strike zone are mediocre pitches. They are hit out of the park more than 
any other pitch I throw." 
</P>
<P>
The homer was Roomes' third since he was called up from the Reds' triple-A team 
in Nashville, Tenn., May 3. Roomes, acquired in an off-season deal with the 
Chicago Cubs, is hitting .364 since joining the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Show got Jeff Reed to fly out to center to end the inning, but he left for a 
pinch hitter in the seventh having allowed six runs on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in a week, Show was foiled in his bid to break Randy Jones' 
team career record of 92 victories by a six-run, six-inning performance. And 
for the second night, Davis had clobbered the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"That is one guy you can't let beat you," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. 
"Don't give him anything to hit, let him walk him." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said the number of teams that have pitched to Jack Clark was an example 
of how to treat Davis. Clark has a league-leading 48 walks. 
</P>
<P>
Show said he considered pitching around Davis but decided against it because of 
his history against him (.259, seven for 27, with three home runs). 
</P>
<P>
"Not with the stuff I had to work with tonight and the way I have handled him 
in the past when I have pitched to him the way I should," Show said. "I did not 
feel threatened by him." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had plenty of chances to score, leaving a runner in scoring position 
in each of the first four innings. But it was the Reds who scored first. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Todd Benzinger opened the fourth with a double that bounced off 
the wall in left center. He moved to third on Show's wild pitch before scoring 
on shortstop Barry Larkin's short fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn came right back to tie the game at 1-1 in the fifth with his third 
home run. The homer was his first off winning starter Rick Mahler (7-5) and his 
first since hitting homers in consecutive games against Atlanta April 10-11. 
</P>
<P>
The ball easily carried over the right-center field fence to the left of the 
375-foot sign. It was Gwynn's fifth homer in Riverfront Stadium, more than he 
has hit any park outside of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The game stayed tied until the sixth, when Davis and Roomes connected off Show 
to give the Reds a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
An inning later with the Reds at bat and one out, a rain shower caused a 
38-minute delay. It was too late to help the Padres, who added their final run 
with the help of four consecutive singles in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
But this was a night when man matched nature's thunder. Asked if he saw any 
lightning during the game, McKeon said: "Only when (Davis) was at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris James, the third baseman/outfielder acquired from Philadelphia Friday 
night, arrived in the Padre clubhouse about 45 minutes before the game. He met 
for about five minutes with Manager Jack McKeon before making a sweep to 
introduce himself to his new teammates. "I told him he doesn't have to worry 
about carrying the team," McKeon said. "I told him to relax and have some fun." 
That has not been easy for James, who has been under pressure in Philadelphia 
since he became the man counted on to take over for recently retired Mike 
Schmidt. James was zero for 31 before the trade, and his average had dropped to 
.207, but James is counting on the change of cities to give him a fresh start. 
He made his first appearance for the Padres as a pinch hitter in the ninth, 
popping out to second. The Padres, too, are hoping the trade will give him new 
life. They want James to recover the power stroke that led him to hit a 
team-high 19 home runs for the Phillies last year and 17 in 115 games in 1987. 
One of those was a 465-foot home run off Eric Nolte in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium that bounced off a seat in the first row of the left-field second deck. 
It was the last home run hit into the second deck and only the sixth since the 
Padres started play there in 1969. James will wear No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Green, who was recalled from triple-A Las Vegas Friday night, beat James 
to the Padre clubhouse, by about 45 minutes, and into the game -- he replaced 
shortstop Garry Templeton to start the seventh. Green began the day in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., where Las Vegas was playing a weekend series. He said he did 
not learn of the recall until after the Stars' game Friday night. Green started 
the season with the Padres but was sent down to Las Vegas May 7 after hitting 
.176 (three for 17) with two doubles. Green played nine games, starting four at 
shortstop. He again is expected to be used as a late defensive replacement and 
spot starter for Templeton. . . . Bip Roberts doubled to lead off the game, 
marking the fifth consecutive game he has led off for the Padres with a hit. . 
. . Jack Clark had a single in his last at-bat to extend his season-best 
hitting streak to eight games.

<P>
RILEY'S TALK MAY GET OLD, BUT LAKER VICTORIES DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The flight to Portland, had reached its cruising altitude and the captain had 
given the obligatory command to relax and enjoy the flight. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Pat Riley could hardly relax on this late-season trip to a game the 
Lakers had to win to clinch the Pacific Division title. 
</P>
<P>
He had riffled through the sports sections of three newspapers, written notes 
about the opponent on the blue cards he uses during games, barely touched his 
fruit plate, and, now, was being questioned by a reporter, a species Riley 
likes to call a peripheral opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at a most atypical of Laker seasons, one in which his team did not 
even clinch the division title until the 81st game, and looking ahead to what 
figured to be a contentious title defense, Riley threw his manicured hands in 
the air and spoke so softly that the drone of the engines almost muffled the 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, at this point, the only thing you can do is trust them," Riley 
said. "And I trust that they are going to be there when it counts. I have to. I 
think we will win it. We'll find a way to get it done this year. We always do." 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks later, the Lakers have not lost a playoff game. They are back in the 
National Basketball Assn.'s championship series for a third consecutive season, 
doing everything in the playoffs that Riley had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' 11-0 playoff record and bid for the so-called three-peat is, by the 
same token, a testimony to Riley's delicate care and handling, unswerving trust 
and patience, of this veteran team that sometimes appeared uninterested during 
the regular-season grind. 
</P>
<P>
Such coaching subtleties, it seems, are customarily overlooked. The Lakers are 
always supposed to win, period. 
</P>
<P>
So, when reporters voted for NBA coach of the year after the regular season, 
Riley received exactly one of 85 votes. This, despite the Lakers' 57 victories 
and eighth consecutive division title. The favorite, Cotton Fitzsimmons, who 
guided the Phoenix Suns back from oblivion this season, was the easy winner. 
</P>
<P>
It's nothing unusual for Riley. His career record is 470-175 and his teams have 
had eight consecutive seasons with 50 or more victories but Riley has come 
close only once. That was in 1987-88, when he finished second to Denver's Doug 
Moe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the job he does is often taken for granted," Fitzsimmons said of 
Riley. "I understand the award goes to the guy whose team improves the most, 
but that doesn't mean he's the best coach." 
</P>
<P>
But now that the Lakers are undefeated heading into the championship series, 
and now that Riley, with 98 playoff victories, is only one away from equaling 
Red Auerbach's record, some are taking notice. 
</P>
<P>
That, too, is something Riley has come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"Constantly, whenever we get to a significant part of the season, people all of 
a sudden say, 'He brought them this far and he doesn't get any respect,' " 
Riley said. "I grow weary of that. But I understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, 44, says he understands the misperception that coaching the Lakers 
involves little more than dressing nicely, honoring the needs of all those 
million-dollar players, occasionally lodging objections with game officials and 
looking busy during timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, coaching the Lakers may be the most pleasantly difficult 
job in the NBA. Besides the technical side of the game, which every coach is 
required to know, it involves motivating a team with a payroll nearing $11 
million, a team that is supposed to win about 65% of its games or be considered 
underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
This season, as General Manager Jerry West said, might have been the toughest 
for Riley, simply because the Lakers had nothing left to prove. They had won 
consecutive titles, something no team had done since the late '60s. They also 
had to deal with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's farewell tour, which was more 
distracting than motivating. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, 57 victories and a seventh trip to the NBA finals in eight seasons 
translated to only one coach-of-the-year vote. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't matter," Riley said. "I don't care about the credit anymore. My 
reward is winning. My reward is getting to the finals every year. These guys 
are my reward. 
</P>
<P>
"I get tired of hearing about it. I get all the credit I need when (Laker 
owner) Jerry Buss gave me a brand new contract, which was nice. All that other 
stuff doesn't bother me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
That also is the way Riley is approaching the prospect of passing Auerbach's 
record. He says it has no significance, other than proving his belief that the 
Lakers are the team of the '80s, just as the Celtics were the dominant team of 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, without prompting, also acknowledges that because of the current playoff 
format, it is much easier for a coach to win games because they play more 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I think there has to be an asterisk there," Riley said. "I've 
had an opportunity to do it quicker. I've also had the opportunity to be around 
some guys who flat-out know how to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We (he and Auerbach) are comparable only because we've both had great talent. 
And we both admitted it. We didn't defend it. We didn't excuse it. We said, 
'Give me more of it.' I think, on at least that point, we can be compared." 
</P>
<P>
Some might say it stops there. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, for instance, does not brandish a stogie. Nor does he dress in plaid 
polyester and see life through a curmudgeon's eyes. He also, according to some, 
does not have Auerbach's coaching acumen and basketball sense. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists in the basketball world can recite from "Red on Roundball." 
Those same people might expect "Riley on Men's Wear" to be the published work 
of the Laker coach. 
</P>
<P>
Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine, for instance, recently wanted to know how Riley 
keeps his slicked-back hair from looking stiff. 
</P>
<P>
Laker players, however, say they are keenly aware of Riley's worth as a coach. 
They commend his technical skills and, as much as they might privately snicker, 
respond to his psychological ploys and verbal prodding. 
</P>
<P>
With the Lakers, motivating the players often is considered more important than 
teaching them. And over the years, Riley has refined his motivational 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the impassioned speeches and grand gestures he used early in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But he still indulges in an occasional locker-room tirade, still uses 
motivational catch-phrases dismissed by some as psycho-babble and still 
challenges his players in the newspapers. He also continues to send statistical 
goals to each player before training camp and updates them throughout the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Riley seems to know what works and what doesn't, but with essentially the same 
audience, everything gets old. That was part of the reason Riley eventually 
said he just had to trust his team's competitive instincts this time in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons ago, the players responded to Riley's plea that they each have a 
"career best effort," in order to take the title away from the Boston Celtics. 
Last season, they responded to the repeat guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Riley admitted that he could not find a proper stimulus. Sending 
Abdul-Jabbar out a winner doesn't inspire a team when they are playing in 
Sacramento in January. Not even the prospect of gaining the home-court 
advantage throughout the playoffs seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough on him that way," Magic Johnson said. "I think we tried to come 
up to that level (of play) he wanted, but it was hard for us this time. When 
he'd say, 'This is the biggest game of the season,' it's like, 'Aw, c'mon. Not 
another biggest game. We just had one yesterday.' Every game, it's like, 'OK, 
this one really is the biggest.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to rise during the regular when you're like us. But one thing: He 
didn't stop trying. He kept on us, kept on us and kept on us. And, finally, we 
got what he was saying. It registered, and that's why we're playing like we're 
playing now." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he spent part of last summer trying to come up with a theme for this 
season. He said he'd had a similar problem in 1985-86, after the Lakers had 
finally beaten the Celtics in the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
That season, though, the Lakers succumbed to what Riley said was complacency 
and were ousted by the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the toughest year we had was in '86, after we had our greatest moment as 
a team," Riley said. "Then, we really had a problem with incentive and 
motivation, but we hadn't learned yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had to put up or shut up after some comments I made. This year 
was a time unlike any other. It was just a team coming off back-to-back titles 
and dealing with the residual effects. I was in a waiting posture for a lot of 
this year. It's fashionable to attack the Lakers' lack of motivation during the 
season, but there always will be times when we look like we don't give a damn. 
</P>
<P>
"But no other team in this league has experienced what this team has, so that's 
why I said I trusted them. They know exactly who they are and what they have to 
do. And they've done it." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, several veteran players said they need Riley and his motivating, even 
if they sometimes turn down the volume. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of the stuff he says, myself, James (Worthy), Magic and Kareem 
have heard before," veteran guard Michael Cooper said. "We know most of the 
stories. I think a lot of things Riley says are important to our team. But he's 
kind of run out of motivating tactics, so he's repeating himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, that can be good. Sometimes, we need repetition. Most of the things he 
says stick in our minds. I remember and believe what he says." 
</P>
<P>
Riley says he considers the psychological aspects as important as diagramming 
the way to beat a half-court trap, and favors pithy phrases that he calls 
"psychological Band-Aids." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, for example, don't just win important games, they "make a 
statement." When they are in a winning streak, they are playing in a "comfort 
zone." Holding off the competition is "staying ahead of the posse." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he still asks advice on motivation from his wife Chris, a former 
marriage and family counselor. In a recent GQ profile of Riley, Chris was 
portrayed as the prime mover behind Riley's motivational tactics, which Riley 
doesn't totally deny. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of that has been overplayed, but I am not ashamed to say that Chris is 
very important to my work as well as my life," Riley said. "I talk everything 
over with her, and she helps me." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Riley who thought up perhaps his most famous motivational speech, 
delivered before Game 2 of the 1985 finals against the Celtics. The Lakers had 
lost by 34 points in the Memorial Day Massacre at the Boston Garden, and Riley 
shared with the team some advice his late father had once told him: "Somewhere, 
someplace, sometime, you're going to have to plant your feet, make a stand and 
kick some (tail)." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said memories of that story still inspire him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my favorite one," Cooper said. "He can say that any time of the year, 
and that would get me going. Hopefully, someday when I'm coaching, I'll be able 
to relate that one to my players." 
</P>
<P>
One device Riley said he has dropped is a physical display of anger. In 1983, 
Riley kicked down a door to a locker room. In Dallas once, he threw a chair 
across the locker room. He also threw a tray of water cups onto the locker-room 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do that anymore," Riley said, smiling. "At the time, I didn't 
consciously do it. Those were spontaneous things that happened after games. I 
don't like to do it. I did it earlier in my coaching career because I did not 
have any type of control. Now, probably 90% of the time after games, I won't 
even talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps overshadowed by his verbal skills is Riley's talent as a tactician. 
With time and experience in the league, Riley generally is considered above 
average when it comes to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a better coach now," Johnson said. "He's better prepared than 
before. X's and O's, practice. He knows the game and also knows what works for 
this particular team." During Riley's tenure, the Lakers have evolved from 
almost an all-out fast-break team to one that has a successful half-court 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He has his own system now," assistant coach Bill Bertka said. "He's always 
been an excellent X and O guy. He's very meticulous in that. Earlier, I was his 
critic. I said he had too many damn X's and O's. The most important thing is 
what the guys do on the court, and he's focused on what he wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
"He's developed his own coaching style. He's had it since about 1985. Only the 
players change now. We've gotten new faces, but the new faces we have can play 
the system Pat has set up. This is definitely Pat's team. 
</P>
<P>
"His relationship, communication and understanding of the multifaceted 
emotional makeup of this group is certainly a mass of strength." 
</P>
<P>
On that late April flight to Portland, though, Riley seemed more a mass of 
stress. The Lakers had not been involved in such a tight division race since 
the 1981-82 season and he seemed to be trying to convince himself that the 
Lakers' previous dominance would return during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of liken this team to the '68-69 Celtics, (Bill) Russell's last year," 
Riley said. "They dominated that decade, but I think they finished fourth or 
fifth during the regular season. Philadelphia easily beat them in the regular 
season. People wrote that team off. But, when they got to the playoffs, they 
won it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my impression of this team. They will rise to the occasion, too. This 
is the end of a great run. I don't want to beat the guys over the head with it, 
but I want them to understand that this is the end of an era with this team -- 
with Kareem. And we should finish off this decade properly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this season is about. Not repeating. Not greatness. It's about the 
Kareem legacy and finishing an era." 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: SEEING THIS IS TOO MUCH, BY GEORGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overweight? Have trouble bending down to tie your shoes, do you? Clothes too 
tight? Wheeze when you climb stairs? Hard to get in and out of cars? Feet hurt 
from carrying around all that blubber? 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry about it. Have another taco. Load up on chocolate. Buy real whipped 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what you do: Go down to the nearest gym, buy a jump rope, work out on 
the light bag a couple of minutes, spar around with a couple of guys fatter 
than you are. Don't overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
And we'll see about getting you a shot at the heavyweight championship of the 
world at $10 million to $12 million a pop. 
</P>
<P>
You think that's farfetched? Well, tell me, have you had a good look at George 
Foreman lately? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you saw George's "bout" with a pug named Bert Cooper in Phoenix Thursday 
night. If you didn't see it, don't worry. Put on a Three Stooges cassette and 
watch it. Same thing. Everything but the seltzer bottle and a pneumatic blonde. 
A Professor Larbermacher skit was never funnier. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Cooper didn't come to fight. He had trouble escaping blows that came at 
him with the speed and trajectory of an iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman made his fight like a guy waiting for a bus. If it was outdoors, 
pigeons would have lit on him. Guys have moved faster in checkout lines at the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Far be it from me to say that Bert Cooper was there only to disappear at some 
convenient moment, but it's interesting that the Arizona Athletic Commission 
announced even before the fighters had left the ring that they were holding up 
Cooper's purse, $17,000. The suspicion persists this was not the only cash 
coming Cooper's way for his contribution to the comedy skit. 
</P>
<P>
After all, what we're doing with George Foreman here is trying to persuade the 
public to disregard its eyes and trust the promoters that what they're seeing 
is a devastating primal force and not a fat old party who throws punches like a 
shotputter or a guy who has forgotten to let go of a bowling ball. 
</P>
<P>
Now, quitting in your corner is considered quite manly in certain sections of 
the world. It's perfectly acceptable in Britain, for example. But custom calls 
for you to have absorbed a nosebleed or two, maybe a knockdown, before you call 
it a night. Cooper underwent two rounds of unseemly scampering and then, when 
he quit between rounds, was the only person in the arena not surprised by the 
action. As soon as the fight was called, he leaped off his stool with a broad 
smile and rushed over and embraced Foreman, who seemed the least bit 
embarrassed but, maybe, relieved. 
</P>
<P>
Even in his prime, which was a long time ago, it was touch and go whether 
George Foreman could fight at top pitch for more than five rounds. He never had 
to. He first came into public consciousness as the Olympic heavyweight champ, 
master of the quick knockout and the three-round fight at most. 
</P>
<P>
He came into public view at a time when some other Olympic athletes were waving 
black-gloved fists at their country's flag and anthem on victory stands, and 
George endeared himself to the traditionalists by carrying a miniature American 
flag in his gloves to the ring. He stood stiffly at attention as they played 
the national anthem and they carried his Russian or German opponents out by the 
heels. 
</P>
<P>
As a pro, he had only two fights that went the distance. He was a pulverizing 
puncher, he had arms like pythons and fists like paving blocks but his style 
was as uncomplicated as a slow freight on an uphill grade. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he was made to order for Muhammad Ali. Ali could always throw 
the switch on those big slow-freight types and he derailed Foreman for good in 
a predawn fight in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1974. When Foreman got knocked down in 
Round 8, Ali had him too exhausted to have a chance to get up at 10. 
</P>
<P>
It was really the only fight that George ever lost. There was a gavotte with 
Jimmy Young he lost by decision just before he retired in 1977, but it was the 
knockout by Ali in Africa that drove George out of the ring and into a pulpit. 
He became, of all things, a preacher. 
</P>
<P>
George hasn't gotten his old act together for his assault on the title, he's 
got a new one. The old Foreman, while affable enough, was generally a 
monosyllabic, reclusive character who made Gary Cooper seem garrulous. The new 
one has borrowed techniques he used to despise, those of Ali. When the two 
fought in Zaire, Ali was full of bombast, boast, hype and psych -- the usual 
shticks of an Ali prefight promo. Foreman locked himself in his room and slept. 
</P>
<P>
The new Foreman is wiser. He's on his way to one more big score which can put 
the ministry of the Rev. George on its way to saving souls by the millions and 
George is onto it. His postfight utterances after he had disposed of Cooper 
were in the best oratorical traditions of Ali, Hulk Hogan, William Jennings 
Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the hope of every man over 40," boomed George. "I am the hope of everyone 
over 50, 60! I am fighting for old men everywhere. They see me and they know 
everything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
He's also the hope of every guy who can't tighten his belt any more. 
</P>
<P>
But the pugilistic practice of dusting off an old, out-of-shape champion to 
take on the current holder is not new. In 1910, Jim Jeffries was five years 
retired. But the gimmick then was that America had a black champion. Jeffries 
was convinced that he had a holy mission to correct this menace. 
</P>
<P>
The pathetic phrase, "the Great White Hope," was born but the reluctant Jeff 
was pounded into a pulp on the Fourth of July by the Great Black Hunk, Jack 
Johnson, who appeared to be enjoying himself immensely doing it. 
</P>
<P>
George may be the Great Fat Hope. If he could somehow win the title, he could 
set dieting back 50 years. But of course, he could set pugilism back to John L. 
Sullivan.

MORNING BRIEFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paging Satchel Paige: With the formation of the Senior Professional Baseball 
Assn., it's a real-life "Field of Dreams," with Graig Nettles at third, Jerry 
Grote behind the plate, Bill Lee on the mound. "Sure, you're asking, 'Can these 
guys still play baseball?' " said Curt Flood, who will serve as commissioner. 
"Sure, they can. Taking a step or two away from them is not like taking a step 
or two away from guys you play with on the playground." 
</P>
<P>
The league is the idea of James F. Morley, a commercial real estate specialist 
who decided to proceed with the venture after seeing the success of the senior 
golf tour and masters tennis. 
</P>
<P>
The league is supposed to be based in Florida -- where else would retirees go? 
-- and have eight franchises. Teams will be composed of former major league 
players 35 and older -- 32 for catchers -- and will play 72 games from November 
through February. More than 500 players have said they're interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it this way," said Nettles, 44. "It's a chance for me to play again, 
and not in some beer league on Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
Said former Dodger Steve Yeager: "So what if I've lost a step? I wasn't that 
fast to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
But is the world ready for an old-timers' game every day? Are the old-timers 
ready for it? 
</P>
<P>
Bashful Bert: While the National Football League continues its search for a new 
commissioner, they might consider Bert Rechichar, the former Baltimore Colt. 
</P>
<P>
Rechichar talked tough and played the same way. He conducted a game of 
intimidation, and he has his own ideas about how to handle modern players. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with NFL players today is they don't know the value of a dollar," 
Rechichar said. "They have too much money. If I could be the NFL commissioner 
and a player messed with drugs, he would not get a second chance. I'd send him 
down to Skid Row where he belongs."

RAINDROPS DAMPEN DROP SHOTS IN PARIS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe Lawson Duncan can find out who stole the sun in one of those detective 
stories he loves to read. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, rain was a winner at the French Open, where the day was not only 
damp, but colorful. Green tarps were rolled over red clay under a gray sky. 
</P>
<P>
Play was interrupted Saturday at Roland Garros for the second consecutive day, 
but neither wind nor rain nor courts of clay could keep Duncan from his 
appointed round, which is the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
A rare American clay-court specialist who has never made it past the second 
round here, Duncan got his match in early and defeated Jerome Potier of France, 
6-4, 6-0, 6-4. Duncan, from Asheville, N. C., is ranked 67th in the world and 
he is 11-4 on clay since May. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi's timing was not quite as good as Duncan's. His match with Jim 
Courier was halted because of darkness after each had won a set and Courier was 
ahead, 4-2, in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top seeded players spent a trouble-free day, except for trying 
to keep warm and dry. Ivan Lendl and Sweden's Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander 
won their third-round matches with ease. 
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, the moment of the day was provided by Yugoslavia's 
15-year-old Monica Seles, who upset fourth-seeded Zina Garrison of Houston, 
6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Seles upset Garrison twice. The first time was when they walked on 
the court and Seles began passing out some flowers she was carrying. Seles 
tried to give a flower to Garrison, who backed off in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Although the crowd booed Garrison with vigor, she said later that she 
considered a flower an inappropriate gift. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just a bunch of big hype," she said. "That's something someone told her 
to do. You're not out there to give flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Seles nearly broke into tears when she explained that the flowers were her own 
idea. Some of the ball boys had given them to her when she arrived at Roland 
Garros, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to cause anything with those flowers," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, if you want to show someone respect, you give flowers," she said. 
"I just wanted it to be fun. I was surprised she didn't take it. I never 
intended to hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly any U.S. victory on clay is an upset here. Duncan, 24, grew up with 
clay-court stars Bjorn Borg and Guillermo Vilas as his heroes, so when he gets 
his feet on clay he loves it. 
</P>
<P>
"On hard courts, when the ball travels at Mach 5, it's Kamikaze tennis," Duncan 
said. "Serve, return, volley . . . serve, return, volley, pass. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no exposure for U.S. players on clay, and that's really a shame," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the rain came, Gabriela Sabatini's supposedly superior clay-court 
game came close to being exposed as something less than the formidable 
reputation it enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, seeded No. 2 behind Steffi Graf of West Germany, was three points 
away from losing in straight sets but pulled herself together to defeat Nicole 
Provis of Australia, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Provis, a semifinalist here last year, chose the wrong time to slump. She won 
only two points in five games, from the time Sabatini was serving to stay in 
the match at 4-5 in the second set until the Argentine woman led, 2-0, in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Next for Sabatini is Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami, who started slowly but 
finished fast to win her third-round match against Niege Dias of Brazil, 6-7 
(7-3), 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez has defeated Sabatini the last three times they have met -- but none 
of the matches was on clay. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan's next opponent is defending champion Wilander, seeded No. 4, who 
stormed past Omar Camporese of Italy, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
"Feeling as good as I did today, it's hard to understand how I could have been 
playing so bad the last couple of months," Wilander said. "I was hoping that by 
the French Open I would be 100% both physically and mentally. It's a risky 
attitude, but I'm much better now." 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland was down and nearly out but came back 
to defeat Leonardo Lavelle of Mexico, 4-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Hlasek's path to the quarterfinals is blocked by Alberto Mancini of Argentina, 
who defeated qualifier Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3, in 1 
hour 25 minutes. Mancini is 0-2 against Hlasek, but both defeats were in 
exhibitions and occurred before the hot streak Mancini is enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a good player, but I think he plays much better on hard court, so I 
think I have a good chance to beat him," Mancini said. "Now, when I lose, I am 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia took only 1 hour 30 minutes 
to defeat Australian Mark Woodforde, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic will play Edberg, a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, winner over Jimmy Arias. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang will face the top-seeded Lendl, who defeated Darren Cahill of 
Australia in the growing darkness, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-3. Chang won his 
third-round match over Spanish qualifier Francisco Roig, 6-0, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang (17 years 3 months) is the youngest player remaining in the 
field. His advance into the fourth round here equals his best Grand Slam 
result, which was in the U.S. Open last year. . . . Sergio Bruguera of Spain, 
who ended 1988 at No. 333 on the ATP computer and is now up to No. 44, will 
play Ronald Agenor of Haiti in the fourth round. Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet 
Union will play the winner of Courier-Agassi. The other fourth-round matches 
pit Jay Berger against Theirry Tulasne of France and Guillermo Perez-Roldan of 
Argentina against Boris Becker of West Germany.

MORNING BRIEFING: CAVEAT AIKMAN: WAY TO TOP CAN BE ROCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's Troy Aikman, the highest-touted quarterback to come out of college since 
John Elway went from Stanford to the Denver Broncos in 1983, might open the 
season for the Dallas Cowboys, Coach Jimmy Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy has been everything we've expected and more," Johnson said of the first 
pick in this year's draft. "Mentally, he has a good grasp of what we're trying 
to do, and we already knew how physically talented he is. He is right on 
schedule for where we want him to be. He may be ahead of schedule. I have no 
reservations about Troy possibly being the starter in that first game." 
</P>
<P>
Does this sound familiar? Elway also opened his rookie season as the starter. 
He lasted five games until -- his play inept and his confidence shot -- Coach 
Dan Reeves mercifully benched him, realizing he had rushed him. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a pattern here? 
</P>
<P>
Hold the cheese and mustard: Aikman's contract calls for $11 million over six 
seasons, but after mini-camp practices he eats $3 sandwiches and sits on the 
locker room's carpeted floor, brown-bagging it with offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't come in here with an attitude like, 'Clear out, I'm the big cheese,' 
" said linebacker Garry Cobb, formerly of USC. "He's working as hard as 
anybody. There's no hotdog in him." 
</P>
<P>
Piston persona: The point-stingy Detroit Pistons might be the basketball team 
people love to hate, but center Bill Laimbeer says it's not because of the 
tough defense they play, which makes for low-scoring, dull games. "No," 
Laimbeer said. "I think it's more because we have a bunch of personalities that 
people just can't stand." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The legendary ring at Madison Square Garden will be dismantled and 
stored -- perhaps for good -- when the Garden closes for two years of 
renovations soon. Which two famous current boxers never appeared there? 
</P>
<P>
The VIPs strike out: Mike Tyson and his mentor, Don King, preparing to open 
training for a July 21 title defense against Carl Williams at Atlantic City, 
N.J., were unsuccessful in an attempt to get what a Trump executive called "the 
same treatment afforded Donald Trump" -- namely, full-time maid and butler 
service, immediate and unlimited room service and unlimited use of Trump Air, a 
helicopter service between Atlantic City and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be treated as they always have in the past, in first-class Trump 
fashion," the executive said. "Neither Mike Tyson nor Don King has bought Trump 
Plaza yet." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, who will fight in Las Vegas 
June 12. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Georgs Kolesnikovs greeted a Los Angeles reporter in San Francisco 
as Kolesnikovs stepped off his boat after sailing 14,000 miles around Cape Horn 
from New York: "Thanks for coming all this way."

THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
PICKING THE WINNERS -- AND LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN WALKER, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 5, 1982, the Minnesota Twins' future looked bright. They had the fourth 
pick in the baseball draft that morning and when it came their time to select, 
the player they wanted was still available. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an obvious choice," recalled George Brophy, then the Twins' vice 
president for scouting. "Bryan Oelkers had been the college pitcher of the 
year. He was exactly what we needed. So we took him." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets had the next pick. They took Dwight Gooden. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, now everybody asks why we didn't get Gooden," said Brophy, currently a 
scout for Houston. "But he was still in high school, and I'll bet there haven't 
been 10 high-school pitchers to make it big. The Mets caught lightning in a 
bottle that day." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, all 26 major league teams will try to do the same when the three-day 
draft begins. The Baltimore Orioles hold the No. 1 pick for the first time and 
are expected to take Ben McDonald, a pitcher from Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the highly publicized NFL and NBA drafts, where first-round picks almost 
automatically make the team and it is easy to project at least a dozen future 
stars, nothing is certain in baseball's more obscure picking process. Only half 
of the players taken in the first round will ever be successful because too 
many things can happen on the way to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Mariners thought they had a sure thing when they made Al "Choo 
Choo" Chambers the top pick in the 1979 draft. Chambers, a big hitter in high 
school, eventually made it to the majors for a few games but soon disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, the Los Angeles Dodgers gambled in the 17th round on the 
third-best starter on the Bowling Green University staff. That was Orel 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't overpowering, but he had a good arm. Also, there was his makeup and 
continual pursuit of improvement," Dodgers general manager Fred Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give credit to our scouting staff. He didn't come by accident," 
he said. "After all, the 17th round is a long way down, but at the same time, 
that is the 17th-best player you've put into your system in that given year. 
And that's not a throw-away draft." 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th round the same year, the New York Yankees drafted a high school 
player from Indiana who had a pretty swing. He was Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I thought I should've been taken higher," Mattingly said. "But 
when I look back on it, I can see why I wasn't. I couldn't run and I couldn't 
throw. All I could do was hit, and no one knows if a good high school hitter 
will ever make it to the majors." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, only eight of the 26 picks in the first round were high school 
players. But this year, nine of the first 15 picks are expected to come from 
high school, with Atlanta projected to make outfielder Earl Cunningham the 
second choice. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more teams have selected college players, hoping to get 
immediate help without so much risk. The California Angels made Jim Abbott the 
eighth choice last year and Baltimore took Gregg Olson with the fourth pick. 
The No. 1 player was pitcher Andy Benes, selected by San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, though, good players develop from late-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Oakland waited until the 15th round to draft a still-developing high 
school star from Florida -- Jose Canseco. Kansas City held off until the 19th 
round the same year before taking a high school pitcher from Los Angeles who 
had arm trouble -- Bret Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs went in the seventh round to Boston in 1976, Kent Hrbek was 
Minnesota's 17th-round choice in 1978 and Eric Davis signed after being taken 
by Cincinnati in the eighth round in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest picks of all time turned out to be St. Louis' selection in 
the 41st round in 1971 -- Keith Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia found a gem in the 20th round of the 1978 draft, taking Ryne 
Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I had already signed a letter-of-intent to go to Washington State to play 
shortstop and quarterback. Some teams didn't want to waste a pick," Sandberg 
said. "The Phillies took me at the end there and I ended up changing my mind a 
week later." 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry, Harold Baines, Mike Moore and Floyd Bannister are each 
former No. 1 in the nation picks who turned out fine. So was Shawon Dunston, 
the top choice in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Augie Schmidt, taken after Dunston, never made it with Toronto. Next was Jimmy 
Jones, now pitching for the Yankees. Then, Oelkers. 
</P>
<P>
Oelkers, it should be pointed out, reached the majors before Gooden. Oelkers 
had gone 16-2 at Wichita State in 1982 and played for the Twins in 1983, going 
0-5. He's now a minor leaguer with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran into arm trouble. Without that, he would've had a fine career," said 
Brophy, the man who drafted him for Minnesota. "But I guess not as good as 
Gooden."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
NO-HIT SUSPENSE ENDS IMMEDIATELY, BUT RYAN GETS ONE-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He wasn't close to his sixth no-hitter, but 42-year-old Nolan Ryan pitched the 
11th one-hitter of his career and second this season Saturday night at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's first one-hitter of 1989, on April 23, was close, however. The hit came 
with one out in the ninth on a triple by Toronto's Nelson Liriano. 
</P>
<P>
There was no suspense in this one. Harold Reynolds, the first Mariner batter of 
the game, singled. Ryan then shut down Seattle as the Texas Rangers scored a 
6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has been flirting with his sixth no-hitter all season. In his second start 
for the Rangers, on April 12, he pitched a perfect game for six innings, lost 
his no-hitter in the seventh and gave up one hit before retiring after eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The all-time strikeout record-holder broke a record he shared with Bob Feller 
with his 16th low-hit (no-hit or one-hit) game. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out 11 and walked two, improving to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan finished with a flourish, retiring the last 22 Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 7, Cleveland 0 -- By this time a year ago, the Oakland Athletics had 
established themselves as one of the best teams in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
What Tony La Russa's club has accomplished at the one-third mark of this season 
is even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most banged-up club in the majors, the Athletics are still 
battling for first place. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Jose Canseco was well on his way to 42 home runs and 40 stolen bases 
to establish the 40-40 club. 
</P>
<P>
Because of injuries, he hasn't even had an at-bat this season. But Canseco 
merely heads the list of Athletic stars who have been injured. The list 
includes Mark McGwire, the other half of the powerful home run duo. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent additions to the hospital list are sorely missed. Dennis Eckersley, 
the top relief pitcher in the league last season, has a shoulder injury. His 
absence has cost the Athletics a couple of victories already. Friday night, the 
league's leading hitter, Carney Lansford (.356), suffered a strained left 
hamstring and is out indefinitely. And shortstop Walt Weiss recently underwent 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Before every game, La Russa has to search to find enough healthy athletes to 
field a team. He was able to do so Saturday at Oakland against the Cleveland 
Indians by putting catcher Terry Steinbach in left field. 
</P>
<P>
He also had one of his better pitchers ready -- Bob Welch. Welch (7-4) shut 
down the Indians on seven hits in eight innings, and the Athletics ended a 
two-game losing streak. The Indians had won five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 10, Boston 2 -- Boston's Fenway Park attracts thousands of visitors 
each year, but none more appreciative of the landmark than the Toronto Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
With rookie Junior Felix driving in four more runs on three hits, the Blue Jays 
breezed behind Dave Stieb (4-3) to their 11th consecutive victory at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, 21, hit an inside-the-park grand slam Friday night to spark Toronto's 
7-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Detroit 2 -- The Orioles keep building on their lead in the East. 
Jim Traber singled home the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning at Detroit, 
the Orioles won their sixth in a row and their lead jumped to four games. 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger Brian Holton was holding a 2-0 lead for the Orioles on Cal 
Ripken's two-run home run when rain delayed the game for 21 minutes in the 
sixth inning. When play resumed the Tigers chased Holton and tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the Orioles' second win over Doyle Alexander in the last 11 
decisions involving the veteran right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5-1, Chicago 4-2 -- The White Sox ended their home losing streak at 
11 by winning the second game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Minnesota left-hander Frank Viola, who has trouble beating most 
teams these days, staggered to his fourth victory in 11 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlton Fisk, one day off the disabled list, hit a sacrifice fly in the 
eighth inning of the second game to break a 1-1 tie. It was Chicago's first 
victory at home since May 7. They had lost 13 out of 14 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 2, New York 0 -- Bill Krueger came out of the bullpen to pitch five 
strong innings at Milwaukee in his first start since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Krueger, who had made 11 relief appearances, gave up four hits and improved his 
record to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dotson held the Brewers hitless until the fifth when two singles and 
Jim Gantner's double accounted for both runs. DAN HAFNER

SOME LIKE IT HOT: REDS' DAVIS WARMS TO OCCASION AGAIN, SWATS PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It was June before the Cincinnati Reds' Eric Davis really started to hit last 
season. His furious finish enabled the slugger to have another solid season. 
</P>
<P>
He started hitting a little earlier this season and cruised into June on a 
hitting spree. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit a three-run home run to break a 1-1 tie in the sixth inning of the 
Reds' 6-2 victory over the San Diego Padres on a rainy Saturday night in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Davis became the first Red in 30 years to hit for the cycle Friday night when 
he also hit a three-run home run. In the last five games, he is 11 for 18 with 
three doubles in addition to his two homers and has driven in 10 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"After June 1 last season he was the best player in the league," Red Manager 
Pete Rose said. "I hope he's a warm-weather ballplayer. He was last year. I 
hope history repeats. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at his stats, he's been swinging the bat well the last week and a 
half -- -- since it started to get warm." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Davis batted .220 the first two months of the season. But after 
June 1 he hit .300 in 91 games with 20 home runs and 70 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has missed 15 games because of a hamstring injury, has raised his 
average from .217 to .298. 
</P>
<P>
Play was delayed because of rain for 23 minutes in the bottom of the seventh, 
but that didn't affect Rick Mahler (7-5). He went the distance, giving up nine 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 4, Atlanta 0 -- Manager Roger Craig of the West Division-leading 
Giants figures that if Kevin Mitchell played all of his home games in Atlanta, 
he would already have 30 home runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
As a visitor to the league's best hitter's park, Mitchell hit his third home 
run in two games this weekend, giving him a major leagues-leading total of 18. 
</P>
<P>
After Will Clark singled, Mitchell, who appeared to be trying merely to meet 
the ball with two strikes on him, homered to left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hit it that well," said Mitchell, who also leads the majors in runs 
batted in with 53. "I thought it might get to the wall, but you never know 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was costly for the Giants, however. Already hurting for pitching, 
they lost starter Don Robinson after three innings because of a hip injury. 
Atlee Hammaker (5-3) was sharp in relief against the light-hitting Braves. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Chicago 5 -- The Cardinals' luck, which has been mostly bad this 
season, took a turn for the better in the 10th inning at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Whitey Herzog received permission from team doctors to use Tom 
Pagnozzi, a backup catcher who has had a shoulder injury, as a pinch-hitter. 
Pagnozzi hit a long sacrifice fly with the bases loaded, and the Cardinals 
ended a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals had to win it twice. Reliever Ken Dayley was protecting a 5-4 
lead and retired the first two Cubs in the ninth. But Mitch Webster, who had 
not hit a home run all season, tied the score with a home run to left field. 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, Pittsburgh 3 -- Howard Johnson hit a home run and drove in three 
runs at New York as the Mets ended their hitting slump. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry, who missed Friday's game because of back spasms, hit his 
12th home run to help the Mets win their third game in a row. Ten of 
Strawberry's home runs have come with nobody on base. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Darling, given the benefit of the Mets' biggest scoring output since May 
10, gave up eight hits and pitched his first complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, Philadelphia 5 -- The Phillies' recently retired Mike Schmidt threw 
out the first ball at Philadelphia, but it didn't help as the Phillies lost 
their 10th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gross (6-3), a former Philly, left in the ninth inning with one out, the 
bases loaded and a 7-1 lead. The Phillies scored four runs before Tim Burke 
shut down the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga's eighth home run of the season sparked a four-run seventh 
inning for Montreal after Mike Maddux retired the first two Expos. Hubie Brooks 
and Mike Fitzgerald drove in runs before Galarraga's homer. DAN HAFNER

STATE PREP TRACK AND FIELD MEET; 
</P>
<P>
HAWTHORNE BOYS AND MUIR GIRLS BOTH WIN, BUT DO IT DIFFERENTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena Muir Coach Jim Brownfield knew he needed an error-free performance 
from his girls to win the State high school track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly what he got as his team won its second State title in five 
years. Muir scored in every place it needed to finish ahead of Oxnard Rio Mesa, 
36-26, before 10,650 fans Saturday night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Muir needed a perfect night, Hawthorne almost fumbled the boys' team 
title away when its State record-holding 400-meter relay team was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawthorne had too many weapons and the Cougars won their third consecutive 
team title and sixth in the last seven years, outscoring L.A. Dorsey, 40-26. 
</P>
<P>
With the title, Hawthorne Coach Kyle Courtney tied the record for State team 
championships won by a coach, with his seventh overall. He won with the girls' 
team in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Muir started fast with a surprisingly easy victory in the 400-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very nice way to start the meet," said Brownfield, whose Mustangs 
gained their first sprint relay victory over Hawthorne after two straight 
defeats. "We had been running very conservatively until tonight. We let it all 
hang out." 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Mustangs just had to withstand an outstanding night from Rio 
Mesa's star Angela Burnham, who defended her state titles in the 100 and 200 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
Muir's main point contributer was junior Inger Miller, who finished second to 
Burnham in both sprints, while anchoring the Mustangs' 400 meter victory and 
second place 1,600 meter relay finish. Miller ran the 100 in 11.46 seconds and 
the 200 in 23.86. 
</P>
<P>
"We came through tonight and it started with our sprint relay victory," said 
Miller. "That really gave us the push we needed to the end." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her team's second place finish, Burnham was relieved to finish her long 
evening, after running the 100 and 200 meters and anchoring both Rio Mesa relay 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to be done and to finish the season in such a fitting way," said 
Burnham, who tied her seasonal best in the 100 meters, with a wind-aided 11.31 
and ran her second fastest 200 with a 23.56. 
</P>
<P>
"My ultimate goal here tonight, was to defend my state titles and to run my 
race and not worry about the other runners." 
</P>
<P>
In winning her sprint titles, Burnham just had too much strength, in pulling 
away for her fifth consecutive victory over Miller, since two early season 
defeats. 
</P>
<P>
"I was most worried about the 100," said the UCLA-bound Burnham. "I knew that 
it was important to get out of the blocks well." 
</P>
<P>
In Hawthorne's battle for the boys' title, the Cougars had to rally behind the 
performances of sprinter Curtis Conway. 
</P>
<P>
The USC-bound Conway was the Cougars' workhorse in winning the 100 meters 
(10.42), finishing second in the 200 meters (20.89) and anchoring their second 
place 1,600-meter relay finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I am glad that we were able to still win the team title, despite everything 
that happened," said Conway , who had previously failed to win an individual 
title in four years of state finals. 
</P>
<P>
The setbacks the Cougars suffered occured in their specialty events, the 400- 
and 1,600-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
After establishing state marks in the sprint relay, their last three times out, 
including a 40.24 record in Friday night's preliminaries, the Cougars were 
disqualified in the final. 
</P>
<P>
It happened after Erik Allen started the third leg too early, causing the baton 
exchange between him and Anthony Smith to go beyond the passing zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We did everything the hard way tonight," Courtney said. "We did not set a 
record in the relay and suffered losses in races we usually win."

<P>
Hometown favorite Kory Tarpenning cleared 19 feet in the pole vault, but 
otherwise foreign athletes provided most of the excitement Saturday in the 
Prefontaine track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cuba's Ana Quirot broke stadium and meet records in the women's 400 meters 
with the fastest time in the event this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Canada's Lynn Williams beat Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen and recorded the 
fastest women's 3,000-meter time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wolfgang Schmidt, now of West Germany, continued his comeback with a 
victory in the discus, two years after being allowed to leave East Germany, 
where he had been imprisoned for 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Helped by a strong tailwind, Tarpenning, the No. 1-ranked vaulter in the United 
States last year, didn't miss through 19 feet 0 1/4 inch but failed three times 
at a personal best 19-4 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
"All pole vaulters like to have a tailwind, but this was too much today," 
Tarpenning said. "I feel I'm getting in good form for (The Athletics Congress) 
meet in two weeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quirot, part of a four-person Cuban contingent that picked up two firsts, a 
second and a third in the meet, bolted to a big lead on the first turn and 
breezed to victory in 50.14 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Her time broke Diane Dixon's Hayward Field record by 0.27 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Quirot, 26, was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 800 meters last year but 
didn't compete in the Seoul Olympics because Cuba boycotted the Games. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have broken 50 seconds if the wind hadn't been so strong," Quirot said 
through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 1984 Olympic bronze medalist in the 3,000 meters and an Olympic 
finalist last year in both the 1,500 and 3,000, took the lead from Kristiansen 
midway through the race and won in 8:47.92. 
</P>
<P>
Kristiansen, the world 5,000 and 10,000 record-holder, was second in 8:59.20. 
It was her first race on a track in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, the 1976 Olympic silver medalist, won with a throw of 222 feet 7 
inches.

NBA NOTES;

<P>
KNICKS WILL SEE JUST HOW SMART MACLEOD IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi respects John MacLeod because, among 
other reasons, Bianchi says MacLeod is smart. He also likes him because he says 
MacLeod is careful and reserved. 
</P>
<P>
Those traits were in evidence the day after MacLeod became the favorite to 
succeed Rick Pitino, who has left for the University of Kentucky, as coach of 
the Knicks. MacLeod was not turning cartwheels because he might be offered the 
Knicks job. He did not tell anyone that he thought the job had great potential 
and that it would be an honor to coach in New York. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod was saying all the right things. He said he was flattered, but he had a 
commitment in Dallas. He said, "I'm going to talk to Al because Al is a very 
good friend of mine. But that doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to New York to 
take a coaching job." 
</P>
<P>
For MacLeod, the situation was simple. He was employed by the Mavericks and he 
had not been offered the Knicks job. As far as he was concerned, he had to 
believe he was going to be in Dallas next season and he was not going to make 
any dumb, outrageous statements. 
</P>
<P>
If MacLeod is offered the Knicks job, we'll see how smart he really is. For 
MacLeod, these are the facts: 
</P>
<P>
1. He never has been a favorite of Mavericks owner Donald Carter. Carter was a 
close personal friend of former Mavericks coach Dick Motta and thought MacLeod 
was not in Motta's league as a coach. Carter reluctantly accepted the advice of 
other Mavericks executives when he hired MacLeod in 1987, but Carter later 
admitted that even after he interviewed MacLeod, he was considering other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
2. In February, when Roy Tarpley was in a drug rehabilitation clinic and Mark 
Aguirre was pouting and defiantly loafing on the court, the Mavericks were not 
winning often. Several close associates of Carter said he wanted to fire 
MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
3. In New York, MacLeod would work for Bianchi, who was his assistant coach for 
12 years in Phoenix. MacLeod obviously would be supported by Bianchi in a way 
he never will be supported in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
4. The Knicks won 52 games last season. The Mavericks won 38. Tarpley, who is 
as important to the Mavericks as Patrick Ewing is to the Knicks, has two 
strikes in the anti-drug program. The Knicks have the potential to win a 
championship before the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
5. MacLeod says he does not want to uproot his wife and his children, aged 14 
and 11, for the second time in less than three years. But if the Mavericks 
struggle at the beginning of next season, MacLeod probably will be fired and 
will be forced to uproot his family anyway. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod is being careful not to offend anyone in Dallas or New York as he 
decides whether he wants to listen to a job offer from Bianchi. But it is 
obvious that the Knicks job is a better one than the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Los Angeles Lakers are facing an inactive stretch of at least eight 
days, while they wait to find out who they will play in the championship 
series, Coach Pat Riley has decided to take them to Santa Barbara, Calif., for 
a three-day minicamp through Saturday. Riley has said the Lakers might have 
two-a-days, but he has said that before and not followed through. 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of the number of practices, Riley said, "Our goal is to go there 
and work hard. This is an opportunity if our players use it to prepare 
properly. We can get honed and replenish." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Heat seems to be in great position in the college draft. The 
Sacramento Kings apparently are leaning toward taking Danny Ferry with the No. 
1 pick. The Los Angeles Clippers probably would follow by taking Sean Elliott, 
and then the San Antonio Spurs probably would take Pervis Ellison with the 
third pick. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat then could take Glen Rice with the fourth pick, and Rice would be 
perfect. Last season, the Heat averaged only 97.8 points, worst in the league. 
The Heat also scored the fewest points in a quarter (nine), half (26) and game 
(65). The team needs points, and Rice will score big in the NBA. He would get a 
lot of shots with the Heat, enough maybe to finish in the top 10 next season. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the Western Conference finals, reporters looking for new Laker angles 
began writing about how well the bench was playing. Phoenix Suns Coach Cotton 
Fitzsimmons acknowledged that Mychal Thompson, Michael Cooper and Orlando 
Woolridge were playing well, but he said don't forget that the team revolves 
around Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"If Michael or Orlando had to carry a team," Fitzsimmons said, "you people 
would be writing nasty things about them." 
</P>
<P>
The bad timing award of the week unfortunately went to Alvin Robertson, who was 
traded Sunday from the Spurs to the Milwaukee Bucks. The trade came three weeks 
after Robertson's second child was born and only two days after Robertson 
signed closing papers on an $800,000 house in San Antonio. Robertson said the 
trade was "like a death in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Greg "Cadillac" Anderson, who will go with Robertson to Milwaukee in exchange 
for Terry Cummings, said he understood, then delivered a unique assessment. 
Anderson said that for the Spurs, Robertson was "the shoelace to the tennis 
shoe." Cadillac apparently has taken mega-doses of Dick Vitale.

HERE ARE SOME FINAL FACTS ON NBA PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BARNARD, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NBA, while growing in popularity in the 1980s, struggled to find an 
identity for its ultimate best-of-7 race for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
While the World Series, Super Bowl and Stanley Cup are hallowed sports 
institutions, the NBA changed the name of its championship series three times 
in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1982, the official name was the NBA World Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
Then the league, armed with a new television contract that finally put all 
championship series games in prime time or Sunday afternoon, made a failed 
attempt at a glitzy tag. 
</P>
<P>
The next two years, the NBA tried Showdown '83 and Showdown '84 on for size and 
it didn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the NBA introduced a new playoff logo and went back to NBA World 
Championship Series before settling on simplicity -- The NBA Finals -- in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
No team from 1980-88 made the NBA Finals without at least one 20-point scorer. 
</P>
<P>
The last team to do so was Seattle in 1979. The Sonics won the NBA championship 
that year with Gus Williams their leading regular-season scorer at 19.2 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
In seven of the first nine years of the decade, the team with the best 
regular-season record won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions so far came in 1985, when Boston had the best record of 
63-19 and the Lakers, at 62-20, were the winners, and in 1982, when Boston also 
was 63-19 and the Lakers, at 57-25, defeated Philadelphia, 58-24, for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers in 1982-83 had the best regular-season record of the decade, 65-17, 
and Moses Malone predicted a "Fo, Fo, Fo" sweep of the 1983 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They almost made it, losing only one game to Milwaukee in the semifinals.' 
</P>
<P>
Despite sweeping the Lakers in the Finals, Philadelphia trailed at halftime of 
all four games. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, Julius Erving and Maurice Cheeks were the unquestioned stars of the 
team, but the 76ers got help from unexpected sources in that series. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, reserve guard Clint Richardson scored 15 points in 31 minutes as the 
76ers won 113-107. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve center Earl Cureton played 5 1/2 minutes down the stretch in the second 
game when Malone got in foul trouble. He hit a sky hook over Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar to seal a 103-93 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Six players have won playoff Most Valuable Player awards in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Five of them are legitimate NBA superstars -- Magic Johnson in 1980, 1982 and 
1987, Larry Bird in 1984 and 1986, Malone in 1982, Abdul-Jabbar in 1985 and 
James Worthy in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth name is not so memorable. It was Cedric Maxwell for the 1981 Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring only 16 points and grabbing 13 rebounds as Boston split the first 
two games of the series at home against Houston, Maxwell carried the Celtics 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 24.5 points and 11 rebounds in the last four games, including 28 
points and 15 rebounds in the pivotal Game 5 that gave the Celtics a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with 27 points and five rebounds in the 102-91 finale at Boston 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell didn't fare nearly as well in his other two championship series 
appearances with the Celtics, averaging 8.0 points and 2.8 rebounds in 1984 and 
1985 and was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers before the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the last five NBA champions won just 30 percent of their road playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Lakers and 1984 Celtics each were 3-7 in the playoffs away from home.

Templeton 7, Avalon 4 -- Coach Jerry Reynolds, who has won three Southern 
Section football titles, guided Templeton to its first softball title. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Schubert's three-run triple highlighted a five-run seventh inning as 
Templeton overcame a 4-2 deficit. Shannon Savage's ground ball to second base 
scored Barbara Cowne, who ran for Schubert, for the final run. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander Amy Crabtree (18-7) held Avalon scoreless in the bottom 
of the seventh. Crabtree allowed three earned runs on seven hits and five 
walks. She struck out eight.

3-A BASEBALL;

KENNEDY WINS AS SAUGUS FALLS ONE PITCH SHORT, 1-0 
</P>

<P>
The Southern Section 3-A Division baseball championship came down to one pitch 
-- a wild pitch -- that allowed La Palma Kennedy High School to defeat Saugus, 
1-0, Saturday at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hansell, the starting pitcher for Kennedy, found himself on second base in 
the ninth inning after a two-base throwing error by third baseman Trevor Rice. 
Scott Wood advanced Hansell to third on a bunt single. The next batter, Don 
Cochran, took the first pitch as Wood stole second base. Saugus pitcher Roger 
Salkeld then threw the ball in the dirt and Hansell scored the game's only run. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Kennedy (26-5) its first championship. Saugus (23-5-2) won its 
only championship in 1986 as a member of the 2-A division. 
</P>
<P>
The game was expected to be a pitcher's duel and it didn't disappoint. Salkeld 
was 12-0 with 169 strikeouts in 100 innings. His earned-run average was 0.69. 
Hansell entered the game 12-1 with an ERA of 1.37 and 113 strikeouts in 87 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell retired the first 10 batters, the first six by strikeout. He finished 
the game with 10 strikeouts as only one Saugus runner reached third. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who is expected to be selected in the first round of Monday's major 
league baseball draft, struck out nine and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell has signed a football letter-of-intent to attend Nevada Reno. However, 
Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal isn't sure if those plans will hold up. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg's value went up today for next week's draft, and I think a high pick may 
change his mind," Pascal said. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell agreed. "I wish I could throw off that thing (a major league pitching 
mound) all day."

Robby Gordon and co-driver Russ Wernimont, who went most of the way without 
first and second gears, won the 390-mile Presidente SCORE Baja Internacional 
off-road race Saturday by nearly eight minutes over Ivan Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon and Wernimont, in a Ford pickup, lost about 15 minutes due to a mishap 
just 25 miles into the first of three laps around the 130-mile course through 
the desert and foothills west of here in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, 20, of Orange, and Wernimont, 25, of San Jacinto, had an elapsed time 
of 7 hours 2 minutes 44.4 seconds and an average speed of 60.76 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 43, of Lakeside, Calif., drove his Toyota to an elapsed time of 
7:10:31.3 and an average speed of 59.66 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the race, Gordon hit the brakes to avoid a spectator's car that was on 
the course. His pickup rammed a tree and got hung up. It caused the 
transmission problems.

U.S. GRAND PRIX AT PHOENIX;

SENNA WILL TRY TO GIVE BRAZIL A SWEEP OF AMERICA'S TOP RACING HONORS

<P>
Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi took home America's greatest racing prize last 
Sunday when he won the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
Now another Brazilian, Ayrton Senna, threatens to take home America's round in 
the world Formula One championship series, today's Iceberg U.S. Grand Prix on 
the streets of downtown Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Fittipaldi sent Senna a wire wishing him well in today's race, 
exhorting him to win for their mutual sponsor, Marlboro, and their mutual 
hometown, Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, 29, may have received some inspiration from Fittipaldi, 42, the former 
two-time world champion, but he probably doesn't need it. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, the reigning world champion, did not improve his qualifying speed during 
Saturday's hour time trial, but his Friday lap of 94.287 m.p.h. over the 
12-turn, 2.36-mile circuit in a McLaren-Honda was quick enough to put him on 
the pole for today's 182-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
It was Senna's eighth consecutive pole and the 34th in his career, breaking him 
out of a tie with the late Jim Clark for all-time Formula One poles. 
</P>
<P>
"I take the record from Jim Clark, a man I never saw racing, but by his results 
was obviously a very special driver, so it is a special experience for me to 
first equal and then break, his record," Senna said. 
</P>
<P>
Winning poles is not Senna's only streak. 
</P>
<P>
The talented Brazilian has won the last three Grand Prix, in San Marino, Monaco 
and Mexico. All three were won wire to wire. He has also won the last three U. 
S. Grand Prix, all in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Although Senna did not better his Friday speed during qualifying, he posted a 
faster lap of 94.479 m.p.h. during morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not seem to get my tires working as well as yesterday," he said. 
"Perhaps without the pressure, too, I did not get myself wound up the way I 
usually do for qualifying." 
</P>
<P>
Senna had no challenge. His McLaren teammate, Alain Prost of France, was next 
fastest at 92.878 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If Senna and Prost finish one-two, as they have done twice already in four 
races this season, they will extend their all-time teammate record to 12. In 
the San Marino GP, they not only finished one-two, they both lapped the entire 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Prost qualified the team's backup car after crashing his primary car in morning 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the problems I've experienced today, I am quite happy with second 
place," said Prost, who has been an unhappy driver most of the time because of 
what he has felt to be team favoritism toward Senna. 
</P>
<P>
"I crashed my car this morning. It was my own fault, and it was the first time 
I badly damaged the monocoque (chassis) since I joined McLaren. Then this 
afternoon, my rear brake calipers were getting hot and I also got caught up in 
traffic. For sure, a very difficult day." 
</P>
<P>
Prost spun his car backwards into the wall in the sweeping hairpin turn just 
before the pits, severely damaging the right rear. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix course, with wider streets and newly paved asphalt, proved much 
faster than street circuits at Detroit and Long Beach, where neither had a 90 
m.p.h. lap. 
</P>
<P>
Today's race will be shown on ESPN at 1:30 p.m.

MOTORCYCLE RACING AT LONG BEACH;

<P>
ERMOLENKO NEEDS 4-LAP RUNOFF TO DEFEAT MORAN AND CORREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Speedway motorcyclist Sam Ermolenko of Cypress won a four-lap runoff against 
Shawn Moran and Ronnie Correy to take the Nissan American Final for the third 
straight year Saturday night before 4,372 fans at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ermolenko drew the outside starting position for the race, with Correy starting 
on the pole and Moran sandwiched between them. Moran took an early lead going 
into the first turn, but Ermolenko turned on the horsepower to pass Moran and 
win the first qualifying round for American riders that leads to the world 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ermolenko, Moran and Correy finished tied with 19 points after five heat races, 
each rider beating one of the others during the course of the evening. The 
three will advance to the Overseas Final June 25 at Belle Vue, England, along 
with Lance King, who finished fourth with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Correy, 22, of Fullerton, stunned Ermolenko in their first race when he powered 
past the country's best rider to win Event No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Ermolenko beat Moran in their first race in Event No. 10, but Moran defeated 
Correy in Event No. 14, to force the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
However, Moran's status in international competition is hinged on a pending 
appeal of a suspension by the American Motorcyclist Assn. when he tested 
positive for alcohol at a long track meeting in Denmark last month. 
</P>
<P>
Ermolenko has qualified for four consecutive world championship races and once 
again appears to be America's best bet to win the title on Sept. 9 in Munich, 
West Germany. Ermolenko has finished third in the world championship twice in 
the past four years.

MOTOR RACING NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
FORMAT FOR INDY TRIALS MAY CHANGE NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's being kept very close to the vest but the complicated qualifying procedure 
for the Indianapolis 500 may be changed for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The way it works now, an unlimited number of cars can qualify on each of the 
four days of time trials, with the slowest qualifiers being bumped out after 
the 33-car field is filled. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of qualifications last month was rained out, with 26 cars making 
it into the tentative lineup the second day. 
</P>
<P>
Another five drivers made it in on the third day and there were five qualifiers 
on the final day, including three bumps. 
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that officials of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway have not 
been particularly pleased with attendance at time trials after the opening day, 
which generally draws about 150,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The qualifying procedure has changed just four times since the first Indy 500 
in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the drivers simply had to prove they could drive at least 75 m.p.h. 
That changed to a full lap at at least 75 m.p.h. in 1912 and a blind draw was 
used in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
The four-lap, 10-mile qualifying average being used now went into effect in 
1915. It has been that way except for the races from 1933 to 1938 when the 
drivers qualified with the average of 10 laps (25 miles). 
</P>
<P>
Speedway officials aren't saying for sure, but behind the scenes talk has one 
possible scenario limiting the number of qualifiers on each of the four days to 
a specific number in order to ensure a good show each day. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of rumors, the silly season already has begun. 
</P>
<P>
One report has Rick Galles adding a second car to his team next year. 
</P>
<P>
It's already well known that Marlboro will be on Danny Sullivan's car for 
Penske Racing in 1990, leaving Miller out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Now it appears that Miller will join Valvoline at Galles Racing in Albuquerque, 
N.M., and two-time Indy-car champion Bobby Rahal or Indy 500 winner Emerson 
Fittipaldi appear the likely drivers to join Al Unser Jr. on the two-car team. 
</P>
<P>
It's also been learned that Porsche, which has Teo Fabi as its lone driver this 
year will add a second car next season. 
</P>
<P>
In NASCAR's Winston Cup series, there's been all kinds of talk about Rusty 
Wallace leaving Raymond Beadle's Blue Max team next season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite denials all around, rumors persist that Wallace, last year's series 
runner-up to Bill Elliott, will leave, taking crew chief Barry Dodson and other 
members of the team with him. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Trickle may feel a little sense of deja vu today when he races in the 
Budweiser 500 at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Trickle, the winner of more than 1,200 feature events in his racing career, 
came to Dover on Aug. 3, 1969, for a U.S. Auto Club stock car race as the 
leading candidate for Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the 47-year-old Midwestern short track ace is the leading Rookie of 
the Year candidate on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Foyt won that race 20 years ago, with Trickle credited with fifth on the 
one-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that race almost as if it happened yesterday, and there's a big 
reason why," said Trickle, who is filling in this season for injured Mike 
Alexander. "To this day, I think I really finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"The race was scheduled as a 300-mile, 200-lap race, but it started raining 
after we'd completed 125 laps or so. We ran another 25 or so laps under the 
caution to make it official by completing over half the laps required. 
</P>
<P>
"During those caution laps, Jack Bowsher, for no apparent reason, passed me on 
the backstretch. I passed him back. We just kept on going around each other 
until I settled back and figured the scorers had a handle on the situation. 
Boy, was I ever wrong. They awarded him the spot after the race was over. What 
a deal!" 
</P>
<P>
Trickle is obviously hoping for a better ending in today's 500-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Money, money, money. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson Fittipaldi's $1 million payoff for winning the $5.7 million Indy 500 
last Sunday is a milestone for auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
The first million dollar purse in racing history came at Indy in 1970, when 
winner Al Unser took home $271,697. 
</P>
<P>
The Daytona 500 became a $1 million event in 1985. That same year, Bill Elliott 
became the all-time winningest driver in a single season with earnings of $2.3 
million. That included $1 million for winning the Winston Million, paid to a 
driver who can win three of NASCAR's Big Four races -- the Daytona 500, the 
Winston 500 at Talladega, the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Southern 500 
at Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first year of the Winston Million and nobody has done it since 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
But Darrell Waltrip has a shot this year after winning Daytona and the 600 with 
the Southern 500 on Sept. 4 the last remaining link. 
</P>
<P>
Marlboro, Fittipaldi's sponsor, also has put up $1 million to any Indy-car 
driver who can sweep the three races it sponsors -- the Marlboro 500 at 
Michigan, the Marlboro Grand Prix at the New Jersey Meadowlands and the 
Marlboro Challenge at Laguna Seca Raceway.

THATCHER PITCHES AGOURA TO TITLE IN 1-A SOFTBALL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Agoura High softball team, which won only one game in the 1986 and 1987 
seasons combined, completed a rags-to-riches journey by winning its first 
Southern Section 1-A Division title with a 4-1 victory over Big Bear in the 
championship game Saturday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (23-2), in their first venture outside the opening round of the 
playoffs, got a strong performance by sophomore right-hander Melissa Thatcher, 
the pitcher of record in every Agoura decision this season. Thatcher threw a 
four-hitter, walked two and struck out nine -- including the side in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of them on curves," she said of the strikeouts. "I didn't throw 
too many fastballs. I tried to make them guess what's coming." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher had no clue as to what was coming after the game when her teammates 
covered her with whipped cream. Agoura Coach Linda Moule received similar 
attention when the Chargers dumped a cooler of water over her head. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear Coach Mike Clifton was not in the mood to celebrate, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not our best effort," said Clifton, who coached the Bears (22-4) to the 
Small Schools Division title last year. "When you play the final, you have to 
play your best game to win. 
</P>
<P>
"They put the ball in play and we didn't play defense." 
</P>
<P>
With her team trailing, 1-0, in the first, Agoura's Jill Hartwig reached base 
on a fielding error and, with one out, Thatcher singled. Both scored on Leslie 
North's double to center field and the Chargers led, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, which won its last 20 games of the season, was limited to four hits by 
Marjie Sievers (20-4). But the Chargers picked up a pair of important insurance 
runs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Bailey reached base on a throwing error and scored when Big Bear first 
baseman Leigh Anne Drake threw the ball into center field after Tamara Dulansky 
was retired on a sacrifice bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Baertschiger followed with a bunt single, advanced to second on a 
sacrifice and scored the Chargers' final run when third baseman Daphne Staricka 
overthrew Drake after fielding Lisa Little's ground ball.

SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS;

BASEBALL TITLES SLIP PAST SAUGUS, HART; 
</P>
<P>
INDIANS LOSE TO CERRITOS IN 4-A FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High, which had scored 57 runs in four playoff games, was held to four 
hits by Cerritos and lost the Southern Section 4-A Division championship game, 
4-1, Saturday night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians (23-7) fell victim to a wicked side-arm slider thrown by 
right-hander Mark Mattingly, who won his fourth game in the playoffs. Mattingly 
(11-2) saved the only postseason game he didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
"His fastball wasn't thrown hard at all," Hart catcher Casey Burrill said. "But 
that was a true slider. We've seen sliders before, but nothing that wouldn't 
fall." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly's pitches made Hart batters fall. Fall behind in the count. Fall back 
on their heels. Fall back to the dugout after being retired. 
</P>
<P>
Burrill got the only Hart hit in the first four innings -- a single -- off a 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' defensive miscues, however, were more devastating than Mattingly's 
sliders. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which averaged one error a game, committed four errors, two of which came 
in the fourth inning when Cerritos took a 2-0 lead. Third baseman David Toledo 
overthrew first base on consecutive routine plays in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our defense was trying to do too many things right," said Toledo, who 
had committed just five errors during the season before commiting three against 
Cerritos. "We just weren't playing relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Bud Murray, who spent most of the postgame ceremony consoling 
Toledo: "It's too bad it happened to that kid. . . . He's a hell of a player." 
</P>
<P>
Hart mounted its only substantial rally in the fifth, but it was squelched by 
an outstanding defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
After Burrill led off the inning with a fly out to deep center field, Chris 
Vasquez tripled down the first-base line. Jason Edwards singled to center to 
score Vasquez, then Toledo followed with a double to the left-field wall, 
advancing Edwards to third. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Sanford popped up to shortstop for the second out, however, and left 
fielder Doug Nelson made a spectacular sliding catch of Lance Migita's looping 
hit over shortstop to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got really close to it, I knew I had it for sure," Nelson said of the 
inning-ending catch. "It was the greatest feeling of my life. I thought, 'God, 
How'd I do that.' Amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly said that he plans to reward Nelson for the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take him out to lunch," he said. "That was the turnaround of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (27-6) scored two more runs in the fifth when Robert Hinds, who 
reached base on a bunt and advanced to third on a balk by Andrew Lorraine and a 
single by Curt Knabe, came home on Cobi Cradle's sacrifice fly. Knabe, who 
moved to third on a single and a fielder's choice, took advantage of Lorraine's 
slow windup and stole home for the Dons' final run. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Darin Tsukashima led off the sixth with a single, then stole second, but 
the next three batters popped out. The Indians were retired in order in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine (9-5) struck out eight, including the side in the third, and scattered 
six hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if we were going to lose, I wanted to be the one out there to lose 
it," Lorraine said. 
</P>
<P>
That he was, but Lorraine and his teammates could be consoled by the fact that 
the Indians advanced three rounds further than last year's Hart team, which won 
its first 25 games before losing to Fullerton in the second round.

EL SEGUNDO BEATS SAN MARINO, 7-4, FOR CIF BASEBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His sixth CIF-Southern Section title safely tucked away, El Segundo High 
baseball Coach John Stevenson met with reporters Saturday outside the 
third-base dugout at Dodger Stadium while Pat Llamas planned his devilish deed. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of teammates, the Eagles' senior second baseman sneaked up behind 
his coach with a bucket of Gatorade and dumped the contents on an unsuspecting 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard somebody say, 'Pour it on him, pour it on him,' " Llamas said. "It's a 
good thing he wasn't mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
Not on this day, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In a game Stevenson said he couldn't have scripted any better, the Eagles 
scratched and clawed for a 7-4 victory over San Marino to capture the 2-A 
Division championship. All 16 players on the roster contributed to the win, El 
Segundo's first in a CIF final since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way you diagram it," said the 30-year coach, who improved his career 
mark to 632-243. "It's the best (CIF title) yet because it's right now. You 
can't live in the past and you can't live in the future." 
</P>
<P>
But both were represented Saturday. Kansas City Royals slugger George Brett, a 
former El Segundo star, was in attendance and congratulated Stevenson in the 
locker room. On the field, the Eagles' future was represented by the 10 
underclassmen who played in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the type of tradition El Segundo has," said Stevenson, alluding to the 
presence of Brett, who is on the disabled list with a knee injury. "The loyalty 
of the whole (Brett) family is a big part of our baseball tradition." 
</P>
<P>
However, unlike some of El Segundo's past championship teams, the 1989 Eagles 
were not considered an overpowering unit. Their pitchers didn't strike out a 
lot of batters, their hitters didn't hit a lot of home runs and their size -- 
two-thirds of the players are under 6 feet tall -- certainly didn't intimidate 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
But they usually found a way to win. 
</P>
<P>
Again that was the scenario Saturday, as the Eagles used the tenacious pitching 
of senior Rick Clark and an opportunistic offense to control the game against 
San Marino, which outhit El Segundo, 9-6, but was hurt by four errors. 
</P>
<P>
"We forced our own breaks," Stevenson said. "This is just a very competitive 
group of guys." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, the Camino Real League champion, finished the season with a 26-5 
record and eight consecutive victories. San Marino, the third straight team 
from the Rio Hondo League to fall to El Segundo in the playoffs, wound up 22-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles never trailed after scoring three unearned runs in the second inning 
to take a 3-1 lead. They scored twice in the fourth to go up 5-2, and added two 
more runs in the fifth to make it 7-2. In those three innings, El Segundo 
needed just five hits to score seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino Coach Mickey McNamee, who was going after his third CIF crown, 
blamed defense for his team's downfall. Only two of El Segundo's runs were 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not make the defensive plays when we had to, and consequently they took 
advantage of our mistakes," he said. "That's what good teams do. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hit the ball well. If we played defense, it could have been a 
different game." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Titans hit the ball hard at times, they couldn't chase Clark from 
the mound. The right-hander improved to 10-0 with a performance that was a test 
of endurance. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Clark might get the hook after San Marino scored two runs in the 
top of the seventh to pull within 7-4. But, with a runner on first, the feisty 
5-9, 140-pounder caught Robbie Santos looking at a called third strike on a 
curveball to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to come out," Clark said. "If they would have taken me out, I 
would have been mad. I knew I was going to finish. There's no way we were going 
to lose that game." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said he had junior right-hander Rob Croxall ready in the bullpen from 
the first inning, but decided to stick with Clark because "of his heart." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, it was not the heart of El Segundo's lineup that did the most 
damage. Center fielder Erik Evans and catcher Garret Quaintance, the team's 
heavy hitters all season, were each 0 for 2 with two walks while the bottom 
four hitters -- Chris Lane, Llamas, Brett Newell and Mark Lewis -- combined for 
six runs, three hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best way to end it for me," said Llamas, who was 2 for 3 with two 
runs scored. "I'm just happy the team won. This is the best bunch of guys I've 
ever played with." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo loaded the bases in the second on an error, a single to right-center 
field by Llamas and a bunt to the left side of the mound by Newell. Lewis 
followed with a run-scoring grounder and Jeremy Carr put the Eagles ahead to 
stay, 2-1, with a single that glanced off the mound to the left side of the 
infield. Newell scored the last run of the inning when he stole home after Carr 
intentionally got caught in a rundown between first and second. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Carr drove in Llamas, who had singled, with a groundout and 
Newell came home on a wild pitch by right-hander Dan Giddings (9-3). 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Talanoa opened the fifth with a double to left, El Segundo's only 
extra-base hit, and scored on the second of three errors by San Marino second 
baseman David Kadin. Lane, who had walked, scored the Eagles' final run on a 
sacrifice fly to right by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Eagles committed only two errors and turned in several 
outstanding plays. Perhaps the most impressive was by Evans, who robbed Santos 
of an extra-base hit in the sixth with a running catch in deep right-center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Since El Segundo led throughout the game, Stevenson could afford to play his 
entire roster. That seemed to give him the most pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"That is such a priorty with me," he said. "To be able to play everybody makes 
the win twice as nice."

BURNHAM, MILLS HOLD ON TO TITLES; 
</P>
<P>
RIO MESA SPRINTER, CAMPBELL HALL JUMPER REPEAT AS STATE TRACK CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High and Crissy Mills of Campbell Hall both 
successfully defended their titles in the state track and field championships 
at Cerritos College in Norwalk on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But their reactions to the victories were as different as the events in which 
they competed. 
</P>
<P>
While junior Mills wore an I-can't-believe-I-did-it smile of exhilaration after 
winning the high jump with a personal best of 6 feet, Burnham sported a 
just-another-day-at-the-office look after winning the 100 (wind-aided 11.31 
seconds) and 200 meters (23.56) for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham's victories -- combined with last year's double and her state 100 title 
as a freshman in 1986 -- put her into the record books in several categories. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is the first girl to win five state sprint titles during her career, 
surpassing Denean Howard of Kennedy, who won two titles each in the 200 and 400 
in the early '80s. Burnham is also the first girl to win three 100 titles and 
the only girl to turn the 100-200 double in consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she appeared subdued after leading Rio Mesa -- last year's 
co-champion with Bakersfield -- to a second-place finish behind Pasadena Muir 
in the team scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa scored 26 points while Muir -- led by Inger Miller -- totaled 36. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, led by Curtis Conway, won its third consecutive title in the boys' 
meet and its sixth in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just tired," Burnham said after winning the 100, 200, and anchoring the 
Spartans' 400- (47.53) and 1,600-meter (3 minutes, 52.14 seconds) relay teams 
to fourth- and fifth-place efforts, respectively. "I just ran to win today, I 
wasn't thinking about any particular times." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham's victory margins of .15 seconds in the 100 and .30 in the 200 were 
doubly impressive as they came against Miller, who had beaten Burnham in two 
(both 100s) of five previous meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham got off to a good start in the 100 and was never threatened. Miller 
came out of the blocks slowly, made up ground between 20 and 60 meters, but 
then couldn't match Burnham's final 40 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"Her start was comparable to last year's state meet," Rio Mesa co-Coach Brian 
FitzGerald said. "I think it looked better than it was because Inger got out 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Miller led Burnham for the first 120 meters of the 200 before Burnham swooped 
past her with 60 meters left. 
</P>
<P>
"She just has a great ability to hold her top-end speed," FitzGerald said. 
"Inger was right with her coming off the turn, but she looked like she was 
carrying a weight at the end of the race." 
</P>
<P>
Mills had no such problems in the high jump, surpassing her previous best by 1 
1/4 inches while coming from behind to defeat J. C. Broughton of Woodland, the 
state leader at 6-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe I did it," Mills said. "It's just like last year. It 
really hasn't set in yet." 
</P>
<P>
The last jumper in the competition order, Mills cleared 5-4, 5-6, 5-8 and 5-10 
on her first attempts before needing three tries at a personal best of 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
Broughton cleared that height on her initial attempt, so Mills found herself in 
second as the bar was raised to six feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself I could make it," Mills said. "But I was still surprised 
when I cleared it on my second attempt. I still can't believe I did it." 
</P>
<P>
After Broughton's third miss at that height, Mills had three relatively close 
attempts at a state-meet record of 6-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally I was telling myself that I could do it," Mills said. "But 
physically, my body was saying, 'get real, Crissy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lewis of Burbank had similar feelings in the final 70 meters of the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth after the first 800 meters (2:05.8) and fourth after 1,200 (3:09.3), 
Lewis surged into the lead with 220 meters to go. But he could not hold off 
Francis O'Neill of Escondido San Pasqual and Coley Candaele of Carpinteria in 
the final straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, fourth in the 1,600 in last year's state meet, passed Lewis with 70 
meters to go and Candaele, third in '88, nipped Lewis at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill ran 4 minutes, 8.67 seconds, Candaele timed 4:09.01 and Lewis clocked a 
personal best of 4:09.02. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran as well as I could today," Lewis said. "But he (O'Neill) just ran a 
great race. When he went by me in the stretch, he didn't waste any time . . . I 
tried to respond but there was nothing there to respond with." 
</P>
<P>
Like Lewis, Bryan Dameworth of Agoura and Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks set 
personal bests -- in the boys' 3,200 meters -- but failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
That honor went to David Welsh of Sacramento Jesuit, who won in 8:58.08. 
Dameworth placed second in 9:00.27 and Williamson was third in 9:04.91. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson forced the early pace as expected -- leading at 800 meters in 2:13.1 
and at 1,600 in 4:27.8 -- but Dameworth, Welsh and Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana 
Valley caught the Lancer senior with 600 meters to go. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, the two-time defending state Division I cross-country champion 
pulled alongside Welsh with 250 meters to go, but Welsh repelled his charge and 
pulled away with 200 meters left. 
</P>
<P>
Other third-place efforts came from Charles Brown of Channel Islands in the 300 
intermediate hurdles (personal best of 37.60); Jeff Ingalls of Agoura in the 
400 (48.18); Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley in the 800 (1:52.79); and 
Russell White of Crespi in the triple jump (48-7). 
</P>
<P>
White also placed eighth in the 200 (21.83) and ninth in the long jump (23-1 
1/4). 
</P>
<P>
Deena Drossin of Agoura placed third in the girls' 3,200 with a personal best 
of 10:36.67.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL; 
</P>
<P>
NAHMIAS LEADS WOODLAND HILLS TO 11-5 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenn Nahmias had three doubles and two runs batted in, and right-hander Chris 
Brown threw a six-hitter to lead Woodland Hills East to an 11-5 victory over 
host Reseda on Saturday in an American Legion District 20 Western Division 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Brown struck out eight and walked three in the complete-game victory in 
Woodland Hills East's opener. Telly Wickert picked up two of Reseda's six hits 
with a two-run home run in the second inning and a double. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale 11, San Fernando 10 -- Don Gravois' run-scoring single in the ninth 
knocked in the winning run for host Palmdale in the Northern Division game. 
</P>
<P>
With San Fernando leading, 10-9, Palmdale rallied for a run in the eighth to 
tie the score before winning it in the ninth. Steve Tellis singled in the 
ninth, advanced to second on a sacrifice fly and scored on Gravois' single. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Corrales gave up two runs and four hits in relief of Hector De La Cruz, 
who went seven innings to suffer the loss. Corrales also had two home runs, a 
double, a single and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill 18, Studio City 16 -- Roy Brown hit a pair of three-run home runs 
and had seven RBIs, and Jason Haner pitched two shutout innings in relief for 
host Quartz Hill.

innings. Brian Lovelace was four for four with two RBIs and two doubles and Rob 
Keller added two hits for Quartz Hill. 
</P>

Joe Contrearez doubled, tripled and homered for Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi 22, West Hills 5 -- Encino-Crespi parlayed two walks and six hits

MISTAKES MAR HART TITLE EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
NORMALLY RELIABLE TOLEDO COMMITS 3 ERRORS AT THIRD BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High third baseman Dave Toledo removed the dusty cap from his head and 
stashed it in his duffel bag, never really noticing that the bill was covered 
in the reddish dirt that lines the warning track and areas fronting the dugouts 
at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time the dirt, which actually comes from crushed brick, also was 
used on the basepaths. It was removed several years ago, however, because it 
tended to make major league ground balls carom around like a golf ball on 
asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
And like wet clay, the dirt sticks to nearly everything, which is more than 
could be said about the ball and the gloves Hart players wore. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's game against Cerritos, in fact, the normally sure-handed senior 
and his teammates fielded like a collective brick wall in a 4-1 loss in the 
Southern Section 4-A Division final. 
</P>
<P>
"One after another, (the mistakes) got into my head," Toledo said, tapping an 
index finger to his temple. "After a while, I thought, 'Hell, don't even hit me 
the ball any more.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a fateful fourth inning, it seemed like the ground balls never stopped 
coming his way. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo, who committed only five errors in Hart's previous 29 games, twice 
kicked the ball in the fourth, leading to a pair of unearned runs against 
junior left-hander Andrew Lorraine (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
After three scoreless innings, Cerritos' Steve Hayes opened the fourth with a 
bloop double to left. Toledo and Hart shortstop Robby Davis tracked the fly 
ball near the foul line, but it was jarred from Davis' glove when the two 
became entangled trying to make the grab. 
</P>
<P>
"I was calling, but we couldn't hear anything," Toledo said. "He had it in his 
glove, but it snow-coned and fell out." 
</P>
<P>
Snow-coned, for the uninitiated, means only about half of the ball was in the 
glove's webbing. Immediately thereafter, Hart went into a deep, deep, defensive 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Tony Cuoto drilled a ground ball at Toledo. The ball ricocheted 
off the third baseman's chest, and, in his haste to nail Cuoto at first, he 
chucked the ball near the photographers' well for an error. Hayes scored to 
give Cerritos a 1-0 lead and Cuoto moved to second on the overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Nelson followed with a similar shot at Toledo, who fielded the chopper 
cleanly but threw a torpedo in the dirt past Ray Gardocki at first. Hayes 
waltzed in from second to give Cerritos a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo booted another ground ball in the sixth, just before Lorraine gave Hart 
its fourth error of the game on an errant pickoff throw to first. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine said that he felt sorrow, not anger, for Toledo, who spent several 
minutes after the game standing alone at the far end of the Hart locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"He's saved me a hundred times," Lorraine said. "I can't narrow it down to 
things like that. It was a lot of things. We had no luck at all today, and one 
little thing just seemed to keep turning into a big inning." 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, Cerritos scored two earned runs off Lorraine to take a 4-0 lead. 
With a modicum of execution, however, only one run might have crossed the 
plate. With runners on first and second with one out and one run in, Mark 
Mattingly sent a made-to-order, double-play ground ball to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis failed to glove the ball cleanly, however, and Hart settled for a force 
at second. One pitch later, Curt Knabe stole home to give Cerritos (27-7) a 4-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like our defense was trying to do way too many things," Toledo said of 
the Indians, who after 5 1/2 innings had as many errors (four) as base hits. 
"Too many things -- instead of doing things right." 
</P>
<P>
Toledo tried to square his account with Lorraine in the bottom of the fifth -- 
when the Indians (23-7) scored their lone run -- by contributing a double off 
the left-field fence. But it would not prove to be a storybook night: Toledo 
took a called strike three in the seventh for the game's final out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad all that had to happen to that kid," Hart Coach Bud Murray said. 
"You can't judge him on what happened tonight. He had a great year." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Toledo finished with a .380 batting average and 27 RBIs, but 
you can bet he would trade a hit or two for a routine defensive play Saturday. 
Toledo said that he wished he could erase the night from his memory, but he 
knows it won't soon go away. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous, and it wasn't really that hard to see," he said. "It was 
like I went blank or something." 
</P>
<P>
Or like he hit a brick wall.

DIGEST: CAL LUTHERAN KICKER SIGNS WITH BEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kent Sullivan, the second all-time leading punter in Cal Lutheran history, has 
signed with the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
In four years at Cal Lutheran, Sullivan had 240 punts for an average of 38.4 
yards. Also a kicker, Sullivan set school records for longest field goal (52 
yards) and longest punt (74 yards) last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 25, is scheduled to report to the Bears' training camp in 
Platteville, Wis., on July 6. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge product Bryan Wagner was the Bears' punter last season, 
but he was claimed by the Cleveland Browns when the Bears left him on the 
unprotected list. 
</P>
<P>
John Tomac of Chatsworth finished 20th in the sixth stage of the Milk Run 
cycling race Saturday, covering the 106-mile Barnsley-to-Liverpool course in 
England in 4 hours, 1 minute, 18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac stands ninth overall, 38 seconds behind Briton Nigel Bishop. Bishop was 
credited with the same time as Tomac on Saturday and has a composite time of 24 
hours, 40 minutes, 12 seconds.

WYNYATE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Evelyn De Wolfe's Then and Now (April 30) on the Wynyate house in 
South Pasadena: 
</P>
<P>
My family and I lived in Wynyate for several years before moving to Arizona in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
For many, many months we chipped and peeled paint after school. Cindy (my 
sister) and I were issued scrapers to remove the layers of gold, black and 
white paint from the fabulous redwood wainscoting, fireplaces, window sills and 
staircases. 
</P>
<P>
One summer while we were away at camp, my parents hired a crew of craftsmen to 
burn and peel the thick, aging gray paint off the exterior of the house. The 
project took a whole summer. When we came home, the house was a lovely lavender 
and white. One of the remodels that your article did not mention was the 
kitchen. It was enlarged and literally gutted and fitted with new wood 
flooring, cabinets and built-in appliances. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of building the house in 1887, according to original documents left by 
the Grahams, was $11,000. The price paid by my parents to restore the house was 
upward of $200,000. The value of the many remembrances shared by my family we 
hold priceless.

ENJOYS HIS READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is simply to let you and your staff know that I truly enjoy reading 
the Real Estate section. As a homeowner, I find the tips on house maintenance 
and repair to be quite useful, and I especially look forward to the Q &amp; A 
section on buying and selling real estate. This section always has a wealth of 
information for anyone who wishes to purchase or sell his own home. 
</P>
<P>

The Compton City Council must find new sources of revenue or cut costs by about 
$11 million to produce a balanced city budget in the next fiscal year, City 
Manager James Goins said during a recent council budget session. A headline on 
a May 25 story in The Times' Long Beach section implied that the city's budget 
already has a deficit.

The Times said in a Thursday editorial that Julie Korenstein, a member of the 
Los Angeles School Board, gathered 57 votes more than challenger Gerald E. 
Horowitz in April. The correct statistic is that she fell only 57 votes short 
of a majority that would have avoided a runoff Tuesday.

Accompanying Tony Aliengena on his historic flight around the world will be an 
entourage of 17 people, including his family and journalists from the United 
States and Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Five passengers will be seated in Tony's single-engine Cessna Centurion. The 
other members of the entourage will ride in two chase planes. 
</P>
<P>
IN TONY'S CESSNA 
</P>
<P>
His father, Gary Aliengena, 39, a certified pilot who owns the plane. 
Aliengena, a real estate investor and truck transportation broker, taught Tony 
to fly and will be riding in the co-pilot's seat for the duration of the 
flight. Aliengena is an avid hunter and fisherman who frequently flies his 
family to its mountaintop retreat in southern Utah. He also helps coach Tony's 
Little League baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Susan Aliengena, 39, a homemaker, has been in charge of such details as 
obtaining Soviet visas for all of the Americans going on the trip. She is 
active in civic affairs in the family's hometown of San Juan Capistrano, where 
she has served as co-chairman of the local PTA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His 9-year-old sister, Alaina, who attends third grade at Prentice Day School 
in Newport Beach. Alaina helped put together a 1,000-foot "friendship" scroll 
that is to be presented to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tony's Soviet pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh, 10, who flew to Orange County on 
Saturday to meet the Aliengena family and is to accompany them for the duration 
of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gunter Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from Malibu who is going along as an 
official observer for the National Aeronautic Assn., the U.S. sanctioning body 
for all world and national aviation records. Hagen, a longtime private pilot, 
will be on hand to verify whether Tony remains in sole control of the aircraft 
throughout the 17,500-mile flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN CHASE PLANE 
</P>
<P>
Riding in a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air, which will carry spare parts and 
luggage, will be: 
</P>
<P>
Lance Allyn, an orthopedic surgeon from Fresno who owns the King Air and will 
be piloting it for all but one week of the journey. During the third week of 
the trip, when the entourage enters the Soviet Union, Allyn has plans to fly 
commercially back to the United States and attend his daughter's wedding in 
Boston. He will relinquish control of the aircraft during that time to Garry 
Zinger, a private pilot from Visalia. Allyn will rejoin the trip in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guy Murrel, 28, a public relations consultant from Costa Mesa who has been 
serving as coordinator of Friendship Flight '89, the project under which Tony 
is flying around the world. During the flight, Murrel will be coordinating 
press conferences and public events involving the entourage. He will fly part 
of the time in the chase plane and part of the time in a commercial jet to 
prepare advance work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Soviet journalists. Maxin Chikin, of the newspaper Pravda, and Alexei 
Grinevich, of a Soviet magazine, who will be filing dispatches along the way to 
the Soviet Union, where there is already intense public curiosity about a boy 
who would try to fly a plane around the world. The two journalists were due to 
arrive in Orange County on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jim Carlton, 33, of Laguna Beach, a reporter for The Times' Orange County 
Edition.

ON A CLEAN DAY, YOU CAN SEE THE HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a dirty job and nobody had to do it, really. 
</P>
<P>
But swept away by a sense of civic pride and the promise of a party, about 300 
volunteers spent Saturday morning gathering, raking and bagging 7 tons of trash 
in and around Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to do it. But if you live and work on the bay, you want to 
protect it and make it as enjoyable as you can," said Vicki Michalczyk, owner 
of the Balboa Boat Yard and an area director for the Newport Beach Chamber of 
Commerce, which sponsored the ninth annual Clean Harbor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Debris collectors fanned out as early as 8 a.m. in 15 boats and walking groups 
while City Council members Clarence J. Turner, Evelyn R. Hart and Ruthelyn 
Plummer boarded an 
</P>
<P>
'You don't have to do it. But if you live and work on the bay, you want to 
protect it and make it as enjoyable as you can.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vicki Michalczyk, 
</P>
<P>
owner of the Balboa Boat Yard 
</P>
<P>
observation boat. They later returned dockside to join supporters -- including 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) -- who gathered 
</P>
<P>
at the Cannery restaurant, which provided free soda and hot dogs, march and 
bagpipe music and a no-host bar. 
</P>
<P>
Returning trash collectors included 20 members of the Young Republicans of 
Orange County, the Kiwanis Club, 10 Scouts from Troop 90 of the Sea Scout base 
in Newport and individuals such as businessman Mark Hart, whose motorboat 
Hartless nearly sank with 30 sacks of trash on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We forgot to put the plug in it," explained a chagrined Hart. He said that 
after motoring off Balboa Island picking up trash with a dozen 
</P>
<P>
comrades, he noticed that the water in the boat was ankle deep. "Then it was 
shin deep. Then it looked like it was going to be knee deep. The engines were 
flooded and the battery was dead." 
</P>
<P>
In view of partying supporters, Hart and his friend Mary Pat Earl bailed water 
until they themselves were bailed out by the Harbor Patrol. They returned later 
to pick up hot dogs, a lost dog and their Big Dipper award, given out with 
other mostly tongue-in-cheek honors. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Russell, an insurance salesman in red sunglasses, said his crew filled 15 
bags of plastic trash, cigarette butts, bottle caps and other junk stuck in 
seaweed. "It's a jungle out there. I've never seen so much stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The trash take was less than previous years, organizers said. One reason is 
that the cleanup was held earlier than usual, before the summer tourist season 
really builds. The state Department of Fish and Game also barred trash seekers 
from land areas where birds are nesting. 
</P>
<P>
Most volunteers used fishing nets or rakes to pick up trash in the oily water, 
but Cannery owner Bill Hamilton puttered through the bay demonstrating his 
invention, the Water Rake -- a converted catamaran he designed to suck up 
floating junk or even sick birds. He said he hopes to sell a revised model with 
an oil extractor to the city for $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It really works!" said Bill Von Henkle, the cleanup's chairman. "It picks up 
cigarettes and little tiny things. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, 64, recalled childhood vacations spent in Newport when the bay was so 
clean that he had no qualms about swimming in it. Thoughtless visitors dumping 
trash in the harbor and in the streets whose gutters lead to the harbor have 
sometimes made it a watery junk pile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His restaurant sits at the end of the dead-end harbor where the trash winds up, 
lapping against the pilings for weeks, said Hamilton, who has spearheaded 
cleanup day for nine years. Not only is the trash an eyesore for customers, but 
it is damaging to birds and boats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic is the worst, he said, because it "lasts forever." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, workers said, is runoff containing fertilizers from nurseries 
upstream that has encouraged green moss to grow in the harbor. But cooperating 
nurseries that agreed to recycle their runoff have alleviated the problem, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main idea is to get public awareness lifted so we don't have to do it," he 
said. This year, he said, the chamber will sponsor a second cleanup day 
sometime before Sept. 15, the start of a 10-day Seafest that is expected to 
draw 50,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The annual event has become a minor fund-raiser for the chamber as a result of 
financial donations from banks, home builders, businesses and community 
organizations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he plans to keep hosting cleanup days "until the bay is so clean 
we don't need it anymore." That day, he predicted, will probably never arrive.

UCI TO REJECT WOMEN IN LABOR WHEN FACILITIES FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCI Medical Center, saying the health of its patients is threatened by 
overcrowding, will turn away women in labor when both its emergency room and 
obstetrics unit are full. 
</P>
<P>
Although the medical center has the capacity "to safely deliver" 250 babies a 
month, "for the past several months (it) has been delivering at or above 500" 
babies a month, according to a letter delineating the policy change that was 
signed by hospital executive director Mary A. Piccione and Dr. Thomas J. 
Garite, acting chair of obstetrics and gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Garite said, has been women laboring on stretchers in hallways, as 
well as some "bad outcomes" for mothers or babies when Cesarean sections had to 
be delayed because no delivery room was available. In one case, he said, an 
urgently needed Cesarean was delayed 90 minutes and the baby ended up in the 
intensive care unit with respiratory complications. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep coming to UCIMC with no prenatal care and from the (Orange County) 
health department because they've heard this is a good place to have their 
babies. What we're telling them is that this is a very unsafe place at this 
time," Garite said. 
</P>
<P>
To avert what Garite fears will be "a disaster," medical center officials will 
no longer always accept every woman "in active labor" who comes to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 May Be Unprecedented in UC System 
</P>
<P>
Instead, according to the new policy, which may be unprecedented in the UC 
system, women in active labor will be directed to other hospitals when the 
medical center obstetrical unit is full and the hospital emergency room is on 
"bypass" -- full and no longer accepting ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
However, even when the medical center enters "obstetrical diversion," the 
hospital will still give priority admissions to women in labor who have 
received prenatal care at the medical center, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Garite said he wanted other hospitals to share the responsibility of caring for 
these obstetrical patients. Medical center officials have estimated that 90% of 
the women in labor that the medical center treats are indigent and that most 
have received no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Garite and Piccione's letter was mailed or delivered Friday evening to other 
medical center officials and to county health clinics, hospitals and ambulance 
companies. A copy of the letter was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the news was difficult to gauge Saturday, but a leading hospitals 
representative questioned the new policy's legality. 
</P>
<P>
"This seems to be really on the edge" of the law, said Jon Gilwee, vice 
president of the Hospital Council of Southern California. Gilwee said hospitals 
are required under state law to care for patients in an emergency situation -- 
"and active labor is certainly one." 
</P>
<P>
Gilwee also questioned how successful the diversion effort would be when 
"everybody (every Orange County hospital administrator) is dealing with a 
situation of uncompensated care and indigent patients." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Reverberation in Crisis 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was clear Saturday that the medical center's decision to start 
turning away some patients was the latest reverberation in a continuing crisis 
over health care in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years, local hospitals have complained that they have been 
saturated with indigent patients. Some have refused to renew Medi-Cal 
contracts, saying they are not sufficiently compensated when they care for poor 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, medical center officials have protested the loudest, saying 
poor patients, shunted to their former county hospital in Orange, have made 
teaching and research increasingly difficult. The officials have argued that 
they care for 65% of the county's poor with only about 6% of the hospital beds. 
</P>
<P>
And citing those problems and a deficit expected to reach $13 million this 
fiscal year, medical center officials in March threatened to withdraw from the 
Medi-Cal system. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials are expected to announce later this week whether they will 
continue their contract. 
</P>
<P>
Garite, meanwhile, said the new policy on women in labor had nothing to do with 
continuing negotiations involving the state commission that sets Medi-Cal 
reimbursement rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to make a statement," he said. "I'm trying to safely take care 
of my patients. If that results in action by other hospitals or a state agency, 
so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the main problem cited by Piccione and Garite in Friday's letter is also 
a key issue in the Medi-Cal negotiations: overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center, with three delivery rooms, three emergency beds and 11 
labor beds, is sometimes filled with more than 25 patients a day, Garite said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do women labor on stretchers in the hallways, but they labor in the 
obstetrics unit waiting room because there are no beds available, said B. J. 
Snell, associate director of nursing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many numbers we're concerned we're not going to be able to get 
women in and be evaluated. We're concerned she'll be in the waiting room when 
she has her baby. . . . There have been times that when we finally get them in 
(from the waiting room), they are so far dilated that they have their babies 
within 10 minutes," Snell said. 
</P>
<P>
Snell and Garite both said they worried that women with high-risk deliveries 
might not be evaluated quickly enough to help them because there are not always 
the nursing staff or beds to go round. 
</P>
<P>
That congestion not only perils laboring mothers but threatens the safe care of 
the medical center's smallest babies, who are cared for in Orange County's most 
sophisticated neonatal care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Because the neonatal unit is so often full, some babies sometimes have to be 
referred to other hospitals, Garite said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Garite and Piccione's letter, "this overcrowding in the delivery 
rooms carries over to the nursery and even to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. 
The result is that we cannot guarantee patient safety under such conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Garite said the letter explaining these conditions puts other hospitals and 
clinics on notice that the medical center will not tolerate them shunting all 
patients in labor to the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
"We are requesting health care providers in Orange County to cease and desist 
from issuing maps to individuals showing only UCIMC as the hospital for 
obstetrical services," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Garite said that this statement was not meant to be "vindictive" but that he 
and Piccione were concerned that some hospitals and Orange County Health Care 
Agency clinics often give laboring patients a map showing them how to get to 
the medical center. The county clinics offer prenatal care but do not perform 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Go somewhere to have your baby.' " Garite said. 
</P>
<P>
But now, he continued, the medical center should not be considered the only 
place to go. 
</P>
<P>
Garite said he anguished over the new policy. "I have great anxiety about this. 
. . . I wouldn't be doing this without being afraid someone may have a 
complication who's being turned away" from the medical center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Wise 
</P>
<P>
"But what if they continue to have bad outcomes in my delivery room? When you 
have 25 patients in labor and delivery (in one day) in a unit that's safely 
capable of taking half that many? You know from experience in obstetrics that 
you're waiting for a disaster to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Garite said he hoped laboring women would get the word from clinics and other 
hospitals that they can "turn around and go to a hospital that will more safely 
take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope other people will get wise to the system," he said, because "their 
health-care system is breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
Starting at 5 p.m. Friday night, the medical center broadcast to other 
hospitals that it was on its first "obstetrical diversion," Garite said. At 
that time, however, the only laboring patients who came to the hospital center 
were women who had received their prenatal care at the medical center, so they 
were all admitted. He said the hospital went off the obstetrical "deflection" 
about 11 p.m. Friday.

APPARENT FALL FROM 2ND STORY KILLS TEXAN VISITING NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old Texas man was fatally injured Saturday when he apparently fell 
off a second-story balcony while visiting friends in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cleon Lee Warren, of Austin, had been visiting friends at a residence in the 
1700 block of West Balboa Avenue about 3 a.m. when he went onto the balcony to 
smoke a cigarette, Newport Beach Sgt. Gene Senecal said. 
</P>
<P>
When Warren had not returned after several minutes, someone went onto the 
balcony to look for him but saw him unconscious on the pavement, 18 feet below, 
Senecal said.

PEGASUS RISES ON THE WINGS, UH LEGS, OF PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It was about 2 a.m. Saturday when eight UC Irvine engineering students 
converged on a campus athletic field to assemble the human-powered airplane 
they worked all year to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
By the light of fluorescent lamps powered through yards of orange extension 
cords, the students joined the tail boom to the fuselage, attached the 
propeller, assembled six wing sections and covered most of the aircraft with 
transparent Mylar. 
</P>
<P>
Before daybreak, there it was: Pegasus, its 100-foot-long single wing suspended 
like a giant white ruler against a backdrop of trees. And despite a soggy 
morning and a series of mechanical failures, the ungainly aircraft powered by a 
fast-pedaling cyclist actually got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear the wheels on the ground and then all of a sudden there's nothing 
between you and the ground," said team member Jeanne Pandes, 22, who piloted 
the plane on its first short flights. "You're cruising." 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is the third and most successful attempt by UC Irvine mechanical 
engineering students to construct a human-powered airplane as a senior project. 
The 1987 airplane, dubbed the UC Medfly, crashed almost immediately after 
leaving the ground. Last year's 
</P>
<P>
plane, UC-ME-FLY ("you see me fly"), succeeded in making flights of close to 
300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus team used wing sections from UC-ME-FLY, but built a new, more 
aerodynamic fuselage that reduced the airplane's weight from 135 pounds to 120 
pounds, said project leader Greg Hill, 23. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-foot-long aircraft is made of balsa wood, sturdy carbon fiber tubing and 
transparent Mylar, a plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is one of eight senior projects in the mechanical engineering 
department, whose students also designed a human-powered car and a 
human-powered hydrofoil, both of which are scheduled to make their debut Monday 
morning in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 a.m. Saturday, the weather was a major source of anxiety for the 
Pegasus team. An infrequent drizzle covered the wings with a film of water, 
which one student patiently scraped off with a yellow squeegee. Because of the 
wing's large surface area, Hill estimated that the drizzle added about 10 
pounds to the airplane's weight. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing black tights, white tennis shoes and a Pegasus T-shirt, Pandes crawled 
into the triangular cockpit and experimented with the pedals. The covered 
cockpit bore the advertising logos of the dozen companies that donated about 
$8,000 to build Pegasus. 
</P>
<P>
The team positioned itself for the takeoff, one student holding up the end of 
each wing and several more supporting the fuselage and tail. Pandes began 
pedaling and Pegasus quivered unsteadily from nose to tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go, Jeanne," one student urged the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft lifted off the ground, traveling perhaps 15 feet, then one of the 
wires holding the wings to the fuselage snapped. The students repaired the wire 
and tried again. Pandes piloted the airplane for four more flights, the longest 
of which was about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pegasus needed more power. So the second pilot, amateur cyclist Arcadio 
Biboso, was called in. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in yellow and black Spandex, Biboso's powerful legs lifted Pegasus on a 
60-foot flight. But he reported a problem with the pedaling mechanism -- the 
chain linking the pedals to the propeller shaft kept jerking, causing the 
airplane to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The team discussed ways to correct the problem and, in a last-ditch effort, 
attached a chain-tightening device with quick-drying epoxy glue and some 
string. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, with Biboso at the controls, Pegasus made its longest 
flight ever: nearly 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The next attempt was even more successful, with the airplane staying aloft for 
more than 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But as Pegasus was landing, the right wing hit the ground and snapped in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
In a post-mortem of Pegasus' flight, Hill mourned that "these wings are so 
long, so fragile . . . but that the plane has stayed together through all these 
rough landings says something for us, I guess."

MOUNTAIN LIONS' ODDS ON HAVING CUBS IMPROVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The recent discovery of four female mountain lions -- one possibly pregnant -- 
in north Orange County may mean the cats have a better chance of producing 
offspring in the rapidly developing region than researchers once believed. 
</P>
<P>
The four adult females were captured in the past two weeks in the foothills of 
the Santa Ana Mountains north of Santiago Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lion who may be pregnant, another appears to have mated 
recently, meaning at least one male lion has established a presence in the 
area, according to Paul Beier, a wildlife biologist who heads the Orange County 
Cooperative Mountain Lion Study. The two-year research project, funded by the 
county, was begun after lions mauled children in two separate attacks in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The four recently captured were tagged, fitted with radio collars and released 
so that their behavior can be studied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Optimistic Picture' 
</P>
<P>
"This is good news," Beier said, referring to the possible matings. "This gives 
us a more optimistic picture of reproduction in the (mountain lion) 
population." 
</P>
<P>
Beier said as many as 35 lions may roam foothills and canyons in the Santa Ana 
Mountains. In 1988, researchers found and tagged four adult cats in Ronald W. 
Caspers Regional Park, a 7,500-acre recreation area, where the two 1986 
maulings took place. 
</P>
<P>
But the mating patterns of these lions, all females, caused some dismay among 
scientists. One of the females is traveling with two yearlings, but the other 
three have shown no reproductive activity for more than a year, Beier said. 
</P>
<P>
The four captured recently were found in Blind and Fremont canyons, a rugged 
area of mountains, grassland and chaparral owned by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Although cattle ranchers use the area for grazing, no stock has been reported 
lost to the lions. 
</P>
<P>
Beier said there are occasional sightings of the big cats on Santiago Canyon 
Road. An adult and a kitten were found dead on the road early this year. 
However, there have been no reports of attacks or encroachments in residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers expanded their original study boundary from Caspers Park to north 
county in mid-May because the area encompasses land that is destined to become 
county wilderness parks. 
</P>
<P>
"The county would like information about how the lions use these habitats so 
that when these areas become parks we can use the land in a way that minimizes 
the encounters between humans and animals," Beier said. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers believe the Caspers Park lions travel over a large area of 
terrain that takes in parts of Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties, the 
range of the north county lions has yet to be determined, Beier said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers would also like to know where the cats hunt, what they eat, how 
they behave at the edge of developed areas -- for example, do they venture into 
areas of heavy construction activity? -- and the points at which they cross 
Santiago Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Beier said he is working on a proposal to extend the mountain lion study, 
scheduled to expire in February, for another three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need another three to five years to answer the questions the county 
wants answered," Beier said. "Right now, we think the lions are doing OK, but 
we would like to make sure."

LAGUNA HILLS CANDIDATES UNITED ON TWO ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 14 candidates who want to be elected to the city council of Laguna Hills, 
if such a city is formed, agree on one thing: Stop plans to build a large 
business park that would dump 42,000 vehicles a day on already-congested roads 
and prevent commercial use of the airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll taken at a candidates forum at Leisure World last week, all 13 
candidates present said they would oppose a plan to change the zoning from 
recreation and open space to commercial on 192 acres next to the retirement 
community. 
</P>
<P>
One candidate, Bernard Kuai, said his opposition was "qualified," meaning that 
he believes that the city will have to settle for a compromise with the 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
And Karl Gustav Schneider II, who was absent from the forum because of upcoming 
hand surgery, said later that he also believes that, in reality, some kind of 
development will occur. But he said he believes that as a city, Laguna Hills 
would be in a better position to negotiate a less-intense development plan. 
</P>
<P>
All 14 candidates also oppose the addition of commercial jet flights at the El 
Toro Marine base, although they differ as to whether they believe that the 
opposition of the new city would significantly influence the decisions of 
county and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The most fundamental difference among the candidates is their support or 
opposition to the campaign to make Laguna Hills a city. 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates -- Dr. William A. Honigman, Kuai, Leon A. Bosch and Bea Hassel 
Rogatz -- want to quash the cityhood drive, although they say they would be 
willing to serve on a council if a city is formed. Bosch and Rogatz, both from 
Leisure World, contend that the retirement community does not stand to reap any 
benefits from incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
While they have taken similar stances on the issues that mean most to the local 
voters, the candidates differ broadly in political and professional experience. 
</P>
<P>
They include: 
</P>
<P>
* Philip S. Borden, a Laguna Hills resident, is an investor and dean of 
business administration at California Coast University. A former business 
executive and professor, he has masters and doctorate degrees from the Harvard 
Business School.

operates the retirement community's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
* Melody Carruth, a Nellie Gail housewife, is a former teacher and founder and 
former co-chairwoman of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, a group that has 
advocated the formation of a Laguna Hills city. She is also a member of Airport 
Site Consensus, a regional group of volunteers that is trying to prevent 
commercial use of the Marine airport in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
* James Dukette has worked in Orange County government since 1970. Since 1981, 
he has been an administrator at the Orange County Agency on Aging. He is past 
president of a homeowners association in Laguna Niguel and an Air Force 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
* Norman F. Garton, a retired Navy rear admiral, serves on committees of three 
homeowners associations in Leisure World, including the Golden Rain Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
* Janice Graham, a former teacher and operator of a bed-and-breakfast inn, is 
an educational consultant. She is a board member of the Saddleback Area 
Coordinating Council and past president of a county League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
* Patricia Ann Gummeson is a vice president of Mercury Property Management 
Inc., a property management company, a director of the Laguna Village 
Homeowners Assn. and area adviser to Citizens to Save Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>

Laguna Hills. He ran as a city council candidate in opposition to a previous 
proposal to form a regional city of Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* Allan Songstad, an attorney specializing in civil business litigation, was 
also a co-chairman of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, and is president of the

WHITE'S CONTRIBUTIONS OUTWEIGH HIS LAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angel busybody Devon White had one of those rare nights when he didn't know 
whether to cherish or forget his contributions to a 4-3 victory over the Kansas 
City Royals at Anaheim Stadium Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On the cherish side were White's three hits -- two singles and a double -- 
which helped push his average up to .299. He scored once. He flustered Royal 
starter Charlie Leibrandt into heaving a pickoff throw into foul territory. He 
stole a base, his 21st in a young season. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, a perfectly wonderful evening until you recount White's pair of 
mid-game adventures. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, he was caught stealing after one of those singles. Later, White 
tried snaring a sinking line drive off the grass blades. He missed and two 
Royal runs scored to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
So what to do: applaud or sadly shake your head? 
</P>
<P>
Probably applaud; the Angels did. 
</P>
<P>
Without White they wouldn't have had at least one of those four runs. The 
circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
White singled between third and shortstop to begin the third inning. With 20 
stolen bases already to White's credit, Leibrandt was obliged to keep an eye on 
him at first. 
</P>
<P>
So he did, lobbing ball after ball to first baseman Pat Tabler, all in hopes of 
keeping White put. 
</P>
<P>
It nearly worked. White had cut his lead down slightly when Leibrandt unleashed 
another throw in the general direction of Tabler. 
</P>
<P>
But this time Tabler was shielded by White and the ball whizzed past his glove 
and into foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White motored all the way to third base and later scored easily on 
Wally Joyner's single. 
</P>
<P>
White was back at first in the fourth inning, too, courtesy of another ground 
ball single that scooted past shortstop Kurt Stillwell. This time he took his 
lead and was off as Leibrandt apparently began his motion toward home. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. Leibrandt instead threw to Tabler at first, who threw to second in 
time to catch a surprised White. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a balk," White said of Leibrandt's move. "I still think it's a balk. His 
motion was going toward the plate." 
</P>
<P>
If it was, none of the four umpires objected. In the scorebook, White's attempt 
simply went down as a caught stealing. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the sixth, White was again the center of attention. With Kevin 
Seitzer on second and the fleet-footed Bo Jackson on first, Tabler hit a line 
drive toward mid-center field. White charged. 
</P>
<P>
"I went after that ball because I thought we could get out of the inning," he 
said. "I thought I (had it), but then the ball really dipped." 
</P>
<P>
A possible out suddenly became a sure-fire double as the ball bounced in front 
of White and then off his glove toward right field. Dante Bichette retrieved 
the ball and threw toward home, but not in time to get Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew (Jackson) was going, no doubt," Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
The throw made it as far as Wally Joyner, who then relayed it to catcher Lance 
Parrish. Too late. 
</P>
<P>
"A regular human being wouldn't have scored," White said in admiration of 
Jackson's speed. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, said Bichette, a regular human being wouldn't have come close to 
Tabler's line drive in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody could have caught it, Devo could have," he said.

PITCHING, DEFENSE GIVE KENNEDY PERFECT ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were no errors for Kennedy High School Saturday, only perfection. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish defeated Saugus, 1-0, in nine innings at Dodger Stadium to 
win the Southern Section 3-A baseball championship. They did so by relying on 
their strengths -- pitching and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hansell supplied the pitching, allowing five hits and striking out 10, 
including the first six batters. 
</P>
<P>
When Hansell did allow someone to actually hit the ball, his defense was there 
to lend a hand. The Fighting Irish did not make an error; the Centurions 
committed two, including one that led to Kennedy's run. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching and defense has carried us all season," Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal 
said. "This was nothing new today." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's solid play in the field was highlighted by shortstop Steve Rath and 
third baseman Paul Ruark. But it was Todd Murakami, a reserve outfielder, who 
made the biggest play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the seventh, Saugus had runners on first and second when Scott 
Warr sliced a foul ball down the left-field line. Murakami, who had replaced 
Scott Ethington an inning earlier, gave chase. The ball hit his glove about the 
same time his knee hit the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone froze, including pinch-runner Jayme Riggio, who has halfway between 
second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Murakami raised his glove to show he'd made the catch, threw the ball back to 
the infield, then collapsed in pain. The runners went back to their bases. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw the fence until I hit it," Murakami said. "I knew I was hurt, but 
I was more worried about the runners. So I got the ball back to the infield and 
then worried about myself." 
</P>
<P>
Murakami was then surrounded by a doctor, a trainer and Pascal. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pascal: "We got out there and Todd is saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't 
breathe.' We started looking at his ribs and he said, 'It's my knee.' " 
</P>
<P>
Murakami left the game with a bruised knee. His play was one of four that kept 
the Fighting Irish tied. But it was, by far, the most spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, he literally sacrificed his body for the team," Rath said. 
"That's what playing defense is all about. That play fired us up." 
</P>
<P>
Rath followed Murakami's catch with a defensive gem of his own. 
</P>
<P>
With runners still on first and second, Glenn Terry hit a line drive toward 
left field. Rath moved to his right, snagged the ball and flipped it to second 
to double off Riggio. End of inning, end of threat. 
</P>
<P>
Rath also made a running catch on a shallow fly to take a hit away from Roger 
Salkeld in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye," Pascal said. "He sometimes does 
things that I don't like and I sometimes do things he doesn't like. But when 
it's time to play, he plays his butt off." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Saugus had a runner on second with two outs. J.B. Johnson hit a 
hard grounder between Ruark and the third-base bag. 
</P>
<P>
Ruark dived to his right and smothered the ball. Although he threw late to 
first base, he prevented a run from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul saved our butts right there," Pascal said. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell struck out the next batter to end the inning.

COVINA STOPS MISSION VIEJO ON THREE HITS

<P>
Mission Viejo High School entered Saturday's Southern Section 3-A softball 
championship game hoping to pull off one more surprise. 
</P>
<P>
But the unseeded Diablos -- an at-large team -- ran out of luck against 
second-seeded and undefeated Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Covina's Mary Letourneau (24-0-1) pitched a three-hitter with 12 strikeouts to 
lead the Colts to a 2-0 victory at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played really well, we just didn't generate any offense," Diablo 
Coach Jeff Cunningham said. "She did a lot of things we expected, only she did 
them better." 
</P>
<P>
Amy Bond, one of three Diablos to reach base, said: "She had nice rise and nice 
drop, and she threw them both when we were expecting the opposite."

Letourneau, who came into the game with an 0.12 earned-run average, recorded 
her 17th shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Covina got to Mission Viejo starting pitcher Erin Fitzgerald (12-5) for four 
hits and the two runs, and reliever Kerin Dull for three hits. The Diablos 
played outstanding defense to keep the score as close as it was. 
</P>
<P>
Dull, a sophomore, replaced Fitzgerald to start the third after the starter 
aggravated a back injury while warming up before the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt it before the (second round) of the La Mirada game," said Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second inning, I started to have pain in my lower left side and it 
spread. (By the third), it shot all the way across my back. It just really 
hurt.' 
</P>
<P>
Covina scored its runs in the second inning. After Bond made a diving catch on 
a line drive to center field by Letourneau, Lea Hollister and April Ruedaflores 
singled. 
</P>
<P>
Cassy Hollister then a hit ground ball to shortstop. Jennifer Ward tried to 
force Hollister at third but her throw tailed over the third baseman's head. 
Lea Hollister scored on the error and Ruedaflores took third. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald then struck out Dawn Sawyer but Hollister stole second. r Cindy 
Escobedo hit a single up the middle to score Ruedaflores to make it 2-0 before 
Sherrie Ward flied out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"She was hurting in the first and second innings," Cunningham said of 
Fitzgerald. "I think if I had known, I might have made the (pitching) change 
then." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's best scoring opportunity also came in the second. Designated 
hitter Michelle Daugherty singled to right field and was sacrificed to second 
by Tamar deFries but she could get no farther. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth with one away, Letourneau reached on a fielder's choice and 
advanced on Lea Hollister's ground out. Ruedaflores then hit a bloop single to 
center field. Bond charged the hit, wound up and let go with a throw to the 
plate that arrived before Letourneau even had a chance to slide. Catcher 
deFries tagged her out to prevent the run. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls have done a great job," said Cunningham. "They have nothing to be 
ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
The farthest the Diablos (18-11) had advanced previously was to the semifinals 
five years ago, he said.

The Southern Section 3-A division championship game Saturday at Dodger Stadium 
was advertised as a "King of the Hill" duel between pitchers Greg Hansell of 
Kennedy High School and Roger Salkeld of Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, ranked as the sixth-best prep pitching prospect in the nation by the 
publication Baseball America, had struck out 162 batters with a 90-mile-an-hour 
fastball and had allowed only nine earned runs in chalking up 12 victories 
without a loss. Hansell had struck out 113 batters and completed 10 games en 
route to a 12-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld and Hansell engaged in an arms race for eight innings, each allowing 
four hits and striking out nine. Finally, in the bottom of the ninth inning, 
Hansell scored on a wild pitch and Kennedy had won its first baseball title in 
the school's 25-year history with a 1-0 extra-inning victory. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld threw a wild pitch on a 2-1 count to Kennedy's No. 8 hitter, Don 
Cochran, ending a classic matchup between two of Southern California's best 
prep pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (26-5) capped a year of transition in which the Fighting Irish 
developed into one of Orange County's premier programs under Coach Chris Pascal 
after struggling to win three games in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus (23-5-2) was shut out for the first time in 1989 as Kennedy's pitching 
staff recorded its 20th consecutive complete game. It also marked the second 
time Saugus has lost a championship game in the past four years; in 1986, 
Artesia beat Saugus, 9-4, in the 2-A title game. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a classic championship game," Pascal said. "Greg went with Salkeld 
pitch for pitch. Greg's value just went up for next week's draft." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell (13-1) has signed with the University of Nevada-Reno on a football 
scholarship, but said the odds are 50-50 whether he will be catching footballs 
in college next season as a tight end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting excited about the (amateur baseball) draft," he said. "It feels 
good to beat someone with the reputation like Salkeld, but I didn't really beat 
him; our team beat their team." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it took four excellent defensive plays by Kennedy to hold Saugus 
scoreless. Reserve left fielder Todd Murakami made the most significant play of 
the game, reaching over the box-seat railing in left field to catch a foul ball 
by Saugus' Scott Warr in the seventh inning with two runners on and nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unbelievable catch," Pascal said. "The play of the game. He makes 
that play and then we get a double play to get out of the inning, otherwise the 
game's over and they win." 
</P>
<P>
Murakami's catch was so dazzling, it appeared to stun the Saugus baserunners, 
who failed to tag up on the play. Afterward, Saugus Coach Doug Worley said he 
sensed the game was lost when his runners froze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're screaming bloody murder when our guys didn't tag," Worley said. "When 
that kind of stuff happens, you start to get bad vibrations. I bet that was the 
first time they have made a play like that all season. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think things went very well for us. I don't want to think sour 
grapes, but if some of those balls we hit go an inch or two more the other way, 
we win the game, 1-0, in seven innings." 
</P>
<P>
The game of inches certainly didn't go Saugus' way in the decisive ninth 
inning. Hansell led off with a high chopper to third that Saugus third baseman 
Trevor Rice fielded cleanly but threw wildly to first and Hansell went to 
second on the error. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy catcher Scott Wood followed with a bunt between the mound and third 
base that Salkeld initially tried to field and then decided to watch as Rice 
couldn't make the play. Kennedy had runners at first and third with nobody out 
and Salkeld appeared to be unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran, a .190 hitter who had gone zero for three in the game, came to the 
plate with the Kennedy fans on their feet. Salkeld, visibly tiring and 
struggling to keep his control, threw a fastball outside that Saugus catcher 
J.B. Johnson never got a glove on and Hansell scored easily to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a straight fastball," Salkeld said. "I just had a bad release point on 
it. It was just a breakdown in my mechanics. That was the longest I've ever 
pitched." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell, who opened the game with six consecutive strikeouts, wasn't sure how 
much longer he could have gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if we didn't score in the ninth, I was going to have to go back out 
there and pitch," Hansell said. "I wanted to end it." 
</P>
<P>
By scoring on the wild pitch, Hansell ended the game and emerged as king of the 
hill.
