SAN DIEGO LEGISLATORS WIN PRIMARIES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surviving the sternest tests of their political careers, a handful of San Diego 
County legislators -- several of them mired in ethics-related controversies -- 
were overcoming strong primary challenges Tuesday to earn the right to defend 
their seats this fall. 
</P>
<P>
In the most competitive, contentious primary in recent San Diego political 
history, Democratic Rep. Jim Bates and two Assembly members -- Democrat Peter 
Chacon and Republican Sunny Mojonnier -- were winning their respective 
nominations, turning back the most serious challenges that they have faced in 
incumbencies stretching from 7 1/2 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In another closely watched race, one-time City Hall aide Jeff Marston was 
headed towards victory over former Democratic San Diego City Councilman Mike 
Gotch in the special 78th District contest to fill the vacancy created by 
Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate last December. Both also 
won their respective "normal" primaries, meaning that Gotch, who also finished 
behind Marston in April's special primary, will have an opportunity to reverse 
the outcome this fall when they compete for the two-year term at stake in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Assembly members -- Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) and Steve Peace (D-Chula 
Vista) -- won their contested primaries over opponents who, if nothing else, 
converted those normally somnolent races into much more than mere electoral 
formalities. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators' sweep demonstrated anew the considerable advantages of 
incumbency, for several of their victories came amid the kind of debilitating 
controversies that often end political careers. Bates, Chacon and Mojonnier, 
for example, each have faced official investigations into their conduct during 
their past term, while the incumbents' positions on volatile issues such as 
abortion and the death penalty also acted as a magnet for opposition in those 
and other contests. 
</P>
<P>
Bates' victory over lawyer Byron Georgiou marked the second consecutive 
campaign in which sexual harassment charges involving the congressman have been 
the issue, as the script and battle lines in Tuesday's primary largely 
duplicated those of his 1988 race. Bates' opponent this fall will be Republican 
Randall (Duke) Cunningham, a former Navy fighter pilot who outpolled government 
consultant Jim Lantry, former U.S. ambassador to Qatar Joseph Ghougassian and 
two long shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a guy that got hit with the kitchen sink but withstood it," Bates 
said. "I think my good record over 19 years made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, meanwhile, defeated former San Diego City Councilwoman Celia 
Ballesteros and newspaper editor John Warren, while Mojonnier handily 
outdistanced three rivals, led by former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
Despite warm, sunny weather Tuesday, the voter turnout was estimated at 34%, a 
dismal performance that some attributed to the paucity of major contested 
statewide contests. Even an unusually large number of competitive primaries 
here failed to generate higher interest among local voters. 
</P>
<P>
In a county where partisan campaigns often are races more in name than in fact, 
Tuesday's election was a compelling departure from the norm, as five San Diego 
legislators -- four state Assembly members and one congressman -- faced serious 
opposition in their party primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a key factor that makes so many incumbents virtually unassailable 
in general elections -- their party's lopsided voter registration edge within 
their district -- exposes them to greater vulnerability in primaries. 
Challengers from within their own party, while still having to overcome the 
incumbents' daunting name-recognition and fund-raising advantages, at least do 
not have those problems exacerbated by the demographic hurdle that confronts 
opponents from the opposite party. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Bates, Chacon and Mojonnier were viewed as the incumbents whose 
seats were most at risk, largely because each has been buffeted by serious 
ethical charges that compounded existing questions about their overall 
effectiveness. Hunter and Peace, meanwhile, also were forced to mount unusually 
aggressive campaigns against, respectively, anti-abortion activist Connie 
Youngkin in the 76th District and lawyers Darrel Vandeveld and Robert Garcia in 
the 80th District. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Bates' rebuke last October by the House Ethics Committee, it 
came as no surprise that the four-term San Diego Democrat drew strong 
opposition in his reelection campaign. What was unanticipated, however, was 
that, before Bates would have to face any of the five Republicans lining up for 
the chance to oppose him in November in the 44th District, he would have to 
turn back a challenge from a fellow Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Running on the slogan "The Democrat We Can Respect," Georgiou, the former legal 
affairs adviser to then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., sought to transform the 
primary into a referendum on Bates' morality. Bates' reprimand for sexually 
harassing two female aides and for improperly using his congressional staff for 
political purposes, Georgiou argued, not only diminished his effectiveness, but 
also left him vulnerable to a Republican challenge this fall. The entry of five 
Republicans -- Cunningham, Ghougassian, Lantry, Eric Epifano and Kenny Harrell 
-- into the GOP primary in a district with a 54%-34% Democratic voter 
registration edge bolstered his argument, Georgiou said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bates repeatedly apologized for the behavior that led to the 
reprimand, he also sought to downplay the controversy, attributing it to "some 
kidding and flirting around . . . blown out of proportion" by his opponents. 
Trumpeting his strong record on the environment and other core Democratic 
issues, Bates also encouraged voters to "not let one thing wipe out" his 
19-year career as a San Diego city councilman, county supervisor and 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Two other issues that kept Bates on the defensive were his vote for a hefty 
congressional pay raise and his opposition to the death penalty in most cases, 
a contrast to Georgiou's strong advocacy of capital punishment. Although Bates 
struck back by labeling Georgiou a carpetbagger for moving into the district 
early this year after dropping out of the special 78th Assembly District 
contest, the congressman conceded: "This race comes down to an up or down vote 
on me." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon faced a similar situation in the 79th Assembly District, where 
Ballesteros' candidacy, combined with his own liabilities, confronted him with 
the most serious challenge in his 10-term career. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of his closest supporters conceded that Chacon entered the primary 
with an unusually heavy load of political baggage. A recent California Journal 
article ranked him next-to-last in overall effectiveness in the Assembly, and 
Chacon, who occasionally has hinted that he was contemplating retirement, has 
drawn increasing criticism for spending far less time in San Diego than at his 
home in Placerville, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy spawned by Chacon's acceptance of $7,500 from a check cashers' 
organization in 1988 after he abandoned legislation opposed by the group also 
figured prominently in the campaign. The state attorney general's office 
concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge Chacon with a bribe, 
but Ballesteros charged that the gift placed him in murky ethical waters. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Chacon keeps saying he's going to retire," said one Ballesteros mailer 
that aptly summarized her campaign theme. "It's time the public took him up on 
his offer." 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier's campaign for a fifth two-year term in the 75th District was fought 
on similar turf, as she encountered the political fallout from a series of 
embarrassing headlines chronicling her recent tenure in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Mojonnier agreed to pay a $13,200 fine for double-billing the 
state and her campaign committee for business trips, as well as for using 
political donations to pay for fashion and beauty treatments for her staff. 
Along with other state legislators, she also has been criticized for routinely 
using state-paid sergeants-at-arms for personal tasks, such as chauffeuring her 
children and escorting her home after evening parties. Her opponents also 
resurrected an issue from Mojonnier's last campaign -- her 1987 acceptance of a 
$10,000 speaking fee from the California Peace Officers Assn. after leaving her 
sickbed to vote for a new Los Angeles prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier benefited, however, from the splintering of the anti-incumbent vote 
by Delaney and the two other challengers -- La Jolla businesswoman Fay McGrath 
and Poway school board member Stan Rodkin. 
</P>
<P>
The special 78th District race between Gotch and Marston, meanwhile, was 
perhaps more notable for its unorthodox, confusing format than for its content. 
With Gotch's experience in elective office providing the major distinction 
between the two candidates, most attention focused on the peculiarity of their 
"double election" -- the runoff in the special race for the remaining six 
months in Killea's unexpired term, and their normal primary for the two-year 
term at stake this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Billing himself as the "only tried and tested" candidate in the race, Gotch 
argued that his eight years' service on the City Council made him 
better-equipped to quickly adapt to the Legislature. But Marston, a one-time 
aide to former Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.), 
characterized his own staff work as "doing everything but pushing the button" 
on a wide range of local and statewide issues.

ELECTIONS 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
GALLEGLY LEADS KORMAN IN GOP PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) was easily winning renomination in the GOP 
primary election Tuesday, and appeared to be trouncing wealthy Calabasas 
developer Sang Korman for the second time in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
In early returns, Gallegly was leading Korman by a 3-1 margin, despite the 
Korean-born challenger's unusual use of television ads attacking Gallegly's 
voting record and Gallegly's disputed role in an internal FBI investigation of 
four Los Angeles-based agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tremendous confidence in the voters of this district," the congressman 
said. "Most of them can separate fact from fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly beat Korman soundly in the 21st Congressional District primary in 
1988, when the former Simi Valley mayor racked up 55,721 votes to Korman's 
9,467. 
</P>
<P>
Korman, 52, financed both races largely out of his own pocket, lending his 1988 
campaign $245,000 and this year's campaign at least $200,000. Although he 
arrived in the United States in 1972 with virtually no money, he said he is now 
worth about $800,000, mostly as a result of real estate transactions in Los 
Angeles' Koreatown district. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Gallegly adopted a strategy of ignoring Korman as much as 
possible, refusing to debate him or to respond much to his frequent press 
release attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly now faces Democrat Richard Freiman, an Agoura lawyer, in the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
But Gallegly, 46, is likely to win his third term in November in the district, 
where Republicans outnumber Democrats 177,000 to 124,000. The district covers 
the western and northern portions of Los Angeles County and southern and 
central Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will challenge Gallegly a third time in 1992, Korman said: "Two 
years from now, how do I know?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite sharing Gallegly's basic conservatism on many issues, Korman hammered 
the incumbent with a $120,000 series of commercials on local network and cable 
television outlets -- an unusual and expensive tactic in such a geographically 
far-flung congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
In one ad, Korman attacked Gallegly for his involvement in the internal FBI 
inquiry in 1987 and 1988. The agents were the target of a yearlong probe after 
they lobbied Gallegly in 1987 to support a then-pending bill to raise their 
overtime pay rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he did not file the complaints against the agents that prompted 
the inquiry. But documents released by the FBI show that he repeatedly 
complained to high-ranking bureau officials that the agents threatened him and 
conspired to defeat him in his 1988 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Korman's ads claimed that Gallegly covered up his role in the investigation, 
which eventually cleared the agents of any wrongdoing.

ELECTIONS SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHAEFER LEADS; HOWARD, DAVIS IN RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Madge L. Schaefer held an early lead in her bid for a second term on the county 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday while early returns showed two Simi Valley City 
Council members emerging from a crowded field in the 4th supervisorial district 
to qualify for the general election in November. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, 48, deflected the aggressive challenge of Maria VanderKolk, a 
25-year-old political newcomer who ran on a slow-growth theme but whose 
experience compared poorly to Schaefer's 20 years on city and county boards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely delighted," the 2nd District supervisor said after early 
returns showed her with 55% of the vote. "I think that the individual who is 
aware made a clear choice." 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, euphoric in apparent defeat, said her strength against a respected 
incumbent demonstrates voters' depth of concern about preserving open space in 
the 2nd District, which stretches from Thousand Oaks to Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've sent a real strong message that there is a wellspring of concern 
for the environment out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Early balloting showed Simi Valley Councilwoman Vicky Howard leading council 
colleague and next-door neighbor Bill Davis in a five-candidate race to see who 
will replace retiring incumbent James R. Dougherty on the powerful county 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who has been active in local politics for two decades, lured Davis into 
politics 10 years ago and now faces a five-month campaign where her task will 
be to emphasize her strengths and his weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping we would take it in the primary," Howard said while attending a 
crowded party at a friend's home in Simi Valley. "To campaign until November 
will be a very big strain on everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a runoff, Davis said, "I think you'll see a lot more action" as 
the summer wears on. He said he expects to spend about $100,000, twice as much 
as he raised for the primary. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Davis had said, "I can guarantee you it's going to get a lot hotter 
and heavier in the next few months. Whether I'll stay a real nice guy, we'll 
see." 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis emerged early as front-runners in the 4th District, which 
includes Simi Valley and Moorpark. They said they felt all along that it would 
be close and be between them. 
</P>
<P>
Growth was a central issue in both supervisorial races and promises to be 
revisited in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County boasts of its restrictions that cluster new construction in or 
near cities. But with two massive housing projects at the Jordan and Ahmanson 
ranches pending, a possible swing vote on the five-member board was at stake on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the adjacent developments would bring about 11,000 new residents and 
240 acres of commercial, office and retail space into the rolling hills east of 
Thousand Oaks at the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
Both Davis and Howard, as members of the Simi Valley council, indicated their 
support for a complex land deal that would make possible the construction of 
750 houses and a golf course at entertainer Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2nd District, the Jordan Ranch issue was embraced as the central theme 
of VanderKolk, who was recruited by the environmental group Save Open Space. 
The group draws most of its members from the Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, who entered the race in March on the last day of filing, blasted 
Schaefer as pro-development and maintained that by accepting tens of thousands 
of dollars from development interests the incumbent was beholden to them. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who rode a controlled growth platform onto the Thousand Oaks City 
Council in 1978, characterized herself as moderate on the growth issue and 
emphasized that she is a conservative Republican. VanderKolk described herself 
as a "left-wing Republican." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia Inc., a clothing company that successfully backed three slow-growth 
candidates in last fall's Ventura City Council election, boosted the VanderKolk 
campaign in mid-May with its endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
But Patagonia's pledge to buy $9,000 worth of newspaper advertisements 
endorsing VanderKolk and Glen Schmidt in the 4th District was withdrawn after 
Schaefer asked the district attorney to investigate whether the ads would 
violate a state law that generally restricts individual and corporate 
contributions to $1,000 a year per candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging her likely defeat on Monday, VanderKolk said she considered her 
campaign a success. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were complete long shots from the beginning," she said. "Our main 
hope was to send a strong enough message that there is great concern out there 
about development -- to send that message to the Board of Supervisors. If 
nothing else, we've managed to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, a college-educated housewife, waged her campaign as a sure thing, 
spending only about half of the $40,000 in her campaign treasury. 
</P>
<P>
She spent most of the final week before the election in New York City, 
representing the county in meetings with Wall Street firms that rate county 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said her strategy of a low-cost, low-key campaign did not vary from 
start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
She distributed two mailers, one reprinting a Ventura newspaper's flattering 
editorial endorsement and a second stressing her conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I presume that people in this district, where we have a very high median 
education level, are informed . . . that they make up their minds over four 
years," she said. "If I thought they made up their minds over what they hear in 
the last two months, I could have taken the first 3 1/2 years off." 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis share similar political backgrounds, both having served on 
neighborhood councils and the Planning Commission before becoming City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
During their time on the council, both candidates have proved to be strong, 
popular leaders. Their popularity was underscored by the number of endorsements 
each received this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 62, was supported by the Ventura County Firefighters Assn., the Ventura 
County Public Employees Assn. and the Ventura County Economic Assn. Howard, 55, 
was backed by Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury and the county Deputy Sheriffs Assn.

OXNARD TAX BEHIND DURING EARLY BALLOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 5% utility users tax designed to solve Oxnard's financial crisis by 
generating $5 million annually seemed headed for defeat in early election 
returns Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, a ballot measure that amends the city's slow growth limits 
seemed destined for approval. And in Santa Paula, a bond measure designed to 
raise funds to renovate the city's only public high school appeared on its way 
to approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council had placed Measure C on the ballot in hopes it would 
generate revenue to wipe away a projected $2.8-million deficit next year and 
help the city fatten its reserves, which have been drained in the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had warned that without the revenue from the measure the city 
would be forced to make drastic cuts in services and personnel, possibly 
including police and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has been at the center of the most expensive ballot measure 
campaign in Oxnard's history -- generating nearly $40,000 in support. It also 
has been one of the most controversial, sparking accusations of deception and 
charges that developers are bankrolling the measure and have attempted to bribe 
a city councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, including the city's police and firefighter associations, said in 
campaign statements that defeat of the measure could lead to drastic layoffs in 
the city's already understaffed police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a terrible thing for the city" if the measure is rejected, 
said Councilman Manuel Lopez, who said he was surprised by early returns. "We 
are faced with such a revenue shortfall that we will be hard-pressed to 
implement all the things we will have to do in order to balance the budget." 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, including the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and a group of 
residents and business owners who call themselves Oxnard Residents for 
Responsible Government, have blamed the city's financial woes on government 
mismanagement. They urged residents to reject the tax increase and put a stop 
to the city government's "free-spending attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said developers donated a lion's share of the contributions to 
Citizens for Public Safety, a pro-tax group, only to win favor with the 
council, an accusation that developers denied. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Councilwoman Ann Johs accused one developer of offering to employ a 
Westwood public relations firm to assist in approving the tax in exchange for 
her support of a controversial building project. The developer, Warmington 
Homes of Orange County, denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
Marc L. Charney, an Oxnard attorney and vocal opponent of the measure, said he 
believes voters were reluctant to give the city a new source of revenue given 
its history of financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
When voters are asked to pass a tax increase, "it's always an uphill battle but 
that's not the whole picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Davison, treasurer for Oxnard Residents for Responsible Government, said 
many voters in Oxnard opposed the tax increase because they feel their voice is 
not heard in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, to have taken effect July 1, would have been added to telephone, 
cable, electric, gas and garbage-collection fees and would have cost the 
average household about $4 a month. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, a divided Oxnard City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to 
approve a deadline extension for a Washington-based firm hired to draft a 
management audit designed to uncover the cause of the city's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Cresap Management Consultants wrote a letter to the city dated May 30 saying it 
could not meet the May 31 deadline for completing the audit. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had repeatedly said the results of the audit would be released 
before voters go to the polls to decide the utility tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwomen Dorothy Maron, Geraldine (Gerry) Furr and Johs voted to give 
Cresap until June 19 to complete the audit. Mayor Nao Takasugi and Lopez 
opposed the deadline extension. 
</P>
<P>
The three councilwomen said they supported the extension because they believe 
that the city is partly to blame for the audit's delay. They said Cresap was 
forced to do additional work on the audit because council members asked Cresap 
to meet with each member to discuss their concerns about the city's financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi and Lopez urged that the council cancel its contract with Cresap for 
missing the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Takasugi both said it was vital that voters know the cause of the 
city's financial crisis before they decide to approve another revenue source 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said that Cresap never warned the city that the additional meetings 
with council members would delay the completion of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
In early returns, Simi Valley voters were approving a ballot measure that 
amends the city's controlled growth ordinance by giving priority to developers 
planning to build affordable housing for low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Measure B amends a 1986 ordinance that allows about 43 building permits to be 
issued every three months until it expires in mid-1996. Under the amendment, 
developers building low-income senior citizens housing units are allowed to 
exceed the permit limit by borrowing from future permit allocations. 
</P>
<P>
But there was virtually no opposition to the measure and no ballot argument was 
submitted against Measure B. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Santa Paula, according to early returns, were approving Measure A, a 
bond initiative that provides the city's only public high school $5 million to 
renovate the cracking, peeling historic landmark. The measure requires support 
of two-thirds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bond measure say Santa Paula High School, with buildings that 
date back to the 1930s, is a stately but decaying structure that badly needs 
attention. 
</P>

The measure requires homeowners to pay $30 per $100,000 in assessed valuation 
over the next 25 years to finance repairs to the high school. There was 
virtually no opposition to the measure.

SUDDEN CELEBRITY PUZZLES FREEWAY ORDEAL SURVIVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
In the two weeks since the tale of his gritty four-day vigil along a freeway 
median drew national attention, hit-and-run survivor Juan Francisco Camacho 
remains bewildered over the outpouring of public sympathy in cards, letters, 
checks and offers of employment, from Alaska to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The wall above his hospital bed -- where the 20-year-old Mexican migrant worker 
will remain in traction for months to come -- is filled with notes and 
hand-drawn pictures from well-wishers, including a letter from former President 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, nurses bring new stacks of mail to add to the more than 100 letters 
and packages he has received -- including collective notes from preschool 
classes in Arizona and Northern California, as well as an offer from a local 
man to fly Camacho's mother to San Diego from his hometown in southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla has even begun a trust fund in Camacho's 
name to handle the many checks and money orders still pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
But Camacho, a shy man who speaks no English but still finds a way to flirt 
with the nurses on his floor, has grown weary of the constant press intrusion. 
Last week, as a photographer from a Florida-based tabloid positioned Camacho's 
arms and head, the usually easygoing man finally placed his hands over his face 
as if to say, "The photo session is over," nurses said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a "No Visitors" sign hangs on the door of his room. Lack of privacy is one 
of the prices Camacho has paid for his new-found and unsolicited fame. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, he was getting bothered all the time by reporters and television 
cameras, wanting pictures of his wounds and all the emotional insights of what 
he went through," said Adelaida Bernas, a nurse who supervises Camacho's care. 
</P>
<P>
"He's embarrassed the way they're exposing his medical problems. He doesn't 
speak English, so the only way he can deal with it is cover his face with his 
hands or a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Said another nurse: "A lot of reporters are like little gnats, they're so 
pushy. But he wasn't going to be intimidated -- especially by a woman 
photographer." 
</P>
<P>
Camacho entered the national spotlight last month after he lay near death in 
the brushy median of Interstate 5 in Oceanside for four days, as hundreds of 
thousands of motorists passed by without noticing him. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his 92-hour saga -- in which the delirious Camacho drank water 
from a roadside sprinkler and several times thought he heard the telephone 
wires overhead answering his calls -- he was spotted by a motorist after 
crawling from the cover of thick oleander bushes and back onto the road 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho, who suffered a shattered pelvis, broken arm and shoulder and internal 
injuries, was trying to cross the busy freeway shortly before dusk one Saturday 
when he was apparently struck from behind by a hit-and-run driver. When he was 
rescued by paramedics the following Wednesday afternoon, his body was wracked 
with infection. (His hospital bills -- estimated by doctors to be in the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars -- are being paid by Scripps.) 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a month after his ordeal, Camacho still cannot understand why so many 
Americans have become fascinated with his gutsy efforts to stay alive. Those 
who have come to know him say that, as an undocumented laborer living at a 
rural, makeshift campsite since his arrival in the United States four years 
ago, Camacho's everyday existence has been a tale of determined survival. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, however, he's become an object of attention for reporters from more 
than a dozen newspapers, magazines and TV stations -- all of whom want to tell 
the painful details of a struggle that played itself out within an arm's reach 
of one of the world's busiest freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"To him, he did nothing that he considered heroic," said Terri Marquez, a 
Spanish-speaking nurse's aide who has interpreted interviews for Camacho and 
still visits him regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"The life he has led in the migrant camps the past few years has taught him how 
to be a survivor, how to find water, go without food. So surviving is nothing 
new to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He just doesn't understand why he's become such a celebrity. It's not just a 
language barrier, it's a cultural barrier as well." 
</P>
<P>
Although his infections and resulting fever have blurred Camacho's memory of 
the details of his ordeal, he has nonetheless struggled -- time and again -- to 
answer reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that so many people want the details of what was going on in his 
mind during those long days and nights," Marquez said. "But he's frustrated. He 
says, 'How can I tell them how I felt if I'm not sure of the words myself?' " 
</P>
<P>
Along with the intrusion, there is a positive side to all the attention, 
Camacho acknowledges: the cheery get-well cards and letters that just keep 
coming, from Maine, Nevada, Missouri and British Columbia -- places Camacho had 
never even heard of. 
</P>
<P>
They come written in both Spanish and English. Some have religious overtones, 
others include checks and a word of good luck. Children have written endearing 
letters full of pictures of stick men meant to represent Camacho lying by the 
roadside. Still other letters offer jobs and sundry rays of hope: 
</P>
<P>
"Please come to Alaska, go to adult school and get a good job," one letter 
reads. "Employers in Alaska want courageous people like you." 
</P>
<P>
Another letter responded to earlier reports that Camacho had yet to tell his 
sickly mother back home in Oaxaca of his ordeal: "Call your mother," the male 
writer advised. "Even though she's sick, she still worries and cares about you. 
I mean, if I care about you, imagine how she feels." 
</P>
<P>
The letter Camacho most cherishes came from Reagan, who drew from his own 
mishaps to offer a note of hope: "This is a difficult time for you; however, 
from personal experience, we have found that your burden can become lighter if 
you trust in the Lord and in those who care about you." 
</P>
<P>
The letters, Camacho says, are bright spots that balance out the nightmares he 
still has about the incident. He plans to answer each of them in person.

from Ronald Reagan) have lifted his spirits.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL TRIES TO BLOCK TRAILER PARK 
RAZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel Tuesday voted to help prevent the new owner of 
a 27-unit Van Nuys trailer park from razing the park and replacing it with a 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted unanimously to support a 
plan proposed by Councilman Joel Wachs to rezone the Woodley Trailer Park for 
multifamily residential use to protect the park's low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The property at 7936 Woodley Ave. is zoned for light-industrial use, and 
Yechezchel Lehavi, who bought the site in 1989, says he intends to develop it 
for commercial or industrial use. The one-acre parcel, the site of a mobile 
home park since 1948, is surrounded by industrial properties. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs' proposal still needs full council approval.

COUNTY ADOPTS PLAN TO CUT THE COST OF LEGAL DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to cut legal 
expenses by creating a new county legal department and expanding the duties of 
the Public Defender's Office. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous action creates a county office to handle criminal court cases in 
which the public defender has a conflict of interest. It also significantly 
expands the number of public defender deputies handling juvenile court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the county pays hourly fees to about 350 area lawyers 
in private practice through the Department of Alternate Defense Counsel, 
commonly known as the "conflicts office." Most of those cases involve multiple 
defendants or, in juvenile court, any number of a child's relatives. By 
replacing private attorneys with salaried county lawyers, county budget 
planners project an annual cost savings of $7 million beginning in fiscal year 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution requires that poor defendants in criminal cases and some 
persons involved in juvenile court cases be provided with free counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The county will immediately begin seeking lawyers for the new legal office in 
anticipation of taking over some cases as early as September and all cases by 
December, the county staff said. 
</P>
<P>
The department was created over the opposition of private lawyers who stand to 
lose a large source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's vote, several attorneys, including representatives of the 
county Juvenile Justice Bar Assn. and Women's Criminal Defense Bar Assn., 
criticized the plan for the new department as flawed and based on inaccurate 
projections of court caseloads and legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the soaring fees paid to private lawyers that prompted the 
county to act. 
</P>
<P>
County planners had projected that fees paid to attorneys in 
conflict-of-interest cases would be $2.3 million for fiscal 1990. It is now 
projected that cost will be $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 609% increase is due, in part, to the rise in drug-related cases and the 
difficulty in predicting caseloads in a given year.

To honor the Southern California lifestyle, the city of Manhattan Beach bolted 
a sculpture of dumbbells to a seaside bench last year. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, thieves keep lifting them -- most recently the other night. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't a case of them being knocked off by mistake," said Howard Spector, 
the city's public arts administrator. "Not only were they bolted to the bench, 
they were epoxied, too." 
</P>
<P>
The 25-pound cast-bronze dumbbells were snatched from the same bench last 
September. They were returned that time after a local group, the Friends of the 
Arts, offered a $500 reward, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
In case the same thieves were thinking of making the sculpture a regular source 
of income, the Friends are offering no reward this time. 
</P>
<P>
The weights, titled (and spelled) "Ddumbbells" by creator Ann Preston of Santa 
Monica, cost the city $7,000, which is one reason some citizens have criticized 
Manhattan Beach's public arts program as ddumb. 
</P>
<P>
If race car drivers competing against Tim Capaldi are extra careful about 
careening into him, you can't blame them. Capaldi's dragster bears the logo of 
his sponsor, Legal Rights Defenders, a local lawyer's group. 
</P>
<P>
Election Day has evolved into something a bit more stately -- and even more 
honest -- than it was in 1850s L.A. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there was no list of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Harris Newmark recalled how various candidates would round up newly 
arrived workers "like so many cattle, confine them in corrals (usually in Boyle 
Heights), keep them in a truly magnificent state of intoxication until the 
eventful morning" and then cart them off to the city's only polling place in 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who wanted to cast two (or more) ballots, Newmark added, were not 
above voting once and then "cutting off the hair, shaving (the) beard or 
mustache, re-clothing or otherwise transforming (their) appearance." 
</P>
<P>
At least, there were fewer complaints of voter apathy. 
</P>
<P>
This being Southern California, it was inevitable that our proposed "Malathion 
Song Book" would attract various ethnic entries. Our favorites so far are 
Miguel Novelo Jr.'s "Medfly Nortena" ("Medfly of the North"), which he points 
out "would go perfect with ranchera music," and Ed Bissot's "Club Medfly," an 
original composition with a Caribbean beat and these lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 Come to the Club Medfly, 
</P>
<P>
 Where malathion fills the sky.

MONORAIL PROPOSAL LEADS 2 OTHER PLANS IN FIRST RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed futuristic monorail line along the Ventura Freeway across the San 
Fernando Valley was proving by far the most popular of three rail plans in an 
advisory referendum Tuesday, with about a third of the vote counted. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the vote could bolster the thus-far largely unsuccessful drive to 
build support for a monorail system linking the East and West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Running second, with about half as many votes as the monorail plan, was a 
proposed light-rail line in a shallow trench along the Southern Pacific 
railroad's Burbank Branch right of way from North Hollywood to Warner Center -- 
a plan that consistently has drawn the wrath of homeowners living along the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
In third place was the plan approved two months ago by the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail 
subway westward from North Hollywood to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail extension, which also would utilize the railroad's Burbank 
Branch right of way, has the support of elected officials, business leaders and 
homeowner group leaders. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth option on the ballot -- no rail line at all -- was drawing substantial 
support, leading all alternatives but the monorail plan. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum, the first time that voters have had a say in the seven-year 
debate over what kind of rail line, if any, to build in the Valley, was 
conducted in an area that includes the San Fernando Valley, Glendale, Agoura 
Hills, Calabasas and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
When they voted in March to endorse the Metro Rail extension and reject 
monorail and light rail, commissioners, who control all rail construction 
spending in the county, said they could not wait for the advisory vote to 
choose between the three plans. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A was placed on the ballot by county supervisors at the behest of 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who hoped that a strong vote for his slowly dying 
monorail plan would persuade the commission to substitute it for the Metro Rail 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years since he unveiled the monorail proposal, Antonovich has had 
difficulty drumming up support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Most officials say they are wary of introducing a third rail technology to the 
county -- in addition to the Metro Rail and ground-level light-rail systems 
under construction -- and that they still consider monorail to be experimental 
in this country, although several short lines operate in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the cross-Valley Metro Rail extension have become alarmed in 
recent weeks at the possibility that a surge in support for a monorail system 
could threaten years of coalition building on behalf of their plan. 
</P>
<P>
Until the warring parties came together on the Metro Rail plan, homeowner 
groups and business leaders had battled for years over what kind of rail system 
to build in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders insisted that the only affordable system that would relieve 
the Valley's traffic woes was a light-rail line in a shallow trench along the 
Southern Pacific railroad's Burbank Branch, from the planned Metro Rail 
northern terminus in North Hollywood to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner groups vehemently opposed that plan, saying above-ground trains would 
disturb residents of the single-family homes that line almost half the right of 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Business groups eventually abandoned their insistence that a line go all the 
way across the Valley, and agreed to back a line to the San Diego Freeway with 
the stipulation that travelers be able to transfer to express buses bound for 
the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Even as late as Monday, proponents of the Metro Rail extension and monorail 
dueled over the question of cost. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich has maintained in recent weeks that a review by his office indicates 
that a 16.5-mile elevated monorail line from Universal City to Canoga Park 
could be built for less than $1.1 billion -- or about $65 million per mile. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the estimate for the 5.6-mile Metro Rail extension from North 
Hollywood to Van Nuys is $1.1 billion, or about $195 million per mile. 
</P>
<P>
The third plan that was on Tuesday's ballot, the 14.1-mile light-rail line from 
North Hollywood to Warner Center, would cost $1 billion, or about $70 million a 
mile, according to Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission staff, in a letter 
released late Monday, contradicted Antonovich's claim. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, executive director of the commission, said that even though the 
commission has reduced its cost estimates for monorail by $200 million, the 
futuristic system would still cost $1.6 billion -- half a billion more than 
Antonovich has said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff has not completed its study of cost-reduction proposals 
for monorail, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Still under evaluation are Antonovich's proposals to eliminate from the 
commission design three subway segments, totaling 3 1/2 miles, at the freeway's 
most congested points -- between De Soto and Canoga avenues, at the 
intersection with the San Diego Freeway, and in Studio City.

DRIVER IS FACING 2 COUNTS OF MURDER IN STUDENTS' DEATHS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE PALMDALE MAN WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH EVADING ARREST AND ASSAULT WITH A 
DEADLY WEAPON AFTER A PACOIMA SHOOTING INCIDENT.

<P>
A Palmdale man was charged with murder Tuesday for allegedly killing two San 
Fernando Valley teen-agers last week in a car crash in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Vargas Servin was charged with two counts of murder and one count of 
evading an officer in connection with the accident Friday that killed Uriel 
Fernandez of Pacoima and Aracely Hernandez of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Servin allegedly was fleeing police when his pickup sped through a red light 
and slammed into a car carrying three high school students home from a pep 
rally at Sylmar High School. Police said Servin's truck had been traveling 55 
m.p.h. to 60 m.p.h. through the residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, 16, a junior at San Fernando High School, died at San Fernando 
Community Hospital. Hernandez, 18, a cheerleader at Sylmar High School, died at 
the scene. A second passenger in Fernandez's car, Juan Melendrez, 16, suffered 
cuts and bruises, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Servin also was charged with one count of assault with a firearm stemming from 
a shooting incident a few blocks from the crash site. The shooting prompted the 
police chase, said Deputy Dist. Atty. James A. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Servin, who turned 22 on Tuesday, pleaded not guilty before Van Nuys Municipal 
Court Commissioner Richard Margolin. Margolin set bail at $500,000 and 
scheduled a preliminary hearing for June 14. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police, who investigated the accident and shooting that preceded 
it, earlier said the was shooting gang-related. But several friends of Servin 
on Tuesday emphatically denied that he was a gang member and police on Tuesday 
also backed away from that label. 
</P>
<P>
Servin is not in the Police Department's gang files, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It all smacks of gang activity," Detective Don Bellante said. "But we can't 
substantiate that at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said several young men were standing outside a house on 
Louvre Street in Pacoima a few blocks from the accident scene when two vehicles 
-- one of which was Servin's pickup -- drove by. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe a gang name was called from one of the vehicles and 
that Servin got out of his truck and confronted one of the men. A fistfight 
began and Servin allegedly went to his pickup, got a handgun and threatened the 
men. Police said he apparently fired several shots in the air, which were heard 
by a San Fernando police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
With lights flashing but with the siren off, the sergeant chased Servin's 
pickup west on Chatsworth Avenue at speeds up to 60 m.p.h. before Servin ran a 
red light at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and collided with Fernandez's southbound 
car about 9:10 p.m., Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Servin was captured as he attempted to run from the scene. 
</P>
<P>

37TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;

<P>
WRIGHT OUT FRONT IN BID FOR 6TH TERM 
</P>

Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) appeared to be beating back her 
strongest primary challenger in 10 years Tuesday, fending off opponent Hunt 
Braly's charges that she misused her office by trying to fix her daughter's 
traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 61, was outpolling Braly in early returns by a 3-2 margin. Braly, 35, 
is the top aide to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), a longtime political 
antagonist of Wright. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to see that my record in the past 10 years has been accepted 
by the people and that they still want me," said Wright, speaking from a 
crowded suite at a Simi Valley hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter's driving record is her driver record and she has paid dearly for 
it. The voters accepted it as her problem and they accepted that I tried to 
help her as a mother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and Braly spent more than $400,000 on the 37th Assembly District race, 
making it the most expensive and bitter primary struggle in the San Fernando 
Valley region. Their campaign was also one of the few hotly contested Assembly 
primaries in the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
Wright now faces Democrat Dennis Petrie, a program director at a Chatsworth 
home for juvenile delinquents, in the November general election. But she is 
heavily favored to win a sixth term in the district, where Republicans hold a 
registration edge over Democrats of nearly 53% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
A staunch conservative and abortion foe, Wright became politically vulnerable 
when Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury concluded, following a 
10-week investigation last year, that she engaged in "a clear pattern" of 
trying to obtain leniency from law enforcement officials for her daughter, 
Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright faced jail or loss of her license after accumulating 28 traffic 
tickets -- 24 of them for speeding -- during a seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bradbury said the assemblywoman intervened repeatedly with local 
police, judges and state Department of Motor Vehicles officials on her 
daughter's behalf, he found that she committed no prosecutable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Braly hammered at Wright in speeches and direct-mail brochures to voters, 
claiming that her actions were unethical and constituted an abuse of her 
official position. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said she was only trying to help her daughter and that voters would 
agree she did nothing improper. In her own mailer, she attacked Braly for 
trying to exploit "a sad family tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Braly, noting the difficulty of unseating an incumbent, took comfort in the 
relatively large proportion of voters he won to his side. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can poll 40% against her on her home turf, I think it says something 
about the lack of accomplishments she's had over the past couple of years," he 
said, surrounded by supporters at a Newhall restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"It means she's got to do a better job representing the district, which is what 
we've been saying all along." 
</P>
<P>
Wright was clearly concerned about the potential impact of the charges, and she 
hired a high-priced Sacramento political consulting firm, Huckaby-Rodriguez 
Inc., that specializes in conservative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
She also campaigned vigorously in her far-flung district, which stretches from 
the northwestern suburbs of Los Angeles County into portions of Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Braly stumbled during the campaign by claiming an endorsement from 
a pro-choice group that does not make political endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Braly quickly apologized for the incident, but Wright capitalized on it, saying 
in a mailer that the move was a political dirty trick that cast doubt on 
Braly's own ethics.

WATER AUTHORITY, SDG&amp;E HOLD TALKS ON DESALINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of San Diego County's water and power agencies huddled Tuesday to 
explore the possibility of turning ocean water into drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
After the session, Byron Buck, County Water Authority planning director, said 
the consensus was "very positive, that there is a definite possibility of a 
joint venture" to explore the feasibility of a combination desalination and 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Williams, generation projects manager for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., said the prospect of a joint desalination project and power plant, 
although "still in the talking stages," holds promise. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just there to listen to their (CWA officials') proposal," to build a 
desalting plant in conjunction with a proposed new SDG&amp;E power plant, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plant could produce from 20 million to 40 million gallons of water a day 
at a cost of from $700 to $900 an acre foot, Buck said. He estimated the cost 
of the desalination plant would be $250 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E is studying several sites for their proposed $400-million power 
generation plant, including two which could be adapted to a joint power and 
water desalting facility. Sites at Carlsbad, near the present Encina generating 
plant, and in South Bay near the present Chula Vista power plant, would provide 
saltwater supplies for the desalination operation. 
</P>
<P>
Buck said that the county water agency has looked at Metropolitan Water 
District studies on desalination, which were rejected as infeasible by the 
giant Southern California water agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Those studies were based on retrofitting old plants," Buck said, "and we are 
talking about a completely different thing, starting from the ground floor and 
designing a complementary system."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHAEFER PRESSES FOR MORE STATE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer's proposal that Ventura County notify the state 
that it will cease to provide some essential services unless the state provides 
money for them drew a mixed response from the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer wants the county to send its proposed 1990-91 budget to Gov. George 
Deukmejian and the Legislature carrying a stamp of "NSF-insufficient funds," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to send a strong message that we just are not going to carry out these 
programs," Schaefer said, referring to a variety of health, welfare, safety and 
criminal justice services that the state requires but for which it provides 
partial funding. 
</P>
<P>
In response, veteran Supervisor James R. Dougherty told the board that Orange 
County tried the same strategy several years ago, only to be directed by the 
courts to provide the services. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer's proposal languished Tuesday, as did a suggestion by Supervisor Susan 
K. Lacey that the board forward to both the Republican and Democratic 
candidates for governor a statement of their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to ask some very tough questions" of the candidates and force them to 
take a stand, Lacey said.

<P>
Bay Park Elementary School teachers were granted permission Tuesday to waive 
letter grades in social studies and science for two years while they plan an 
improved curriculum and seek better ways to judge a student's academic 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city schools trustees voted 4 to 0, with Kay Davis absent, to approve 
the plan, which gives the teachers time to design new tests that move away from 
measuring only rote information. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Jim Roache said he was impressed by the quality of the school's 
proposal in what he called "a controversial" area of assessment. "You've stuck 
your neck out," Roache said, adding that, "a few years ago, I would have said, 
'No way would I have voted for this.' "

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman, charged with laundering $300,000 in 
cash purported to be the proceeds of Colombian cocaine profits, is expected to 
take the stand today in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Though Silberman's attorneys plan to call various witnesses, Silberman is in 
line to testify today, his lead defense lawyer, James J. Brosnahan, said 
Tuesday after the first full day of the defense's case in the complex trial. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, a one-time top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., is 
charged with laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent had portrayed as 
the profits of Colombian drug lords. If convicted, he faces up to 75 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Before giving way Tuesday to defense attorneys, prosecutors spent the past two 
weeks presenting 26 witnesses and the details of the two deals at the heart of 
the case against Silberman. The first, in November, 1988, involved a swap of 
$100,000 for stock, and the second, in February, 1989, involved an exchange of 
$200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies are looking for the boyfriend of a woman who was fatally 
stabbed in her van early Tuesday morning at a Vista gas station. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Charles Scott, 49, is wanted for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Scott fits the description of the man in the van given by witnesses, according 
to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Marion George, 32, of Clairemont, was treated at Palomar Medical Center 
for multiple stab wounds before she died about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Sheriff's Department, a witness saw George's brown van pull 
into a gas station in the 900 block of Escondido Avenue. The witness said a man 
got out of the passenger side and walked away casually. George was slumped in 
the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Manny Castillo said George apparently was being stabbed while she was 
driving the van. 
</P>
<P>
Officials described Scott as white, 5-foot-10, and weighing 200 pounds. He was 
wearing a black jacket and a watch cap and might be driving a late-1950s pickup 
truck, with a light primer coat and black fenders, or a chopper-style 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the Sheriff's Department said.

COLLEGE FACULTY UNION SWITCH VOIDS PROPOSED 3-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faculty members at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster have voted to dump 
their current union in favor of a more militant group, voiding an already 
negotiated three-year contract proposal that would have included substantial 
pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
With the campus now on summer session, college officials said a new contract 
deal and related pay raises for the campus' 360 instructors probably could not 
be drawn up before fall. 
</P>
<P>
In results from the hotly contested election, which were tallied Tuesday, 
college teachers voted 141 to 123 to select the American Federation of Teachers 
as their new collective bargaining agent. The AFT will replace the California 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract negotiated by the CTA, the college's 103 full-time 
instructors would have gotten a 10% pay raise July 1, and at least 5% in both 
the second and third years of the contract. The college's 257 part-time 
instructors would have gotten a $2.50-an-hour raise to start, and an additional 
5% in the second and third years. 
</P>
<P>
Federation officials would not say whether they were unhappy with the wage 
provisions of the contract proposal. But they did say the faculty's decision to 
forgo the immediate pay raises showed the extent of its dissatisfaction with 
the CTA's performance. 
</P>
<P>
The AFT, which already represents office workers at the college, is expected to 
present a tougher set of faculty contract demands, including one for a 
grievance policy, something the college has resisted. 
</P>
<P>
College President Allan Kurki declined to comment on the effect of the union 
switch, except to say, "I am disappointed we've got to start negotiations over 
again now. It had taken months for us to get to this particular point."

TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why haven't city officials offered a portion of the Central City West 
Development Project (Part A, May 22) as a possible school site? With Los 
Angeles' need for new schools coupled with the controversy surrounding the 
23.5-acre Ambassador Hotel site, our city would surely make room in this 
355-acre area for at least one new school.

TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial has left me speechless, almost. Let me get this right. Because 
Trump has lots of attorneys on his payroll, the school board should surrender 
and start evicting low-income families so more low-rent housing can be 
destroyed for the high school. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Homes versus a school -- force a very tough choice," you said. Well, 
that is just what the Ambassador site avoids. It gives us a school and keeps 
the low-cost housing intact. 
</P>
<P>
Why do you blame the school board for what you predict to be protracted 
litigation? Why do you not call for Trump and his partners to accept the 
decision gracefully? They will still have over 6 acres of Wilshire property for 
development. So their profits will be tens of millions instead of hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Hey, we all have to make sacrifices.

<TEXT>
<P>
The priorities of The Times with regards to the Ambassador site seem to be 
development first, children, if a place can be found for them, second, and 
retention of low-cost housing last, if anything is left. Why not knock down an 
old office building if more offices are needed in the mid-Wilshire area? The 
Times would have the school board destroy people's homes as the way to solve 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Better to relocate a place of work than further aggravate the low-income 
housing stock. Better to place a new high school on land that tells children 
they are our top priority. 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador site is the place to make the hard decisions for our children's 
future. Los Angeles Times and Donald Trump, move on down the road. Our children 
need a new school as soon as possible.

INDEPENDENCE FOR KASHMIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jansen in his biased article seems to be trying to defend a client without 
fully grasping the details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that Kashmiris have a distinct identity, culture and tradition. 
Well, so do 17 other states of India and many of them have a different 
language, too. Jansen does not seem to know the history of India. India 
consists of many different cultures, customs, traditions and languages. India, 
in fact, possesses cultures and customs more diverse than the whole of Europe 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
No government no matter how democratic can allow its legitimate state to secede 
on the basis of these diversities. Throughout history Kashmir has always been a 
part of India whether Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
Jansen claims that the majority population of Kashmir is Muslim. Yes, but so 
what? India is a secular country and has an excellent record of toleration of 
all religions. 
</P>
<P>
Jansen then goes on to compare this illegal secessionist movement to the 
intifada in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. While the intifada is a freedom movement by 
Palestinians in their own land against the occupying forces of Israel, Kashmir 
terrorists are trying to form an independent state illegally out of an integral 
part of India. There simply is no comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Jansen makes an outrageous suggestion. He is asking America and the 
Soviet Union to intervene! Jansen seems to have forgotten that India is not the 
Middle East. No country in the world has a right to interfere in what is an 
internal affair of India. A forceful intervention will be disastrous for any 
country that attempts it. 
</P>
<P>
A plebiscite as suggested by Jansen is nothing more than wishful thinking. How 
can there be a plebiscite for an integral part of a sovereign nation?

WALTER JOHN REPHUN; DANCE TEACHER AND CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter John Rephun, an avid dancer and dance teacher who was also a longtime 
construction foreman, has died in his Lancaster home of cancer. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Rephun spent nearly 50 years working as a building inspector and construction 
foreman and helped build several schools and public buildings, including the 
Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Lancaster. He also was a real estate 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
But his real love was dancing, which he began teaching in the 1950s in San 
Diego, his widow, Neta Deeter Rephun, said. He won several trophies for various 
dancing styles, including folk and ballroom dancing, the rumba and the cha-cha. 
</P>
<P>
He died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after moving to Lancaster in 1956, Rephun opened Walt's "Time" Studio. 
Neta Rephun said the couple met in one of his classes and their relationship 
bloomed over a cup of tea one evening after class. The couple were married on 
Feb. 4, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Rephun closed the studio in 1964 when the construction business became too 
demanding, but he and his wife continued to dance weekly with the Triple S 
Ballroom Dance Club until two months before his death. He was a lifetime member 
of the Assn. of Dance Teachers of Southern California, which he joined in 1955, 
and was a member of the Dance Masters of America, which he joined in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
He was also a longtime member of the Lancaster Elks Lodge and the Lancaster 
Loyal Order of Moose. 
</P>
<P>
Born April 10, 1919, in San Francisco, Rephun served in the Navy from 1939 to 
1942, achieving the rank of chief petty officer. In addition to his wife, his 
survivors include: a son, Stephen J. Rephun of Bonita, Calif.; a sister, Bertha 
Jean Treahy of San Diego; and three nephews and one niece. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at the Antelope Valley 
Church of Religious Science. Private burial will be at Joshua Memorial Park in 
Lancaster.

TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lo and behold -- The Times' editorial ("The $64-Million Trump Question," May 
26) certainly gave old Donald Trump a big hefty boost. Just think of the 
prestige for Los Angeles if the tallest building in the world is built here. 
</P>
<P>
The needs of a few families, their modest homes, low-rent apartments and small 
businesses simply can't compare with the need for one of Donald's phallic 
edifices. 
</P>
<P>
Our youngsters deserve and need a new school. The Ambassador Hotel is the 
perfect site to build for the future of our beleaguered children, who are tired 
of riding long distances on buses to school every day. Marla Maples is not the 
only one to get into bed with Trump. Shame, shame, Los Angeles Times!

BIG LOSER IS KIM'S REPRESSIVE REGIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days ago a clearly stunned North Korean government expressed incredulity 
at the prospect of a meeting between the leaders of South Korea, its hated 
rival, and the Soviet Union, its most important international patron. Now, 
Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Mikhail S. Gorbachev having indeed met in San 
Francisco, the Pyongyang regime likely finds itself in a state of political 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
For what Gorbachev and Roh agreed is that Seoul and Moscow would work to resume 
the diplomatic ties they last had in the early years of this century, before 
either the Soviet Union or the Republic of Korea had come into existence. 
Meanwhile, they will expand their economic, trade and cultural relations. From 
a conversation in San Francisco lasting only about an hour has come yet another 
milestone in this era of remarkable international change. 
</P>
<P>
The historic significance of the Roh-Gorbachev agreement lies in the fact that 
the Soviet Union was, quite literally, the creator of the North Korean 
Communist state that to this day actively menaces its southern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The division of the Korean peninsula at the 38th Parallel was a tragic and 
unintended consequence of the Allied victory in World War II, the almost-casual 
result of an administrative decision that the Red Army should accept the 
surrender of Japanese forces in northern Korea. Once there, though, the Soviets 
refused to get out, withdrawing only after they had cemented in power the 
Stalinist Kim Il Sung, whose dictatorship goes on. The costly three-year war 
that Kim launched against the south in 1950 was fully supported by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
For Seoul, improved ties with Moscow can only work further to isolate Kim's 
repressive and increasingly friendless regime. For Moscow, the major appeal is 
a chance to benefit from South Korea's burgeoning economic development and 
expertise. The Soviets are eager for Korean help, especially in joint ventures 
to develop Siberia. In recent years, trade between the two countries has 
expanded markedly, from $600 million last year to an expected $1 billion this 
year. South Korea could provide much of the high-quality, low-cost consumer 
goods the Soviets desperately want. 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to assess the full implications of closer Seoul-Moscow ties. 
Plainly, they could reach far. For example China, which already does billions 
in trade with South Korea, is also eager to attract Korean investors. Beijing 
may now feel compelled to pursue its own closer ties with Seoul. Peace isn't 
about to break out on the Korean peninsula; the demilitarized zone between 
north and south remains the world's most heavily fortified border. But the 
regional political rearrangements now under way can only work in time to erode 
that barrier.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNSHOT NARROWLY MISSES OFFICER'S HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank police officer narrowly escaped death when a gang member fired a gun 
at him from close range, so close that the officer's face was burned by 
gunpowder, but the bullet missed, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Brent Ambrose, 27, was treated for facial burns after the 11:45 p.m. 
incident Monday at an apartment complex in the 600 block of East Angeleno 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Miller, 24, a South-Central Los Angeles gang member who barricaded 
himself in an apartment where he had attempted to rob three women, later 
surrendered and was charged Tuesday with attempted murder of a police officer, 
assault and attempted robbery, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when a mother and her two daughters awoke while Miller was 
ransacking their apartment, Goldberg said. One woman called police and then 
fled from the apartment. A second was held at gunpoint by Miller but when he 
was distracted, she jumped through a window. Police said Miller fired a shot at 
the woman but missed. The third woman hid under a bed while Miller roamed the 
apartment looking for valuables. 
</P>
<P>
Police surrounded the apartment and called for Miller to surrender. He 
allegedly walked to a door where Ambrose was positioned, opened it and fired a 
shot at the officer before going back inside. No shots were returned by police 
because of the woman who remained inside. A short time later, after police 
talked to Miller on the phone, he surrendered. He was being held without bail 
at the Burbank Jail.

BURBANK AIRPORT PLANS MAY FACE RIGOROUS SCRUTINY; 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION: THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL HAS CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED THE AIRPORT 
AUTHORITY TO SUBMIT ITS 2,000-FOOT TAXIWAY PROPOSAL TO THE CITY FOR APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest chapter of a longstanding feud, the Los Angeles City Council on 
Tuesday conditionally approved requiring Burbank Airport to submit its plans 
for a 2,000-foot taxiway to rigorous scrutiny by the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal wins final council approval, its significance may be tested as 
early as mid-July when Burbank Airport expects to begin building its Taxiway B 
extension. Los Angeles has complained for years about airport noise and is 
eager to block any plans that would sharply expand the airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority spokesman Victor Gill said that the 
proposed law is moot and illegal, and that the authority has no plans to accede 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Supreme Court has previously prohibited cities from imposing special 
land-use restrictions on land already zoned for airport use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gill called the move another attempt by the city to prevent takeoffs and 
landings along the airport's main north-south runway. The southern approaches 
to the runway are over neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out if it's meaningless," said Greg Nelson, a chief deputy in Los 
Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs' office. "We're certainly not going to take 
Burbank Airport's word that our legislation means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
To be enacted, the proposed zoning ordinance must be approved a second time by 
the council, receiving at least 12 votes from the 15-member council. The 
measure needs more than a bare majority because it would override an earlier 
Planning Commission decision and because Wachs wants the measure to become 
effective as soon as it is published -- instead of after the normal 30-day 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will come back to the council for further action next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that before anything is permitted to be developed on this 
site that it go through a full environmental review and that the matter come to 
the council for approval," Wachs said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that the land will be used to expand the number of flights 
into and out of the airport, and anything that would be done in this regard is 
of enormous concern to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gill said extending the taxiway would not allow an increase in airport 
traffic nor is it related to the terminal expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the extension is a safety step, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft now using Taxiway B must cross the north-south runway to prepare for 
takeoff, a maneuver that would be unnecessary if the extension is built. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a good safety situation," Gill said. "It's not dangerous, but it 
creates an opportunity for accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Under the zoning measure voted on Tuesday, the airport would be required to get 
Planning Commission approval for any construction project on land within the 
boundaries of the city of Los Angeles, including the 54 acres where the Airport 
Authority wants to build the extension. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission would have to find that any construction would be 
beneficial to the public and would not harm other developments already in the 
area, and that all negative environmental impacts would have to be remedied in 
order to endorse any proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
Gill said such terms would make it politically impossible for the airport to 
win any land-use permits at Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Taxiway B expansion project has been under consideration by the airport 
since 1985.

CLOSURE OF STREETS NEAR LOW-INCOME PROJECT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council Tuesday voted to close portions of two public 
streets that intersect the crime-ridden San Fernando Gardens housing project, 
the first phase of a long-awaited plan to upgrade security. 
</P>
<P>
The street closures, approved without debate on a 10-0 vote, are needed to 
restrict access to the 448-unit project, said David Mays, chief deputy for City 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the area. A nearly 1-mile-long, 
8-foot-tall wrought iron fence will then be built around the low-income housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The street closures are a first step forward and everyone is very excited," 
Mays said. Closed will be Lehigh Avenue between Van Nuys Boulevard and Pierce 
Street, and Carl Street between Pala Avenue and Lehigh. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who introduced the street closure plan, was not present during the 
council's consideration of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to enclose San Fernando Gardens, whose 2,000 tenants are mostly 
Latinos, including 1,500 children, caused a brief flap during Bernardi's 1989 
reelection bid. Lyle Hall, Bernardi's major foe, insinuated that the 
incumbent's support of the fencing plan was racially motivated. However, Hall's 
comments backfired with tenants of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing this at the request of the housing project's tenant's 
association," Mays said. "We have continuing crime problems there, most of them 
drug-related. The community wants to have more control over their environment 
and this . . . will help." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Hal Bernson has said a similar enclosure of Park Parthenia, a 
60-building private housing project in his district in Northridge, proved to be 
an effective crime-fighting tool. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Housing Authority, which owns and operates the project, has the 
$400,000 needed to erect the fence, and construction should be completed within 
two to three months, Mays said. Two entrances to the housing project will 
remain when the fence is built, and the authority is seeking grants to hire 
security guards to man the entrances, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Bernardi is supporting a plan to build a 5,300-square-foot 
community center that would house day-care, social services and recreational 
facilities for the project. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Gardens is the only city housing project that does not have such a 
facility.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN, 19, GETS 8 YEARS IN DRUNK-DRIVING DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Arleta man was sentenced Tuesday to eight years in prison for 
causing an accident that killed two people and injured nine others while 
driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles called David Solis Sahagun "a 
danger to the community" as he sentenced him for the Oct. 8, 1988, crash that 
killed Essie Sutton and Ramiro Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
The injured included three of Sutton's children, her nephew and cousin. 
</P>
<P>
Sahagun was convicted in March on two counts of vehicular manslaughter and two 
counts of driving under the influence of alcohol. He could have received a 
maximum sentence of about 12 years, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver said. 
</P>
<P>
Sahagun was traveling 75 to 80 m.p.h. northbound on Arleta Avenue at Terra 
Bella Street at about 2:30 a.m. when he ran a red light and struck the 
passenger side of a car in which Sutton was riding. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Pacoima woman and five other passengers were thrown from the 
car. She was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Juarez, 18, of Arleta, a passenger in Sahagun's car, died several days later in 
a local hospital after being kept alive on life-support systems. Sahagun and 
another passenger in his car were also injured. 
</P>
<P>
Sahagun admitted to friends that he had taken acid and smoked marijuana the 
night of the crash, according to testimony. His blood-alcohol level after the 
crash was measured at 0.16%, twice the amount required to prove a case of 
driving under the influence, Dver said.

BLIND SKIER TESTS HIMSELF SO THAT OTHERS MIGHT SEE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAILBLAZER: GREG EVANGELATOS OF SHERMAN OAKS HOPES THAT HIS DERRING-DO WILL 
CREATE A PUBLIC AWARENESS TOWARD OTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SIGHT BUT NOT THEIR 
DRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Evangelatos is at the top of Mammoth Mountain, about to take his first 
ride on a run called the Cornice. Reaching up to the sky like a frozen tidal 
wave, the Cornice is the hill of choice for thrill-seeking skiers. The 
faint-hearted are warned to stay on their chairlifts. Evangelatos stands on the 
precipice and thinks back to the first time he ever saw the Cornice. He was in 
his early teens, a novice skier. The bunny run was merely intimidating, but the 
Cornice was worse, the great unknown. He remembers telling his family that 
there was no way he could ever ski it. But that was then. Kids grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos pushes off from the lip of the Cornice and makes it to the bottom, 
conquering both the mountain and teen-age angst in one glorious swoop. He heads 
for the lodge: It's Miller Time. 
</P>
<P>
This might sound like just another coming-of-age story, but it has a special 
twist. In between the time he first saw the Cornice and first skied it, 
Evangelatos lost his sight. 
</P>
<P>
What he didn't have the courage to do when he could see he managed to 
accomplish in total darkness. To him, his journey down the Cornice is a 
metaphor for overcoming obstacles and living a go-for-broke lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people, they just live their lives in a dark corner," says Evangelatos, 
now 28. "But you can't fear the unknown. You have to have challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Blinded in a fireworks accident 10 years ago, Evangelatos lost his sight but 
found meaning and purpose in his life. "I want to prove to myself and to others 
that the blind can do everything they want, that we can lead just as exciting a 
life as anybody," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most people would find Evangelatos' life too exciting. He water skis, sky dives 
from 12,000 feet and speed skates on Venice Beach. Everything he does is done 
at breakneck speed, especially skiing. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a blind skier -- or a lot of sighted ones -- who can keep up with 
him. A few weeks ago, he won two gold medals, including the overall title, at 
the World Disabled Championships in Winter Park, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Blind skiers follow closely behind guides, who shout directions over their 
shoulders like "hard left" or "big right." Evangelatos and his guide, Robey 
Lizama of Gardnerville, Nev., often reach speeds of 50 m.p.h., which doesn't 
leave much margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
At the worlds, Lizama slowed too quickly at the finish line and Evangelatos ran 
up on his skis, got tangled and went tumbling, breaking his left collarbone. 
The next day, arm taped to his side, he won a bronze medal in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a one-armed skier," Evangelatos says, adding with irony, "for 
once, I felt like I was skiing with a disability." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos is talking in the living room of his parents' Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
Outside by the swimming pool, Ricky, a golden Amazon parrot, is tormenting the 
family dog, an old pit bull named Samson, by chirping his name and doing a 
pretty good barking imitation. Samson comes inside. Evangelatos gets up and 
closes a sliding door to muffle the sound of the parrot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she likes doing that to him," he says with a laugh before heading to 
the kitchen. A moment later, he returns with a cup of coffee and sits down. 
"When I blew myself up, that old dog lay next to me and wouldn't leave until 
the firemen came to take me away." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos has no trouble talking about the accident that changed his life a 
decade ago. Like the occasional foolhardy 18-year-old, he was trying to make 
the world's biggest firecracker by dismantling bottle rockets and mixing the 
powder in a porcelain bowl. But the powder suddenly exploded, taking his sight 
and mangling his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
The next few months were physical and emotional torture. "I didn't want to live 
any more," Evangelatos says. "I felt so ugly. I felt I'd be an outcast in 
society the rest of my life. I pictured myself on an L.A. corner with a tin 
cup. I didn't want to go on." 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital, his sister, Patricia, read him an article about a blind skier 
named Mike May, who was a world champion. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, Evangelatos was attending the Braille Institute in 
L.A. when his judo instructor mentioned a ski program run by the local chapter 
of National Handicapped Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos began skiing, disregarding the caution of his youth. Within a year, 
he had won the overall championship at the U.S. Assn. of Blind Athletes 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I got bored with regular slopes," he says. "The advanced runs were the 
challenge that gave me excitement, and racing became the challenge in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, Evangelatos was coasting along "without any plans or 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
He played football at Birmingham High -- he was a 5-foot-8, 170-pound starter 
at running back and defensive end -- but didn't distinguish himself 
athletically. College was a possibility, "but I didn't know what I wanted to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
His disability suddenly gave him a cause. "I know when I accomplish something," 
he says, "I open doors for blind people." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteering at the Foundation for the Junior Blind's summer camp program, "I 
try to be a role model," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help children realize their recreational capabilities and understand 
that they can make their dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos' father, a lawyer, helped him set up Demo Video Inc., a nonprofit 
production company that specializes in educational videos. If he can get 
corporate sponsors, he hopes to distribute the videos to schools to increase 
society's awareness of the capabilities of the blind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to educate children so they don't think blind people are 
foreign creatures who belong in an institution," Evangelatos says. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, Evangelatos proves that being blind doesn't have to be a prison 
sentence. He trains in Colorado during the ski season and attends L.A. City 
College in the off-season, majoring in radio and TV. Although he usually lives 
with his parents, he's moving into a Venice Beach apartment this summer so he 
can train on roller blades. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg is very independent," says Lizama, his guide for the past three years. 
"On the slopes he's really aggressive and likes to go for it. He's the same way 
in his living skills. We lived together last winter. He was never timid walking 
around the room and he always figured out how to get to the local lodges and 
the Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
"One time at a restaurant, he got mad at me over something we were discussing 
and just took off. He wasn't afraid to go alone." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't surprise Lizama. "Greg," he says, "is definitely not scared of 
the unknown."

DRAFT TAKES SOME PLAYERS BY SURPRISE

<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy High outfielder Garret Anderson was nothing short of amazed when 
informed that the Angels had drafted him in the fourth round of baseball's 
amateur draft Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He had heard whispers that professional scouts weren't exactly impressed by his 
work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think the scouts liked me," said Anderson, who batted .393, hit eight 
homers and drove in 36 runs. "Everybody said I don't play hard. I think 
everybody has a certain style of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Manny Alvarado, for whom Anderson has played the past two years, 
said that some scouts' perception that Anderson is undermotivated is just plain 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people otherwise," Alvarado said. 
"He's a sweetheart of a kid." 
</P>
<P>
If Anderson was surprised at how high he was selected, then Birmingham's Dan 
Larson must have been in shock. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, an outfielder who said he thought he might be selected as high as the 
sixth or seventh round, was plucked in the third round by Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Anderson and other area players who already have signed to play next 
season at NCAA Division I schools, Larson faces an unsettled situation that 
could cost him during contract talks. Larson can't use a Division I ride as 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, however, said he is considering playing at Cal State Northridge. But 
Northridge's interest, like that of the Phillies, is a rather new development. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Rosselli's situation is more complicated than most. Like many area 
players, the pitcher from Alemany has committed to play baseball at a Division 
I school. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosselli has more to consider than merely whether he prefers to play at 
Arizona State or with the San Francisco Giants, who selected him in the second 
round. Rosselli is also considered a candidate for quarterback on the Sun Devil 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, however, is winning at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a better career opportunity," said Rosselli, a 6-foot-1 
left-hander who was Alemany's starting quarterback the past three seasons. "As 
far as college football goes, I'm not the biggest quarterback around. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll probably have twice as many years in baseball if I make it to the 
pros. The love of the game is there more for baseball than football." STEVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Josh Etting and Che Naveja of Kennedy High will play University's Lucas 
Goldstein and Sung Kim at 2 p.m. today in the doubles final of the City Section 
Individual Tennis Championships at the Racquet Centre of Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Etting and Naveja, seeded fifth in the tournament, advanced Monday with a 6-3, 
6-1 semifinal victory over top-seeded Ardy Ghaffari and Jon Faller of 
Palisades. Goldstein and Kim defeated twins Nam and Long Nguyen of Cleveland, 
7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Eliazar Herrera of Hoover High will compete in the 3,000 meters at the Golden 
West Invitational in Sacramento on Friday. The meet attracts many of nation's 
top senior high school track athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, bound for UCLA, placed second in the 3,200 meters in 8 minutes 58.97 
seconds at last Saturday's state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Mark MacArthur of The Master's College was picked by the St. Louis Cardinals in 
the ninth round of the amateur baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
A senior shortstop, MacArthur led The Master's in runs batted in with 44 and 
batted .340 with eight home runs. MacArthur (6-feet, 180 pounds) graduated from 
L.A. Baptist and is from Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Matt LaBelle, a pitcher at Newbury Park High, has signed a national letter of 
intent with UC Irvine. The senior right-hander chose Irvine over St Mary's, UC 
Santa Barbara and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
LaBelle was 4-1 in limited action with the Panthers. He received most of his 
exposure during the winter-league season as a member of a scout team sponsored 
by the Philadelphia Phillies, according to his father, Bob LaBelle. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Rangers will open a 53-game schedule tonight in Torrance, when they 
play San Bernardino. The Rangers, who will play National Baseball Congress, 
Stan Musial and Goodman Collegiate League teams, will start Cort Wright in 
tonight's game. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Keyaan Cook of Montclair Prep was chosen player of the year by Alpha 
League coaches. 
</P>

Christian. Cook drove in 33 runs and hit five home runs in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gordon of Simi Valley will receive the inaugural Gamer Award, given to the 
Southern California Baseball Player of the Year as chosen by the CenterField 
Athletic Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who hit 15 home runs and had 32 RBIs, will be honored tonight at his 
team's banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Thompson, Stan Wilson and Walter Brooks have orally committed to play 
basketball for Cal State San Bernardino, Antelope Valley Coach Newton Chelette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, San Bernardino is a Division III school and cannot offer athletic 
scholarships, but it will be able to offer scholarships when the school moves 
up to Division II status for the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a 5-8, started 16 games; Wilson, a 6-3 forward, averaged four points; 
and Brooks, a 6-3 guard, averaged 12.2 points for Antelope Valley last season. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons' Ron Robart, the Western State Conference player of the 
year, and Art Chute, who set a Glendale single-season home run record with 11, 
were chosen first-team all-state players in voting by members of the state 
coaches' association. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Robart, first baseman Chute, and Canyons second baseman Steve 
Kovacic were first-team All-Southern California selections. Kovacic was 
second-team all-state.

SPORTS ET CETERA: RENO CUT FROM WCC FOR 1992 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning in 1992, the Nevada Reno baseball team will no longer be a member of 
the West Coast Conference, Commissioner Michael Gilleran announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The WCC Executive Committee made the decision citing travel costs and the 
desire to go to a six-team, all-California conference for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
UNR is a member of the Big Sky in all other sports, but that conference does 
not sponsor baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, UNR was involved in a bench-clearing brawl with the 
University of San Diego that led to the suspension of three coaches -- two from 
USD -- and one player from each school. 
</P>
<P>
Other WCC members for baseball include, Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine, Santa 
Clara, St. Mary's and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Griffin, a graduate of San Dieguito High who hit .343 for Stanford in 1990, 
was selected to the second team of the American Baseball Coaches Assn. 
All-American team. Griffin plays second base. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Rees, a Mission Bay graduate, was named to the third team. Rees, a 
left-handed pitcher, was 13-2 for Arizona State.

<P>
Phil Mickelson, a former San Diego Section golfer of the year from USDHS, will 
try to defend his NCAA Division I title beginning today at the Innisbrook 
Resort's Island course in Tarpon Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Mickelson, of Arizona State, became only the fourth freshman to win 
the individual title, joining Ben Crenshaw (Texas, 1971), Curtis Strange (Wake 
Forest, 1974) and Billy Ray Brown (Houston, 1982). He has won three tournaments 
this spring for the second-ranked Sundevils.

A Pan American World Airways jumbo jet bound for the United States made an 
unscheduled stop at Prestwick Airport near Glasgow, Scotland, after a bomb 
scare, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No explosives were found on the Boeing 747, and it continued its journey after 
five hours on the ground. Police said one passenger, told by another passenger 
that a bomb might have been planted on the plane, relayed the information to 
the crew. Police detained a man traveling on the plane, which was carrying 208 
passengers and crew on a flight from Frankfurt, West Germany, to Washington.

Israeli soldiers shot and killed two boys in the West Bank as Palestinians in 
the occupied territories observed a general strike on the anniversary of the 
Six-Day War.

The 1967 war led to Israeli occupation of the land. Ahmed Salama, 10, was 
killed when soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse stone throwers in the

Texas state legislators in Austin moved quickly on a $528-million school 
financing compromise, raising the sales tax a quarter-cent and passing other 
taxes and fee increases to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in taxes on cocktails and tobacco, as well as some state fees, were 
passed by both houses and sent to Gov. Bill Clements. Democrats in the 
Legislature and the Republican governor agreed on the package last week, after 
being deadlocked three months over how to meet a state Supreme Court order that 
more money be allocated to schools in low-income districts. The legislation 
would add money to a $13.5-billion-a-year school system and raise an extra $100 
million for financially strapped social service programs.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH SEES TO AFFAIRS OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guess what Bryan Dameworth did Saturday night after winning the elusive 
3,200-meter title at the state track and field championships? 
</P>
<P>
 He started packing for the fall semester at the University of Wisconsin? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Winter blowout sales of wool socks and mittens won't come until later this 
year. Try again. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran back to his home in Calabasas from Cerritos College? 
</P>
<P>
 Not even close. That's about 65 miles from point A to point B, but it probably 
wouldn't be a problem if you spotted the Agoura High senior a few days to do 
it. Last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Disneyland? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but thanks for playing. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth finally was able to relax after winning the state 3,200 championship 
in a nation-leading 8 minutes 53.26 seconds -- thus ridding himself of a source 
of considerable frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sort of stayed out all night and kicked back the next day," Dameworth 
said of his post-race activities. 
</P>
<P>
Although pleased with his success in cross-country, the sport in which he won 
three consecutive state Division I titles and last December's Kinney national 
championship, Dameworth had thrice fallen short in his bid for a state track 
title. 
</P>
<P>
He finished seventh in the state 3,200 final as a freshman in 1987 and was 
second last year. As a sophomore, Dameworth failed to make the state meet after 
placing seventh in the Southern Section Masters meet in a then personal-best 
9:06.88. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Dameworth was able to lock up his ghosts of disappointment 
past and throw away the key. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite relieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But his latest accomplishment was by no means a romp in the park. Two other 
Southern Section runners also dipped under the nine-minute barrier and the 
fourth- through 11th-place finishers were under 9:10. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't know (I won) until after I crossed the finish line," Dameworth 
said. "I felt someone on me pretty much the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, that someone was Hoover's Eliazar Herrera. The UCLA-bound 
senior finished second in 8:58.97, currently the third-best mark nationally. 
</P>
<P>
What sapped Dameworth the most, he said, was leading the entire race with the 
exception of a 200-meter stretch when Hector Hernandez of San Diego Mar Vista 
surged past before fading to a 21st-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought, 'Cool, I get to run with someone,' " said Dameworth, a 
notorious front-runner. "But after about 200 he just dropped back." 
</P>
<P>
Knocking down Andy Maris' previous national best of 8:53.78 gave Dameworth 
another reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The senior from White River High (Buckley, Wash.) recorded the time in handing 
Dameworth his first 3,200 loss of the season at the Arcadia Invitational in 
April. Dameworth was second in 8:53.85. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another thing I'm happy about," Dameworth said. "It's not by much (but) 
at least his name's not up there any more." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Golden West and Keebler invitationals remain, Dameworth can 
virtually close the book on what has been four years of mostly blue-ribbon 
performances and eight Times Athlete of the Week selections. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've accomplished everything I would have ever dreamed of," Dameworth 
said. "I'm pretty happy."

No Busing: The Los Angeles bus shelter ads for the June Interview magazine have 
a red slash added by the bus shelter owners, the Gannett Outdoor Co. The 
original magazine cover shows Madonna in what the magazine calls a "mock macho"

has been sitting in a Hudson, N.Y., car pound since May 2, when he was arrested 
on a charge of driving it without license plates and a registration. If Tyson 
doesn't come in and pay, the car will go on the auction block later this month.

No Life?: The 12-foot American elm taken from White House grounds in 1989 and

fighting for its life. The tree was hurt by a late frost after a warm March 
brought out buds. The top of the tree appears lifeless, but buds can be found 
on lower branches. "It is our intent to do everything we can, if the tree can 
be saved, to save it," city forester Paul Blumhardt said.

ONE-OF-A-KIND ANSWERS TO BIG PROM DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If teen-age girls in Southern California have a common complaint each spring, 
it involves their search for the perfect prom dress. 
</P>
<P>
They can't find one. 
</P>
<P>
"I went everywhere, every mall possible, even the Glendale Galleria and I 
couldn't find the dress I wanted," said 17-year-old Stephanie Hartwick, a 
senior at Grant High School in Van Nuys. So she did what her classmate Traci 
Noonan did to get the dress of her dreams: she had it made. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwick had a vision and a rough sketch clasped in her elaborately manicured 
hands when she went to Julie's Bridal shop in Reseda last month. Three weeks 
later she was dancing at the Bonaventure Hotel in her fashion fantasy -- a 
short, strapless, hand-beaded French lace gown. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Burns and Maureen Delaney of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys had 
their dresses made by Julie Yanez, the owner of Julie's Bridal; so did Tiffany 
Jones and Jennifer Lambert of Calabasas High School, and Amy Smith of Miguel 
Leonis High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
These intrepid mall crawlers shared the same horror stories about shopping for 
the finery needed for their end-of-the year proms. Not only could they not find 
the dress they wanted at their usual haunts, they kept seeing the same styles 
over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Burns knew she wanted a dress that no one else would have. She didn't have 
specific details, just a concept. "I wanted a Cinderella dress," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For $350 Yanez played fairy godmother. She made Burns, a soft-spoken young 
woman with delicate features, an extremely feminine, off-the-shoulder, 
full-skirted white dress. 
</P>
<P>
Yanez said most of the girls have very definite ideas about what kind of dress 
they want. They comb Seventeen magazine looking for pictures, and the more 
adventurous will sketch a design their own. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted teal green," said Jones, a dynamo with a shopping list of details 
("short, but still formal, with a train"). "I had a picture in my mind and I 
knew I'd never find it." 
</P>
<P>
Jones drew her master plan for Yanez. Within days she had a $185 dress with a 
giant bowed train that hangs over the shortest skirt Yanez has ever made -- 14 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few of the girls make the dresses too crazy," said Yanez. Considering 
this is one of their first forays into formal attire, "they have pretty good 
taste." 
</P>
<P>
Even Jones' mother, Andrea, who was originally appalled by the brevity of her 
daughter's dress, now approves, but admits her husband probably would not. 
"It's a good thing he'll be New York all week. He won't see it until after 
Tiffany goes to the prom." Andrea Jones was a hard sell. She has a relative who 
designs custom-made bridal dresses and was skeptical about the costs, assuming 
the price would be well over $300. "When Tiffany first suggested having her 
dress made, I said 'no way,' but Julie's prices are much more reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Yanez says that most of her prom dresses run from $150 to $250, but the price 
begins to escalate when beading or French lace is used. "That fabric can run 
$90 a yard." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are surprised at how reasonable the price is," Yanez said, 
"although some don't recognize the benefits in a custom-made dress and they 
think it should cost much less than a store-bought dress." 
</P>
<P>
Even with $200 to $300 burning a hole in their cut-off jeans, these teen-agers 
simply could not find anything to buy at the stores. The quantity of 
off-the-rack choices was limited, they said, as was the number of stores that 
stock prom dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Sizing can also be a problem. Many of the girls, like Jones, are petite; others 
don't have the curves to fill out a junior size.

C. W. Designs, a Tarzana-based company, has rushed to fill these two voids -- 
party dresses in general and sizing in particular -- in the garment industry. 
The 5-year-old company specializes in hard-to-fit, teen-ager and preteen party 
dresses. The demand for their special-occasion dresses has been so great they 
have opened their factory warehouse for retail-priced custom orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls come in here and design their own dresses," said one of the two owners, 
Miriam Schwartz. "They can choose the sleeves off of one style, the skirt from 
another, and the kind of neckline they want. Then the dress is custom-fitted 
for the customer." Depending on the choice of fabric, the dresses run from $140 
to $550. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made about 30 or 40 prom dress this season, and for those girls it 
always has to be something that no else has. They want their dress to be 
unique," said co-owner Bobbi Feinstein. "For the prom they inevitably want it 
strapless and in black." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more appealing designs created by the customers are picked up by 
Feinstein and Schwartz and added to their wholesale line. The samples are then 
named after their teen-age innovators. The "Kari" is a black velvet dress with 
a sweetheart neckline, pleated lace skirt and rhinestone trim around the 
dropped waistline. 
</P>
<P>
The "Arlene" is a stunner. It was designed by a 17-year-old customer, although 
it looks like it came from Christian Dior in the '40s. The dress is made of an 
iridescent blue/purple satin with an off-the-shoulder neckline and sweeping 
full skirt with one large pleat in the center. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls are pretty sophisticated shoppers by the time they are 13 here in 
Southern California," said Feinstein. But it isn't just the high school 
students who are developing a taste for the custom-made. Feinstein and Schwartz 
have made a strapless party dress for a demanding 4-year-old.

JACK SMITH: IN THE HAZE OF JET LAG, THE RECOLLECTIONS OF A TOURIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I said in my final report on our trip to Egypt and Israel, I would consider 
myself lucky if half my facts were right. I was traveling as a tourist, not a 
reporter, and most of my impressions were recalled through an almost fatal case 
of jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eugene D. Erman of Encino verifies my judgment that Middle Eastern wine 
tastes of vinegar. He recalls that 23 years ago, when he was staying in the 
Jordanian Inter-Continental hotel overlooking the divided city of Jerusalem, a 
bottle of wine came with a pop-bottle top, and a Frenchman in his group tasted 
it and spit it out in disgust. Dr. Erman's mention of the Inter-Continental 
reminds me of a story told by two of our tour companions, a man and wife. It 
has the sound of an urban myth, but in this case it came to me from the 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
In the labyrinthine bazaar of Old City Jerusalem they became separated. Each 
took separate cabs back to what they supposed was our hotel. We were staying at 
the Hyatt, but the man thought it was the Hilton. When he reached the Hilton he 
realized his mistake and told the driver to take him to the Hyatt. However, the 
driver insisted on giving him a tour of the Mount of Olives. The man said he 
did not want to go to the Mount of Olives. He wanted to go to the Hyatt. The 
driver took him to the Mount of Olives, and then to the Hyatt. The fare was 
$30. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his wife had forgotten the name of our hotel and told the driver to 
take her to the Inter-Continental, which sounded familiar. (It happened to be 
the last hotel we had stayed in in Egypt.) When she arrived, she thought it 
didn't look familiar, but thought maybe she was being let off at a side door. 
She asked at the desk for her room number and was directed to a certain room. 
When she got there an Arab opened the door. His entire family was inside. In 
time, (and in some disarray) she arrived at the Hyatt and joined her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Harrison of Corona del Mar sends a diary kept by her sixth-grader Ann, 
which has a passage that explains in chilling detail why I didn't choose to 
enter Cheop's pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we went inside this huge pyramid. . . . It was very hot and humid 
inside. We were in a line that was moving inch by inch. . . . We came to a very 
small, long passageway that led up a steep incline. There were people coming 
down as we were squeezing and crouching and trying to climb up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At that point I would have been screaming, "Let me outta here!" 
</P>
<P>
Barton H. Emmet of Santa Barbara recalls an even more traumatic experience in 
the pyramid. Back in 1928, when he was 9 years old and his father was naval 
attache at The Hague, his mother took him and his 11-year-old brother and 
10-year-old sister to visit Egypt, with their tutor, Binkie. When they entered 
the Cheops inner passage they were accompanied by six Arabs. As they entered 
the king's chamber, Binkie stumbled on a low step and sprained her ankle. 
Emmet's mother fainted. 
</P>
<P>
"There we were -- three children, six Arabs who spoke no English, and mother 
unconscious on the floor. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At least, in 1928, there would have been no crowd of tourists to make things 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
My older son Curt, who did a graduate year in geography at UCLA, advises me 
that I appeared to place Egypt in the wrong hemisphere. "For us who live in the 
Northern Hemisphere," I wrote, "it is hard to understand that upper Egypt is 
south, and lower Egypt is north." Of course, Egypt is several hundred miles 
above the Equator, entirely in the Northern Hemisphere. What makes southern 
Egypt upper, and northern Egypt lower, is the Nile, which flows north, unlike 
the Mississippi, and gives Egypt its identity. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Butler of Santa Maria also applauds my Egyptian diet of bread, potatoes 
and beer. On their Egyptian tour he and his wife had one boiled egg and a piece 
of dry toast for breakfast, then stuck to bread and potatoes. "Stella beer 
filled the void, along with American Snickers. . . . After two weeks of this I 
was well, as was my dear wife, while the rest of our little group were at 
various times on the brink of death." 
</P>
<P>
But I'm still a jet lag zombie.

The Thomas J. Watson Foundation is paying Doug Dunston $13,000 to get out of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Way out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Basel, Switzerland, to be exact, where Dunston plans to spend a year learning 
the ancient art of trumpet making and living on "bread, beer and chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
Dunston, 21, was recently graduated from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont with 
a degree in physics. Although he plans eventually to seek a Ph.D. in the 
subject, the Watson fellowship will give him a chance to to do something 
"totally out of the mainstream," Dunston said. 
</P>
<P>
He has obtained an unpaid apprenticeship in the Basel workshop of Rainer Egger, 
who works with a four-person staff to painstakingly handcraft fewer than 20 
baroque trumpets each year. 
</P>
<P>
Dunston, a native of Glenview, Ill., said his world travels so far have taken 
him as far as, well, Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't know what to expect from his year abroad. Egger has found 
him an apartment near the shop, and Dunston has been taking intensive classes 
in German so that he can communicate with his new employer when he starts work 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine how it's going to be," Dunston said. "But I'm ready to accept 
whatever Europe throws my way." 
</P>
<P>
The Watson fellowship program, founded in 1968, supports independent foreign 
research and travel for recent graduates of 55 private colleges and 
universities around the nation. Candidates must be nominated by their schools. 
Dunston is one of 76 graduating seniors, including six from San Gabriel Valley 
colleges, to be selected this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very dynamic young man," said Steven Licata, executive director of the 
Watson Foundation, with headquarters in Providence, R.I. "He is creative and 
personable. . . . You're instantly impressed by him." 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the fellowship, Licata said, is to create a Wanderjahr -- a year to 
wander and explore. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal has to be something that is personally relevant, not necessarily 
unusual," Licata said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they give you $13,000 to get out of the country for a year," 
deadpanned Dunston, who has been playing brass instruments since he was in the 
fourth grade. During his four years at Harvey Mudd, he played in the Claremont 
Chamber Orchestra and the Pomona Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my first concert. I was so excited," Dunston recalled of his 
elementary school debut. "I played really harsh and loud, but I played the 
blues. . . . What a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Dunston said he has a particular affinity for the baroque trumpet -- a long, 
straight tube with a "magical air about it" used primarily in Renaissance and 
baroque music. 
</P>
<P>
Although not widely played since the invention of valve trumpets in 1813, 
baroque trumpets are regaining popularity among musicians who want to capture 
the original sound. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of life in these instruments," Dunston said. "It's such a great 
feeling to play Mozart or Bach on the same instrument that was used then." 
</P>
<P>
Dunston's plan for his Wanderjahr is one of the most lighthearted of the 
proposals submitted by 1990 Watson Fellowship recipients from San Gabriel 
Valley colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The other local fellows are Chris Billingham of Scripps College, who will 
travel to Sweden, Norway and Australia to study leadership roles of women in 
business; Jennifer Finlay of Pitzer College, who will study the roles of ethnic 
Chinese women in Singapore and Malaysia; Laurie Guggenheim of Pomona College, 
who will study the sociology of deaf communities in France, Germany and 
England; Jennifer Ann Low of Caltech, who will study the epidemiology and 
sociology of AIDS in Rwanda, Zaire and Belgium, and Ivan Svitek of Claremont 
McKenna College, who will study East European refugee camps in Austria, England 
and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The project isn't the most important thing," said Margo Berman, a member of 
the Watson selection committee at Harvey Mudd College and a former recipient of 
the fellowship. "The greatest benefit is the increased sense of independence 
that you get. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to be in a university setting, where everything is planned on 
schedule. . . . You're going to be completely on your own, learning to survive 
in a new country." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dunston does have one particular goal in mind -- a project that will 
combine his musical and scientific talents. In Switzerland, he hopes to design 
for himself a "very unique trumpet" that will be "a symphony in itself."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: JINGOISTIC NBC WAVES THE FLAG AT THE FRENCH OPEN; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: CLEARLY THE NETWORK BELIEVES ITS RATINGS DEPEND ON COVERING U.S. 
PLAYERS TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Flag-waving NBC Sports just doesn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
Its jingoistic coverage of the French Open -- one of four Grand Slam events on 
the professional tennis circuit -- is for the America-first crowd. It's also 
for people who don't like tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the French love their Yannick Noah, the Germans their Boris Becker and 
Steffi Graf. And Andres Gomez is probably idolized in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
Except for intense national rivalries spun from Davis Cup competition, however, 
pro tennis today is a sport whose heroes are international. Thanks largely to 
their exposure on television, they belong to a global tennis public. It's a 
beautiful thing: After hearing the first thwock of a tennis ball, your 
awareness of national boundaries vanishes and the only lines that matter are 
the ones that frame the court. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis spectator's biggest joy comes not from a misplaced patriotism -- the 
United States against the world -- but from watching a universal cast of 
athletes participating in a wonderfully entertaining sport. 
</P>
<P>
But now come those super-patriot pragmatists at NBC Sports who seem to believe 
that rallying around the flag will increase tennis ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an All-American day," NBC's Dick Enberg crowed Sunday, ignoring the 
existence of players from other nations still alive in the Paris tournament. Of 
course, within the narrow realm of NBC's coverage, it was an All-American day. 
</P>
<P>
NBC beamed that message home right away by superimposing pictures of Americans 
Andre Agassi, Michael Chang, Jim Courier and Jennifer Capriati over an American 
flag blowing in a breeze. Were viewers supposed to jump to their feet and say 
the Pledge of Allegiance? 
</P>
<P>
Although the tournament had begun almost a week earlier, Saturday was NBC's 
first day of coverage. It began in the afternoon with taped coverage of 
Capriati's win over Austrian Judith Wiesner. Very nice. Capriati is certainly a 
big story. 
</P>
<P>
Uh . . . except that the entire match already had been shown hours earlier on 
ESPN, whose own six-days-a-week coverage (6-11 a.m.) continues to be vastly 
better than NBC's. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati twice in one day? 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old Capriati is obviously not only an extraordinary tennis talent 
who has earned remarkable early success, but also a simply swell kid who seems 
refreshingly unspoiled. She chews gum. She giggles. She probably even 
baby-sits. 
</P>
<P>
But enough already. The media-aimed white-hot spotlight -- Capriati has already 
made the cover of Newsweek -- is starting to singe. It's bad for her, raising 
expectations to the point that if she fails to win a Grand Slam title by age 16 
she'll probably be labeled a flop. And it's bad for us. 
</P>
<P>
Shades of Mary Lou Retton, the overpublicized micro-gymnast who ultimately wore 
out her welcome with a frozen, toothy smile that could curl your neck hairs. In 
spite of being so likable, Capriati is starting to have the same grating effect 
due to the sheer volume of her exposure. 
</P>
<P>
It's apparent that NBC believes that its tennis ratings depend on giving 
infinitely greater exposure to U.S. players than to others. Business is 
business. But turning pro tennis into a celebration of America is going much 
too far. 
</P>
<P>
After the Capriati match came NBC's long rehash of Chang's route to last year's 
French Open championship, followed by a review of Chang's progress in this 
year's tournament, followed by a bloated interview with American John McEnroe 
(who isn't even playing in the French Open). In other words, NBC seemed to 
prefer dusting off stale matches with Americans rather than showing fresher 
matches with non-Americans. And did NBC really believe viewers would prefer 
hearing McEnroe talk than seeing someone else play? 
</P>
<P>
How far behind was NBC? "Don't discount (Aaron) Krickstein," Enberg said about 
the American player who five hours earlier on ESPN was shown being ousted from 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, NBC was so absorbed in showing Agassi's entire match with Courier, 
along with two brief excerpts of Capriati's crushing of Argentine Mercedes Paz, 
that you might have thought no other players remained in the tournament. NBC 
waited until 95 of its 120 minutes of coverage had elapsed before reporting the 
day's other French Open scores. 
</P>
<P>
The French Open also has marked the debut of NBC's new tennis commentators, 
Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert, and their initial TV work mirrored their tennis 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
Connors frequently had something to say, and said it aggressively (although not 
very articulately). He's made a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Evert spoke about as often on NBC as she came to the net on the tennis court, 
which was almost never. In encouraging her to say more during Saturday's 
Capriati-Wiesner match, poor Enberg sounded as if he were pulling words from a 
tar pit. And when Evert did comment, it was usually from the perspective of her 
unofficial protege, Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
Evert did a little better Sunday, but on this day the main focus was not 
Capriati's match, but Agassi-Courier. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasting with NBC, ESPN's French Open telecasts have been outstanding, 
giving tennis the global context it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The ESPN performances are not all good. Barry Tomkins is an able studio man but 
a lousy tennis announcer. And morning after morning, Kim Prince's updates of 
scores are an adventure. But the core of talent -- former players Mary Carillo, 
Cliff Drysdale and Fred Stolle -- continues to be the best in the tennis 
telecasting business. 
</P>
<P>
If you love tennis, try ESPN at 6 a.m. There's something mesmerizing about 
watching at that time of morning. The ESPN commentators not only describe 
tennis, moreover, they discuss it in an intelligent way that no one on NBC, 
except for Bud Collins, seems prepared to do. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has another agenda. This weekend it covers the conclusion of the French 
Open -- whose title it also superimposed over a U.S. flag -- before traveling 
to another tennis venue in England. "Later this month," said Enberg, "the 
Americans venture to Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Americans. And NBC Sports will be with them, Old Glory unfurled.

'MONOPOLY' PASSES GO; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SOME AFFILIATES FEAR THAT ABC'S PIGGYBACKING OF GRIFFIN/KING WORLD 
GAME SHOWS COULD PUT THEM IN JEOPARDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With one roll of the dice, the TV game show "Monopoly" moved from jail to 
Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
In late April, King World Entertainment and Merv Griffin Enterprises had 
withdrawn their proposed "Monopoly" game show from the syndication market for 
lack of sufficient interest. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a little midget jumping around on the board," recalled one station 
program director who turned down the show. "They had a midget dressed up in a 
tuxedo and he'd jump around. That didn't fly, folks." 
</P>
<P>
It was yet another setback for producer Griffin, who had been trying to sell 
various versions of the famous Atlantic City board game for nearly three years, 
and an embarrassment for King World, which distributes the three biggest hits 
in syndication, "Wheel of Fortune," "Jeopardy!" and "The Oprah Winfrey Show." 
</P>
<P>
Then, just a few weeks later, ABC -- which had rejected the show for its 
daytime schedule last fall -- announced that it was putting "Monopoly" on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
In prime time. 
</P>
<P>
"Monopoly" will debut June 16 at 8:30 p.m., following a prime-time version of 
"Jeopardy!" called "Super Jeopardy!" 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the reason that "Monopoly" made such a dramatic reincarnation. 
ABC wanted to punch up its summer schedule and thought first-run installments 
of the popular "Jeopardy!" would be a relatively inexpensive way of doing it; 
Griffin and King said fine -- provided the network also took "Monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think one game show is as strong as two, and when you have a property 
that is as strong as 'Jeopardy!' -- that is building as much as 'Jeopardy!' is 
now -- it's risky to add another day to it, especially in prime time," said 
Michael King, president of King World. "Part of our investment was to have a 
brand-new game show on the air along with it." 
</P>
<P>
Would he have sold "Jeopardy!" alone, had ABC refused to take "Monopoly"? 
</P>
<P>
"Would we want to see it on, just 'Jeopardy!' all by itself? I don't think so," 
King said. "We definitely wanted to see 'Monopoly' get on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Not that they had to do a lot of arm-twisting. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get a big fight from us on 'Monopoly,' " said Ted Harbert, 
executive vice president of ABC Entertainment. He said that he and his boss, 
ABC Entertainment President Bob Iger, were persuaded to give the show a chance 
by watching a run-through of a revamped version of the game (without the 
midget) and by King's argument that game shows work better in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little downside in this for us," Harbert explained. "It would be 
hard to perform a lot worse (in that Saturday-night time period) than we 
already are." Indeed, ABC often ran fourth there last season with "Mission: 
Impossible" and, later, "Elvis," behind NBC, CBS and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with "Monopoly" heretofore has been streamlining a board 
game that takes hours to play into a 30-minute TV format. Harbert thinks 
Griffin has finally managed it with a version that has three players competing 
each week in three rounds of acquiring properties and trying to build hotels on 
them, with a bonus round for the winner. The program will be hosted by Michael 
Reilly, a former "Jeopardy!" contestant. 
</P>
<P>
Some ABC affiliates say "Monopoly's" lackluster reception in the syndication 
market was due as much to an overcrowded game show market as to problems with 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It needed some work. It had some flaws," said Don Lundy, program director for 
KGTV-TV, the ABC station in San Diego. "But it was a particularly tough market 
I think this year for game shows, with some fairly strong entries out there." 
</P>
<P>
He cited two new games -- "Challengers" and "Trump Card" -- and revivals of 
"Tic Tac Dough" and "Joker's Wild" as examples. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, some ABC affiliates are more concerned about the decision to put 
"Jeopardy!" in prime time -- the stations already carry the syndicated version, 
which in many markets airs on Saturdays at either 7 or 7:30 p.m., right before 
ABC's "Super Jeopardy!," which will be seen at 8 p.m. They are worried that the 
network version either could overexpose the game or draw away viewers who want 
to see only one installment a night and opt for the network's. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody would be concerned, only because it's the unknown," said Larry 
Cazavan, program director at WTSP-TV, the ABC affiliate in Tampa, Fla. "We're 
trying to get viewers. So you're just concerned. I would be as much concerned, 
for instance, if ABC put 'I Love Lucy' in at 8 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
But A.R. Van Contfort, program manager of WSP-TV, the ABC affiliate in Atlanta, 
maintained that the benefits of bringing game shows back to prime time are 
likely to be more beneficial than harmful -- even if it means showing two 
versions of "Jeopardy!" in one evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think it 's terrific," he said. "ABC wasn't doing so well on 
Saturday night, and there's no question that game shows on prime time have 
historically done very well." 
</P>
<P>
Harbert said that the network didn't mean to upset its affiliates and expressed 
hope that they would understand ABC's efforts to improve the prime-time 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
And if "Jeopardy!" and "Monopoly" should prove to be prime-time hits? 
</P>
<P>
"We're still planning to put 'Young Riders' on come fall (on Saturdays at 8 
p.m.)," Harbert said, "but we're not swimming in so much luxury here that if 
these shows worked we wouldn't find a way to keep them going. We call those 
good problems."

years. While the project itself has been around for that long in other hands, 
Griffin came aboard as producer only about seven months ago.

'THE SIMPSONS' JUMPS INTO THE TOP 10; 
</P>
<P>
RATINGS: A RERUN OF FOX'S ANIMATED SERIES DEFEATS NBC'S 'THE COSBY SHOW.' THE 
TWO COMEDIES WILL SQUARE OFF FOR REAL NEXT SEASON.

Homer Simpson's environmental crusade last Sunday propelled the Fox animated 
series "The Simpsons" to the young network's first top-10 finish in the weekly 
ratings, according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
Seen in nearly 14.5 million homes nationwide, "The Simpsons" tied ABC's 
"America's Funniest Home Videos" for fourth among last week's 87 prime-time 
shows, trailing only "Cheers" on NBC, "Roseanne" on ABC and NBC's premiere of 
"Seinfeld," which held fast to most of the people who watched the show ahead of 
it, "Cheers." "Seinfeld" was the only first-run program to finish in the top 50 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Fox bragged Tuesday that "The Simpsons" was seen in about 370,000 more homes 
than NBC's "The Cosby Show," which managed only a tie for eighth in its 
Thursday time period. In perhaps the boldest move of the upcoming fall season, 
Fox plans to move "The Simpsons" to Thursdays to compete directly with "Cosby," 
this past season's No. 2-rated show behind "Roseanne" and the unchallenged 
ratings king of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But last week was the first week of summer schedules, and the surfeit of reruns 
on all four networks and the warm weather in much of the country combined to 
reduce the audience for nearly all network series. The three major networks 
together attracted only 55% of the prime-time viewers -- about 10 points below 
their average during the official season between September and April. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday's "Cosby" rerun, for example, was seen in about 7 million fewer 
homes than the show averaged for the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
And an original episode of "The Simpsons" during the first week of last month's 
sweeps period actually scored a higher rating than the repeat that aired last 
Sunday but it ranked only 13th that week because the other networks' ratings 
were so much higher. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, "The Simpsons" ranked higher last week because it lost less of 
its regular audience than most other shows. 
</P>
<P>
That was also true for several other of Fox's Sunday-night series. Following 
"The Simpsons," a repeat of "Married . . . With Children" finished 11th for the 
week, and a new episode of "In Living Color" zoomed up to 19th. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Fox soared even higher as these three shows gave KTTV Channel 
11 three of the four top-rated series of the week. 
</P>
<P>
While most analysts believe that "The Simpsons" will make at least a dent in 
NBC's longtime stranglehold on the Thursday-night audience this fall when Fox 
attempts to use it to launch a new night of programming, some have questioned 
the wisdom of breaking up Fox's own Sunday juggernaut. They question whether 
the other series can perform as well without the lead-in of "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
For example, "In Living Color," the caustic and sometimes risque new series 
from Keenan Ivory Wayans, could get crushed when Fox moves it from its cushy 
time period following "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children" to 8 
p.m. on Sundays against ABC's own ratings phenomenon, "America's Funniest Home 
Videos." Though Fox has proven it can compete with the Big Three with a few 
shows in a few time periods, many of the network's programs have floundered. 
Last week, for example, Fox also took credit for five of the six least-watched 
prime-time programs. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the week with a 10.9 rating and 20% share of the audience. ABC was 
second with a 10.2 and 19 share, while CBS trailed with a 8.9 and 16 share. Fox 
averaged a 6.2 rating for its 10 hours of prime-time programming on Monday, 
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. Each rating point represents 921,000 
households. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' telecast of the Tony Awards," honoring Broadway's best, scored a lowly 7.6 
rating and 13 share on Sunday, crushed by "Revealing Evidence," a first-run 
TV-movie on NBC that garnered a 14.5 rating and 24 share. 
</P>
<P>
NBA playoff games -- one between Chicago and Detroit and two others featuring 
Portland against Phoenix -- limped to 40th, 48th and 53rd places respectively. 
</P>
<P>
'CHEERS' ON TOP -- "Cheers," "Roseanne" and "Seinfeld" lead the ratings. The 
full list is on Page 9

Ancient Bulls Found: Iraqi archeologists excavating a palace in the Assyrian 
capital of Nineveh have found seven giant marble bulls, some blue and some 
purple, dating to the 7th Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
The unique finds were located at the eastern entrances to the home of King 
Esarhaddon, who ruled from 681-668 BC. Some of the bulls, three times life size 
and sporting wings, appeared to be in excellent condition. The six-month-old 
dig also revealed rare inscriptions and drawings. Archeologist Madhat Jabur 
said one tablet depicted the legendary Babylonian King Gilgamesh, hero of the 
Epic of Gilgamesh dating from 2000 BC, holding a lion under his right arm and a 
bent sword in his left. GREG BRAXTON

TURNOUT LIGHT AS VOTERS GO TO POLLS IN PRIMARY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AND THE RACES INVOLVING WOMEN CANDIDATES 
ATTRACT NATIONAL ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Californians turned out in light numbers Tuesday for a primary election likely 
to decide the future of the state's legendary "tax revolt." Voters also will 
choose nominees for a new governor and for the first-ever state insurance 
commissioner, and determine whether women will be positioned to make history 
and dramatically expand their profile in state government. 
</P>
<P>
Experts had predicted about 44% of the registered voters would turn out at the 
polls. By late afternoon, state officials said voting in Los Angeles was 
running about the same as in the last gubernatorial primary election, in 1986, 
which produced a record low turnout of 40.45%. 
</P>
<P>
If eligible but unregistered adults are considered, Tuesday's far-reaching 
decisions on taxes, crime, ethics and the historic bid for power by women were 
left in the hands of about one-third of the voting-age population. 
</P>
<P>
In the Democratic and Republican parties, women were in contention for 
nomination for half of the statewide constitutional offices. Leading the charge 
was former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who sought the Democratic 
nomination for governor against Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
California has never elected a woman governor. Also, California has never 
elected a governor in modern times who was not sized up for presidential 
potential. The combination has made Feinstein's campaign a matter of keen 
national interest. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Democratic primary will face two-term Republican U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson, who breezed through Tuesday's primary without serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Women also fielded strong candidates for the offices of lieutenant governor, 
treasurer and secretary of state. Only one woman now holds statewide office, 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
Also of national interest, not to mention local concern, is the fate of a 
proposed doubling of the gasoline tax in the birthplace of the modern tax 
revolt. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Proposition 111 would start the state on a $15-billion-plus 
highway and transit building splurge -- and signal the first real slacking of 
the anti-tax mood since the famous property tax rollback of Proposition 13 in 
1978. Conversely, its defeat would spoil the hopes of politicians of both 
parties who face mounting problems of population growth, decaying services and 
budgetary restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Two ancillary propositions, 108 and 116, would add money to the transportation 
pot for rail services. 
</P>
<P>
Crime victims took the public stage in an emotional and often dramatic campaign 
on behalf of Proposition 115, their measure to rework California's criminal 
procedures. Proponents sought a faster dispensing of justice. Scattered but 
vocal opponents worried that the proposition would be counter-productive and 
cost defendants important safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Political professionals bit their nails all day Tuesday over a series of 
ethics, pay raise and reapportionment votes. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions 118 and 119 would reduce the power of the Democratic majority in 
the Legislature to reapportion California's Senate, Assembly and growing 
congressional delegations. Proposition 112 would impose new ethics restrictions 
on state officials and allow an independent commission to raise lawmaker's 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Proposition H in the city of Los Angeles would impose new ethics 
restrictions on local officials and raise salaries for the mayor and members of 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the governor's race, voters faced a lively lineup of primaries 
for other state offices. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republican state senators from Orange County battled for the nomination for 
lieutenant governor. Marian Bergeson, of Newport Beach, took an anti-abortion 
position against the abortion rights stand of her opponent, John Seymour of 
Anaheim. The winner is to face incumbent Democrat Leo T. McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a Republican man and woman fought for their party's nomination for 
treasurer -- appointed incumbent Tom Hayes against former U.S. Treasurer Angela 
(Bay) Buchanan. On the Democratic side, Kathleen Brown sought her party's 
nomination and the right to carry on her famous family's political legacy: Her 
brother, Edmund G. Brown Jr., and father were elected to statewide offices and 
then elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorneys of Los Angeles, Ira Reiner, and of San Francisco, Arlo 
Smith, waged a wild race for the Democratic nomination for attorney general. On 
the Republican side, former congressman Dan Lungren took his party's nomination 
without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Eu sought nomination to a fifth term, and Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig asked for election to a third. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, two seats on the embattled Board of Supervisors were up 
for election. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1st District seat left vacant by the retirement of veteran Pete 
Schabarum, his former aide Sarah Flores sought to become the first Latino to 
hold the office of supervisor. Other contenders for the San Gabriel Valley seat 
were former congressman Jim Lloyd and Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien, who 
was Schabarum's hand-picked successor. 
</P>
<P>
In the other contest, Supervisor Ed Edelman ran for a fifth four-year term in 
the 3rd District, which includes East Los Angeles, Hollywood, West Los Angeles 
and part of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The results of both, however, are clouded by a federal judge's ruling Monday 
that supervisorial district boundaries discriminate against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In other county races, Sheriff Sherman Block and Assessor John J. Lynch both 
sought reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Voters along the mountainous Malibu coast were voting on whether to become Los 
Angeles County's 87th city. 
</P>
<P>
The incorporation drive was the culmination of a long-running battle between 
area residents and the county Board of Supervisors. Cityhood advocates 
complained that the county has allowed too much development in the chic locale. 
If the 20,000-resident city is approved, voters also chose five new council 
members from among 30 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a race where the city-hopping hankerings of Los Angeles Raiders 
owner Al Davis became a major issue, Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson found himself 
fighting for his political survival against a field of younger opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the attack on the 75-year-old Wilson -- the Bay Area city's first black 
mayor -- were two Democratic "young Turks," Assemblyman Elihu Harris and City 
Councilman Wilson Riles Jr. Both attacked Wilson for his part in a failed, 
$600-million-plus deal to lure the Raiders back to Oakland.

COWBOYS HANGING UP SPURS; 
</P>
<P>
RANCHERS ARE HIRING FOREIGN HANDS WHO WILL PUT UP WITH LOW PAY AND HARD WORK. 
HERDS ARE THINNED AND HELICOPTERS ARE USED IN ROUNDUPS.

<P>
BEAVER, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American cowboy, that lanky, leather-faced, bowlegged archetype of the 
West, is a vanishing breed. 
</P>
<P>
From the Texas Panhandle to Montana's Big Sky country, frustrated cattle 
ranchers say the once-ample supply of savvy, reliable cowhands has plumb dried 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding a good cowpuncher is darn near impossible these days," griped Lynn 
Anderson, a lifelong cattleman with a ranch outside Kingman, Ariz. "There's 
nobody around who's willing to put up with the hard, sweaty work, the 
isolation, the low pay and the dangers of the job." 
</P>
<P>
The decline of the buckaroo amounts to more than a sad historical footnote. The 
labor shortage is redefining life on American ranches, prompting many members 
of the $37-billion cattle industry to thin herds, team up with neighbors and 
alter management practices to stay afloat. On some sprawling spreads in West 
Texas, for instance, ranchers are saving hours of saddle time by using 
helicopters to round up livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Wyoming, the situation is particularly grim -- and a tad embarrassing. 
After all, there are bronco-riding cowboys on every license plate and helmeted 
Cowboys on the University of Wyoming football team. 
</P>
<P>
But dadgummit, the state's ranch owners say, there just ain't any real-life 
cowboys to be found. 
</P>
<P>
In desperation, some cattlemen have begun importing foreign workers to ride the 
range. Under a provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act passed by 
Congress in 1986, ranchers may hire temporary foreign help if they first prove 
that no qualified Americans want the job. 
</P>
<P>
Rory Cross struggled fruitlessly to find local hands to work his Powder Horn 
Ranch in Beaver, a tiny settlement 50 miles south of Casper in the foothills of 
the Medicine Bow Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"They either don't know cattle, don't want to work hard or tend to want to go 
into town and get drunk," lamented Cross, 53, a third generation rancher and 
representative in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated, Cross opted to take advantage of the new law and hired two foreign 
vaqueros -- one from Mexico, another from Peru. The process was tortuous and 
expensive, but worth it, the rancher says. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are great workers," Cross said recently as he watched Cesario 
Celestino Soto, from Lima, Peru, ride in across the rolling grassland after a 
morning of branding. "They're steady and they don't complain when you ask them 
to fix a fence or dig an irrigation trench." 
</P>
<P>
Like Cross, ranchers in Montana, Arizona and Colorado have brought in cowboys 
from south of the border. Cattlemen in Texas, New Mexico and Utah may soon 
follow suit. Before long, some industry experts predict, foreign cowboys may be 
as common a sight on the range as a white-faced Hereford. 
</P>
<P>
"Cowboys have a romantic image, but it takes a lot of dedication, skill and 
desire to do the job, and Americans don't seem to want to make the sacrifices 
the life demands anymore," said Peter Decker, a Colorado rancher and former 
state agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Problem 
</P>
<P>
The roots of the cowboy crunch go back several decades, as higher paying, less 
grueling jobs in the nation's cities drained rural populations. Ranchers 
"scrounged up and shared whatever hands they could find" and began modernizing 
their operations to cut their use of labor, said Byron Price, executive 
director of the Oklahoma City-based National Cowboy Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Still, slicker management could not eliminate the need for manpower, and thus 
many ranchers began filling the gap by hiring Mexican hands. This proved a 
fruitful relationship. With cattle a major commodity in northern Mexico, most 
of the undocumented workers had already mastered the rudiments of the cowboy 
life -- riding, roping and branding. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, however, Congress broke up this friendly arrangement, passing an 
immigration reform package that sought to stem the tide of illegal immigrants 
entering the United States. Suddenly, ranchers -- like other employers who 
knowingly hired undocumented workers -- faced the threat of hefty sanctions by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The law was a big jolt," said Jack Huning, who owns a ranch outside 
Albuquerque. "You started seeing articles in the papers about raids and big 
fines. It made you nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Huning said he "had to let two good (Mexican) cowboys go" because he "just 
couldn't take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Many veteran vaqueros qualified for amnesty under the immigration reform law 
and these men -- like Americans before them -- hung up their lariats and moved 
into more lucrative industries. At the same time, new applicants seemed 
scarcer, perhaps deterred by reports that many outfits were no longer hiring 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers have redoubled labor-saving efforts, such as using helicopters and 
all-terrain cycles for chasing down wayward heifers and for traveling pastures 
on fence-mending missions. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to cut your calving time; you pool resources with other ranches; you 
basically do anything to get by with fewer bodies," said Chandler Keys, a 
spokesman for the National Cattlemen's Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But most cattle raisers still say they are scraping by with smaller crews than 
they need to manage their herds. As Decker put it: "Of the ranchers I know, 
throughout the West, they are all, every day, looking for good workers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guest Workers 
</P>
<P>
Last year, cattlemen for the first time began importing cowboys under a guest 
worker program called H2a. Established in 1952, the program has been used for 
decades by sheep ranchers to import herders from Spain, Peru and, more 
recently, Mongolia. Sugar cane growers in Florida also use the H2a system to 
hire thousands of temporary field workers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, ranchers must first advertise for cowboys and interview all 
interested applicants. If the number of qualified candidates falls short of the 
rancher's needs, the U.S. Department of Labor then certifies that there are 
insufficient American workers to fill the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign cowboys are given visas for a maximum of three years, but their status 
must be renewed annually. The vaqueros' transportation to the ranch is paid by 
the employer, and their wage is determined by the state after a market survey. 
In Wyoming, the pay is $600 a month, in Arizona $650. Workers also receive room 
and board and worker's compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But after hiring the H2a cowboys, ranchers must continue advertising for help 
throughout the first half of the foreign workers' contract. If an American 
cowboy shows up during that period, he must be given a job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real concern for the rancher, because he might have to fire the 
foreign worker or else pay the salaries of two men," said Oralia Mercado, 
executive director of Mountain Plains Agricultural Service, which processes H2a 
applications for 38 ranchers in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign cowboys say the H2a program has been a godsend. Cesario Celestino Soto, 
35, left a wife and three children in Lima. He misses them, but, unable to find 
steady work in Peru, he decided to come to Wyoming after a relative heard there 
was a job on the Cross ranch. He now shares a small red house -- outfitted with 
a rare ranch luxury, a satellite dish -- with another hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The work is not too hard, and I'm liking it," said Celestino, a slight man 
with a broad smile. "It is difficult for my family, but they are happy about 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ranchers' Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Among ranchers, the temporary worker program receives mixed reviews. Many 
complain that the hiring process is too laborious and say the federal 
government responds too sluggishly to their applications, often leaving them 
without help during peak periods like branding or calving season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Republican Rep. Lamar Smith -- whose West Texas district is home to 
some of the nation's largest ranches -- introduced legislation designed to ease 
the H2a process, but the effort failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The regulations are so burdensome, the red tape so long and the delays so 
terrible that it's awfully difficult to find the cowboys you need when you need 
them," said Smith, a cattleman himself. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, only 50 foreign cowhand jobs were approved by the federal government 
-- a tiny fraction of the 26,000 H2a workers employed that year. John Hancock, 
the Department of Labor's chief of agricultural certification, expects the 
number of cowboys to rise as word of the program spreads. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers agree with that assessment because, outside of hiring illegal aliens, 
they have no choice. Fewer and fewer Americans, it seems, are willing -- and 
able -- to lead a life in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
There are, ranchers report, plenty of "TV cowboys" -- people who fancy Western 
wear and Hank Williams songs. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of (applicants) who seem to think being a cowboy means looking at 
some nice scenery -- kind of a dude ranch holiday," New Mexico cattleman Huning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of 15 (American) guys who come looking for a job, 13 of them want to spend 
the day in a bar acting like a cowboy," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, an honest-to-goodness cowpuncher needs more than a drawl and a 
10-gallon hat to measure up. In Arizona, the advertisement seeking cowboys 
demands someone who can "round up, castrate, brand and vaccinate cattle, build 
and repair fences, windmills and irrigation equipment and ride, break and shoe 
horses," said Lisa Bray, who runs a Phoenix-based firm that hires H2a workers 
for ranchers across the state. It helps if you're an amateur mechanic who can 
fix farm machinery. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this season I interviewed 100 (American applicants)," Bray said. "Out of 
that I hired six. The first guy lied, saying he could break horses when he 
couldn't, and he lasted two weeks. Two others didn't show up. A third found a 
better job . . . . So we're left with two, and I'm not holding my breath about 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Theories on the sagging domestic interest in the cowboy life abound. 
Conservatives blame welfare programs or the erosion of a work ethic among 
younger generations. Others suggest the dip in rural populations means there 
are fewer kids growing up with an interest in ranching and cowboy know-how. 
</P>
<P>
Still others say it's simply a matter of economics. Wages and benefits lag 
behind those offered by urban employers and, although many ranchers are 
attempting to provide such incentives as television, most outfits are in 
isolated areas and can't offer amenities to compensate for the low pay. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a modern cowboy must be someone who is not really interested in 
getting ahead. With land, machinery and livestock costs high, ranching is so 
capital-intensive that a cowpuncher earning $900 or less a month has little 
hope of ever striking out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
C. L. Sonnichsen summed up this dilemma in his book, "Cowboys and Cattle Kings: 
Life on the Range Today." A cowhand, Sonnichsen wrote, has "about as much 
chance to become a cattleman as a rustler has of getting to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona rancher Anderson, whose grandfather launched a ranching business after 
building railroads in the 1870s, offers a dose of typical cowboy philosophy 
when asked about the demise of his breed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit sad," Anderson said, "and I regret the loss of it because it's my 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, there's a lot of things more productive than sitting on 
your horse and letting your feet hang down." 
</P>

PROP. 111 IN CLOSE VOTE; ETHICS PLAN WINS EASILY; 
</P>
<P>
BALLOT MEASURES: GOP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PLANS LOSE. STATE BOND PROPOSALS 
WINNING ACCEPTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Torn between dislike of higher taxes and impatience with traffic congestion, 
California voters were narrowly favoring a complex package of proposals that 
would ease government spending restrictions and trigger a 9-cent-per-gallon 
hike in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
With solutions to a state budget crisis riding on the outcome, the fate of 
Proposition 111 remained in doubt. Gov. George Deukmejian was banking that 
passage of the measure would allow him to leave office with a solid plan in 
place for revitalizing California's overburdened transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
As late returns filtered in, Propositions 118 and 119, two Republican-backed 
plans to change the way legislative and congressional districts are drawn every 
10 years, clearly had gone down in defeat, while Proposition 115, a ballot 
measure that would streamline California's criminal justice system was easily 
winning passage. 
</P>
<P>
And in a triumph for lawmakers, voters approved Proposition 112, a ballot 
measure that would impose new ethical standards on state officials but make it 
easier for legislators and elected state officials to win pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the complexity of many of the 17 propositions on the ballot, voters 
appeared to be making careful choices among some proposals. They were showing 
support, for example, for Proposition 121, which would authorize $450 million 
in bonds for higher education. But voters were much more strongly in favor of 
Proposition 123, which would permit an $800 million issue for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
On the transportation front, Proposition 108, a plan for $1 billion in bonds to 
finance mass transit, was a favorite with the voters, but Proposition 116, an 
initiative that authorizes $2 billion in bonds for rail transportation, held a 
small lead. Proposition 108 cannot go into effect without the passage of 
Proposition 111. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee and an author of the gas-tax proposal, cautiously predicted victory 
for Proposition 111. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people recognize that we have to solve the gridlock problems that we 
are facing and I think they understand that periodically you have to make an 
investment in the future," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-tax crusader Ted Costa said he expected the voting to be "awfully close" 
because opponents did not have the financial strength to mount a strong media 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the election evening, jubilant Democrats declared victory in their 
fight to defeat Propositions 118 and 119, which had the potential to change the 
balance of power in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again the voters have indicated they want the Legislature to engage in 
reapportionment," said Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks leading up to the election, the governor's proposal for changes in 
the spending limit and the initiatives on reapportionment were the most visible 
ballot measures as transportation and anti-tax groups attacked each other on 
the gasoline tax and Republicans and Democrats locked horns over the drawing of 
district lines. 
</P>
<P>
Divided by philosophical differences and distracted by internal squabbles, 
anti-tax forces did not emerge as a factor in the gasoline tax debate until 
late in the campaign, when backers of the proposals had already spent millions 
on television advertising, garnered the support of 250 organizations and won 
endorsements from top elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the anti-tax group, however, proved fortuitous. Demanding free 
air time to counter the barrage from the Proposition 111 and 108 forces, 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) and anti-tax activists Tom Rogers 
and Costa persuaded numerous radio stations and a few television stations to 
run low-budget spots attacking the spending limit changes. The counterattack 
hit the airwaves just as the "Yes on Propositions 111 and 108" campaign was 
running out of money and being forced to cancel its final television 
advertising blitz. 
</P>
<P>
With both Democrats and Republicans viewing reapportionment as a high stakes 
battle that would determine their party's future standing in the state power 
structure, Propositions 118 and 119 drew more media spending than any other 
ballot measures. By the week before the election, the two sides together had 
invested more than $6 million in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Teaming up with organized labor, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Roberti spearheaded a Democratic assault against the two 
propositions and enlisted Hollywood personalities Jack Lemmon, James Garner and 
Bea Arthur for a spate of commercials. The poorer-financed opposition responded 
with advertisements that starred actor Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures would change the way district lines are drawn for elections to 
the state Assembly and Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Republicans argued that the change is needed to keep Democrats from drawing 
district lines in a manner deliberately designed to maintain incumbents -- 
particularly Democrats -- in office. Democrats countered that the new process 
would have the effect of reducing the number of women and minorities who hold 
political office. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the task of redrawing district lines is undertaken 
every 10 years by the Legislature with the governor holding veto power over the 
final product. In 1981, Democrats, who held the governor's chair and a majority 
in each legislative house, dominated the process. 
</P>
<P>
While leaving redistricting in the hands of the Legislature, Proposition 118 
involved changing the process by requiring that any plan receive two-thirds 
vote in each house, the governor's signature and the endorsement of state 
voters. Proposition 119, a more drastic measure, would cut the Legislature out 
of the process entirely and transfer its role to an independent 12-member 
commission appointed by a panel of retired appellate court judges. 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the big-money battles waged over the gas tax and 
reapportionment were the proposals to streamline criminal justice procedures 
and impose new ethical standards on legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal justice measure became enmeshed in gubernatorial politics in the 
early months of the campaign when state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a 
Democratic candidate for governor, claimed that a privacy provision would 
jeopardize abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
An irritated U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the honorary chairman of the Proposition 
115 campaign and a Republican candidate for governor, said Van de Kamp was 
trying to create a political issue out of thin air. He said the initiative 
would not limit any civil rights guaranteed under state law because it applied 
to criminal procedures. His argument won support from former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, the other Democratic gubernatorial candidate and a 
backer of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reduce delays in criminal proceedings, the initiative forces 
California to copy more of the federal system. It amends the California 
Constitution to require state courts to follow the generally more restrictive 
federal courts in interpreting a number of rights of criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed in the aftermath of an FBI investigation into state government 
corruption, the ethics measure stops lawmakers from accepting outside speaking 
fees, puts a limit on gifts they can receive and prohibits them from lobbying 
their former colleagues for 12 months after they leave office. 
</P>
<P>
But to sweeten what is to some legislators is an otherwise distasteful measure, 
the proposal also creates a seven-member independent commission and gives it 
authority to grant substantial pay increases to lawmakers, the governor and 
other elected state officials.

AILING WOMAN USES DOCTOR'S SUICIDE DEVICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Alzheimer's patient traveled 2,000 miles to commit suicide with the help of 
a doctor who built a device that gave her a lethal dose of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing Janet Adkins told Dr. Jack Kevorkian on Monday was, "You just 
make my case known." Then, he said, she pressed a button on the contraption 
that released the lethal mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Some medical ethicists Tuesday called the doctor's actions immoral and perhaps 
illegal. A prosecutor said he would wait for autopsy results before deciding 
whether to charge Kevorkian, and will seek an injunction to prevent the doctor 
from using the device again. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian told the Associated Press in a telephone interview late Tuesday that 
it was the first time he had used the device to assist a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The Portland, Ore., woman's husband defended his wife's right to die. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of how long you live, but the quality of life you live, and 
it was her life and her decision and she chose," Ron Adkins told Portland's 
KATU-TV. "She made that decision based upon the fact that the things she loved 
most -- reading, literature, music -- and all that she couldn't do any more." 
</P>
<P>
One of the couple's three sons, Neil, said: "She was in a very good state of 
mind, that's the amazing thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a desperate thing or a depressed situation. She was the one that 
helped us all through it," Neil Adkins told KGW-TV in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian said Mrs. Adkins traveled to Michigan during the weekend to use his 
suicide device. He drove the 54-year-old woman in his van to a park in northern 
Oakland County on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kevorkian, he and one of his relatives attached Adkins to a heart 
monitor, then put an intravenous tube in her arm. 
</P>
<P>
The tube first delivered a saline solution. Kevorkian said Adkins then pressed 
a button that injected thiopental, a coma-inducing drug, followed moments later 
by potassium chloride, which stops the heart within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He said she was unconscious in 25 seconds, and died in five or six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It simulates exactly the judicial executions that we do now with legal 
executions, except with this device the person does it himself by pushing a 
button," Kevorkian told the Detroit News on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor is a retired pathologist and an outspoken advocate of what he calls 
doctor-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"Physicians should not be killers, even in cases where the patient requests it 
and there is a compassionate reason behind the act," said Susan Wolf of the 
Hastings Center for biomedical research in Briarcliff, N.Y. "They take an oath 
to do no harm, and taking a life is doing harm." 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian said in March that he expected to be prosecuted after the first use 
of the drug-injecting device. He also said he would not charge patients and 
that he might use it to take his own life some day. 
</P>
<P>
After Adkins died, Kevorkian notified police. Oakland County prosecutor Richard 
Thompson said he won't decide if he will bring charges against the doctor until 
he gets an autopsy report and state police finish their investigation. The 
police have the device, Thompson added. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian said Adkins came to Michigan with her husband and a friend, both of 
whom stayed at a motel while she died and caught a flight back to Oregon later 
Monday night. In Oregon, providing the means to commit suicide is a felony, but 
Michigan has no law against suicide assisted by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian said the Adkinses contacted him in October after learning about his 
device, and he recommended treatment with an experimental drug at a Seattle 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't work," Ron Adkins said. "It was hard on us, all of us, because we've 
been mourning for an entire year knowing that this was what she had in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The device itself -- an aluminum frame with three suspended bottles and a small 
electric motor -- is not illegal, said Gerald Poisson, assistant Oakland County 
prosecutor. But in certain cases, the person who made it available to the 
suicide victim could be charged with homicide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Baughman of the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office in Detroit said last year 
that helping someone die would not be a crime if the patient injected the 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But two lawyers specializing in medical ethics, after hearing details of the 
Kevorkian case, said his actions were improper. 
</P>
<P>
"What this physician did was way over the line," Wolf said. "It was unethical 
and may well have been illegal." 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Medical Assn., passive euthanasia is ethical, said 
Reinhard Priester of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Passive euthanasia might, for example, involve withholding food from a comatose 
patient believed to have no chance of recovery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Priester said Kevorkian, by arranging a suicide ostensibly with the 
patient's consent, appeared to have participated in active euthanasia -- which 
the AMA has deemed morally inappropriate.

CITYHOOD FOR MALIBU HEADING FOR VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL ELECTIONS: EARLY RETURNS SHOW REDONDO BEACH VOTERS SUPPORTING A NEW PIER. 
A $4.5-MILLION BEVERLY HILLS SCHOOL TAX MEASURE TRAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu, the famed seaside home to celebrities and the super rich, was expected 
to become Los Angeles County's newest city after more than 2 1/2 years of 
battling county officials over future development of the coastal community. 
</P>
<P>
Early returns showed Malibu's incorporation bid winning by a comfortable 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu's apparent victory in its quest for independence means that the 
community will get local control over a slew of civic problems, including 
traffic congestion along Pacific Coast Highway, that have emerged over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the practical benefits, the victory was viewed emotionally by many 
as a referendum against Los Angeles County supervisors' plans for an extensive 
sewer system there and a clincher in the battle over whether Malibu remains a 
semi-rural enclave or becomes a booming resort area like Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great day for Malibu," said Randall Barnett, a 10-year resident who 
gathered with numerous cityhood supporters at a beachside restaurant Tuesday 
night. "If we had lost, I think a lot of people here would be in favor of using 
(Supervisor) Deane Dana for fish bait." 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood issue topped a list of community elections that included Beverly 
Hills' attempt to get voters to approve a $4.5-million school tax and an 
opportunity for Redondo Beach voters to have a say in whether the city's 
shattered pier should be rebuilt. Rebuilding the pier appeared to be winning, 
but the Beverly Hills schools tax, which needed a two-thirds approval, was 
slightly behind in early returns. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, a councilman with a penchant for controversial remarks appeared 
headed for a recall, while Long Beach voters were rejecting a proposal to hire 
75 more police officers with funds from a new property tax. Also in Long Beach, 
preliminary vote counts showed incumbent Ernie Kell leading Councilman Tom 
Clark in a runoff for the mayor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Malibu's residents had hoped to break away from the county's 
control so they could decide local planning, transportation and liability 
issues. Battles with supervisors over growth in Malibu go back nearly 30 years 
and spurred two previous incorporation drives, the last one failing in 1976 by 
less than 100 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty city council candidates fought over five seats in a campaign marked not 
only by political dissension but personality clashes. Two candidates even 
launched anti-cityhood drives, warning that Malibu was headed for financial 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
However, as incorporation appeared more and more certain, most of the council 
candidates put their bickering aside and united behind cityhood, which they saw 
as their best chance to stop the county from installing a regional sewer system 
in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-square-mile city of Malibu will stretch from Topanga Canyon to Leo 
Carrillo State Beach and about one mile inland. It will have a population of 
about 25,000, and about 8,500 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Though county supervisors had tried to delay the election, a judge last month 
sided with cityhood backers. Unless the supervisors succeed in their appeal, 
Malibu will become a city after election results are certified, probably in 
late June or early July. 
</P>
<P>
As Malibu voters were marching to the polls, the supervisors defiantly moved a 
step closer Tuesday to installing their sewer system in the community, which 
currently relies on septic tanks. The supervisors approved using six acres near 
Pepperdine University as the site of a sewer treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills voters, meanwhile, were asked to approve a tax to raise about 
$4.5 million annually for the Beverly Hills Unified School District. Supporters 
of the tax said that the quality of education was at stake. Without it, the 
district planned to sacrifice dozens of teachers and assistants, many 
advanced-placement courses and the high school planetarium. Also on the 
chopping block was a 3% pay raise for teachers for the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, voters were being asked in a series of advisory ballot 
measures whether to rebuild the battered pier -- a landmark that was nearly 
demolished by fire and storms two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1929, the Redondo Beach Pier had become an international tourist 
attraction before a series of storms crashed down on the landmark beginning in 
January, 1988. The following May, a spectacular electrical fire consumed much 
of what was left of the beach structure. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach election was partly overshadowed Tuesday night by former 
Councilman Archie Snow's collapse during an impassioned speech in the council's 
chambers, prompting the panel to adjourn early. Snow, 70, who was recovering 
from a heart attack, was stricken as he threatened to launch a new petition 
drive on police funding. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona voters were deciding by a roughly 2-1 margin Tuesday to recall 
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, the most outspoken member of a new council 
majority elected last year. The city has been embroiled in political turmoil 
ever since, and eight department heads, including the city administrator and 
police chief, have been fired or have resigned during the last 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant called his leading political opponent, Mayor Donna Smith, a "tramp," 
described the Latino city administrator as a "beaner," and labeled the 
president of the Pomona Police Officers Assn. "a psychiatric case" after 
revealing at a public meeting that the officer had been seeing a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 registered voters signed recall petitions accusing Bryant, 70, of 
using his office as a forum for personal attacks. His campaign chairman, Abe 
Tapia, lamented that Bryant "could never get his story out" to voters. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, supporters of the tax measure to pay for another 75 police 
officers said the beefed-up force was needed to combat a marked increase in 
murders, assaults and robberies. However, even Long Beach's police chief was 
pessimistic about the measure's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Long Beach had the largest jump in serious crime of any of 
California's large cities -- 25% between 1988 and 1989, including a 46% 
increase in murders, according to a state report. And crime continues to 
escalate.

GARAMENDI LEADS OVER PRESS FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER: COLLIS RUNS A DISTANT THIRD. BANNISTER OUT FRONT AMONG 
REPUBLICANS. 
</P>

<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) built a small but increasing lead 
over Los Angeles television commentator Bill Press in the race for the 
Democratic nomination for the state's first elected insurance commissioner 
Tuesday night, with Board of Equalization Chairman Conway Collis running a weak 
third. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Huntington Beach insurance agent Wes Bannister held the 
lead. La Habra insurance investigator John L. (Jack) Harden, San Jose attorney 
Tom Skornia and Santa Ana attorney John Parise were battling for second place. 
</P>
<P>
With Democrats much more heavily funded than Republicans and receiving support 
from consumer organizations, it is generally felt that the Democratic nominee 
will go into the November general election a heavy favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, who repudiated past insurance industry support and campaigned on a 
platform of making the insurance companies obey Proposition 103, was winning 
big throughout the northern part of the state, and holding Press to smaller 
leads in Southern California than Garamendi amassed in the north. 
</P>
<P>
It was evident in returns from Los Angeles and Orange counties that Garamendi's 
direct mail campaign by the influential Berman-D'Agostino firm had managed to 
get the Sacramento Valley senator more votes in the metropolitan areas of the 
Southland than he had received before in two statewide races for governor and 
state controller. Garamendi, traveling with his family by van to Sacramento 
late Tuesday said that "things are moving in the right direction" and said he 
was preparing a formal victory statement. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who had major financial support from members of the California Trial 
Lawyers Assn., ran strongest in the areas where television audiences had seen 
his commentaries for years. 
</P>
<P>
Returns in the San Francisco Bay Area showed Garamendi with about a 3-2 lead 
over Press, and Garamendi ran 4 to 1 ahead in the Central Valley. By 
comparison, Press was running ahead about 3 to 2 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Collis had the support of Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield and consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader in a last-minute advertising campaign, but the returns 
showed him well behind everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Press, monitoring the race from a suite at the Biltmore Hotel, said he felt 
"good about the way the campaign was run," but was not hazarding any guesses 
about whether he or Garamendi would emerge as the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Former Common Cause director Walter Zelman was running fourth on the Democratic 
side, San Francisco attorney Ray Bourhis fifth, Temecula insurance man Larry 
Murphy sixth, and Alhambra City Councilman Michael Blanco seventh and last. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, behind Bannister, Harden, Skornia and Parise, Pasadena 
claims consultant Joseph Dunlop was running fifth and last. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103, passed in 1988, made the insurance commissioner's post an 
elective position this year. The primaries drew a large number of candidates to 
what was perceived as a job whose occupant could become a consumer champion. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, all the principal candidates on the Democratic side said they 
would refuse insurers' contributions. Although four of the five Republican 
candidates had an insurance industry background, the insurers did not give them 
much money either, after surveys showed that industry backing would be the kiss 
of death with the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of insurance industry money meant that fund-raising opportunities for 
most of the contestants were limited. Another major lobby in the insurance 
field, trial lawyers, did give a considerable amount to Press, but little to 
other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that two of the three best-funded campaigns, those of Garamendi 
and Collis, relied largely on loans the candidates made to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The main issue in the race appeared to be which candidate could do the most 
effective job of enforcing Proposition 103 and bringing about other reforms of 
insurance practices in the state, including bringing about lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates varied in their prescriptions. Some vowed to crack down on 
fraud, several Republicans and two Democrats advocated no-fault insurance, and 
many said they would audit company accounts to uncover hidden profits. Collis, 
saying he would "break the backs" of the insurance companies, threatened to 
jail their executives if they did not obey Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
No-fault insurance lost a key adherent during the campaign when Garamendi said 
he no longer thought it would be a good idea for California. But Zelman said 
that under limited circumstances he would favor it. 
</P>
<P>
Press and Zelman favored a program of state health insurance for all, while 
almost all the other major party candidates said they favor some government 
role. Gradually, as the campaign wore on, health insurance seemed to become a 
bigger topic of debate and auto insurance a slightly lesser one. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, specifics were lacking in terms of what candidates would do as 
commissioner. In his advertising campaign, Garamendi said he would make 
companies obey Proposition 103 without saying how. Such generalities were 
usually the rule.

VALIDITY OF 1ST DISTRICT VOTE IN DOUBT AFTER RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR and MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Roberto Aguilar, a 70-year-old retired meat packer from South El Monte, was 
vaguely aware Tuesday of a federal court decision that placed in doubt the 
validity of two Los Angeles County supervisor contests. He wasn't sure of the 
details, but it really didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar had come to vote for a Latina for supervisor, and he wasn't going to be 
deterred. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard something about (a ruling)," Aguilar said. "But I don't pay much 
attention to that stuff. I vote what I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said it was not hard deciding to vote for Sarah Flores, a former aide 
to retiring 1st District Supervisor Pete Schabarum: "She's Latina. That was 
good enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
There was no universal reaction among county voters Tuesday to the election-eve 
bombshell dropped by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon. He ruled on Monday 
that the board had intentionally discriminated against Latinos when it redrew 
district boundaries in 1981. The ruling opened the possibility that new 
supervisorial elections may be called soon and that the results of Tuesday's 
vote in the 1st District and in Supervisor Ed Edelman's 3rd District might be 
invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
Only about a third of the county's registered voters showed up to vote. In 
interviews, many of those who voted said they had not heard about the ruling. 
Others, like Aguilar, had heard sketchy radio reports about the decision, but 
were confused about its meaning. Some were ambivalent; others were angry. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it a legal election or is it not legal?" asked Ernestina Corrales, a 
56-year-old housewife who cast her ballot in the predominantly Latino community 
of Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Latino voters in the vast 1st Supervisorial District -- which 
encompasses much of the San Gabriel Valley -- Corrales greeted news of the 
decision with ambivalence. She said she supported the court's findings but 
planned to vote in the supervisor's race, even though the court had said the 
election might be voided. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought (discrimination) was wrong, but I didn't think we could 
ever be able to do anything about it," Corrales said. "But lo and behold, we 
did. It's a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Flores was considered to be among the strongest contenders in the 1st District 
-- she had raised more money than any of her nine opponents and early returns 
showed her leading the large field. Many Latino voters in the district -- which 
is about 47% Latino -- said they planned to vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
Some non-Latino residents of the district said they disagreed with the court 
decision. Tom Alex, 52, operations manager of a leasing company, cast his vote 
in an upscale Glendora neighborhood. He said the judge's decision was "off 
base." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should expand the number of seats, but not draw the lines for 
ethnic or racial reason," Alex said. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Lynberg, campaign coordinator for Flores, said campaign workers had 
little trouble getting voters to the polls. She said that publicity surrounding 
the decision may, in fact, have increased interest in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Other voters, however, said they felt cheated by the court's ruling and would 
not cast ballots in the supervisor's race.

LASIX DEBATE STEALS BELMONT SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: NEW YORK PROHIBITS USE OF THE DIURETIC TO TREAT HORSES, IN EFFECT 
KEEPING BLEEDERS SUCH AS SUMMER SQUALL AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ELMONT, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day Summer Squall won the Preakness at Pimlico, the 3-year-old colt was 
injected with 10 cubic centimeters of Lasix, twice the legal dosage that horses 
with pulmonary bleeding can receive on race day in California and most other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is one of eight states that do not limit the amount of Lasix horses 
who have suffered from respiratory bleeding can be given. Three other states 
have a limit higher than five cubic centimeters, the amount recommended by 
Racing Commissioners International, a group of state racing officials from the 
United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of 32 American racing jurisdictions, including California, adhere to 
the five-cubic-centimeter limit on Lasix, a diuretic that is used to treat 
horses who bleed from the lungs because of exercise-induced stress. 
</P>
<P>
The differences in dosage are merely a small part of the Lasix issue. New York 
doesn't allow horses to race on the drug, or any other, for that matter, while 
the rest of the country does. 
</P>
<P>
The Lasix issue has clouded the 122nd running of the Belmont Stakes Saturday. 
The handicappers' problem is what to do with Unbridled. The Kentucky Derby 
winner and second-place finisher in the Preakness will be heavily favored in 
the final Triple Crown race, even though he won't run on Lasix for the first 
time since he hemorrhaged after a race late last year at Calder in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on Lasix is keeping Summer Squall out of the Belmont, depriving New 
York racing fans of a showdown between the colts who won the first two races in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
To the credit of the managers of Unbridled and Summer Squall, they announced 
their Belmont plans before the Preakness was run and have honored them. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall's owners -- a 28-member syndicate that is run by Cot Campbell of 
Dogwood Stable -- are passing up the chance to win a first-place purse of more 
than $400,000, plus a $1-million bonus that goes to the horse who runs in all 
three Triple Crown races and accumulates the most points on a 5-3-1 basis for 
finishing first, second or third. Summer Squall is tied at eight points with 
Unbridled, who needs only to finish the Belmont to win the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say this year's Belmont evokes memories of macabre interest, of 
Demons Begone, the 1987 Kentucky Derby favorite who bled profusely from the 
nostrils after the first half-mile of that race and was unable to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled apparently has not bled since the Calder incident. Summer Squall, on 
the other hand, has bled after at least three morning exercises this year, most 
recently the day before the Preakness, when he showed a trickle of blood from 
the nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of what happened the day before the race, the reputation of all of 
racing was on the line in the Preakness," said trainer Wayne Lukas, who 
believes that Lasix serves a purpose in treating horses. "If Summer Squall had 
bled in the race and run badly, the whole industry would have been put in the 
position of trying to defend what we do to our horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the same in the Belmont. Apparently Unbridled's condition 
has been under control since he was a 2-year-old and his trainer (Carl Nafzger) 
will be trying through natural means to make sure he doesn't bleed on 
Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger is going to dehydrate Unbridled, gradually taking food and water away 
from the horse in the 24 hours before the race. Unbridled will also ingest a 
potassium powder, which is intended to keep his muscle tone high. 
</P>
<P>
"Lasix would be easier, of course," Nafzger said. "The horse has actually 
gained weight since he ran in the Derby. If he didn't, I would think twice 
about running the Belmont." 
</P>
<P>
Will the dehydration work, keeping Unbridled from bleeding but not weakening 
him enough to hurt his chances? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is 100% in this world," Nafzger said. "I've done this with horses 
before, and had some of them run good, and some of them not run one more step." 
</P>
<P>
Some trainers doubt Nafzger's plan will work. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any success trying to do what Nafzger's doing," said Nick Zito, 
trainer who conditions Belmont entrant Thirty Six Red. "I've played sports, and 
horses aren't any different than human athletes. When you play sports, your 
system needs water." 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba, who was trying to sweep the Triple Crown in 1987, and Tank's 
Prospect, who won the Preakness in 1985, are two Lasix horses who ran poorly in 
the Belmont, although neither bled. Alysheba was the victim of a tentative ride 
by Chris McCarron, and Tank's Prospect, who had respiratory problems rather 
than being a bleeder, went lame. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas often will ship his bleeders out of New York, many of them coming to 
California where they can be treated with Lasix. With rich owners and hundreds 
of horses in his far-flung operation, Lukas can do what isn't economically 
feasible for other trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, Lukas will run a bleeder in New York without Lasix and 
take his chances. Last month, for instance, Lukas ran Criminal Type, who ran on 
Lasix while winning the Pimlico Special two weeks earlier, in the Metropolitan 
Handicap at Belmont. Criminal Type upset co-favorites Easy Goer and 
Housebuster. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of bleeders from other states is not identified, either in the 
track programs or in the Daily Racing Form, when the horses run in New York. 
Unbridled's condition will be familiar to most horseplayers Saturday, but what 
about horses running in minor races, or the dozens of horses who will run in 
the seven Breeders' Cup races at Belmont Park in October? 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, the New York racing Establishment remains 
intransigent. Its position on Lasix was fortified by a recent University of 
Pennsylvania study, commissioned by the New York Jockey Club, which showed that 
the diuretic doesn't necessarily stop bleeding, but sometimes improves the 
speed of horses. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the study was predictable. Horsemen in favor of Lasix said that the 
sample of horses was small and that they all ran at a track, Philadelphia Park, 
that generally runs cheap horses. 
</P>
<P>
"The study has scientific credibility," said Tony Chamblin, executive vice 
president of Racing Commissioners International. "But I think the jury is still 
out on the results, because only 79 horses were used and that makes the study 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised, though, that Lasix was found not to stop bleeding in 52% of 
the horses used. But there's something wrong about the number of horses that 
are running on Lasix in this country. The number is about 70%. I find that to 
be absurd, or, at the very least, bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Chamblin doesn't believe racing will ever be unified on the Lasix issue, mainly 
because of the economic needs of tracks caught up in year-round racing 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Tanenbaum, an official at Gulfstream Park: "If Lasix were banned, the 
big tracks would survive, the middle-of-the-road tracks would struggle because 
of a lack of horses, and the little tracks would go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
R. Richards Rolapp, president of the American Horse Council, is still hoping 
for uniformity on the Lasix question. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Jockey Club survey has been constructive," Rolapp told the Daily 
Racing Form this week. "I think we can get there (uniformity). 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in racing believe it's impossible, that the states are going 
to go their own way, but I think that if you could come up with the facts and 
relate them to what is reasonable and enforceable policy, you can have a 
regulatory scheme that is uniform and that everyone can live with. A lot of the 
publicity we have witnessed recently is unfortunate. We need to get 'drugs in 
race horses' out of the news. It can be done." 
</P>
<P>
In California, there is such a strong lobby by the horsemen that it doesn't 
seem likely that Lasix will ever be abandoned. One of these horsemen is Bill 
Shoemaker, who rode five Belmont winners and a record 8,833 winners before he 
retired to take up training early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When they say Lasix 'moves up' horses, I think this is deceptive," Shoemaker 
said. "It's not like it's a hop or something. If you've got a bleeder, Lasix 
makes him more comfortable to run. That's the way it might move him up." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jock Jocoy, the state veterinarian at Del Mar, Lasix was 
introduced to California racing in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"(Trainer) Arnold Winick brought it here from Florida," Jocoy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bleeders had been treated in a variety of ways before then, but Winick thought 
Lasix was even better. It made horses feel good, and it made dull horses run 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Other trainers started using Lasix, and finally the state legalized it, even 
though some veterinarians cautioned that the medication was capable of masking 
illegal drugs in postrace testing. "Lasix has a place, it's just another tool a 
trainer will use," Jocoy said. "But like with anything else, trainers can also 
manipulate horses by using it and then not using it on them." 
</P>
<P>
Jocoy estimates that $2 million a year is spent treating bleeders at Santa 
Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar. A five-cc injection of Lasix can cost $20 to 
$35, depending on the veterinarian, and the going rate is $75 for an internal 
endoscopy of a horse to check for bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
For the Preakness, not only did Summer Squall receive a dosage of Lasix that 
was twice the size of the legal limit in California, but he also received two 
injections, one in a vein and the other in a muscle. It is illegal for a 
veterinarian to give a horse Lasix in the muscle in California. 
</P>
<P>
"When a horse gets Lasix intravenously, it really smacks home," Jocoy said. "A 
shot to the muscle is like a reservoir -- it's used as insurance. It dribbles 
into the system, instead of going straight in. The problem with this type of 
injection is that it would affect the testing of a horse." 
</P>
<P>
Cot Campbell made the unintentional pun of the year shortly after Summer Squall 
won the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to bleed a little bit to win a race like this," Campbell said, and 
then caught himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Not literally," Campbell said. "What I meant to say is that you've got to 
sweat a little bit to win a race like this."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

Fred Claire's phone rang off the hook last winter. Everyone wanted Ramon 
Martinez. It took the Dodger general manager about two seconds to answer each 
call. Thanks, but no thanks. . . . "The two people on our current roster we 
absolutely were not going to move were Ramon and Tim Belcher," Claire said the 
morning after Martinez struck out 18 Atlanta Braves and joined Sandy Koufax in 
the Dodger record book. "Our future is with young players. We're never going to 
gain back our consistency by trading away the Martinezes, the Belchers and the 
Jose Offermans." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Offerman is the latest phenom from San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican 
Republic, a 21-year-old shortstop who is tearing up the Pacific Coast League at 
Albuquerque. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Dodgers traded away a young pitching prospect, it was a 
mistake. Sid Fernandez, then 21, went to the New York Mets for Carlos Diaz and 
Bob Bailor on Dec. 12, 1983. No wonder Claire wouldn't even let the 
Philadelphia Phillies get around to mentioning the 22-year-old Martinez's name 
in talks involving Lenny Dykstra. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Would Claire deal Martinez, who has a 6-3 record, for Dykstra, who is batting 
.400-plus, today? "I wouldn't trade Martinez, period," Claire said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Martinez had four chances to at least tie the National League strikeout record 
Monday night -- and the Dodger Stadium crowd groaned every time he got an out 
without a K. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vin Scully wondered aloud if a Dodger fielder might be tempted not to go all 
out to catch a foul ball with Martinez aiming for records and the team ahead, 
6-0. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This might be the first year since 1982 that the city of New York doesn't have 
a title contender. What a shame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott's 7-year-old son, Thomas, served as bat boy for the Cincinnati Reds 
during their series at Dodger Stadium. Byron's buddy Eric Davis wanted Thomas 
to accompany the team to San Francisco after he brought the Reds so much good

MELVIN DURSLAG: TENNIS HAS SEEN IT BEFORE -- FROM WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melvin Durslag 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Pierre Baseline, your widely known authority on tennis fashion, we address 
the subject today of Andre Agassi in Paris and the skirmish in which he is 
engaged with tournament officials. 
</P>
<P>
It is the general consensus there that Andre is not dressing in a style 
befitting the French Open. Under shabby black shorts, he has been wearing hot 
lava tights. His hair is unkempt and he usually needs a shave. 
</P>
<P>
Folks at the French Open haven't yet decided how to describe Agassi, but while 
they are making up their minds, they would tell you he looks like a bum. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he does, the question is raised by Andre whether this is germane to 
playing tennis. Is it an athletic contest they are running, or are they showing 
the spring collection? 
</P>
<P>
Agassi isn't the first to challenge tennis propriety. Women have been doing it 
for decades, dating all the way back to Suzanne Lenglen in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
A daring French type, Suzanne was the first woman in big-time tennis to bare a 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, women players didn't wear bras. They bound themselves with 
material. Refusing to wear anything under her blouse, Suzanne raced for a ball 
one day -- and out popped one of her upper parts. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis was ready to drop dead. 
</P>
<P>
Then along comes Gussie Moran at Wimbledon, where a famed tennis couturier, Ted 
Tinling, designs for her some underpants trimmed in Belgique lace. It's as if 
someone sticks a finger in Wimbledon's tea. Shocked officials allow Gussie to 
stay in the tournament, but her pants are kicked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you decide to wear them?" we once asked Gussie. 
</P>
<P>
She shrugged. "It was a free pair of pants," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you know the gods would be offended?" 
</P>
<P>
"A woman's pants," she replied, "are her own business." 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is 1949. Those involved today in the feminist movement are 
reminded they didn't invent it. 
</P>
<P>
Well, a striking figure named Karol Fageros, tall, blonde, richly tanned, would 
then one-up Gussie. Karol appeared on the court in underpants of dazzling gold 
lame, soon to win her the billing of "Golden Goddess of Tennis." 
</P>
<P>
A signorina from Italy would follow with underpants trimmed in mink, a 
Brazilian would sport panties of bright cerise and an American would display 
sequins. 
</P>
<P>
For tennis, it was a spreading brush fire. The game didn't know which blaze to 
extinguish next. 
</P>
<P>
At West Side Tennis Club of Long Island, a seat of pomposity, a rule was 
instituted forbidding spaghetti straps, halter necklines and hip huggers. And 
if anyone developed the notion he or she could bare a navel, West Side reminded 
the peasant it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over tournament attire then would generally vanish, reappearing five 
years ago at Wimbledon when a woman named Anne White turned up in a jogging 
suit, which she would peel off, revealing a white body stocking. 
</P>
<P>
Anne rose 5 feet 10 1/2 inches. However you cared to describe her construction, 
she was put together. Jaws of those viewing her in the body stocking dropped. 
</P>
<P>
At Wimbledon headquarters, the alarm sounded, as if someone were trying a 
break-in. Anne thought they were going to call Scotland Yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was led to the office like a naughty little girl," she recalled. "The 
director told me, 'I must ask you not to wear that frock.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nor was her cause helped by her opponent, Pam Shriver, expressing disgust at 
such a broach of Wimbledon etiquette. White wanted to slug her. But afraid of 
being defaulted for improper dress, she abandoned the body stocking. 
</P>
<P>
So what kind of case do you make for Agassi, romping about in his hot lava 
tights, upsetting the chief of the French Tennis Federation, Monsieur Philippe 
Chatrier? 
</P>
<P>
A Parisian, appearing in threads bearing the unmistakable stamp of custom 
tailoring, Chatrier is an old tennis promoter who began working audiences about 
the time Jack Kramer did. Does Chatrier have a bona fide beef against Andre? 
</P>
<P>
It can be said in the Frenchman's behalf that other sports embrace dress codes 
-- football, baseball, basketball, hockey. Golfers are impeccable, mainly 
because they are selling the stuff they wear. 
</P>
<P>
To uplift their profession, once likened to pool, bowlers set forth a rigid 
code of dress, calling for "neat hair, neat shirt, neat pants -- no jeans." 
</P>
<P>
We ask the head of the PBA whether a guy is allowed to cuss if he rolls a 7-10 
split. 
</P>
<P>
"Only to himself," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
In cricket, you are asked to wear white, and hot lava pants are not permitted 
in soccer, much less polo. 
</P>
<P>
Do French tennis officials have the right to ask Andre to tidy up, or are his 
pants his own business, as they were Gussie's? 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins this argument is no affair of ours. We just don't want the kid to 
misinterpret looking like a vagrant for looking cool.

RAMS ALLOW RAIDERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRENSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, who have long avoided trades involving their cross-town rivals, have 
granted the Raiders permission to negotiate with tailback Greg Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Bell's agent, Steve Feldman, said he spoke with Raider owner Al Davis Tuesday 
and that they are close to working out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gained 2,349 yards and scored 33 touchdowns the last two seasons, 
the Rams balked when Bell, 27, asked to renegotiate his 1990 contract of 
$475,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, who dealt Eric Dickerson to Indianapolis in 1987 rather than 
renegotiate, countered by signing free-agent tailback Curt Warner in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' asking price is reportedly a middle-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
"All Greg Bell wants is to be paid market value," Feldman said. "We don't 
foresee the Raiders having any problem paying market value. . . . They are 
extremely aware of his statistics."

NEWSWIRE: RED SOX MANAGER SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Joe Morgan of the Boston Red Sox was suspended Tuesday for three games 
by American League President Bobby Brown for supporting a brush-back pitch that 
led to a bench-clearing brawl last weekend in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension is to begin tonight with Boston's game against the New York 
Yankees at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said that he will not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Appeal? Appeal for what? You lose appeals," Morgan said after Boston beat the 
Yankees, 9-8, Tuesday night. "I talked to Mr. Brown. I told him I did not like 
his decision and I have no further comment." 
</P>
<P>
Problems began last Saturday when Indian reliever Doug Jones threw a pitch near 
the head of Tony Pena, who had helped Boston beat Cleveland the previous night. 
On Sunday, Roger Clemens hit the Indians' lead-off batter, Stanley Jefferson, 
triggering a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it. We got even, didn't we?" Morgan said after Boston's victory 
Sunday. "We voted as a team, 34-0, that it would be such." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was unhappy with Morgan's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that pitchers throw close to hitters and sometimes deliberately hit 
them is a known fact," his statement said. "Nevertheless, it behooves the 
American League office to eliminate premeditated and announced violence."

Six players from USC and players from several other local colleges have been 
selected in the first 10 rounds of the baseball draft that began Monday and 
concludes today. 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball released only the names of first-round selections Monday, 
but it has been learned that the Angels, who did not have a first-round choice 
because of the free-agent signing of Mark Langston, took 6-foot-5 right-hander 
Phil Leftwich of Radford (Va.) 
</P>
<P>
University in the second round with the 64th choice overall. Leftwich was 6-6 
with a 3.35 earned-run average this season. 
</P>
<P>
USC infielder Bret Boone was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the fifth 
round and Trojan outfielder John Jackson was chosen by the San Francisco Giants 
in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also took USC pitcher Randy Powers in the seventh round and Trojan 
catcher Danny Gil in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners took USC left-hander John Cummings in the eighth round and Trojan 
second baseman Damon Buford was taken by the Baltimore Orioles in the 10th 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine shortstop Chris Martin was a second-round pick of the Montreal Expos 
and outfielder Jalal Leach was a seventh-round selection of the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford pitcher Mike Mussina was a No. 1 pick of the Baltimore Orioles, the 
20th choice overall, and pitcher Stan Spencer was taken by the Expos with the 
35th choice as compensation for the loss of Hubie Brooks, who signed as a free 
agent with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Marlins, an independent Class-A team in the Florida State League that 
is allowed to take part in the draft beginning in the fourth round, selected 
Stanford outfielder Paul Carey with their first pick. The Marlins took Loyola 
catcher Miah Bradbury in the fifth round and UC Irvine pitcher Ken Whitworth in 
the 10th round.

Coach Mark Marquess gave the ball to John Reid, who knew what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, Stanford's No. 3 pitcher, got the nod instead of ace Stan Spencer and 
kept the top-ranked Cardinal alive in the College World Series Tuesday with a 
6-1 elimination victory over Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, this was the biggest game in my life," Reid said after giving up 
nine hits in eight innings. "I was just glad to get the call. I knew I could do 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (58-11) will play unbeaten Georgia (50-18), already a 16-2 winner over 
the Cardinal, today. Stanford has to win to force a second semifinal on Friday. 
A victory by Georgia would put the Bulldogs in Saturday's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Reid (8-1) worked out of jams in the seventh and eighth innings before Scott 
Weiss finished off Mississippi State (50-21) with a perfect ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs loaded the bases with one out in the seventh on singles by Tommy 
Raffo and Tracy Echols, and a walk to Jim Robinson. But Reid got Rex Buckner to 
ground into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State put runners on first and third with two out in the eighth, 
but Reid again escaped unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate to get the double-play ball because the pitch wasn't good," 
Reid said. "But that was the case all day. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to hit the ball right at us, and I have to give credit to our 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Troy Paulsen drove in three runs for Stanford, and leadoff hitter Jeff Hammonds 
had three hits and scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were swinging the bats a little better today and had a good pitching 
performance," Paulsen said. "We had a solid game all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State Coach Ron Polk saw it as a game of missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what we had to do, just score some runs to win it," Polk said. "There 
were a lot of double plays and a lot of guys left on base." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford broke open a 2-1 game with three runs in the seventh off Bobby Reed. 
Tim Griffin walked and went to third on Troy Tallman's single. Hammonds 
grounded to third, but after Burke Masters looked Griffin back to the bag, he 
threw the ball away trying to get Tallman at second. Griffin scored and Tallman 
took third, from where he scored on a sacrifice fly by Paulsen. 
</P>
<P>
David McCarty followed with a double down the left-field line to score Hammonds 
and chase Reed (15-4) from the game. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State 6, The Citadel 1 -- The Tigers broke out of a batting slump 
with two three-run innings and eliminated the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
LSU advances to Thursday's semifinal against third-seeded Oklahoma State 
(55-16), which beat the Tigers, 7-1, Monday. An LSU victory would force a 
second semifinal Friday; an Oklahoma State victory will put the Cowboys in 
Saturday's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who got only two hits against Oklahoma State Monday, entered the 
series with the highest team batting average, .331. 
</P>
<P>
LSU didn't get a hit against starter Billy Baker until the fourth inning. Then 
the Tigers broke out with four hits and three runs in the fifth, and Tim Clark 
hit a two-run homer to cap a three-run eighth.

McGwire hit two-run homers in the first and third innings, and added a 
sacrifice fly in the ninth. He matched his career high for RBIs and had his 
14th multiple-home run game, four this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball carries well here," McGwire said. "It was carrying exceptionally well 
tonight. This is a good hitter's ballpark. It's hard to explain why I've hit so 
many homers here. I made two good swings and the two balls just jumped out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson also homered for Oakland. Ruben Sierra and Harold Baines homered 
for Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Welch (8-2) gave up four runs on seven hits in seven innings. He walked none 
and struck out five. Dennis Eckersley pitched a scoreless ninth for his 17th 
save in as many chances. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire hit a 376-foot homer with two out in the first off rookie Brian Bohanon 
(0-3). McGwire's 430-foot drive in the third against Bohanon put the Athletics 
ahead, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 10, Chicago 6 -- Jay Buhner hit a three-run double and Henry Cotto had 
an RBI triple and two-run single as the Mariners scored seven times in the 
fifth inning and beat the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman (7-3) won his fourth consecutive start despite giving up six runs, 
four earned, on nine hits in five-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Reynolds walked to start the Mariners' fifth and Cotto tripled for a 4-1 
lead, chasing Greg Hibbard (4-4). Ken Patterson walked Alvin Davis, Jeffrey 
Leonard hit an RBI single and Ken Griffey Jr. walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Buhner doubled and two more walks reloaded the bases. Cotto hit 
a two-out, two-run single to make the score 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 9, New York 8 -- Wade Boggs tripled and scored on Jody Reed's suicide 
squeeze in the eighth inning at Boston as the Red Sox sent the Yankees to their 
ninth loss in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees trailed, 5-1, after one inning, but made the score 8-8 with four 
runs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, knocked down by a pitch from Eric Plunk (2-2), got up and tripled to 
right. Reed bunted to the left of the mound and Boggs scored as Plunk's throw 
glanced off catcher Rick Cerone's glove. Reed was credited with an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 6, Baltimore 4 -- Jaime Navarro gave up two hits through six innings 
in his second start since returning from the minors and B.J. Surhoff homered as 
the Brewers beat the Orioles at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro (2-1), who was sent to the minors last month after struggling early in 
the season, was recalled only because of injuries to the Brewers' staff. He 
walked four in the third to give the Orioles a 1-0 lead, but gave up only two 
singles in his 98-pitch stint. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Crim went 1 2/3 innings for his fourth save. Jay Tibbs (2-6) took the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' Mickey Tettleton hit a three-run homer in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Surhoff hit his fourth homer with one out in the sixth off reliever Kevin 
Hickey, giving Milwaukee a 3-1 lead. Darryl Hamilton doubled and scored on 
Billy Spiers' triple. Brian Holton replaced Hickey and threw Mike Felder's slow 
roller into right field, allowing another run to score. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Minnesota 3 -- Tony Fernandez tripled twice and drove in three runs 
and Fred McGriff homered as the Blue Jays beat the Twins at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who leads the majors with six triples, got three hits and scored 
twice. He is nine for 14 with three triples since moving from leadoff to No. 2 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
David Wells (3-1), who replaced John Cerutti in the starting rotation on May 
21, gave up three runs on four hits, including homers by Gary Gaetti and Shane 
Mack, in seven innings. He struck out a career-high nine and walked five. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Cleveland 2 -- Alan Trammell drove in two runs and Cecil Fielder and 
Lloyd Moseby each got two hits as the Tigers hit 10 singles at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Petry (5-2) gave up two unearned runs, walked four and struck out four in 
five-plus innings, reducing his ERA to 2.51. Edwin Nunez pitched four scoreless 
innings for his first save.

O'MALLEY FINALLY GETS CHANCE; METS WIN ON HOMER IN 11TH, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom O'Malley was starting to think he might not have a chance to win games for 
the New York Mets this season. 
</P>
<P>
With only two hits in 22 at-bats, O'Malley was afraid his game-winning hits 
might be for the Tidewater Tides, a Met farm club. But O'Malley led off the 
11th inning with a home run over the center-field fence to give the Mets a 6-5 
victory over the Montreal Expos Tuesday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley will be sticking around. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended New York's three-game losing streak and left the Mets 2-4 
since Bud Harrelson took over as manager for Dave Johnson last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough adjustment for me to make," O'Malley said. "I was used to 
playing almost every day (at Tidewater), and this is not an easy role to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not tough to accept the role, but it's tough to do what is expected of 
you. I just hope they are patient and like what they see." 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley entered the game in the 10th inning to play first base and hit his 
first homer of the season off reliever Dale Mohorcic (0-1). It was only 
O'Malley's 11th career homer in 1,115 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
John Franco (2-0) pitched one inning for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, Cincinnati 1 -- Scott Garrelts ended a season-long slump by 
outpitching NL earned-run average leader Jack Armstrong at San Francisco as the 
the Reds suffered a second consecutive loss for only the third time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong (8-2) failed in his attempt to become the league's first nine-game 
winner even though he held the Giants to three runs and four hits in 6 2/3 
innings. His ERA rose to 1.77. 
</P>
<P>
Garrelts (2-6), the NL's ERA leader last season, had an 0-3 record with a 9.33 
ERA over his four starts before holding the Reds to four hits in seven innings. 
Jeff Brantley pitched the final two innings to earn his seventh save, despite 
yielding a run-scoring single to Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 5 -- The Pirates turned two high-choppers and a walk into 
the winning run in the ninth inning, giving rookie Stan Belinda his first major 
league victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla hit a three-run homer in the first as the Pirates won for the 
eighth time in 11 games. The Cubs lost for the 10th time in 13 games despite 
getting five hitless relief innings of relief from Steve Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
With the Pirates trailing, 5-4, Cub relief pitcher Mitch Williams (0-5) 
replaced Wilson after R.J. Reynolds' leadoff single in the eighth. Reynolds 
advanced on Bonilla's walk and Jeff King's sacrifice ahead of Andy Van Slyke's 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Wally Backman walked to start the ninth and Gary Redus hit a 
grounder that bounced over third baseman Domingo Ramos' head for a double. With 
the infield playing in, Backman scored standing up as Reynolds hit a 
high-bouncing grounder to second. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 9, St. Louis 6 -- Len Dykstra tied the score with a two-run single 
and Von Hayes put the Phillies ahead with another two-run single to cap a 
four-run eighth inning that beat the Cardinals at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, the major leagues' leading hitter with a .415 average, tied the score, 
5-5, with with a single off Ken Dayley with one out. Dykstra advanced to second 
on a groundout and Hayes followed with a single for the game-winner as the 
Phillies won for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra went two for six to extend his hitting streak to 18 games, the best in 
the major leagues this season, although his average dipped three points. 
Dykstra is hitting .454 (35 for 77) during the streak and is 13 for 23 in his 
last five games. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 11, Houston 2 -- Dennis Rasmussen pitched a four-hitter and Shawn 
Abner and Garry Templeton hit consecutive homers in a six-run fifth inning at 
San Diego as the Padres handed the Astros their fifth consecutive loss.

LIBERIAN REBELS SEIZE RUBBER PLANTATION

MONROVIA, Liberia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebel forces seized the headquarters of the world's largest rubber plantation 
on Tuesday, then gathered outside the adjoining gates of Liberia's 
international airport, plantation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
President Samuel K. Doe pursued a last-stand attempt at peaceful negotiations 
to end a six-month insurgency that has evolved into an ethnic war. He met with 
Christian church officials and Muslim leaders who have offered to act as 
intermediaries. 
</P>
<P>
In Akron, Ohio, a spokesman for the Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. company that 
runs the 120,000-acre plantation referred to the guerrillas as "freedom 
fighters." He said the company wants to keep the plantation operating -- even 
with rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Insurgents now control every major industrial concern in this West African 
country of 2.5 million residents, except possibly the Bong iron ore mine, cut 
off for days from Monrovia and believed behind rebel lines. 
</P>
<P>
Plantation residents said that rebels fired mortars and automatic weapons 
Tuesday as dozens crossed the Farmington River -- the last natural barrier 
before Monrovia -- and moved onto the plantation. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, residents of Harbel, the plantation's company town, told the 
Associated Press there were reports the rebels had killed two Mandingo 
civilians. The report could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Many diplomats and military observers doubt that Doe's army, plagued by 
desertions, bad leadership and poor morale, remains an effective fighting 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Charles M. Taylor, a dissident businessman whose forces invaded 
the country in December, has the support of the Gio and Mano tribes of 
northeastern Liberia against Doe's Krahn tribe. 
</P>
<P>
International human rights groups say government troops have killed hundreds of 
Gio and Mano civilians since the insurgency began in late December. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, rebels gathered outside Robertsfield International Airport, 25 
miles from Monrovia, which was built to serve the plantation. The rebels' 
presence has effectively closed the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Off Monrovia, four U.S. warships carrying 2,000 Marines remained ready to 
evacuate Americans and other foreigners, including the 10 to 15 Soviet 
diplomats in Liberia, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said 33 Americans 
were evacuated Monday while thousands had left earlier. He said 70 U.S. 
officials and about 1,200 private American citizens remained. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday that the ships are off 
Liberia "solely on a contingency basis to evacuate American citizens if it 
becomes necessary. . . . The U.S. military has no role to play in this 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Doe, a former army master sergeant who seized power in a 1980 coup, said last 
week he would not run for reelection in 1991, but he refused to resign in the 
face of the rebel advances. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a former Doe associate who fled the country in 1983 to escape fraud 
charges, has said Doe must quit as president as a precondition for peace talks.

KHMER ROUGE BOYCOTTS CAMBODIAN CEASE-FIRE; 
</P>

SOUTHEAST ASIA: OTHER PARTIES SIGN AN ACCORD CALLED A 'HALF SUCCESS.'

The Cambodian government and the nominal head of the insurgent coalition 
warring against it signed an agreement here Tuesday for a cease-fire and an 
interim control council, but the Khmer Rouge, militarily the most powerful of 
the three rebel groups in the alliance, boycotted the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Sihanouk told reporters that a two-day meeting, the first 
international peace conference in Tokyo since World War II, was a "half 
success." But the Khmer Rouge, and its supporter, China, are the key to whether 
there will be peace. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cambodian monarch, who was ousted in a 1970 coup, signed the 
agreement with Cambodian Premier Hun Sen, whose government is backed by 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, also approved by rebel leader Son Sann of the Khmer People's 
National Liberation Front, calls for a cease-fire in the 11-year-old war and 
specifies the composition of an ad hoc body, the Supreme National Council. The 
council would "symbolize Cambodia's neutrality, national sovereignty and 
national unity" until elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the American-supported 
Sihanouk said Hun Sun's government will name six representatives to the supreme 
council, while his backers and those of Son Sann will each appoint three. 
</P>
<P>
A deadline of July 31 was set to convene the first meeting of the supreme 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge, which is blamed for the deaths of 
more than a million Cambodians when it ruled between 1975 and 1978, refused to 
sign the agreement. But Sihanouk left the door open to the Khmer Rouge to join 
later, saying his royalists and the backers of Son Sann would each yield one 
seat if the Communist group decided to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite American opposition to any role in government for the Khmer Rouge, such 
an arrangement would give the Khmer Rouge a one-sixth share in the supreme 
council, instead of the one-fourth share that it demands. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge also insists that the share of the Hun Sen government be 
limited to one quarter of the seats. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said the agreement means, at the least, that his forces and the troops 
of Son Sann will stop fighting immediately. Looking at Son Sann seated next to 
him, the prince asked, "You are going to stop fighting, aren't you? Yes or no?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," replied Son Sann. It was the only word he spoke at the news conference, 
which was not attended by Hun Sen or Khieu Samphan. 
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan stayed away from the talks Monday and Tuesday. Japanese 
officials, as well as Thailand's deputy prime minister, Gen. Chavalit 
Yongchaiyudh, served as intermediaries between him and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk acknowledged that the Khmer Rouge is likely to continue fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the day we have an international control mechanism . . . it will be 
difficult to implement a cease-fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama told Parliament today that Japan will ask China, 
the main weapons supplier for the Khmer Rouge, to exert pressure on the 
Communist rebels to accept the accord. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese have been very understanding," one Japanese official said. 
</P>
<P>
Nakayama said Japan's main hope in hosting the conference was to prevent the 
Cambodian peace dialogue from stagnating. Signing of the agreement, he said, 
accomplished that aim. The next step, he said, will come when the five 
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, the Soviet 
Union, Britain, France and China -- meet in July. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials had insisted that any cease-fire agreement -- the four 
factions had signed one earlier -- be tied to an enforcement mechanism as well 
as an interim arrangement leading to elections for a new government. 
</P>
<P>
An international peacekeeping force would be charged not only with implementing 
a cease-fire agreement but would also "monitor, supervise and verify the 
withdrawal of all foreign forces and the cessation of all foreign military 
assistance," the Tokyo agreement specified. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said the ultimate aim of his followers and those of Son Sann and the 
Khmer Rouge is the expulsion of Vietnamese troops and the recovery of territory 
"colonized and annexed" by Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge, says that 
it has removed all of its troops and that only advisers, technicians and 
intelligence officers remain. U.S. officials, however, charge that 40,000 
Vietnamese combat troops are still in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
A supreme council for Cambodia is to be convened by the end of July, and the 
parties to the Tokyo accord are to implement a cease-fire by that date. But the 
Khmer Rouge, the strongest rebel group, did not accept the Tokyo agreement, and 
its participation is in question. The parties urged that a Paris conference on 
Cambodia be reconvened and asked to monitor and supervise the cease-fire with 
U.N. assistance.

REGULATORY AGENCY SHOWS A TENDENCY FOR ACTIVISMIT MAY HAVE TO ACT ON A 
REVOLUTION IN PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS, INCLUDING POCKET TELEPHONES AND 
HIGH-DEFINITION TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The decade of the 1990s may see a revolution in personal communications that 
will rival the computer revolution of the 1980s, as those familiar devices -- 
the telephone and the television -- undergo sweeping changes. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1990s, the trendy consumer is likely to tote a tiny, inexpensive 
telephone in his pocket as he walks down the street or flies across the 
country. At home, his television could display a picture as sharp as the finest 
color photograph. And, if he is irked by the local cable company, he may be 
able to pay to get his television signals bounced off a satellite or relayed 
over telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
The expected rush of change has focused new attention on the Federal 
Communications Commission, the agency that will help shape these new 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"With personal computers, we could all stand back and let the market evolve. 
But, with the personal communication revolution, the government has to be 
involved because you are dealing with the airwaves," said Thomas Stanley, the 
FCC's chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Because available broadcast frequencies are scarce, Congress long ago gave the 
FCC the job of deciding who gets to use them. And, with the spread of cellular 
transmission, the advent of pocket-sized phones and the potential for new 
satellite broadcasting, demand for available airwaves matches that for 
Manhattan real estate, Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the FCC has shown a new activism, in contrast with the Ronald Reagan 
era, when the word regulation became nearly as taboo as taxes. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush, in his first year as President, appointed a new FCC chairman, 
Alfred C. Sikes, and filled three of the other four commission seats. Sikes has 
wasted no time in making his mark. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In March, Sikes took the first step toward defining "high-definition TV" by 
announcing that he favors setting aside new channels for the sophisticated 
signals, rather than trying to upgrade existing channels. The decision has the 
advantage of allowing consumers to keep their existing television sets while 
the new system is phased in. In early 1993, the FCC will issue specific 
technical standards for the new type of television signal, which will be in 
American households a year or two afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last month, the FCC licensed the first large-scale experiments with 
pocket-sized phones in Orlando, Fla., and Houston. Next week, the commission 
will undertake a broad study of the emerging field to answer some basic 
questions: Should a local phone company sell the "poor man's cellular," or 
should the new wireless systems compete with existing phone and cellular 
companies? Should the FCC set aside special space on the airwaves to encourage 
the new industry, as the British government did last year? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two weeks ago, Sikes spoke at the convention of the National Cable 
Television Assn. and said the nation will "not tolerate an unregulated monopoly 
indefinitely." In late July, the FCC will advise Congress as to what it can do 
about the cable industry, the target of widespread complaints about poor 
service and steadily rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
Sikes already has made clear that he favors creating more competition, rather 
than returning to rate regulation by city officials. One possibility would be 
to let telephone companies enter the business of delivering broadcast signals. 
A second possibility is a technology called Sky Cable, in which a broadcast 
signal is bounced off a satellite to a small dish-shaped antenna at a user's 
residence. In February, four companies announced plans to develop such a 
service and make it available to consumers by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
As a fall-back approach, the FCC could change its regulations and allow local 
rate regulation again. In 1984, Congress said cable rate regulation should end 
in any market in which there is "effective competition." The 
deregulation-minded FCC of the Reagan Administration decreed in 1985 that such 
competition exists anywhere residents can receive three over-the-air signals. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to have an advanced degree in economics" to realize the flaw in 
this approach, said Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.). Virtually every American 
home can get three broadcast signals but still have only one choice for cable 
service. Sikes said the FCC is now "reexamining" its 1985 decree. 
</P>
<P>
To many observers of the FCC, these moves by Sikes signal a new willingness to 
regulate in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a total transformation of that commission," said Andrew J. 
Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access Project. "It's not as 
ideological. They're willing at least to enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
No one has accused Sikes, a former radio broadcaster from Missouri, of being a 
heavy-handed regulator. Instead, he stresses that the FCC must be "friendly to 
innovation and technology."

BUSH TO DELAY SUBMITTING SOVIET TRADE PACT TO LAWMAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO GIVE GORBACHEV A CHANCE TO DEFUSE THE 
LITHUANIA CRISIS. MOSCOW ALSO NEEDS TIME TO MEET U.S. CONDITIONS FOR SPECIAL 
TRADE STATUS.

The White House said Tuesday that it does not expect to send the new Soviet 
trade agreement to Congress for several months or more, a delay that will give 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev time to try to ease the stalemate in 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no formal link between the trade accord and a resolution of the 
Baltic republic's bid for independence, President Bush may face considerable 
obstacles in winning congressional approval of the trade agreement if Congress 
doubts that the Baltic dispute will be settled peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it linkage or call it reality," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), summing up the difficulties that the Administration is likely to face 
if the Lithuanian situation is not resolved when the trade accord is debated by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also hope to gain "most-favored-nation" status, which would grant 
low tariffs to their products imported by the United States. The sought-after 
trade status will not be conferred until the Soviet national legislature 
approves measures guaranteeing free emigration rights to Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow on Tuesday, lawmakers tentatively put off adoption of the emigration 
law. The agenda it approved for the current session, which ends June 14, does 
not include the issue, and the Supreme Soviet does not reconvene until 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation would allow those to emigrate who have entry visas 
from their host country and no current obligations, criminal charges or recent 
knowledge of state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, meeting Tuesday with Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and 
Senate, told them that it probably will be months before action is taken in the 
Soviet Union on the emigration legislation, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That may not be bad in the sense of it gives them a little time to work on the 
emigration issue and to make sure that everybody is aware of what their plans 
are," Fitzwater said, indicating that the Bush Administration sees no problem 
in the delay. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he said moments later, "it might well be that, by the time the 
emigration law was passed and we were ready to go forward with this, that there 
would be action on Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"While the two are not linked directly . . . there's an influence there that 
cannot be denied," the White House spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush decided to approve the trade agreement just half an 
hour before the signing ceremony, after Gorbachev repeatedly argued on behalf 
of the pact during their meetings Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said at his joint news conference with Gorbachev on Sunday that the Soviet 
leader had given him no specific assurances that the economic embargo on 
Lithuania would be lifted, and he indicated that there is no linkage between 
Lithuania and trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Under special trade legislation applying to Communist countries, the agreement 
must be approved by a majority vote in both the House and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the agreement signed by the two presidents is mainly a symbolic 
turning point in the trade relations between the two nations. It covers the 
standard list of requirements set by the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment involving 
freedom of emigration. It also includes guarantees of property rights and 
currency exchange for American companies doing business in the Soviet Union. 
And it calls for establishment of consulates outside the respective capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's signing of the trade agreement with Gorbachev on Friday during the 
Soviet president's four-day visit to Washington drew sharp criticism Monday 
from Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). He said that Bush had 
"effectively abandoned Lithuania" by completing the agreement without first 
requiring the Soviet Union to lift its economic blockade against the breakaway 
Baltic republic. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said after the Tuesday morning meeting that he had heard nothing from 
Bush to change his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Majority Leader Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who was among those on the 
Soviet president's flight to California on Sunday evening, predicted that the 
trade accord would not win congressional approval without some progress toward 
a settlement in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
When he told Gorbachev that the Congress would not ratify the trade agreement 
if there is violence in Lithuania, Gorbachev replied: "It's not going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Cranston said at a news conference after attending the White House 
meeting: "If there is any violence, I'm confident Bush wouldn't submit it." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Cranston said he advised Gorbachev that the Senate would not ratify 
a strategic arms reduction treaty if there is violence in Lithuania. He said 
that Gorbachev replied: "Nothing like that will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Stating his own decision to vote for the trade agreement, Cranston said: "There 
always will be something that people will use" to deny the trade advantages to 
the Soviets. He added that the United States would also benefit from a trade 
pact. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flurry of post-summit diplomatic activity continued. Bush spoke 
by telephone with French President Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday morning to 
report on the Gorbachev meetings, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the White House spokesman announced that Bush will meet with 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu sometime before the July 9-11 Houston 
economic summit conference of the leading industrial democracies. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the White House Situation Room, the 24-hour 
communications and crisis center in the basement of the White House, received a 
message at 1:39 a.m. EDT Tuesday from Gorbachev, as the Soviet president's 
Ilyushin-62M aircraft cleared U.S. airspace on the eastward flight from San 
Francisco to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to express my deep satisfaction with the results of my visit. The work 
we have done together during these days will bear good fruit," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Sara Fritz contributed to this report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Soviet emigration law would allow departures for virtually anyone 
who has permission to enter another country and no outstanding obligations, 
criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets. The bill, delayed in the 
Soviet legislature on Tuesday, would also set a basic limit of five years on 
the length of time a citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to 
secrets. Complete details have not been released, but the bill is believed to 
codify many reforms already put into practice. Before the liberalization, tens 
of thousands of Jews and others were refused exit visas, becoming known as 
refuseniks.

MASSACRE ON A BUS: A SIGN OF BHUTTO'S SLIPPING GRIP ON POWER, CRITICS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
PAKISTAN: THE ATTACK LEFT 27 DEAD, 41 HURT. IT WAS THE LATEST EPISODE IN A 
VICIOUS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS CREATED THE PRIME MINISTER'S WORST CRISIS 
YET.

KARACHI, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 100 weary commuters were packed into the No. 17 bus in Karachi when it 
became the latest target in one of the world's bloodiest undeclared urban wars. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after 7 p.m. last Thursday, four hooded men in a taxi forced the 
bus to stop and opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles, circling the vehicle and 
raking it with hundreds of rounds. Three minutes later, while passengers wailed 
Koranic prayers and screamed for help, 27 people lay dead and 41 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were women, children, tailors, bakers and other tradesmen. 
And even this shellshocked city has been left reeling with horror at the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
The attack, attributed to nationalists in the province of Sind, was the latest 
episode in a vicious cycle of Sindi violence that has presented Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto with her worst crisis yet. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since she took office in 1988, Bhutto, who had fought for 
years against a harsh martial-law regime, has been forced to call out the army 
to restore order in her home province. 
</P>
<P>
An infantry division of nearly 20,000 men has set up 300 sandbagged machine-gun 
emplacements at locations throughout the city. Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, the army 
chief of staff, vowed to use "an iron hand" to end the conflict, which has left 
hundreds dead this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
For many critics, Bhutto's decision to use the army is an admission of defeat 
for her government and a strong signal that the 36-year-old prime minister's 
grip on power may be weakening. 
</P>
<P>
Karachi and Sind are the foundation of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, and 
her people have held the reins of power throughout the province during a time 
when law and order have all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say Bhutto's policies have favored the province's Sindi-speaking 
natives over Urdu-speaking Indian migrants who are the backbone of a growing, 
urban middle class. They also charge that she is responsible for worsening the 
polarization of the two heavily armed communities. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, independent analysts say, calling out the army is only a stopgap 
measure, and in any case the fighting between the Sindis and the Indian 
migrants, known as Mohajirs, is only one aspect of the violence sweeping this 
city of 10 million. They say that Karachi, the financial capital of Pakistan, 
is virtually run by international drug syndicates, local bandit mafias and 
sniper gangs who are as well-armed as Gen. Beg's army. 
</P>
<P>
"This place has become a jungle," said Farooq Sumar, a Karachi industrialist 
who has helped organize businessmen nationwide in the Movement for the 
Restoration of Peace in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
"There are arsenals of weapons in the university campuses. Everyone has machine 
guns and rocket launchers. What we have is a situation where the two problems 
of arms and ethnic unrest are feeding each other. If there was just ethnic 
trouble without all these arms, the problem would be less. The bottom line is 
that people can't talk to each other when everyone has arms in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Karachi has been prone to violence for nearly a decade, since it became the hub 
for heroin exports leaving the frontier area between Afghanistan and Pakistan 
and for arms supplied by the CIA to guerrillas in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here say the violence has escalated sharply in the past few 
weeks. Last week's toll: nearly 300 dead. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be in a downward spiral," said one diplomat who requested 
anonymity. "Each episode is worse than previous episodes." 
</P>
<P>
On the last day of May, the day the No. 17 bus was shot up, other gunmen opened 
fire in a courtroom of the Karachi High Court, killing a prominent lawyer and 
two clerks. Over the weekend, three journalists were shot to death in 
provincial towns. According to army sources, radical Sind groups have targeted 
25 reporters for Urdu-speaking newspapers. In another incident, a national 
senator was shot by a sniper while touring Karachi's worst-hit neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Other targets include businessmen and industrialists, some killed and others 
abducted. Many have fled the province and taken sanctuary elsewhere in Pakistan 
or abroad. 
</P>
<P>
For Farooq Sumar and many Karachi intellectuals, the "anarchic state of 
affairs" they referred to in a petition hand-delivered to Bhutto is rooted in a 
political paradox. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, an international symbol of democracy, has restored free elections, 
freedom of the press, an open court system and other trappings of democracy 
since her election in 1988. But in doing so she relied on the support of feudal 
rural lords who now serve in Parliament as members of her party. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is supposed to be the death knell for feudalism, but here we're 
trying to make them coexist," Farooq said. "It has become a mockery of 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The feudal lords are the backbone of the Sind nationalist movement, and this 
has brought on criticism that the Bhutto government and the police are siding 
with the Sindis. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian migrants, represented in the fighting by the heavily armed and 
increasingly militant Mohajir Freedom Movement, are in the majority in Karachi 
and other urban areas of Sind. 
</P>
<P>
They have 14 seats in Parliament, and they had formed an alliance with Bhutto's 
party. But soon after the election the alliance was broken, and the Mohajirs 
have felt ever since that they are being persecuted by the Bhutto government 
and the police. 
</P>
<P>
The Mohajirs look to the army for help, and thousands of them took to the 
streets to cheer when the army was called out. Many carried portraits of the 
late dictator, Gen. Zia ul-Haq, who strengthened the Mohajir movement as a foil 
against the largely pro-Bhutto Sindi nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, though, the rift between the two groups is spreading into the 
police and army, leading many analysts to fear that martial law will be 
reimposed in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Military men make no secret of their disdain for the police, who are widely 
regarded as corrupt and given to brutal treatment. They blame the police for 
the latest spiral of violence, which began with a series of killings in 
Hyderabad. Police opened fire on Mohajirs trying to protect four alleged 
bandits. Nearly 100 civilians were killed.

BROAD ATTACK ON POVERTY PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT: A GROUP OF PRIVATE SECTOR LEADERS CALLS FOR 'A NEW COMMITMENT' TO 
EXPANDING THE NATION'S MINORITY MIDDLE CLASS.

<P>
A task force of corporate and academic leaders appealed Tuesday for "a new 
national commitment" to supporting a growing minority middle class and 
assisting an impoverished underclass, but offered few specifics and no 
financial proposals for achieving the ambitious goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Business-Higher Education Forum, a coalition of more than 90 chief 
executives of Fortune 500 firms and prestigious U.S. colleges and universities, 
said in its report that the failure of poor blacks and Latinos to thrive in the 
workplace "will require concerted efforts by the full range of our institutions 
-- federal, state and local governments; colleges and universities and the 
nation's corporations." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference called to unveil the 85-page report, "Three Realities: 
Minority Life in the United States," forum officials lauded middle-class blacks 
and Latinos who are "making it" in American society, but lamented that nearly 
two-thirds of all minorities are "at the margin" or already among "the poor and 
the underclass." 
</P>
<P>
Among the forum's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than a third of all blacks and Latino citizens are middle class. Some 
36% of black families have annual incomes of $25,000 or more, and 40% of Latino 
families are in that income bracket, compared to about 60% of white families. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Between 25% and 30% of all minorities are semiskilled or unskilled workers 
who are just a paycheck or two away from slipping into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About a third of all minorities live in persistent poverty, and that 
proportion is escalating rapidly. The poverty rate among black families was 
nearly three times that of whites in 1986. From 1970 until 1980, the number of 
poor people in the country's five largest cities rose 161%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minorities are held back by racism, poor education, limited business 
opportunities and "the stranglehold of the inner city" that stifles 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton R. Wharton Jr., co-chairman of the forum's task force on minorities and 
the workplace, said that corporate and academic leaders have become concerned 
because blacks' and Latinos' being stuck at the bottom of the economy threatens 
the nation's standard of living and ability to compete on a global scale in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next 10 years, over 40% of the new entrants into the work force will 
be immigrants and minorities," said Wharton, who is chairman and chief 
executive officer of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Assn. of America and the 
College Retirement Equities Fund, a New York-based private pension fund for 
professors. "Unless they come fully into the economic and civic mainstream," he 
said, "U.S. business and industry won't have the men and women needed for an 
energetic and productive ecomony." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton and Steve C. Mason, another co-chairman of the task force, pointed to 
the report's broad and unspecific array of recommendations for public and 
private efforts to help poor minorities navigate their way upward. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals are increasing spending for public jobs and training 
programs, restructuring the welfare system, expanding government involvement 
toward preventing teen-age pregnancy, passage of federal laws to attack 
education problems in low-income communities, increasing spending on 
student-assistance programs and expanding corporate affirmative-action efforts. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned about how the nation could afford such social initiatives, 
Wharton and Mason sidestepped the issue of whether they would require new taxes 
or specific cuts in other federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, these recommendations are expensive," said Mason. "We do not have a 
totally definitive set of recommendations" as to how to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that the forum did not poll its members as to whether they would 
support raising taxes to pay for following the report's proposals. He said that 
a majority of the membership would be willing to pay higher taxes to ensure a 
productive economic future for poor and unemployable blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak for all the top executives in the country, I can only really 
speak for one," said Mason, who is president and chief operating officer of The 
Mead Corp., an Ohio-based forest and paper products company. 
</P>
<P>
"My conviction is that these issues are important enough that they have to be 
funded."

NEW JERSEY SCHOOL FUNDING UNFAIR TO POOR, STATE'S HIGH COURT RULES

<P>
New Jersey is failing miserably at educating poor urban students, the state 
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in a decision that declared unconstitutional the 
way aid is distributed to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruled, in effect, that determining school funding based on 
property tax revenues is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence compels but one conclusion: the poorer the district and the 
greater its need, the less the money available, and the worse the education," 
Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz wrote. "These students simply cannot possibly 
enter the same market or the same society as their peers educated in wealthier 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a unanimous decision, ordered lawmakers to begin reforms by 
the 1991-92 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The state must assure that poor urban districts spend about the same amount of 
money per child as richer suburban districts, the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The court estimated that the state needs to add $440 million to its 
$3.5-billion public schools budget to remedy disparities in the 28 poorest 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's ruling is a clear victory for the children of New Jersey," said Gov. 
James J. Florio, who last week announced a plan to raise the state income tax. 
The tax increase would raise $1 billion for more aid to middle-income and poor 
districts, and aid to wealthier school systems would be reduced or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has recognized that the current school funding system is leading us 
to be two New Jerseys -- where some youngsters head for the best colleges and 
others go down a road to nowhere," Florio said, predicting that his reform 
proposal will satisfy the court. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey is among more than a dozen states in which courts have overturned 
school finance systems in recent years.

President Bush has selected Edith E. Holiday, the Treasury Department's top

Lawyer Thomas Root, who was plucked from the Atlantic Ocean last year after a 
mysterious six-hour solo flight during which he was shot, pleaded guilty in 
federal court Tuesday to five felony charges of misrepresenting clients. 
</P>
<P>
Root faces up to 35 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The federal charges involve five clients who had been seeking broadcast 
licenses from the Federal Communications Commission. A federal grand jury 
returned a 33-count indictment against Root in March, but the other 28 charges 
were dropped as part of a plea agreement in which he pledged to cooperate in 
related investigations. 
</P>
<P>
He was released on his own recognizance. Sentencing was scheduled for Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The plea bargain was announced one day after Root was named, along with three 
other people and two companies, in a 2,695-count indictment filed in Nash 
County, N.C. He was charged there with 455 counts of state securities fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Root, 37, refused to comment after entering his plea Tuesday in U.S. District 
Court. His attorney, Eugene Propper, said that Root "feels he's getting a lot 
more attention" than he otherwise would because of the July 13 flight. 
</P>
<P>
Root told authorities that he blacked out during the flight and that the plane 
continued on autopilot. But Navy fighter pilots who intercepted the flight said 
they saw Root moving in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 210 crashed in the Atlantic off the Bahamas. When Root was rescued, 
he had a gunshot wound in his stomach. The wound has not been explained. 
</P>
<P>
Root, who in October filed for bankruptcy, has denied that the flight was 
connected to financial or legal troubles.

HOUSE VOTES TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF NUCLEAR TESTS

Uranium miners and people who lived downwind from nuclear testing would get 
money and an apology from the government for the radiation sickness they now 
suffer, under a bill the House approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is an apology to those people and their heirs on behalf of the 
government and the American people that they were subjected and sacrificed for 
the Cold War nuclear weapons," said Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah), sponsor of the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, the measure was passed on a 
voice vote. President Bush opposes the bill, which is awaiting floor action in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Those affected lived in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and 
Wyoming. Many are Navajo Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation stems in part from 10 years of work by Stewart Udall, former 
congressman and secretary of the Interior, who represented the uranium miners 
in a lawsuit against the government in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The courts ruled that the government was immune from prosecution because 
national security needs required a huge flow of uranium ore to make weapons 
that could be used against the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The courts ruled similarly in the cases of the so-called "downwinders." Udall 
said that, despite the rulings, some of the judges who handled the cases wrote 
opinions that counseled the plaintiffs to seek redress from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the House of Representatives restores our nation's honor by holding the 
government responsible for Cold War abuses that have stained our collective 
consciences by causing death and injury to its own people," Owens said. "The 
Cold War can't be over until we have paid the debt to the civilian victims."

DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT BUSH WILL BE BRIEFED TODAY BY THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADER ON 
THE MEETING.

The negotiations were so secretive and sensitive that Seoul's Blue House, the 
office of South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, kept its own Foreign Ministry in 
the dark, and U.S. and South Korean officials both agreed not to tell the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
At one crucial point, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the former Soviet ambassador to the 
United States, was sent from Moscow to Seoul to continue the high-level, 
clandestine diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's historic meeting between Roh and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
was the result of several months of furtive, on-again, off-again negotiations 
among senior officials of South Korea, the Soviet Union and the United States, 
which played the dual role of host and marriage-broker. Roh flew to Washington 
on Tuesday and will tell President Bush today about his groundbreaking session 
here with the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
The event was a milestone, not only for South Korea but also for U.S. policy in 
Asia and perhaps Soviet policy as well. Not since the days of World War II has 
the United States tried so hard to encourage top-level contact between the 
Soviet Union and an American ally in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were, in effect, opening the door for the Soviet Union in a 
country where more than 40,000 American troops remain as part of the U.S. 
military policy of forward deployment in Asia and the Pacific. The United 
States was willing to do this because the Roh-Gorbachev meeting enhanced the 
stature of its South Korean ally and eventually could help spur political and 
economic changes in the heavily militarized Communist regime of North Korean 
President Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Bush Administration has sought to portray the Roh-Gorbachev 
session as one that was worked out solely by the Soviets and South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just providing the turf," one State Department official insisted last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, however, the United States was intimately involved in arranging the 
Roh-Gorbachev meeting, according to accounts of American and South Korean 
sources familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the meeting dates back to last April. At that time, Kim Young Sam, 
one of the leaders of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party, had just 
returned from a trip to Moscow in which he succeeded in meeting with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, planning was already under way for the impending summit meeting 
between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. U.S., South Korean and Soviet officials 
began talking about the possibility of having Roh come to the United States at 
the same time. Roh had already scheduled a visit to Canada and Mexico for late 
May. The idea was that he could stop in Washington during the same trip. 
</P>
<P>
According to one senior Bush Administration official, the United States was 
worried that the Soviet Union might seek to revive an old idea called 
"cross-recognition" -- asking that the United States make some gesture toward 
North Korea parallel to the Soviet overture to the south. U.S. officials were 
prepared with a series of arguments outlining why issues involving North Korea 
should be kept on a separate track. 
</P>
<P>
However, said this official, "the Soviets never raised the issue." 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, according to another U.S. source, South Korean officials pressed 
hard for a three-way meeting in which Roh would meet in Washington with both 
Gorbachev and Bush. Soviet officials rejected this idea, which would have 
turned the South Korean leader into one of the star attractions surrounding the 
summit itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a suggestion," Ambassador Hong-choo Hyun, South Korea's permanent 
observer to the United Nations, told The Times. "A three-way meeting turned out 
to be impractical, considering all the complications involved." 
</P>
<P>
And so, through much of May, the secret diplomacy stalled. One U.S. official 
suggested that the lack of agreement on a meeting with Gorbachev was one of the 
factors that prompted Roh to cancel his late-May trip to Canada and Mexico. 
South Korea said that the president needed to remain in Seoul to deal with 
labor upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came when Dobrynin, Gorbachev's top foreign policy adviser, 
visited Seoul in late May. The Soviets and South Koreans agreed to a 
Roh-Gorbachev meeting in San Francisco, away from the Washington summit. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco was fine with us," said one Bush Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. source said that, until the last minute, the Blue House cut the 
Foreign Ministry out of the talks to prevent news leaks. The Japanese were kept 
in the dark for similar reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"That is possible, because these things are very sensitive," Hyun conceded in 
an interview. "But once the decision was made (for the Roh-Gorbachev meeting), 
the (South Korean) Foreign Ministry was the first to be contacted." 
</P>
<P>
The news broke in Seoul on May 30, as Foreign Ministry officials began to make 
final plans for Roh's trip to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, North Korean officials had scheduled a meeting with U.S. officials 
in Beijing on that day, May 30. It was the tenth in a series of talks over the 
last two years between U.S. and North Korean diplomats in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
At that session in Beijing, however, North Korea had nothing new or 
far-reaching to discuss. It is not clear whether the North Koreans were aware 
then of the plans for Roh to meet Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Having helped to orchestrate the breakthrough, some Bush Administration 
officials now admit that they have a few qualms about possible implications of 
a rapprochement between Moscow and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets have their own agenda," one U.S. official noted. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Gorbachev may attempt to play off two U.S. allies -- Japan and 
South Korea -- against each other. Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union 
remain cool, primarily because of a dispute over four islands off Japan that 
the Soviet Union has occupied since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Further, a State Department official said he is worried that Gorbachev may seek 
to "use the South Koreans for their own purposes" by seeking to revive the old 
Soviet idea of a collective security conference in Asia. The United States has 
long opposed these proposals. 
</P>
<P>
But in the glow of Monday's historic meeting, all such problems seemed minor 
and manageable. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.S. role in bringing Roh and Gorbachev together, one South 
Korean official smiled and quipped: "The meeting is a success. So it has many 
fathers."

IRANIAN LEADER RENEWS RUSHDIE DEATH DECREE

Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated Tuesday that a 
religious death warrant against British author Salman Rushdie is irrevocable 
and "must be carried out." 
</P>
<P>
There had been reports Iran was relaxing its stance on the death sentence, 
issued by the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini before his own 
death last year, in order to improve relations with Europe. 
</P>
<P>
TThe sentence stems from Rushdie's book, "The Sataanic Versus," which Moslems 
consider blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei told clerics in Tehran that the death edict is based on "divine 
messages and is equally solid and irrevocable." 
</P>
<P>
"Salman Rushdie is a criminal and the divine sentence on him must be carried 
out," the Iranian leader said. The statement came a day after the official 
first anniversary of Khomeini's death. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Iranian Foreign Ministry official Hussein Musavian categorically denied 
a report in a London newspaper, The Sunday Times, quoting him as saying the 
death warrant might be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Musavian told the official Islamic Republic News Agency that remarks attributed 
to him in The Sunday Times were a distortion. 
</P>
<P>
But Iran's state radio Sunday quoted Musavian as saying: "The Iranian 
government has not formally insisted on the murder of Salman Rushdie. If 
Britain condemns the insults to Iran and demonstrates its respect to Islam, 
this could help in improving relations and be effective in the release of 
British hostages in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a 
phone-in question program that Great Britain has the "greatest respect for 
Islam. But obviously we cannot do anything to hinder freedom of speech in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain in March 1989 after Khomeini 
issued the religious decree sentencing Rushdie to death.

The Chinese government warned foreign correspondents Tuesday to cease "illegal" 
news coverage after journalists reported two nights of protests by Beijing 
University students. 
</P>
<P>
Several foreign journalists have been beaten, kicked, harassed and dispersed at 
gunpoint by police recently while attempting to cover the campus protests and 
activities around Tian An Men Square in the heart of the city. The 
anti-government protests were held to commemorate the anniversary of the army's 
crackdown on last year's student-led democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing lodged a protest with the government 
Tuesday, objecting to "the unprovoked use of violence and physical abuse" of 
foreign journalists by paramilitary and plainclothes security police. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to us that these actions are an attempt to intimidate members of 
the foreign press and prevent us from carrying out legitimate reporting 
activities in China," the correspondents' letter of protest said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Munson, president of the Correspondents Club and a reporter for Canadian 
television, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday even before the 
correspondents' protest could be delivered. A Foreign Ministry official told 
Munson that "the so-called protest . . . is utterly unreasonable" and that he 
will be held responsible for its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The official charged that some journalists violated city regulations by 
entering university campuses without formally applying to do so. He said "a 
small number" of foreign journalists have connections with Chinese engaged in 
illegal activities and "even colluded with them." 
</P>
<P>
Munson said he told the official that the Correspondents Club was protesting 
the physical abuse and detention of journalists who were "conducting legitimate 
work on the streets of Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
The Correspondents Club letter cited five cases of rough treatment of foreign 
journalists: 
</P>
<P>
Armed paramilitary police struck Los Angeles Times correspondent David Holley 
and beat his wife, Fumiyo, with rifle butts outside the Beijing University 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Plainclothes police kicked Reuters photographer Richard Ellis in the head and 
smashed his camera. 
</P>
<P>
A policeman severely beat West German television correspondent Gisela 
Mahlmann-Hermann of ZDF with a truncheon. 
</P>
<P>
ABC correspondents Todd Carrel and Masaaki Serita-Ogushi were assaulted and 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
CBS cameraman Bradley Simpson was physically mistreated and pieces of his 
equipment were seized.

There they are, roaring through the neighborhood, hanging out in their 
clubhouse on Fix Way in Ventura, leather-clad, tattooed, full-bearded, 
hog-mounted, the dreaded words "Hells Angels" defiantly arched across their 
broad backs. 
</P>
<P>
But the city isn't trembling. The cops aren't braced for trouble. And the 
neighbors actually have nice things to say about the bikers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are good people," said P. Hamlet, a middle-aged woman who lives up the 
block. "They'll do anything for you." 
</P>
<P>
Hamlet has never actually met a Hells Angel, although they have been neighbors 
for 15 years. But her view is shared by others. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't bother us except when they have a party every once in a while," 
said Alice Steward, manager of a mobile home park behind the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
A New Year's Eve party lasted until about 3 a.m., she said. But for the most 
part, "they don't come across the wall." 
</P>
<P>
The manager of an auto repair shop next to the clubhouse agreed. "They're cool. 
I've had no problems with them." 
</P>
<P>
The police describe the group as low-profile and say they haven't had a run-in 
with the bikers in years. 
</P>
<P>
"Christie's strongest rule is to keep a low profile in town and don't cause any 
problems," a police sergeant said, referring to George Christie Jr., the 
chapter leader. "We don't devote any more attention to them than anyone else on 
the avenue. There has never been any need for it." 
</P>
<P>
Christie is a soft-spoken, articulate man who attended two years of college and 
married his high school sweetheart when he was 20. He has two teen-agers and 
owns a business, a martial arts studio. 
</P>
<P>
His profile did jump briefly three years ago when he was tried on a charge of 
soliciting the murder of a government informant, an ex-Angel whose death was 
faked by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal prosecutors produced two taped conversations in which Christie 
and another government informant purportedly settled on the murder plan, 
Christie claimed that he was framed. 
</P>
<P>
A federal court jury acquitted him, and several jurors said later that they 
liked him and found him to be an upstanding character. To show his gratitude, 
Christie and three dozen fellow bikers held a barbecue for the jury on the lawn 
outside the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' home on Fix Way is a white single-story building with heavy metal 
screens on the windows and doors. A video camera inside allows members to watch 
the front. Located in a working-class neighborhood near downtown Ventura, it 
shares the block with several auto repair shops, a bakery and a cabinet 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
The clubhouse contains a living room with a TV and stereo, a recreation room 
with video games and a pool table, and a motorcycle repair shop, equipped with 
state-of-the-art tools. 
</P>
<P>
Since his trial, Christie has cultivated something of a respectable reputation 
for the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to create problems for any of our neighbors and we don't want 
them to create problems for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Smith, executive director of the Ventura Convention and Visitors Bureau, 
said the Angels earned his respect when Christie raised $3,000 from bikers and 
ran in the 1984 Olympic Torch Relay. The money raised by the bikers was 
directed to the Special Olympics in Pottstown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought that was a hell of a deal," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie said he is one of two married members of the group. He would not say 
how many members are in the Ventura chapter, only that their ages range from 21 
to 50. (Law enforcement officials believe that the number may be as low as 
five.) 
</P>
<P>
Christie said that for years the Hells Angels have been persecuted because of a 
grossly inaccurate stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
"You mention Hells Angels and people say 'O, my God,' " he said. "And then you 
ask them 'How many Hells Angels have you met?' and they say 'None.' " 
</P>
<P>
Warm feelings about the Hells Angels are not shared by federal law enforcement 
officials, who are deeply suspicious of what goes on behind the clubhouse 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because they have a low profile doesn't mean that has changed them," said 
Bill Modesitt, who heads the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's regional 
office in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"They can be businessmen. They are shrewd people and they know how to work the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department in Sacramento said the Hells 
Angels has established its reputation as a powerful organization, which she 
compared to the Mafia of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't need to beat anybody up," she said. "They can just look at someone 
and they know they are the Hells Angels."

A 1980 study by the DEA said four motorcycle gangs -- the Hells Angels, the 
Outlaws, the Bandidos and the Pagans -- are reported to control as much as 50% 
of the country's illegal methamphetamine market. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the Angels were described by a state commission in 1979 as 
dominating clandestine laboratories making methamphetamine in Northern 
California and being "heavily involved in this illegal market in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Christie said Ventura Angels do not engage in criminal activities. Of the 
suspicions of federal officials, he said: "These are allegations that have been 
drifting around for years, and they have yet to prove that the club sells 
narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
There are 13 Hells Angels chapters in the state, 30 nationwide and 72 
worldwide, according to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of each state group meet monthly. National and international 
representatives meet annually, according to the government. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell me," the Justice Department spokeswoman said, "are they organized?"

Federal agents arrested three Placer County residents in a Reno casino on 
charges of trafficking in machine guns. A complaint filed in Reno federal court 
named George Green, 42, and his wife Kathleen, 35, of Newcastle, and Milford M. 
Johnson Jr., 37, of Auburn. An Internal Revenue Service agent said the arrests 
grew out of information gained in a drug investigation dubbed "Deep Snow," 
which led to the arrest of former South Lake Tahoe Mayor Terry Trupp and more 
than 20 others.

PARENTS' ROLE STRESSED AT LATINO EDUCATION HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYDIA RAMOS and JEAN MERL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 parents, educators and business and community leaders from Los 
Angeles County and beyond turned out Tuesday for a federal hearing on ways to 
improve the educational track record for Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
Many sought funds for specialized programs, bilingual teachers, anti-dropout 
projects and new schools and updated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But the dominant theme of the hearing, the last held on a five-city tour by 
President Bush's Task Force on Hispanic Education, was parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"Data has repeatedly shown that parental participation is the most critical 
factor behind the achievement of high levels of academic performance among all 
age categories and ethnic groups," U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos 
said in opening the hearing at the county Office of Education in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Cavazos, the first Mexican-American to hold a Cabinet-level post, 
angered Latino leaders by saying parental attitudes are responsible for many of 
the achievement problems of Latino students, including a high school dropout 
rate nearing 40%. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, noting that Latino youngsters will represent 20% of the school-age 
children in the United States by the year 2080, Cavazos said, "The future 
prosperity of cities like Los Angeles depends on how well we educate our 
children," especially those most likely to founder in the present public 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, Hispanic students are a disproportionately large part of this at-risk 
category," Cavazos said, adding that the problem becomes more urgent as the 
proportion of young Latinos entering the work force continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, Latino students make up nearly 50% of all public school 
students. In the giant Los Angeles Unified School District, the proportion is 
62%, or 372,221 students. About 55% of the 18,131 who dropped out of the class 
of 1989 were Latinos, according to Supt. Leonard Britton. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who do not value education will find not the 'American Dream' but the 
harsh reality of limited opportunities and frustrated hopes," Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gabriel Alvarez, a parent who serves on a school district advisory 
committee, said Latino parents want to participate but often are made to feel 
unwelcome or feel they do not speak English well enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish community is being offended by Dr. Cavazos' saying they don't want 
to participate. They would like to," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she did not testify, Sylvia Corona, a mother of three who works a 
swing shift and volunteers at Belvedere Elementary and Belvedere Junior High 
schools, attended the hearing with other East Los Angeles mothers "because I 
want to be involved. . . . I want a better education for my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart E. Gothold, superintendent of the county education office, said schools 
have a responsibility "to make all parents welcome." 
</P>
<P>
City School Supt. Britton, in seeking federal dollars, told the 10-member task 
force that "parent-education programs are critical. . . . (Parents) are the 
most important models for Hispanic young people." 
</P>
<P>
And Board of Education member Leticia Quezada said Cavazos' remarks about 
Latino parents not putting a high value on education "were a literal slap in 
the face to those parents that are trying, that are learning English and 
meeting with the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Quezada and others testifying Tuesday agreed with Cavazos that it is important 
for students -- and their parents -- to learn English without losing their 
ability to speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos said testimony from Tuesday's hearings -- which were expected to last 
into the evening -- will be added to that gathered in San Antonio, Chicago, 
Boston and Miami. It will form the basis of a report that he hopes will be the 
"blueprint for positive action . . . to improve the educational quality" for 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to send the report to the President by the end of the 
summer.

SUPERVISORS TO APPEAL REDISTRICTING RULING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CONSERVATIVES WANT TO CONTEST JUDGE'S FINDING THAT LATINOS WERE 
UNFAIRLY DENIED REPRESENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to appeal a historic 
court ruling that they intentionally discriminated against Latinos in drawing 
their district boundaries in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
With the board splitting along ideological lines, the conservative majority 
voted to continue the two-year legal battle that has cost the county $3 million 
in attorneys' fees. Supervisor Ed Edelman abstained and fellow liberal 
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn left the closed-door meeting before the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to file an appeal," board Chairman Pete Schabarum declared after 
the hour-long session in which county attorneys briefed the supervisors about 
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's ruling Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This man (Kenyon) has embarked on a road of exerting extraordinary personal 
bias that is nothing more than an attempt to rewrite the Voting Rights (Act)," 
Schabarum said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's 131-page decision came just one day before elections in two of the 
five supervisorial districts. Kenyon found that the board violated the Voting 
Rights Act in 1981 by drawing district lines in a way that diluted Latino 
voting power. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the plaintiffs -- the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- plan to ask the judge at a 
hearing Thursday to throw out the results of Tuesday's election. They also want 
district lines redrawn immediately and a special election held by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge sets aside the election results, county officials said privately 
they would seek a stay of his order and pursue the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The judge scheduled Thursday's hearing to discuss possible remedies for the 
discrimination that he says has denied Latinos representation on the board. 
</P>
<P>
In the regular board meeting Tuesday, Supervisors Hahn and Edelman urged the 
rest of the board to settle the lawsuit by expanding the panel to seven or even 
nine members. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's ruling had recommended that the board consider expanding the board, 
though he stopped short of finding that it was necessary under the law. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said there should be one supervisor for each million residents of the 
county. With the population now pushing 10 million, Hahn said, "It's time for 
at least nine supervisors. . . . Let the people decide." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor argued that with a nine-member board, black, Latino and Asian 
communities could all be represented on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said considering expansion of the board "is premature." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see how this plays out," he said, referring to Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Other supervisors were more outspoken in their opposition to settling the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to bet, if (Kenyon) doesn't like the outcome, he'll consider 
dumping the election on Thursday and come out with another hot flash," said 
Schabarum, who was joined in voting to appeal by fellow conservative 
Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conservative majority still opposes expansion, the board delayed a 
vote on the matter for a week. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Kenyon said the judge would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys would not specify their grounds for appealing to the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals or the timing of such action. 
</P>
<P>
"The board authorized attorneys to appeal when it is appropriate," said County 
Counsel DeWitt W. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the three-month trial, which ended in April, county attorneys argued 
that the 1981 redistricting was an effort by the board's conservative majority 
to keep control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
But, Kenyon ruled: "It is undeniable, however, that the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors knew that by adopting the 1981 redistricting plan, they 
were further impairing the ability of Hispanics to gain representation on the 
board. The court finds no legal justification for this form of discrimination 
based on the protection of supervisorial incumbencies." 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys also argued that the existing boundary line splitting heavily 
Latino neighborhoods in East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley does not 
dilute the Latino vote. They said that a Latino district could not be created 
there because many Latino residents are not citizens or old enough to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The county attorneys also argued that the plaintiffs' case depends on the use 
of non-citizens to establish a district in which a majority of voters are 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
John McDermott, a private attorney hired by the county, argued during the trial 
that under that concept, "The moment that somebody comes across the border, 
legally or illegally, that person is entitled to affect the distribution of 
political power in this community." 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said district lines should be drawn based on numbers of Latino 
citizens, not residents. "We regard political power as fundamental to U.S. 
citizenship," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
During the board's regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday, Antonovich called the 
ruling a "slap in the face" to the 10 candidates running for the 1st District 
seat being vacated by Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
"The raw exercise of judicial activism exhibited by Judge Kenyon is contrary to 
all case law," Antonovich said.

COURT BAILIFF SLASHED BEFORE RAPE-KIDNAP CASE HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A raucous struggle broke out inside a Los Angeles Municipal Court lockup 
Tuesday when a defendant in a kidnaping-rape case allegedly drew a crude knife 
on a bailiff. The court official was wounded in the face before other bailiffs 
wrestled the prisoner to the floor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the bailiff, Deputy Los Angeles County Marshal Richard Duran, and the 
inmate, Paul Garcia, were hospitalized at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Both Duran, a 16-year veteran of the county Criminal Courts, and Garcia, who 
was apparently hurt in the scuffle with bailiffs, were reported in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
A second bailiff, Deputy Marshal Don Dutton, suffered minor injuries in the 
scuffle and was treated at the hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is one of three defendants in a preliminary hearing that began Monday. 
The three are accused of 113 felony counts -- including rape and kidnaping -- 
after they allegedly kidnaped and held two immigrant women against their will 
in a camper for several months. They have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Marshal's Capt. Morris Seidner said Duran was apparently taking the prisoner, 
who uses the names Paul Garcia and Richard Gonzalez, from a lockup cell to 
court when Garcia pulled a knife. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as attorneys, interpreters and a Times reporter waited in 
the courtroom for the proceedings to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Glenette Blackwell had not yet taken the bench when the sounds of 
scuffling, screams, moans, heavy breathing and shouts could be heard from the 
lockup area. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a knife!" a man was heard to scream. 
</P>
<P>
Frantically, the judge and others in the courtroom began telephoning for 
assistance. Garcia's aunt, who was seated in the courtroom, screamed, "Paulito! 
Paulito!" 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, dozens of sheriff's deputies, bailiffs and Los Angeles police 
officers swarmed the downtown courtroom, each rushing in and out of the lockup, 
shutting and locking the door behind them, then reemerging to demand more help. 
</P>
<P>
"Call the paramedics," someone shouted from behind the closed door of the 
lockup. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Marshal Dominick Delio, apparently one of the first to reach Duran, 
described part of what happened. He and two other bailiffs entered the lockup 
and found Duran slumped in a corner with blood covering his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Dicky D. (Duran) shouted, 'He's got a knife.' So we just rushed him (the 
inmate). . . . When you see a deputy just lying there, the mass of blood, what 
are you going to do? . . . He (Garcia) was fighting all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Delio said the knife, which he saw on the floor, appeared to have been 
fashioned inside jail. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good one," Delio said. "Looked like a razor blade with a handle." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the knife was smuggled into the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Seidner said people in custody are always searched before being taken to court, 
but added that such procedures are "not an exact science." The incident is 
being investigated, the marshal's captain added. 
</P>
<P>
Delio later said he never saw a knife in Garcia's hand. But Seidner said it had 
been determined that it was Garcia who attacked Duran. Court officers said they 
believed that the only other people in the lockup at the time were Garcia's two 
female co-defendants, who one witness said stood frightened and huddled next to 
each other in the aftermath of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
From the courtroom, a reporter could see a man in County Jail blue overalls -- 
presumably Garcia -- on the floor in the corner of the lockup with several 
deputy marshals on top of him. Splotches of blood covered the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Eleazar Carrasco, an interpreter who was trained as a doctor in Mexico, was 
rushed into the lockup before paramedics arrived. Carrasco said the bailiff 
suffered a deep cut on his cheek and others on his forehead and along his 
jawbone, but that none of the wounds severed an artery. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics arrived and administered emergency first aid. Duran was eventually 
wheeled out on a gurney, his head wrapped in blood-soaked white bandages. 
Garcia was taken out a few minutes later, with bandages on his face and ribs. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys and interpreters participating in the hearing, meanwhile, were 
ushered into a neighboring courtroom where another judge, Patti Jo McKay, 
continued the preliminary hearing until today. Blackwell was apparently too 
upset to continue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Courtroom regulars said they had never seen anything quite like Tuesday's 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pretty severe," Seidner said. "We've had people attempt to escape 
before, punches thrown. But this was truly life-threatening. This wasn't a 
knock-down-and-try-to-run. This was (someone) trying to do grievous injury."

L.A. DETECTIVE IN SECRET UNIT DEFENDS KILLING BANK ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending his role in a 1982 shooting that left one bank robber dead and 
another wounded, an undercover Los Angeles police detective testified in 
federal court Tuesday that he fired his shotgun at the robbers because he 
believed that they were armed and ready to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Michael Sirk, a member of the department's Special Investigations 
Section, told the jury that bank robbers Jane Berry and John Crumpton refused 
to surrender despite orders to do so from him and three other officers, all of 
whom were armed with shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
He said he heard Crumpton -- whom he mistakenly thought had a gun -- yell to 
Berry, "Don't give up!" Then, he said, he saw Berry reach for her weapon: "She 
grabbed the gun with her right hand and withdrew it from her waistband, almost 
all the way out. She looked in my direction." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Victoria Chaney asked Sirk if he was concerned for his 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, very much so," he replied. "I thought she was going to shoot me. . . . I 
redirected my line of fire from Mr. Crumpton to Ms. Berry and I fired my 
shotgun twice." 
</P>
<P>
Sirk's testimony came during the second week of an unusual trial in which he 
and five other retired and current SIS officers face allegations that they 
violated Berry's civil rights when they wounded her and killed Crumpton after 
watching the pair rob a Burbank branch of Security Pacific Bank on Sept. 15, 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The SIS is a surveillance squad that gathers evidence against dangerous 
criminals, often by watching them commit crimes and attempting to arrest them 
afterward. The $10-million civil case is the first time members of the unit, 
which was so secret that few knew of its existence until a 1988 Times 
investigation, have been brought to trial as a group. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's lawyers maintain that the SIS officers -- who shadowed the couple for 
17 days before the robbery -- used excessive force during the shooting and 
could have prevented the incident had they arrested the couple before the 
robbery on lesser charges, including outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
But retired Lt. Dale Ostrom, former head of the SIS who was responsible for 
ordering the surveillance, testified Tuesday that even if he had known Berry 
could have been arrested for a parole violation, he would not have done 
anything differently. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me," Ostrom said, "that the only way to identify these people 
was to get some good eyewitness testimony as to the perpetrators of these 
robberies." 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination by Berry's lawyer, Stephen Yagman, Ostrom disclosed 
that SIS officers watched Berry and Crumpton purchase drugs on at least one 
occasion before the bank robbery. But rather than arrest them, Ostrom said, the 
unit turned the information over to the LAPD's narcotics division. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the aim of this investigation to assist Detective (William) Stewart in 
a bank robbery investigation," the lieutenant testified, "and that's what we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the robbery-homicide detective who initiated the investigation, 
testified Monday that he asked for the help of the SIS because he suspected 
Berry and Crumpton of robbing a bank on Glendale Boulevard in Silverlake but 
could not prove it because they were disguised in masks and wigs. 
</P>
<P>
He told the jury that he believed Berry and Crumpton had committed three 
additional bank robberies on days when the SIS was not watching them. 
</P>
<P>
But under questioning by Chaney, Stewart maintained that he was not certain 
that Berry and Crumpton were the robbers he was looking for. "I did not know 
for sure," he said. "I had suspicions . . . but I did not know explicitly that 
they were the ones." 
</P>
<P>
The trial before U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson is expected to conclude 
this week.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FIRES ON OFFICER AT CLOSE RANGE, MISSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank police officer narrowly escaped death when a gang member fired a gun 
at him from close range, so close that the officer's face was burned by 
gunpowder, authorities said Tuesday. The bullet missed. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Brent Ambrose, 27, was treated for burns on his face and forehead after 
the 11:45 p.m. incident Monday at an apartment complex in the 600 block of East 
Angeleno Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Miller, 24, a reputed gang member who barricaded himself in an 
apartment where he allegedly had attempted to rob three women, later 
surrendered and was charged Tuesday with attempted murder of a police officer, 
assault and attempted robbery, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said Ambrose crouched down at the moment Miller fired a gun at him 
from about three feet away. "The bullet went right over his head," Goldberg 
said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : CITY COUNCIL ADOPTS $3.67-BILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council formally adopted a $3.67-billion budget Tuesday, 
giving unanimous approval to a record spending blueprint that includes nearly 
$60 million in new taxes and abandons plans for 403 new police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The budget for fiscal year 1990-91, which takes effect July 1, emerged from a 
series of council revisions and a formal review by the mayor with relatively 
few confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had sought to increase the size of the Police Department to a record 
8,717 people, but he acceded to requests from the council and Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates to forgo that plan and use the money for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The only Bradley veto of council changes involved a technical item on funding 
for a proposed Fire Department program to have specially trained firefighters 
rather than paramedics handle routine medical dispatches.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : COALITION CALLS FOR SURVEY OF INDIAN SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unlikely coalition of suburbanites and Indians appeared before the city 
Building and Safety Commission Tuesday to demand that an archeological survey 
precede construction of an office building near the site of the "Lost Village 
of Encino," a major Ventura Boulevard dig discovered in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But when developer Maurice Cohen said he would voluntarily survey his property 
to avoid delays, slow-growth activist Gerald Silver declined the offer and 
called for a full environmental review -- drawing laughter from other builders 
who contend Silver's goal is stopping development, not preserving Indian 
relics. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour of testimony, the commission continued its hearing for two weeks 
to enable the city Planning Department's environmental review committee to 
study the case and say whether an ecological survey is needed.

PAIN DELAYS TESTS ON MICHAEL JACKSON; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITIES: NEW CHEST DISCOMFORT CALLED A 'TEMPORARY SETBACK' FOR HOSPITALIZED 
POP STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pop superstar Michael Jackson remained hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday 
after renewed complaints of chest pains prompted his doctor to delay 
administering scheduled tests. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Grammy-winning singer was taken to St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center in Santa Monica on Sunday evening after experiencing chest 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
His doctor said Jackson had a "temporary setback" Monday when he experienced 
more pain. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the entertainer rested comfortably in his hospital room while under 
the observation of his doctor, cardiologist Mark Zatzkis, said Bob Jones, 
Jackson's publicist. The singer was expected to begin the testing process late 
Tuesday or today, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Before being hospitalized, Jackson had been rehearsing and following his normal 
routine of fasting, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who spoke to Jackson briefly Tuesday, said the singer seemed to be in 
good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is a positive person and his spirits are never low," Jones told reporters 
outside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
However, the publicist added that Jackson has experienced a great deal of 
stress recently. He said the stress stems, in part, from the deaths of his 
grandmother and entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., a close friend. In addition, 
Jackson is under pressure to finish an album that is eight months overdue, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson began his musical career as the lead singer of the Jackson 5, which 
produced numerous hits for Motown. The singer eventually went solo and, in 
1979, released "Off the Wall," which sold 12 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the album "Thriller," released in 1983, that placed Jackson on the 
musical map. That work generated numerous Top 10 singles and Grammy awards and 
became the largest-selling album in the history of recorded music.

COUPLE GIVE UP LICENSE IN FOSTER CARE ABUSE CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN: WHITTIER MAN IS ACCUSED OF MOLESTING 2 GIRLS. HE AND WIFE PROCLAIM 
INNOCENCE AND COMPLAIN OF DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Whittier man accused of child molestation and his wife have agreed to give up 
their foster home license. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve and Becky Brown insist the accusations are false and contend they are 
victims of racial discrimination because they are white. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement with the state Department of Social Services, the couple's 
foster home license was revoked and the Browns agreed never to seek 
relicensing. 
</P>
<P>
The couple continued to deny allegations by state social service officials that 
Steve Brown repeatedly molested two black foster children -- sisters who are 
now 3 and 8 -- and that Becky Brown "knew, or should have known" of the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We are innocent and have never done anything to hurt a child," the couple said 
in a written statement shortly after the agreement was announced at a state 
license revocation hearing Monday. "This entire proceeding was initiated 
because some government workers believe that black children should not be 
placed with white families." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Heard, state social services attorney who handled the case, said that, to 
the contrary, the Browns may have received preferential treatment because they 
are white. She pointed out that a Juvenile Court referee granted the couple 
guardianship of the 3-year-old girl last fall, despite unresolved allegations 
of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Heard stood by the state's allegations that the children were molested by Steve 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"We did an investigation," she said, "and we found the allegations to be 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of molestation in the complicated case were first made in February, 
1989, when the sisters were removed from the Browns' foster home after medical 
examinations indicated they had been sexually abused. The Browns and the girls' 
relatives accused each other of the molestations. Police investigated, but no 
one has been criminally charged. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Los Angeles County Juvenile Court Referee Elizabeth Horowitz put the 
3-year-old girl back in the custody of the Browns, despite warnings from a 
county children's services worker that the child might be in danger there. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz placed the 8-year-old with the girl's relatives, and the child 
allegedly told authorities that Steve Brown had molested her repeatedly when 
she lived in the home. Based on those accusations, the Browns' foster home 
license was suspended April 18 and the 3-year-old girl was removed. 
</P>
<P>
State officials subsequently accused Steve Brown of also molesting the 
3-year-old when a new medical examination indicated that the child had been 
suffering sexual abuse, according to a county report. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns face a challenge to their guardianship of the 3-year-old at a closed 
Juvenile Court hearing Friday. A hearing to decide whether to place the child 
under court supervision is scheduled for June 11. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Juvenile Court Referee Elisabeth Krant, who took over the case 
from Horowitz, has been allowing Becky Brown unsupervised visits with the 
3-year-old girl for eight hours a day, three times a week. State officials 
complain that under the arrangement the child might be dissuaded from giving 
information regarding the alleged molestations. 
</P>
<P>
Both Krant and Horowitz have declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns' two-page hand-written statement lashed out at the county foster 
home program as "a system that does not protect the best interests of 
children." The couple also complained of legal expenses connected with the case 
and maintained that they wanted to protect the children from publicity and from 
giving duplicate testimony in the revocation hearing and the Juvenile Court 
proceedings.

COLUMBIA S&amp;L CHIEF HITS PREDECESSOR'S JUDGMENT; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: EDWARD HARSHFIELD TELLS SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE INSOLVENT INSTITUTION'S 
TROUBLES DATE BACK LONG BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF JUNK BONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an unusually scathing speech, the new head of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan on 
Tuesday ripped the regime of former Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel, saying 
Spiegel and other executives placed the insolvent thrift "in harm's way" by 
their actions over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not hindsight. It's not Monday morning quarterbacking. The evidence 
was as visible then as it is now," said Edward G. Harshfield, who took over as 
Columbia's chief executive three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Harshfield's speech to the Beverly Hills thrift's annual shareholders meeting 
clearly took Columbia stockholders and employees by surprise. It was the first 
public sign that a schism has developed between Harshfield and the 
controversial Spiegel, who left as Columbia's chief executive on Dec. 31 amid 
growing losses caused by problems in the thrift's huge portfolio of risky, 
high-yield junk bonds. Those bonds, worth about $3 billion now, have lost about 
$1 billion in value over the past year and now are for sale. The thrift is now 
in danger of being seized by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Harshfield's speech also was unusual if for no other reason than that Spiegel 
and his family still control Columbia, although their grip has weakened because 
regulators are now heavily involved in decision-making. Spiegel sat in the 
front row during the meeting but did not speak. His father, Abraham, presided 
over the meeting as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Harshfield, who did not mention Thomas Spiegel by name, took issue with the 
conventional explanation that Columbia's problems are primarily due to 
accounting changes stemming from the requirement in last year's thrift bailout 
law that thrifts must sell their junk bonds by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the junk bonds mature after 1994, accountants are requiring 
Columbia and other thrifts to constantly revalue their bonds to current market 
prices. Because the junk bond market has collapsed over the past year, Columbia 
has had to realize huge losses on the value of its bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But Harshfield said Columbia's problems were emerging as far back as late 1986, 
long before the junk bond market collapsed and Congress required thrifts to 
sell their bonds. Earnings, he noted, slipped steadily from $193 million in 
1986 to $119 million in 1987, $65 million in 1988 and finally a huge 
$591-million loss last year. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions for loan losses more than quadrupled in the same period while 
expenses doubled, Harshfield said. Columbia's junk bonds clearly declined in 
value over the years, and the losses were compounded by problems with its 
commercial real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Columbia didn't have to continually revalue its bonds to their market 
value, many of the issuers defaulted or Columbia suffered other actual losses 
on the portfolio, Harshfield said. The need to recognize those losses would 
have wiped out virtually all of Columbia's shareholder value anyway, Harshfield 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that all but about $17 million in stockholder equity was 
wiped out, not by government action, but by the business judgments and 
management actions over those several years," Harshfield said. He estimated 
that only 3% of the loss in stockholder value can be blamed on the newer 
accounting methods. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remained jovial at the meeting, Spiegel clearly was bothered by the 
remarks and defended his 13-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed has been here for three months. He has his perspective of the situation 
being here three months. I have my perspective being here 13 years," Spiegel 
said after the meeting.

QINTEX ENTERTAINMENT TO SELL VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a deal that would effectively put it out of business if approved, Qintex 
Entertainment Inc., the bankrupt television production and distribution 
company, announced on Tuesday a plan to sell off assets worth more than $65 
million in two separate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the first deal, the company's entertainment holdings, including Hal Roach 
Studios Inc., the television miniseries "Lonesome Dove" and 1,000 other library 
titles and future development projects, would be sold to RHI Entertainment 
Inc., a television production company in New York, for $42.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the second deal, Qintex would sell its interest in HR Broadcasting Co. to 
ABRY Communications in Boston for more than $40 million. The transaction would 
return $23 million to Qintex after debts are paid. HR Broadcasting owns 
television stations WTTO in Birmingham, Ala., and WCGV in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"We think, given the market for these types of assets . . . the result is as 
good as can be expected, and in the interest of everybody involved," said 
Qintex President Jonathan Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex has continued to operate with a staff of about 50 since its bankruptcy 
filing last October. Lloyd said the staff would probably remain until the 
reorganization occurs. At that point, Qintex would essentially become a shell 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after 
failing to pay MCA Television Ltd. $5.9 million owed under a film distribution 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The company's financial woes started when Qintex Australia Ltd., which owns 43% 
of Qintex Entertainment, failed in a bid to buy MGM/UA Communications Corp. for 
$1.5 billion last October. That deal collapsed after Qintex Australia could not 
attain the funding for a $50-million down payment. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for selling Qintex's assets was reached in an arrangement with the 
Beverly Hills-based company's creditors and investment bankers Donaldson, 
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. All plans must ultimately be approved by the bankruptcy 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the Qintex announcement, it was disclosed that New Line 
Cinema Corp. and Chemical Banking Corp. plan to purchase an interest in RHI 
Entertainment. Chemical Bank will provide the bank loan to purchase the Qintex 
assets, and New Line will invest $7.5 million in the company.

Two Sentenced for Money Laundering: U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi 
sentenced Jose O. Lopez, a former supervisory officer of Security Pacific 
National Bank's central cash vault, to 46 months in prison for conspiring to 
launder $364,000 that he believed was proceeds of narcotics trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the funds had come from an Internal Revenue Service undercover agent 
posing as a money man for drug traffickers. Lopez, 27, of Whittier, pleaded 
guilty to money-laundering charges in February. Takasugi sentenced Geno 
Apicella, 27, of Los Angeles, to 37 months in prison for the same offense.

Gulfstream Developing Jet Noise Reducer: Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. is 
developing an engine noise reduction device that will make older jet aircraft 
quieter and more fuel-efficient, company Chairman Allen Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which will be attached to the rear of the aircraft, reduces engine 
noise by slowing velocity from the tailpipe. Paulson said he has applied for a 
patent on the device, and production could begin in 1 1/2 to two years. The 
device is being designed not only for Gulfstream's older G-II and G-III 
corporate jet aircraft but also for commercial jets.

PIC 'N' SAVE WINS MORE TIME TO FIGHT HOSTILE BID

<P>
The Pic 'N' Save retail chain won more time to resist a takeover threat when a 
federal judge late Tuesday ordered the Girard Partners investment group to 
disclose more information about itself. 
</P>
<P>
Girard, headed by La Jolla financier David H. Batchelder, is trying to gain a 
majority on Pic 'N' Save's board and then buy the company itself or auction the 
chain to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Robert C. Bonner ordered Girard, before resuming its 
efforts to win the support of Pic 'N' Save shareholders, to supply the names of 
its limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, after an all-day hearing, also demanded that Girard file with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission more information about the employment 
history of Robert J. McNulty, a retail executive who is one of the investors in 
Girard. 
</P>
<P>
Under the order, Girard cannot resume soliciting the support of shareholders 
until 10 days after the required information is filed. Bonner also delayed Pic 
'N' Save's annual meeting from June 20 to July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Girard has proposed a slate of nominees, including Batchelder and McNulty, for 
election to Pic 'N' Save's board at its annual meeting. The company has 
countered Girard's efforts by putting itself up for sale, and trying to 
persuade shareholders that it could do a better job than Girard of maximizing 
the value of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save is a chain of 190 stores -- mainly in the West, 
the South and the New York area -- specializing in closeout and other discount 
merchandise.

Stocks lost ground Tuesday on profit taking after the big gains of the previous 
two sessions, when the market hit record highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index of 30 blue chip stocks fell 10.19 to 2,925.00, 
returning about one-third of the Monday gain that put the key market barometer 
at a record 2,935.19. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the drop to profit taking, sharply lower oil prices and a 
weaker bond market. But they said the decline didn't appear to dampen the 
enthusiasm in the market's spring surge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a natural consequence of a straight-up move we've had here for 
three weeks," said Dudley Eppel, trader at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette 
Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues edged out advancers in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 774 up, 813 down and 463 unchanged. Big Board 
volume rose to 199.72 million shares, up from Monday's 175.52 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some market participants said the decline was most likely just a pause. "This 
market is very reluctant to come down," said Jack Solomon, analyst at Bear, 
Stearns &amp; Co. "There's a certain buoyancy here. Even as we correct one 
area, another area can act well." 
</P>
<P>
Oil and oil-services stocks were battered by a drop of 46 cents per barrel in 
the July contract of West Texas Intermediate crude. Baker Hughes dropped 2 to 
27 5/8, Halliburton tumbled 2 3/4 to 46 1/4 and Atlantic Richfield fell 3/4 to 
118 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Some high-tech stocks were hit by profit taking, including Microsoft, off 3 5/8 
to 73 3/8, Cadence Design, down 1 5/8 to 25 3/4, Intel, down 1 3/8 to 47 1/8, 
and Teradata, off 1 1/4 to 26 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks generally were higher, continuing a recent rally. Airline 
stocks also advanced, as oil dropped. AMR gained 1 3/8 to 68 7/8 and Alaska Air 
rose 3/4 to 24 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei index lost 3.75 points, ending the day at 
32,921.62. Share prices ended slightly higher on London's Stock Exchange after 
volatile, heavy trading. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 1.1 
points at 2,380.1. In Frankfurt, the DAX index jumped 19.7 points to 1,876.69.

</P>
<P>
Bonds Fall on News of Lower Oil Prices 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell as investors sold securities to cash in profits after a 
morning rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 5/16 point, or $3.13 per $1,000 
face amount, in light to moderate trading. Its yield, which rises when prices 
fall, increased to 8.45% from 8.42% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bonds gained ground early on reports that Saudi Arabia planned to cut 
the price of crude oil to dealers in Europe and North America, said Kevin 
Flanagan, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. Such a move would be good for the 
bond market because it would contribute to reducing inflation. But the rally 
faded. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other on 
overnight loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Slips Over Interest Rate Fears 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mostly lower in worldwide trading, reflecting continued 
concern about the direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said worries about the effects of a reunified Germany were 
supporting the dollar, but that was being overridden by interest rate fears. 
</P>
<P>
Recent reports showing sluggish economic growth have some dealers worried that 
the Federal Reserve might be loosening its credit grip, they said. Lower 
interest rates often depress a currency. 
</P>

Grain, Soybeans Gain Some Ground 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher Tuesday on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, while precious metals climbed, copper rallied, and livestock and pork 
futures rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures prices were higher and soybeans were mixed on the Chicago Board 
of Trade, with corn futures sharply higher as planting continues to lag. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a report at the close of trading 
Monday that said planting of the corn crop was 88% complete as of Sunday. That 
is less than expected, taking into account that there were several days of 
clear weather last week, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department 
Inc. in Chicago.

SALES OF U.S.-MADE AUTOS DECLINE 3.3% IN LATE MAY

<P>
Late-May sales of domestically made cars and trucks continued a slide begun 
last October, falling 3.3% from a year ago, auto makers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of cars and trucks by the 10 major companies making vehicles in the 
United States dropped to a daily rate of 51,002 during the May 21-31 period, 
compared to 52,767 last year. 
</P>
<P>
A 5.9% drop in car sales nullified a 1.6% rise in truck sales, spurred mainly 
by sales of General Motors Corp. minivans and Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer 
sport-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The drop would have been steeper if the Japanese companies that are making cars 
in the United States -- known as transplants -- hadn't reported more than half 
their May monthly figures in the final 10-day period, said analyst Dave Healy 
of Barclays Bank of New York. He called it a reporting quirk. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Toyota Motor Corp. said it sold 17,938 North American-made cars 
during the first two reporting periods of the month and 19,951 in the last 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Late-May sales of cars made in North America by GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. 
fell 10.3%, while sales of cars made by Japanese companies in the United States 
rose 23%. For all of May, U.S. companies reported a 7.8% decline in car and 
truck sales. With imported vehicles included, car and truck sales last month 
were running 7% behind last year's level. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three's share of the U.S. car market stood at 61% last month, down from 
66% in 1989.

STUDY LINKS COMPUTERS TO INJURIES AT NEWSPAPERS

A team of government and university researchers has concluded that there is a 
"significant association" between typing at computer keyboards at Newsday and 
New York Newsday and the incidence of repetitive-strain injuries -- widespread 
occupational illnesses resulting from repeated motions. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong study of Newsday employees, conducted by the National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health and the University of Michigan, found no one 
cause responsible for the injuries. It identified several job-related factors 
-- including workstation design and individual work habits -- as potential 
risks associated with repetitive-strain injuries, or RSI. 
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report issued earlier this year, NIOSH-Michigan researchers 
found that 40% of more than 800 employees surveyed reported symptoms of RSI, 
including pain experienced in hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders or neck. 
</P>
<P>
The study was jointly requested and paid for by Newsday and the Graphics 
Communication International Union Local 406, which represents about half of 
Newsday's and New York Newsday's 3,100 full-time employees. The study, the 
first comprehensive survey of RSI in the newspaper industry, concluded that 
computer-terminal use at a newspaper office presented "a hazard" to workers' 
health. 
</P>
<P>
The Newsday study found that reporters had twice as many RSI cases as other 
groups of employees who work at computer terminals, and that those who typed 
faster, spent longer periods of time typing and took fewer work breaks were 
more likely to get injured. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said some cramped workstations -- including video-display 
terminals, desks, chairs and other equipment -- could contribute to RSI by 
constraining worker postures for long periods of typing. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you just concentrate on workstations and equipment, you will be 
disappointed (in solving RSI problems)," said Barbara Silverstein, the study's 
principal investigator from Michigan. "You have to deal with the pace and way 
work is organized." 
</P>
<P>
RSI is now the leading cause of occupational illness in the United States, 
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1988, 115,400 cases of RSI were 
reported nationwide, representing 48% of all workplace illnesses. Such injuries 
also have been widespread in assembly-line jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Newsday has implemented several of the study's recommendations, said Assistant 
Managing Editor Robert Keane, including creation of a labor-management 
committee for editorial workers and recently launched a training program, 
starting with managers and new workers, Keane said. 
</P>

R. H. Macy: The New York-based retailer said it lost $63.1 million in the third 
quarter, about the same as last year's $64.1 million. Revenue of $1.49 billion 
was essentially flat compared to last year's $1.48 billion. The company said it 
continues to experience only slight sales growth and is trying to restructure 
its debt.

PARTNERS: Primary hostilities in the 58th Assembly District (B1) went to the 
sidelines Tuesday when two Republican opponents played as a team in a set of 
tennis. . . . Sy Alban, an orthopedic surgeon from Long Beach, joined foe Peter 
von Elten, an Orange County developer, in a doubles match. They beat Scott 
Stadler, Alban's campaign manager, and Al Pross of the California Medical 
Political Action Committee, 6-4. Said Alban: "He wasn't my opponent this 
afternoon, he was my partner." Tony Marcano and Shannon Sands

SHOCKING: South Coast Rep's revival of "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de 
Lune" at the Singapore Festival of Arts includes raw language, partial nudity 
and simulated sex. . . . Such elements are almost unheard of in Asia on the 
legitimate stage. But officials simply labeled the play "adult fare" and 
decided not to check theatergoers' ages. Tony Marcano and Shannon Sands

O.C. MAKES IT A GOOD DAY FOR INCUMBENTS 
</P>

<P>
Despite their occasional gripes, Orange County voters appeared to be returning 
two supervisors and most of the other incumbent county officers, including 
Sheriff Brad Gates, to their jobs, according to early election results Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A third incumbent supervisor facing reelection, Harriett M. Wieder, and Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi were also leading, but both faced multiple challengers 
and needed more than 50% of the vote to avoid runoffs in November. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials predicted that voter turnout would be close to a historic 
low in Orange County after their last check at 6 p.m. showed that only 24% of 
the electorate had voted. They predicted that the final turnout would be around 
40%, boosted by a record number of absentee ballots for a June primary. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of enthusiasm for this primary has been the lowest among volunteers 
since I've been in this position," County Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. 
Fuentes said at a party gathering in Costa Mesa shortly after the polls closed. 
"You always want to see people vote as much as possible, but when we don't have 
a heated race on the ticket, the voters don't turn out." 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said a low turnout favors incumbents, and most were leading after early 
returns, including the two county supervisors on the ballot, Don R. Roth and 
Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, Mayor Larry Agran and a slate of his political allies appeared 
headed toward a sweep of the City Council election, but an Agran-supported 
effort to preserve two pedestrian overpasses on Yale Avenue was on its way to 
defeat. Agran was challenged by his longtime council antagonist, Sally Anne 
Sheridan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my victory will mean ratification of the progressive path we have been 
on, a path that sees local government as an instrument for environmental 
protection, to bring about transportation solutions and address social issues,' 
Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), the only state legislator in the 
county to be challenged in the primary, was leading by almost a 2-1 margin in 
the early returns. The conservative Ferguson was opposed by moderate Republican 
Phyllis Badham, who had campaigned on her support for abortion rights and 
protection for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
In the 58th Assembly District, where five Republicans were vying to succeed 
retiring incumbent Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos), Long Beach orthopedic surgeon 
Dr. Seymour Alban was leading Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays. The 
district which straddles the county line is predominantly Republican, and the 
winner of the GOP primary would be a favorite to assume the seat after 
November. 
</P>
<P>
In the Democrats' most contentious race in Orange County, former Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Tom Umberg had a healthy lead over Jerry Yudelson in their battle for the 
Assembly seat representing parts of Garden Grove, Anaheim and Santa Ana. The 
winner will face Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in November. 
</P>
<P>
For Riley, 77, it was his fifth campaign for the supervisors post representing 
South Orange County, which has some of the area's most rapidly developing 
territory. Riley was appointed to the board in 1974 by Gov. Ronald Reagan. He 
was first elected in 1976, and was reelected in 1978, 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Roth also faced an opponent who did not actively campaign. Wieder, however, 
drew four opponents, partly because she was considered vulnerable after a 
losing campaign for Congress in 1988. She also was the target of an 
unsuccessful recall attempt launched after she voted in favor of a development 
in environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, political experts consider supervisors' seats among the most protected 
among incumbents in the county. The three supervisors recently reported a total 
of about $300,000 in their campaign accounts contrasted with less than $20,000 
for their five opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the incumbents represent a majority on the all-Republican five-member 
board. That board voted 3 to 2 in 1987 -- without Roth -- to build a jail near 
Anaheim, prompting area residents to place an initiative on the ballot that 
would require all future jails to be built in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A was losing by a wide margin in early returns, even though proponents 
originally thought it would pass easily. They now admit that the issue lost 
some of its urgency in the past year and residents no longer feel so threatened 
by the possibility of a jail being built nearby. 
</P>
<P>
In statewide races, Orange County was closely watching some of its politicians 
as they tried to reach higher office. 
</P>
<P>
In the Republican primary for lieutenant governor, state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) held a slight lead over Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) in 
early returns statewide. In Orange County, the early returns had Bergeson with 
a sizable lead. 
</P>
<P>
State treasurer candidate Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine was trailing the 
incumbent, Thomas Hayes, in the GOP primary. Buchanan was losing significantly 
in statewide and Orange County results. 
</P>
<P>
In the first-ever election for state insurance commissioner, Huntington Beach 
City Councilman Wes Bannister was leading a field of five Republican candidates 
seeking the GOP nomination for the post. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson and Seymour, both involved in Orange County politics for more than 10 
years, brought anguish to many in the county when they launched their competing 
bids for their party's nomination for lieutenant governor. Many Republicans in 
the county like them both and were distressed at having to choose between them. 
A Times Poll of Orange County voters last month had Seymour leading Bergeson 
slightly, but a third of the Republican voters said they were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the county, the local elections were all but invisible. 
</P>
<P>
All five of the GOP congressmen who represent parts of Orange County sought 
reelection, but none was challenged by a fellow Republican in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
Of the county's seven Assembly members up for reelection, only one -- Ferguson 
-- was challenged in the primary. All of the incumbents are Republican; each 
will face a Democrat in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
In the state Senate, only one of the eight seats representing a part of Orange 
County is up for election this year. It belongs to Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim). 
Royce also has no primary challenger, although he too will face a Democrat in 
November.

BERGESON COASTING TO VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
LT. GOVERNOR: SHE ATTRIBUTES VICTORY TO HER ANTI-ABORTION STAND AND TO OPPONENT 
SEYMOUR'S FLIP-FLOP ON THE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Buoyed by strong showings in Orange and San Diego counties, Sen. Marian 
Bergeson late Tuesday appeared headed for victory over crosstown rival Sen. 
John Seymour in the contest to see who will be the Republican candidate for 
lieutenant governor this November. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) credited her staunch anti-abortion position, along 
with a flip-flop by Seymour (R-Anaheim) on the emotional issue, with giving her 
the edge in the divisive race. But late Tuesday, she quickly moved to downplay 
the issue in light of being chosen as running mate to gubernatorial candidate 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is an abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion is becoming exploited as a political issue," Bergeson said. "We need 
to start stressing more important state issues such as transportation, 
health-care issues, education and the infrastructure of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's victory would assure a woman on each gubernatorial ticket. But she 
said Tuesday that she was unsure if the gender issue would matter. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson also said she intends to turn her immediate attention to the "uphill" 
task of raising more money for her general election campaign against popular 
Democratic incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy. "To show you how important that 
is, I'm going to start tomorrow morning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Legalized abortion was the main difference separating Bergeson and Seymour 
throughout their bitter primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, a Mormon, attacked Seymour for abandoning his anti-abortion stance 
last year after abortion rights activists pulled out a number of political 
upsets in California legislative races. She used this change to attack 
Seymour's character and Tuesday appeared to have carved out winning edges among 
Republican voters in Orange, San Diego, Riverside, and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to that tactic, McCarthy said he believed that Bergeson won because 
the voters "took Marian a little bit more seriously than John as to her 
conviction on the issues." 
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the abortion issue would continue to play a role through 
the general election. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Marian or myself ever saying a word about it, there's no question that 
the issue of choice is a major concern to many California voters. I have no 
doubt that that will be one of the issues that define us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McCarthy, who will be running for his third term, expressed confidence that 
he would defeat Bergeson. He said she would not benefit from a Pete Wilson 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Pete Wilson is going to have any coattails," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour declined comment Tuesday, but said through his political consultant 
shortly before midnight that he would not concede the race because all votes 
had not been counted in Northern California, where he was prevailing in early 
returns over Bergeson.

REGULATIONS: DAVID T. QUEZADA WILL RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS OF ROTTED FLOORS, 
LEAKING PLUMBING AND BROKEN WINDOWS IN A FULLERTON DUPLEX HE OWNS.

The board of directors of the Fair Housing Council of Orange County is expected 
to meet this morning to discuss complaints that their executive director rents 
out a duplex that Fullerton inspectors say is substandard. 
</P>
<P>
Board members were scheduled to meet at 7 a.m. to hear executive director David 
T. Quezada answer the complaints regarding the duplex he owns on Truslow Avenue 
in Fullerton, which was inspected Monday after tenants complained of rotted 
floors, leaking plumbing, broken windows and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really concerned," board chairman Gerardo Mouet said Tuesday. "My No. 1 
priority is to make sure that people don't get any negative ideas about the 
importance of the Fair Housing Council and the services it provides." 
</P>
<P>
The council, a private, nonprofit agency funded by grants from cities and the 
county, works to fight housing discrimination and helps resolve tenant-landlord 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada said Tuesday that until he tried to evict tenants last month from one 
of the three units of his apartment building, he had heard no complaints, 
including from a manager who lived in one of the units. On May 11, the tenants 
in Unit C were given six weeks' notice to move, and one vowed to retaliate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I know my rights and I'm going to get you,' " Quezada said the 
tenant told him. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants from Unit C were being evicted so Quezada could convert the three 
units back into a legal, two-unit duplex, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledged that the third unit, added to the back of the 
duplex, was built without permits and violates zoning codes. Last weekend, 
Quezada tore down some walls and built others to incorporate the space from the 
third unit into the two legal units. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada said that he built the third unit in 1978 while he was a student and 
that he and relatives lived there until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to refinance the duplex but could not get a loan while the third unit 
existed, he said, so he had to move the tenants out. 
</P>
<P>
After he served the eviction notice, Quezada said, one of the tenants 
complained to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The rotting floor, broken windows and other problems in the duplex are 
legitimate complaints for which he takes responsibility, Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems, although mostly minor and easy to fix, look bad because of his 
position, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed. I'm not just David, I'm the Fair Housing Council executive 
director, and I'm sure I'll pay dearly" for the problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mouet said today's meeting will give Quezada a chance to explain to the board 
of directors, which has a contract with Quezada to run the Fair Housing 
Council. (Quezada refused to give the exact amount of his salary, saying only 
that it was in the $30,000 range.) 
</P>
<P>
After recent news accounts over Quezada's code violations, several board 
members have been trying to learn more about the situation, Mouet said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks bad, publicly," Mouet said. "I'm hoping it will be resolved, because 
I think David has done a good job in managing the office. . . . I have hope all 
this will be overcome." 
</P>
<P>
The tenant who complained about the violations has been moved into the front 
unit, formerly occupied by the on-site manager, Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
He will be allowed to live there for two weeks rent free and has been given a 
relocation check for $1,935, Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Fullerton's municipal code, landlords renting illegal or substandard 
units are required to give two months' rent to the tenants to help them 
relocate, code enforcement officer Kitty Jaramillo said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to give Quezada a list in the next few days detailing what 
needs to be fixed at his duplex, Jaramillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada has been making several repairs at the unit in the meantime, she said.

CITY BUDGET PROPOSAL LACKS FUNDS FOR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday night held a public hearing on the city's proposed 
$176-million budget for the new fiscal year that starts July 1. A formal vote 
on the document is scheduled at the council's June 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, described by City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga as being 
comparatively lean, calls for no additional city funds for a new municipal 
pier. The city had previously earmarked $1.6 million from its current budget 
for the pier, but Uberuaga said there is not enough money coming into city 
coffers in 1990-91 to set aside more for that project. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new pier is scheduled to start in November. The estimated 
cost of the new structure is about $12 million, and the city so far has raised 
about $7.5 million. The City Council has voted to hire a professional 
fund-raising organization to come up with the remaining $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget also has no money for Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg's 
plan for rehabilitating the troubled Oak View area of the city. Lowenberg two 
weeks ago urged the council to spend about $500,000 for police and social 
programs in Oak View to combat drug abuse, gangs, unemployment and housing 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on May 21 indicated general support for Lowenberg's proposal, 
but council members now must revise the budget if the money for Oak View is to 
be funded. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the proposed new budget goes for personnel costs, Uberuaga said. "About 
69.2% of the (budget's) general fund goes to personnel," he said. "We have 
allowed for a 5% pay increase for city employees." 
</P>
<P>
No new or increased fees are included in the proposed city budget. But the City 
Council, at a study session earlier this year, indicated it plans to increase 
the city's trash fee because of rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
The current trash fee is $7.50 a month per residence, and the cost to the city 
for the service is $9.52 a month per residence. Uberuaga said it would be wise 
for the City Council to increase the trash fee to $9.52 a month "so that the 
city is not subsidizing this service." BILL BILLITER

MAN FINDS BOX OF EXPLOSIVES IN GARAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
A 73-year-old man found a box full of homemade "firecracker-size" explosives in 
his garage and drove them to the police station, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Monday afternoon roped off Katella Avenue in front of the station 
while investigators from the Orange County Hazardous Devices Squad disarmed the 
small explosives, Police Sgt. Ron Lesovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"There really wasn't much danger, but we wanted to be sure," Lesovsky said. He 
added, however, that the devices "had the potential" to cause harm if 
detonated. 
</P>
<P>
The explosives were made with black powder poured into little glass jars with 
paper wicks sticking out of them, Lesovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whom police declined to identify, said he found the box in his garage 
and believed that the explosives were made by his 17-year-old grandson who now 
lives in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not about to go to Texas and get him for this," Lesovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The man had originally reported the theft of black powder, which he used for 
reloading ammunition, in May, 1989, Lesovsky said. ALLISON SAMUELS and MATT

RAISE IN TRASH FEES VOTED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To offset increasing costs of trash disposal, the City Council approved a boost 
in trash fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The county is raising the dump fee, so we are just passing it on," Director of 
Public Works Don Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly fee for residents will increase from $7 per month to $7.92. The 
increase for businesses will run from $7 to $40 per month, depending on the 
number of pickups. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said it may not be the last time the county raises its rates this year. 
The county increased its prices twice in 1989, and increases were passed on to 
residents. Since January, 1989, rates have gone up more than $1.50 per 
household. 
</P>
<P>
The new rate will take effect immediately.

NIGHTCLUB'S PERMIT REVOKED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Acting on complaints from citizens and the police, the City Council voted 
unanimously to revoke the conditional-use permit under which the controversial 
Mr. Barry's nightclub has operated since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to uphold an April 19 decision by the 
Planning Commission, which voted unanimously to revoke the permit. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said the business, operated by the Self family, was a nuisance to 
the neighborhood because it generated crime, litter, noise and traffic problems 
and violated terms of the original permit. The Self family appealed that 
decision to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Originally approved as a dinner house with a cocktail lounge, the club at 12675 
Westminster Ave. has evolved into more of a disco, and late night complaints 
from neighbors and police calls to the area have soared, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Todd McWhirter, representing the Selfs, said Mr. Barry's is in the middle of a 
self-imposed cleanup campaign that includes adding a self-closing rear door to 
reduce noise and a crackdown on rowdiness in the bar and its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to insult this council by saying that there's no crime in the 
area of Mr. Barry's, but crimes of a violent nature have been drastically 
reduced," McWhirter said. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the presence of a police substation nearby was a 
contributing factor in the high number of police calls to the bar. 
</P>
<P>
But Doug Holland, an attorney representing the city, said, "The Selfs are not 
victims. They have failed to effectively manage their business." 
</P>
<P>
The Self family may now apply for a new conditional-use permit to operate a 
dinner house or take the matter to Orange County Superior Court, said Gary 
Baum, assistant city attorney. JIM TORTOLANO

MEETING CALLED ON DISPUTED BUILDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council asked the developer of an almost-finished apartment building 
to meet Thursday with city staff members and residents angry about the project. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the 11-unit apartment project came to a halt about four months 
ago after a battle erupted among the neighbors, the city and the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard B. Edgar said he hopes a meeting will help all parties avoid a 
costly legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live near the 2 1/2-story apartments say the project overshadows 
their homes, destroys their privacy and reduces their property values. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Feridoun Rezai obtained a permit for the apartments last year, but 
neighbors who live on Myrtle and Corla avenues next to the project did not 
complain until the apartments began to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
After investigating, the city staff learned that 17 property owners never 
received notices of the public hearing at which the permit was discussed. The 
law requires that all property owners within 300 feet of the project receive 
notices. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission on April 30 denied a permit for the project, requiring 
that Rezai either modify the building or demolish it. He appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Rezai's attorney, Joel Ward, said he estimates his client is losing about 
$1,000 each day while the project sits uncompleted. SHANNON SANDS

SCHOOL GIVEN TREE TO REPLACE STOLEN ONE

<P>
Although thieves struck Prospect Elementary School in Orange three times in one 
month, taking mostly video recorders, everyone figured the 4-foot pine tree 
planted for Earth Day last month would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The sun had not even set on the day of the tree-planting ceremony when two 
students saw a man dig up the tree on the school field between the backstops, 
put it into a blue and white full-size pickup truck and drive off. 
</P>
<P>
"The tree was like the straw that broke the camel's back," said Principal Carol 
Stiff. "You can't even plant a tree without somebody stealing it." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find the thief, police detectives were as disappointed as the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel bad for these kids," said Orange police Sgt. Bob Gustafson. "Our 
detectives said, 'This is a shame.' " 
</P>
<P>
The detectives met with the Orange Police Assn., which decided to seek a tree 
donor. They found their philanthropist: a man with the unlikely name of Joe 
Grumbles. He is owner of the Tustin Meadow Nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Grumbles agreed to give the school a $200, 2-foot Brazil pepper tree, which 
will be dedicated in another ceremony at 9 a.m. on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the tree will be planted inside the wrought iron gates of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Gustafson, "Chaining down the tree this time will definitely 
be a consideration." LYNN SMITH

SUPERVISORS DISSOLVE ADVISORY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, the North Tustin Municipal Advisory Council was making 
recommendations, postponing decisions and bickering. This week, the council 
does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
With a unanimous vote Tuesday, the County Board of Supervisors dissolved the 
advisory body, saying it is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Dessa Schroeder, chairwoman of the now-defunct council, criticized the action: 
"To disenfranchise 30,000 people with the stroke of a pen will be viewed by 
many as arrogant and irresponsible." But Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who 
represents part of North Tustin, said voters are not being disenfranchised, 
because they elect the Board of Supervisors to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no obligation under the Constitution to set up layer after layer 
after layer of government," he said. "If you want another layer of government, 
then it's up to you to incorporate or annex to another city." 
</P>
<P>
In early May, the county Environmental Management Agency recommended that the 
county discontinue the council because the park maintenance district that pays 
for the panel faces a budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
North Tustin has been the only unincorporated area with a municipal advisory 
council since the incorporation of Mission Viejo. Other unincorporated areas, 
such as Sunset Beach and Midway City, have advisory bodies that are not elected 
and operate at no cost to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Since they learned of the recommendation last month, council supporters have 
been circulating flyers to drum up support for the council. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton and fellow Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez criticized the flyers, some of 
which were not signed, saying that they had made false claims about the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"They say the council has been a barrier to massive developments," Stanton 
said. "I was always under the impression that those decisions were made by the 
Board of Supervisors, and I don't recall anything like that coming before us." 
</P>
<P>
Four residents, including Schroeder, asked that the council be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Stephen D. Johnson, an original council member, offered to forgive a 
county debt for the lease of office space if that money can be applied to 
keeping the council afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no economic need to cut the council," Johnson said, arguing that the 
true cost is lower than the county estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime North Tustin resident Hans Vogel, also an original council member, 
urged the supervisors to abolish the council and place different people on an 
advisory commission if one is formed. 
</P>
<P>
County staff members will study forming an advisory panel for North Tustin and 
are expected to report back to the board within 60 days. SHANNON SANDS

GATES, BOARD AGREE ON DRUG LOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An anxiously anticipated showdown between county supervisors and Sheriff Brad 
Gates fizzled Tuesday as board members and the sheriff tentatively buried the 
hatchet and agreed to press ahead with the county's program for distributing 
money and property seized in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who has long objected to most attempts to use those proceeds for 
anything other than drug enforcement, attended Tuesday's board meeting, during 
which the supervisors received a report from the county staff recommending that 
the money be spread among a wide variety of law enforcement activities. Some 
supervisors had learned late Monday that Gates intended to be at the meeting, 
and they had braced for a confrontational session. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than object to that plan, however, Gates endorsed it, calling the report 
"well thought out and sound." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were equally deferential, going out of their way to praise the 
sheriff and his department. "There is no question in my mind that you are the 
best, and will continue to be the best," Board Chairman Don R. Roth told Gates 
as the sheriff stood at the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments were in marked contrast to the rancor that has characterized 
relations between Gates and the board for months. Board members have become 
openly suspicious of the sheriff, accusing him of cultivating the impression 
that the drug-forfeiture funds could be used only for narcotics-enforcement 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
It was confusion over that point -- confusion that supervisors say Gates was 
responsible for -- that led to the exhaustive report presented to the board 
Tuesday. The report, written by officials in the county's management and budget 
division, found that other cities and counties use the funds for an array of 
purposes beyond narcotics enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Gates denied that he had ever led board members astray and said 
that he could not imagine how the supervisors could accuse him of it. "I don't 
know where they could come up with that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, there was only one glimpse of the earlier disputes, as Roth 
gently attempted to pin Gates down on his position regarding the legal and 
appropriate use of the funds. When Gates protested he had never suggested that 
funds be limited to drug enforcement, Roth backed away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to open up the previous disagreement of opinion," Roth said. "I'm 
just glad you and I are now communicating." 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite the veneer of good feeling that accompanied Tuesday's session, 
some supervisors remained wary of Gates' pledges to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"The real test will come when there is an actual test of these funds and how 
they should be spent," Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, one of two funds that he 
administers with seized drug assets, has accumulated $10.9 million so far this 
fiscal year, which ends this month. The supervisors have been eager to spend 
that money on any of several one-time capital expenditures, including possibly 
using some for a new county jail. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is under a court order to relieve overcrowding at its central 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has previously said that he had concerns about using the forfeiture funds 
for jail construction, but on Tuesday he was noncommittal. "We will look at 
each individual topic as it comes up," he said after the board meeting.

DEFENSE RESTS IN BROWN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for Anaheim Hills murder defendant David Arnold Brown, accused of 
orchestrating his wife's 1985 killing and setting up his daughter to take the 
fall for the crime, closed their case Tuesday without putting Brown on the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the need?" defense attorney Gary Pohlson said when asked about the 
decision not to have the 38-year-old defendant testify. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've already explained everything." 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the five-week trial, prosecutors painted Brown as a 
cunning manipulator who talked his then-14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon, into 
shooting to death her stepmother in their Garden Grove home. 
</P>
<P>
After his wife's death, Brown collected $835,000 in insurance and then married 
the victim's sister, 17-year-old Patti Bailey, who already has pleaded guilty 
to murder charges for her role in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Pohlson, putting on two days of defense, hoped to show the Orange County 
Superior Court jury that the prosecution's case was built on lies by both 
Cinnamon Brown and Patti Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
Because of scheduling difficulties, attorneys will not give their closing 
arguments in the case until Tuesday. The jury will then consider whether Brown 
should be found guilty of murder and thus face life in prison without the 
possibility of parole.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A political newcomer who campaigned on a promise to revitalize an aging section 
of Capistrano Beach took the lead Tuesday night among seven City Council 
candidates, preparing to unseat at least one of three incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Lloreda, a 43-year-old homemaker and president of the Capistrano Beach 
Community Assn., appeared headed for victory in this beach city's first council 
election since it was incorporated 17 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
She was closely followed by Mayor Eileen Krause and Councilman Mike Eggers. 
Incumbent Ingrid McGuire was in fourth place, according to early returns. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's election marked the first time that Dana Point City Council members 
faced opposition at the polls since this South County city of 29,000 residents 
was incorporated in January, 1989. Three of the five council seats were open. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, it became apparent that Eggers and Krause were running on 
a slate with Lloreda, the only candidate to hail from that section of the 
6.2-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates repeatedly denied running an official slate. 
</P>
<P>
The three, however, received endorsements from the Coastal Taxpayers, the South 
Orange County Chamber of Commerce Political Action Committee, the San Clemente 
Sun-Post and the Friends of Capistrano Beach, the organization that fought to 
include that neighborhood in Dana Point's cityhood effort. 
</P>
<P>
The major issue in the campaign was whether Dana Point should evolve into a 
major Southern California tourist resort. Eggers, calling himself a 
"destination-point booster," argued that an upscale tourism industry will help 
the city financially by providing tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including incumbent McGuire, called for a virtual freeze of tourism, 
saying that boosting tourism in the only South County city with a recreational 
harbor would kill its village-like flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda and challengers Harold Kaufman, Thomas B. Moy and William L. Petersen 
agreed that another major issue in the campaign was bolstering small business.

CAPIZZI HAS SOLID LEAD, BUT FALL RUNOFF LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi led three opponents in Tuesday's 
race to retain his post, but Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright was 
running strong enough in second place to probably force a runoff election in 
November, according to early election returns. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi held a solid lead over Enright but was still substantially below the 
50%-plus-one-vote total he needs to win the election without a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman and Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef 
were in a virtual dead heat for third place, but both were well behind Capizzi 
and Enright. Still, Freeman and Avdeef were garnering nearly one-third of the 
total vote between them, which increases Enright's chances of forcing a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Enright was jubilant at Republican headquarters Tuesday night. "It's going to 
be a heck of a race in November," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This year is the first time in nearly 40 years that Orange County has seen any 
serious competition for the office of district attorney. Capizzi was appointed 
by the Board of Supervisors in January to replace Cecil Hicks, who held the 
office for more than 23 years and was never seriously challenged. Hicks was 
preceded by Kenneth Williams, who also held the office without major 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi was disappointed that his early election totals did not secure him the 
office. He had picked up almost every major endorsement in the county and was 
the only candidate with a substantial campaign fund, close to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Capizzi was optimistic that he would win against Enright in the event 
of a November runoff. "But it's going to mean a lot of hard work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Freeman and Avdeef said Tuesday night that if Enright does force a runoff, 
they will support him against Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three prosecutors who now work for Capizzi had expected to beat him 
in the June primary. Each had wanted to run a strong enough race to be in the 
top two, hoping to force a runoff. Capizzi, however, had made it clear he 
expected to end the race in June with a decisive victory over the others. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the four showed differing campaign styles. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, 50, relied heavily on his political endorsements and a countywide 
mailer sent to voters. In public appearances, he refused to talk about his 
opponents. Instead, he talked about his record. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, 63, who made a last-minute decision in March to enter the race, told 
voters in speeches that he was the fellow passed over by the supervisors when 
they made a "back-room political decision" to appoint Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 63, a longtime friend and loyal supporter of Enright, touted Enright's 
qualifications as much as his own. Freeman made it clear that he only entered 
the race when it appeared that Enright would not. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef, 48, was the most vocal Capizzi critic on the campaign trail. He lashed 
out at Capizzi over morale in the office, his ties to the county's Republican 
leadership and his refusal to conduct an independent investigation into the 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. scandal.

LAGUNA LIFTS TRAILER PARK FEE FREEZE

<P>
Six months after freezing rents at the city's three mobile home parks, the City 
Council voted Tuesday to lift the moratorium. As a result, residents of Laguna 
Beach's three mobile home parks face rent increases as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
Worried residents who packed the council chambers expressed disappointment with 
the council's 3-0 vote. Council members Robert F. Gentry and Martha Collison 
were absent. 
</P>
<P>
"The city didn't do one thing for the residents of Thurston Trailer Park," said 
Sam Alessi, president of the homeowners association at the park. "We would have 
had that type of increase with their input or not." 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed a month of talks between city staff members and park owners, 
during which the city tried unsuccessfully to negotiate three agreements to 
regulate increases and offer relief to low-income senior citizens living in the 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council endorsed a proposal from the owners of Treasure Island 
Trailer Park to allow a 7% rent increase for one year while freezing rents for 
low-income senior citizens. At the same time, the council extended until 
Tuesday a moratorium that has been in effect since December to allow city staff 
members time to seek a consensus with owners of the other two parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Thurston owner agreed to accept a 6% increase but would not exempt senior 
citizens from the boost. The owner of Laguna Terrace Mobile Home Park agreed to 
rent increases of slightly more than 7% but would not commit to an agreement to 
exempt seniors, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Island residents were notified that if the moratorium was not 
extended, they could expect a 7% rent increase starting today. Thurston is 
expected to impose a rent increase in August, Frank said, but there is no word 
about whether Laguna Terrace plans to raise rents soon. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council followed Frank's recommendation by approving the 
agreements with Treasure Island and Thurston and directed the city to negotiate 
with Laguna Terrace. Council members reserved the right to take further action 
on behalf of Laguna Terrace residents if an agreement is not reached within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was imposed as a result of the dispute between the residents and 
owners of Treasure Island, the largest park in the city. The 27-acre, 
oceanfront park was bought for $40 million in August by Merrill Lynch Hubbard 
and Costa Mesa businessman Richard Hall, who expect eventually to close the 
park to make way for other development.

LIBERALS SHOULD PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an old proverb that says, "A liberal is someone who will put your 
money where his mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
I have a suggestion for all of the liberals who for some reason feel that we 
are not paying enough taxes these days -- particularly those they refer to as 
"rich people" (you know, the friends of Ronald Reagan, etc.) 
</P>
<P>
. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the liberals I hear saying this are a lot richer than I am 
(network anchor people, rich Hollywood types, major media types, various rich 
Democrats such as Teddy Kennedy, etc.), I think that it is high time for them 
to put their money where their mouths are and leave the rest of us alone. They 
can all sit down, figure out how much of their various millions it will take to 
undo all of the terrible things that Ronald Reagan did, make out a check for 
that amount and send it in to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Since they are all among the rich people they claim are not paying enough taxes 
(even though for some strange reason they don't claim to be friends of 
you-know-who), it will obviously give them a warm feeling knowing that they 
have done the right thing and have not passed the burden on to us less 
fortunate people they claim to be so concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
What a wonderful way for liberals to show the rest of us that they really and 
truly do care.

MONORAIL DECISION COULD MOVE BAD AIR OUT OF ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine City Council recently gave the green light to the initial half-mile 
monorail link in a proposed five-mile loop through the Irvine Business Complex 
adjacent to the John Wayne Airport. McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. was awarded 
195,000 square feet of high-rise density in exchange for construction of this 
$9-million monorail segment. 
</P>
<P>
Can you envision walking outside in Orange County and taking a deep breath of 
air without choking on the toxic fumes? This is what we are proposing to 
eventually rid ourselves of: the pollution and congestion caused by hopelessly 
snarled traffic. Imagine taking a short walk from your home to the monorail 
station, quickly up the escalator and onto a sleek space-age vehicle that will 
silently move you in air-conditioned comfort to your office, the airport, 
shopping mall or other places. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of gridlock and being in traffic, you can enjoy reading or contemplate 
the reopened view of nature. We are literally talking about the real quality of 
life here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, let's look at the pragmatic side. Will the proliferation of high-rise 
buildings around John Wayne Airport continue? It certainly doesn't look likely 
that there is any slowdown. I look out my office window and see high-rise 
cranes all over the airport area. 
</P>
<P>
What are they presently contributing to the community besides additional 
smog-belching traffic? Nothing. So one way to view the density bonus that was 
awarded to McDonnell Douglas Realty is to see that there was an equal bonus 
received by the City of Irvine -- a monorail demonstration project that is 
absolutely free to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Was this a fair exchange, just looking at the economics of the deal? I think 
so. The $9-million monorail equates to $46 per square foot of density -- a very 
fair price by any national standard. But, in addition, the developer agrees to 
operate and maintain the monorail until such time as it is donated to a transit 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
This joint effort by the City of Irvine and McDonnell Douglas Realty entails 
some risk as well as vision. As Mayor Larry Agran said at the recent City 
Council meeting, "When we have a proposal that combines the public's interest 
with the private sector's needs and desires, then we have a real project." I 
think he is right. 
</P>
<P>
There is no free lunch or easy way out of our horrendous transportation 
problems. It requires the dedication and the hard work of both the public and 
private sectors to put something like this together, and despite all the 
obstacles, we won. No -- on further reflection, the people won. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it might have been a safer course to "study" the problem for years -- 
as they have in Los Angeles since 1936 -- always waiting for the perfect 
solution. I think we are on the right course. 
</P>
<P>
This train is moving. If we don't look out, it may move some of the present 
lethargy and complacency right out of its path.

SAGA COMES FULL CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And so, 200 years later, the battle for the village of San Juan Capistrano 
continues. The padres fought the wilderness to establish their mission; today 
the villagers fight the developers and politicians to protect the wilderness 
and the village. 
</P>
<P>
Has this saga come full circle? Are the padres and the villagers again fighting 
a concrete wilderness -- e.g., the Franciscan Plaza, traffic signals that don't 
relieve the traffic congestion, meadows and hillsides designated for 
high-density housing tracts, shopping malls and a new civic center that would 
further destroy our environment and mission village? 
</P>
<P>
As more wondrous artifacts are discovered, the politicians voice much concern, 
then proceed to cover them up with monstrous buildings. Should they not be more 
concerned with our quality of life? 
</P>
<P>
Although ours may seem a small conflict, it is significant worldwide, for we, 
as residents of San Juan and citizens of this planet, must learn from our 
lessons of the past to preserve and protect our future.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS SAY 'IT'S TIME A WOMAN WAS GOVERNOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her strong advocacy of abortion rights and the death penalty were big helps, 
but the overriding factor in Dianne Feinstein's historic victory Tuesday was 
that a lot of Democrats just decided it was time to elect a woman governor, the 
Los Angeles Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Women voted for Feinstein by 5 to 3; men backed her more narrowly, by roughly 5 
to 4, according to the poll. But among both sexes combined, four in five of her 
supporters agreed with this statement: "It's time we had a woman governor." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her campaign, the former San Francisco mayor had called upon women 
to "make history" and elect California's first woman governor. She is now 
halfway there, having become the state's first woman gubernatorial nominee of a 
major political party. 
</P>
<P>
Times Poll interviews with voters after they left ballot booths all over the 
state Tuesday illustrated clearly how Feinstein defeated state Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp to become the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, the choice of 
her party to face Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 5,815 voters at 150 
precincts, representing a cross-section of California. Among those interviewed 
in this "exit poll" were 3,210 Democrats and 2,238 Republicans, plus 367 
independents and members of minor parties. The margin of error was 3 percentage 
points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
The interviews with Democrats showed that the most effective issue for 
Feinstein -- besides "it's time for a woman governor" -- was abortion. The 
death penalty also worked well for her. 
</P>
<P>
About three-fourths of the Democratic voters said "abortion should be legal." 
Roughly a similar percentage favored the death penalty. And in each case, these 
voters supported Feinstein with big numbers -- abortion rights advocates by 3 
to 2, and death penalty proponents by 5 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
When asked which issues were the most important in deciding whom to support, 
Feinstein's voters placed abortion and the death penalty at the top of the 
list. Women especially felt strongly about abortion. And they apparently agreed 
with Feinstein's contention that abortion rights would best be protected by a 
woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
The top priorities of Van de Kamp's voters were the death penalty and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
People who considered abortion to be an important issue voted 5 to 2 for 
Feinstein. And those who regarded the death penalty as important supported her 
by 3 to 2, even though Van de Kamp is a career-long law enforcement officer. 
Van de Kamp personally opposes capital punishment, but stressed during the 
campaign that as a public official, he would carry out the death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of Feinstein's first television commercial last February -- a 
30-second grabber that already has become a political classic -- was 
illustrated in the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
That dramatic ad opened with news film footage of the mob scene at the 1978 
press conference when Feinstein announced the assassination of Mayor George 
Moscone, whom she succeeded. Then the narration began, "Forged from tragedy, 
her leadership brought San Francisco together." Inserted into the script was 
Feinstein's personally written description of herself: "tough and caring." And 
the ad concluded with the notation that Feinstein had always been "pro-choice" 
on abortion and was "the only Democrat for governor for the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
On Election Day, when Times interviewers asked voters why they supported the 
candidate they did, the two reasons that worked best for Feinstein against Van 
de Kamp were her "strong qualities of leadership" and the feeling she "cares 
about people like me." She also was viewed as more "dynamic" than Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the reasons that worked best for Van de Kamp against Feinstein 
were his "experience" and the conclusion that he was "the lesser of two evils." 
</P>
<P>
Voters also were asked what they liked least about their candidate's opponent. 
Feinstein's voters were especially critical of Van de Kamp for conducting what 
they viewed as "a negative campaign." Women particularly felt that he had 
unnecessarily picked on her. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's voters thought Feinstein -- who has never held state elective 
office -- didn't "know enough about state government." She was also seen as 
"too liberal," which is ironic because Van de Kamp -- by almost any ideological 
measurement -- was actually the more liberal of the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's public image as a liberal apparently results from long-held 
stereotypes about women and also her being from San Francisco, one of the more 
liberal cities in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals and moderates both supported Feinstein by roughly 3 to 2. 
Conservatives were split about even. 
</P>
<P>
Anglos voted for Feinstein by 5 to 4, but blacks supported her by more than 2 
to 1. Latinos split their votes about evenly. 
</P>
<P>
By religion, Feinstein was supported by Jews 5 to 3, by Catholics 5 to 4, and 
by Protestants 7 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Blue collar workers favored her by roughly 3 to 2 -- and white collar workers 
by the same proportion, an indication of her wide appeal. 
</P>
<P>
She won big among the young and the old alike. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein appeared to have been the winner last month of two televised debates, 
which attracted few viewers but prompted a lot of news coverage that voters 
apparently noticed. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of Feinstein's supporters said the debates "made me change my vote 
for governor." Only one-fourth of Van de Kamp's voters said that. Looked at 
another way, about 3 in 10 voters said the debates changed their minds. And 
these people went for Feinstein by roughly 5 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's backers seemed a bit more committed than Van de Kamp's, based on 
questions to voters about how strongly they supported their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
And Feinstein clearly was the more personally popular of the two. Asked their 
"impressions" of the candidates, 57% had a favorable impression of Feinstein, 
but only 43% did of Van de Kamp.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: YAKEL'S CAREER OPPORTUNITIES KNOCK EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most surprised, it seems, by John Yakel's rapid ascent to the position of 
baseball coach at St. Francis High is John Yakel. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I hadn't planned on it for about five years," conceded Yakel, 24, 
a 1984 graduate of St. Francis. "You set your goals out of college and when you 
reach them in three years, you feel real lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Yakel, an assistant under Tom Moran for the past two seasons, will replace his 
mentor. Like Yakel, Moran was an early bloomer and was hired as St. Francis 
vice principal at 24. Moran, 37, recently was hired as principal at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
"They like to keep their own people involved," Yakel said. "It keeps the 
tradition alive." 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis finished 6-11 overall this season and fourth in the Del Rey League 
with a 4-8 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Record season: Westlake High, which lost in the semifinals of the Southern 
Section 5-A Division baseball playoffs last week, broke 35 school records 
during its 28-2 season. 
</P>
<P>
All-American catcher Mike Lieberthal, selected third overall by the 
Philadelphia Phillies in the amateur draft Monday, owns eight of the nine 
career offensive records set this year and five single-season marks. Lieberthal 
set season records for home runs (13) and runs batted in (43), and holds career 
records in homers (20), RBIs (75) and hits (105). 
</P>
<P>
USA Today officials were at Westlake on Tuesday to photograph Lieberthal, who 
will be named to the newspaper's All-American team at catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Eby, a senior left-hander who will attend UCLA on a partial scholarship in 
the fall, set four season records and has six career records. He owns season 
marks in wins (11) and innings pitched (85 1/3), and career records in 
earned-run average (2.02), wins (23) and strikeouts (153). 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, which was ranked No. 2 in USA Today's national poll most of the 
season and was promoted to No. 1 the day it lost in the semifinals, was dropped 
to No. 19. But USA Today officials told Coach Rich Herrera that the Warriors 
likely will be promoted before the final poll is released in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Hollow doubts: ESPN criticized the Phillies for selecting Lieberthal third. The 
television network joined doubters who claim Lieberthal's 6-foot, 165-pound 
frame cannot handle a 162-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really pay that much attention to it," Lieberthal said. "In a couple 
of years, I'll be at least 20 pounds heavier. I'm only 18. I'm still going to 
grow." 
</P>
<P>
Record in sight: Tum Ratanatraiphob, a sophomore second baseman at Highland 
Hall who stole 50 bases this season, raised his two-year total to 89 and placed 
himself in fast company. He is tied for sixth place on the all-time Southern 
Section list with Lenny Dykstra, the leading hitter in the major leagues and a 
former Garden Grove High player. 
</P>
<P>
With two seasons to go at the Small Schools Division level, Ratanatraiphob is 
almost certain to break the career record of 113, set by Dave McLelland of Rio 
Hondo Prep (1976-80). 
</P>
<P>
Leaps and bounds: Judging by the order of competitors in the long jump at 
Friday's state track and field preliminaries, Marcus Reed of Canoga Park was 
given little chance of qualifying for the final Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the state championships with a personal best of 22 feet 10 inches, 
Reed leaped 23-0 3/4 in the preliminaries and 23-8 in the final to finish 
third. Jerome Price of San Diego University City took first with a leap of 25-3 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Reed is only the third Canoga Park athlete to finish in the top three in the 
state meet in 22 years. Ricco Sanchez won the 800-meter title in 1968 and 
Anthony Bailous was second in the long jump in '84. 
</P>
<P>
Wake-up fall: Creighton Harris of Hoover placed fifth in his heat of the 1,600 
meters in a personal-best 4:14.33 in the preliminaries of the state meet on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Harris had the 10th-fastest qualifying mark and missed the ninth and final 
berth in Saturday's final by 0.28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
He had planned to run in the 3,200 meters instead, but a fall from the top of a 
bunk bed a week before the Pacific League finals in the first week of May 
altered those aspirations. He sustained contusions on his left leg and a 
laceration that required stitches.

Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) was victorious over her strongest 
primary challenger in a decade, defeating Hunt Braly 59.3% to 40.7% in the 37th 
Assembly District race, final vote tallies showed this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Paula Boland handily won the Republican nomination with 
42.5% of the votes in the primary race to fill the seat vacated by retiring 
Assemblywoman Marian W. LaFollette in the 38th Assembly District. Robert 
Wilcox, LaFollette's aide, garnered 33.2% of the Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley voters overwhelmingly embraced a proposal by Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich to built a futuristic monorail line along the Ventura Freeway 
in an advisory referendum on the three most popular rail plans. 
</P>
<P>
The monorail plan received 47.7% of the vote. In second place was a light rail 
proposal with 21.1%, and, close behind, 21% of the voters said they want no 
rail system. Only 10.2% voted in favor of the Metro Rail extension, approved 
two months ago by county transit officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the 21st Congressional District, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
trounced challenger Sang Korman, a wealthy Calabasas developer, winning the 
Republican nomination with 68.4% of the votes to Korman's 31.6%. 
</P>
<P>
In the November general election Gallegly, who garnered 42,255 votes, will face 
Democratic candidate Richard D. Freiman, who received 37,415 votes, and 
Libertarian candidate Peggy Christensen, who collected 315. 
</P>
<P>
In the 37th Assembly District, Wright, who collected 21,469 votes, will run 
against Democrat Dennis A. Petrie, who won 22,203 votes, and Libertarian 
candidate John R. Spooner Sr., with 132 votes. 
</P>
<P>
In the 38th Assembly District, Boland will face off against Democrat Irene F. 
Allert, who won her party's nomination with 64.3% over Gary Crandall with 
35.7%. Peace and Freedom candidate Charles Najbergier won with 37 votes over 
Leah Parker with 27 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Final results of other Republican candidates in the 38th District race showed 
Bob Scott in third place with 13.8%, Hal J. Styles with 5.8% and Al Thomas with 
4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Voters from the Lake Los Angeles area of the Antelope Valley defeated a measure 
55.7% to 44.3% calling for residents to break away from the tiny Wilsona School 
District to build and operate their own high school.

President Bush is "most upset" that a Secret Service agent shoved his senior 
adviser on Soviet affairs when she was lined up in the receiving line in San 
Francisco to say farewell to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Condoleezza Rice was shoved by the agent and told to get behind the rope with 
the lesser VIPs, even though she wore a pin designating that she was a member 
of the U.S. delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is aware of it and most upset about it," White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters. "It should not have happened. The 
Secret Service is reviewing it." 
</P>

Fitzwater noted that reporters have experienced similar situations on the road 
when they are pushed behind barriers. To which one quipped: "Yeah, but we don't 
get the President upset about it."

SENATE BACKS BAN ON AIDS VICTIMS IN FOOD-HANDLING JOBS

<P>
The Senate voted today to allow AIDS victims to be barred from jobs that 
require them to handle food. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ryan White (the teen-ager who died of AIDS earlier this year) was still 
alive and he wanted to go to work for Burger King, this amendment would say 
no," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate ordered its negotiators on the Americans with Disabilities Act to 
agree to a House-passed amendment that would permit employers to move AIDS 
sufferers from direct contact with food to other duties without loss of pay. 
</P>
<P>
Although the provision was primarily intended for restaurants, it could also 
cover supermarkets and food preparation on airliners and luxury cruises. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the instructions, proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) by 
voice vote after refusing 53 to 40 to kill the order to the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Senate instructions to its negotiators are rare and, although no records have 
been kept, Senate historians could recall no time when negotiators were told to 
adopt a House provision. 
</P>
<P>
The instructions are not binding. But they put heavy pressure on the Senate 
negotiators to agree to the House provision. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate and House versions of the Americans with Disabilities Act are 
remarkably similar in other respects, and the negotiators are expected to reach 
agreement quickly. President Bush has indicated that he is eager to sign the 
final product. 
</P>
<P>
The House-passed amendment, aimed directly at AIDS victims and carriers of the 
HIV virus, would also allow the transfer of individuals with communicable and 
infectious diseases that people "perceive" can be transmitted through the 
handling of food.

IRVINE MAYOR AGRAN OUSTED BY SHERIDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was ousted early today in one of several 
down-to-the-wire Orange County elections that forced three other incumbents 
into runoffs. 
</P>
<P>
While Tuesday's primary election drew a lackluster turnout of 38.1%, it 
produced some surprises for Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, Dist. 
Atty Michael R. Capizzi and School Supt. Robert D. Peterson, who will face 
runoffs with their challengers in November. 
</P>
<P>
Voters countywide also soundly defeated Measure A, a controversial initiative 
to locate all future jails in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Supervisors Thomas F. Riley of Newport Beach and Don R. Roth of 
Anaheim were returned comfortably to office as expected, with Roth capturing 
70.6% of the vote and Riley 60.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also returned County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates to a fifth term in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In the county's most bitter race, Irvine council member Sally Anne Sheridan 
edged out the progressive, 12-year council veteran Agran by 860 votes. Agran's 
outspoken support of gay rights, environmental protection and controls on 
growth won him national notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an anti-Agran vote," Sheridan said today, noting that she was 
outspent by her opponent. "I think people were tired of the global versus local 
issues, Agran's use of the city to further his own ends and his undermining the 
city manager form of government." She said her campaign attracted a cross 
section of voters who disagreed on many issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no mandate," she said. "Walking and talking to people convinced them 
to vote for me." 
</P>
<P>
Agran, who watched an early lead turn into defeat, said: "Personally, it's 
difficult. But I do respect the Democratic process and the people have chosen a 
new direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Sally Anne Sheridan in her statements and her literature said I was the issue. 
She relentlessly, and apparently effectively, sought to make me the issue." 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Democrats chose former Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Umberg over 
Jerry Yudelson to run against Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in the 
72nd Assembly District in November. Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays won 41.5% 
of the vote in defeating 4 others for the Republican nomination for the 58th 
state Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
In statewide races featuring local contestants, Republicans chose Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) over Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) for the 
lieutenant governor's race. Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine, the Republican 
candidate for state treasurer, lost the Republican nomination for state 
treasurer to Thomas W. Hayes, the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, the first supervisor in 10 years to face a runoff, will be challenged 
by Joy L. Neugebauer. Capizzi, the first district attorney in more than 40 
years to face a runoff, will run against James G. Enright, chief deputy 
district attorney. Peterson, school superintendent for 24 years, will face John 
F. Dean who captured the slight majority vote.

3,700 SOVIET JEWS LIVING IN ISRAEL'S OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

<P>
The Israeli government has portrayed the influx of Soviet Jews to the occupied 
lands as minuscule, but a survey completed today estimated that more than 3,700 
Soviet Jews are living on land seized from Jordan in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The survey total, which encompasses annexed areas of Jerusalem that are 
excluded by the government, shows the magnitude of the immigration to occupied 
zones is far short of the mass influx feared by the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
It constitutes only a small percentage of the 51,700 Jews who have arrived 
since the Soviet Union liberalized its exit policies in the spring of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of settling Soviet Jews on war-won land has become critical to 
the future flow of immigrants, projected to reach 20,000 a month later this 
year.

China freed 97 pro-democracy protesters, including two student leaders, after 
the anniversary of the June 4 army attack on last year's demonstrations passed 
without major unrest, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The releases bring to 881 the number freed in the last six months, out of 
thousands arrested. 
</P>
<P>
But new arrests have been reported as recently as last week, and the releases 
did not signal a softening by the aging leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the leaders appeared to be trying to put the protests behind them and 
improve their image at home and abroad. China's most-favored-nation trade 
status remains under review in the U.S. Congress, and foreign tourism and 
investment remain far below their pre-June, 1989, level.

Queen Elizabeth is finally showing her age on a new bank note which portrays 
Britain's 64-year-old monarch with a double chin, wrinkles and slight bags 
under her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me look so old," the tabloid Sun newspaper today quoted the Queen as 
telling artist Roger Withington, who designed the new note. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I suppose I am old." 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England insisted the queen had aged gracefully on the turquoise 
note, which updates the one on the old blue five-pound ($8) note and other 
denominations by 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The monarch's profile on coins and stamps also dates from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The new note appears Thursday. It is smaller and, the Bank of England said, 
harder to forge than its predecessor.

A man who paddled a kayak over Niagara Falls in a stunt he had planned for 10 
years was still missing today and officials searched for his body. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Sharp, 28, of Ocoee, Tenn., paddled along the brink of the 172-foot 
falls at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday as dozens of tourists watched, Niagara Parks Police 
Staff Sgt. Fred Hollidge said. 
</P>
<P>
Several tourists videotaped Sharp's 15-story plunge on personal camcorders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our regular patrol is watching the river," Sgt. Jim Dugos said. He said police 
can't dive there to look for a body. 
</P>
<P>
Hollidge said his department had no advance warning someone would attempt the 
stunt. "It took us completely by surprise," he said. "If I had known that, I 
would have made every effort to stop him."

CHRYSLER MAY WANT IACOCCA IN ITS FUTURE

<P>
Chrysler Corp.'s directors, rocked by a series of high-level resignations, are 
poised to discuss this week a contract extension for the auto maker's 
charismatic chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, reports today said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that will be discussed" at Thursday's board meeting in New York, an 
unnamed Chrysler executive told the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Free Press quoted "industry insiders" as saying the 64-year-old 
Iacocca may not retire when his contract expires in December, 1991, but plans 
to keep working until at least 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris could not be reached for comment today but was 
quoted in the Detroit News as saying he knew of no change in Iacocca's plan to 
decide on his future at the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, Chrysler has lost three key figures -- Vice Chairman Gerald 
Greenwald, Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman and Vice President Michael Hammes. In 
addition, the firm saw its earnings slip nearly 80% in the first quarter of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there are important constituencies within Chrysler's dealers, 
employees, the financial community and shareholders that would like to see 
Iacocca stay on," said Jack Kirnan, an auto industry analyst with Kidder 
Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to happen. I think it's very critical to Chrysler's 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the pressure on Iacocca to remain at the helm is his popularity 
as Chrysler's leading advertising spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The News quoted "sources familiar with Chrysler's marketing plans" as saying 
the firm is having difficulty devising an advertising plan that does not 
include Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
The News also quoted sources as saying Greenwald's departure has cast doubt on 
the retirement plans of Bennett Bidwell, the 63-year-old chairman of Chrysler 
Motors.

Upjohn Co. said today it agreed to sell its 100-employee South African 
vegetable seed operation, Asgrow S.A., to local management. 
</P>
<P>
However, Upjohn spokesman John P. Lambrechts said the company is not pulling 
out of South Africa and will continue operating its 150-employee Upjohn Ltd. 
pharmaceutical and animal health products business there. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn shareholders defeated a proposal at the company's May 15 annual meeting 
for its withdrawal from South Africa and sale of interest in any affiliate 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement it remains committed to social responsibility 
and change in South Africa's segregationist government. 
</P>
<P>
Sale of the seed operation was "strictly based on business reasons," Lambrechts 
said.

FRENCH CABINET VOTES BAN ON ALL TOBACCO ADS BY '93

<P>
The Cabinet today voted to ban all tobacco advertising in France by 1993 in 
what would be one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also severely restrict advertising for alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Ads for hard liquor would be allowed only in publications oriented specifically 
toward adults, and these would have to carry a message about the health hazards 
of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
A separate bill is expected to be introduced soon that would raise cigarette 
prices 15% -- the biggest single hike ever in France. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Louis Le Pensac said: "100,000 people die prematurely in 
France each year because of tobacco and excess alcohol consumption. This in an 
intolerable human, social and economic cost." 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, submitted by Health Minister Claude Evin, all direct and 
indirect tobacco advertising will be banned as of Jan. 1, 1993, including the 
sponsorship of sports and cultural events by tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
Even the use of cigarette trademarks as logos on non-tobacco items, such as 
clothing or luggage, would be banned, Le Pensac said. 
</P>
<P>
The law is expected to win easy approval in the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette manufacturers have contended that a ban on tobacco advertising would 
not affect consumption, but they estimate that the proposed price increase will 
lower sales by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the government is a major producer of cigarettes. Through SEITA, 
the government's wholly owned tobacco company which produces such brands as 
Gauloises and Gitanes, it controls about 51% of the cigarette market.

Stock prices posted a moderate loss today, extending Tuesday's pullback from 
record highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 10.19 on Tuesday, dropped 13.35 
points today to 2,911.65.

<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock

Big Board volume totaled 164.02 million shares, against 199.72 million in the 
previous session.

<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell .78 to 199.15. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were cashing in some of the gains from the market's 
recent run-up. 
</P>
<P>
Market participants also seemed leery of chasing after stocks as a few 
misgivings spread about the chances for any further sharp drop in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
A Wall Street Journal article published this morning argued that the Federal 
Reserve didn't appear in any hurry to tighten credit on the basis of recent 
signs that economic growth had slowed. 
</P>
<P>
The story said Fed officials still are inclined to pursue policies aimed at 
curbing inflation, rather than easing credit. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices drifted in a narrow range today as traders awaited more evidence on 
the direction of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at midday as its yield held 
at 8.45%, the same as late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading was very light in the absence of new government reports 
that could indicate trends in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
A report last Friday that showed slower-than-expected growth in May employment 
figures triggered a furious rally that pushed yields on 30-year Treasury bonds 
to a four-month low. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices have changed little since Friday, however, and analysts say there 
are no potentially market-moving reports scheduled from the government this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the government plans to report on retail sales, trade and consumer 
prices, and analysts say those reports could provide a clearer picture on the 
state of the economy and chances that the Fed will encourage lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really incredibly quiet here," said Nancy Vanden Houten, a money market 
economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
She said an economic report "would have to be something that really changes the 
market's view of things before it will move a lot." 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were off 1/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/16 point and long-term 
issues were unchanged to up 1/16 point, according to the Telerate financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
lost 0.15 to 1,159.69.

Amid speculation that he is ready to quit television to run for the U.S. 
Senate, Phil Donahue says don't count on it -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obliged to do the show until 1992, so any political plans I might make 
would not go into effect until the 1994 elections," the talk show host said in 
the June 9 issue of TV Guide. "I'm really very undecided at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year TV veteran, a Democrat, said he wonders "how electable I'd be in 
the age of 'read my lips.' I'm pro-choice. I support gay rights. I think the 
invasion of Panama was a bad idea, and I think we ought to be able to burn the 
flag."

Madonna's infected throat has forced her to cancel another show. She scratched 
tonight's performance in Worcester, Mass., and those with tickets will get 
refunds since the show won't be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Madonna had to cancel a concert in Rosemont, Ill., because of her 
throat problem. . . . Ron Kovic, the Vietnam War paraplegic whose hawk-to-dove 
transformation was portrayed in the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," fell 
ill and had to miss an appearance at Harvard University today. Kovic was to 
have spoken at Harvard's Class Day exercises but a spokesman said he apparently 
fell ill just before getting on a plane in Los Angeles for the trip to Boston. 
The spokesman did not specify what was wrong with Kovic but said it was related 
to his paralysis and probably would have required emergency hospitalization if 
he had made the trip. . . . Paul McCartney didn't like being called greedy by 
the manager of U2 just because he had a corporate sponsor for his recent tour. 
Paul McGuinness, speaking at a music forum last month, denounced McCartney for 
letting Visa sponsor him and also lashed the Who for having a beer company back 
their tour last year, especially since the Who's Peter Townsend is a recovering 
alcoholic. Townsend wouldn't comment, but McCartney responded with an 
eight-letter curse word. "My advice to Paul McGuinness is to grow up," 
McCartney said in Rolling Stone. . . .

There was an interesting threesome at Tuesday night's Dodgers-Atlanta Braves 
game in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Fonda sat in a front-row seat behind the Braves' dugout and on one side of 
her was her boyfriend Ted Turner, the Cable News Network mogul who also owns 
the Braves. On Fonda's other side was none other than her estranged husband, 
Tom Hayden, the California state assemblyman. Hayden didn't let Turner's status 
as the Braves' owner keep him from wearing a Dodgers jacket and cap.

Charlie Rose is leaving the overnight CBS interview program "Nightwatch" for a 
daily interview show on the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
The Emmy winner who has headed "Nightwatch" since it began in 1984 will join 
"Personalities" as its anchorman, Fox announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Personalities" has already been cleared by 115 stations across the country for 
either late-afternoon or early evening airing, and is designed as a hard-news 
companion piece for "A Current Affair." It is described as the "first daily 
syndicated magazine focusing solely on people making headlines" in 
entertainment, politics, sports, business, communications and the arts. The 
program will be broadcast by satellite daily from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who signed a four-year contract with Fox, will finish his reign on the 
CBS News broadcast as of June 15. He will be replaced by a crew of rotating CBS 
correspondents until a permanent anchor is named. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has also been anchorman on "Face the Nation," "CBS Morning News," "CBS 
This Morning" and "Newsbreak."

Country music giants Randy Travis, Loretta Lynn and Clint Black helped lure 
about 20,000 people eager for a chance to rub elbows with stars to the 19th 
annual International Country Music Fan Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Travis attracted one of the largest crowds Tuesday afternoon, with people lined 
up around a building to take a picture with the singing star, get an autograph 
or simply shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
Cameras clicked furiously and the crowd oohed and aahed when a youngster in 
full cowboy regalia was lifted onto a counter next to Black. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary Bingham will be 3 this month and is a big country music fan already, 
says his mother, Sonja Bingham. 
</P>
<P>
"His favorite song is (Black's) 'Nobody's Home' and he puts on his boots and 
his hat along with the words," Bingham said. 
</P>
<P>
Charley Pride also was a hit at the celebrity show-off event at the Tennessee 
State Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Beside star contact, the weeklong fair's $70 registration fee lets fans see 40 
hours of concerts, visit the Opryland USA show park and tour the Country Music 
Hall of Fame and Museum.

STOCKWELL GIVES CREDIT TO LYNCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dean Stockwell, who dropped out of the public eye at age 15 after appearing on 
Broadway and in several movies, found nobody wanted him when he was ready to 
drop back in -- until he ran into David Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
And Lynch, co-producer of ABC's "Twin Peaks," told TV Guide in its June 9 issue 
that he had presumed Stockwell was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Now Stockwell's career is very much alive. He won a Golden Globe award for his 
work on NBC's "Quantum Leap." 
</P>
<P>
Stockwell, 54, first acted professionally at 6 in a Broadway play and was 
signed to a seven-year MGM contract. He made several films, including "The Boy 
with Green Hair." 
</P>
<P>
But he hated the attention and at age 15 dropped out "to become anonymous, to 
disappear," Stockwell said. When he tried to make a comeback, "I couldn't get 
work for a long, long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lynch ran into him in Mexico City while working on a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"This person looked familiar, but (I told myself) it couldn't be who I thought 
it was, and it made me feel a little nutty," Lynch said. "Then I realized it 
was Dean, and he was alive." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch eventually cast Stockwell in the movie "Dune" and later in "Blue Velvet."

MUSTER TOPS IVANISEVIC; GOMEZ BEATS CHAMPION;

TENNIS: THE SEMIFINAL MATCHES ARE ESTABLISHED. FOUR PLAYERS WILL MEET FRIDAY -- 
AND NONE HAS EVER WON A GRAND SLAM EVENT.

Thomas Muster shook off a self-inflicted crack on the shin and Andres Gomez 
silenced an ailing local qualifier and his hometown fans to complete the men's 
semifinal matchup at the French Open today. 
</P>
<P>
Muster, the seventh seed from Austria, beat Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia 6-2, 
4-6, 6-4, 6-2, before Gomez, the fourth seed from Ecuador, defeated Thierry 
Champion 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
They meet for a berth in the final Friday, when American Andre Agassi, the 
third seed, goes against unseeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden. None of the final 
four has ever won a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
Muster beat Gomez in the Italian Open semifinals three weeks ago, on his way to 
winning that clay-court event. 
</P>
<P>
Muster slammed his shin with the racket so hard on one second-set shot that he 
started bleeding and was afraid more extensive damage might have been done. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt pretty bad," Muster said. But it was not enough to affect the outcome 
of this quarterfinal against the unseeded Yugoslav, who eliminated Boris Becker 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching his second Grand Slam semifinal, Muster stayed on the baseline and 
blasted shots at Ivanisevic, who attacked with volleys and dropshots. 
</P>
<P>
It was an effective strategy in the second set, when the Yugoslav came back in 
the late games and closed with an ace. 
</P>
<P>
But it was too little against Muster, who has recovered from a severe knee 
injury suffered when he was hit by a drunk driver in Florida last year to 
become recognized as one of the world's top players. 
</P>
<P>
Muster won the last four games to close the first set, blasted a forehand so 
hard that Ivanisevic couldn't handle it at the net to finish the second and 
flipped a forehand topspin lob over his charging opponent for match point. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard to play against players like Goran," Muster said. "You get 
tired and start to lose concentration. But I made some important shots at the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, ranked seventh in the world and the owner of one of the best clay-court 
games around, was just too much for Champion, the first qualifier to reach the 
French Open quarterfinals since the open era of tennis began in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
It took just 1 hour, 38 minutes for Gomez to reach his first Grand Slam 
semifinal. The 30-year-old, the oldest by far of the four semifinalists, said 
it had been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited 20 years for this moment to come," Gomez said. Helped by the 
first-round elimination of second-seeded Becker and a fourth-round walkover 
against injured Magnus Gustafsson, the 14th seed, Gomez has reached the semis 
without playing a single seed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a bit of luck in the draw," he said. "And even if I don't believe in 
luck, sometimes you want some." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez broke Champion's service in the first game and never was troubled. He 
allowed just one break himself, for 4-3 in the final set, but won three of the 
last four games to close it on Champion's long service return. 
</P>
<P>
Champion, who played eight matches in the last two weeks, said he felt ill 
throughout the match. He also was bothered by a groin strain suffered while 
beating Karel Novacek in the fourth round.

Russ Farwell had a long way to jump, but he made it today, becoming general 
manager of the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Farwell, 34, became the first general manager to leap from junior hockey to the 
NHL in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
He has been general manager of the Seattle Thunderbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Farwell succeeds Bob Clarke, hero of the Flyers' Stanley Cup teams of the '70s 
and general manager for six years, who was fired after the team missed the 
playoffs for the first time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Farwell, a Calgary native, was general manager at Medicine Hat of the World 
Hockey League for six years, his teams winning two straight Memorial Cups. He 
took over Seattle in April, 1988, after the team finished 25-42-2. They 
improved to 33-35-4 in his first year and 52-17-3 in the last season, second 
best in the league.

U.S. SOCCER TEAM INTENDS TO GET DOWN AND DIRTY

Even though the U.S. soccer team went to church today, the theme of the day was 
no more Mr. Nice Guys. 
</P>
<P>
Before taping promotional spots for MTV and visiting the Basilica of the 
Madonna at the Montenero Sanctuary, the team worked out in the rain and talked 
about the need to get tough -- and even play dirty. 
</P>
<P>
"We're too clean, myself included," forward Bruce Murray said. "As a team, we 
have to get mean and aggressive. I know a lot of that comes with maturity on 
the field, knowing when to give up a professional foul if pressed, when to just 
step in and hip check and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Professional fouls? Hip checks? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a matter of retaliating," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said. 
"It's just a matter of asserting your manhood out there, as well. We certainly 
have come a way from (the days when) after a hard play we'd look at the referee 
and say, 'What's going on here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Peter Vermes, likely to start at forward along with Murray in Sunday's game 
against Czechoslovakia, has played in Hungary and the Netherlands and knows the 
way things go. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come over to Europe and start to play as an American player, you have 
to learn in three weeks to a month the tricks of the trade that these players 
over here have been learning for their whole lives," Vermes said. 
</P>
<P>
And what, exactly, are those? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing major where you really hurt someone," Vermes said. "Just get the foul. 
Slow the game down. Begin again." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Murray put it: "Sometimes you have to lay in the heavy tackle and set 
the tone. Let the other guy know that, next time, you're in for more." 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what FIFA, soccer's governing body, is trying to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the intentions are good," Gansler said of FIFA's directive for strict 
refereeing. "But even though you set the guidelines, you still have different 
individuals out there, in terms of referees, that are going to have the 
jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said he prefers strict enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"That might work to our advantage," he said, "because a lot of these teams are 
going to think, 'Let's see if we can intimidate them.' And if they're going to 
try that stuff from behind, well, then we're going to be hopefully protected by 
the referees. If not, then maybe matters might have to be taken into their own 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
After the morning practice, Paul Caligiuri, Desmond Armstrong, Jimmy Banks and 
Eric Eichmann sang for the MTV camera. 
</P>
<P>
There was no singing at the Montenero Sanctuary, set on a picturesque hilltop 
outside Livorno. The church was opened in 1575 and is dedicated to an alleged 
sighting of the Madonna at Livorno on May 15, 1345. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Machnick, the team's goal-keeping coach, said if the Americans advance to 
the second round, he would crawl from Tirrenia to the church as an act of 
thanks.

HOME-COURT EDGE TOO OFTEN TIPS NBA PLAYOFFS OFF BALANCE 
</P>

<P>
Know what I'd like to see? The NBA taking a tip from tennis. It could do 
wonders for its playoff season. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the people who muddy its name, tennis is a scrupulously honorable 
sport. Tennis acknowledges that the largest advantage in its game is with the 
server, and so it requires the winner of a set to have beaten his opponent when 
the opponent is serving. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the most advantageous position in basketball is for a team to be on 
its home floor. Consider the teams that are playing for the NBA championship in 
the series that began Tuesday night at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers were 9-0 at home in the playoffs, but 
both were under .500 on the road. En route to the NBA Finals, each survived a 
seven-game series largely on the strength of its home-court advantage. For 
Detroit, that edge showed in the Eastern Conference finals, when the Pistons 
went 4-0 at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich., and 0-3 at Chicago Stadium. 
Similarly, against San Antonio in the Western semifinals, the Trail Blazers 
were 4-0 at home and 0-3 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Pistons won the finals opener on their home floor. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, home-court advantage was the most important ingredient in four of 
five playoff series that went the maximum: Besides the home-court blessings of 
the Trail Blazers and Pistons, New York and Philadelphia advanced out of the 
first round by winning only at home. Furthermore, only Phoenix had any luck 
among the teams without a home-court advantage, ousting Utah and the Lakers 
before succumbing to the Trail Blazers' home floor and Kevin Johnson's sore 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
All told, home teams are 55-13 in the playoffs. And these contests are best on 
best. Nobody's getting fat off the Kings or Clippers any more. 
</P>
<P>
The finals have gone to the team with the greater number of home games eight 
times in 12 years, including the last four. If the trend holds -- and there's 
no compelling reason to believe it won't, given Detroit's 17-1 playoff record 
at the Palace the last two seasons -- the championship was decided when the 
Pistons won the scheduling tie-breaker with their slightly superior conference 
record. 
</P>
<P>
What causes home-edge disparity is beyond dissection. Some subscribe to the 
IN-YOUR-OWN-BED theory, a doctrine encompassing everything that has to do with 
undisrupted routines. But that doesn't explain how veteran teams, which ought 
to have developed road-trip routines, can be thoroughly unwound by away games. 
</P>
<P>
Others point to the enthusiastic intimacy of NBA crowds, suggesting that the 
home team benefits from the effect of mob intimidation on visitors and 
officials alike. Maybe, but does that reveal how the Pistons could win Games 5 
and 7 of the Eastern finals (at home) by 14 and 19 points and lose Game 6 (in 
Chicago) by 18? Not a chance. After all, it's not Earl Strom's league. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, when I am made Supreme Being of Basketball, the first thing I intend to 
fix is the playoffs. Home-court advantage will remain a useful tool, but it 
will no longer be the preemptive strike weapon it is today. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, given the robust financial health of the league, we'll do away 
with the current 2-3-2 finals format and go back to the 2-2-1-1-1 arrangement. 
After all, it used to be good enough for the finals (until the league, stricken 
by early '80s poverty, got up tight about consuming all that jet fuel), and it 
remains good enough for intra-conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
If someday that means jetting back and forth between Sacramento and Orlando a 
couple of extra times to settle the league crown, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
But here's the czar's historic wrinkle: In the league and conference finals, if 
at the conclusion of any Game 6 neither team has won on the road, Game 7 would 
convene at a neutral site in a predetermined NBA city. That way we'd begin to 
determine champions who have something going for them beyond home cookin'. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, each team has managed to win at least once on the 
opponent's floor, the rotation would continue as usual, and the team with the 
home-court advantage would be the host for Game 7. The czar believes any team 
that "breaks serve," so to speak, and then cannot hold it does not deserve 
having the league intervene on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The czar would maintain the current rotation in the best-of-seven conference 
semifinals and the best-of-five first round. The regular season must stand for 
something, but two rounds of all-important home-court advantage seems about 
enough.

The final 1990 TRC Triple Crown Poll, ranking leading 3-year-old Thoroughbred 
contenders for the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes through 
racing of May 20. The Top 10, ranked on a 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 point scale, is 
based on a national poll of sports and Thoroughbred racing media with 
first-place votes in parentheses, 1990 record and total points. 
</P>
<P>
All in top 10 are colts. This corrects poll published in Tuesday's P.M. Final. 
That survey was not a Triple Crown poll and was outdated.

GARY STEVENS GIVEN 5-DAY SUSPENSION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thoroughbred jockey Gary Stevens, the nation's leading money-winning rider, was 
handed a five-day suspension Monday night by the Los Alamitos stewards for 
failure to maintain a straight course aboard the quarter horse Kite In The Sky 
last Saturday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension dates are this Friday and Saturday (June 8 &amp; 9) and June 12, 
13 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens made a rare appearance at Los Alamitos Saturday to ride Raised 
Toperfection in the $230,000 Kindergarten Futurity -- one of the most 
prestigious events in quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to riding Raised Toperfection, Stevens also was named to ride the 
$5,000 claimer Kite In The Sky. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens and Kite In The Sky finished a close third in the evening's seventh 
race, but the Los Alamitos stewards disqualified the pair and moved them to 
last for causing interference about 100 yards away from the gate. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens went on to finish eighth aboard Raised Toperfection in the Kindergarten 
Futurity.

LEISURE WORLD MANAGEMENT FIRM SOLD; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT OF EL TORO IS PURCHASED BY A 
PRIVATE BALTIMORE COMPANY THAT PLANS TO PROVIDE IT WITH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR 
EXPANSION.

EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Professional Community Management Inc., the firm that oversees the 12,736-home 
Leisure World of Laguna Hills, has been purchased by a Baltimore-based company 
that plans to provide it with expansion capital. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Elkins, chairman and chief executive officer of Integrated Health 
Services Inc., said Tuesday that El Toro-based PCM was "the most important 
part" of a package of business assets it has acquired from Affiliates Group of 
Nashville, Tenn. for $12.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said PCM, which generated revenue of $6 million last year by providing 
property management services for numerous retirement and other communities in 
Southern California, fits well into IHS's business plans. 
</P>
<P>
Four-year-old IHS owns and operates 25 specialized nursing homes and 
assisted-living facilities for the elderly in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
IHS is also eager to expand, and officials said PCM will give the company, 
whose holding are now concentrated in the East and Midwest, its first West 
Coast presence. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said PCM's strong profitability was not its main selling point. "The 
real attraction is the excellence of their management," he said. "The '90s are 
a decade of service in elderly health care, and they give about the best 
service I have seen." 
</P>
<P>
At Leisure World in Laguna Hills, PCM performs all the community's security, 
maintenance, administration and landscaping. It manages the clubhouses, hires 
the recreation staff and operates the community's private bus line. The 
development was designed for retirement-age homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
PCM also provides property management services for other communities in Orange, 
San Diego and Los Angeles counties. It has a contract with the master 
association of Aliso Viejo, a community planned for 25,000 homes that the 
Mission Viejo Co. is developing in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Olsen, longtime chief executive officer of PCM, said he was pleased 
about the buyout by IHS. This is the third time in the last seven years that 
PCM, founded in 1972 by a group of businessmen that included Olsen's father, 
has changed ownership. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, PCM was purchased for $1 million by Johnstown American Cos., based in 
Atlanta. Under that company's ownership, PCM expanded nationally through 
acquisitions and then saw its newly acquired assets sold for cash when 
Johnstown ran into financial difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Johnstown sold PCM to 
Affiliates Group Inc. for about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen said PCM was not able to grow geographically or diversify under 
Affiliates Group, although PCM continued to add more local management contracts 
to its portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Affiliates Group) didn't really use us very effectively," Olsen said. 
"We provided them with some cash flow. We didn't hear from them much." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Elkins said IHS, a private firm with $100 million in annual 
revenue that plans to go public within the next 12 months, intends to give PCM 
the capital it needs to grow and diversify. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen said he is considering several new business ventures for PCM, including 
the management of senior citizen apartments and hotel-like complexes for 
seniors that provide meals and maid service. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said IHS is looking for opportunities to buy or build assisted-living 
facilities for the affluent elderly in California that PCM may manage. In turn, 
Elkins said IHS is planning to sell its existing home health-care services to 
residents of Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to PCM, IHS acquired 697 retirement, assisted-living units and 
long-term care beds from Affiliates Group, expanding the company by nearly 25%. 
IHS now operates 4,026 beds. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the transaction, IHS will assume the management of two 
retirement/assisted-living centers with a total of 327 units in Fresno, Calif., 
and Memphis, Tenn. Both retirement communities will continue to be owned by 
Liberty Real Estate Corp. of Boston.

Executives' Compensation: Two executives at American Pacesetter, the holding 
company for San Clemente Savings Bank, didn't make this year's list of Orange 
County's biggest income earners, but they're sure to make it next year, 
according the Newport Beach company's proxy. 
</P>
<P>
The recently printed proxy shows that John W. Klug, the company's chairman, and 
John R. Polen, the company's executive vice president and head of the savings 
and loan subsidiary, last year received total compensation packages of $646,696 
and $630,449, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
That would put both among the county's 50 highest-paid executives. 
</P>
<P>
Klug also earned $129,000 as chairman of Pacesetter Homes, a home building 
company spun off from American Pacesetter in 1988. The biggest portion of his 
compensation -- $544,696 -- was a one-time distribution from American 
Pacesetter's profit-sharing plan, which was terminated last year in favor of a 
pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
Polen was paid $180,000 in salary, $180,449 from the profit-sharing plan and an 
award of stock valued at $270,000. The company also lent Polen $126,105 to pay 
state and federal taxes on the stock award. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, American Pacesetter earned $126,000 on $41.5 million in revenue, 
contrasted with a loss of $178,000 on $38.5 million in revenue for the previous 
year.

HIGH-TECH FIRMS GET A TASTE OF MERGER MANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bit of merger mania surfaced Tuesday in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Four high-technology companies -- Helionetics, Printrak, CAM Data and Hart 
Industries -- made announcements relating to merger completions or buyout 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The largest transaction involved Irvine-based defense contractor Helionetics 
Inc., which said it had completed its acquisition of larger Definicon 
International Corp. The deal involved an exchange for 1.8 million shares of 
Helionetics stock. 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics, with annual sales of $12.5 million, makes power-conversion systems 
for the military and Definicon, with yearly revenue of about $20 million, makes 
upgrade kits for converting personal computers to workstations. The deal allows 
Helionetics to diversify beyond the defense industry into commercial markets. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the merger, Helionetics' top executives and affiliates have agreed 
to give back 75% of their securities holdings. This will allow the merger to 
proceed and avoid diluting the equity held by public shareholders. Helionetics 
also said it is considering changing the company's name to Definicon 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Printrak Inc., an Anaheim-based maker of fingerprint-identification systems for 
police departments, completed a different kind of takeover. A management-led 
investor group has offered to buy the firm from its parent company, De La Rue 
Group of England. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Giles, president and chief executive of Printrak and leader of the 
buyout group, said the De La Rue Group provided financing for the deal, but he 
declined to comment on the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said the Printrak management team includes Chuck Smith, chief financial 
officer, and John Hardy, vice president of engineering. He said the buyout will 
allow management to focus more attention on the company's operations. De La Rue 
will continue to market and distribute Printrak products outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
In a third buyout deal, CAM Data Systems, a Fountain Valley-based maker of 
computerized inventory and point-of-sale systems for retailers, said it has 
tentatively agreed to be acquired by Sulcus Computer of Greensburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by CAM Data shareholders, Sulcus will acquire the currently issued 
and outstanding common shares of CAM Data on the basis of one share of CAM Data 
to one share of Sulcus plus one warrant, or the right to buy a share of stock, 
of Sulcus for every two shares of CAM Data exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Smith, president and chief executive of CAM Data, said the merger makes 
sense because of similar marketing strategies of the two companies. He said the 
management of both companies will remain in place and no employees will be laid 
off because the product lines are so different. Sulcus makes computer systems 
for hospitality and legal businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In the final transaction, Hart Industries Inc. of Laguna Hills said it had 
acquired Magnolia Environmental Services of Nevada, a toxic waste cleanup 
company, for an undisclosed price. Magnolia owns two machines which remove 
toxic heavy metals from industrial sludge waste and then treat it by a chemical 
process known as stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
Hart environmental vice president Patrick Elliott said one of the machines is 
currently in use at a hazardous-waste landfill in Central California, and that 
Hart has options to buy three more of the units from the manufacturer, Magnolia 
Energy and Refining of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Magnolia of Nevada will add 12 toxic waste experts to Hart's 
staff along with the equipment, Elliott said. The company hopes the new 
machines will enhance its novel underground storage tank cleanup and 
maintenance program by enabling it to clean up tank sites that are already 
polluted, in addition to retrofitting and maintaining tanks.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Dad splatters his face with Paco Rabanne and Mom dabs a wrist with Chanel, 
junior can now sport his own fragrant emblem of juvenile success -- a cologne 
of his own. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of designer baby clothes and pricey toys, a Laguna Hills company has 
embarked on a $15-million venture to nationally sell a line of upscale 
toiletries for children. 
</P>
<P>
Kids William &amp; Clarissa has developed 12 premium-priced products, among 
them a boy's and girl's cologne, lip balm and liquid soap. The firm claims that 
its products are hypoallergenic, use pesticide-free plant extracts, contain no 
animal products and are produced without testing on animals. 
</P>
<P>
Currently being sent to major chain stores and advertised in major parenting 
magazines, Kids' ivory-colored bottles and tubes are aimed not so much at 
children under the age of 12 as at their parents, who make buying decisions for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Kids President Mary J. George said that working parents today compensate for 
spending less time with their children by buying them more expensive things -- 
from toys to clothes. But the company's research showed that while parents are 
willing to pay more for superior children's toiletries, the niche had been left 
virtually untouched at the mass-marketing level. 
</P>
<P>
"What we found out from these affluent parents was that nobody has done 
anything in personal care," she said. 
</P>
<P>
George said the company set out to create an array of toiletries that would be 
priced higher than those offered by industry giants like Johnson &amp; Johnson 
but lower than upscale adult personal-care goods, such as those sold by 
Neutrogena. 
</P>
<P>
While the products are about to hit supermarket, drugstore and discount store 
shelves for the first time, the Kids label has appeared on similar types of 
toiletries on a limited basis in upscale department stores for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came from Bay Area entrepreneur William A. Meyer, a former president 
of Swenson's International Ice Cream and president of Kate and Cheryl Inc., a 
children's apparel company. He formed a company named after his two children, 
William and Clarissa. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Irvine-based VLI Corp. was sold to American Home Products 
Corp. As a result of the merger, VLI -- best-known as the maker of the Today 
contraceptive sponge -- relocated its management and manufacturing to the East. 
VLI President George and three of her top executives decided to stay in Orange 
County and form their own company. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer and the former VLI executives were linked together through a 
venture-capital investment fund, Montgomery Medical Ventures II-LP, in August, 
1989. The new team fit together well: Meyer supplied the ideas; George and her 
colleagues the management; and Montgomery Medical the start-up funds. 
</P>
<P>
In the months that followed, the group company reformulated products and 
packaging. It lined up national distributors and raised $5.7 million in an 
initial public offering. Marketing Director Elizabeth J. Borrowman said the 
only similarities between the new Kids products and the products that Meyer 
originally developed are the scent and the name. 
</P>
<P>
As for the scent, the company describes it as smelling like "fresh, clean 
kids." Actually, it's kind of a lemon-lime aroma. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowman said testing showed that parents demand better-quality products for 
their kids than they had themselves when they were children. "This is a serious 
product line, and the pitch is to the parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials gauged the reactions of selected consumers who previewed the 
products and tried them out on their own children. Some changes were made as a 
result. For instance, George said, one moisturizing oil tested was found to be 
too greasy, leaving children's skin feeling sticky. It was changed to a lighter 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
Executives said they are already impressed with the results from the 
advertising campaign. A toll-free telephone number has drawn 300 calls a day, 
they said, from curious parents who have questions about the products or want 
to know where they can be bought. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowman noted that there have been skin-care products for babies but few for 
older kids. 
</P>
<P>
"When they reach the age of 3 or 4, they tell you 'I'm not a baby anymore. I'm 
a big boy (or girl).' They want to use adult products," she said. "You bring 
them home a product of their own, and they are excited about that."

CALTECH STUDENT HAS THE STATS TO MAKE IT TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up in New Jersey, Ari Kaplan was a different kind of kid, the brainy 
kind. When his classmates were playing Little League, young Ari was home 
playing with his computer. He came to baseball late. First he was only a fan, 
but this spring, in his sophomore year at Caltech, he decided to become a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan tried out for the Caltech squad and made the team. But then, so did 
everyone else. Kaplan came off the bench four times. He was 0 for 4 -- all 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
But Ari Kaplan is one bench-warmer who is destined for the big leagues. This 
month, the 20-year-old phenom will leave the Pasadena campus and join the 
Baltimore Orioles, because he can crunch numbers the way Jose Canseco crunches 
fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to computing statistics, Ari Kaplan is The Natural. Baseball is 
beckoning because, as any fan knows, the sport thrives on numbers -- and more 
so than ever in the computer age. Stats are used by coaches making strategic 
decisions, by agents seeking bigger contracts for star players, by fans 
competing and wagering on fantasy teams playing in fantasy leagues. Publishers 
crank out books loaded with baseball numbers, and newspapers are printing more 
stats than ever -- and even promoting fantasy baseball competitions for 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
So in the world of baseball, where ERA has nothing to do with the women's 
movement, there's always room for another good stat. Perhaps Kaplan's RE, for 
Reliever Effectiveness, could someday be as familiar as as the earned-run 
average, the classic measure of pitching performance. Players and coaches who 
have perused his computations are intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Kaplan's formulas, developed on an undergraduate research 
fellowship, may all wind up in the circular file of dubious stats, such as the 
game-winning RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Kaplan seems delighted just to be around the game he loves. He got 
his job with the Orioles after presenting his paper -- "How Do You Spell 
Relief? An Analysis of Baseball Pitching, 1876 to Present" -- at a meeting of 
the Caltech board of trustees last September. Trustee Eli S. Jacobs was 
impressed -- and Jacobs happens to own the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a child trick-or-treating," Kaplan said during a recent visit to 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan also is thrilled to be thrust into the debate that rages in ballparks 
across the land. To critics, baseball's appetite for numbers has become a form 
of gluttony, a blight on the poetry and romance of the game. "Just what we 
need," sportswriter Steve Dilbeck of the the San Bernardino Sun groused upon 
being introduced to Kaplan. "Another statistic." 
</P>
<P>
But, baseball followers agree, there are good stats and there are bad stats. 
According to Bill James, author of "The Baseball Abstract" and several other 
works that take a close statistical look at the game, the analyst's job is to 
figure out the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shaking out," said James, a Ruthian figure in the field of baseball 
stats. "Our ability to generate stats has gotten way ahead of our ability to 
make any sense of it. The first generation of computers gave us lots of 
numbers, but it's going to take . . . a lot of work by people like Mr. Kaplan 
before we understand what all this means." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, at least, thinks he's on to something. He got funding for his effort 
and a $3,000 stipend last summer through Caltech's summer research fellowship 
program for undergraduates. While other students researched everything from 
asteroids to honey bees, Kaplan developed his baseball computer programs and 
loaded it with data on the Dodgers' staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltech does a lot of forefront research," said Carolyn Merkel, director of 
the fellowship program. "But we're not isolated from the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Kaplan's analysis concerned the inadequacy of one statistic, the 
earned-run average. The ERA is a ratio of earned runs -- that is, runs scored 
without the help of fielders' errors -- per nine innings pitched; the lower the 
number, the better. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan focused on a variable that is known as the "inherited runner" -- a 
runner who is left on base when a pitcher leaves a game and is replaced by 
another pitcher. If those runners score, the runs are charged to the pitcher 
who allowed them to reach base, affecting his ERA. Thus, a relief pitcher could 
pitch poorly but come out of the game with his own ERA untarnished. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan set out both to improve upon the ERA concept and to develop a way of 
measuring the effectiveness of relief pitchers to prevent inherited runners 
from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the conventional ERA, Kaplan suggests a range. Consider this 
contrast of Dodger pitchers Orel Hershiser and Mike Morgan. Both had excellent 
ERAs last season -- Hershiser's was 2.31, Morgan's was 2.54. But were they 
really that close in performance? 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan says no. If none of the runners these pitchers left on base had scored, 
Hershiser's ERA would have been 2.24 and Morgan's would have been 2.35. But if 
all had scored, Hershiser's ERA would have climbed only to 2.54, while Morgan's 
would have jumped to 3.36. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan calls these relatively simple concepts the Potential ERA (PERA) and 
Worst-Case ERA (WERA). But there is nothing simple about the stat he calls 
Reliever Effectiveness, or RE. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan set out to measure how well relievers performed when they entered games 
with runners on base. The problem was accounting for the wide variety of 
situations -- bases loaded and no outs, for example, or runners on first and 
third and one out. 
</P>
<P>
To calculate the performance of individual relievers, Kaplan divided the number 
of a pitcher's inherited runners that scored by the total expected to score, 
based on a matrix of probabilities developed by statistician Pete Palmer. If 
the resulting number was below 1, the reliever was better than average; above 
1, he was worse than average. "The higher the RE," Kaplan noted, "the worse the 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
All of which is bad news for the Dodgers' Tim Crews. Kaplan found that Crews, 
though he had a decent ERA of 3.21, allowed 17 inherited runners to score when 
only 11.08 should have. Thus, his RE was an ignominious 1.53. 
</P>
<P>
Did Jay Howell, the Dodgers' ace reliever, have the best RE last season? No. 
Surprisingly, Ricky Horton, a left-hander who failed to live up to the Dodgers' 
expectations and is now with the St. Louis Cardinals, proved to be in top form 
when he came into the game with runners on base. Horton's ERA was an ugly 5.06, 
but his RE was a strong .63. 
</P>
<P>
"Horton was the best? That is surprising. Very surprising," said Dodger 
announcer Ross Porter, a well-known purveyor of baseball numbers. A stat that 
suggested Horton was somehow better than Howell, he suggested, has credibility 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you're Ricky Horton," Porter added. "Then you say it shows how 
important I am and you use it at (a salary) arbitration hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitcher John Wetteland quickly pointed out that the stat would not take 
into account certain strategic situations in which a team with a big lead would 
be willing to allow runs to score if they are able to get an out. Porter 
suggested it also cannot account for the emotional element of game -- a 
circumstance, say, in which a pitcher like Crews is called in to "mop up" in a 
losing cause. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, though, Wetteland seemed impressed with Kaplan's work. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," he said. "It's amazing how stats can lie. But this really puts a 
lot of things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland, who is now struggling with an ERA of 7.82, was supposed to start 
that day, but he had the flu. His replacement was Crews. He pitched four 
innings, giving up two runs, one earned. The Dodgers lost, 8-3, and Crews was 
charged with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Although he follows the Dodgers, Kaplan's favorite team is the Mets. Before he 
entered Caltech, Kaplan achieved a measure of notoriety as one of the original 
Shea Stadium "Coneheads." Donning conical headdresses that made them look like 
alien invaders from an old "Saturday Night Live" skit, Kaplan, his brother Todd 
and their pals would cheer on Met pitcher David Cone. Their antics landed them 
on the highlights of Mel Allen's "This Week In Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Orioles said Kaplan will be working with their chief 
statistician. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan will be back at Caltech in the fall, hitting the books and, come 
springtime, trying to hit, period. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan expects more playing time next year. That .000 batting average, he 
suggests, is not a true measure of his abilities. "Hey," he said, "I fouled off 
a couple."

DAN TURNER; OFFERED HOPE TO THOSE WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Turner, who survived eight years with AIDS, becoming in the process a 
personification of hope to those with that fatal disease, has lost his historic 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time playwright and actor was 42 when he died Monday in San Francisco, 
ending a battle that had begun in February, 1982, when doctors -- who then were 
seeing the undiagnosed illness for the first time -- were able to tell him only 
that he had "gay cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to an inexplicable suppression system that kept in check the 
AIDS virus that normally proves fatal in a few years or even months, Turner 
lived to help found many support groups. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were the AIDS Foundation, People With AIDS and the AIDS Switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a shining symbol," said longtime friend Maura Nolan. "When Dan would 
walk into the hospital room of some person afflicted with AIDS, it was as if 
hope walked though the door." 
</P>
<P>
Turner was one of the first two patients diagnosed at San Francisco General 
Hospital, before the disease was called acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He 
was told only that he had a rare cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, which had surfaced 
as five spots on his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the public attention that was to accompany his lengthy fight for 
survival, Turner continued to consider himself "ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
But, as he told The Times late in 1987, he also became keenly aware of his 
responsibilities to others to keep on living. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry sometimes about getting hit by a car," he said, only half in jest. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled and gave his message of optimism and determination to others, and 
was featured on television in a 1987 documentary called "The Fighting Edge," in 
which experts discussed how people such as Turner could continue to lead 
productive lives. 
</P>
<P>
Turner attributed his survival not just to his physiological fortunes but to 
his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Years earlier, while working as an intern to playwright Tennessee Williams, 
Turner was diagnosed with hepatitis. He was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
But he saw Williams -- by then aging and in failing health himself -- 
continuing to awaken at 4 a.m. daily to write. And it was from the author of 
"Streetcar Named Desire" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," that Turner drew hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been perpetuating (my hepatitis) through this negative mind trip. . . . 
From then on when my mind said: 'You can't do it,' I'd say: 'But that's just 
your mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, recovered from the hepatitis, he was to utilize that mind-set for a 
second and final time. 
</P>
<P>
He quit his job as a writer to encourage other people with AIDS. Despite a 
chronic cough and minor health problems, he increased his regimen of exercise, 
working out at a gym and climbing San Francisco's hilly streets. 
</P>
<P>
Born a Catholic, he continued daily prayer and earned a master's degree in 
social work while continuing to write plays. 
</P>
<P>
He also tried many therapies, including injections of interferon, acupuncture, 
psychic healing and meditation and diet. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan played an important role for HIV-infected people across the world," said 
Holly Smith of the Shanti Project, an AIDS support group. "He showed people 
they can live, they can accomplish things after a diagnosis. He lived every 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had encouraged him to vent his feelings about his disease, be it 
conversation or creating. 
</P>
<P>
"The sure sign of someone who's going to kick the bucket early," he said in 
interviews, "is someone who turns inward, keeps the fear to themselves. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his mother, two brothers and a sister.
