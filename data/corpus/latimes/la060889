Over the years, Robert J. Hunt has duped hundreds into thinking he was an 
astronaut, professional baseball player and fighter pilot. But he doesn't think 
the people of Revere, Mass., will be anybody's fool, so Hunt's planning to run 
for mayor of the blue-collar beach city as the real thing -- himself. "People 
like me," said Hunt, who was trained as a plumber. "I know how to talk to 
people. I'll make a great politician." In his heyday, Hunt's favorite guise was 
that of an astronaut, and armed with a uniform and aviation wings that he 
ordered from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Hunt lectured 
to groups of pilots, went to the Marine Corps Ball in Washington, and drank tea 
with the lord mayor of Dublin. "I went to the White House, I was made citizens 
of countries, I was an impersonator and there's no law against that," said 
Hunt. There was a law, however, against Hunt's swindle of a couple for $4,000, 
for which he was ordered to pay restitution and sentenced to a year's probation 
early this year. That experience convinced Hunt to go straight, he says, and 
now the impersonator-turned-politician spends his days more quietly, strolling 
on Revere Beach to collect some of the 50 signatures he needs to run against 
incumbent Mayor George Colella in November.

 -- A real-life astronaut will be making a special appearance next month in 
France to mark the 20th anniversary of man's first steps on the moon. Neil A. 
Armstrong, the space pioneer who made the "giant leap for mankind," will join 
John Glenn, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. and James A. Lovell Jr. as well as 
Alexis Leonov and Valery Koubassov of the Soviet Union and French astronauts 
Patrick Baudry and Jean-Loup Chretien for a television special to be taped July 
7 in Toulouse and broadcast July 19 by Antenne 2, a state-run network. The show 
will focus on the men who landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, and on the 
progress in telecommunications, meteorology and medicine that resulted from 
space exploration.

 -- The star of "The Graduate" will actually become one, the Santa Monica 
College board has decided, voting to award actor Dustin Hoffman an honorary 
associate in arts degree. Hoffman had enrolled in Santa Monica College in 1955 
to study music but changed to theater arts and never graduated. SMC President 
Richard Moore said Hoffman sent word through his agent that he would be honored 
to accept the degree. The Oscar award-winning actor -- for his performances in 
"Rain Man" and "Kramer vs. Kramer" -- is currently appearing in "The Merchant 
of Venice" in London. ANN CONNORS

A mystifying phenomenon of our national scene is the continuing prominence of 
Jeane Kirkpatrick as a foreign policy guru despite her demonstrated 
deficiencies of experience and judgment. What entitles a person who has never 
served outside the U.S. to pontificate about the incredibly sensitive situation 
in the Middle East ("Baker's Inappropriate Role As an Evenhanded Broker," Op-Ed 
Page, May 28)? 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it: This academic Amazon has long been the darling of an influential 
sector of the far right. She first came to the attention of Ronald Reagan by 
accusing Jimmy Carter of unjustifiably abandoning the Somoza regime in 
Nicaragua. Also, as a woman and ex-Democrat, she offered some convenient window 
dressing to a blatantly macho Republican Administration. 
</P>
<P>
As ambassador to the United Nations, she satisfied Reagan's flag-waving 
objective by beating up on the often naive and irresponsible critics of the 
U.S., especially in the largely symbolic General Assembly. On substantive 
issues, her biases intruded, particularly on human rights, where she sought 
support for her pet thesis that we might need to consort with "authoritarian" 
-- read anti-communist -- dictators. She was much criticized for her opinion 
that several American nuns may have been at fault in getting themselves killed 
by a Salvadoran death squad. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most questionable part of her controversial record was her 
notorious flirtation with Argentina's last military junta. When she was 
Reagan's mentor on Latin America, what role may she have had in involving 
Argentine "security advisers" in training the Nicaraguan Contras and the 
Salvadoran police? 
</P>
<P>
If the junta were being invited to play an increasingly important role in our 
Central American anti-communist crusade, could this have led them to believe we 
would stand aside while they invaded the Falklands? She acknowledges having 
favored American neutrality, but she lost and so did the junta.

CERTIFYING PRODUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your May 21 editorial "Gimmicks Won't Do," criticizing the state's Quality and 
Safety Assurance Program, indicates a lack of knowledge of the program and the 
food safety issue. 
</P>
<P>
The certification program is intended to let consumers know about California's 
$40 million pesticide regulatory system, far and away the world's most 
progressive and comprehensive system to assure consumer food safety. The 
program is more than a stamp on a box of fruit. Under the proposal, growers are 
required to report all pesticides used on a crop in order to use the state's 
certification seal. The state will also increase its pesticide monitoring 
program by 20%. The certification program is a proper and prudent step in 
assuring the public that the food they purchase and consume is the safest in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
While we agree the program is going to be expensive, it is important to 
remember that growers themselves are voluntarily footing the bill, something 
you failed to mention. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial states that "even when a grower follows existing regulations, 
the crop may not be free of pesticides." You also said "the proposal would give 
assurances that food is safe when it may not be." The science of toxicology 
adheres to the widely accepted principle that the dose of a chemical causes 
toxicity, not the mere presence of a chemical in our food supply. Even so, 1987 
statistics from the California Department of Food and Agriculture show nearly 
80% of 14,000 produce samples tested with no pesticide residues. These samples 
are in addition to those tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. I 
think that speaks highly of the system in place in to safeguard the public. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was not "forced" to the Legislature for budget approval as a 
result of any article that appeared in your newspaper. To obtain the necessary 
start-up funding, CDFA was required to go through the established legislative 
process to obtain a budget appropriation to start the program as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
The public has become confused and concerned about food safety. A topic as 
important as food safety deserves to be addressed openly and honestly. The 
public should hear the facts about what is being done to produce and promote a 
healthy food supply. We believe your readers deserve nothing less.

Kirkpatrick's criticism of Secretary of State James Baker's evenhanded approach 
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is unwarranted, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The tone and substance of Kirkpatrick's article reflect her long-standing and 
myopic support for Israel. There was not even an iota of a hint that Israel was 
to blame for any aggressive conduct since its creation. There was, for 
instance, no mention of the unjustifiable presence of Israeli forces on 
Egyptian soil in 1956 when France and Britain invaded Egypt. Even if a 
Palestinian-Israeli rapprochement is realized eventually, it is the opinion of 
this writer that there will not be a lasting peace in the Arab-Israeli region 
of the Middle East until Israel becomes a truly Middle Eastern country, not a 
Western outpost.

I was offended and devastated by Conrad's latest destructive anti-Israeli 
cartoon demonstrating our U.S. government held hostage by a militaristic, 
Nazi-style Israel. True, Kirkpatrick's article, per usual, clear and 
insightful, describing Israel's unjustly untenable, unstable and insecure 
position in the Middle East, appeared directly below Conrad's cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick's incisive perception that democratic Israel has been surrounded 
and outnumbered by Arab enemies bent on its destruction since its inception, 
that it returned the Sinai to Egypt to insure peace and that it cost Israel 
three wars to secure this tiny land's survival are bitter truths. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it is another bitter truth, in this instance, that pictures speak 
louder than words. The issues involved are not merely torturous but life and 
death matters for Israelis and Jews around the world. They date back to the 
Holocaust, way back to the 15th Century Spanish Inquisition and all the 
atrocities in all the countries in all the years between. Considering this, 
Conrad's cartoons are sickening, totally insensitive and portray virulently 
vicious anti-Semitism.

CHINA PUT THE HORSE BEFORE THE CART; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL, NOT ECONOMIC, REFORM MUST GO FIRST TO SPREAD AROUND THE BLAME FOR 
TOUGH DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAM E. FULLER, Graham E. Fuller is the former vice chairman of the 
National Intelligence Council and currently is a senior political scientist at 
the RAND Corp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First we had Deng Xiaoping's astonishing economic reforms in China in the early 
1980s, in which Beijing seemed to be leading the Communist world in new 
directions, abandoning the failed tenets of Marxism and the centrally planned 
economy. Then we had Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the mid-1980s beginning his 
remarkable series of political reforms, most strikingly heralded by his policy 
of glasnost, which brought breathtaking change to the character and content of 
the Soviet media and public discourse. 
</P>
<P>
But many astute observers of Beijing and Moscow wondered whether Gorbachev in 
fact had it right in placing initial emphasis on politics and openness instead 
of on economic reform. After all, it was cogently argued, you can't promote 
divisive political reform without first placating the public by delivering the 
economic goods. Gorbachev has yet to deliver the economic goods to the public 
-- in fact, things are worse than ever -- as he plows ahead with the 
extraordinary spectacle of no-holds-barred debate within the new Soviet 
parliament. But we haven't seen any shootings in Red Square yet, either. 
</P>
<P>
With last weekend's brutal and ill-conceived assault on the students and 
citizens in Tian An Men Square, the Chinese leadership suddenly set itself back 
years. The viciousness of the military's action and the ideological 
vituperation within the party leadership constitute a convulsion not heard 
since the Cultural Revolution. Suddenly the question arises: Has Gorbachev in 
fact got it right by putting political reform ahead of economic reform? 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom may have been off the mark; perhaps it is better to 
allow popularly mandated bodies to endorse the hard and painful economic 
decisions lying ahead (Russian-style), rather than to allow the burgeoning of 
economic life to lead to new political demands that the party leadership 
(Chinese-style) is not eady to face. Perhaps it is best to let public opinion 
drive the reforms than to dispense it as largess from on high. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there is no sure-fire formula. Russia and China are quite different in 
character and historical experience. But both are struggling to get out of the 
same ideological straitjackets. Both political and economic reform are required 
as dying Communist parties negotiate the shoals towards greater public 
participation in the ruling process and the goal of a more truly powerful, 
effective nation state. Not the least of the virtues of democracy is that 
leaders can spread the blame around when key decisions are approved by 
political bodies mandated by the public. China has yet to learn that. 
</P>
<P>
But what lessons do we draw from these two diverse spectacles in two cities? 
Does Moscow foreshadow where Beijing must inevitably go -- toward political 
democratization? Or does Beijing foreshadow where Moscow may go -- reversion to 
brutal military repression when the ultimate challenge to the Communist Party's 
power and legitimacy becomes intolerable? Can Gorbachev point to Beijing's 
violence and bloodshed as a warning to Soviet hard-liners of what might happen 
if reform is slowed? Or will the hard-liners point to Beijing's bloodshed as 
the destiny under Gorbachev? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, our own democratic heritage should lead us to believe that Moscow 
is on the right track -- the only track, however painful -- if it is to enter 
the modern era and develop a strong, healthy state. If the bloated bureaucracy 
is to be turned on its head, better to have it perceived as reflecting a true 
national consensus than the willful act of the nation's top nonelected 
bureaucrat. If restive nationalities are going to pull the Soviet Empire apart, 
it's wiser to have the process legitimated under democratic processes 
representing the popular will, than seen as traitorous concessions by 
authoritarian leaders too weak or fearful to stop the process. Moscow already 
seems to have grasped the centrality of genuine rule of law in a way that the 
Chinese, pursuing their historic Confucian quest for virtuous leadership, have 
not so far done. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, democracy is not a panacea, and both China and Russia face overwhelming 
problems daunting to any leadership. We in the West have powerful interests at 
stake in these remarkable transitions in both countries. We have spent nearly 
half a century trying to figure out how to rid the world body politic of the 
metastasizing spread of the unhealthy cells of ideological communist regimes. 
Our preferred chemotherapy is representative institutions, democratic procedure 
and freedom of expression. We shall see whether Moscow or Beijing can in the 
end traverse the dangers and truly dismantle the monstrous edifices of 
totalitarian, ideological, communist rule that seemed so powerful for so long. 
Meanwhile, our own security is involved in the process. We need to watch this 
tale of two cities carefully indeed -- and hope that they are watching and 
learning from each other as well.

The great wave of democracy rising now in the world is due in some large 
measure to the fact that in recent years murder has become unfashionable and 
unrewarding among many totalitarian butchers. If the Chinese Communists can 
prevail because they slaughtered their adversaries, they will have reinstated 
murder as a form of politics. And the word will go forth: Murder works; it is 
an acceptable policy tool to scare off the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
If China is turned around and is forced to forswear violence, we can enter an 
era where the preeminent human command can also apply to governments: Thou 
shalt not kill. When thou can't kill, it's a lot harder for thou to oppress.

In China, 40 years of Communist propaganda have had an unintended effect. In 
the "People's Republic," everything was the "People's this . . . " and the 
"People's that . . . " Every horror (and every gain) was carried out in the 
name of the people. What the Communists hoped was what George Orwell feared: 
that the words would change their meaning, that the language itself would 
become the slave of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But the words did not change their meaning. What happened instead was the 
destruction of any basis for legitimacy other than popular sovereignty. The 
noble words gave birth to the noble crowd. The words the party-state used to 
buttress its authority have become, thanks to its own actions, its mortal 
enemy; and the party-state has nothing to substitute for those words. That is 
why, even beyond the economic consequences of their brutality, China's shadowy 
rulers will ultimately prove to have destroyed themselves.

Emotion is a poor and often a disastrous guide to policy. Yes, it's right that 
we should be on the students' side. But this is a time for scrupulously 
careful, meticulously calculated responses by the American government to an 
extraordinarily fluid situation in which our knowledge of what's happening is 
necessarily extremely limited, which we have little capacity to influence and 
in which the actions that instinct and emotion might command are likely to 
prove counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
On the American part, it's a time for sympathetic understanding and support, 
but not for heroics. Those are the province of the Chinese people, whose 
heroics of the past few weeks will reverberate through history.

Although post positions in a 1 1/2-mile race with only 10 starters would not 
figure to be a factor, and even though No. 1 has been the most popular post for 
winners of the Belmont Stakes in the last 81 runnings, trainer Shug McGaughey 
says that the rail is the only spot he doesn't want Easy Goer to get when the 
draw for Saturday's race is held today. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, whose Sunday Silence will try to beat Easy Goer 
for the third time in the Triple Crown races and become the 12th horse to sweep 
the series, doesn't seem to be concerned about post positions. That McGaughey 
would mention them is an indicator that Easy Goer's camp is more concerned 
about Belmont strategy than Whittingham is. 
</P>
<P>
"Post positions could have something to do with the race," McGaughey said 
Wednesday. "If we would draw the No. 1 spot and Sunday Silence winds up 
someplace on the outside, they could force our hand. They could keep us down 
there the entire race, and maybe make my rider (Pat Day) take up in order to 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/2 lengths, Sunday Silence beat Easy 
Goer by a nose in the Preakness, the second Triple Crown race, with the 
winner's jockey, Pat Valenzuela, trapping McGaughey's colt on the fence during 
the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1905, 20 Belmont winners have broken from the No. 1 post, although no 
horse starting on the fence has won since Secretariat in 1973. The next best 
post during this period has been the No. 3 hole, which has accounted for 12 
winners. Only six horses from outside the No. 7 post have won. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Whittingham would like the No. 1 post for Sunday Silence if McGaughey 
doesn't want it. Six of the Triple Crown champions -- Sir Barton in 1919, 
Gallant Fox in 1930, Count Fleet in 1943, Assault in 1946, Citation in 1948, 
and Secretariat in 1973 -- started on the rail. Omaha in 1935, Whirlaway in 
1941 and Affirmed in 1978 all won from the third spot. Seattle Slew in 1977 was 
No. 5, and War Admiral in 1937 was No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 expected starters in the Belmont, only one, Le Voyageur, has run the 
stake distance of 1 1/2 miles, and the French import, who will be making his 
first start on dirt and first appearance in America, will probably be the 
longest price on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Le Voyageur -- which means the traveler -- led for 1 1/8 miles and then 
finished last in a six-horse, 1 1/2-mile minor stake on April 18. Le Voyageur, 
who will be ridden Saturday by Randy Romero for the first time because trainer 
Patrick Biancone figures that an American jockey will help, has won only one of 
six starts and is winless this year in three tries. 
</P>
<P>
Biancone, who says that Le Voyageur has trained well on dirt surfaces in 
France, is a top international trainer who worked briefly as an assistant for 
Le Roy Jolley here in 1974. Jolley is starting Irish Actor in the Belmont. When 
All Along, a 4-year-old filly, won the American horse-of-the-year title for 
Biancone in 1983, she won the Turf Classic at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
No defections are expected in the Belmont should the track come up muddy. There 
has been heavy rain here for two days and the track was sloppy Wednesday. 
Clearing is expected today, with temperatures in the 70s. It is supposed to be 
in the 80s Friday and Saturday, with a 30% chance of showers both days. Four of 
the Belmonts run this decade have been on off tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Sunday Silence, Le Voyageur and the entry of Easy Goer and Awe 
Inspiring, the other starters will be Fire Maker, Hawkster, Imbibe, Irish 
Actor, Rock Point and Triple Buck. 
</P>
<P>
For those with more arcane tastes in handicapping, Easy Goer is a real longshot 
because a horse whose name started with an E hasn't won the Belmont since Eric 
in 1889. Alphabetically, Sunday Silence is the favorite because 18 Belmont 
winners had names that started with S. Only the letter C has produced more 
winners, 20. 
</P>
<P>
If there are omens, Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring are in trouble. Dinny Phipps, 
the owner of Awe Inspiring and the son of the owner of Easy Goer, was on jury 
duty in Brooklyn on Monday when his home in the exclusive suburb of Old 
Westbury, N.Y., was seriously damaged by fire. 
</P>
<P>
The fire occurred near mid-day and considerable furniture, paintings and horse 
trophies were removed in time, but there was also much damage. The fire 
apparently was started by sparks from a soldering iron that was being used to 
repair a roof. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the sixth time that the Belmont matches horses who ran 1-2 in the 
Kentucky Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, War Admiral won the Triple Crown with Pompoon fading to sixth in the 
Belmont after second-place finishes in the first two races. Arts and Letters, a 
runner-up in the Derby and Preakness, reversed the order of finish when 
Majestic Prince tried to sweep the Triple Crown in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Sham ran fifth, beaten by 45 1/2 lengths, in the Belmont after 
unsuccessfully chasing Secretariat to the wire in the Derby and Preakness. 
Affirmed and Alydar ran 1-2 in all three races in 1978, and in 1987, Alysheba, 
Alydar's son, twice beat Bet Twice before running fourth as Bet Twice won the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence paid $8.20 to win at Churchill Downs in the Derby and $6.20 at 
Pimlico in winning the Preakness. The best payoffs on Sunday Silence in 
off-track betting were $11.80 for the Derby, at Marquis Downs in Canada, and $9 
for the Preakness, at Connecticut's OTB. Sunday Silence's low payoffs both were 
at Hollywood Park -- $6 for the Derby and $4.60 for the Preakness. . . . Fans 
watching the Belmont here Saturday might have to pay attention. The sound 
system at Belmont Park might be the worst in the country at a major track and 
the new matrix board in the infield is a jumble of closely positioned numbers 
that is difficult to read. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, the best 3-year-old filly in the country, runs Sunday at Belmont in 
the Mother Goose, the second leg in New York's three-race series for 
distaffers. Open Mind has already won the Acorn and probably will be opposed by 
only four horses. One of them is Gorgeous, who has won four straight. . . . 
Banker's Lady, a 4-year-old filly who has never lost on dirt, will run Saturday 
in the Hempstead Handicap, a supporting stake on the Belmont card. Is It True, 
winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile over Easy Goer, is scheduled to 
run in another stake at Belmont on Saturday. . . . Bayakoa, the standout 
4-year-old filly on the West Coast, will run in the Milady Handicap at 
Hollywood Park on June 17. "I'm trying to spot her races about a month apart," 
said trainer Ron McAnally, who will saddle Hawkster in the Belmont.

SINGING PIRATE A WINNER AT HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singing Pirate led all the way to win the $31,000 allowance feature for fillies 
and mares on the turf Wednesday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Felidia, the favorite of the crowd of 12,960, finished three lengths back in 
second place but was disqualified for interference in the stretch and dropped 
to fourth. The stewards awarded the runner-up spot to Precious Metal, who 
finished 4 3/4 lengths behind Singing Pirate. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Ron Ellis and ridden by Robbie Davis, Singing Pirate covered 1 1/16 
miles in 1:41 2/5 for her second victory in five starts and her first at more 
than seven furlongs. The 4-year-old filly paid $8.40, $6.60 and $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
Precious Metal, with Frank Olivares, paid $11.80 and $5.80. Jennysport, with 
Gary Stevens, was moved up to third and paid $2.60.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: NAME ORIGINS CERTAIN AND UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Are you aware of any information on or publications about the Steele 
or Steel surname? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Steel/Steele is an interesting old English surname, but authorities 
disagree as to its origins. For information about the Steel(e) Family News, 
write to the publication at 813 Forest Ave., Plymouth, Mich. 48170. 
</P>
<P>
Some name experts say Steel/Steele is a locality name -- meaning one who came 
from Steel, a stile or place where one has to climb. The northern English 
pronunciation makes stile sound like "steel," and it is the name of places in 
Northumberland and Shropshire. 
</P>
<P>
Others claim it is a baptism name, meaning "the son of Steel," from the old 
Danish "Staal," or derived from an occupational name for a steelworker. Its 
origins may have come from the Old English, a metonym (nickname) meaning 
firmness and reliability. The surname is found as early as 1273 in English 
records where it was spelled Stele. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does the German name Klatte mean and could you recommend a book on this 
subject? 
</P>
<P>
A: Klatte or Klatt means "one with tangled or disheveled hair." Sources are 
"New Dictionary of American Family Names" by Elsdon C. Smith (try your local 
library for this reference) and Hans Bahlow's "Deutsches Namenlexikon" (in 
German). 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know where the name Alston originated. I think it is 
English, as my father was born in Australia around 1900. 
</P>
<P>
A: Alston is an English locality name meaning one who came from Alston (the 
village of one whose name began with Al -- the name of several places in 
England) and dates back as early as 1273 in English records. It also is what is 
known as a font name (based on the father's name) meaning "noble," and in Old 
English was from Athel -- elf/old/temple stone. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me anything about the surname Noble? What is its nationality? 
</P>
<P>
A: Noble is of English origins, primarily -- meaning an illustrious or famous 
person; one possessing dignity; of high birth or exalted rank. However, it was 
a name sometimes given ironically -- in other words, a nickname. However, there 
was a le Noble family of Normandy dating back to as early as the 12th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you tell me something about the names Duke and Dunn? I believe both 
are Irish. I know nothing about this type of research. 
</P>
<P>
A: Duke is an English name meaning descendant of Duke -- a pet (nickname) form 
of Marmaduke (sea leader; steward) -- and was spelled le Duc in early English 
records. Dunn (also spelled Dunne, and in Ireland O'Duinn or O'Doinn) is Irish, 
meaning the dark-brown-complexioned one or grandson of Donn (brown). O'Dunne 
(or O'Doyne) is one of the most numerous of surnames in the midland counties of 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
To learn about the origins and meanings of your family names check at your 
local library for dictionaries on the subject -- one of the best is New 
Dictionary of American Family Names by Elsdon C. Smith. 
</P>
<P>

publications, consult the comprehensive listing published by Summit 
Publications, P.O. Box 222, Munroe Falls, Ohio 44262, entitled "Family 
Associations, Societies and Reunions ($8 ppd.); and Directory of Family (One

INTO THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Monday night's premiere of "Scenes From the Class Struggle in 
Beverly Hills," the new comedy from Cinecom and director Paul Bartel, held at 
the new Directors Guild Theatre in West Hollywood. Perhaps best described as an 
"amorality play," the film suggests that the idle rich of Beverly Hills are 
much more interested in boudoir hopping than boutique shopping. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: At the reception after the screening, guests were wondering how a 
sophisticated comedy about the sex life styles of the rich and famous would go 
over in the cineplexes of the Bible Belt. "I like the film," said Sneak 
Preview's critic Michael Medved. "And Ed Begley Jr. was certainly better in 
this film than he was in 'Transylvania 65000.' " 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: "Struggle" director/actor Bartel; producer James C. Katz; 
screenwriter Bruce Wagner; "Struggle" stars Edith Diaz, Robert Beltran, Arnetia 
Walker, and Barret Oliver; and actors Corbin Bernsen, Richard Dean Anderson, 
Adam Horovitz, Jennifer and Meg Tilly (the latter sporting bright red hair), 
Sally Kirkland, Ione Skye, Donovan Leitch, JoBeth Williams, Mary Crosby, Esther 
Williams, and a zillion publicists. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: 1989 screening attire, it seems, ranges from suits and ties to 
T-shirts and Levi's. Women who want their pictures taken by the paparazzi wear 
low-cut gowns. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Billed as "Beverly Hills food" were caviar on toast points, tortes, 
petits fours, strawberries and champagne. (Real Beverly Hills people, of 
course, would rather die than ingest so many calories.) 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: A pianist in a dinner jacket played Gershwin. As the party wound 
down, Walker sang a song or two with him. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: The DGA's new screening room. Clear sound, comfortable seats with leg 
room and an unobstructed view of the screen made watching the film a pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: The immense impersonal DGA lobby gave the party all the ambience of a 
small informal gathering in the middle of San Francisco International Airport.

Leonard Ross of Hollywood needs to replace a glass chimney in one of his 
Colonial-style wall lamps. (He'll even buy four matching ones and also replace 
the other three.) But so far he's completely in the dark as to where such a

On a similarly shady topic, C. H. Walker of Downey wants to find someone who

YOUR COINS: FRACTIONAL GOLD MET CURRENCY CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Could you give me some information about two gold coins I have 
inherited from my 95-year-old mother? You can see how small they are from the 
photocopy I have enclosed. The date on the circular one is 1857; the date on 
the octagonal is 1859. On the reverse side there is an olive branch encircled 
with the inscription "California Gold." These so-called coins are very thin and 
have been kept in a gold locket my mother's entire lifetime. -- M.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Even using a magnifying glass, I can't make out the detail on your 
coins, but the extremely small size is consistent with California fractional 
gold, sometimes called California pioneer gold. The round and octagonal shapes 
are also reflective of California gold. 
</P>
<P>
Due to a variety of historical circumstances, the need for money in Gold Rush 
California was filled by privately made gold coins in denominations of 25 
cents, 50 cents and $1. Some of these unofficial coins from many different 
minters had a Liberty head design, others had an Indian design. Most were 
crudely made but they served the purpose of facilitating commerce in a region 
short on -- and distrustful of -- cash but rich with gold. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, this is a rather neglected area of numismatics. While 
California gold was widely circulated from 1852 to about 1882, it is estimated 
that only about 5,000 pieces still exist. And these are in various sizes, 
shapes, denominations, designs and varieties. Unfortunately, many look-alike 
copies also exist. The telltale clue here is either a bear or the word Eureka, 
which makes them worthless numismatically. Genuine pieces -- yours will have to 
be authenticated -- are in the $50-to-$75 range and up. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please estimate the value of the following proof and mint sets we want to 
evaluate for our children. The U.S. proof sets are: 1969, '70 and '71. The mint 
sets are: 1963, '64, '65, '68 and '69. Also, there's a special mint set, 1966, 
an American Revolution Bicentennial Washington piece, 1976, and an American 
Revolution sterling silver medal (Adams-Henry). -- R.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Later-date U.S. proof and mint sets do not command a great premium at this 
time. Perhaps it is still too soon for them to appreciate. Perhaps there are 
just too many on the market. In any event, the 1969 proof set is $5, the '70 is 
$10 and the '71 is $4. The 1963 mint set is $20, the '64 is $15, the '65 is 
$10, the '68 is $6 and the '69 is $8. The 1966 special mint set is $7. Your 
Washington piece has little or no collector value; the silver medal is worth 
its silver content, about $5. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I just came across a U.S. $5 bill, 1934 Series. Printed across the back is 
the word Hawaii. Also, in two places on the front the numbers are in red, as is 
the seal. Could you let me know if it has any value? -- N.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your bill is a Hawaii overprint, made for use in the Islands. It's probably 
worth about $7 or $8. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I came across a stack of bills that were printed by the Japanese government, 
presumably during wartime. They are in Mexican denominations ranging from 5 
centavos to 100 pesos. Could these possibly be worth anything? -- J.P.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: What you have is occupation currency. It was probably made for use in the 
Philippines, not in Mexico, as you suggest. There are collectors of occupation 
money, but the premium is not great. You'd have to shop around for the best 
price.

A commemorative medal honoring both the Bicentennial of Congress and the 
inauguration of the first President is being offered by the United States 
Capitol Historical Society. The 1989 medal (pictured) was sculpted by Marcel 
Jovine and features John Adams, first president of the Senate, and Frederick 
Muhlenberg, first Speaker of the House, on the obverse. The reverse depicts 
George Washington's inauguration. Medals are $9 in 1 1/2-inch bronze, $34 in 
3-inch bronze, $50 in 1 1/2-inch sterling silver proof, $300 in 3-inch sterling 
silver, and $700 in 1 5/16-inch 18-karat gold. Order from the United States

<P>
Coins commemorating the Bicentennial of Congress will be struck Wednesday 
morning at the East Front of the Capitol Building in Washington. This will be 
the first time since 1792 that official U.S. coins will be struck outside of a 
Mint facility. Proceeds from the sales of this coin series will be used to 
restore and preserve the Capitol Building. It is estimated that $22 million 
will be raised.

YOUR BOOKSHELF: PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR CHILDREN ON HOME CARE FOR AGING PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSELLE M. LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking Care of Your Aging Family Members by Nancy R. Hooyman and Wendy 
Lustbender (The Free Press: Macmillan: $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
Look around and see the slow but steady graying of America. More than 11% of 
the population has reached age 65, while the fastest-growing segment is 75 and 
older. Essentially a "brief" for members of the "sandwich generation" who want 
to provide quality home care for their parents, this book asks for better 
financial support and improved human services from the community and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Though most families try mightily to avoid institutionalizing their parents, 
this may prove difficult to avoid. Many of the women who bear the traditional 
burden as primary care givers are in the work force; the nuclear family has all 
but disappeared and, most significantly, the United States remains one of the 
few industrialized nations that doesn't offer at least a stipend for home care. 
</P>
<P>
To lighten the load, the authors make numerous practical suggestions. These 
range from ways to help parents function in their own homes to sharing the 
burden with siblings and other family members, to finding "natural helpers" 
(such as beauticians, market checkers and park attendants) to keep an eye on 
the vulnerable elderly when they are in the helpers' area. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the authors have produced a guide written in nondescript prose 
in tiny type, with dutiful end notes that conclude each chapter. Despite a very 
useful "bottom-line" chart of the economics of Medicare and Medicaid, this book 
taxed both my patience and vision, because it covers most of the material many 
of us already know. ROSELLE M. LEWIS

NBC News officials decided not to send correspondent Garrick Utley to Beijing 
after all. He will stay in New York, NBC said Wednesday. The network on Monday 
had said Utley, co-anchor of "Sunday Today" and "Meet the Press," would head 
for China the next day to join NBC's staff there. Utley, a former foreign 
correspondent, said he was en route to Kennedy Airport here Tuesday when he got 
the message. After considering the changing situation in Beijing and how long 
he might be gone from his two Sunday programs and other NBC work, Utley said 
his bosses decided that they didn't want him to go. "God knows I'd love to be 
there," said Utley, a 16-year NBC veteran whose background includes two years 
covering the Vietnam war and who was in China for five weeks in 1987 for a 
series of special reports. Claudia Puig

Garry Trudeau has withdrawn a series of "Doonesbury" cartoons about the student 
protests in China because of last weekend's massacre. Last week, the strip was 
set in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where students had been protesting since 
April. Trudeau said the weekend's events, in which hundreds were killed, made 
the cartoons obsolete and inappropriate. The strips sent out as substitutes are 
tied in with the Alaska oil spill. Trudeau told New York Newsday that the 
premise of the substitute strips "is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a 
whole week's worth of strips." He told the newspaper that the second week of 
strips on China was "predicated on a peaceful resolution." "That was a very bad 
miscalculation . . . and now obviously inappropriate," he said. Claudia Puig

Rob Lowe, who has remained silent since a suit was filed against him last month 
charging that he seduced an Atlanta teen-ager into appearing in a videotaped 
sex session with him, has filed court documents contending that the parents of 
the girl tried to extort $500,000 from him. The documents, filed Tuesday in 
Fulton County State Court by Lowe's lawyers, deny the allegations that Lowe, 
while in Atlanta for the Democratic National Convention, enticed 16-year-old 
Jan Parsons and claim that the girl's mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, used 
extortionist tactics "by implicitly threatening him with adverse publicity." 
The court papers said Wilson sought as much as $500,000 while the girl's 
father, John C. Parsons, offered in March and April to ensure that no suit 
would be filed -- in exchange for $500,000. An affidavit filed by Edgar A. 
Neely III, Lowe's lead counsel, says Parsons and his attorney met with him in 
May to discuss the possibility of Parsons' filing a criminal lawsuit in place 
of Ms. Wilson's civil suit, and asked again for the money to prevent that from 
happening. Claudia Puig

CHRIS REA: PUB-ROCKING AT ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Michael who?" quipped English pop-rocker Chris Rea, a silly grin on his face 
as he attempted a clumsy moonwalk on Tuesday at the Roxy. While the joke may 
have gone past most of the people in the crowd, in his native land it would 
have hit home: The album that song originally came from was kept from No. 1 
honors a couple of years ago in England by none other than the Moonwalker 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Over there Rea's a certified Beeg Deal; on this side of the Atlantic he's 
little more than a footnote, remembered (if at all) for a few well-received 
albums nearly a decade ago. But the brief Roxy set made a strong case that Rea 
deserves at least a page of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a six-piece band, Rea couldn't have been more the antithesis of 
Michael Jackson. Warmly low-key with a few days' worth of beard and a plain 
black T-shirt, he looked as if he just popped over from his local pub. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed there were a few echoes of the English pub-rock style in his music: 
an attractive package of substantive emotions and playing, anchored by his 
weathered voice and impressive guitar playing. STEVE HOCHMAN

EASY STEPS IN COOKING FOR JUST ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY BYAL, Better Homes and Gardens 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Make cooking for one easier with these tips for equipping the kitchen, shopping 
for groceries and storing food. 
</P>
<P>
Think Small 
</P>
<P>
 -- Purchase scaled-down equipment: a compact microwave oven, toaster oven, 
one-quart crockery cooker and small broiler pan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy a selection of small pans, microwave cookware and mixing bowls. Small 
amounts of food cook best in small containers. Pack up and put away the 
too-large cookware inherited from Mom or left over from family-size cooking 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Search Out Food for Singles 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check new products in the supermarket: single-serving items, new frozen 
foods, products that have extended storage times, loose-pack frozen fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy already-cooked meats and seafoods in small quantities at the deli 
section. Use as purchased or in salads, omelets or sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fresh produce available at supermarket salad bars gives you the option of 
purchasing a few mushrooms or cherry tomatoes, for instance, rather than a 
large package. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Meat markets offer meat sliced for stir-fries and cubed for kebabs. Some 
even have meat-and-vegetable kebabs or stuffed meat rolls assembled and ready 
to cook. 
</P>
<P>
Store Foods Right 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy only the quantity of food you can use in a reasonable time. If you know 
you won't be using all of an item soon, wrap and freeze it when it's fresh from 
the store rather than waiting until it's been in the refrigerator several days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because it takes one person longer to use up food items, always be careful 
to store food properly. To retain flavor and freshness, store these foods in 
the refrigerator rather than in cabinets: cooking oil, nuts, ground coffee, 
whole grain products, syrup, jam, peanut butter and Worcestershire sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use moisture- and vapor-proof materials when wrapping food to freeze. 
Freeze foods in single-serving amounts. Place chicken pieces, for example, on a 
baking sheet in a single layer. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a 
freezer container or plastic bag and seal. The pieces will not stick together 
and you can remove just the amount you need.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: COFFEE GROUNDS REMOVE ODOR FROM REFRIGERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I was away on vacation for two weeks and when I returned, I 
discovered that I had left a package of meat in the refrigerator. It was awful. 
I thought I'd never remove the terrible odor. 
</P>
<P>
I tried washing the inside with baking soda, but that didn't help. Then a 
friend said the same thing happened to her and she used fresh ground coffee to 
remove the odor. All I did was put some coffee grounds on a couple of paper 
plates and set them on two shelves. I couldn't believe how the odor disappeared 
after two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. W., Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I was at a friend's home last week having dinner when I 
accidentally got a few drops of salad oil on my blouse. Automatically I ran to 
the sink ready to put cold water on it when my friend stopped me. 
</P>
<P>
She handed me some baby powder and told me to put some over the spots. It was 
amazing how the powder got thick as the oil absorbed. I wiped it off and 
applied more and let it set awhile. The spots disappeared when I wiped the 
powder away. I washed the blouse the next day and there wasn't a sign of an oil 
stain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LOUISE, Houston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My family enjoys pasta, but I just can't seem to make it right. 
It's sticky and my family doesn't like it. What can I do to prevent it from 
sticking all together? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, New York City 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: All you need to do is put about a tablespoon of oil (olive oil 
works well) in the water before boiling the pasta. 
</P>
<P>
When the pasta is ready, drain and rinse it if you prefer with cool water. This 
should make your pasta sticky-free, and your family will enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have found a new way of getting my house fresher smelling when 
I vacuum. I just get a couple of cotton balls, spray them with my favorite 
cologne or perfume and put them in a new vacuum-cleaner bag. 
</P>
<P>
As I vacuum, my house smells terrific. No more musty odors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LORIE, Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READERS: Picnic and barbecue time is fast approaching; in fact, it's 
already here for a lot of us. A leisurely weekend outdoors is always great, but 
you can still enjoy cooking out even when time is short by using a few 
time-savers. One of the best is your microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
Start the meat in your microwave. Cook it about three-quarters of the way done, 
then finish it on the barbecue. The microwaving will help the meat stay moist 
as well as getting it done quicker, and finishing it on the grill will give it 
that great barbecue flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetables can also be cooked in the microwave, then reheated on the grill. 
Bake potatoes, corn on the cob and onions according to directions for your 
microwave oven, then wrap them in foil and put them into the coals for 10-15 
minutes to reheat. 
</P>
<P>
These shortcuts can be used even when the barbecue is at a picnic site rather 
than in the back yard. Start the foods in the microwave oven, then chill them 
thoroughly. Be sure to keep them well chilled until you finish cooking or 
reheating them. 
</P>
<P>
Use your barbecue to cook ahead too. Grill extra steaks, chops, hamburgers and 
chicken, then wrap and freeze quickly. Next time you're hungry for barbecue but 
don't have time to fire up the grill, just pop the frozen pieces in your 
microwave oven to defrost and heat for a fast, easy picnic without any fuss. 
</P>
<P>
Spring and summer are just too nice to waste, so take advantage of all the 
tricks you can to get out and enjoy yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I like natural peanut butter with no sugar or additives, but the 
oil separates and comes to the top. This makes it difficult to stir without 
sloshing the oil out of the jar. 
</P>
<P>
My husband showed me how to solve this problem. He stored it upside down for a 
couple of days before opening it. The oil rises to the top, which is really the 
bottom of the jar. When you turn it right-side-up, the oil is on the bottom and 
you can stir it without a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Fairfield, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Your directions for seasoning a cutting board were certainly a 
great help. I hope you can also give me directions for seasoning a new iron 
skillet before using it for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- YVONNE, Garden Grove, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR YVONNE: It may already be seasoned. Most cast-iron utensils sold now are 
preseasoned, so no further treatment is necessary. Just wash thoroughly and 
dry. Be sure to lightly grease any cast-iron piece before storing. 
</P>
<P>
If it does need to be seasoned, use solid, unsalted shortening to coat the 
inside of the skillet. Place the skillet in the oven on a baking sheet and 
leave it for a couple of hours at about 250 degrees. Keep the shortening evenly 
distributed by swishing it around every so often with paper towels. Let the 
skillet cool, then wipe off any excess shortening. It should be ready for some 
great cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: It seems that I am forever on a diet. One tip that helps me a lot 
is this. When I get home from work, I prepare supper and then eat. When I am 
finished eating, I prepare my supper for the next night. This keeps my nibbling 
to a minimum, since I'm already full. 
</P>
<P>
The added plus is when I arrive home the next evening, my supper can be popped 
into the microwave and ready in a few minutes.

QUALITY CONTROL FOR HOME WINE COOLERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Wine coolers you make at home will not only save money, but assure quality. 
</P>

STRATEGIES FOR DECREASING THE RISK OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last few months, a wide variety of foods has been implicated as a source 
of outbreaks of food-borne illness. It's important that consumers understand 
what they can do to decrease their risk of infection through improper storage 
and poor preparation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
Although as much as 40% of the nation's uncooked chickens may contain 
salmonella, this bacteria is killed by thorough cooking. Coupled with careful 
handling of the raw product, the risk of infection can be almost totally 
eliminated. Follow these recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Store raw chicken in the refrigerator for no longer than one to two days; 
whole chickens may be frozen up to one year, parts up to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When refrigerating raw chicken, make certain it does not come in contact 
with other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rinse chicken with cold water before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thoroughly wash anything that comes in contact with the raw poultry using 
hot soapy water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook chicken to an internal temperature of 180 to 185 degrees, using a meat 
thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For stuffed birds, lightly spoon the dressing into the cavity just before 
roasting. To be fully cooked, the dressing must reach an internal temperature 
of 165 degrees. Remove all dressing from the bird before carving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEATS 
</P>
<P>
Salmonella in beef and trichinosis in pork can be rendered harmless by thorough 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials say that current levels of growth hormones used on American 
cattle are safe. 
</P>
<P>
The following guidelines should be followed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most raw meats may be stored in the refrigerator from three to five days. 
Exceptions are ground or stewed meats, variety meats and fresh sausage. These 
should only be refrigerated one to two days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beef roasts and steaks may be frozen six months to a year; lamb roasts, six 
to nine months; pork and veal roasts, four to eight months. Pork chops, ground 
and stew meats may be frozen three to four months; sausage one to two months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use a meat thermometer when cooking all meats. Be aware that cooking beef 
rare, to only 140 degrees, means that some food poisoning organisms could 
survive. Fresh pork must be cooked to 160 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FISH AND SHELLFISH 
</P>
<P>
Many of the bacteria found in seafood are killed by adequate cooking. To guard 
against risks of parasites and chemical pollutants, consumers should: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Purchase seafood from stores with proper storage and handling facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep all fish and shellfish refrigerated. Do not store unfrozen seafood 
more than a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use frozen seafood within two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rinse seafood with cold water before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid eating raw or partially cooked seafood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EGGS 
</P>
<P>
We can't be certain the eggs we buy are not contaminated with Salmonella 
enteritidis bacteria, but there are precautions we can take to prevent 
food-borne illness: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Purchase eggs graded AA or A with clean, uncracked shells. It's an 
additional plus if the market has stored eggs under refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the home, refrigerate eggs in their original carton. Since the eggs have 
been washed during processing, it's not necessary to wash them again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use raw in-shell eggs within five weeks from the time of purchase. Once 
eggs are hard-cooked, they should be used within one week regardless of whether 
they are in the shell or peeled. It's recommended that any egg yolks or whites 
left over from recipe preparation be used within four days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consumers, especially those at risk such as the elderly and those with 
impaired immune systems, should avoid eating raw eggs and foods containing raw 
eggs. This includes foods such as Caesar salad, homemade blender hollandaise 
sauce and mayonnaise, and homemade ice cream containing uncooked eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook eggs thoroughly, until both yolks and whites are firm. There may be 
some risk in eating eggs lightly cooked, such as soft-cooked, soft-scrambled 
and sunny-side up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Realize that eating lightly cooked foods containing eggs, such as soft 
custards, meringues and French toast may also be risky for people with weakened 
immune systems and other high-risk groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRODUCE 
</P>
<P>
Although some pesticides, such as Alar used on apples, penetrate the food, many 
do not. Consumers can protect themselves by: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scrubbing fruits and vegetables with a clean brush to remove pesticides 
</P>
<P>
 -- When feasible, peeling fruit and vegetables. This also eliminates wax 
coatings that many people find undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Removing and discarding outer leaves of vegetables such as lettuce and 
cabbage, then washing what remains. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another item that has recently caused problems is chopped garlic in oil. 
The Food and Drug Administration warns consumers may risk potentially fatal 
botulism food poisoning from some commercial and homemade chopped garlic and 
oil mixes if they are left at room tempeature instead of being refrigerated 
from manufacturing to consumption. In particular, garlic and oil mixes 
containing little or no acidifying agent such as phosphoric or citric acid 
should be kept refrigerated at all times.

THE MIDDLE-CLASS SOUL FOOD OF THE '50S RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE SAX, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget chocolate truffles and Scotch salmon. When I am hungry and needy, I want 
my mother's icebox cake. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was not exactly my mother's. You might say it was Nabisco's. 
</P>
<P>
To make it, she bought a package of dark-chocolate wafers. She stuck them 
together with whipped cream, spread more cream over the top and sprinkled on a 
lot of chocolate-wafer crumbs. When the cake had cooled in the icebox, she cut 
it on the diagonal into zebra-striped slices of black biscuit and white cream. 
Delicious. 
</P>
<P>
I am not alone in my nostalgia for the unfashionable dishes made with processed 
foods that were popular in the 1950s. Many of my friends admit to similar 
passions: if not for icebox cake, then for California dip; if not for tuna 
noodle casserole, then for green beans and canned onion rings baked in 
Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. 
</P>
<P>
"People desperately want to eat something familiar," said Jane Stern, co-author 
with her husband Michael of "Square Meals" (Knopf). "Even though we're now 
grand and sophisticated, it's hard to feel cozy about Famous Young Chefs, ditsy 
portions and squid pasta. In an age of anxiety, the middle-class soul food we 
grew up with reminds us of safer times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vernacular Cooking' 
</P>
<P>
The style that the Sterns call "vernacular cooking" or "populist cooking" or 
"things made from other things" blossomed from the end of World War II until 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of '50s food was good, better than we are willing to admit in this decade 
of fresh goat cheese, baby vegetables and undercooked fowl (One of the 
hallmarks of a '50s casserole is that even though all the ingredients are 
precooked, it is still baked in a 350-degree oven for an hour). 
</P>
<P>
As a style, populist cooking has been fiercely in and out of favor. At first, 
everyone loved it. Such culinary sophisticates as James Beard included brand 
names in cookbooks and invented new ways for food corporations to use their 
products. In the '50s, Beard worked for Pillsbury, Nestle and Green Giant, said 
his biographer Evan Jones, and was the one responsible for adding butter sauce 
to vegetables-in-a-pouch. 
</P>
<P>
But when food fashion turned away from hamburger pies and cake-mix cakes, home 
cooks remained faithful. You have only to look at the hundreds of dishes made 
with Bisquick and Jell-O in spiral-bound charity cookbooks to see how faithful 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Are people still cooking this way?" Stern asked. "You bet they are. It really 
tickles me that Michael and I are credited with bringing back a style, when in 
99% of the country, it simply never went away." 
</P>
<P>
Now the fashionable food world is paying attention again. Fifties food is 
coming back, along with '50s harlequin glasses, pedal pushers, kidney-shaped 
coffee tables and linoleum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Time of Optimism 
</P>
<P>
The '50s were certainly a time of optimism. The war, which introduced GIs to 
croissants and pizza, also convinced them that there was no place like home. 
The women who had been filling in for them at work covered their typewriters, 
put down their riveting guns and went back to the kitchen. The birthrate went 
up. The move to the suburbs began. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, it seems, could be less like our own decade of two-career families, 
workaholics and restaurant mania. But that is just why the nostalgia makes 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
A recipe does more than tell us how to cook: It also communicates a set of 
values. The nostalgia we feel for English-muffin pizza and Ginger-Ale salad 
echoes our nostalgia for what seems a simpler time: for Lucy, Ozzie and 
Harriet, Beaver, Dobie Gillis and the Honeymooners; for a time before 
technology got out of hand, when Mom was in the kitchen and all was right with 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we are not so different from the people of the '50s as we think. We are 
still in love with technology, although now our toys are microwave ovens 
instead of home freezers. 
</P>
<P>
We still care about speed and convenience. How much difference is there between 
1988's frozen dinner and 1955's canned sausage, corn, lima bean and cheese-soup 
casserole? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catchword Is 'Grazing' 
</P>
<P>
We still like portable and snack foods. Much of '50s food was designed to be 
eaten on a patio or while watching Milton Berle on the new television set. 
Thirty years later, the catchword is grazing, and we are eating while walking 
on the street or sitting in front of the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
And if predictions are right, we are also going to be spending more time at 
home. Kraft Inc. does a study of consumer trends every year. What it found this 
year, said Velveeta spokeswoman Kim Burson, is that we are not going to 
restaurants as much as we did. We are getting married, having babies and 
enjoying homebound activities such as watching the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
We are moving to the suburbs. We are buying houses. If we have an old house, we 
are not trading up but renovating it ourselves. On our days off, we are looking 
for activities to do with the whole family, such as gardening, bike-riding and 
walking. 
</P>
<P>
Sound familiar?

ABOUT WINE: FETZER MOVES FORWARD WITH POP-PREMIUM WINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Family-owned and operated Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino County not only is one 
of the savviest wineries in the business, but it's always coming up with 
something new and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
The latest wrinkle is a major move forward with its line of wines in the 
Pop-Premium category -- wines intended to sell for $5 or less. That move is a 
strong commitment to the state of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Pop-Premium wines are cork-finished varietal wines that include Chardonnay and 
White Zinfandel (or some other "blush" wine), made to sell for between $3-$7 
for a 750-milliliter bottle. Most wineries also offer a Cabernet Sauvignon and 
a Sauvignon Blanc in that price range. 
</P>
<P>
Fetzer has all four wines in a line once called Bel Arbres and wine maker Paul 
Dolan makes them all very well. The changes in the Bel Arbres line are not in 
wine quality, but they are important to consumers looking for value wines. 
</P>
<P>
The first and most obvious change is that the name of the line has been 
changed. It is now called Bel Arbors. 
</P>
<P>
"People couldn't pronounce Arbres," said Dolan, noting that the second word is 
properly pronounced "arbz." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Talk of the Town 
</P>
<P>
"We got everything from 'ar-bray' to 'arb' and people were talking more about 
how to pronounce it than about the wine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So the name was changed, but the name of the Redwood Valley country lane on 
which the original Fetzer winery is located, Bel Arbres, will stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
The next change is with the appellation on three of the four wines. A year ago, 
Fetzer announced it was testing Washington State grapes, partly because of the 
difficulty of getting top-quality California grapes at prices that would permit 
the Pop-Premium wines to maintain their prices. 
</P>
<P>
A rule of thumb in the wine industry says that the price of a ton of grapes 
equates to the price of a bottle of wine from those grapes in a ratio of a 
dollar to a penny. That is, if a winery pays $1,200 for a ton of Cabernet 
grapes, the resulting wine should sell for $12 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
With Chardonnay grapes costing in the neighborhood of $1,500 a ton these days, 
a bottle of Chardonnay should cost approximately $15, and for Pop-Premium 
producers to keep their prices at $5 means they have to use a great number of 
tricks. 
</P>
<P>
One is to blend. A lot of wineries making Pop-Premium Chardonnay blend in the 
maximum legal limit of 25% other varieties (Riesling is popular because of its 
floral nature and its relatively low price). This, of course, makes a 
Chardonnay with an aroma not totally typical of Chardonnay, and a lot of 
Americans are now becoming convinced that this floral "Riesling-like" 
characteristic is what Chardonnay is supposed to taste like. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, Fetzer and a number of other wineries went to Washington 
for Chardonnay grapes because of a bumper crop and not enough takers. Fetzer 
bought Washington State wine in 1987 and released Bel Arbres wine that was from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A problem existed, however, with the law. The California Department of Health 
and Welfare ruled that the appellation "California and Washington" could not 
appear on the label because California's name cannot appear as a designated 
region unless every grape in the bottle came from California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Inappropriate Name 
</P>
<P>
And the federal government ruled that "Washington" was inappropriate as an 
appellation (even though it would have been entirely truthful) because 
Washington doesn't adjoin California. Thus the appellation had to be American. 
And with an American appellation came another confusing law: Fetzer was 
prohibited from using a vintage date of any sort on the label, even though that 
wine came entirely from the 1987 vintage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the first Bel Arbors American-designated, non-vintage wines were 
excellent. Now the first Bel Arbors wines are out, and they are better. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another change. The appellation now says American-Grown, turning 
the appellation line on the wine label from a mere geographic designation to a 
descriptive phrase -- the first time the federal government has ever permitted 
such a term. 
</P>
<P>
The new line is still hamstrung, however. There is no vintage date on three of 
the four wines, even though all are from single vintages. The White Zinfandel, 
with a California appellation, has the 1988 vintage listed. The two white 
wines, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, are from 1988 and the Cabernet is from 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although the winery is prohibited from telling you the vintage, it is 
attempting to work out a sophisticated way to tell consumers which vintage they 
are buying, so next year there may be another change in the packaging, however 
slight. (It also has hired a person in Washington to assist in getting the law, 
which dates to before Prohibition, changed.) 
</P>
<P>
Fetzer wasn't the first winery to investigate the use of grapes from 
Washington. Others who did so include Belvedere Winery in Sonoma County, Round 
Hill in Napa, and J. Lohr in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fetzer remains the only major winery still strongly committed to 
Washington, and Dolan notes, "We're interested greatly in the grapes of Oregon 
and Washington, the entire Pacific Northwest. They're good grapes and the 
prices are fair." 
</P>
<P>
With its new, strong commitment to wine from Washington, Fetzer will use the 
new Bel Arbors line to leap into the race with the leaders in the Pop-Premium 
segment of the market, a segment now dominated by Sebastiani and Glen Ellen, 
both of Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Substantial Increase 
</P>
<P>
The Bel Arbors line of wines, which was 270,000 cases in 1988, will be 500,000 
cases this year, Dolan said, as the Fetzer family takes full advantage of a 
huge, ultra-modern wine making facility just completed at Hopland, south of 
where the old winery is located. 
</P>
<P>
That 500,000 case total doesn't put Fetzer into direct competition with the 
likes of Sebastiani, Glen Ellen or Gallo, but then look at the other wines 
Fetzer made in 1988: Sundial Chardonnay, 340,000 cases; Lake County Cabernet 
Sauvignon, 200,000 cases, Gewurztraminer, 150,000 cases, not to mention a large 
amount of White Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>
And the amazing thing is that Fetzer's quality for these wines remains among 
the highest in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four new Bel Arbors wines, I preferred the Cabernet and the Sauvignon 
Blanc to the others. The Cabernet has lovely cedar and herbal notes with good 
cherry-like fruit and excellent balance. The attractive Sauvignon Blanc offers 
typical new mown hay and melon aromas and the wine, though totally dry, is soft 
and appealing in the finish. 
</P>
<P>
The Chardonnay, another good one, is peachy and has a creaminess that makes it 
intriguing, but I find the Fetzer Sundial wine, for about $2 more, far better 
and a better value. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1986 Fenestra Merlot ($11) -- A stunning example of superb 
grapes and brilliant wine making. The natural leafy and olivey elements of the 
Merlot grapes come through a rich, slightly toasty, almost chocolatey 
undertone. The taste, though not lush, is classically rich, but the finish is 
tart enough to indicate this wine will age beautifully. This wine was the 
sweepstakes winner at the recent Alameda County Fair.

WINE NOTES: BOLSTERING LACKLUSTER RIESLING SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of Riesling have suffered in the last few years, both in the United 
States and worldwide, and the wineries of Washington are doing something about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Wine Commission has set up the World Vinifera Conference to 
analyze grape growing and wine making of a single variety of grape. And the 
first grape selected, for the 1989 conference, is Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
It's logical that the first vinifera conference focus on Riesling since 
Washington produces exceptional Rieslings as well as other wines. The 
conference is scheduled for July 17-19 at the Seattle Sheraton. The cost of 
$395 includes all panels, tastings, three lunches and two dinners, and all 
printed materials. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, about 150 members of the wine trade have signed up for the function, 
which will focus on growing and vinifying Riesling; marketing of it, and 
pairing it with food. 
</P>
<P>
Among the world figures attending are Peter Sichel of H. Sichel Sohne; Manfred 
Volpel of Dienhard and Co.; Wolfgang Schleicher of Schloss Johannisberg, as 
well as Alsatian luminaries Etienne Hugel and Hubert Trimbach. Others include 
Dick Arrowood of Chateau St. Jean, Brian Croser of Petaluma Winery in 
Australia, and Rob Griffin of Hogue Cellars in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
At the tastings staged in conjunction with the event, about 50 wineries will 
pour one or two Rieslings as well as other wines. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are invited to attend. For details write to World Vinifera 
Conference, P.O. Box 61217, Seattle, Wash. 98121, or call 206-367-1984. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone doubted that Chardonnay was the hottest wine in national sales it was 
eliminated when the state of California released the final figures for the 1988 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 120,000 tons of Chardonnay was crushed in California last year compared 
with 102,000 tons in 1987, according to the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture's annual report. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, since 1978, Chardonnay tonnage has risen nearly six-fold 
(from just over 20,000 tons in 1978), the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, prices for grapes continued to rise, the report showed. The average 
per-ton return to wine grape growers in 1988 was $260 a ton, 17.9% higher than 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wineries crushed 2.84 million tons of grapes in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Imports from Italy and France account for more than 70% of the wine shipped 
into the United States, according to figures released by the Wine Institute, a 
San Francisco-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute showed that Italian shipments into the United States in 1988 
accounted for nearly 35 million gallons, with France supplying more than 22 
million gallons.

CANNED SALMON SATISFIES HEARTY APPETITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canned salmon is a convenient and economical way to satisfy hungry appetites. 
There are five different species of Pacific salmon which vary in color and 
texture, all of which provide a rich source of vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the species of salmon is Chinook, which is rich in oil with easy-to-flake 
flesh. This type is most commonly used in salads. 
</P>
<P>
Chum has a light color, is coarser in texture and is generally less expensive 
than other salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Other varieties include Coho, perfect in almost any recipe, and available in 
red or pink; and Red Sockeye -- with its deep red color and high amount of oil, 
it can easily be used for sandwiches, salads, hors d'oeuvres or garnishes. 
</P>
<P>
Try this Quick Salmon Rice Casserole, for a fast and good tasting main dish. 
</P>
<P>
Flake 1 (7 3/4-ounce) can salmon into buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole. Stir in 3 
cups cooked rice, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/4 cup chopped celery, 1/2 
teaspoon dill weed, 3/4 cup shredded medium Cheddar cheese, 1 (10 1/2-ounce) 
can condensed cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup milk. Bake at 350 degrees 25 
to 30 minutes. Makes 4 servings.

SIMPLE SECRET TO CREATING AN INVITING BRUNCH TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martha Stewart, author and authority on entertaining in the home, advocates 
using collectible china to create an inviting table. 
</P>
<P>
For a brunch, which she describes as "a perfect way to entertain informally," 
she suggests a table of unusual china or pottery, one-of-a-kind glassware, 
mix-and-match flatware. 
</P>
<P>
"Different styles, patterns and shapes play off each other well if color and 
size coordinate," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a member of the Great Entertainers Council formed by Champagne 
Perrier-Jouet four years ago as a source of information on entertaining styles 
and trends, also offers these suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Special Touches 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fresh flowers, whether a single perfect bloom, a spray of daisies or a 
potted plant from the garden, are a must. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amusing salt and pepper shakers, or a trio of dainty pottery pitchers 
accent a brunch table wonderfully. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yellow, blue and green look especially good on a breakfast or luncheon 
table. Use brightly hued cloth napkins or pretty dish towels; if buffet style, 
roll each guest's utensils in a napkin and tie with ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Butter molds in interesting shapes add a special touch to the table and are 
a cinch to do ahead. Maple sugar butter is delicious on French toast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make one or two special breads ahead of time and freeze them until the 
night before the party. Easier still, buy wonderful breads to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make the presentation beautiful; small details bring style to even the 
simplest fare. Carefully peel 4-minute eggs and place on wedges of toast; 
garnish French toast with a twist of sliced orange; serve creamy cafe au lait 
for a special treat. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, whose most recent book is "Quick Cook Menus," espouses entertaining at 
brunch because "you can have fun with a variety of dishes, you can do most of 
the preparation in advance and, best of all, it's less stressful than trying to 
entertain midweek."

DEMONSTRATION COOKING CLASSES POPULAR IN PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS HANES, Staff Writer, the Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The soaring price of a fine dinner in Paris is giving tourists second thoughts 
about plunging into a restaurant that boasts one or more Michelin stars. But 
there is an affordable way to sample top-level cuisine in Paris: Take a cooking 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Three top Parisian cooking schools offer demonstration classes in English with 
tastings of the results, printed recipes to take home and the chance to watch a 
professional chef in action. 
</P>
<P>
La Varenne, Le Cordon Bleu and the newest school, the Ecole de Gastronomie 
Francaise Ritz-Escoffier, all have such one-session demonstration classes for 
about $35. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon," said one student from California 
who attended the Ritz school. "It gives you as much a feeling of Paris as going 
to the Eiffel Tower." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Opened Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Usher, director of the new Ritz Hotel school, headed La Varenne school 
for several years and directed the Paris Cordon Bleu until he was asked to open 
and head the Ritz school last year. 
</P>
<P>
An American, Usher has lived in Paris since 1970, cooking in four Paris 
restaurants, teaching, consulting and helping to write a Cordon Bleu cookbook. 
He came to Paris during his junior year of college to study art history and was 
won over to French food. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew at once this was the place for me," he said. "During my first year in 
Paris I ate at 85 different restaurants, and I've continued to seek out fine 
cooking wherever I go." 
</P>
<P>
Students in longer-term classes at the Ritz school come to Paris from all over 
the world. The average student is in her early 30s (two-thirds are women) and 
has done a "fair amount of cooking," Usher says. About a third are Japanese, a 
fifth are American, and the rest are mostly European, though there are many 
Latin-Americans and a few Australians. 
</P>
<P>
"Some want to further their professional expertise. Some want the polish and 
finesse that a school like the Ritz can give them," Usher says. "The important 
thing for all the students is to be in France, which will always be the 
important place for food." 
</P>
<P>
What is different about the new school? 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it is the Ritz itself and the atmosphere of one of the finest 
hotels in the world," Usher says. "And next, there are all the special 
facilities that are part of the hotel." Usher says the school is the first 
private, non-residential institution to offer a complete program in French 
gastronomy, from bread-baking and pastry making to table service and floral 
decorations. (There are some things the Ritz will not teach, however: "We don't 
do ice sculpture," says Usher. "It has nothing to do with food.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than a Kitchen 
</P>
<P>
The classroom is more than a teaching kitchen: It is the hotel's two-star 
restaurant. "Students have access to the same cooks, bakers and wine stewards 
that serve the guests of the hotel," Usher says. The food for students is 
served on the hotel's china, using the Ritz silver service and linens. 
Ingredients used in the classes are provided by the same sources that supply 
the hotel. French, naturally, is the first language of the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who want to observe a professional chef at work or watch the 
preparation of a special dish may attend one of the three-hour demonstration 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
For more serious students, the school offers one- to 12-week courses in cooking 
theory, baking, wine, bread and cheese. There's an eight-week course in pastry, 
chocolate, ice cream and holiday cakes. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced cooking and pastry is featured in the 12-week Ritz-Escoffier diploma 
course. Students here are offered internships in the hotel kitchen upon 
completion of the course. 
</P>
<P>
Courses are flexible, and classes are geared to many interest levels, Usher 
says. All are non-residential. Cooking courses in other languages, such as 
Japanese or Spanish, can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
The school's three-week Ritz Entertaining Course includes classes in cooking 
and pastry-making, menu planning, wine selection and floral arranging. The fee 
is about $750. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Learning From Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
The students (no more than 12 per class) do all the cooking, "but Christian 
watches them like a hawk," says Usher. "They don't learn by mistakes; they 
learn by tasting things that have been correctly done." Christian is Christian 
Guillut, chef of the Ecole, who was apprenticed 20 years ago as a teen-ager at 
the restaurant Barrier in Tours when it had three Michelin stars. He has worked 
in starred establishments ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is contemporary. Our program is a living program. There are no 
museum pieces here," says Usher. When he was at another Paris cooking school, 
"they were doing set pieces that have completely disappeared from the French 
cooking repertoire -- those old-fashioned dishes with heavy sauces." 
</P>
<P>
Usher garnishes the courses with visits to the shops of French bakers, 
chocolate makers and cheese agers as well as to Rungis, the famous wholesale 
food market serving Paris.

PROSECUTION IN QUANDARY OVER INMATE WHO TRIED TO KILL HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of being comatose and near death, Keon Ja Lee is slowly improving. 
She is awake, can communicate a little with doctors and is able to follow 
simple commands. 
</P>
<P>
What she is not capable of doing is standing trial -- or paying her medical 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's brain damage was caused when she tried to hang herself in the County 
Jail, and the severity of her condition has created a strange inversion of the 
criminal justice system. County prosecutors have considered dropping charges 
that the Rancho Penasquitos woman attempted to murder her son, a decision that 
would relieve the Sheriff's Department of the cost of her custody. 
</P>
<P>
Her defense attorney and family aren't sure they want the charges dropped, 
fearing that Lee's huge health-care bills would fall to her family, said 
Jeffrey Martin, a county public defender representing Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been in limbo for months while the county has spent more than 
$150,000 in hospital costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unusual case, a case in which I am not necessarily in favor of 
dismissing the charges," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the case will continue to simmer. Prosecutors say they will ask 
Friday, the day of Lee's preliminary hearing, for a continuance, pending a 
change in Lee's condition. The continuance is expected to last at least several 
weeks, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Is Somewhat Awake' 
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised that she is as improved as she is," Martin said. "She is 
somewhat awake and tracks some things with her eyes. But it remains to be seen 
what the degree of her recovery will be." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors earlier last month had considered dropping the charges against Lee 
because of her comatose condition. 
</P>
<P>
"It is analogous to someone committing a crime and later dying. You can't 
prosecute someone dead or hooked up to a machine," said Aaron Katz, the deputy 
district attorney prosecuting the case. "Now, if that person is getting better, 
you can proceed with the charges. And these are extremely serious charges." 
</P>
<P>
Katz denied that prosecutors are weighing the medical costs in their decision 
on whether to dismiss charges. But, in the past, prosecutors have been quoted 
as saying the costs were a factor. Martin has accused the county of trying to 
shirk its financial responsibility in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that the state and county have an obligation to care for prisoners 
in their custody. This includes keeping them safe from others who are in 
custody and keeping them safe from themselves, if that's a possibility," Martin 
said, referring to his client's suicide attempt while in her jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
To be prosecuted, Lee would have to be able to communicate with her attorney 
and help provide her own defense, Katz said. If she is unable to recover 
adequately, and a judge allows the charges to be dropped, her family would be 
responsible for her health-care bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But both Katz and Martin agreed that another county or state agency would help 
Lee's family meet those costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It mainly shifts from one agency to another. The family would not be left 
alone to come up with the funds," Katz said. But, he added, "payments no longer 
would come out of the Sheriff's Department." 
</P>
<P>
Suing the county is another alternative for Lee's family, in the event that the 
charges are dropped, Martin said. Her relatives declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Said She Wanted to Kill Herself 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 37, allegedly stabbed her 11-year-old son, Chung Lim Lee, repeatedly with 
a kitchen knife on Jan. 6. She told police who arrested her that she wanted to 
kill herself. After being examined at the County Mental Health Hospital, she 
was taken to the County Jail at Las Colinas and charged with attempted murder, 
child abuse, injuring a child and assault with a deadly weapon, reports show. 
Bail was set at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 30, Lee was found hanging from her cell bunk bed, by a noose fashioned 
from a nightgown. Deputies brought her down and tried to resuscitate her. The 
woman was transported to Grossmont Hospital, where she slipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Early in March, when Lee was listed in critical condition, prosecutors tried to 
have the bail waived and the woman released on her own recognizance. Defense 
attorney Martin fought the request, arguing that the county simply was trying 
to get off the financial hook of paying for Lee's bills. A judge denied the 
request, ruling that bail should stand because Lee could not be present to 
agree not to run away before her case came to court. 
</P>
<P>
After her condition improved, Lee was moved on April 21 to a private care 
facility officials declined to identify. Since then, she has made some 
progress, but doctors remain unsure about the extent of her brain damage and 
her chances of recovery, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's stay of 81 days at Grossmont Hospital cost the county about $129,000, an 
average of about $1,592 a day, the Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, with a $2.5-million budget in 1988-89 for hospital 
care of inmates, normally pays a flat fee of $1,082 a day, plus unusual 
expenses, to hospitals it contracts with. 
</P>
<P>
That department now is paying an average $500 a day for Lee's care at the 
private facility. That is the going rate at the facility, which does not 
contract with the county, a sheriff's spokesman said.

KITE-FLYING QUARTET HAS HIGH TIME IN NEW SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After work on Mondays and Wednesdays, Tom Allen and three of his buddies head 
out to Playa del Rey to fly kites. 
</P>
<P>
But these are not lazy afternoons, and these are not cheap toy store kites. 
</P>
<P>
The four men make up what they call Team BOHICA Kite Squadron, apparently the 
only stunt kite-flying team in the Los Angeles area competing under the 
auspices of the American Kitefliers Assn. The association, which is based in 
Rockville, Md., and has about 2,000 members, promotes competitive and 
recreational kite flying. 
</P>
<P>
The four men have been practicing together only for about a year, yet placed 
first as novices in a local contest in San Bernardino in April and finished 
second as intermediates in a regional contest in San Diego last month. 
</P>
<P>
The team hopes to participate in a national contest in San Francisco in 
September in the open, or experienced, category and at the American Kitefliers 
Assn. conven tion in Hawaii in October. 
</P>
<P>
The men are modest about how quickly they have become competitive at making 
their $150 specialized kites dance in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a new sport that everyone moves up fast," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
While kite flying has been around for centuries, competitive stunt kite flying 
has only been around for about four years, according to Jim Miller, president 
of the American Kitefliers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Miller said he was surprised to hear that there was a 
team in Los Angeles. He said most of the teams are in San Diego, the San 
Francisco Bay Area, the Midwest and the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Prizes 
</P>
<P>
Miller said some cash and prizes have been awarded to contest winners, but 
stunt kite fliers are still far from becoming highly paid professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is strictly an amateur sport," he said. "So far, most competitors are 
individuals who are footing the bills themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Team expenses include about $2,000 for equipment and $10,000 to $15,000 a year 
for traveling to competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the future of the sport will depend on sponsorship of the events, 
similar to what is happening in professional beach volleyball, where beer and 
liquor companies provide prize money in exchange for the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know how much spectator interest there is," he said. "When we 
perform at a beach, we generally gather a small crowd. But a commercial sponsor 
is going to want to see a big crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Until that happens, competitors such as Team BOHICA (a semi-bawdy acronym) will 
have to pay their own expenses or try to find a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Sponsor 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we are trying to do now," Allen said at a recent Monday afternoon 
practice. "We have all our equipment now, but we'd like someone to sponsor us 
and pay our expenses to the competitions. We're hoping for individual donations 
or a major sponsor who wants its name on our team shirts." 
</P>
<P>
The four men said they have no illusions of quitting their jobs and someday 
making a living flying kites. They are in it, they say, for the fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets the adrenaline flowing," said a smiling Jorge Plasencia, one of the 
team members. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four men, Allen, Plasencia and Ralph Pieplenbos, work together at 
Citicorp TTI in Marina del Rey. The fourth member, Bill Crandell, is a 
carpenter and a boyhood friend of Pieplenbos. 
</P>
<P>
In team competition, the four men stand side by side, synchronizing the 
movement of their kites with dual lines. The lead kite has a line about 135 
feet long, with each adjoining kite line five feet shorter. The shortest line, 
about 120 feet long, is the fastest, usually the most difficult to control and 
usually experiences the most crashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't meet these guys for lunch, so I got the short line," Crandell joked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Graphite Frame 
</P>
<P>
The kites are made of rip-proof nylon on a frame of graphite. The bat-shaped 
kites have a wingspan of six to eight feet. On a windy day, a kite is large 
enough to lift a small child. 
</P>
<P>
Stunt kite-flying competition resembles ice skating or gymnastics in that 
specific routines must be performed and points are awarded based on difficulty 
and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
One complex routine is called the Black Hole. It starts out with the four kites 
aligned in the air as close as possible to each other and to the ground. The 
four kites rise skyward in a single line, then two kites breaking to the right 
and the other two to the left. The two kites on each side hook back toward the 
middle, heading toward each other. 
</P>
<P>
Just as they are about to hit, they break away from each other. Then the two 
kites on each side wrap around each other and then unwrap before making a 
ground dive. Finally, all four realign parallel to the ground and make a left 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition and potential prize money is one thing, but we're all doing 
this for fun," Allen said. "If you don't have fun, then it's not worth doing."

DILAPIDATED COUNTY JAILS COULD BE DEATH TRAPS, GRAND JURY REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County jails are fraught with "unacceptable safety and health 
hazards" caused by years of poor preventive maintenance, even to the point that 
some inmates cannot be removed from cells in emergencies, according to the 
county grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the grand jury found that many smoke detectors do not work 
and that many sinks, toilets and urinals routinely leak. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury's findings are based on a report issued Wednesday summarizing 
the results of its inspection of the six county detention facilities during the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Peeling paint and plaster, leaking roofs, clogged toilets, broken windows, 
leaking sinks and showers . . . are commonplace," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"These conditions produce unacceptable safety and health hazards, as well as 
serious morale problems among inmates and employees alike. Low morale, in turn, 
results in excessive employee turnover, creates unnecessary friction among 
inmates, and contributes to employee-inmate confrontations." 
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Foreman Armistead B. Smith Jr. took the dismal situation a step 
further with this personal observation: 
</P>
<P>
"You could look at the Central Jail downtown and say it might be impossible to 
bring it up to code. You might find you could do it cheaper by just knocking 
the building down and starting over from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Studying Issue 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Melvin Nichols of the Sheriff's Department's detention facility 
operations bureau said a consultant group already is studying whether it would 
be cheaper to tear down the 29-year-old downtown jail than renovate it. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that it would not be cost-effective to try to modernize the 
jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the downtown jail is housing more than 1,400 inmates in a building 
rated for 700, he agreed with the grand jury about the many problems 
highlighted. And he said the problem is further frustrating to the Sheriff's 
Department because the maintenance work is actually the responsibility of a 
separate arm of county government, the Department of of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
"The report fairly represents the state of the situation, which is not good," 
Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith conceded that there are no funds in either department's budget, allocated 
by the Board of Supervisors, to pay for maintenance and modernization of the 
jails. But he encouraged the board to seek more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stalled by Court Action 
</P>
<P>
"The public has to become knowledgeable about the needs," he said. "The public 
has to recognize that there are bond issues that have to be supported, or that 
some form of tax increase is needed." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego voters, however, already have shown that they are willing to tax 
themselves to improve jail conditions. But a recent court decision has 
prevented, at least temporarily, the dollars generated by voters' decision 
being used for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, voters countywide narrowly approved Proposition A, a half-cent sales 
tax increase estimated to raise $1.6 billion for new jails and courts over the 
next decade. Although that tax is now in effect, the county has been unable to 
spend the millions already collected because of a Riverside County Superior 
Court judge's March ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling in a lawsuit filed by leaders of the San Diego County Libertarian Party, 
Judge Gordon Burkhart declared that the measure's 50.6% support at the polls 
fell short of the two-thirds margin for new taxes mandated by Proposition 13, 
approved in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhart's decision, which he reaffirmed this week, is expected to be appealed 
to the state Supreme Court, a process that could take two years. In the 
meantime, the money raised by the tax will be kept in an interest-bearing 
escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the grand jury noted that the maintenance crews in the jails are 
woefully understaffed and operating with only 40% of the staff recommended by 
the U. S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
The report primarily focused on the downtown jail, which Smith described as in 
the worst need of repair. Continuing problems include long delays for repair 
parts, which was highlighted in the grand jury's description of "clamshell" 
devices used to lock doors in segregated housing for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Problems 
</P>
<P>
The report said that these devices are no longer manufactured, and Nichols said 
that, when the cell doors jam, they can only be opened through a laborious 
manual process. 
</P>
<P>
The report added: "When they malfunction, (quick) exit from cells and 
cellblocks becomes impossible; in the event of fire or riot, delayed exit could 
be catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
The report identified other major problems in the jails: 
</P>
<P>
* A contract to replace defective smoke detectors has been delayed since July 
because the repair parts were "out of stock." 
</P>
<P>
* One jail had seven plumbing problems, along with urinal leaks that that 
occurred for 14 consecutive weeks, and toilet-base leaks that lasted seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* A fire alarm system at one jail was repeatedly condemned, and the fire 
marshal has threatened to "order the building closed." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said each jail has its own peculiar problems. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fountain outside the South Bay jail in Chula Vista is dry and roped 
off because water was draining and leaking into the facility. "That also 
happens when they water the flowers outside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the El Cajon jail, he said, the plumbing is a constant worry because inmates 
routinely flush cups, food and clothing down the toilets. Inevitably, Probation 
Department offices below the jail are flooded. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets onto their desks and computers," he said. "They have to cover up their 
computers and desks every night with plastic in case the inmates flood them 
out. It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols also said that, at some of the dormitory buildings in the Las Colinas 
jail complex, air-conditioning and heating vents are just now being installed, 
after a two-year delay.

WITNESS TESTIFIES ABOUT HELPING WILKENING OBTAIN A PHONY PASSPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A one-time friend of accused madam Karen Wilkening testified Wednesday that she 
helped Wilkening get a counterfeit passport that enabled her to flee to the 
Philippines in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Webster, a key witness against Wilkening, 43, and Wilkening's former 
defense attorney, Buford Wiley Jr., testified in a San Diego Municipal Court 
preliminary hearing, accusing Wilkening and Wiley of conspiring to obstruct 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening did not show up for the second day of her preliminary hearing in 
September, 1987, on pimping and pandering charges when Wiley was representing 
her. She was arrested last month in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before Judge Joe Littlejohn, Webster said that Wilkening told her 
that National City automobile dealer Tony McCune had offered Wilkening money to 
leave town in 1987. Webster identified McCune as a former customer of 
Wilkening's alleged call-girl operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testified About Sex 
</P>
<P>
McCune testified last week in Wilkening's preliminary hearing involving the 
prostitution charges that he had sex with women provided by Wilkening. McCune 
has not been charged with any criminal offense, although his office, car and 
residence have been searched by police. 
</P>
<P>
Webster also testified that attorney Wesley Harris was pressuring Wilkening to 
leave town in 1987. Harris, 56, faces a contempt-of-court hearing June 27 after 
failing to show up last week to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said she, Wilkening and a man named Phil Rivera traveled to Los Angeles 
on Sept. 17, 1987, to acquire a passport that would allow Wilkening to flee the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The three traveled to Los Angeles at Wiley's urging, according to Webster, to 
get a passport for Wilkening in Webster's name. Webster said she posed for the 
passport picture with a wig belonging to Wilkening to make her look like the 
alleged madam. 
</P>
<P>
Having obtained the passport, Webster said, they returned to San Diego and 
prepared for Wilkening's departure to the Philippines. Webster testified that 
several days later she mailed from Tijuana a letter from Wilkening and 
Wilkening's real passport to Wiley to make it appear that she had fled the 
country and was not using her passport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mailed Documents 
</P>
<P>
Webster told Littlejohn that, the same day she went to mail documents to Wiley 
in Mexico, Wilkening was "finalizing transactions." 
</P>
<P>
When asked what kind of transactions, she said, "It was concerning the money 
Tony McCune was putting together." 
</P>
<P>
When Wilkening left for the Philippines she was carrying $7,000 in cash, 
according to Webster. 
</P>
<P>
While Wilkening was out of the country, Webster said, she sent letters to 
Wilkening through Wiley. She said she received several letters from Wilkening 
that had San Diego postmarks and Wiley's return address on them.

LAWYER SAYS LUCAS LUSTED FOR DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor described David Lucas as "a killing machine" with "a lust for 
death" as final arguments in Lucas' murder trial began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 33, is accused of killing six people, all of whom had their throats 
slashed. He could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams dramatically recounted the gruesome deaths of 
the four adults and two children who were killed between 1979 and 1984, and he 
repeatedly told jurors that it was no coincidence the victims were killed in 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Williams described how Gary Fisher took his 3-year-old daughter, Amber, to 
baby-sitter Rhonda Strang, 24, on Oct. 23, 1984, at her Lakeside house. Both 
Strang and the child were killed later that day. 
</P>
<P>
"He never saw his little daughter again because Mr. Lucas killed her that 
morning," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the defense had falsely tried to imply that Strang's husband, 
Robert, had committed the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"There (was) exactly one person committing these murders, and that is David 
Lucas. These killings . . . are statements. . . .They are considered before 
they are done. They are done . . . to gratify this lust for death," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Lucas was "a hunter" when he encountered University of San 
Diego student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984, when her car ran out of gas in 
La Mesa. "He had swooped down on Anne Swanke's dilemma like a panther ready to 
kill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams held up a dog chain recovered from Swanke's body, which was found in a 
remote area four days later. He said the chain, which had been wrapped around 
Swanke's neck, came from Lucas' dog. 
</P>
<P>
"The ecstasy arrives for Mr. Lucas when the carving begins on Anne Swanke's 
neck," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is also charged with killing Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and her 3-year-old son, 
Colin, on May 4, 1979, and real estate saleswoman Gayle Garcia, 29, on Dec. 8, 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas also faces attempted-murder and kidnaping charges for an alleged attack 
on Jodie Santiago Robertson, 34, of Seattle, who survived the June 8, 1984, 
incident in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' lawyer, Steve Feldman, began his closing argument late Wednesday, but 
will present most of it today. The jury is expected to begin deliberating 
Friday.

PANEL CANNOT HEAR PORTER RANCH PLAN, L.A. RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office on Wednesday disqualified the Planning 
Commission from hearing or voting on plans for a $2-billion residential and 
commercial development in Porter Ranch, saying a commissioner who owns property 
near the project has a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Anthony S. Alperin said Commissioner Theodore Stein Jr. 
has a conflict because he is part owner of a 10-acre, 19-home tract at Rinaldi 
Street and Canoga Avenue, about a mile from the Porter Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the conflict, the proposal will be heard by the five-member Board of 
Referred Powers. The board is made up of City Council members and headed by 
Councilman Hal Bernson, who has received $50,380 in campaign contributions from 
the project's developer and associates since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The development firm, headed by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, wants to 
build 2,195 single-family homes, 800 multifamily housing units and 7.5 million 
square feet of commercial space. Bernson has recommended reducing the 
commercial area to about 6 million square feet and adding 400 multifamily 
units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Would Affect Tract 
</P>
<P>
Alperin said street improvements and traffic mitigation measures required for 
Porter Ranch would affect the Stein tract. The improvements would include a 
traffic signal at Rinaldi and Canoga, street restriping and the completion of 
Rinaldi Street south of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Alperin said any Planning Commission decision on the Porter Ranch project and 
the area's general plan "would have a material financial effect on Mr. Stein's 
property." He said the city Department of Transportation concluded that the 
improvements would benefit the 19-home subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling marks the sixth time this year that the city attorney's office has 
disqualified the Planning Commission from considering project plans because of 
a financial or non-financial conflict of interest, Alperin said. The Porter 
Ranch proposal cannot be heard by the other four commissioners because the City 
Charter requires disqualification of an entire board if any member has a 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said he did not believe the proposed traffic improvements "would benefit 
or hurt me." He said by the time the improvements could be completed, he will 
have sold his property. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said nine homes in the subdivision have closed escrow, four are in escrow 
and the remaining six will be sold within the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Ownership Interest' 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I will have no ownership interest in that property whatsoever," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Alperin said the conflict existed. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless he would be disqualified, he would be called upon to make a decision 
today that would have an effect on his property," Alperin said. "The fact that 
he owns it now is the relevant consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Suzette Neiman also owns property in the subdivision, but she was 
not included in the ruling because only Stein had asked the city attorney's 
office to assess his potential conflict, Alperin said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, whose council district includes the proposed development site in the 
hilly Porter Ranch area north of Chatsworth, called the city attorney's ruling 
"a very poor and improper decision. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not the possibility of personal gain for the commissioner," he said. 
"It's ridiculous. It's a tragedy that casts a shadow of doubt on the entire 
commission system." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said contributions he received would not affect his view of the 
project. "I have no personal gain in this thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty companies and individuals involved with the project, including Porter 
Ranch Development Co., its consultants and lobbyists, have donated to Bernson 
over the last seven years, according to campaign documents. 
</P>
<P>
"Contributions do not affect my decisions at any time or with anyone," Bernson 
said. "I listen to everyone equally. That's my job. I have nothing to be 
ashamed of and nothing to hide. I don't have any conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Alperin said Bernson should not be disqualified from voting on the plans 
because the city has "no facts to indicate that he has a conflict. The fact 
that he received contributions from persons associated with this project does 
not form a legal basis for disqualification." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Planning Commission, which had been scheduled to consider 
the plan at a hearing today, said the ruling upset them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed with the conclusion that was reached," said Commission 
President William G. Luddy. He said the decision may set a bad precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm particularly concerned by the implications this might have for the 
operations of commissions in general," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the issue will go to City Council members without being addressed 
first by planning commissioners, who are not elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Project opponents also were disappointed by the ruling. "It's unfortunate," 
said David Miller, president of the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce. "My 
concern is whether there will be an adequate hearing of the issue since one 
step is removed." 
</P>
<P>
But spokesmen for the development said they had no quarrel with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest one way or the other on who hears it," said Paul Clarke of 
Porter Ranch Development Co. "Our position is that we are happy to present the 
plan before any of the two panels. The plan is an excellent one, and if it's 
good in one place, it will be good in another." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the plan should come before the board within the next two weeks. 
He said that although the Planning Commission already has considered the plan 
at a public hearing, the board will have to hold another public hearing.

YOUTH'S FALSE ARREST SUIT IN MURDER CASE IS UNFOUNDED, L.A. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys teen-ager who sued Los Angeles police for false arrest after he was 
questioned in the slaying of high school teacher Hal Arthur was never placed 
under arrest and consented to be interviewed by detectives, according to 
documents prepared by the city in its defense. 
</P>
<P>
Hai Waknine, a 16-year-old who was cleared of any involvement in the killing, 
was represented by an attorney who allowed him to take a polygraph test while 
in police custody, according to the documents. Asked if he would answer 
questions by investigating officers, Waknine replied "Sure," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of Waknine's questioning by police are contained in the city's first 
response to allegations in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on March 29 
against Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and several officers. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur, 60, a well-liked teacher at Grant High School in Van Nuys, was shot to 
death March 24 in front of his Sherman Oaks home as he was stepping into his 
car to go to work. His killing remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Waknine, a former Grant student who was transferred to another school a month 
earlier after a campus fight, was questioned for nearly six hours on the day of 
the slaying after several students told detectives that he may have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Though police said Waknine was not arrested or handcuffed during the 
questioning and went willingly with officers, the teen-ager filed a $10-million 
lawsuit five days later that alleges that police violated his rights by 
arresting him without proper cause or evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Documents made available by the city attorney's office on Wednesday contain 
police answers to questions submitted by Waknine's attorney, Marion R. Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, this is how investigators were led to and 
questioned Waknine: 
</P>
<P>
On the morning that Arthur was killed, police interviewed staff and students at 
Grant High and described a shiny dark car, possibly a BMW, a witness saw speed 
away from the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
One student told police: "I think Hai Waknine was involved," according to the 
documents. A student told officers that Waknine drove a black BMW and took 
karate lessons from an instructor who taught him "how to shoot guns and kill 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Another student reportedly said Waknine was known to have guns and was an 
associate of a gang whose members possibly were involved in a recent fight at 
the school that had been broken up by Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped by Police 
</P>
<P>
Later that day Waknine was seen driving a gray BMW near his home. He was 
stopped by patrol officers who called Detective Mel Arnold, the lead 
investigator in the murder case, to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Detective Arnold explained that the officers were conducting an investigation 
and wanted to interview him," the documents say. "The plaintiff responded, 
'Sure.' " 
</P>
<P>
Waknine reportedly allowed police to conduct quick searches of his car and home 
for weapons. When officers could not locate the teen-ager's mother or father, 
Waknine agreed to go with officers to Van Nuys police station for questioning. 
Arnold left a note at his home that asked his parents to call the station as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said that at the station, Waknine was told he was not under arrest and 
had the right to remain silent and consult an attorney, but he waived his 
rights and again agreed to talk to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
While he was with police, Waknine was allowed to call his home and talk to his 
brother. When his father finally called the station, police asked if they could 
give his son a polygraph test. About 20 minutes later an attorney, who was not 
identified in the documents, called police and granted permission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cleared of Involvement 
</P>
<P>
After the polygraph test, Waknine was taken home, and police said he was 
cleared of any involvement in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit documents prepared by Assistant City Atty. Victoria G. Chaney 
conclude that the officers had probable cause to stop and interview the youth 
and did not infringe on his rights. "The officers acted in a reasonable manner 
and in good faith," Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit has not been scheduled for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman could not be reached for comment. She is the wife of Stephen Yagman, who 
has filed more abuse lawsuits against police agencies than any other attorney 
in California. Earlier this year, he was suspended from practice for six months 
by the California Supreme Court, which upheld a finding by the state Bar 
Association that he had been "hostile, forceful and aggressive" with his own 
clients.

INGLEWOOD ELECTS FIRST LATINO TO COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
INCUMBENT WINS NARROW VICTORY IN RUNOFF VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in Inglewood Tuesday elected newcomer Jose Fernandez the first Latino on 
the City Council and, spurning the endorsement of Mayor Edward Vincent, sent 
two-term incumbent Daniel K. Tabor back for another four years in a narrow 
runoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the election results, coupled with Thomasina Reed's 
strong showing in the school board race and Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas' 
court-mandated runoff with Garland Hardeman in the fall, suggest more 
independence in Inglewood politics and a decline in Vincent's citywide 
political reach. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said 11.3% of the city's 48,755 registered voters turned out at 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
In District 3, Fernandez, an insurance broker and aide to state Sen. Cecil N. 
Green (D-Norwalk), won decisively over former councilman Bruce U. Smith, 63% to 
37%, in a race to fill two years left in the term of Ann Wilk, who died in 
December. Fernandez had outpolled Smith 33% to 30% in the five-way April 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Tabor, forced into the first runoff of his career after being narrowly defeated 
by John Gibbs in April, saw his 52.3% to 47.7% victory over Gibbs in the 
District 1 race as a reinforcement of his political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pledges Independence 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as an acceptance of the kind of leadership I have offered, an 
affirmation that Danny Tabor has a future," the 34-year-old incumbent said at a 
campaign headquarters packed with jubilant supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Tabor said he would be even more independent from Vincent during his third term 
and would press to involve more citizens in the governmental process. An active 
member of the National Caucus of Black Elected Officials, Tabor said his 
victory is part of a larger generational change in black politics. 
</P>
<P>
Cresia Green-Davis, a community activist who supported Tabor, said Tuesday's 
victors were candidates who concentrated on the support of everyday people, not 
political machines. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sending a clear message," Green-Davis said. "This city is going to be a 
city governed by and for the people, not by and for the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, 32, who began his campaign because of what he called widespread 
dissatisfaction with Tabor's leadership, said Tuesday, "Apparently, his 
popularity as a home-grown kid had its effect. . . . Apparently there weren't 
enough people who were dissatisfied enough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tabor Edges Gibbs 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs held a narrow lead as election results filtered in to City Hall Tuesday, 
but final tallies gave Tabor 1,526 votes to Gibbs' 1,393. Gibbs had edged Tabor 
39.8% to 37.1% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, the former aide and son-in-law to the late Assemblyman Curtis Tucker, 
said during the campaign that his association with the Inglewood political 
legend was a benefit that supplemented his other qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers saw Gibbs' campaign as an outgrowth of Tucker's vow to 
end Tabor's political career after the young councilman challenged Tucker in 
the 1987 Democratic primary. After the results came in Tuesday, Gibbs 
downplayed the role Tucker's name had in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Had Tucker been alive, maybe the results would have been different," he said. 
"A dead man can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign for the District 3 seat, Fernandez, 29, tore at what he 
called a lack of leadership by Smith, 70, during his eight years on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Responsive Councilman' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people want a responsive councilman, someone who is there for 
them," Fernandez said as the preliminary results leaned his way. "The voters 
will notice a difference. I'll be there when they need me." 
</P>
<P>
While Fernandez touted his victory as a sign of a successful multi-ethnic 
coalition, Smith scoffed at such claims. 
</P>
<P>
"He was elected by a select group of people who told a bunch of lies," said 
Smith, who was running to win back a seat he held from 1979 until 1987, when he 
lost it to Wilk. "It's obvious that the people of Inglewood want a new, loose 
form of government. They've elected it. Good for them." 
</P>
<P>
While Fernandez, who will take office June 20, becomes the first Latino 
councilman in a city with a 30% Latino population, he downplayed the 
significance of that and stressed his commitment to all the people of 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a public servant now and I come into the job with that mind-set, to serve 
all the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, a strong Fernandez backer, called the new 
councilman "a needed voice for the Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Open Seat 
</P>
<P>
While Fernandez fills a council vacancy, another seat will open up in mid-June 
when Thomas is expected to step down, pending a runoff election with Hardeman, 
a Los Angeles police officer who has been locked in a two-year court battle for 
Thomas' seat. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman filed suit in 1987 charging that Thomas, Vincent and others used 
illegal tactics to sway voters. Last month, the state Supreme Court upheld a 
1987 Superior Court decision that invalidated Thomas' victory and called for a 
new election. The ruling requires Thomas to vacate the position before the 
election. City officials plan the runoff between Thomas, a Vincent ally, and 
Hardeman, a critic of the mayor's, sometime in late September or October.

VALENCIA HOUSING SHIFT APPROVED; 
</P>
<P>
MODERATE-INCOME UNITS TO BE BUILT IN LESS COSTLY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planning commissioners agreed Wednesday to let the Santa 
Clarita Valley's largest developer abandon its promise to set aside 447 houses 
for moderate-income families in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
In return for release from the agreement, Valencia Co. will provide 547 housing 
units elsewhere in the valley, 100 more than the original agreement. But they 
will be mostly condominiums -- 472 units with one or two bedrooms -- contrasted 
with the original promise to provide 447 individual houses with two or three 
bedrooms each in the new Northbridge tract. 
</P>
<P>
The condominiums are under construction in Santa Clarita and range in price 
from $104,000 to $148,000, placing them in the moderate-price category. In 
addition, 75 houses will be built on 135 acres in Castaic in about two years. 
Comparable houses sell for $100,000 to $150,000 today, said Gary Cusumano, 
company president. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Planning Commission approved the company's proposal by a 3-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Cusumano said rising construction costs forced Valencia Co. to back off from 
its pledge to reserve one-fourth of the 1,788-unit Northbridge tract for buyers 
with moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to escape our responsibility," Cusumano told the 
commissioners. When Valencia Co. enters a contract, he said, "we like to think 
we can honor every portion of it." But if held to its pledge, the company would 
lose about $23 million in revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Up $70,000 
</P>
<P>
When the Board of Supervisors approved a plan amendment for Northbridge in 
July, 1987, Valencia Co. officials said the average house would sell for 
$120,000. But today, those houses command a price of $190,000, said Gloria 
Glenn, company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The company's costs have also risen since estimates were made in 1986, with 
insurance premiums much higher, land development outlays up by 50% and 
construction expenses up 43%, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Co. would have to sell the homes for $139,000 to make them affordable 
for buyers on moderate incomes, which under present federal guidelines range 
from $35,000 to $50,000 a year, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the Northbridge homes at reduced prices would give each moderate-income 
buyer a "tremendous windfall" of $50,000, while neighbors paid the full price, 
Cusumano said. Such disparities in price would create jealously and dissension 
among neighbors, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Cusumano denied that the agreement approved Wednesday would produce the same 
windfall for his company, amounting to millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Betty Fisher voted against his request. "Quite frankly, I'm 
antagonistic to the whole thing," she said. Trading condominiums for 
single-family homes is "like promising people caviar and giving them eggs -- 
they're still eggs, but there's a difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner J. Paul Robinson praised the agreement because it would 
provide more units for moderate-income families. Commissioner Sadie Clark also 
supported Valencia Co., but said she feared that the public would misinterpret 
the commission's action. The aim was to provide more moderate-income housing, 
not to save the developer money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark also feared that speculators would purchase the Castaic houses and then 
sell them later at highly inflated prices. At her urging, commissioners said 
the 75 houses and 25 of the condominiums must be reserved for moderate-income 
families for at least 10 years through deed restrictions on resale prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, reversing a position by the city Planning 
Commission, endorsed the Valencia Co.'s proposal May 25. Council members 
praised Valencia Co. as a good corporate citizen and noted that the company -- 
unlike others -- agreed not to ask for a refund of $6 million in local school 
taxes after the fees were ruled unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court.

MEETING IN TORRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS TO AIR VIEWS ON SCHOOL SITE'S ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance city officials will meet with residents tonight to get their views on 
the future use of the former Columbia School site, which is at the center of a 
dispute between the school district and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The district wants to build up to 120 apartments on the five-acre, triangular 
lot on 186th Street, but council members question the density of the project 
and some fear it could include subsidized housing -- a politically hot issue in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, city officials will meet with residents at Magruder Middle School to 
discuss the zoning of the land. The site, which has been vacant since 1987, is 
owned by the school district and is zoned for public use. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mackey, the district's special services administrator, said the district 
wants to build apartments on the land because Torrance schools would raise the 
most money by developing the lot to its fullest. He said the district is in the 
process of requesting that the land be zoned for high-density residential use. 
The school district needs the approval of the Planning Commission and the City 
Council for a zone change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Venture 
</P>
<P>
The plan to develop the land would be a joint venture between the district and 
the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, he said. The 
commission develops publicly owned land and provides real estate advice to 
public agencies at a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that any profits from the sale of school lands go toward 
building improvements and purchase of other property. By developing the 
Columbia site instead of selling it, the district can use the profits any way 
it wants, Mackey said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tim Mock said that, although the district has not offered any 
specific plans, some council members are concerned that the district is 
considering a project too dense for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Mock said the council has not decided what it would like to see on the lot. The 
city staff has suggested the land would be best suited for senior citizen 
housing. But because there are few shops nearby, Mock said senior housing would 
not be suitable. He said he is also concerned that such a housing project would 
also be too dense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidized Housing Fears 
</P>
<P>
Some council members, including Dan Walker and Bill Applegate, have said they 
are concerned that, if the district and the county work together to develop the 
land, the district may be required to provide subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have said they know of no requirement that would force the 
district to provide subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said last week that he opposes subsidized housing in Torrance because it 
would bring down property values in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey said the district has "no intention of involving the city or the school 
district in subsidized housing." 
</P>
<P>
Subsidized housing is a sensitive issue with the City Council. In 1980, four 
council members faced recall petitions because they voted for a federally 
subsidized housing project in order to continue receiving federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with overwhelming opposition from residents, the council ultimately 
dropped out of the federal housing program and the recall effort was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Feeling 
</P>
<P>
Mock said tonight's 7 o'clock meeting at Magruder Middle School will help the 
city to "get a feeling of what the community wants." 
</P>
<P>
William Largent, president of the North Torrance Property &amp; Homeowners 
Assn., said last week that residents in the neighborhood near the school fear 
that apartments will produce too much traffic and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city and the people want low-density or single-family houses," 
Largent said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Re-Evaluate Plans 
</P>
<P>
Mackey said that, if the city rejects the district's zone change, district 
officials will re-evaluate their plans for the lot. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the school officials asked the community development commission to 
evaluate the vacant property and recommend how to get the highest financial 
return. The commission said the most profitable use would be a high-density 
apartment project. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been estimated how much the development may cost, but Harvey 
Oelkers, the district's assistant superintendent for business services, has 
said the district plans to borrow all of the money needed. He estimated that 
the profit to the district over a 10-year period could be as high as $13.5 
million. The land alone is worth about $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is completed, the district plans to hire a private agency to 
manage the property. 
</P>
<P>
Developing vacant school sites instead of selling the land has become popular 
with school districts throughout the state, according to officials at the 
School Facilities Planning Division of the State Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, the elementary school district is working with developers to 
build two senior citizens homes, one at the old McCandless Elementary School 
site and the other on the site of the former Andrews Elementary School.

REDONDO BEACH OKS PLANS FOR BLUE MOON SALOON TO REBUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Moon shall rise again!" a jubilant co-owner of the Blue Moon Saloon said 
Wednesday after the Redondo Beach City Council approved plans to rebuild the 
waterfront restaurant destroyed in a violent storm in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Don Poryes, who started the popular restaurant in 1976 in the Redondo Beach 
Marina, said he hopes to begin construction in late August or September and 
open the restaurant's doors by spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We've struggled and worked and now at last we can see it happening," said 
Poryes, recalling months of delays in getting council approval to proceed. The 
project still requires review by the California Coastal Commission, but Poryes 
said he and his partners, Jim Quane and Pat Laureno, expect no problems in 
getting approval from that agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hit By Storm 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Moon was one of dozens of businesses that were hard hit by storm and 
fire disasters in King Harbor last year. A joint effort by the city and private 
interests has restored much of the area, and longer-term plans for further 
improvements are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the Portofino Inn and Reuben's Restaurant, which were 
heavily damaged by ocean waves, is expected to be completed later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic Blue Moon supporters, including former employees and patrons, 
packed the council chambers Tuesday night for the last of three public hearings 
that resulted in the council's decision to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Moon served the best clam chowder this side of Boston . . . and we 
want it back," said Sam Clark, president of the South Bay Boaters Assn. and one 
of about a dozen speakers backing the plan. No one spoke against it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Snags 
</P>
<P>
After winning Harbor Commission approval in early January, the Blue Moon 
project hit the first of several snags. Charles G. Johnson, the marina's master 
leaseholder, filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, alleging that the city had 
failed to adequately protect the marina against sea storms. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, now in arbitration, raised city concerns about potential future 
liability. Officials then made approval of the Blue Moon's building permit 
contingent on an agreement that generally would hold the city blameless for 
damage caused by natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues, including parking requirements, public access in the beach area 
and landscaping were resolved to the council's satisfaction Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Poryes, the Blue Moon co-owner, said the new, larger restaurant will be built 
on pilings five feet above the ground and 15 feet above the water level in the 
harbor. He said it will retain the old restaurant's appearance and provide a 
more efficient use of space.

COUNCIL HEARS COMPLAINTS ABOUT PARAGON CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS AGUILAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minutes before an El Segundo City Council meeting this week, City Clerk Ronald 
L. Hart looked out at the crowd and asked: "So what brings people out?" The 
resounding chorus: Paragon Cable, the company that is the sole provider of 
cable television in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Six residents, an apartment owner and three City Council members lashed out 
during a public hearing Tuesday night at Paragon Cable Communications for a 
recent rate increase, poor service and the growing complexity of its equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Shirley Jensen said: "It's getting where I'm beginning to feel too 
stupid to turn on my own TV." 
</P>
<P>
Several of those who spoke said their problems with Paragon began in August, 
1988, when the company began overhauling the cable system to double the number 
of channels to 60. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Paragon had just taken control of the city's cable franchise 
agreement from Group W, whose parent company, Westinghouse Electric Co., was 
bought out by a consortium that included Paragon's parent company, American 
Television and Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents complained of hidden costs and of the complexity of the new 
system installed by Paragon. Many El Segundo residents must now rent a remote 
control device from Paragon, for $4 a month for the first year, to operate a 
small box, which costs $25 to install, that controls the cable hookup. Many 
must also buy an adapter switch, for roughly $10, so they can tape programs on 
their videocassette recorders while watching another channel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looks Like a Bomb' 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I just had one remote control that worked on everything," Jensen said. 
"Now my TV has so many controls and wires it looks like a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Many also complained to the City Council about a $4 rate increase, the second 
increase in a year, which brings the basic rate for cable service to $16.95 per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon General Manager Mark Mangiola told the City Council that the company is 
doing a "good job." 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent $1 million in upgrading the picture quality of all channels, plus 
we've increased the number of channels. I think we've been good corporate 
citizens," he said. Two residents and City Councilman Alan West said they were 
pleased with the improved reception. 
</P>
<P>
But Wendy White, the city's supervisor of community cable channels, said the 
city has received complaints from 300 residents about Paragon since last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the complaints go something like: 'How could the city let this company 
run our cable system,' and I don't have the answer," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Scot Dannen suggested the city look into a consumer protection 
ordinance that would demand better service from the cable company. "Right now, 
Paragon is doing a sloppy job," he said. "Service is poor, installation 
ludicrous. And, if I get a chance, we will seriously discuss if (Paragon) stays 
in El Segundo." 
</P>
<P>
No action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The public hearing was called partly in response to complaints about cable 
service and as part of El Segundo's negotiations with Paragon over renewing the 
franchise agreement, which expires in February, 1991.

SAN DIEGO COMPANY WINS CONTRACT FOR HAWAIIAN ISLANDS FERRY SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A San Diego company hopes profits from its commercial island boat service will 
offset expected losses in its Oahu ferry service. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no money to be made in public transportation at $2.50 a fare," Ted 
Gurnee, president and chief executive officer of San Diego Shipbuilding &amp; 
Repair Inc., said Wednesday. "So we are counting on and hoping that we'll make 
money on the commercial side as opposed to the public side." 
</P>
<P>
Gurnee attended a news conference called by Hawaii Transportation Director 
Edward Hirata to announce that the state had awarded Gurnee's company a 20-year 
contract to run the ferry system. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gurnee and his company will construct, operate and maintain the ferries at 
no cost to the state," Hirata said. "In fact, they will be paying us $7,200 
over the next eight years." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're targeting (ferry) service to start in late 1990," Hirata 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial inter-island service linking Oahu with Maui and Kauai will use 
350-passenger boats, Gurnee said, adding that fares will be less than airline 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Oahu-Maui run will take about 90 minutes, the Oahu-Kauai run about two 
hours, Gurnee said. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, there will be a maximum of two runs each to Maui and Kauai on 
weekdays and four on weekends, scheduled between Oahu's morning and evening 
rush hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Shipbuilding &amp; Repair will make the 115-foot boats, which ride on 
a cushion of air and reach a speed of 50 knots. The boats are powered by water 
jet propulsion, which Gurnee said is safer for marine life than standard 
propellers. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also operate rush-hour ferry service between points on Oahu, 
with fares of $2.50 for Hawaii residents and $5 for others. "We wanted to make 
sure that we didn't have tourists during that commuter period," Hirata said in 
explaining the fare difference. 
</P>
<P>
Gurnee's company predicts that there will be 10 to 14 days a year when bad 
weather will make it impractical to operate. Although he said the boats can 
operate in virtually all types of bad weather encountered in Hawaii, the 
problem will be with the riders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they'll want to be on the vessel in 5- to 10-foot seas," he 
said.

MAN CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF TEENS IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Rancho Palos Verdes man who allegedly fired his gun into a carload of 
teen-agers on a scavenger hunt, injuring a 16-year-old boy, has been charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an inhabited vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Faulkner, 43, faces up to 13 years in prison, if he is convicted of the 
two felony charges filed Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after 10 p.m. May 28 when three Rolling Hills 
High School students drove to the home of varsity baseball coach Garry Poe to 
take Poe's license plate, a sheriff's investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Poe said he aborted the prank when his daughter told him that someone was 
outside their house on Rockinghorse Road in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Youth Wounded 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were not released, sped off but drove into a dead end 
and had to turn around and drive back past Poe's home, according to the 
Sheriff's Department. Poe's neighbor, Faulkner, whose home had been burglarized 
recently, fired a shot at the car as it drove off, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The shot struck one of the youths in the arm, leaving a minor flesh wound. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, sheriff's deputies said the three 16-year-old 
students might be charged with trespassing, but the district attorney's office 
has declined to prosecute. The youths were not trespassing because Poe's car 
was parked in the street and their tampering with the license plate was so 
minor that it does not warrant filing criminal charges, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Martin Oghigian. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, a contractor, could not be reached for comment.

TORRANCE OKS $84.4-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With little discussion, the Torrance City Council approved an $84.4-million 
budget for 1989-90 that includes new or increased taxes for sewer services, 
long-distance telephone calls and garbage collection and eliminates an 
exemption to the city's hotel tax. 
</P>
<P>
The two-inch-thick budget report, adopted Tuesday, recommends the new taxes to 
help offset slow growth in revenues from sales and utility taxes and a 
reduction in the city's interest-earning revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The new taxes will add almost $1 million to city revenues during the 1989-90 
budget year, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Applegate provided the only vote against the new long-distance 
telephone tax, calling it a "side-door approach to increasing taxes" without 
the vote of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members received a letter from the American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. also protesting the new telephone tax. 
</P>
<P>
There was little other discussion about the budget. 
</P>
<P>
City officials noted that the budget has been increased only slightly -- 0.73%, 
or $612,859, over 1988-89 -- and adds only 2 1/2 staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager LeRoy Jackson, who headed the team that prepared the report, 
called the budget difficult to balance but said the overall financial standing 
of the city is sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exemption Eliminated 
</P>
<P>
As part of the budget recommendations, the council voted to eliminate an 
exemption to the transient occupancy tax that allows businesses to rent a block 
of hotel rooms for more than 31 days tax-free. Eliminating the exemption would 
increase revenue by $150,000 in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to: 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly double the cost of sewer services, which would increase revenue by 
$268,000 in 1989-90. Average household costs, which now range from 48 to 60 
cents a month, will increase to $1.07 to $1.34 a month. 
</P>
<P>
* Levy a new 6% tax on long-distance phone calls, which would raise $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Increase trash pickup fees by 50 cents per household, which would raise 
$168,000. 
</P>
<P>
The report expresses concern about the reduced growth rates in sales taxes, 
which have dipped from a 16.5% increase in 1983-84 to a projected 7.45% growth 
for 1989-90. Sales taxes raised about $14.5 million in 1983 and about $24 
million in 1988. Jackson has said the growth rates in sales has slowed because 
the number of shopping centers and auto malls in the area has reached a 
saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utility Tax Revenue Down 
</P>
<P>
Growth in revenue from the utility users tax dropped from double digits in 
1980-81 to a projected 6.7% for 1989-90, the report said. Dollar amounts on 
utility users taxes were not available. In this case, the report says the 
slower growth rate was due to changes in land use from industrial to commercial 
and office, which usually results in reduced use of utilities. 
</P>
<P>
City reserves collected interest earnings of $2.7 million in 1980-81, compared 
to $1.3 million projected for 1989-90, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest income has declined, city officials said, largely because of major 
expenditures from the reserve fund, including more than $5.2 million to repair 
a landslide at Via Corona and Vista Largo, $9.7 million to redevelop the 
downtown industrial area, and $500,000 for legal advice and studies on safety 
at the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Also, recent state and federal legislation has increased by $400,000 the cost 
to the city to provide employees with Social Security, unemployment insurance 
and overtime pay, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The budget recommends that the city postpone requested spending of more than $1 
million, including the hiring of two groundskeepers, a police officer, a 
firefighter, three librarians and several clerks and secretaries.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FAA DROPS ANTI-NOISE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has abandoned a plan that would have 
required pilots taking off from Los Angeles International Airport to wait until 
they were a mile offshore before beginning to turn their aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In response to noise complaints from El Segundo residents, the agency announced 
in February that air traffic controllers would tell pilots not to begin their 
turns until they were a mile out over the ocean. Pilots have traditionally been 
allowed to begin turning when they reach the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of testing in April, FAA officials decided that the new plan 
would not work because it would force many pilots to violate a rule that 
prohibits departing planes from flying too close together, according to Sabra 
Kaulia, the FAA's assistant air traffic manager in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic regulations require pilots taking off from the airport's 
southernmost runway -- the one closest to El Segundo -- to turn within two 
miles after takeoff to ensure proper separation between their aircraft and 
those taking off from a northern runway. 
</P>
<P>
During the test, only 26% of more than 240 pilots were able to get their 
aircraft turned within two miles. "This particular test did not work out," 
Kaulia said.

LOMITA REVISES MEASURE TO SPUR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON PCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a three-hour public hearing, the Lomita City Council has revised a 
controversial ordinance designed to spark more intense commercial development 
on a mile-long stretch of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Council members asked the city attorney Monday to draft language clarifying 
that existing commercial lots would not be subject to proposed new minimum 
standards for commercial properties along the heavily traveled highway. 
</P>
<P>
Before the council takes action on the ordinance, another public hearing will 
be held July 17. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage larger developments, the ordinance would require that all new 
commercial lots on the highway in Lomita must be at least 10,000 square feet 
and at least 100 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
But owners of commercial lots half that size have expressed concern that their 
property would be affected by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Concern' 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious there was a lot of concern about this section," senior planner 
Richard Kawasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the council members asked that the ordinance be revised to clarify 
that existing commercial lots that are 5,000 square feet and 50 feet wide are 
conforming properties. Lots smaller than that are already designated as 
nonconforming. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance has sharply divided Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents warn that larger commercial developments will change the small-town 
character of the community, force out existing businesses and generate more 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hays of Citizens for a Better Lomita opposed any ordinance that allows 
more intense development and threatened to mount a referendum against the 
measure if it is adopted. Hays also suggested that he may wage a recall 
campaign against council members "if the City Council continues to completely 
ignore the interests of the people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studies Urged 
</P>
<P>
He said the city should not proceed with a zoning change without a full-fledged 
traffic study and possibly an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters argue that it will lead to quality development projects, more retail 
businesses and services and a larger and more stable tax base. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Zinsmeister, manager of the Lomita Chamber of Commerce, called the 
ordinance "a real good starting place. . . . It's going to be better for the 
business community, better for the citizens, better for the community to get 
better control of what goes on Pacific Coast Highway." 
</P>
<P>
Zinsmeister noted that many motorists on the highway between Wilmington and 
Redondo Beach pass through Lomita without stopping. He said the city is trying 
to create "a zone where people will feel more like stopping and shopping." 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium was imposed on most new development along the highway while the 
ordinance is being considered. Some residents called on the council to extend 
the moratorium beyond its October expiration date to allow time for a study on 
the potential impact of more intense commercial development on nearby 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses 'Not Compatible' 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki said the city wants to see under-used properties recycled into larger 
and more stable developments. He said that Lomita has quite a few land uses, 
such as auto repair shops, that are "not really compatible with a major street" 
like Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are also concerned about the tackiness and haphazard 
development along the highway in the adjacent Harbor City area of Los Angeles, 
Kawasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
After a public hearing attended by an overflow crowd, the Lomita Planning 
Commission last month approved the ordinance to tighten development standards 
and require larger lot sizes. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would establish a new commercial-retail zone along the highway to 
provide for "intensive retail activities and limited service establishments." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retail Businesses 
</P>
<P>
The measure suggests that appropriate businesses would include an array of 
retail businesses, bakeries, banks and financial institutions, art galleries, 
florists, markets, jewelry and furniture stores, bookshops, restaurants and 
cafes. 
</P>
<P>
It would restrict a variety of businesses, including small motels, auto repair 
shops, liquor stores, gas stations, car washes and massage parlors. Liquor 
stores and markets that sell liquor would have to be 1,500 feet apart.

One man was shot to death and another was critically wounded Wednesday at an 
apartment building in Logan Heights, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police answered a call in the first block of 17th St. at 6:21 p.m. One of the 
victims was dead at the scene, and the other was taken to UC San Diego Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday night, police did not know the name of the man who died, nor did 
the San Diego County coroner's office. Police also said they did not know the 
motive for or circumstances of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the medical center identified the wounded man as Terrance Nunn, 
who was in surgery late Wednesday night with gunshot wounds.

<P>
A former probation officer who worked at Juvenile Hall and is charged with 
molesting 13 girls there had his bail substantially increased Wednesday and was 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Denny, 48, of San Diego, had been free on his own recognizance on 
condition that he not contact any of the alleged victims -- terms set by 
another judge. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Denny appeared before San Diego Municipal Judge John Thompson for 
arraignment Wednesday, the judge set bail at $100,000, an increase 10 times 
that requested by the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryn Rosen had recommended a $10,000 bail, and Denny's 
temporary attorney, Elliot Kanter, urged the judge to leave it as set 
previously by Municipal Judge Lillian Quon. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was surprised that no bail had been set earlier. He said he 
was concerned about the seriousness of the charges and for the community's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Kanter said there was no way Denny could post $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
He said Denny needed to be free to seek an attorney to represent him, but the 
judge said he could not be concerned with that. Quon had given Denny two weeks 
to find a permanent attorney before Wednesday's arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the charges are misdemeanor offenses involving unlawful touching of 
girls, but some are felonies. The girls involved are from 15 to 17 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A bail review was set for June 12 and a preliminary hearing for June 21.

SOCKERS HOPE TO RECEIVE TITLE ON NEXT CRAZY BOUNCE

<P>
Crazy, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
There has to be a script hidden behind all of this. Maybe it was cooked up in 
the Major Indoor Soccer League office as a form of promotion. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Sockers lost a game it appeared they would win, surrendering a 
two-goal lead to the Baltimore Blast late in Game 1 of the championship series 
at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, the Sockers blew another two-goal lead. Same result? Nope. This 
time, they won. 
</P>
<P>
That took matters to San Diego. There, in Games 3 and 4, the Sockers won two 
games they were supposed to win, setting up Game 5, which they were really 
supposed to win. 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
They lost. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out there's something a bit 
strange here. History told us the Sockers wouldn't lose Game 5, forcing them to 
travel with a 3-2 lead for Game 6 at the Baltimore Arena tonight at 4:35 and, 
if necessary, Game 7 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the first time in nine meetings the Sockers have lost a home 
playoff game to the Blast. It was also the first time the Sockers lost a game 
in which they had the opportunity to wrap a championship series. 
</P>
<P>
It all seems so improbable. After all, the Sockers are supposed to be the only 
ones who dare to come back to win a playoff series when down three games to 
one. They've done it twice, defeating Minnesota in the 1986 championship series 
and Kansas City in the Western Division finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Baltimore is seeking to strike a blow for parity in a league seemingly 
forever dominated by the six-time champion Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
Blast Coach Kenny Cooper made a little prediction before Tuesday's game, saying 
his team would take the championship if it could win Game 5. Predictions mean 
little; this series is overflowing with surprises, momentum shifts and 
last-second victories. But, if nothing else, Tuesday's result gave him reason 
for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We applied ourselves," he said. "The difference was we executed. This is a 
building block for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers will try to block it out. Coach Ron Newman did his best to hide 
disappointment Tuesday while staring at a clutter of camera lights and 
notebooks. He was asked if he was disappointed not to win the championship at 
home. He responded: "I think we're going to win it in Baltimore on Prime 
Ticket, and there are more people watching on Prime Ticket than here at the 
stadium." 
</P>
<P>
But dissatisfaction was apparent. Not far away were unopened champagne bottles. 
There was no reason for a drink, and no time. At 7 the next morning, the 
Sockers boarded a plane for Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
There was anger in the locker room. Players knew they hadn't turned in a 
polished performance for their most enthusiastic, and largest, home crowd of 
the season. Still, this team wasn't dead. Some spunk and desire remain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right," midfielder Waad Hirmez said after admitting his 
disappointment. "I guess it wasn't meant for us to win it at home. We'll win it 
on the road. We've done it there before. There's no reason we can't do it 
Thursday or Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
To do so, the Sockers will need more of what helped them win three of the first 
four. Contributions from Steve Zungul, who entered Tuesday's game second to 
Branko Segota for playoff points with 16; he played fewer minutes than usual 
Tuesday and didn't add to his totals. And Brian Quinn: The Sockers have an 
excellent success rate (16-2) when Quinn scores at least one point in a 
championship series game. Tuesday, he didn't.

One way or another, a crazy season that started with financial woes, forced the 
Sockers to wade through a host of injuries and required a speech from Ron 
Fowler, the team owner, to inspire a comeback in the Dallas series, will come 
to an end in Baltimore, for better or worse. The script will be complete.

PADRES AGAIN ON STRIKE IN 3-2 LOSS TO ASTROS 
</P>

<P>
As the Padres reached the 60-game mark Wednesday night and their major 
league-leading strikeout count hit 385, Manager Jack McKeon said that enough 
was enough. 
</P>
<P>
His team had just lost to Houston, 3-2, in front of 17,199 in the Astrodome. 
The loss, their fifth in the past six games, was the kind that has been trying 
McKeon's patience. 
</P>
<P>
It was another case of the Padres not only stranding runners but leaving them 
in scoring position. More than once, the culprit was a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres left nine runners on base and stranded one in scoring position in 
all but two innings. Three times, scoring chances were ended by a strikeout. 
This after they left 12 men on base in a 7-4, 10-inning loss Tuesday night and 
struck out to end four innings with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
It all helped launch McKeon into a controlled but pointed lecture on the value 
of making contact. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put the ball in play in some of those times, you never know, they might 
make a mistake, they might boot a ball," McKeon said. "We've been striking out 
too much with men on base." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon had a ready explanation for the excess of strikeouts -- including the 
eight Wednesday -- but no instant cure. 
</P>
<P>
"How do I explain it? Guys having no idea of what the situation is," McKeon 
said. "I guess you can teach it, but it has got to come at an earlier age than 
right up at this level." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon cited Tuesday's loss in which the Astros tied the game in the ninth with 
the help of four consecutive walks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys wouldn't let them do that," McKeon said. "We're going to hack away 
and swing at first pitches. Some guys you can help; some guys, it is a hopeless 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to McKeon's frustration was that most of the chances came against Astro 
starter Mike Scott. Except for yielding two runs in the second, Scott was able 
to pitch out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"When you got Scott out there, you have got to cash in early," McKeon said. "We 
had plenty of chances -- we just have to get somebody to come through in the 
clutch in a close game." 
</P>
<P>
Scott lasted until he walked Jack Clark to start the eighth, long enough to 
earn the victory. That raised his record to 10-3 as he joined Rick Reuschel of 
San Francisco and Dave Stewart of Oakland as a 10-game winner in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Scott's third in six days. He beat the Dodgers, 1-0, Friday, 
and pitched one inning of relief Sunday in a 7-6 victory over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres wasted another respectable performance by starter Walt Terrell (4-7, 
3.47 ERA). He allowed three runs on seven hits, struck out two and walked one 
in eight innings. But he took the loss after allowing consecutive two-out RBI 
hits in the sixth -- a triple by Glenn Davis and a double by Terry Puhl. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, 1-5 on this 10-game trip, dropped to .500 (30-30) for the first 
time since they were 21-21 after a 6-5 victory in Montreal on May 17. The 
Padres remained fourth in the National League West, four games out of first, 
but slid to within a half game of the fifth-place Dodgers. And they are missing 
a fine pennant race going on above them. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' victory, their 12th in past 13 games, combined with Cincinnati's 
12-5 victory over San Francisco to create nearly a three-way tie for first in 
the division. The Reds (32-24, .571) technically are first, percentage points 
ahead of the Astros and Giants (both 33-25, .569). 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who had not beaten Scott in 12 Astrodome decisions before a 5-4 
victory April 9, jumped on him for two runs in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell opened with a single to center. Roberto Alomar doubled him to third 
with one out. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros opted to load the bases by intentionally walking Tony Gwynn, who had 
singled in his first at-bat to extend his hitting streak to nine games. But the 
strategy failed when Clark singled to center, scoring Terrell and Alomar for a 
2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Scott got out of further trouble when Marvell Wynne fouled to first and Benito 
Santiago flied to right. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros got a run back in their half of the inning when catcher Alex Trevino 
scored from third on Gerald Young's one-out grounder to second. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros went ahead, 3-2, on Davis' triple, which bounced off the base of the 
wall just to the right of the 400-foot mark in straight-away center field. That 
scored Billy Hatcher, who singled to left to leadoff the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scored when Puhl lined a double to center. It the second double of the 
game for Puhl, who entered as a .167 lifetime hitter (two for 12) against 
Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, meanwhile, hit his stride after the Padres' two-run third. 
</P>
<P>
He did allow three doubles over the next four innings, but the Padres could not 
score. They wasted two-out doubles by Gwynn in the fifth (Clark ended the 
inning with a strikeout) and Chris James in the sixth (Garry Templeton popped 
to second). 
</P>
<P>
Terrell opened the seventh with a double to right center that eluded Young. But 
Scott stranded Terrell, who eventually reached third, by retiring Luis Salazar 
and Alomar on ground outs and getting Gwynn to fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was replaced by Dan Schatzeder after he walked Clark to start the eighth. 
Schatzeder was the first of three relievers who combined to retire six of the 
final seven Padres in the eighth and ninth on two popups, three strikeouts and 
a grounder to first. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Smith pitched the ninth to earn his 11th save. He allowed a one-out single 
to pinch-hitter Tim Flannery but struck out pinch-hitter Rob Nelson and Alomar 
to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to cash in," McKeon said. "We are getting the opportunities. We 
have just got to capitalize. Somebody has got to come to the front beside Tony 
Gwynn and Jack Clark and knock in some key runs." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting time for tonight's game in Houston has been moved 30 minutes to 5:05 
PDT to accommodate an ABC regional telecast. The game will be carried live in 
San Diego on Channel 10 (although it probably will be joined in progress after 
a speech by President Bush). Eric Show (6-6) will make his third attempt at 
breaking the Padre record for career victories. He is tied with Randy Jones 
with 92. Show will opposed by Bob Knepper (3-6). . . . Jack Clark's four walks 
Tuesday tied the club record accomplished seven times, most recently by Tim 
Flannery against Cincinnati on Oct. 3, 1985. But Clark went hitless in his 
other two at-bats, ending a 10-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes, the Padres' No. 1 draft choice last season, lost for the second 
time in nine decisions at double-A Wichita. Benes pitched six innings, allowed 
three runs (two earned) and six hits, struck out three and walked two in 
Wichita's 4-2 loss to Midland. Benes' ERA moved up to 1.14. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon said he generally plans to replace third baseman 
Chris James with Luis Salazar when the Padres are ahead late in a game, as he 
did Wednesday night in the sixth, for defensive purposes. James, acquired from 
Philadelphia last week, has played most of his career in the outfield and moved 
to left when Salazar came in (Marvell Wynne moved from left to right and Bip 
Roberts left the game).

CHATSWORTH DRAFT TOTAL GROWS TO 4; 
</P>
<P>
TORONTO TAKES JOHNSON, PIRATES SELECT WALLACE WITH LATE-ROUND PICKS 
</P>

<P>
The number of Chatsworth High players chosen in baseball's amateur draft 
reached four Wednesday when Eric Johnson and Derek Wallace learned that they 
had been picked in the late rounds of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a catcher and designated-hitter, was taken by Toronto. Wallace, a 
pitcher and first baseman, was selected by Pittsburgh. On the first day of the 
draft Monday, Pittsburgh took Chatsworth third baseman Rich Aude in the second 
round and the Chicago Cubs picked shortstop-pitcher Jason Evans in the fourth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth posted a 21-7 record and won its ninth consecutive league title this 
season, but lost for the third year in a row in the semifinals of the City 
Section 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Johnson nor Wallace said he knew in which round he was selected -- and 
neither asked club officials when contacted. It seems unlikely that either will 
sign a professional contract. Johnson has signed a letter of intent with Cal 
State Northridge and Wallace has signed with Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone from Toronto called and told me I was taken and I didn't even ask 
which round," Johnson said. "It didn't concern me. I'm set at CSUN. I want to 
have three good years there and wait to be drafted again. Then they can give me 
$100,000." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Pittsburgh drafted Wallace as a shortstop, a position he played 
as a junior but not at all this season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson transferred to Chatsworth from Michigan for his senior season. He 
batted .365 with three home runs and 37 runs batted in. Wallace was named the 
West Valley League Most Valuable Player after compiling a 9-3 record with a 
1.92 earned-run average. He also batted .344 with four home runs, 22 RBIs and 
10 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gieseke, a 1985 Westlake High graduate, was one of six Cal State 
Sacramento players selected in the draft when he was picked Tuesday by San 
Diego sometime after the 20th round. 
</P>
<P>
Gieseke, 22, a senior switch-hitting first baseman and a two-time All-American, 
is scheduled to report Saturday to the club's Class-A affiliate in Spokane, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Gieseke said that San Diego team officials would not specify in which round he 
had been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know too much about what's going on, I wish I did," said 
Gieseke, who batted .372 with team-high totals of nine home runs and 45 RBIs 
for the Hornets, who spent part of the season ranked No. 1 in the nation among 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little in the dark right now," Gieseke added. "But I'm happy I have a 
chance this year. And I'd better take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Gieseke, who batted .467 as a senior at Westlake, played one season at both 
Valley College and College of the Canyons before transferring to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi High catcher John Dempsey (6-foot, 185 pounds), son of veteran major 
league catcher Rick Dempsey, was selected Monday by the St. Louis Cardinals in 
the 10th round. Dempsey batted .302 with six extra-base hits and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Allen, a 1985 Calabasas High graduate, was selected in the 10th round 
Monday by the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Allen (6-1, 180), a senior third baseman at Loyola Marymount, played one year 
at Moorpark College and two years with the now-defunct Valley Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Allen led Loyola with 11 home runs, 60 RBIs and 22 stolen bases 
while batting .322. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Wheatcroft, a senior pitcher for Cal State Northridge, was picked by 
Baltimore on Tuesday in the 32nd round. Wheatcroft led the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. with 11 wins this season.

SIX DOMINGUEZ BASEBALL, SOFTBALL PLAYERS HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three baseball players and three softball players from Cal State Dominguez 
Hills have received Division II All-Western Regional honors. 
</P>
<P>
Senior pitcher Rick Davis, who led the nation in strikeouts, was voted to the 
first team, as were softball players Maria Romero and Jennifer Boen. 
</P>
<P>
Second-team honors went to a pair of seniors, baseball third baseman Ruben 
Jauregui and softball pitcher Denise Biller. Rob Campbell, a junior center 
fielder, received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a right-hander, posted a 7-7 record on a team that finished in last 
place in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. (16-29-2). But his 171 
strikeouts led the nation and broke a 19-year CCAA record. He was drafted 
Monday by the San Diego Padres in the seventh round. Davis, who played 
shortstop as a junior, completed 11 games with three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, a junior outfielder, set a school record with 27 runs batted in. Boen, 
a freshman utility player, drove in 18 runs and was 4-1 as a pitcher. She 
posted an 0.40 earned-run average, which helped the Lady Toros advance to the 
Western Regional Tournament on the strength of the school's best record 
(35-22-1). 
</P>
<P>
Despite an injury-plagued season, Jauregui batted .340 with five home runs and 
24 RBIs. The fleet Campbell led Toro starters with a .352 average, .445 on-base 
percentage, 12 stolen bases and five assists from the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Biller, a right-hander, was 15-11 with a 0.63 ERA.

<P>
The San Fernando Valley Saltwater Angling Club, competing Sunday in the Heal 
the Bay tournament sponsored by the Santa Monica Yacht Club, was awarded a 
trophy for catching a limit of calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Stevenson of San Fernando received the sand bass award with his 5-pound, 
7-ounce catch. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven clubs and 88 anglers participated in the tournament and Top Rod Club 
awards were given on a points system. The Douglas El Segundo Rod and Gun Club 
won the halibut division with six 12-pounders. Second place went to the Los 
Angeles Rod and Gun Club for the most calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The individual Top Rod award went to Ellsworth Orr, fishing from his kayak. He 
won with a limit of calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
Participants raised $800 for the Heal the Bay Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Shark hunt: The Channel Islands Yacht Club held a shark derby Sunday. Anglers 
found most of the action in an area south of Anacapa Island's west end. The 
winner was Russ Garrison of Oxnard, fishing from his boat Sea Russler. He 
hooked an 88 1/2-pound mako. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Crow of Oxnard, fishing on the Scuba Do, finished second with a 78 
1/2-pound blue shark. Virgil Lockhart on the Ranger II landed a 66-pound blue 
shark to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing outside the Fifth Street power plant in the Oxnard Beach surf, Leo 
Garcia of Ventura caught a limit of perch. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Foy of Oxnard, fishing aboard the Erna B at Santa Cruz Island, won the 
jackpot with an 18-pound ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fuji of Panorama City, fishing the outer island, won the jackpot aboard the 
Eagle.

Catching on: Once again squid is the determining factor in hooking white sea 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
The one-fish limit on white sea bass ends a week from today. Starting June 16, 
anglers may keep three a day. 
</P>
<P>
Using floodlights off Catalina Island, the El Dorado out of Long Beach 
Sportfishing brought to the surface enough squid to fill the bait tanks. At 
daybreak, 25 anglers tossed squid into the kelp and the result was a wide-open 
calico bass and barracuda bite. By fishing the bottom, they were able to hook 
their quarry. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Weiss of Mar Vista caught the whopper of the week, a 36-pound white sea 
bass, fishing in Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Franks of San Pedro, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Freedom, won 
the jackpot with a 32-pound white sea bass.

Nick Powers of Gardena won the jackpot aboard the Victory with a stray 15-pound 
salmon while Bob Miller of San Pedro caught an 11-pound halibut aboard the 
Annie B barge. 
</P>
<P>

NEWHALL-SAUGUS WINS BEHIND VERSATILE WARR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Warr hit seven home runs last season for Saugus High and was 8-2 as a 
pitcher. Switching uniforms didn't seem to make much difference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Warr, a senior left-hander, pitched a five-hitter and hit a game-ending two-run 
home run in the sixth inning to lead Newhall-Saugus (Santa Clarita) to a 14-3 
win over Lancaster in an American Legion District 20 Northern Division game at 
Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
Warr (1-0) allowed two earned runs, struck out two and walked two. His home run 
in the sixth gave Saugus an 11-run lead, ending the game by virtue of the mercy 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Every player in the starting lineup hit safely for Newhall-Saugus (2-0). 
Darrell Davis had two doubles, Ben Ealy had two hits and two runs batted in, 
and Brad Anderson and George Lopata each had two hits for the three-time 
defending Northern Division champion. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 3-0, Newhall-Saugus scored 10 runs in the fourth inning and two runs 
in each of the fifth and sixth to blow the game open. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 11, Van Nuys-Notre Dame 1 -- Right-hander Mark Williams, a 
freshman from Tufts University in Medford, Mass., threw a three-hitter, struck 
out eight and walked four in an Eastern Division game at North Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Martinez had two doubles and a triple and Rene Gomez had four RBIs for 
North Hollywood (2-1). Teammate Sammy Ciaramilaro was two for four. 
</P>
<P>
Short-handed Van Nuys-Notre Dame, the two-time defending District 20 champion, 
fell to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley 4, Panorama City 3 -- Trailing, 3-2, in the bottom of the seventh, 
Sun Valley scored twice to win an Eastern Division game at Poly High. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, third baseman Marlin McKinney -- who was three for three -- 
singled. One out later, Shad Martinez bunted for a base hit to put runners on 
first and second. Robert Flores followed with an RBI single to left, scoring 
McKinney. Martinez scored the winning run when the throw to the plate skipped 
past Panorama City catcher Adam Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Eddie Castellanos (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings of relief 
for Sun Valley (3-1). Left-hander Sean Henson took the loss for Panorama City 
(2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills (West) 17, West Hills 1 -- Lance Gibson threw a five-hitter, 
walked none and struck out five in a Western Division game at El Camino Real 
High that was called after five innings because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Banuelos, Paul Geller, Bobby Kim, Ryan McGuire and Lance Gibson each had 
two hits for Woodland Hills (3-0), which scored six runs in the second and 
eight runs in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank 3, Reseda 2 -- With a chance to take himself off the hook for the loss, 
Reseda right-hander Mario Valencia flied out to center with a runner on third 
in the bottom of the seventh in an inter-division game at Reseda High. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, who walked four batters in the first inning to force in a run and who 
committed an error in the fourth that led to another score, fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank is 3-1, Reseda is 2-2.

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: IT'S DOLLARS 1ST, DESIGN 2ND AT CCDC;

Who's wearing the pants when it comes to downtown redevelopment? 
</P>
<P>
The Centre City Development Corp.'s approval last month of a 36-story luxury 
condominium tower shows that the financial viability of a project often takes 
precedence over urban design concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Going against the advice of its design specialists, the CCDC granted exclusive 
negotiating rights for the high-rise project to the Koll Co.-Davidson 
Communities team. It will be built at the southwestern corner of State Street 
and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Architect Mike Stepner and CCDC urban-design expert Max Schmidt both 
objected to the height of Koll's project, known as the Huntington and designed 
by San Diego architects Lorimer-Case. Even CCDC board President John Davies had 
reservations about its 472-foot height, which will make it one of the two or 
three tallest buildings downtown, dwarfing its immediate neighbors: the 
20-story Koll Center just to the west, the mid-rise Columbia Tower seniors 
housing project to the south and the six-story Hotel San Diego to the east. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Argument 
</P>
<P>
Approval came only after the CCDC's economic consultants, Keyser Marston, 
stated that a 10-story reduction in the building's height 'would materially 
affect the feasibility of the project.' Potential buyers of the $300,000 to $1 
million homes, according to Davies, would only be lured by a landmark building. 
Apparently nothing less than 36 stories would do. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Smyk, the developer of the Meridian, San Diego's existing luxury high-rise 
condo tower, doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
"A landmark building doesn't sell condos," he said. "A landmark building has 
more value for office prestige than condos. The important things are the views 
and the interior layouts. My opinion is the best views in the Meridian are on 
the 12th or 15th floors. I live on the 24th, and it's too high. There's no 
relationship to the street or other activities. The higher you go, the views 
almost get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Also, there aren't that many buyers for such pricey condos. What if Smyk, who's 
sold 130 of 172 luxury units in the Meridian in four years and may find his 
project competing with Koll's when it comes on line, has already tapped out the 
market? 
</P>
<P>
If a lower luxury condo tower simply didn't appeal to developers, why not a 
different brand of project? 
</P>
<P>
Competing developer A. J. Lirot's proposed 400-foot rental apartment tower was 
more in scale with the neighborhood. The architecture wasn't everyone's 
favorite, but the size was right on. CCDC felt the Koll team was stronger 
financially, and wasn't swayed when Lirot brought in high-powered developer 
Trammell Crow as a partner after the submissions deadline. 
</P>
<P>
A look at CCDC's original request for proposals (RFP) for the State and 
Broadway site, and subsequent alterations to it, show that CCDC was resigned 
months ago to a building the size of the Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The first RFP asked for a building matching the adjacent Koll Center in scale. 
In November, under pressure from the Koll team, CCDC decided to permit a 
building of 600,000 square feet on a site that, by some interpretations of 
CCDC's guidelines, should have accommodated about half that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flip-Flop Decisions 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington occupies only part of a larger piece of redevelopment land 
referred to as "Parcel C," which also includes the Koll Center and the Columbia 
Tower. In simple terms, the CCDC decided that, because the Koll Center wasn't 
built to the maximum allowable height for Parcel C, the new condo tower would 
be allowed to use up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Such flip-flops are what will determine whether we get a hospitable downtown 
with ample glimpses of blue sky and sunlight or a Manhattan-like urban core 
where giant buildings dwarf the scale of smaller nearby structures. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Great American Plaza, under construction across Broadway a few blocks 
west of the Huntington will be of equal height. But, from the northern side of 
Broadway, it won't cast shadows on downtown's most significant street. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Stepner commented on the Huntington, "When you're a block away, you 
will see the relationship between the various buildings and will notice the 
height. It's not a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
Since the '60s, the CCDC's Schmidt, in various capacities as a city planner, 
has favored locating downtown's tallest buildings near Interstate 5 and Cortez 
Hill, site of the El Cortez Hotel. In his ideal scenario, they would have 
decreased in height closer to the water, giving most downtown offices and 
residences good bay views and keeping the waterfront free from a wall of 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
But '60s and '70s high-rises were built in the heart of downtown. Now, with the 
intense development of lower Broadway, including not only the Huntington but 
the Great American project and the 30-story Emerald Shapery Center nearby, 
along with hotel and residential towers along Harbor Drive, Schmidt's fantasy 
is being reversed, with the tallest buildings closest to the water. 
</P>
<P>
If CCDC is willing to let economics double the size of Koll's building, what 
will happen in the '90s when a huge new wave of high-rise proposals comes in 
for the substantial properties near the water owned by Santa Fe (the railroad 
company) and the Navy? 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that height got out of hand at the Huntington, because, in other 
ways, it shows just how much progress the CCDC is making in getting good 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residential Character 
</P>
<P>
Unlike existing downtown high-rises, this one has a base, middle and a 
distinctive top the architects hope to sheath in copper. The base is scaled to 
match older nearby buildings such as the YMCA and Hotel San Diego, both in 
height and detailing, with the tower set back from the base. Altogether, the 
design, as Schmidt noted in his design analysis, gives the building a 
distinctly residential character apart from downtown's office high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
With CCDC giving Koll a discount on land the public agency has owned for 
several years, San Diegans have a right to expect the highest urban design 
standards, even if they won't be able to afford a home there. Koll bid $2 
million for the land, valued by a downtown real estate expert at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stepner believes a smaller building, even a condominium tower, could have been 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the fine points of the deal, but, from my experience over the 
years, I know that each developer will take the same exact situation and create 
a different deal that works for him. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: James Hubbell, Gerrit Greve, Ed Pieters, Malcolm Leland are among 
more than 60 artists participating in the Art Auction being presented by the 
New School of Architecture's Class of '89 on June 10 at 7 p.m., 1249 F. St., 
downtown San Diego. Part of the proceeds go to the school. . . . The La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art's show on architect Emilio Ambasz opens June 11. . . 
. San Diego architect Chuck Slert won two of nine 1989 design awards presented

THE BENEFITS OF A RARE BENEFIT -- CHILD CARE AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERRI SENDERS, Senders is a Van Nuys free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every weekday morning, Edith and Kevin Porter travel 30 miles from their home 
in Walnut to Glendale Adventist Memorial Hospital. And every weekday morning, 
they are accompanied by their 19-month-old daughter Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
Edith, a nurse whose shift in the maternity ward starts at 6:30 a.m., is the 
first to be dropped off. Then Kevin, a financial analyst in the business 
office, takes Ashley to the hospital's child-care center in two stucco 
bungalows across the parking lot from the main building. He kisses his daughter 
goodby and is at his desk by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Not every two-career family has such an ideal situation. But as the ranks of 
working mothers continue to grow, so do corporate concerns about child care. 
More than 5,000 companies nationwide offer some kind of child-care benefits, up 
from 415 employers in 1982, according to a recent survey by Burud &amp; 
Associates, a national child-care consulting firm based in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
More than 935 U.S. companies offer their own day-care centers or share them 
with another employer. These programs are convenient and reliable, parents say. 
And they know that they can be at their child's side in minutes and can visit 
any time during the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Fortunate 
</P>
<P>
Many of the parents at Glendale Adventist and other on-site or nearby day-care 
centers in the San Fernando Valley area say they are fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"The child-care center is one of the biggest pluses of this job," said Coco 
Ortiz, a pharmacist at Glendale Adventist who has a 3-year-old son and 
1-year-old daughter at the center and a 5-year-old son who graduated last year. 
"I don't know how other mothers cope without on-site care." 
</P>
<P>
"Quality child care is rare. And if you do find it, it's usually all filled 
up," said Lynn Yaden, a physical therapy supervisor at Glendale Adventist with 
a 4-year-old son in the program and a 5-year-old son in kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
Although only a few companies in the Valley sponsor child-care centers, those 
that do are convinced that they benefit in the long run. Studies have indicated 
that on-site care helps reduce absenteeism, increases employee productivity, 
and attracts and keeps quality personnel. Burud &amp; Associates, which 
recently completed a cost-benefit study of Union Bank's on-site center in 
Monterey Park, found that the bank saved between $138,000 and $232,000 its 
first year in reduced turnover, absenteeism and shortened maternity leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Said Karl Brower, Glendale Adventist's director of human resources: "The 
overall feeling is the child-care center is a stress reliever for parents. 
Supervisors say the parents can be more relaxed at work because they don't have 
to run home or worry about their kids." 
</P>
<P>
And unlike baby-sitters, child-care centers don't take days off, call in sick 
or go on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Who takes your kids then?" Yaden asked. "The day-care center is much more 
reliable and consistent. So I can promise I can be at work rather than running 
around trying to place my kids somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Even if her son becomes ill, Yaden said, "the center calls me and I can run 
over and make an assessment if I have to take him home right away or he can 
hold out for a few more hours." If need be, Yaden said, she can keep her sick 
child next to her on the office floor for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Like many parents, Yaden is only too familiar with child-care woes. When her 
older son's after-school caretaker decided to quit, it took her 1 1/2 months to 
find another program. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, I had to work a split shift so I could stay home with him 
after kindergarten in the afternoons. When my husband came home in the evening, 
he took over and I went back to work." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Kilby, a marketing director for Glendale Adventist, appreciates the 
flexibility that the child-care center offers her. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm at a conference and going to be delayed, they'll feed my two kids 
dinner. For me it's made a two-career family possible." 
</P>
<P>
Open from 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. during the week, the Glendale facility can take 
up to 42 children. The waiting list has about 40 names. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital subsidizes up to 15% of the tuition, which is $110 a week for 
infants and $78 for children 2 to 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
At Warner Center in Woodland Hills, a number of businesses, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District and Cal State Northridge opened the Warner Center 
Institute for Family Development, a 55-slot facility close to the area's many 
office buildings. Tuition is $425 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I take my daughter out to lunch once a week and we both love it," said Teresa 
Lima, an analyst for a health maintainance organization. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure on women in careers to do it like men and not worry 
about their kids. But I can't," said Lyn Philipps, an attorney with a Warner 
Center law firm who eats lunch with her 2-year-old son, Brendon, twice a week. 
"I feel much more comfortable knowing I can be there in an emergency and see 
him when I want. It makes me more productive at work." 
</P>
<P>
On-site or nearby child-care centers can be a very powerful recruitment tool, 
personnel directors said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get twice as many phone calls from our recruitment ads when we mention we 
have a child-care center," said Darla Phelps, personnel director at Simi Valley 
Adventist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley hospital's nearby child-care center, Family Connections, has 75 
slots for infants, preschoolers and children who need after-school care. It 
gives them a "good edge in a competitive market," said Brent Edgerton, hospital 
marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
The popular day-care program, open weekdays from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., has more 
than 35 names on its waiting list. Tuition for Simi Adventist employees, sold 
in blocks of 10-, 20-, 30- or 40-hour increments, is subsidized close to 25% by 
the hospital. Forty hours is $84.80 for infants and $65.60 for preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one more way to attract and keep employees," Edgerton said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Brower agrees. "Although we still have a shortage of nurses, we're 
not in the same dire straits as other hospitals. We've definitely hired 
employees that we normally wouldn't have been able to because of our child-care 
center," he said. And, he added, the center has helped him hold onto a few 
employees too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had other job offers for better money and better positions, but I've 
turned them down," Ortiz said. "I think about what I went through trying to 
find a good child-care center and now my kids are settled. Even if I went to 
another employer with an on-site center, I'd be low on the priority list."

RELAY OPERATORS IN WARNER CENTER CONNECT THE DEAF TO HEARING WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the first telephone call California Relay Service received only moments 
after it was activated one minute after midnight Jan. 1, 1987, manager Phyllis 
Shapiro had a feeling that the operation for deaf and speech-impaired telephone 
users was going to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
"A Northern California deaf woman was our first call. She was in labor and 
needed to reach her husband at work so he could take her to the hospital," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With the operator repeating his every word, the husband instructed his wife on 
the necessary breathing exercises over the phone. A week later, CRS received a 
note from the couple, who had made it to the hospital on time and were then the 
parents of a baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
CRS was the first statewide 24-hour-a-day service in the country to provide 
access through an 800 number -- there are now others in New York and Alabama. 
Its sole function is to give hearing- and speech-impaired people telephone 
access, with operators who act as their ears and voices. 
</P>
<P>
"After experiencing CRS, I just cannot imagine ever being without it," said 
Simi Valley resident Norma Chrismon, 59, through a CRS operator. "I can make my 
own airline reservations or get direct information from my doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Chrismon also uses CRS in her job as a payroll clerk for the Retail Clerks 
Union local 770 in Los Angeles, where she has worked for 23 years. Before the 
service was available, her co-workers made calls for her, which were sometimes 
subject to unintentional translation. Now, every word she types into her TDD, 
which stands for Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, is repeated verbatim 
by the operator, who also types every word spoken to her from the other party. 
</P>
<P>
"Since CRS, I make all my own business calls and all my own decisions. I make 
my own mistakes, too. It is a good feeling to know that I can do all those 
things without depending upon anybody. It would not be possible before," 
Chrismon said. 
</P>
<P>
Before relay services, which began on a primitive level about 20 years ago, 
deaf and speech-impaired people could only call each other. Using TDDs, a 
miniature Teletype, messages could be typed to another TDD over conventional 
telephone lines. But hearing people without machines couldn't talk to them, and 
vice versa. Enter a relay service, which has operators equipped with 
conventional telephone equipment as well as TDDs enabling them to talk to both 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relay Process 
</P>
<P>
When a speaking and hearing person calls CRS, he is connected to a 
"communications assistant." The assistant will then dial the TDD party. Every 
word spoken to the assistant is teletyped, and every teletyped word is spoken 
to the hearing party. 
</P>
<P>
Deep inside a security building near Oxnard Street and De Soto Avenue in Warner 
Center in Woodland Hills, each CRS operator may handle as many as 100 calls per 
shift. The service, which fields calls from throughout the state, will 
sometimes handle up to 8,700 calls per day. To accommodate the load, as many as 
85 operators work peak daytime shifts, where up to 600 calls an hour will be 
handled. As few as four operators are on duty to handle the trickle of calls in 
the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the basic doctor, dentist and hair appointment calls, operators do 
everything from singing Happy Birthday to repeating comments from someone 
wanting to commit suicide. They relay arguments between alcoholics, continually 
redial lovers during spats where one side is hanging up on the other and tell 
pizzerias to hold the anchovies. Operators said they don't remember any 
marriage proposals but there have been a number of propositions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeat It All 
</P>
<P>
"It's life just like anyone else's," said operator Loren DePhillips, 36, about 
the diversity of calls, including those who curse during their conversation. 
When DePhillips has to repeat foul language, he does so loudly so the other 
operators can hear. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes in your ears and goes out your fingers," he said. "No matter what 
they're saying, you just repeat it. Some of it gets a little gross at times, 
but life isn't all flowers and roses." 
</P>
<P>
DePhillips, who is blind, works his terminal with the aid of a Braille 
translator that he reads with his fingers, his "eyes," a 5-year-old Labrador 
retriever named Skip, patiently lying on the floor next to him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the toughest calls operator Margo O'Connell, 55, ever had to relay was 
telling someone that his daughter, in her mid-30s, was dying of cancer. 
O'Connell tried to stay calm. "By the time I was through I was crying," she 
said of the half-hour telephone call she transmitted word-for-word. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year of start-up, equipment and staffing had doubled at CRS. 
Currently, about 250,000 calls a month are handled by 215 operators, and the 
service is funded through the monthly surcharge for "Communication Devices 
Funds for Deaf and Disabled" that appears on everyone's monthly phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, CRS can make calls only inside the state. Interstate calls are 
handled by a number of smaller, privately funded relay services that place 
specific limits on operating hours and time allotments for each call, unlike 
CRS. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Schreiber, a deaf Santa Barbara travel agent who runs Herbtours for the 
deaf and speech impaired, said that besides being able to make his own doctor 
and dental appointments, he can talk directly to tour organizers. "CRS repeats 
all my words verbatim. 
</P>
<P>
Before, I had to depend on people who would change words or meanings." 
</P>
<P>
Most CRS operators admitted that the job, which pays from $298 to $470 per 
week, can be repetitive, and Shapiro said she is seeing signs of burnout in 
some senior members on her staff. Many find the satisfaction that they get from 
being an operator -- AT&amp;T officially calls them "communication assistants" 
-- more than makes up for the tedium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Satisfaction 
</P>
<P>
Louis Sapienza, 27, a two-year-veteran of CRS, said he gets satisfaction from 
assisting the community. "There is a uniform way that we do our job, but each 
call is completely different from the next." And some, he acknowledged, can be 
awkward, such as his very first call on the job, talking to a gynecologist. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the heartbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Operator Anna Stoll, 33, remembered calling an information line on cancer for a 
father with a sick child, which started her thinking of her own daughter, who 
had recently gone through chemotherapy. "I cried through the whole call but I 
wouldn't give it up," she said. "You're not supposed to get attached to the 
calls, but it's hard not to sometimes."

"We also get people who just call their friends and family to say hi," 
DePhillips said. "The best call I ever relayed was someone who said, 'Just 
called to say I love you.' I wish I would have more of those."

IN MINI-MALLS ACROSS THE VALLEY, VIETNAMESE REFUGEES FIND THEIR NICHE AS 
MANICURISTS

Tammie Ly reveled in her good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
As the Studio City entrepreneur sailed in the door of her bustling 2-year-old 
business -- Tammie's Nail Salon -- she was showered with a confetti of hellos 
from customers eager to see the latest symbol of her success -- a two-carat 
diamond ring from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very lucky," said Ly, 25, sitting at the manicuring table where she 
can be found 12 hours a day, six days a week (no holidays, no vacations, no 
coffee breaks). "I am lucky to be alive, lucky to very much love my life here." 
She added: "I am so lucky to be in the United States, it makes me cry." 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, Tammie Ly was getting married in a Thai refugee camp to another 
Vietnamese refugee. They had $10 between them and were able to immigrate to the 
United States only after a church in Virginia sponsored them. 
</P>
<P>
Today she earns about $100 a day. Like many of the Vietnamese refugees who have 
settled in the Los Angeles area since 1976, Ly has found a comfortable niche in 
the nail trade. She and her colleagues have found a way to realize the American 
dream in a booming business that requires relatively little start-up capital 
and only a few hundred hours of training. And the evidence of their success can 
be found in mini-malls across the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Said one local manicurist: "When you bump into a nail shop every two feet along 
Ventura Boulevard, you don't have to be bounced off the turnip truck to know 
everyone coming here wants into the beauty business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$932-Million Business 
</P>
<P>
According to the New York-based trade publication American Salon, 139.9 million 
manicures, pedicures and artificial nail services were provided in the United 
States last year, generating $932 million in business. That kind of money has 
attracted thousands of Southern Californians. According to the state Board of 
Cosmetology, the number of licensed manicurists in Los Angeles County has 
increased by more than 50% in the last five years -- from 9,755 in June, 1984, 
to 15,238. And industry observers agree that the business has a special appeal 
for Vietnamese immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Vietnamese immigrants have the idea that running their own business is 
ideal," said Hao Doan, 35, program coordinator of the Southeast Asian Community 
Center in Van Nuys. "In Vietnam, most small businesses are owned by women. They 
come here and want to do the same." 
</P>
<P>
Said Victoria Wurdinger, senior editor at American Salon: "These immigrants 
don't have any cultural attitude about 'Madge the Manicurist.' To them, it's a 
very glamorous profession compared with being a maid or a garment worker." And, 
she added, "It's a profession where the faster and harder you work, the more 
money you make." 
</P>
<P>
Tammie Ly owns a red convertible BMW and a North Hollywood house painted "sexy 
American" pink inside, and sends her 8-year-old daughter, Annie, to a private 
school. "I very much enjoy my life," she said. "This money is enough for me!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A $1,000 Life' 
</P>
<P>
"If you work $300 a month, you have a $300 apartment, a $300 car and a $300 
life," said Studio City nail salon owner Sandy Ly, 41. "If you work $1,000 a 
month, you have a $1,000 life." 
</P>
<P>
Some Vietnamese refugees embraced the nail business when they discovered that 
their job opportunities in the United States were limited by a language or 
education gap. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks manicurist Susan Nguyen, 35, is a former chemistry teacher who 
says she spent 11 months in a Vietnamese jail after she was caught trying to 
flee the country. "I was so afraid when I came," she said. "Everything was 
very, very strange and different -- and big. And I didn't speak English. I 
didn't know how I'd do here. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here I didn't know what to do. My sister-in-law told me to study 
the nail. I did it because I didn't have an idea. She had friends who did 
nails. She said it may be easier than another job, than computers." 
</P>
<P>
"Going to job interviews is impossible," said Sandy Ly. "They ask you so many 
things you don't understand and you have to lie. They say, 'Do you have 
experience?' and you say, 'Oh, yes!' But no. It's terrible. We're used to 
telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Local cosmetology schools report an influx of Vietnamese students in the last 
five years. A spokesman for the Marinello School of Beauty, a chain with 16 
facilities, including one in Reseda and another in North Hollywood, said 
Vietnamese make up about 40% of all students, compared to 2% 10 years ago. Many 
schools offer the 10-week manicuring course -- mandatory for state licensing -- 
in Vietnamese (as well as Thai, Korean, Spanish, Japanese and other languages). 
The state allows manicurists-to-be to bring along an interpreter for the 
licensing exam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Diploma 
</P>
<P>
"Manicuring is one of the few professions people can enter without so much as a 
high school diploma," said Jeff Weir, assistant executive officer with the 
cosmetology board, which requires that professional manicurist applicants be 17 
and have 350 hours of training in an accredited beauty school. "And we don't 
want to change that." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mary Jo Price, 53, a Studio City cosmetologist, manicuring is 
"nothing but a personality business. If you can do a good set of nails and 
you've got a good personality, you've got it made. Sometimes you don't even 
have to do good nails." 
</P>
<P>
The customer "doesn't care if you speak English well," Tammie Ly said. 
"Sometimes they even like to teach you." 
</P>
<P>
Low capitalization is another plus. With an investment of about $1,500 in 
equipment -- a table, chair and tools -- and as little as $800 a month rent for 
a mini-mall spot, many manicurists are rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the weakness of the landlord, a nail shop can go in for no money 
down and six months free rent just to fill the place," said Bob Heyman, a 
Valley real estate developer whose corner malls are home to growing numbers of 
nail salons. "These businesses satisfy the need for the 
</P>
<P>
instant market. You have the instant dry cleaner, the instant doughnut and, 
now, the instant nail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition Stiff 
</P>
<P>
Some owners of more established salons say they are feeling the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"They're working circles around us," said Price, who added that she has worked 
hard not to lose customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me wonder if we need to re-evaluate our customers. Maybe we haven't 
been appreciative enough, made them feel cherished enough. Maybe we've even 
taken them for granted." 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese shops "have revolutionized the whole idea of having your nails 
done," said Rochelle Nathan, who lives in Studio City and has her nails done at 
Price's salon. "It used to be a luxury. Now it's for everyone -- all the time." 
</P>
<P>
A chichi Encino beauty salon might charge $45 for sculptured nails, $10 for a 
manicure or $40 for Chinese silk nail (a process in which nails are 
strengthened with silk fibers). Vietnamese salons typically charge $25 for 
sculptured nails, $20 for Chinese silk and $12 for the two-in-one special: a 
manicure and a pedicure. In addition, Vietnamese proprietors have a reputation 
for efficiency and long workdays. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of more established salons say efficiency can translate into impersonal 
service. 
</P>
<P>
But Judith Allen, director of Newberry School of Beauty in Granada Hills, which 
has 53 manicuring students, says the Vietnamese in her classes are more 
skilled, more serious and more mindful of perfecting their craft than the 
average student. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Work, Work, Work' 
</P>
<P>
"They become excellent manicurists because they work, work, work and practice," 
Allen said. "They are very concerned about doing everything correctly. They can 
afford to charge less because, as they're so fast, they end up working in 
volume." 
</P>
<P>
Doan says the ability to have their children at work is another reason why 
Vietnamese women are attracted to the profession. 
</P>
<P>
"Manicuring is so suited to the Vietnamese community because the women can keep 
their children with them all day," he said. "They can make flexible hours. They 
spend their time in a good, clean -- even high-class -- environment. It's 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Minh Tran, 32, Tammie Ly's husband, said: "I don't want Tammie to work for 
anyone. I don't want anyone to bother her. I watch the news. I see killings; 
terrible, terrible things. If she went out to a job, I would be very afraid. I 
wouldn't know what would happen to her. 
</P>
<P>
"But with her here," he added, "I feel great. I know where she is. She is with 
clients who are so nice to her. I feel secure." 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to be American; you can do anything you want," said Tammie Ly, who 
has gone California with permed and lightened hair, designer jeans and "tiny 
tops I love because you can see my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she dreams of becoming a doctor to help her ailing mother in Vietnam. 
"But I don't tell people because they'll laugh," she said. "And not now. Now, 
this is what I do because it's the way for Vietnamese women to make money easy. 
This is what I can do. 
</P>
<P>
"And I am very lucky, you know? I love L.A. I keep kissing it all the time."

MORNING REPORT: MURPHY FINDS ROUGH GOING IN HOME MARKET

Is Eddie Murphy slipping in the rental market? It's surprising that his 
blockbuster "Coming to America" -- expected to instantly barge to the top -- is 
only No. 4 after two weeks on the Billboard rental chart. Apparently, the 
competition -- "Cocktail" in particular -- is tougher than expected. "High 
Spirits," starring Darryl Hannah and Peter O'Toole, debuted at No. 21. Critics 
raved about Shirley MacLaine's performance in "Madame Sousatzka," but the movie 
made only $3.3 million. So far it hasn't been a red-hot rental either, crawling 
up one notch to No. 29. 
</P>
<P>
On the sales chart, Michael Jackson changed places with himself. The only video 
with enough clout to bounce "Moonwalker" -- a perennial No. 1 -- out of the top 
spot would be another Jackson title. So his new one, "The Legend Continues," 
No. 2 last week, inched up to No. 1, dropping "Moonwalker" to No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
* "Everybody's All-American," directed by Taylor Hackford, grossed $12.5 
million -- respectable but disappointing for a movie that was expected to be 
big box office. Dennis Quaid plays a football hero fumbling through life, with 
beauty-queen wife (Jessica Lange) leading interference for him. This is the 
kind of star-studded drama -- also featuring John Goodman of TV's "Rosanne" and 
Tim Hutton -- that's usually a rental bonanza. Debuting at No. 15, this one has 
definite Top 5 potential.

FRANKFURT COMPANY INTRODUCES ITS STREET-STYLE BALLET TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, ballet was the torchbearer for contemporary art, but, these days, 
the Anglo-American audience pays handsomely to be insulated from its own time 
-- to be lulled with visions of an Imperial Russian past and to encounter 
modernity, if at all, through the softening filters of neoclassicism, 
neo-romanticism, neo-expressionism, neo-vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the ballets of William Forsythe aren't neo-anything, and that's the first 
shock of seeing his Frankfurt Ballet: watching this 39-year-old American make 
the ballet vocabulary speak powerfully in the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
Abrasive, idiosyncratic, yet somehow deeply familiar, Forsythe's choreography 
has graced a lot of repertories lately. But at the Wiltern Theatre -- where his 
37-dancer company made its West Coast debut Tuesday, courtesy of the Dance 
Gallery's new presenting network -- it isn't a novel change of pace. No, this 
time it is simply all the ballet you're going to get and you'd better be 
prepared to dump any highfalutin notions of nuance, hierarchy or glamour. 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe and his house composer Tom Willems understand the rhythms and 
sonorities of the moment, the information overload, sense of irony and 
simmering frustrations that disconnect urban young people from any soothing 
backdated art. Their work identifies strongly with those young people, maybe 
most of all with their anger. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond anything else, however, their creations harness the energy we find 
stifled in our society and project it so forcefully that the codified steps and 
shapes of ballet fuse with street style and pop dance in potent, liberating 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Created for the Paris Opera Ballet two years ago, "In the Middle, Somewhat 
Elevated" finds the nine-member cast coiled up and kicking out -- but the kicks 
end in positions straight from the classical lexicon, just as the mobility of 
the upper torso and the loose slump-walking come from other idioms entirely. 
Ballet is in the bones of this work, rock 'n' roll in its blood, so as Willems' 
score dramatically thumps and wheezes along, the overlapping solos and duets 
are double-edged. We see an aggressive contemporary sensibility heightened into 
art, and also classical virtuosity freed from courtly manners. 
</P>
<P>
The recent San Francisco Ballet production may be clearer in its 
juxtapositions, but Elizabeth Corbett of the Frankfurt cast need yield to no 
one in stamina or precision as the leggy lady in the pageboy -- the closest 
thing to a ballerina role on the entire program. With its dramatic lunges on 
pointe and intricate contortions, the duet between Maia Rosal and Glen Tuggle 
also typifies the molten virtuosity of this showpiece, a pure statement of 
Forsythe's ability to strip classicism of its cultural accretions yet keep it 
full of feeling. 
</P>
<P>
In "Same Old Story" (1987), Forsythe stages two simultaneous stage events: a 
spoken minidrama at a kitchen table, center, and another of his surging dance 
abstractions for a large corps. The three people at the table and the dancers 
don't notice one another, us or the curtain continually falling and rising in 
front of everyone. Self-absorption is a condition of existence here and we all 
know why. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the dancing relates to the spoken text (normally fairy tales, but on 
this occasion a bizarre collection of newspaper clippings), but that could be 
happenstance. In any case, Forsythe's point seems to lie beyond easy ironies in 
all the big contrasts he sets up: between speech and movement, of course, but 
also between naturalism and classicism, solo and corps dancing, an expansive 
versus an intimate scale. 
</P>
<P>
Distinctive voices are also central -- with small introductory dance solos 
proving as sharply individual as the timbre and accents of the speakers. Once 
again, colorless light from directly overhead re-creates the generalized 
fluorescence of public spaces, but Willems' effects vary from subdued clicks 
and heartbeats to an assaultive blare. 
</P>
<P>
In the audaciously non-balletic "Skinny," we see Forsythe transforming his own 
paranoia into a defiant life-affirming statement. This apocalyptic full-company 
vehicle (a replacement for the scheduled "Questioning of Robert Scott") was 
choreographed by Forsythe and associate Amanda Miller in 1986 after the 
American bombing of Libya and arose from their fears of retaliation against 
Americans abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Thus we see the flicker of offstage fires and people running desperately with 
pails. We hear a text relentlessly evolving from cheery platitudes to a warning 
about dreams going up in smoke. We feel the panic of people at risk -- and yet. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
These hand-clapping, arm-swinging, shadowboxing phalanxes in their loose 
T-shirts, shorts and street shoes are dancing at an awesome pitch, not so much 
consumed as released by the fear that inspired Forsythe and Miller. They are 
fully present, completely alive, incandescent, and in the theater how can we 
ever feel sorry about that?

INTENSITY MISSING IN SAN DIEGO TRAUMA CENTER PRODUCTION

It's more Reality Television. 
</P>
<P>
The KGTV (Channel 10)-produced "Trauma!" scheduled to air today at 10 p.m., 
takes viewers into the University of California, San Diego's Trauma Center for 
24 hours, following in the footsteps of such reality-based shows as "Cops" and 
"48 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
The cameras follow victims from accident to recovery as they receive the type 
of immediate care that is, in many cases, lifesaving. 
</P>
<P>
Such video jaunts into the pressure and tension of real-life situations are 
becoming standard television fare, often more gripping than any script. No 
actors could adequately re-create the real scenes of doctors working to save a 
life. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard, however, for viewers not to become slightly jaded. If the real-life 
action is not on par with a Clint Eastwood movie, they head for the remote 
control. This speaks more to the nature of audiences than the quality of real 
life. But the fickleness of television audiences is part of reality, too. 
</P>
<P>
In the non-stop drama of the Trauma Center, Channel 10 has found an intense 
subject for its "Signature Series" cameras. But the producers don't do it 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Little of the pressure or sweat that a viewer expects to find in a trauma 
center comes through on the little television screen. 
</P>
<P>
Shows like "48 Hours" succeed through crisp editing and tight camera shots. 
"Trauma!" takes the audience inside the operating rooms, but it is unable to 
convey the urgency or tension of the life-or-death situation, other than 
through a relatively bland narration. 
</P>
<P>
The program does an excellent job of following individual cases, but there is 
none of the swirl of emotion that must accompany six critical head injuries 
arriving in a seven-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's rock 'n' roll," one of the doctors says. All the audience gets is light 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the program seems to consist of doctors asking patients questions. The 
cool demeanor of the Trauma Center staff is testimony to their professionalism 
and training, but it doesn't always make for great television. 
</P>
<P>
The producers attempt to build the show into something more, something 
dramatic, through artificial means, similar to the explanation point in the 
show's title. They toss in a few special effects like slow motion, and narrator 
Mark Matthews says ominous things like, if "you or someone you love" hasn't had 
need of a trauma center, you "almost certainly will." 
</P>
<P>
In good Reality Television, narration often seems superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
"Trauma!" breaks up the scenes from the Trauma Center, with segments on the 
history of trauma care and the problems of funding the trauma center system. 
The six centers servicing all of San Diego County are under constant financial 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The program succeeds in discussing the problems and obstacles facing the trauma 
centers, in delineating the definite need for them, but this reduces the 
program to distant discussions about saving "productive" people. It's an 
important message, but not enough to carry an hour-long special. 
</P>
<P>
The human aspect, the drama of doctors and nurses working 24-hour shifts, are 
the real story here. "Trauma!" only leaves the viewer wanting more.

BACKERS OF LOSING SCHOOL TAX WONDER WHAT HIT THEM

SOUTH PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stunned supporters of a proposed parcel tax to aid the city's schools were 
picking through the wreckage of their failed campaign Wednesday, trying to 
explain the "silent opposition" that defeated them at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Despite virtual across-the-board support from the city's Establishment, 
Proposition A, which would have imposed a $98-a-year parcel tax for five years, 
fell more than four percentage points short of the two-thirds majority it 
needed in Tuesday's special election. 
</P>
<P>
The final count was 2,851 for the tax and 1,728 against it, or 62.3% to 37.7%. 
</P>
<P>
At a gathering in a South Pasadena home on Election Night, School Supt. Lou 
Joseph was already trying to figure out how the district would make up for a 
budget shortfall by cutting jobs and programs. The first to go on the block, he 
said, would be eight teaching positions he was seeking to cut class sizes and 
to beef up services for students with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe the voters would let us down," said Joseph, shaking his head. 
The district has cut the school budget by $1.2 million in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure, who kept a low profile until the last week of the 
campaign, attributed the defeat to an instinctive resistance to new taxes, no 
matter what the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the time, money and effort spent," said tax opponent Victor 
Minjares, "this indicates that the people are going to vote against additional 
taxes, no matter what." He added that voters still largely support "the ethics 
of Proposition 13." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition A had expressed high hopes because of the widespread 
support it had drawn. Endorsements had come from groups as diverse as the 
teachers union, local Democratic and Republican clubs, and the South Pasadena 
Taxpayers Assn., a perennial critic of city spending policies. The campaign was 
staffed by a small army of parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But last-minute publicity about huge state surpluses and Proposition 98, a 
state school aid measure approved by voters last year, increased the perception 
that the parcel tax was unnecessary, campaign leaders acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"The surplus sure didn't help," said Jessica Katz, a mother of two 
schoolchildren, who directed the campaign for Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, proponents of the tax were stung by a flyer distributed last 
week by a group identifying itself as South Pasadenans for Integrity in 
Government. The flyer, which was folded into a local newspaper, suggested that 
the tax was unnecessary and accused the district of maintaining "a swollen 
bureaucracy of 21 administrators." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer also said parents of 100 students from outside the district who are 
permitted to attend schools here would, in effect, be exempt from the tax. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer, which did not include the name of its authors, was "inherently 
unfair," said Katz. In the first place, he said, the opposition group failed to 
register as a political committee with the county registrar-recorder, as 
required by the state Government Code. A spokeswoman for the registrar 
confirmed that there was no record of the group on a list of registered 
political committees. 
</P>
<P>
Katz added that the flyer misrepresented the district's financial situation. 
There are fewer than 16 administrators in the district, and nonresident 
students each bring in about $2,600 a year in state funding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never heard from any of these people during the campaign," said Katz. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, a big block of voters express themselves only at the polls," said 
school board member Ellen Hervey. 
</P>
<P>
But campaign leaders conceded that they may have failed to convince many of the 
city's senior citizens, who not only constitute more than a quarter of the 
population but who also vote in disproportionately high numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had it to do over again," said Katz, "I think I would have strongly 
recommended that we give senior citizens an option to apply for an exemption 
from the tax." Proposition A would have exempted only low-income or elderly 
property owners with moderate incomes. "If we had given them all an option, 
many would have chosen to pay," said Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, once-optimistic administrators and school board members face the 
future with grim determination, despite the prospect of some new state money. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to cut until the budget balances," said board member Margaret 
Ann Abdalla. "It's not going to be fun."

OFFICIAL SAYS COLLEAGUE SEXUALLY HARASSED HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic scene before a packed hearing of the Ventura City Council, an 
accounting manager for the city charged this week that she was sexually and 
physically harassed for two years by the city's budget coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Spaccia, who said she is on full disability from her city job because of 
the emotional trauma she has suffered, leveled the charge against Budget 
Coordinator Michael Solomon during a budget hearing Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
While the council and a surprised crowd of more than 120 spectators listened in 
total silence, Spaccia urged council members to vote down a pay raise for City 
Manager John A. Baker on grounds that he did not properly discipline Solomon 
for the alleged harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Spaccia, 30, later told reporters that she was the target of sexual overtures 
by Solomon for a period beginning in 1986 and ending in 1988 with an incident 
in which he allegedly grabbed her by the arms and picked her up bodily during 
an argument in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Spaccia said, she began having nightmares and consulted a 
therapist. She said that he advised her to take action "or I would be 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filed Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Spaccia said she then filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunities Commission and a grievance with the city. She said that an 
investigation resulted in a 20-day suspension without pay for Solomon -- a 
punishment she considers insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who was granted a 10% pay raise to about $94,000 a year by the council 
despite Spaccia's appeal, would not comment on the allegations, saying they 
involve potential litigation against the city. Solomon could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Spaccia said she was paid more than $50,000 annually. She said a therapist has 
told her she is sufficiently recovered to return to work, and she would like to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what my status is," she said. "My therapist says I can't return 
to work with Solomon. The city has appointed a vocational counselor to try to 
get me some other job, but $50,000-a-year jobs don't grow on trees."

PRESERVATION OFFICER ENGINEERS CLINIC PACT

<P>
In a compromise that would save the facade and some of the most cherished parts 
of the old Harriman Jones clinic on Cherry Avenue, developers and 
preservationists have agreed to a plan that would replace part of the building 
with a four-story luxury condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
The plan cleared the way for the City Council this week to designate the 
59-year-old clinic a local historical landmark, a move that gives the city a 
stronger hand in determining the building's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle over Harriman Jones has been closely watched by developers and 
preservationists because it is the first preservation controversy to erupt 
since the city's new historic preservation officer was hired in the wake of 
several stinging preservation losses. 
</P>
<P>
Although a leading preservationist involved in the negotiations said he had not 
yet abandoned all hope of saving the entire building, the plan to leave only 
part of it standing was termed a "win-win" situation by one of the developers 
who wants to erect 49 condominiums and a row of shops on the rest of the Bixby 
Park site. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said the compromise never would have been achieved without 
Preservation Officer Ruthann Lehrer, who arrived from Los Angeles in February 
to fill the new post, which was born of local officialdom's growing sensitivity 
to preservation issues. 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer, saying she was pleased with the outcome of three months of talks, 
described the design plan as "one that has distinction and that is unique and 
is not off-the-shelf architecture. It preserves important architectural 
elements of the building and the memory of the presence of the building." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Lehrer cautioned that developers should not interpret the Harriman 
Jones proposal as a signal that all they need to do is save the front of a 
building. "The development community should not feel that facade preservation 
is always going to be acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Searching for Plan 
</P>
<P>
Unable to devise a plan that would save all of the building at the corner of 
Broadway and Cherry Avenue and also make money for the developer, the Coalition 
to Preserve Historic Long Beach will support the facade retention plan, 
according to Douglas Otto, coalition chairman. Otto said in an interview later 
that he is continuing to search for a plan that would save the entire clinic 
and prove financially acceptable to the developers, Terry/Nikols Development 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the last card has been played in this game," said Otto, whose 
group even hired its own architect to prepare a development proposal. The 
problem, Lehrer said, was that any plan that satisfied the financial 
requirements of the developer and kept all of the clinic also called for too 
tall of a building on the rest of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Charles L. Terry Sr., co-owner of Terry/Nikols, which is buying the clinic, 
said his firm "quite drastically" revised its original plans, agreeing not only 
to save parts of the clinic but also to change the condominium design to 
maintain the architectural style of the facade. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone the extra mile," said Terry, who described the compromise as a 
victory for both sides which eliminates the threat of a major preservation 
fight that could greatly delay his project at substantial costs to his company. 
</P>
<P>
To smooth the way for the building's designation as an historical landmark, 
Lehrer had delayed taking the nomination to the council until a compromise was 
reached. While landmark status does not prevent an owner from razing a building 
, it does give the city the power to delay demolition for up to a year, and it 
prohibits significant remodeling without city approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approvals Required 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the council gives final approval to the landmark designation next 
week, Terry/Nikols must then obtain the approval of the local Cultural Heritage 
Commission, the Planning Commission, and the state Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to retaining the Cherry Avenue facade, the proposal calls for 
saving a 10- to 15-foot strip of the interior behind the front wall, the 
portico and entrance and the upstairs library. The wood-beamed waiting area 
known as the living room would be converted to an elevator lobby to the 
condominiums, leaving little of the original. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by one of Long Beach's most prominent physicians, Dr. Harriman Jones, 
the clinic played a leading role in the city's medical history, only recently 
closing when the Harriman Jones Medical Group consolidated its services in a 
new building on Willow Street. Thousands of mothers gave birth to their 
children in the old clinic, which also initially served as a hospital, making 
the clinic's preservation as much of an emotional issue as an architectural and 
neighborhood one. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize how sensitive an issue it would be," Terry said.

LONG BEACH PASSES $1.3-BILLION BUDGET

<P>
The City Council, following City Manager James Hankla's recommendations, this 
week passed a $1.3-billion city budget that modestly increases services along 
with a variety of city fees. 
</P>
<P>
In the only departure from Hankla's spending plan, the council went along with 
Mayor Ernie Kell's proposal to add $700,000 to the budget for sidewalk repair 
and $200,000 for anti-drug and anti-gang programs. The council also added 
another $100,000 to pay for anti-graffiti efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Kell was able to marshal the votes for the sidewalk expenditures despite 
complaints by his political opponents that the money would be better spent on 
expanding the police force. The sidewalk plan passed 6 to 3, with council 
members Thomas Clark, Jan Hall and Evan Anderson Braude voting no. Clark plans 
to run against Kell next year, and Hall ran against him last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adds Investigators 
</P>
<P>
The $1.3-billion budget, approved unanimously, provides for an additional 10 
police officers, restores library staff hours cut in previous years, expands 
the park ranger program and adds two new internal affairs investigators to the 
city manager's office to oversee internal affairs complaints in the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
A number of city fees will increase. Marina slips will cost another 4%, trash 
collection bills will rise 4.8%, zoning fees will increase by 20%, and building 
construction inspection fees will increase by varying amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials felt the city was strong enough financially to add 
services in the coming fiscal year, they pointed out that the city is 
continuing to dip into its reserve funds. The general fund, which pays for 
basic city services, will take in $7 million less in the next fiscal year than 
it will spend, creating a shortfall that must be absorbed by a reserve fund 
that has been declining since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
While there is general agreement that the Police Department is short staffed, 
Vice Mayor Wallace Edgertown said council members did not want to substantially 
add to the police force without finding new revenue sources to pay for the 
extra staff. They decided it was wiser, Edgertown said, to spend reserve funds 
on one-time costs, such as sidewalk repair.

The speed of everything around him, compared to life in his native Egypt, 
stunned Ahmed Zewail the moment he landed in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for five minutes I just had to stand there and absorb this whole new 
culture," the Caltech professor of chemical physics said of that moment 20 
years ago in a Philadelphia airport. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with one major honor following another, Zewail is receiving international 
recognition for recording the formation and breaking of molecular bonds, a

Zewail's career is on a fast track. This spring, at 43, he was named to the 
prestigious National Academy of Sciences, whose members are usually in their 
mid-50s when they are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Academy membership came right on the heels of the 1989 King Faisal 
International Prize in Science, which Zewail received in Saudi Arabia for 
"pioneering and excellent work on ultrafast laser chemistry." Zewail received 
$100,000 along with the award. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview between celebrations at Caltech, the ebullient Zewail theorized 
that his airport introduction to America was symbolic of his later success. 
</P>
<P>
"It is because of this speed, this ability to move fast and cut through 
bureaucracy, that we can achieve quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues say Zewail adds enthusiasm and excitement to painstaking work on 
projects that require years to complete. But they add that he is extremely 
cautious and insists on absolute proof before allowing any of the results from 
projects he supervises to be published. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Marcus, Caltech professor of chemistry, called Zewail "fearless, and an 
outstanding scientist." 
</P>
<P>
"He has a good eye for important problems and is willing to do everything that 
has to be done to get a solution," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
Zewail arrived at Caltech in 1976, after earning a bachelor's degree at 
Alexandria University in Egypt and graduate degrees at the University of 
Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley, where he did postdoctoral work. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, he was able to predict his Caltech research team's ability to "look at 
the moment of birth of a molecule." 
</P>
<P>
"A year later we saw it happen. It was a wonderful celebration," he said, 
waving toward empty Champagne bottles that still decorate a corner of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his scientific achievement in family terms, Zewail said: "Molecules 
A and B meet, marry and beget the species. This takes place in one millionth of 
a billionth of a second. This is a fundamental process in nature, and the world 
was looking for a way to be able to see the process. But many brilliant people 
said it couldn't be done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laser-Captured Instant 
</P>
<P>
Using a laser as if it were a camera, and recording the phenomena through the 
use of a computer, Zewail said the laser could record in millionths of a 
billionth of a second, which is called a femtosecond. 
</P>
<P>
He described a femtosecond as equal to the time it takes light to travel one 
one-hundredth of the width of a human hair. Another analogy he uses is: "A 
femtosecond is comparable to one second in 32 million years. It is like 
watching a 32-million-year movie to see one second." 
</P>
<P>
The "marrying and birth" of molecules was recorded and proved repeatedly in his 
laboratory by a team working with him. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bernstein, a UCLA professor of chemistry and a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences, was a visiting scholar at Caltech working with Zewail's 
research team when proof of the molecular action was recorded in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said that, in applying laser physics to molecular bonding, Zewail was 
successful with "a concept that had been only a curiosity. He made it a useful 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
"Once we understand how molecules are formed, we can manipulate them," Zewail 
said. "If you can manipulate molecules you can manipulate genes and matter, you 
can synthesize new material -- the implications are just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Far from completing his project, Zewail said the breakthrough "establishes what 
we have to work on for five to 10 years, as we try to understand why molecules 
love each other and hate each other. There is a lot of analogy between 
molecules and humans, but they are perhaps smarter." 
</P>
<P>
Doctoral student Marcos Dantus said Zewail "gets very excited, and that 
definitely has an impact on science. He will come to the lab or will keep 
calling, even if it's midnight, so you feel tremendous enthusiasm. And if we're 
down he'll give us a pep talk, like this is the most important thing in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
That excitement, Dantus said, stems from Zewail's "unusually strong intuition 
-- his feeling that comes from having done all the necessary research. It's an 
unusual characteristic for a scientist." 
</P>
<P>
Zewail traces his love for science to his family's encouragement and to the 
Egyptian educational system, which gives a lot of support to scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"The dream of my family was for me to be an educated person," he said, 
describing a well-rounded childhood in Alexandria with three sisters, all of 
whom have college educations. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm sort of a hero, and when I go there it's in all the newspapers," he 
said. "(Egyptians) see me as one of their people who can go to the United 
States and do something important and they are very, very proud." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived to study at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969, he said, "I 
immediately saw the difference between Egypt and us. I was so impressed by the 
way things go so fast, without so much bureaucracy. There is this element of 
the importance of time." 
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech when he received the King Faisal prize, Zewail 
credited his success to his family, to Egypt for his excellent early education, 
to Caltech for creating a good scientific atmosphere, and to colleagues and the 
78 graduate and postdoctoral students who have worked with him during his 13 
years at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Bit of Luck 
</P>
<P>
"But I tell you, it is really more luck," he said in the interview. "There is a 
lot to being in the right place at the right time with the right people. So I 
was in the right place and did the work that people were excited about." 
</P>
<P>
A fan of almost everything American, he is nevertheless critical of the lack of 
media attention that is given to science. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in one of the most advanced nations on earth in science and 
technology, and we don't have one hour a week devoted to science on national 
network television," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major problems we have is that young people are not super-excited 
about going into science," he said. "Instead, what we see is that, if you are 
smart, you can go to the stock market and very quickly become a millionaire and 
retire. The impact of this on the nation is very obvious." 
</P>
<P>
He is the father of daughters Maha, 16, and Amani, 10, who live in Pasadena 
and, he said, dream of becoming scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"And the problem I have right now is time," Zewail said. "There are tremendous 
demands on my time. I concentrate all my efforts on time."

HONEY POSES A STICKY PROBLEM FOR CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Ray Akin, pastor of the East Whittier Christian Church, struggled for 
an appropriate biblical lesson to put the church's newest dilemma in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for last Sunday's sermon, Akin looked up various references to honey 
in the book of Psalms and the poetic collection of verses called the Song of 
Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
He even considered a gory tale in the Old Testament book of Judges that tells 
how Samson tore a lion apart with his bare hands and pulled a honeycomb from 
the belly of the vanquished beast. 
</P>
<P>
Akin made his diligent search after honey began dripping from the apex of the 
sanctuary's 75-foot ceiling two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Puddle on Carpet 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders preparing for Sunday services found a large puddle of the gooey 
substance on the platform in front of the church altar. They scrambled to 
spread large plastic drop cloths to catch the dripping honey before the 
congregation gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the pastor decided to discuss the honey-dripping dilemma in his 
weekly Sunday message to the congregation's children. 
</P>
<P>
"We are blessed with an infestation of bees," Akin told the handful of boys and 
girls who were called to sit on the carpeted altar area, away from the dripping 
honey, during Sunday's service. "We are blessed with the fruits of their (the 
bees') labor." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 23-year-old church are abuzz over the implications of the honey, 
which they say appears to be dripping from an overloaded honeycomb hidden in a 
tiny space between the sweeping ceiling and the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"This is truly manna from heaven," church day-care worker Peggy Wasmuth quipped 
as she passed out peaches to a group of preschoolers in the church yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sweet Gift From God' 
</P>
<P>
Violet Holguin, another day-care worker, said the honey "is a sweet gift from 
God." Then she ran to the church kitchen, grabbed a cooking pot and placed it 
on the platform to collect some of the honey. 
</P>
<P>
Even Akin has joined in the lighthearted remarks about the honey that seems to 
be dripping from nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We could offer milk before or after worship," Akin suggested in a whimsical 
message he wrote for the church's weekly newsletter, "and call ourselves the 
church flowing with milk and honey." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the good-natured comments about the steady flow of honey, it has begun 
to cause problems, Akin said. 
</P>
<P>
Church members have been forced to spread plastic sheets across the altar 
platform to stem the spreading puddle on the carpet. And they have had to forgo 
many of the activities that center around the church altar, such as singing and 
preparing Communion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Need New Roof 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders plan to launch a fund-raising campaign to finance a re-roofing 
project. "We've been told that there could be almost 500 pounds of honey up 
there," one deacon said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Akin stressed the seriousness of the situation before the church ushers passed 
the offering plates around the small congregation. He cited a verse in the book 
of Revelation that says: 
</P>
<P>
"So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll; and he said 
to me, 'Take it and eat; it will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey 
in your mouth.' " 
</P>
<P>
The honey "may be sweet to our mouths," Akin told the congregation, "but in the 
final analysis, I suspect that what we will have to do to combat the problem 
will turn sour in our stomachs. Please be generous." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Brobston, a deacon and founding member of the church, said that the 
dripping honey is the latest in a series of problems since a swarm of bees 
began building hives around the reinforced footing of a cross that sits atop 
the red, high-peaked roof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exterminators Called In 
</P>
<P>
Despite extermination efforts over the years, the bees remained. Later, he 
said, the swarms of honey bees found their way inside the roof -- most likely 
to escape the work of the exterminators -- and began building honeycombs in the 
10-inch space between the acoustical ceiling and the underpinnings of the heavy 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to sweep (dead bees) up from the floor of the sanctuary," Brobston 
said. Once, he said, the church organist was stung on the finger by an angry 
honey bee. "Sometimes they swarm in by the hundreds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brobston, a retired home builder, said that church leaders have been told by 
several exterminators a segment of the ceiling or the roof must be removed to 
get to the honeycomb. "We've tried everything simpler than that, but (the bees) 
keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate solution, Brobston said, could cost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an expense we could afford to have over our heads right now," Akin 
said. "We'll have to start up fund-raising efforts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lesson for Children 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, some church members remain upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful," said Rebecca Serrini, a teacher at the church's day-care 
center. She said that three weeks ago, a fellow teacher coincidentally taught a 
group of children sitting in the sanctuary about the miracle of bees and how 
they collect nectar from flowers and turn it into honey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny that we had the miracle happening right over our heads and we 
didn't know it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like holy honey," added day-care center Director Stella Morago.

PROPOSED LAW HAS BUSINESS THINKING ABOUT SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM FULTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clarence Walthall probably won't get the notice in the mail from the county 
until early next year, but he's already thinking about it. Walthall is the 
operations manager of Petoseed Co. in Saticoy -- "in charge of everything that 
doesn't have to do with seeds," as he puts it -- and the notice he's expecting 
will require his company to change the commuting habits of the 160 people who 
work there. 
</P>
<P>
Walthall has a few ideas already: preferred parking places for car-poolers, 
flexible hours for some employees, awards for those departments with the most 
ride-sharing. But it's likely to be an uphill battle. "Flex-time" isn't an 
option for most of his workers. And rush-hour traffic, while congested, isn't 
bad enough to encourage most people to share a car or throw themselves on the 
mercy of notoriously circuitous bus routes. In the end, he says, "I'm just 
going to have to call them in here group by group and sell it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Most other big employers in Ventura County will be going through the same 
frustrating routine soon. Next week, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
will consider an air-pollution control rule that would force companies with 50 
or more employees to draw up so-called "trip-reduction" plans, designed to cut 
the number of commuter trips in cars and trucks. The measure is expected to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan succeeds in Ventura County, it will be a first. No other locality 
has tried to cut air pollution with such measures, although a few have 
succeeded in thinning peak-hour traffic. And the local business community is 
less than enthusiastic about a rule that could dramatically affect work 
schedules and business hours. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is similar to a requirement recently imposed on the four-county Los 
Angeles region by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Spokesman 
William Kelly said the South Coast agency has rejected about 40% of the 
companies' ride-sharing plans so far. "A lot of the companies seem to want to 
do the minimal amount required -- as little as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Ventura County ride-sharing rule meets its goal, it will reduce air 
pollution in the county by only about one-half of one percent. But its symbolic 
value is considerable. It would be the first regulation in Ventura County aimed 
at reducing smog from "mobile" sources -- such as cars and trucks -- rather 
than "stationary" sources such as factories and oil fields. As such, the rule 
is probably an indication of things to come, as county and federal officials 
struggle over the next few years to attain federal clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ventura County has suffered only two smog alerts in the last six years, 
its pollution problems are among the worst in the nation. In fact, the Air 
Pollution Control District has never set forth a strategy to meet federal air 
quality standards -- a violation of federal law which led a local environmental 
group, Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, to file suit in an effort to force 
tougher smog-fighting measures. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a settlement last February, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has until June, 1991, to prepare a clean air strategy for Ventura 
County. County air pollution officials are working with the EPA on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Orders Feared 
</P>
<P>
The ride-sharing rule is one step in that direction. "We are trying to avoid a 
situation where some federal judge says: 'Employees in Ventura County can drive 
to work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only,' " said County Supervisor Susan 
Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
The county doesn't intend to force people out of their cars, at least not 
directly. Rather, it may require large employers to draw up plans to encourage 
their employees to share rides or commute during off-peak hours -- 
specifically, before 6 a.m. and after 10 a.m. Those hours are considered 
critical because pollutants emitted from vehicles during morning hours "bake" 
in the air on hot, still days to create afternoon smog. 
</P>
<P>
Although company officials could be fined or even jailed if they refuse to draw 
up the trip-reduction plans, they cannot be penalized if their employees do not 
reduce their trips. For the most part, the county will take the word of 
companies that the plans are being followed, although it will require a 
progress report each year. 
</P>
<P>
Most organized business leaders in the county, including the Ventura County 
Economic Development Assn., support the rule. But individual firms vary in 
their commitment to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Plans Exist 
</P>
<P>
Some have old ride-sharing plans dating to the energy crisis of the late 1970s. 
GTE instituted an extensive, employer-subsidized van pool and private bus 
system when it moved its corporate headquarters from Santa Monica to Thousand 
Oaks four years ago. "We plan to do this at least until construction of the 
Ventura Freeway is done and possibly thereafter," said spokesman Larry Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Other employers fear that they will not be able to induce their workers to 
change their habits, especially if they live close to work. "Car-pooling may 
not make sense here," said Connie Taylor, public information officer at the 
Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center. Many of the base's 10,000 
employees live "almost on the perimeter of the base," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation experts acknowledge that it will be difficult for companies to 
meet the goals required of them, especially in a suburban county where 
dependence on the automobile is high and traffic congestion is not as great as 
it is in a large city such as Los Angeles. "There is no perceived need; 
therefore the effort is going to be so much more difficult," said Tricia Price, 
head of the Ventura office of Commuter Transportation Services, a nonprofit 
organization that runs the Commuter Computer and assists companies with 
ride-sharing plans. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful ride-sharing programs typically involve employees who 
travel long distances to work. For example, more than 10% of the 2,500 
employees who work at GTE's corporate headquarters use the company's private 
buses and van pools -- many from such distant locations as Long Beach and San 
Bernardino. These employees pay, on average, about $60 to $70 per month for the 
van service, but such fees only cover about a third of the cost. GTE picks up 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Help Seen 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, flexible work hours may be not be much help in achieving the 
goals because of the expansive definition of morning rush hours -- 6 a.m. to 10 
a.m. For example, the Naval Ship Weapons System Engineering Station at Port 
Hueneme, which has a mostly white-collar work force of 2,000 people, permits 
flexible work hours. But, said spokesman Russ Pyle, "we have to be at work by 
9." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Executive 
Officer Richard Baldwin pointed out, a four-day, 10-hour-per-day work schedule 
might be an effective tool to cut morning rush hour trips. Such schedules are 
still relatively rare, although in Los Angeles, virtually all 900 employees of 
the Air Quality Management District work a "4/10" schedule. Pyle said the Port 
Hueneme engineering operation has a four-day work week as an option, but no 
survey has been conducted to determine how many employees use it. 
</P>
<P>
Cities elsewhere have experienced some success at reducing traffic through 
car-pooling plans. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Northern California city of Pleasanton has aggressively 
required developers to reduce employees' commuting trips. In commending 
Pleasanton's efforts, urban planners around the U.S. have pointed to the city's 
dramatic results: 54% of all commuters either ride mass transit or drive during 
off-peak hours. But because the Pleasanton ordinance is designed to reduce 
traffic congestion, not smog, the definition of "peak" hours is narrow: 
7:30-8:30 a.m. and 4:30-5:30 p.m. Only 15% of the employees walk, bicycle, or 
ride a bus to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Pride Helps 
</P>
<P>
Transportation experts say that corporate pride plays a role in implementing 
ride-sharing plans. Pasadena consultant Peter Valk, who has assisted L.A.-area 
companies in complying with the ride-sharing rule there, acknowledged that his 
clients may be reluctant at first to push hard. "But once they face the reality 
of having to make the investment, they figure they might as well make it pay 
off, both symbolically and in a real dollar way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Pleasanton, city transportation director Gail Gilpin said the bad publicity 
associated with not meeting the ride-sharing targets often motivates businesses 
to try harder. "All the information that comes through my office is on the 
public record, so if they don't reach their goal, it gets into the press real 
easily," she said. "That disincentive is probably greater than any fine." 
</P>
<P>
If the rule is approved, the Air Pollution Control District will begin working 
with companies of 100 employees or more next year. Companies of 75 to 99 
employees will be affected in 1991, and companies with 50 to 74 employees will 
be affected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The county has about 580 companies with 50 or more employees; together, these 
companies employ about half the county's 250,000-member work force. The rule 
will apply only to employees who must report to the same location at least 10 
days per month. Most field workers will be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Under the trip-reduction rule, each company's "average vehicle ridership" must 
rise from an average of about 1.1 persons per vehicle today to 1.35 initially 
and 1.5 by 1997.

HUNTINGTON PARK CALLS SPECIAL VOTE ON 7% UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city, prevented from taxing utility users by a court decision, will take 
its case to the voters in an effort to raise $2.74 million a year to hire 15 
more police officers and retain services scheduled to be cut from next year's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday scheduled a special election Sept. 12 on the 
proposed 7% tax that would be applied to electricity, natural gas, water and 
telephone bills. If approved, the tax would take effect by December, 
Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the people now," said Mayor William P. Cunningham. "If the voters 
don't pass it, then I would say city services will be cut. I don't see any way 
to get around it." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members thought they had solved Huntington Park's budget problems 
last month when they approved the 7% utility tax, to take effect on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symphony Subsidy Cut 
</P>
<P>
They took the action after reviewing a preliminary budget for 1989-90 that 
included no raises for city employees and drew from reserves. The budget 
outlined more than $200,000 in cuts for tree trimming and other city 
maintenance. It also reduced spending for items such as Christmas decorations 
on Pacific Boulevard and a subsidy for the Huntington Park Symphony Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council initially approved the tax based on an appellate court 
decision in a lawsuit spawned by Proposition 62. Approved by California voters 
in 1986, Proposition 62 says a city may not impose a tax to fund general 
governmental services without the approval of local voters. 
</P>
<P>
But on March 7, a state appellate court decided in a Sonoma County case that 
several provisions in the measure were unconstitutional. The decision appeared 
to clear the way for cities to impose utility and other taxes without a vote of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park City Council moved quickly and approved the utility tax on 
May 15. But the council was rebuffed three days later when the California 
Supreme Court ordered that the appellate court decision not be published. The 
action prevents the ruling from being used as precedent, and Huntington Park 
would be vulnerable to a lawsuit if it were to impose the tax without that 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Steven N. Skolnik has asked the state Supreme Court to reconsider 
its decision. But city officials, who are not optimistic that will happen, 
decided to press ahead with the special election. 
</P>
<P>
If the tax wins approval, the City Council said it intends to use about $1 
million of the revenue it will produce annually to pay for 22 Police Department 
positions, including two sergeants, 13 officers and seven support positions. 
</P>
<P>
The tax also is expected to provide money for employee raises, tree trimming, 
maintenance and other services. City employees received a 4.2% raise this year 
at a cost to the city of about $300,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffers, the city administrator, said the city is in a financial bind because 
of Proposition 13, the 1978 tax-cutting measure, and the recent reduction or 
elimination of state and federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Stays Same 
</P>
<P>
Revenues entering the city's general fund, which pays for most city services 
including law enforcement and fire protection, have not increased. 
</P>
<P>
The city's general fund revenues in 1989-90 will be about $9.7 million without 
the utility tax, about the same as 1987-88 revenues, according to the 
preliminary budget. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary budget projects overall revenues and expenditures of $27.7 
million. That includes money to pay for public transportation, the city 
retirement plan and other items in addition to daily operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency also has contributed to the city's 
financial pinch. The city has been forced to lend the Redevelopment Agency 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years to help it meet its bond debt. 
Project delays in the mid-1980s prevented the Redevelopment Agency from 
generating expected revenues to make its bond payments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Public testimony was equally divided during a hearing before the council 
approved the utility tax on May 15. Some residents said they would gladly pay 
the tax if it meant improved police services. Others said it would be a 
financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, only one person testified. Resident Emilia Kitchen referred to 
a recently released study that indicated Huntington Park was the 
seventh-poorest community in the country with a per-capita income of $6,298. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the majority of the people will be able to afford the tax," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The special election will cost the city $15,000.

THEY HEAR NO CHEERS, BUT LOVE TO PLAY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Rene Diaz, 11, told his big brother that he and his friends wanted to play 
baseball, Fernando Diaz knew they would need some special help. 
</P>
<P>
Rene and his friends are deaf, and while they took immediately to the game, 
they were afraid to join the teams they saw playing in a neighborhood park. 
They knew they couldn't talk to the other children, and the coaches couldn't 
talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
But Fernando Diaz could. So he decided to coach the children himself. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rene and his friends make up most of a team in the park league at Eagle 
Rock's Yosemite Recreation Center. Next month their second season will begin. 
Rene says the team is the best thing that has ever happened to him. Fernando 
says his little brother and friends are getting the chance to grow up just like 
other children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Having a Ball' 
</P>
<P>
"They're having a ball," said Diaz, 19, tossing a bat to his brother with one 
hand and speaking to him with the other at a recent practice. "On another team, 
he'd be lost. He'd be on his own. He'd be a blackball in the bunch. Here he can 
understand what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Diaz's team looks like any other group of gregarious youngsters 
learning to play ball. But they don't sound the same. They play the game almost 
silently, the stillness punctuated occasionally by a laugh or a shout. Their 
hands fly through the air, gesturing precisely and rapidly in a language that 
matches the lyrical motions of the baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
The team is made up of nine deaf children and four who can hear. They play from 
July through September against 20 other teams in the league sponsored by the 
Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. Al Varnas, recreation director 
at Yosemite Park, said that while there are no rules prohibiting deaf children 
from playing on any of the league's teams, he doubts many of the league's 
volunteer coaches would be able to communicate with a deaf child. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they need a coach or someone who would be taking care of them who 
is knowledgeable in the sign language art and can communicate with them," 
Varnas said. "Someone has to explain certain aspects of the game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equal Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Thompson, senior recreation director at the park, said the children on 
other teams treat the deaf children the same as they would anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very well accepted after the initial shock," Thompson said. "The 
child says, 'Oh goodness, he doesn't hear.' Five or 10 minutes later they're 
working together just beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
The children on the team who are not deaf say they joined for the same reason 
many children join a particular group -- because their friends had joined. Most 
attend Multnomah Elementary School in El Sereno, which has a special program 
for deaf youngsters as well as a regular elementary school program. Others, 
such as Eddie Ortiz, 12, live next door to one of the deaf children on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I met him, I wanted to talk to him." Ortiz said of meeting his 
friend, Joseph. "He taught me . . . and I'd practice. I learned how to sign." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent practice, some children batted against a fence. Others were on the 
field playing catch. Fernando and two friends who help were moving quickly from 
one group to another. Fernando explained the rudiments of the game to his 
charges in fluent sign language. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball team is not the first idea Fernando has had to help his brother. A 
competitive runner, he began bringing Rene and his friends to the track last 
year and teaching them to work out. Soon he began entering them in races. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to introduce these kids to different sports," Diaz said. "I just love 
working with kids. I love that feeling you get when they surpass their limits 
or just do great or they say 'thank you.' I communicate with them perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said his whole family uses sign language and his parents have taught them 
to treat their brother like any other child. 
</P>
<P>
"When they grow up they're not gonna get special favors from anybody else," 
Diaz said. "This gives them more confidence. Without confidence, these kids 
wouldn't be doing as well as they should be." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz is a student at Glendale Community College who will be starting at UC 
Berkeley in January. He says he wants to go to law school, and he is no 
stranger to persuasion. He has drummed up money to buy equipment for the team 
and for the $30-per-child registration fee required to join the league. At a 
car wash on Memorial Day weekend, he and the team raised $500. And he has 
persuaded Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre to come to another team 
car wash on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take some kids with me to the local churches beforehand," Diaz 
says with a wink. "We'll see how good a mood people are in after Mass. You 
know, give them a little pitch outside. Put them on the spot."

CARNAVAL STREET FESTIVAL MAKES PROFIT OF $11,740 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proclaiming it a resounding success, the sponsors of Carnaval II say that the 
Caribbean-flavored festival in downtown Long Beach attracted up to 60,000 
revelers and wound up with a net profit of $11,740. 
</P>
<P>
The event marked a major improvement from its debut last year when Carnaval 
attracted large crowds but racked up a $67,352 deficit because of poor liquor 
sales and unplanned expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gurzi, president of the Downtown Long Beach Associates business group that 
staged the event, said the parade and music festival would have drawn even more 
had it not occurred on Saturday during the three-day Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Al Williams, owner of the Birdland West jazz club and Carnaval II chairman, 
said the event brought together a wide range of society, "the rich people and 
the poor people," to watch costumed parade participants, sample ethnic foods 
and listen to a variety of bands. 
</P>
<P>
He said there were 10 arrests, all for drunk and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this year's financial success was due to the sale of wristbands for $2 
each for admission to all music venues, increased beer sales and tougher 
financial controls, financial officer Bob Sabol said.

CHILDREN'S ART FEATURED IN HISTORIC HOMES TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A show of children's art and tours of historic homes will be featured Sunday as 
the Willmore City Heritage Assn. presents its annual house tour. 
</P>
<P>
This year's tour will feature houses built between 1890 and 1925 in various 
stages of restoration, including some that have been divided into apartments. 
Pupils from Edison Elementary School will display their paintings based on 
impressions from walking tours of the historic district, according to the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
The Willmore district is north of downtown Long Beach and is the oldest area of 
the city. It is dotted with turn-of-the-century Victorian houses, many of which 
are being restored to previous splendor by residents. 
</P>
<P>
The tour and art show are being organized in Drake Park, 951 Maine Ave., from 
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tickets are available for $8 in advance from the association 
office at 1213 Cedar Ave. or for $10 at the event.

PASADENA PAROLE OFFICE FLAP HAS 'BITTER IRONY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The objection by city fathers to locating a parole office in east Pasadena has 
a bitter irony to it (Times, June 1). 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the same Board of Directors steamrollered through a facility on 
South Raymond in the commercial west side that would feed 150 people, but has 
space for only 40 of them to sleep. Where will the other 100-plus sleep between 
dinner and breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
Those who live on the west side of town predicted that this would cause 
problems, and officials from the Police Department testified that crime would 
increase. Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
It is only fitting that the board and the people it represents may be getting a 
taste of their own medicine.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING CONTROLS ENACTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members this week finally exercised their long-awaited authority 
to control multifamily housing, but it may have come too late to do any good. 
</P>
<P>
The council enacted a 45-day urgency ordinance requiring council review of all 
apartment or condominium projects. During the recent incorporation drive, 
cityhood proponents cited the proliferation of multifamily housing in 
once-rural Diamond Bar as proof of the need for local control. Voters approved 
cityhood March 7, and the city was incorporated April 18. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Diamond Bar officials have the power, county planners have 
informed them that only one parcel zoned for multifamily housing hasn't already 
been built upon. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse is already out of the barn," said Mayor Pro Tem Paul Horcher. 
However, he added, the ordinance may be useful when the city annexes vacant 
land to the south and west. "Really, it will just give the council a little 
look-see at a project. It is not so Draconian as a moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
The council will continue extending the ordinance until it enacts a permanent 
measure for regulating multifamily housing.

2 TAX INCREASES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors will decide Tuesday whether to enact two 
proposed tax increases to help fund the city's $108-million budget for the 
fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals would raise the utility tax for residential customers to the same 
levels paid by commercial users and would impose a tax on interstate and 
international telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the utility tax would raise the average residential customer's 
bill by $1.57 a month. City officials said such a bill would still be $4 below 
that of a comparable customer in neighboring cities because of Pasadena's low 
rate for electricity. The tax increase would generate $750,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed telephone tax would extend a levy that already applies to calls 
made within California. It would amount to 7.86% of the cost of the calls and 
would generate about $1 million a year.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIAL DISPUTES FIRE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Mark Lewis has concluded that "it would not be fiscally prudent" 
for Monterey Park to contract with Los Angeles County for fire protection and 
rescue services. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who reviewed a proposal made by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, 
maintains that the city would lose local control and would pay more for 
firefighting. An analysis by county fire officials said Monterey Park might 
save almost $600,000 each year by consolidating its fire department with the 
county. But Lewis said his assessment shows the city might have to spend an 
additional $457,757 each year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Lewis' claim that the proposal would be more costly, officials of the 
Monterey Park Firefighters Assn. say the city would benefit by contracting with 
the county. Association spokesman Paul M. McCrummen, a Monterey Park Fire 
Department captain, said the analysis by Lewis "has somewhat overstated the 
figures or in other cases used totally meaningless" numbers. 
</P>
<P>
McCrummen said the 48-member union, currently engaged in contract negotiations 
with the city, wants Monterey Park officials to continue working with the 
county on the proposed consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, McCrummen said, would benefit by having improved salary and 
benefits and increased opportunities, if the firefighters worked for the 
county. In addition, he said, the city residents would gain by having the 
improved fire protection that the county department can provide.

SCHOOLS PROPOSE ENROLLMENT TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNELL ALEXANDER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale school officials have proposed forming a task force to investigate the 
continued rapid growth in the district's student population. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Board of Education Tuesday, Assistant Supt. David Kanthak, 
who is expected to head the task force, suggested seeking "acceptable 
alternatives" to deal with projected enrollment increases. 
</P>
<P>
Among the alternatives to be studied are a year-round class schedule, 
enrollment caps and enhanced programs. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, 1986, enrollment has increased from 19,779 to 22,641, or 14.5%, 
according to a district report. A city housing report released last month 
predicted that 2,696 students will enter the already crowded system in the next 
five years, an increase of 11.9%. District Supt. Robert Sanchis proposed the 
Futures' Task Force at Tuesday night's Board of Education meeting. The board is 
expected to formally adopt the proposal next month. 
</P>
<P>
"In schools where existing alternatives -- such as consolidation and 
construction -- have all been exhausted and there is continued enrollment, then 
yes, year-round is a strong possibility," Sanchis said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wide Support' 
</P>
<P>
He added that "there appears to be wide support for year-round at the state 
level" and that financial incentives have been offered to schools that 
participate in such programs. 
</P>
<P>
Task force members will be selected after the program is formally approved, 
Kanthak said. The board is scheduled to consider the task force at its first 
meeting in July, and the group is expected to begin operating Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The district has consolidated programs and classrooms, created temporary 
classrooms, built new facilities and changed student attendance boundaries to 
deal with crowding. "Just about anything more than what we're doing now would 
have to be considered drastic," Kanthak said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board voted in February to shift ninth-grade classes from two junior 
high schools to Hoover High School by September, 1991. The district will spend 
$4 million to build additional classrooms, but the switch will significantly 
ease crowding at the two junior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Vic Pallos said district administrators have shown more 
interest in changing current procedures -- the Hoover shift is an example -- 
than in going to a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be an option that the committee would want to look into," Pallos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, to be made up of parents, teachers, administrators and 
community leaders, will list possible alternatives, their advantages and 
disadvantages and projected costs. The task force is scheduled to submit its 
findings to the board in February.

OXNARD APPROVES $4.5-MILLION PLAN FOR LA COLONIA AREA IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council approved a plan this week to spend $4.5 million for 
street repairs, park improvements, low-interest loans and graffiti removal in 
the La Colonia neighborhood, the city's barrio. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which culminates three months of meetings between city officials and 
La Colonia residents, also calls for increasing code enforcement, street 
sweeping and police activities in the blighted neighborhood. The area of about 
one square mile has an estimated 20,000 residents, most of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been sitting around for a long time doing nothing," Councilwoman Dorothy 
S. Maron said at Tuesday's council meeting. "This could make all the difference 
of cleaning up and fixing up a neighborhood that really needs help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bridge Gap 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez said he hoped that the plan could bridge the gap 
between the "new Oxnard and an older part of the city" that, he said, has 
escaped the some of the benefits of recent development. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the neighborhood, which also includes the Rose Park tract, reacted 
enthusiastically to the council's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 23 years I've been living in the Colonia, I haven't seen this level of 
interest," Jose B. Gonzalez, a 44-year-old mechanic, told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited plan comes nearly six months after residents complained in a 
sharply worded letter submitted to the council about conditions in the 
neighborhood, where many of the houses show visible signs of decay. It also 
follows several meetings between city officials and neighborhood leaders, and a 
meeting last month attended by about 100 Colonia residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resident Complaints 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, residents complained about the neighborhood's heavily rutted 
streets, abundant and rowdy bars, and numerous city code violations, which 
include raising barnyard animals within city limits, abandoning cars on city 
streets and dumping trash on the many vacant lots in older sections. 
</P>
<P>
In meetings with city officials since then, neighborhood leaders have 
complained that the city's Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program, which provides 
low-interest loans to low-income renters and homeowners, is still out of the 
reach of most of Colonia residents. The 1980 census found the average family 
income to be half that of the city as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
While residents have expressed general satisfaction with the Oxnard Police 
Department in the neighborhood where the crime rate has dropped in recent 
years, they complained at the May 17 community meeting about a lack of 
Spanish-speaking police dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who acknowledge that some calls from Spanish-speakers are 
routed to a translation service in Hayward, said they plan to employ more 
Spanish-speaking dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improve Properties 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to spur homeowners to improve their properties, the Housing 
Authority will lower eligibility requirements for its 6% loan program and match 
loans up to $12,500 with grants at a cost of about $80,000 in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements to the neighborhood's streets account for the bulk of improvements 
at a cost of $3.2 million over four years. Many have not been resurfaced since 
La Colonia was established about 40 years ago as home to farm workers. Nearly 
half of the money will be used to widen 3rd Street on the eastern border of the 
neighborhood, which extends from Rice Avenue to Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Another large expense comes in the form of matching funds for a public 
gymnasium, for which the city has already received $450,000 in state funding. 
The city will spend an additional $650,000 to build the 8,800-square-foot 
facility. The city will also spend nearly $80,000 to improve lighting in Del 
Sol Park, the expansive park that lies between the Colonia and Rose Park 
tracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Cost 
</P>
<P>
Many of the steps outlined in the plan, however, will cost the city little if 
anything. They include stepping up notification of street-sweeping days so that 
residents can move their cars and enforcing visible violations of city codes 
instead of waiting for them to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also plan to launch new efforts to start a Neighborhood Watch. 
They said such measures in the past have been met with a mixture of apathy and 
suspicion by the residents, some of whom fear authorities because they are in 
this country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in the city's zoning laws would phase out many businesses selling 
liquor when they change hands. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also expressed the hope that the recent hiring of a former 
division manager with the United Farm Workers union as the city's senior 
community relations specialist will encourage participation of Colonia 
residents in the face lift. 
</P>
<P>
"You can appropriate all the money you want," said Karl Lawson, the newly hired 
specialist. "But we really need citizen involvement."

CHERRY CANYON SITE TO REMAIN OPEN SPACE; 
</P>
<P>
LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE TO BUY 37 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of La Canada Flintridge reached an agreement this week with a group of 
New Jersey developers to purchase 37 acres of open space that the city has 
fought for two years to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Donald H. Otterman said the developers, Flintridge Estates 
Partnership, have agreed to accept $1.75 million for a portion of their 
property at the end of Sugarloaf Drive in Cherry Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The city earlier purchased two other parcels in Cherry Canyon totaling more 
than 80 acres, Otterman said. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon is a rustic area in the San Rafael Hills on the border of Glendale 
that is popular with hikers and horseback riders. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase includes an agreement by the city granting developers an option to 
build nine homes on the remaining 10 acres of land that they are retaining. Any 
development would still require a public hearing and city approval, Otterman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers had originally proposed building 29 homes on the 47-acre site, but 
scaled down their plans to 22 homes in the wake of widespread community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Otterman said the city's hillside development ordinance would have permitted 
only 15 lots on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase is contingent upon the city receiving a $1-million state grant 
from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which is expected to approve the 
funds next month, Otterman said. The earlier land purchases were also partially 
funded by the state.

<P>
TIRED OLD DIRT RACEWAY ENJOYS A RESURGENCE AS IT FACES ITS DEMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The roar from stock cars careening around the quarter mile at Ascot Raceway did 
little for Mike Kirby's headache. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, a Long Beach resident, has been one of the hottest newcomers on the 
California Racing Assn. sprint-car circuit the past year and a half. He has 
also shown a propensity for racing pro stocks, bomber ovals and figure-8s in a 
career that is nearly a decade old. But on a recent Sunday evening, as he sat 
on a bale of straw in the windy infield at the Gardena track, he was not sure 
he wanted to race anything again except figure-8s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to race today. No way," he said about that night's stock car 
card. He was still reeling from the previous night, when problems with his 
sprint car forced him out of the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kirby, who grew up in nearby Carson, wanted it known that he is capable 
of driving just about anything, and he changed his tune about driving that 
night several times. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to drive (stocks) I will," he asserted. "I can race those things if 
I have to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Home Boys 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, 26, is a versatile driver, but he is just one of Ascot's promising young 
home boys. The group, which includes P. J. Jones of Rolling Hills Estates (full 
midgets), Frank Pedregon of Gardena and Sean Birmingham of Torrance 
(three-quarter midgets), and Chris Laney of Gardena (stocks, bomber ovals and 
figure-8s), is part of the reason the tired, old Gardena track is experiencing 
a revitalization less than 18 months from its final event. The land it sits on, 
roughly a triangular lot where the Harbor, San Diego and Artesia freeways meet, 
is slated for development once the lease with the raceway's owner, Agajanian 
Enterprises, expires in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the number of competitors at the track has increased over the past 
two years after about a decade of decline, according to Executive Vice 
President Ben Foote. About 117 cars of various types run there on any given 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the sprints alone, it was not uncommon 10 years ago to have at least 50 
cars running," Foote said. "In the mid-'80s we had 30 to 32 cars. Now on most 
nights we have 40 to 45, about the most of any association in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Foote attributes the rise in new, young drivers to a variety of factors. In the 
midget class, he said, the allure of racing under the national banner of the 
United States Auto Club is important to younger drivers. USAC became involved 
with Ascot a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"For the young guys, I think there is enthusiasm for running with a national 
organization," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racing for Fun of It 
</P>
<P>
Foote also said that the type of events offered at Ascot, like Enduro racing, 
attract a lot of drivers who just want to race for fun and then later take up 
the sport seriously. Laney began his career in Enduro, which features street 
cars modified only with a roll bar for the driver's protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think racing for fun appeals to the younger guys," Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot's demise is not news around the track, but it certainly does not set well 
with the youth invasion. "We just want to race," Pedregon said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Kirby, he has had good reason not to run pro stocks recently. A fiery 
crash May 20 took the life of fellow sprint-car racer Jeff Bagley, the 1988 
Rookie of the Year. In addition, Kirby's misfortune in the main event later 
that same night caused speculation that his sprint sponsor was considering 
canceling the remainder of the season if problems with the car were not 
corrected quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby has had his best days at sprint tracks other than Ascot and track 
officials say he would have little trouble hooking up with another racing team. 
Kirby ran second at Hanford, in the San Joaquin Valley, and set a track speed 
record in Tucson over the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A slow starter, Kirby is the oldest of the younger drivers. He did not qualify 
for a sprint main until his ninth time out last season. But since then he has 
recorded some impressive finishes, including third in a major national event 
two weeks ago in Knoxville, Tenn. He won Ascot's novice figure-8 title in 1981 
and the overall figure-8 crown in 1987. He was Most Improved Driver last year 
in quarter-mile sprint-car racing. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 20, is among the youngest successful drivers at the track. He began his 
career in go-carts and won more than a third of all his races. He began racing 
midget cars late in 1986 but was still voted USAC Rookie of the Year. In 1987 
he finished fifth in overall points in USAC midgets. He is the eldest son of 
1963 Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Pedregon, 25, spent most of his youth in the pits for his father, Frank, a 
top-fuel drag racer at famed Lions Drag Strip in Wilmington. In 1980 he raced 
diesel trucks, then switched to dirt carts in 1983. A year later he won the 
Grand National title on pavement. He set a record of eight consecutive main 
event victories in 1986, then moved up to three-quarter midgets. He has been 
seen on ESPN TV's recently concluded Thunder Series from Ascot, and on May 4 
finished third in the full midget main. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trained as a Mechanic 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham, 21, was the USAC three-quarter Rookie of the Year in 1988 after 
five top-10 finishes. An auto mechanic by trade, he began racing motocross when 
he was 6. In his late teens he was on the pit crew for the late driver Roger 
Newell. Newell was involved in a fatal accident at Ascot and that convinced 
Birmingham to start out in the three-quarters. He says he plans to return to 
sprint cars in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Laney, 20, is perhaps the hottest driver of the youth movement right now, 
despite opening the year with three blown engines in his first three events. A 
first-place finish April 30 in the pro stocks "hiked his chances for Rookie of 
the Year honors," according to the Winston Racing Series News. 
</P>
<P>
Laney is running about even in points with another talented racer, Tony Zaffino 
of Carson. Zaffino was last year's Rookie of the Year. Laney's efforts are a 
family affair. Brother Paul owns the race car, his fiancee, Karla Kirby (Mike 
Kirby's sister), helped pay for the motor and brothers Mark and Brett serve as 
his pit crew. "All the money I've got is in this car," Laney said. On the night 
Kirby chose not to race, Laney finished fourth in the pro stocks, fifth in the 
bomber oval and first in the figure-8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Future Prospects 
</P>
<P>
All of the young Turks of the track appear to have futures, no matter where 
they race when Ascot is closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all drivers would race anything just to get a ride," Birmingham said. 
</P>
<P>
They won't have to beg, it appears. Ascot's reputation, coupled with their 
success here, is expected to get them rides elsewhere when the track closes. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Ascot is one of the premier leaders in racing, particularly in the 
area of promotion," said Chris Boals, national field representative for the 
National Assn. of Stock Car Racing, during a recent visit to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot has been a proving ground for many top auto racers. Ten of the 33 racers 
in last month's Indianapolis 500 have raced at Ascot. In 1988, 14 of the 
drivers at Indy had performed at Ascot in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the home boys, Jones probably has the greatest chance at moving on to Indy 
cars. In fact, he says that following in his father's footsteps is a goal. 
"This is a steppingstone where you learn the basics," he said of the dirt track 
at Ascot. "You make a mistake here, it's not going to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damp Odor of Dirt 
</P>
<P>
Pedregon likens Ascot to his home. It is a unique place, he said, right down to 
the damp odor of the slick track and the brown adobe mud that clings to shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are at Ascot, you know it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask anyone in the United States (who knows racing) about Ascot and they will 
tell you that this is one of the premier dirt tracks in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Laney calls the Ascot oval "a driver's track," and says racers who compete here 
often fare better in out-of-town races. Kirby's road record seems to verify 
that. 
</P>
<P>
But even with this year's live Thursday night ESPN coverage, which concluded 
June 1, Ascot has suffered from a lack of exposure, and the youthful drivers 
say that has hurt their image. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "The crowd factor has hurt. We just can't get L.A. people to go to 
the races. There are so many other things to do here." 
</P>
<P>
Boals says there is no doubt each of the young drivers would receive more 
attention in areas like the Midwest and South, where all forms of racing are 
highly popular. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys would be heroes in small towns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Late afternoon rays from an orange sun cast shadows onto the mud-stained 
billboards around the track as Kirby remained in the infield. No, he would not 
race today, he said once again. Maybe he would work in the pits. He could race. 
He just did not want to. 
</P>
<P>
When all the cars were off the track, he negotiated the muddy surface and 
jumped over the retaining wall, disappearing into the pits. He would not race, 
but there would be other times, just as there had been before.

SAN MARINO COACH: 'NOBODY'S A LOSER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For longtime baseball coach Mickey McNamee of San Marino High, it wasn't quite 
the ending that he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee was hoping that his team could complete a surprising season with a CIF 
Southern Section 2-A championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans fell a little short. San Marino lost to El Segundo, 7-4, in the 
title game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But, all things considered, McNamee said he has plenty of reasons to be proud 
of San Marino's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get this far nobody's a loser," he said. "We're extremely proud of 
the year we had. We're not going to hang our heads." 
</P>
<P>
The team finished better than most people had expected at the start of the 
season. "No one felt we could get this far, so that's a big accomplishment for 
us," junior pitcher Dan Giddings said. 
</P>
<P>
With most of its top players having graduated from a team that was 14-11 and 
reached the 2-A quarterfinals last year, McNamee started with the modest goal 
of reaching the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get to the playoffs you have a chance to make it (to the championship 
game)," McNamee said. 
</P>
<P>
That has been an achievable goal over the years for San Marino, which has 
reached the Southern Section playoffs 19 of the last 21 years. The school had 
made the finals three times in McNamee's 26 years as coach, including division 
titles in 1977 and 1984. So it wasn't surprising to see the Titans in 
postseason play again. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino finished the regular season second to Temple City in the Rio Hondo 
League at 12-3 and 18-3 overall. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the playoffs, despite the fact that the Titans were not among 
the seeded teams, Giddings liked his team's chances: 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the year, our feeling was just to get to the playoffs. 
Once we got there, I knew we could go this far. We felt good about the way we 
played to get here." 
</P>
<P>
San Marino defeated Bloomington, 10-6; Whittier Christian, 5-1; fourth-seeded 
St. Bernard, 7-3, and top-seeded Gladstone, 4-3, to reach the championship 
game. The Titans beat Gladstone with three runs in the bottom of the last 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee said the team entered the finals with hitting, pitching and defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans finished the season with a solid .334 batting average. The leaders 
were senior shortstop Marty Willhite, who had a .438 average, three home runs 
and 34 runs batted in; junior third baseman Blair Slattery at .407 with 24 
RBIs, senior second baseman David Kadin at .351 and junior outfielder Mark 
Ukropina at .346 with 32 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers compiled an impressive 2.15 earned-run average. The leaders were 
Giddings at 9-2 with a 2.77 ERA and junior Michael Wan at 8-1 with a 2.27 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
It was defense that let the Titans down in the championship game. In five 
innings as a starter, Giddings allowed only three earned runs. But El Segundo 
took advantage of four San Marino errors to take an insurmountable 7-2 lead 
after five. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem very simply was we did not play a very good defensive game," 
McNamee said. "We did not make the defensive plays when we had to and 
consequently they took advantage of our mistakes, and that's what a good team 
does." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We certainly hit the ball well enough (eight hits), and Giddings 
pitched well enough to be in the game. We just didn't make the plays behind 
him. If we played defense, it could have been a different game." 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, the Titans were left a little defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
Not the best way to finish a successful season. San Marino ended the year at 
22-4 and El Segundo -- winning its sixth Southern Section baseball title since 
1965 -- was 26-5. 
</P>
<P>
Giddings said the defeat "gives us a little incentive for next year. I don't 
like dealing with next year right now, but I think it gives us a goal to reach 
out for." 
</P>
<P>
For Giddings, playing in the Southern Section championship at Dodger Stadium 
fulfilled a lifelong desire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I'll definitely remember," he said. "When I was young, I always 
dreamed about playing at Dodger Stadium and to have had the chance was great. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would've liked to win it. Hopefully we can get back here and win it next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
With several top starters returning, that prospect appears to be a distinct 
possibility.

ROCKWELL MEETS WITH RESIDENTS OVER POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since reports were released three weeks ago about chemical 
and radioactive pollution at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory, company officials met with a homeowner group in an attempt to quell 
fears about contamination threatening neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 residents attended the meeting Tuesday sponsored by the Susana Knolls 
Homeowner Assn., a group of about 400 families who live on the edge of Simi 
Valley about 1 1/2 miles northeast of the 2,668-acre complex. The meeting was 
the first in a series to be held with concerned citizens by officials from 
Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, which operates the lab. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocketdyne is very committed to cleaning up problems caused by Rocketdyne," 
said Steve Lafflam, environmental manager for the site. "We'll guarantee 
nothing is moving off-site," he said, offering assurances that no pollution has 
left the company's property. 
</P>
<P>
"Four thousand Rocketdyne employees live within a 10-mile radius of the lab, 
including the president and 14 of the vice presidents," said Mel Davis, vice 
president for human resources and communication. "The people who know what is 
going on there would not be living there if it was unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
Radioactive and chemical pollution of a portion of the complex in Ventura 
County three miles west of Chatsworth and two miles southeast of Simi Valley 
was described in a preliminary report released last month by the U.S. 
Department of Energy, which has contracted with Rocketdyne for nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1947 and 1986, nuclear research was conducted on a 290-acre portion of 
the site, part of which was leased by the DOE. About 12 nuclear reactors 
operated there, including the first plant in the United States to provide 
nuclear-powered energy to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The DOE report found that while the pollution poses no immediate threat to 
nearby residents, more environmental tests are necessary to determine the 
extent of the contamination because of inadequacies in the company's 
ground-water monitoring system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slides Displayed 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne officials Tuesday displayed slides showing charts, graphs and 
documents tracing the history of the firm's activities and cleanup procedures 
at the site. The one-hour presentation was followed by five company officials 
replying to questions from the audience, passed to them in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it possible homeowners are in danger?" one person asked. 
</P>
<P>
Davis replied that "homeowners are not in danger -- period." 
</P>
<P>
One question concerned a field where radioactive water had leaked in the 1970s. 
Rocketdyne removed the contaminated soil and covered the area with asphalt and 
soil eight to 10 feet deep, however the DOE survey said residual radiation 
remained in the underlying bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
The questioner asked why the firm was soliciting additional nuclear work when 
it had not "even cleaned up the mess already up there?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$17 Million Spent 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne officials said the company has spent $17 million so far to clean up 
the site. "What's gone on up there has nothing to do with the recent jobs," 
said Hank C. Wiezeneck, a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"If you planted a field of cabbage on that area we cleaned up and ate the 
cabbages for a year, you'd only have three extra hours of exposure to 
radioactivity than you'd normally have" in a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No nuclear work is now being done at the site, but Rocketdyne officials have 
said the company plans to bid on contracts with DOE to recycle spent nuclear 
fuel rods. The lab is now used to test rocket engines for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The DOE report said that in one area of the Rocketdyne site, known as the 
sodium burn pit, soil tests revealed levels of radioactive cesium as high as 
700 picocuries per gram of soil -- about 10 to 30 times higher than normal 
background radiation for the area.

Lafflam said that sitting in the burn pit for a day "would be the equivalent of 
spending the day in Denver," which gets more solar radiation because of its 
altitude.

Superfund List 
</P>
<P>
The lab has been on the state Superfund cleanup list for several years because 
of high levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a chemical solvent, in ground 
water beneath the complex. Rocketdyne has been treating ground water in one 
part of the property where TCE has been found at levels of up to 11,000 parts 
per billion, 2,200 times the amount that would be allowed in drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
The lab has a state permit to release treated water used to cool rocket engines 
into Bell Creek, which runs south into the community of Bell Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day our waste water is monitored for radioactivity and chemicals. We 
have never experienced any problems in the water released into Bell Creek," 
Lafflam said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Stolnow, 71, a retired accountant, said he felt reassured by the 
presentation. "I never felt there was a critical need to get too excited about 
what's happening up there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dawn Kowalski, a member of the association's board of directors, said she 
was still skeptical about the truthfulness of the presentation. "I'd like to 
see an independent organization tell us about what's going on up there," she 
said.

BRONCO SLUGGER GOLDBACH NAMED 2ND-TEAM ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona baseball team didn't win the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. title or reach the NCAA Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Broncos have the most players among CCAA teams on the Division II 
All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who finished second in the CCAA at 17-13 and 24-28 overall, placed 
catcher Chris Goldbach on the second team and outfielder Chris Butterfield and 
third baseman Dave Hajek on the third squad. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Rex De La Nuez of Cal State Los Angeles was named to the second 
team. 
</P>
<P>
For Goldbach, the selection caps a brilliant senior season. Selected CCAA Most 
Valuable Player, Goldbach led the conference with a .387 batting average, 53 
runs batted in, 79 hits and 19 doubles and was second with seven home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield, a junior, finished with a conference-leading nine home runs, a 
.361 batting average and 36 RBIs. Senior Hajek led the Broncos in runs with 56 
and stolen bases with 16 and batted .354. 
</P>
<P>
De La Nuez, a junior, topped the Golden Eagles with a .361 average, 17 doubles, 
44 RBIs and 22 stolen bases and was second with seven home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Hecox of South Hills High in West Covina, considered one of the top prep 
distance runners in the state, has been invited to compete in the high school 
girls mile at the Jack in the Box Invitational Track Meet on Aug. 6 at UCLA's 
Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Hecox, a junior, finished third in the 1,600 meters in a swift 4:55.48 at the 
CIF state track meet last week. Hecox won the state title in the 3,200 as a 
sophomore and posted the fastest time of 10:41.23 in the 3,200 at the CIF 
Southern Section Masters Meet two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other top milers expected to compete are Becky Spies of Livermore, 
Deena Drossin of Agoura, Reyna Cervantes of Montebello and Ashley Black of 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Two high school teams from the San Gabriel Valley have been honored as academic 
champions as part of the CIF Southern Section's annual Angels/Ford Academic 
Awards Program. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Poly's baseball team, which posted a combined grade-point average of 
3.29, and the San Marino girls basketball squad, which compiled an average of 
3.59, received awards along with teams from 19 other sports. 
</P>
<P>
Seven boys and 11 girls from the valley were listed among student athletes of 
the year in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
The boys are Erik Bars of Azusa, Frank Sarver of Charter Oak, Art Gilliland of 
Claremont, John Akerboom of El Monte, Winston Chamberlain of Maranatha, Harry 
Joe of Rio Hondo Prep and Brian Sax of San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
The girls are Menaka Vasudev of Azusa, Elizabeth Klatt of Bonita, Danielle 
Allen of Claremont, Patricia Perez of El Monte, Gloria Wang of Mark Keppel, 
Britta Jeromin of Maranatha, Carol Cho of Northview, Karen Miyake of Rio Hondo 
Prep, Roxy Protasovicki of San Marino, Amy Schroeder of Western Christian and 
Grace Moon of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
All posted a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and Chamberlain, Allen and Jeromin posted 
perfect averages of 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
Four players have been added to the East roster for the 10th annual National 
Football Foundation and Hall of Fame All-Star Game on July 21 at Citrus College 
in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The players are defensive linemen Tom Bell of Azusa and Eddie Andrade of 
Baldwin Park, wide receiver Walter Pittman of Workman and linebacker Jeff 
Parness of Wilson. 
</P>

BEST COUNTY SENIORS TO COMPARE WARES IN NORTH-SOUTH GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County all-star baseball game, which will be played Sunday at 1 
p.m. at Moorpark College, means something different to every player. 
</P>
<P>
To pitcher John Boardman of Camarillo Christian, it's a chance to prove he can 
retire hitters at a more competitive level. Boardman was 12-4 and struck out a 
county-high 170 batters in the Small Schools Division. 
</P>
<P>
To pitcher Brad Edmonds of Fillmore, it's a chance to replace the unpleasant 
memory of his team's eight errors in a 10-7 loss to Beaumont in the 1-A 
Division final Friday. 
</P>
<P>
To outfielder Jason Jones of Royal, it's a chance to display the power that 
produced a county-high nine home runs. Jones and other long-ball launchers will 
compete in a home-run hitting contest before the game. 
</P>
<P>
To catcher Danny Madsen of Newbury Park, it's a chance to test his arm against 
fleet baserunners like Ty Hewitt of Buena and Chris Cole of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
To Mike Jenkins and Rick Langford of Marmonte League champion Simi Valley, it's 
a chance to pitch against the top hitters of the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
To Matt Anderson of Channel League champion Buena, it's a chance to pitch 
against the top hitters of the Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who will play for the North team, is also looking forward to watching 
Thousand Oaks' John Bushart pitch for the South team. Anderson and Bushart, 
both hard-throwing left-handers, have scholarships to play for Cal State 
Northridge next year. "I'm interested in watching Bushart throw," Anderson 
said. "We're probably going to be teammates next year." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson qualifies his comment because he could opt to sign with the Baltimore 
Orioles, who selected him in the fifth round of the amateur draft Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This game ought to be great fun," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine of the county's top seniors have been invited to play in the 
all-star game, which is sure to draw plenty of college and professional scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Buena's Stan Hedegard and Santa Paula's Mark Magdaleno are co-coaches of the 
North team. Fillmore's Tom Ecklund and Moorpark's Mario Porto are co-coaches of 
the South team. 
</P>
<P>
The South team will have no shortage of pitchers, according to Porto. "We have 
nine guys who throw, so they'll each probably pitch one inning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The North team has only five pitchers. The North offense will be led by 
power-hitting infielders John Johnson (.383, 5 home runs) of Channel Islands 
and Tom Lunsford (.431, 6 home runs) of Buena. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jones (.446) and Madsen (.369, 6 home runs), the South offense 
features outfielders Geoff Black (.455, 6 home runs) of Newbury Park and Chris 
Grodell (.468) of Thousand Oaks, and three infielders from Simi Valley -- Jesse 
Anguiano (.405), Andy Hodgins (.442) and Terry Hill (.419).

AQUINO-MUSGROVE BOXING MATCH AT VENTURA THEATRE IN TALKING STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speculation that former North American Boxing Federation and World Boxing 
Council junior middleweight champion Lupe Aquino of Santa Paula might appear on 
the May boxing card at the Ventura Theatre became moot when the promoters 
canceled the card. Lonnie Smith, a middleweight from Las Vegas who was 
scheduled to box in the main event, injured his hip during a sparing bout and 
called off the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We got jammed up on time to do anything else so I decided to call off the show 
so we can put on a quality show in July," said promoter Paul Konapelsky. 
</P>
<P>
With May's program a bust, Konapelsky is looking at July and August cards. And 
the name Aquino once again is coming to the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Said Konapelsky:"We would like to shoot for an August date for a possible 
Aquino -- Larry Musgrove fight." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sayatovich, Aquino's manager, says he has not been contacted. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know who these people are," he said. "I'm sitting right here by 
the phone waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"If they ever call, I will say we will fight Musgrove or anyone, any place, any 
time. Lupe is a devastating fighter again and he has been knocking people out 
with body punches, so bring them on." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Musgrove's manager, Jason Schlessinger, is talking as if the deal is 
almost complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry said he definitely wants to fight Aquino," he said, adding that he will 
contact "Aquino's manager with an offer." 
</P>
<P>
Any questions about Aquino's eligibility to fight locally or in California were 
dispelled by California State Athletic Commission executive director Ken Gray, 
who said, "We have no problem with Lupe fighting anywhere at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Schlessinger has high hopes for Musgrove, who won the World Boxing Association 
Americas middleweight title on a unanimous decision over Tim Williams at the 
Ventura Theatre in April. He would like to see the Aquino -- Musgrove fight 
come off in Ventura and be used as a springboard for bigger and better things 
for his boxer. 
</P>
<P>
While the on again, off again controversy about Aquino fighting before a 
supportive Ventura crowd continues, it appears that each passing month brings 
Aquino a little closer to a confirmed date, probably August or September. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the Aquino bantering, Konapelsky has been working on a program for 
June, but no live boxing at the theatre is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Konapelsky has received the rights from Top Rank Inc. to show the Leonard -- 
Hearns fight on closed circuit in Ventura County areas where no cable or 
pay-per-view is available. Confirmed sites for the closed circuit broadcast 
are: Thousand Oaks Holiday Inn, Cheer's and Hap's in Simi Valley, Canyon Club 
and Oak Pit Grill in Agoura Hills and the Santa Clarita Lanes in Saugus.

TROUBLES IN GOTHAM VILLAGE? WARNERS ESCHEWS BATBASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE and JACK MATHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Wayne, the comic strip philanthropist and playboy who moonlights as the 
crime buster Batman, has inspired Warner Bros. to donate more than $100,000 to 
Zahn Memorial Center for Social Services in Los Angeles rather than throw the 
Westwood Batbash it had planned for the West Coast launch of the film "Batman". 
</P>
<P>
Zahn is operated by the Salvation Army and the money will be earmarked for the 
L.A. homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to think in the spirit of Batman -- who works to better Gotham, if 
you will," said Warners' advertising chief Rob Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said the decision to drop plans to turn Westwood Village into a 
one-night Gotham was made before any commitments had been made for security, 
catering or set construction, and he acknowledged that the decision was as 
practical as it was philanthropical. 
</P>
<P>
"When you make plans for these events, you have to think on all levels," he 
said. "From a security point of view, we got really afraid." 
</P>
<P>
"They were really afraid of that party," said an industry source who would have 
been involved in the Gotham event. "They would have had 10,000 people there 
trying to see the Batmobile. Somebody would have been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the Gotham party, Warner Bros. is hosting simultaneous 8 p.m. 
premiere screenings June 19 at the 1,500-seat Village Theater and the adjacent 
850-seat Bruin Theater in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger are expected to 
attend the Westwood premiere, Friedman reported, as will Batman creator Bob 
Kane. Friedman said some seats in both theaters will be given away to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.' plans for "Batman" also include a June 22 premiere in Washington 
to benefit the National Zoo. Meanwhile, the studio will fly in journalists from 
all over the country for a publicity junket in Los Angeles next week. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman and other studio executives reacted angrily to published reports 
Tuesday that implied the canceled Gotham party was a bad omen for the movie's 
box-office prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. has kept a tight lid on "Batman" publicity from the day it 
announced the project and has deflected criticism from journalists and Batman 
fans who objected to the casting of comedy actor Keaton in the role of the 
Caped Crusader. 
</P>
<P>
Word about the quality of the film inevitably leaked out after exhibitor 
screenings last week and one exhibitor was quoted in a Los Angeles Herald 
Examiner story Tuesday calling "Batman" "Howard the Bat," a reference to the 
colossal 1987 summer flop "Howard the Duck." 
</P>
<P>
The half-dozen exhibitors contacted by The Times said their screenings went 
well, and most of them said they were confident the film will be a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a combination of 'Superman' and 'Beetlejuice' and a few other things," 
said one exhibitor, who echoed the consensus opinion that the film belongs to 
Jack Nicholson more than Michael Keaton. "It's been a long wait, (but) the 
screening put an end to a lot of worries." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors agreed that the film is darker in theme and more serious in mood 
than fans of the 1960s TV show may be hoping for, but none thought there was a 
chance that the $50-million-plus spectacle would be a flop. 
</P>
<P>
An executive with a major theater chain said he is ebullient about "Batman's" 
prospects, saying his office figures "Batman" will trail only "Indiana Jones 
and the Last Crusade" in summer receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure 'Indiana Jones' will do about $225 million, 'Batman' will do $175 
million, 'Ghostbusters II' will do $150 million and 'Lethal Weapon' about $100 
million," he said. "Whoever called this thing 'Howard the Bat' doesn't have the 
movie booked; I can tell you that."

WORK BEGINS ON NEW EXHIBIT SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction began Wednesday on the Times Mirror Hall of Native American 
Cultures at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The two-level, 10,000-square-foot exhibition space, scheduled to open in 
January, 1991, will focus on the past two centuries and enable the museum to 
bring out of storage its holdings of Native American artifacts, such as part of 
an extensive collection of Navajo textiles. One gallery will offer changing 
exhibits of contemporary Native American art. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror Foundation is founder of the hall. Other major funders include 
Chandis Securities, Mrs. Justin Dart, United States Borax and Chemical Co. and 
First Interstate Bank Foundation.

"You here to cover us mindless cannibals?" a reporter in the House press 
gallery asked a visiting colleague. 
</P>
<P>
If the reporter sounded defensive, forgive him. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ethics investigation of former House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), 
followed by allegations involving House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of Merced 
and Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), some famous fingers have started pointing 
toward the press gallery. 
</P>
<P>
So supercharged has the atmosphere become that Republican operatives circulated 
unsubstantiated rumors about new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley's private life 
among the media. Their antics led Wednesday to the sudden resignation of an 
aide to the Republican National Committee. 
</P>

All this, some in both parties worry, could ultimately undermine public 
confidence in Congress and erode the sense of good will necessary for the 
institution to function. 
</P>
<P>
And the press, they charge, bears a share of the blame as a sometimes reckless 
conduit for rumor, innuendo and allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Is it true? Does the press have any responsibility for what Wright called a 
"period of mindless cannibalism" over ethics? Or is this simply another case of 
blaming the messenger? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, many journalists and legislators agree, is that the press has made 
some mistakes. But the reasons for the current epidemic of ethical charge and 
countercharge go deeper and reflect a confluence of long-building political and 
social forces: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The growing success of attack politics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rise of personal character and the decline of issues as dominant in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A broadening of what is acceptable to talk about in public. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A willingness in Congress to break the code of silence about indiscretions 
among colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they have formed an atmosphere in which events seem to be spinning 
out of the control of both politicians and the reporters who cover them. And 
the most aggressive politicians have taken advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for instance, an aide to Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) reportedly tried 
to goad reporters into writing about Foley's private life on the basis that 
other news organizations were about to break the story. The Washington Post 
reported that the aide, Karen Van Brocklin, had asked one of its reporters 
whether the Post planned any stories about Foley's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said in an interview with The Times that Van Brocklin spoke with 
reporters only when they called her and asked whether she had heard any rumors 
about Foley's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resembled Other Stories 
</P>
<P>
The rumors discussed by Van Brocklin resembled similar accounts that Times 
reporters had already found to be untrue. No major paper wrote a story about 
Foley's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Van Brocklin could not be reached for comment; Gingrich told the Post he had 
instructed her not to talk with reporters any more. 
</P>
<P>
Then, earlier this week, the Republican National Committee issued a memo 
calling Foley "out of the liberal closet" and comparing him to Rep. Barney 
Frank (D-Mass.), a liberal and an acknowledged homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just trying to trap us into using it," said NBC's Andrea Mitchell of 
the Republican technique. 
</P>
<P>
No one used the story directly. But when Frank protested the "innuendo" about 
Foley's personal life, most papers decided that the flap had entered the public 
domain. By Wednesday morning, Foley was on the Cable News Network saying: "I 
am, of course, not a homosexual." 
</P>
<P>
Copley News Service reporter Finlay Lewis called it "the story from hell." 
</P>
<P>
To some, the press seemed too willing a conduit for unsubstantiated 
allegations. "Of course (the media) have something to do with the probe" of 
Wright, former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) charged on 
"Nightline" before the memo about Foley had surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assails Press 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), an author of ethics legislation covering Congress, 
accused the press of "mean-mindedness and reckless disregard for balance." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the press' behavior has raised questions even in the press gallery. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Newsweek cover story on Congress charged that today's lawmakers care 
more about personal fame than about producing laws. Many politicians and 
journalists took issue. 
</P>
<P>
Many also questioned a CBS report based on anonymous sources May 30 that the 
"FBI has opened a criminal investigation into financial dealings involving 
Democratic Rep. William H. Gray III of Philadelphia." Now, more than a week 
later, all that is clear is that the FBI is looking into an "allegation" that 
an employee on Gray's staff might have been paid without showing up for work. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Foley story emerged this week, New Republic reporter Fred 
Barnes and syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak printed that 
unsubstantiated rumors were circulating about the private lives of House 
members. Justifying their accounts, they argued that the rumors would have 
political impact on their subjects, including Foley and Coelho, whether the 
rumors were true or not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coelho Denounces Story 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who announced his resignation from Congress after stories described his 
profits from a junk bond purchase in 1986, aimed his criticism at The Times. He 
denounced as wrong a story quoting anonymous sources as saying the Justice 
Department had opened a preliminary investigation into his financial dealings 
with the brokerage firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand by our story," said Shelby Coffey III, editor of The Times. The 
Washington Post has since confirmed the article. 
</P>
<P>
But by most accounts, the press is not solely responsible for the present 
preoccupation with ethics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most fundamental factor, say politicians and journalists, is the 
rise of attack politics. 
</P>
<P>
Until even a few years ago, political consultants say, negative politics was 
considered a kind of political nitroglycerin, best handled with care. 
</P>
<P>
"But the whole attack theory of politics now is that as long as you can keep on 
the offensive and keep the other guy on the defensive you will win," Republican 
political consultant Doug Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, George Bush even helped himself throw off his "wimp" label by 
attacking Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
All that is carrying over now into the politics of governing. "We have now 
trained an entire generation of politicians to rely on negative politics as a 
way of being successful," said former Democratic political consultant Bob 
Beckel. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of attack politics is helping break down the code of silence that 
members of Congress once honored when they learned of indiscretions by their 
fellow members. Michael McCurry, a press specialist with the Democratic 
National Committee, described a "palpable sense of grief by members of the 
Senate" when Sen. Harrison J. Williams (D-N.J.) was convicted in the Abscam 
scandal in 1982. McCurry was Williams' press secretary at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But when Wright and Coelho resigned last month, the Republican National 
Campaign Committee prepared a briefing paper trying to capitalize on their 
fall, ascribing their "corruption" to 35 years of uninterrupted Democratic 
dominance of the House. 
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the rise of attack politics is a fundamental shift in politics 
away from issues and toward character. At the presidential level, character has 
dominated at least since Franklin D. Roosevelt sold confidence on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
But now candidates for Congress and even local office commonly run on 
character, too. And sometimes when they resort to issues, as Bush did last year 
with prison furloughs and the Pledge of Allegiance, it is largely to define 
their character. 
</P>
<P>
Television, political consultant Bailey said, is one of the reasons. "TV allows 
people to make those kinds of personal judgments about someone, and that 
reduces the importance of issues," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, political attacks are becoming increasingly personal. A watershed, said 
press critic Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, was the 
downfall of former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart as a Democratic presidential 
candidate last year over reports of his suspected adulterous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Today, said American Enterprise Institute scholar William Schneider, "nothing 
is out of bounds" for politicians and press to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to that atmosphere, many political observers say, are increasingly 
permissive standards about what is appropriate for television. Bailey said 
political consultants watch "L.A. Law" and "thirtysomething" -- not to mention 
such so-called tabloid TV as "Inside Edition" and the "Morton Downey Jr. Show" 
-- to decide what politicians can talk about in campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
And contributing to the press' focus on ethics has been the relative absence of 
substantive issues in Congress this year. "This is a story that grew legs 
because there wasn't much action anywhere else," McCurry said.

RANCHO SECO NUCLEAR PLANT SHUTDOWN BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT CLOSURE BY VOTERS, FIRST OF ITS KIND, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT 
ON OTHER FACILITIES 
</P>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Seco slipped into "hot shutdown" Wednesday at 10:40 a.m., becoming the 
first operating nuclear power plant closed by popular vote, but the event was 
discounted as a unique Sacramento phenomenon with little effect on the rest of 
the nuclear industry or the anti-nuclear movement. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts on both sides of the issue acknowledged the election as a setback for 
the image of nuclear energy. But they added that the circumstances behind the 
vote -- a history of breakdowns, public ownership and widely disliked and 
mistrusted management -- are unlikely to be repeated elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should think the vote to close Rancho Seco automatically means other 
nuclear power plants can be closed by citizens' initiatives," said Bob 
Mulholland of Campaign California, a Santa Monica-based political group that 
played a key role in defeating Rancho Seco. "But it will get everyone's 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Goldstein of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a Washington-based 
nuclear industry lobbying group, called the vote "a referendum on SMUD (the 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District), not nuclear power." 
</P>
<P>
"It's never good news when something like this happens," he added, "but it's 
not the beginning of the end of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Some groups broke from the consensus -- Public Citizen, a consumerist group 
affiliated with Ralph Nader, called the election "the beginning of the end for 
nuclear power" -- but the first successful anti-nuclear ballot measure in 15 
attempts was not widely expected to spark a series of similar grass-roots 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
What many think it may do -- and there already was some confirming evidence 
Wednesday -- is revive practically moribund anti-nuclear campaigns that have 
labored unsuccessfully for at least the last 10 years to close other operating 
power plants or prevent new ones from firing up. 
</P>
<P>
One example is the Maryland Safe Energy Coalition, which has fruitlessly 
battled against the troubled but recently rebuilt Peachbottom nuclear facility 
run by Philadelphia Electric Co. in southeastern Pennsylvania. That multi-unit 
facility has been fined for, among other things, having operators who slept on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We had used the safety issue, concentrating on design problems, operating 
problems, maintenance problems," said Patricia Birnie of Columbia, Md. "But now 
it is clear the economic angle is much more effective. They concentrated on the 
economics in Sacramento, and they won." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voters Were Annoyed 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the outcome of the Rancho Seco election was the plant's 
historically poor performance -- a problem that irritated voters because it 
cost the district hundreds of millions of dollars over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
However, several factors -- the need to know whether to sign contracts for more 
nuclear fuel or replacement power -- forced SMUD to seek Wednesday's vote of 
confidence before the district believed it had an adequate opportunity to prove 
Rancho Seco's new reliability. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, anti-nuclear activists were able to deflect the low cost of 
nuclear energy in general by noting the unreliability of this particular 
nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept this election focused on the cost-effectiveness of Rancho Seco. That's 
why we won," said Mulholland, whose group used the social and political 
connections of its founder, Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), to fund a 
large share of the anti-Rancho campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously some well-running nuclear plants in America," he said. 
"There are, however, a number of plants that run poorly. Those plants will now 
be held to a new standard -- are they cost-effective?" 
</P>
<P>
However, even poorly run plants do not have the burden of being wholly owned by 
municipal power companies, which are much more sensitive to transient politics 
because they are quasi-governmental agencies with popularly elected boards of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Ownership 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said all other U.S. nuclear plants are at least partly operated by 
private, investor-owned utilities. To close those plants by popular vote would 
almost certainly require that the government first buy the plant from its 
private owners -- a multibillion-dollar proposition that no state or local 
government could afford. 
</P>
<P>
"This was unique because it was the first time that there was a clear 
referendum on a plant," said Stuart Wilson, assistant executive director of the 
California Municipal Utilities Assn. "It's the first time, for a vote of this 
kind, that there was no legal dispute in the court over the people's right to 
speak on a plant." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Seco also was unique, many analysts noted, because its popularly elected 
board of directors was so unpopular. Frequent public bickering among its 
members, particularly over repairs at Rancho Seco, have made the board a common 
target of scorn. 
</P>
<P>
It was particularly resented by SMUD employees, a rift noted by outside 
industry experts from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. INPO, as the 
industry-sponsored watchdog group is known, said last April that a successful 
reconstruction of Rancho Seco was unlikely to solve the district's problems 
because of conflicts on the board, including the frequent turnover of top 
management working directly with the board. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems may continue as Rancho Seco is slowly switched off, or 
decommissioned. Some SMUD employees are publicly critical of the board's most 
frequent critic of nuclear power, Ed Smeloff, who already has proposed trying 
to find another way to fuel the non-nuclear generating equipment at Rancho 
Seco. 
</P>
<P>
Smeloff has suggested using natural gas to create steam for the electrical 
generators. Such a conversion for an operating nuclear power plant is 
unprecedented, although one plant in Michigan was converted from nuclear to gas 
before its first load of uranium was installed. An active Colorado plant is 
said to be under study for such a conversion as well. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plan would pose special problems in Sacramento, however, because the 
Sacramento Valley suffers a serious air pollution problem. Adding a plant that 
burns fossil fuel and belches smoke would require the district to pay millions 
to add smog control equipment to factories in the area. Smeloff said he 
believes the district has several options in this area. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the focus is on pulling the plug on Rancho Seco. 
</P>
<P>
Hot shutdown -- in which the plant does not generate electricity but continues 
to generate heat from its nuclear pile -- will last 72 hours, a plant 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
When the interior temperature dips below 200 degrees Fahrenheit, it will be in 
cold shutdown and the nuclear chain reaction will stop. It will remain in this 
mode for several months while radiation levels drop. 
</P>
<P>
Once safe enough, the nuclear fuel will be removed from the reactor and stored 
on site until a federal nuclear repository opens, probably not before 2008. 
Then the coolant water will be drained and treated to eliminate radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the plant will be sealed up according to regulations issued last year 
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It then will sit idle -- under the 
constant supervision of nuclear caretakers -- until part of the facility is 
reused with natural gas or until radiation levels have dropped low enough to 
let wrecking crews cut the plant in pieces and haul it away to the nuclear 
repository. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO SHUT DOWN RANCHO SECO 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the general steps for shutting down the Rancho Seco nuclear power 
plant as explained by a member of its board of directors: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Hot shutdown," halting electricity production but retaining critical mass 
in the reactor, thus still creating heat. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Cold shutdown," inserting control rods into the reactor to stop the chain 
reaction and critical mass, starting the process of reducing temperatures and 
pressures inside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
3. After several months, removal of nuclear fuel in spent and partially spent 
form, to be stored at Rancho Seco pending permanent disposal elsewhere years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
4. Drain fluids, mostly the water used in the heat-transfer systems, after 
treating to remove radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
5. De-energize, or unplug, some electrical systems not needed when plant is 
mothballed, such as large cranes not needed by an idled plant. 
</P>
<P>
6. Seal the containment building housing the reactor according to Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission standards, then lock up the nuclear side of the plant and 
monitor the remaining plant systems to prevent radioactive release. 
Non-nuclear, steam-driven turbines and generators could be modified and used 
later, fired by a natural gas energy source.

HOUSE VOTES FOR LIMITS ON FSX DEAL WITH JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The House voted Wednesday to attach some restrictions to the U.S. agreement 
with Japan for joint U.S.-Japanese development of that country's proposed FSX 
advanced fighter aircraft -- risking a possible veto and a serious 
confrontation with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed on a vote of 241 to 168, is identical to one that the 
Senate passed last month. While approving the FSX deal in principle, it would 
prohibit the United States from providing Tokyo with the technology for 
building the engine for the new plane. 
</P>
<P>
It also would put Congress formally on record as insisting that U.S. firms be 
awarded "at least 40%" of any contracts if the fighter ever actually goes into 
production. The new aircraft would be patterned after the American-made F-16. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tougher Changes Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Senate passage of the measure last month initially was regarded as a victory 
for the Administration. The Senate last month and the House on Wednesday both 
rejected tougher amendments that would have rejected the entire accord. The 
measure now goes to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House has said since the Senate vote that Bush regards the 
language as too restrictive and an intrusion on presidential negotiating 
authority and has warned that he is likely to veto the resolution in the form 
that it has been passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the key votes on the restrictive language suggest that 
opponents of the FSX deal in both houses may now be able to muster the 
two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto, thus forcing Bush 
to live with the language. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the Administration would decide to go 
ahead with the FSX project if Congress were to override a presidential veto, or 
whether Bush ultimately would feel forced to ask Japan to renegotiate the 
arrangement to take account of Congress' desires. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said they would have to study the language more 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
White House advisers have been warning that Japan may refuse to continue with 
the project if it requires that the deal be renegotiated. Tokyo initially 
wanted to build the fighter entirely on its own and acceded to co-development 
only after strong U.S. pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote in the House came amid a torrent of anti-Japanese rhetoric by 
lawmakers of both parties, who argued that Japan should have bought the 
U.S.-made F-16 instead to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depriving U.S. Firms 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) warned that forcing the Administration to ask Japan 
to renegotiate the FSX accord would only prompt Japan to go to European 
aircraft makers instead, thus depriving U.S. firms of some $2.3 billion in 
likely contracts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. aircraft makers have said the American firms participating in the FSX 
project were likely to earn almost as much from co-development of the project 
as they would if Japan had bought the F-16. Development costs for a fighter far 
outweigh production costs. 
</P>
<P>
The key vote in the House on Wednesday came as the lawmakers endorsed, 252 to 
155, an amendment proposed by Rep. Terry L. Bruce (D-Ill.) that added the 
restrictions to the resolution. The Senate vote on a similar amendment was 72 
to 25. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House approved, 320 to 98, a measure by Rep. Gerald B. H. Solomon 
(R-N.Y.) that would have blocked the FSX accord entirely. However, that 
resolution was discarded when the Bruce provision was approved. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruce provision -- and an identical amendment proposed in the Senate by 
former Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) -- were intended as 
compromises. Opponents of the FSX deal had conceded in advance they did not 
have the votes to block the accord completely. 
</P>
<P>
The FSX arrangement has become a focal point for a major debate over U.S. trade 
and economic relations with Japan -- specifically, whether the United States 
was "giving away" valuable commercial secrets in the deal that Japan could 
later exploit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated Technology 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, both within the Administration and in Congress, charged that the 
accord would give Japan sophisticated technology that it later could use to 
build a civilian aircraft industry that would topple the United States as the 
leader in the field. 
</P>
<P>
But Defense Department officials -- as well as executives of several U.S. 
civilian aircraft manufacturing companies -- said the technology involved in 
the FSX was primarily military and would not be transferable to civilian 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
The accord was negotiated over 18 months by the outgoing Reagan Administration. 
The Bush Administration had been expected to accept it intact, but wound up 
renegotiating the deal once after Congress and the Commerce Department raised 
concerns about commercial issues.

DINOSAUR DEATH-BY-COMET THEORY GETS NEW SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists examining ancient rocks have detected organic molecules that they 
believe could only have been deposited when an extraterrestrial object, 
probably a comet, crashed into the Earth 65 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers say the finding lends powerful support to the hotly debated 
theory that a cosmic collision threw up a worldwide dust cloud that hampered 
photosynthesis and set off a mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other 
animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists, however, say there are puzzling questions in the report and 
that the cause of the extinctions is still in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The detection of two extraterrestrial amino acids in rock layers deposited 
around the time of the mass extinction represents "the final nail in the 
coffin" of volcanism as an explanation for the mass extinction, said Jeffrey L. 
Bada, professor of marine chemistry at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
"We have provided completely independent molecular evidence that there's no 
question that a large object hit the Earth 65 million years ago," Bada said. He 
advances no opinion on whether the impact actually caused the dinosaurs to die 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Alvarez, a UC Berkeley geology professor who remains among the strongest 
proponents of the impact theory, sees the amino acids -- which are the 
essential building blocks of proteins -- as strong evidence for the theory. "I 
can't imagine how you can explain it any other way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bada and graduate student Meixun Zhao reported the results in today's issue of 
the scientific journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
However, their findings appear unlikely to change the minds of those who look 
to intense volcanism, rather than an object from outer space, to account for 
the geological evidence of a cataclysm 65 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting. But you've got people who are true believers and people who 
are skeptics. If you're a true believer, you'll grasp at any straw that 
supports your case. If you're a skeptic, you too will grasp at any straw that 
supports your case," said Charles L. Drake, professor of earth sciences at 
Dartmouth College and a major proponent of the volcanism theory. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some scientists regard the Bada-Zhao conclusions as premature because the 
amino acids were found in larger amounts than would be expected after a cosmic 
collision, and because the deposits were located above and below -- but not in 
-- the geologic layer that marks the time of the extinctions. 
</P>
<P>
The key evidence for the impact theory has been deposits of a rare element, 
iridium, in sedimentary rock layers that were laid down about 65 million years 
ago, around the time when dinosaurs disappeared. The idea was first published 
in 1980 by Alvarez, his late father Luis, Helen Michel and Frank Asaro. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics have contended that intense volcanism could both have 
deposited the iridium and extinguished the species. Others argue that no single 
factor was responsible for the mass extinction because the extinction was 
already in progress at the time as a result of other, more gradual processes. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike iridium, the two amino acids detected by Bada and Zhao could not have 
come from massive volcanic eruptions because the molecules are destroyed by 
heat, the researchers say in their Nature report. Furthermore, the amino acids 
are common not in the Earth but in meteorites, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Working over the last four years, they developed tedious purification methods 
to isolate billionth-of-a-gram quantities of the two amino acids. They worked 
with one- to two-ounce samples of rocks collected by the Alvarezes at a known 
iridium site in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
They found the molecules, isovaline and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, or AIB, 
present in quantities up to 2,000 times higher than in both deeper and 
shallower rocks taken from the same site in Stevns Klint, Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
The amino acids were not found in rocks taken from sites where there is no 
iridium layer. 
</P>
<P>
These molecules were ideal targets for confirming the impact theory because 
they are exceedingly rare on Earth and are not known to be formed during 
geologic processes but are common in meteorites, Bada said. Neither substance 
can even be used by plants or animals, because their structure varies from that 
of the amino acids in proteins that are the workhorse molecules in all living 
things. 
</P>
<P>
The AIB and isovaline were found in such large quantities that the most likely 
explanation for their origin would be a comet, because it consists mainly of 
water that could harbor the amino acids and their precursor molecules, whereas 
a rocky asteroid could contain fewer of both, Bada said. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is this "embarrassment of riches" that cosmo-chemist Edward Anders 
of the University of Chicago says is the biggest obstacle to this Bada-Zhao 
hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
For delicate amino acids to have survived an impact in such quantities, a major 
part of the object would have to have survived the collision, implying a soft 
impact that would seem unlikely, Anders said. 
</P>
<P>
Bada suggests that the amino acids were plentiful because they may have somehow 
resynthesized during the impact process. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, previous analysis by Anders and others at Chicago found no "noble" 
gases in the rocks around the iridium layer, yet they would have been more 
likely to have survived an impact than amino acids would have, he noted. Noble 
gases are inert elements common throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the AIB and isovaline were found not in the iridium-containing layer but 
in rocks that were a foot to a yard above or below the iridium. Bada said the 
amino acids may have slowly migrated after the impact, accounting for that, an 
explanation that deep-sea sedimentologist Wolfgang Berger at Scripps said is 
plausible. 
</P>
<P>
Anders, who thinks the Bada-Zhao conclusions may be premature, nevertheless 
said he has no doubts about Bada's methods. 
</P>
<P>
"He is going at it in a very responsible way," Anders said. "He is not a 
trigger-happy person who comes up with an interesting result and makes a big 
splash. He has sat on this data and worked on this problem for several years 
trying to verify it in every possible way." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, if the amino acids prove to have come from a comet, the 
researchers will have shown something that international expeditions to study 
Halley's Comet in 1986 were unable to do, Anders noted.

BLUE CROSS TO HIKE SOME RATES 25%, CUT BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue Cross on July 1 will increase health insurance rates an average of 25% for 
its 550,000 individual California policyholders under the age of 65, while at 
the same time announcing broad benefit cutbacks that will take effect at the 
end of the summer, a spokeswoman for the insurer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
These changes do not apply to Blue Cross group plans, many of which have also 
been subject to rate increases in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Medicare supplement policies carried by thousands of people 
over the age of 65 will be increased by an average of 17%, spokeswoman 
Jeannette Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross confirmed the rate increases, which are similar in size to those the 
company implemented last year, after an inquiry from The Times, which was 
prompted by a letter from an Orange County policyholder complaining that his 
rates were going up 32% while his benefits were being reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said Blue Cross, like other health insurers throughout the country, is 
caught in a bind between increases in medical fees and a greater demand for 
ever more complex and costly services, and as a result must charge higher 
premiums while restricting benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Our premiums are based on two factors -- the cost of health care services and 
the usage of health services by subscribers," she explained. "New technology, 
new drugs, new diagnostic tests, new surgical techniques are all driving costs 
up. Many services offered now never existed before. Heart bypasses and other 
advanced procedures are becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the population on the average is aging, requiring more 
health care services. People are going to doctors more and getting more 
treatments. . . . It is not only doctors' fees that are increasing." 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said that among 19 different medical plans covering the 550,000 
policyholders under 65, only one plan, covering a scant 2,000 subscribers, saw 
a decrease in premiums. 
</P>
<P>
But the spokeswoman said that despite the broad increases, Blue Cross still 
feels that if the matter is put in perspective, its health insurance premiums 
are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of Blue Cross coverage, after the latest increases, will be 
$144 per month per household, or $1,728 a year, which is equal to the average 
cost to a patient of $1,800 for just one day in a hospital per year, Hartman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As for benefit restrictions, she said Blue Cross is reducing the amount it will 
pay the minority of its individual policy holders who are still at the 90% 
reimbursement level to 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she said, it has added an incentive for subscribers not required to have 
the approval of Blue Cross before entering a hospital to voluntarily seek such 
approval. In these cases, there will be a $250 additional deductible charged 
when approval is not obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Pychiatric care benefits are also being further restricted. Blue Cross will 
henceforth be paying only $25 per visit for a maximum 20 visits a year. 
Previously it had paid a maximum of $50 a visit for up to 50 visits a year. 
</P>
<P>
For ambulance service, Hartman said Blue Cross is slightly increasing benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said Blue Cross has lost some customers in the last year. Last year, it 
said it had approximately 600,000 subscribers under 65. 
</P>
<P>
The man who wrote The Times, John Meyer of Mission Viejo, said that in his 
case, "They have finally priced me and my family out of health care" and he was 
leaving the plan. He said his family's premiums had gone up 90% in the last 2 
1/2 years.

LUNGREN TO RUN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL; VOWS TO PROSECUTE POLITICAL CORRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Republican Rep. Daniel E. Lungren, promising that he would actively 
prosecute political corruption, announced Wednesday that he will seek his 
party's nomination for attorney general next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of California are calling for integrity and they deserve it," 
Lungren said in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With strong ties to Gov. George Deukmejian and other top GOP officials, the 
42-year-old Lungren is expected to be the only serious Republican candidate for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
He took a special interest in law-and-order matters in Congress, where he was 
instrumental in the passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, 
which revised federal criminal statutes and empowered the government to seize 
property and assets from drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, at a press conference in Los Angeles, said he thought drugs and gangs 
are the public's major concerns. 
</P>
<P>
But he also sought to tap disgust with corruption among officeholders by 
emphasizing that he would take a special interest in that subject if elected 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to a lot of ordinary people before deciding to do this," Lungren 
said, "and they expressed the view that the California attorney general 
shouldn't have to get the U.S. attorney and the FBI do the work." 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to a federal investigation of corruption in the 
Legislature, which recently led to the indictment of state Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya (D-Whittier) and an aide on charges of racketeering, extortion and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren denied that he was criticizing the current attorney general, Democrat 
John K. Van de Kamp, whose office has been under fire by Republicans for not 
taking the lead in investigating state legislators. Van de Kamp is now running 
for governor. 
</P>
<P>
But Lungren's implication seemed unavoidable as he promised to establish an 
"integrity unit" that would make investigation of political corruption a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's not a separate division of the department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren represented parts of Long Beach, Torrance and Orange County for 10 
years in Congress before resigning last year to try to become state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
He was nominated for that job by Gov. George Deukmejian after Democrat Jesse M. 
Unruh died in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Lungren was rejected by the state Senate in a nasty partisan fight and 
former state Auditor General Thomas W. Hayes was eventually confirmed as 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren moved his wife and three children to Roseville, Calif., and went to 
work for the Sacramento law firm of Diepenbrock, Wulff, Plant &amp; Hannegan. 
</P>
<P>
Chief strategists for his race for attorney general will be former Ronald 
Reagan speech writer Kenneth L. Khachigian of San Clemente and Lungren's 
brother, Brian, a Sacramento political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Country Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo 
Smith are seeking the Democratic nomination for attorney general.

CONTACT LENS SELLERS' TALE BRINGS LOBBY DEALINGS INTO SHARPER FOCUS 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a top aide to Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) called the owners of a 
small but burgeoning mail order contact lens business in San Diego last year, 
they were shaken by his news. 
</P>
<P>
An obscure bill, written by the California Optometric Assn., was due for a 
hearing before the Senate Business and Professions Committee, chaired by 
Montoya. If passed, the measure would very likely put the company, Dial A 
Contact Lens Inc., out of business. 
</P>
<P>
With minor variations, the various parties basically give this account: 
</P>
<P>
The Montoya aide, Amiel A. Jaramillo, advised the owners -- a husband-and-wife 
team -- to contact a Sacramento lobbyist, and among those he recommended was 
David Kim. 
</P>
<P>
They did. And what the lobbyist told Dieter and Jamie Hundt shook them even 
more -- and provided a rare, behind-the-scenes insight into how private money 
often determines the course of little-noticed, special-interest legislation in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Kim said, it would cost the couple as much as $25,000 in lobbying 
fees to beat back the optometrists over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so scared," Jamie Hundt said in an interview. "I'll never forget that 
feeling. It was a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Hundt sought advice from her father, Bert Williams, a Texas lawyer and 
former mayor of El Paso. Williams called both aide Jaramillo and lobbyist Kim. 
"I was thrown for a loop," recalled Williams, a veteran of Texas politics. 
"This kind of (putting on the) bite thing is going on too much in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Kim told him it would be a good idea if the Hundts kicked in 
another $20,000 for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Dieter Hundt said that lobbyist Kim told them that the California Optometric 
Assn. was a powerful force in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the association spent $99,000 for lobbying activity last 
year. And since 1985, the organization's political action committee has made 
more than $500,000 in campaign contributions to legislators -- including $9,600 
to Montoya himself. 
</P>
<P>
The optometrists have also proved to be generous with gifts and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, the association gave Montoya four pairs of eyeglasses 
and a set of contact lenses reportedly worth a total of $518. Since 1985, 
Montoya has also reported receiving $5,000 in speaking fees from the group. 
</P>
<P>
Kim has frequently represented special-interest groups before the Montoya 
committee. And one of his clients, Affiliated Podiatrists of California, paid 
Montoya $3,500 in speaking fees in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a formidable opponent, the Hundts agreed to hire Kim five days 
before the bill was to be considered by Montoya's committee. Kim gave them a 
copy of his lobbying contract in an envelope marked with the printed return 
address of chairman Montoya's committee, according to the Hundts. 
</P>
<P>
The company won a brief reprieve: the committee hearing on the bill, sponsored 
by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), was postponed for three weeks. That gave 
the Hundts time to contact their customers for a letter-writing campaign to 
Montoya and other members of the committee. And faced for the first time with 
organized opposition to the bill -- voters who wanted to keep buying their 
contact lenses at a discount from the Hundts -- the committee killed the 
measure in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awaiting Senate Vote 
</P>
<P>
But the battle had just begun over the legislation, which would ban dispensing 
of contact lenses by mail unless the seller personally checks the way the 
lenses fit the eyeball. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a similar measure by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) passed the 
Montoya committee last month and is now awaiting a vote by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
And the Hundts, frustrated and angry that they must court legislators as well 
as customers if their business is to survive, have told their story to the FBI, 
which is continuing its 3 1/2-year investigation of alleged political 
corruption in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that federal probe, both Montoya and aide Jaramillo have been 
indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with 12 counts of violating 
extortion and racketeering laws. 
</P>
<P>
Through their attorneys, both have insisted on their innocence. Neither 
responded to calls for a comment on the contact lens bills. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo's attorney, Christopher H. Wing, said his client was simply doing his 
job by contacting potential opponents of legislation before his boss' 
committee. Wing also accused the Hundts of using the Montoya-Jaramillo 
indictments in an effort to discredit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Hundts agreed to pay Kim only $2,097 for his efforts on their 
behalf -- far less than the $25,000 extended contract he repeatedly asked for. 
</P>
<P>
Kim failed to officially report $1,097 of that fee -- an omission he corrected 
Wednesday, only after he was asked about the payments by a Times reporter. 
California law requires lobbyists to report all their fees to the secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The Hundts learned about the latest version of the optometrists bill late last 
month -- only after the measure passed Montoya's committee on a 6-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour defended his bill as an important consumer protection measure. "I wear 
contact lenses myself," he said. "If they don't fit, they can do real harm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optometrist Agrees 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harry Charm, who is past president of the California Optometric Assn. and 
Seymour's personal optometrist, agrees. "Problems do not always occur with 
early warning signs of pain and discomfort," Charm said. "There is no such 
thing as an absolutely identical contact lens that we can simply hand to a 
patient. The eyes have to be checked." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker denied that his bill would force Dial A Contact out of business: 
"It would require them to change the way they operate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dieter Hundt argues that the lenses he sells are the same as those sold to 
patients by optometrists, at a fraction of the cost. "Once they are fitted and 
seen," Hundt said, "the optometrists should let them go elsewhere for the 
lenses."

GORBACHEV REBUFFS EFFORT TO NAME YELTSIN TO KEY POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, facing his first political rebellion in the 
Soviet Union's new national legislature, rebuffed attempts Wednesday to name 
Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist politician, as the head of the 
government's principal watchdog body. 
</P>
<P>
After more than an hour of very sharp debate, Gorbachev secured the Supreme 
Soviet's confirmation of Gennady V. Kolbin, the Communist Party leader in the 
Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, as chairman of the People's 
Control Commission, which oversees the government's activities and audits its 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
But, for Gorbachev, it was an unexpected challenge in which the central issue 
was not the popularity of Yeltsin nor the qualifications of Kolbin but what 
kind of legislature the new Supreme Soviet will be and what kind of leadership 
Gorbachev will exercise as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Prove More Difficult 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev will be able to have his way -- that was never seriously in doubt -- 
but it could prove difficult and more costly as the deputies insist on the 
independence of the new 542-seat legislature, which was elected from within the 
larger assembly, the Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker after speaker rose to say, "I'm for Yeltsin," and the clamor did not 
diminish even after Gorbachev's announcement that the popular Siberian 
politician, former leader of the Moscow party organization and deputy minister 
of the building industry, would -- by agreement -- instead head a legislative 
commission overseeing capital construction. 
</P>
<P>
Some disputed Kolbin's qualifications for the watchdog role, although he has 
been appointed three times in the last two decades to purge party organizations 
after the dismissal of leaders accused of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the democratic alternative?" one young deputy asked Gorbachev. "To 
prove that this is a real democracy, please offer us an alternative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Same Pattern Appears' 
</P>
<P>
"Consistently, the same pattern appears -- we are approving your appointees, 
but not making the selections ourselves," he added. "In fact, Comrade 
Gorbachev, we are just voting in people you selected and nominated." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, irritated by this and other criticism, replied bluntly: "Under the 
constitution, you can accept or reject my choice. Put me at the starting point, 
and I will think again. But first you must do that." 
</P>
<P>
In a plea to "trust the Supreme Soviet, trust the people," half a dozen 
deputies urged Gorbachev to include both Kolbin and Yeltsin on a secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who expressed their uneasiness with Yeltsin's populist style, 
particularly the large following he has built in Moscow and other major cities, 
said that he should be on the ballot simply so that people would not contend 
that the Establishment is trying methodically to isolate him and exclude him 
from real power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Support 
</P>
<P>
Strong support came, however, from Central Asian deputies who form the 
Congress' conservative wing and who have shown themselves in the Supreme 
Soviet's first meetings to be the group most responsive to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, called upon to save the situation, lumbered up to the rostrum at 
Gorbachev's request. Describing himself and Kolbin as "both comrades and 
friends," Yeltsin said: "I consider that he is a person who, from a political 
viewpoint and from his experience, his businesslike qualities, his adherence to 
principle and his attitude to people, is completely suitable to be entrusted 
with this post." 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a vote, Gorbachev tallied 34 votes against Kolbin, who was the only 
nominee, 53 recorded abstentions and the rest were presumed in favor of his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But probably half of the 542 members, all but about 30 of whom were present, 
appeared to observers in the press balcony and viewers on television not to 
have taken part in the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, attempting to curtail the free-wheeling debate in the Congress, now 
a week beyond its original schedule, later won approval for a timetable that 
would bring the session to a conclusion Friday, with a further session of the 
Supreme Soviet on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With an important four-day trip to West Germany starting Monday, Gorbachev 
clearly hopes that this will prove sufficient excuse to bring the two bodies 
back under at least the restraints of time. 
</P>
<P>
In the first analysis of the composition of the Supreme Soviet, which will be 
the country's permanent legislature but still subject to the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the weekly Moscow News reported on Wednesday that 370 of the 
members in its two chambers were government or party officials, that 99 were 
blue- or white-collar workers or farmers, 68 were highly qualified specialists, 
such as scientists, and five were pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the composition with the last Supreme Soviet, which was effectively 
appointed by the Communist Party rather than elected, the newspaper found that 
the role of the leadership and top and middle echelons of officials has 
declined -- as has that of the workers and farmers. But the share of seats held 
by lower-level officials and the intelligentsia has increased.

NEW PROTESTS ERUPT IN HONG KONG; GOVERNOR FLIES TO LONDON FOR TALKS

Angry residents Wednesday honked horns, planted Nationalist Chinese flags and 
demanded that Chinese leaders resign during spontaneous protests in Hong Kong 
against the military crackdown in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The protests broke out even though organizers canceled planned demonstrations 
for fear of more violence after rioters stormed Chinese banks earlier in the 
day. Police said five officers were injured and 15 protesters arrested. 
</P>
<P>
From dawn until nearly midnight, a stream of protesters converged Wednesday on 
China's official New China News Agency, the mainland government's de facto 
embassy in this British colony. They shouted abuse at the Chinese leadership 
and placed flowers for slain demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no estimate of the number of protesters, who walked six 
abreast and stretched down several streets. 
</P>
<P>
Most wore black or white clothes, traditional Chinese funeral attire, and many 
carried banners denouncing Chinese leaders and praising the pro-democracy 
demonstrators ousted by soldiers from Tian An Men Square in Beijing last 
weekend. Hundreds of people died in the Beijing crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Some groups in Hong Kong had called for a general strike Wednesday, and many 
shops in this bustling British territory were closed. Many displayed 
anti-Communist posters on their shutters. 
</P>
<P>
David Wilson, the colony's governor, left Wednesday night for London to meet 
with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of Parliament to discuss the 
future of Hong Kong, where anxieties about future Chinese rule have increased 
since the Beijing violence. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997, when a 99-year lease expires. 
Some British lawmakers are now demanding that the accord be reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
Organized protests were called off Wednesday after police fired tear gas to 
disperse about 7,000 rioters who hurled rocks and bottles at police in the 
Kowloon section of the colony. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the clashes developed after people drove through the area honking 
their car horns to protest the Chinese military moves and then attacked several 
mainland Chinese banks. 
</P>
<P>
About 98% of Hong Kong's population of 5.7 million are ethnic Chinese, and 
two-thirds of them are refugees from mainland China or their descendants.

CHINESE LEADERS REPORTEDLY FLED TO MILITARY BASE

<P>
On Monday morning, a convoy of 40 limousines and minibuses, guarded by six 
tanks and several more armored personnel carriers, rolled out of the Chinese 
leadership compound at Zhongnanhai in central Beijing and headed west. 
</P>
<P>
Some sketchy details about this convoy were provided in a Communist 
Party-affiliated newspaper here, and brief footage of the convoy appeared on 
Chinese television. 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts here now believe that convoy contained virtually the entire 
top political leadership of China, vacating the complex adjacent to the 
Forbidden City from which the Communist Party has ruled the nation for nearly 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they went to a military compound in the Western Hills outside 
Beijing," said one source here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zhao's 'Limousine Arrest' 
</P>
<P>
Included in the entourage, this source said, were ousted Communist Party 
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili, a member of the Standing Committee 
of the Politburo -- both men brought along under guard in what might be called 
"limousine arrest," a traveling version of house arrest. The two are believed 
to have lost their posts because they opposed the imposition of martial law 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Yang Shangkun and other hard-line leaders took Zhao and Hu 
along "in order to keep an eye on them," said one analyst. 
</P>
<P>
None of these leaders has been seen in public for as long as two weeks and it 
is unknown which of them is ascendant at the moment. In Washington, President 
Bush's spokesman said Wednesday that the Administration remains confused about 
"the structure of the government . . . or who is making decisions." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where they are. We simply surmise that based on historical 
patterns that there have been some of the leaders which have gone to other 
locations within the city or to the outskirts of the city," press secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said. He said U.S. officials have been unable to make contact 
with any "any of the top leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Thus there is considerable speculation now about what is going on inside that 
compound in the Western Hills. 
</P>
<P>
(Western analysts insist they do not know exactly where this military command 
post is located.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Is Boss Now? 
</P>
<P>
Who is the most influential official in the compound? Is Chinese leader Deng 
Xiaoping, unseen since May 16, there? And what persons or units are providing 
security for the leaders during this political crisis? 
</P>
<P>
The question of security -- that is, of who provides protection for the leaders 
-- has proved important in recent Chinese history. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of Mao Tse-tung, a special palace guard unit called the "8341" 
unit helped arrange the arrest of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and other radical 
leaders allied with her. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, there were reports that Premier Li Peng had been shot and 
wounded in the thigh by one of his guards. Western diplomats here have not 
confirmed that the incident took place. But the report serves as a reminder 
that the outcome of the current power struggle could well hinge on who has the 
best and the most loyal security protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Current Palace Guard 
</P>
<P>
The current version of the old 8341 unit, the palace guard for China's 
leadership, is called the Central Guard Unit. It is run by the General Office 
of the Communist Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 until recently, this unit was run by an official named Wen Jiabao, a 
protege of Zhao. Like his mentor, Wen is now believed to be under some form of 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
This guard unit is also supervised by an older, semi-retired military figure 
named Yang Dezhong, who was for years the personal bodyguard to Chinese Premier 
Chou En-lai. 
</P>
<P>
"If Deng Xiaoping is alive and in that complex, he'd go with the old and 
reliable Yang Dezhong for his security," said a Western analyst. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the West knows for certain if Deng is alive -- and if he is, no one 
is too sure whether he is serving as commander, captive or medical patient 
inside the Western Hills compound. For a decade, Deng has been called China's 
"paramount leader," and the common assumption has been that as long as he is 
healthy, he will be the dominant figure in Chinese political life. 
</P>
<P>
But that assumption is now being called into question. Another Western analyst 
interviewed here said he believes that within the command post in the Western 
Hills, President Yang is now a more powerful figure than Deng. 
</P>
<P>
"Yang has more direct control over the military than Deng Xiao-ping does," he 
said. "Over the past two years, Deng has had to drop his own two proteges 
(Communist Party General Secretaries Hu Yaobang and Zhao). That's a sign of 
weakness. In a power struggle, Yang's got more influence in the inner circle 
than Deng." 
</P>
<P>
However, another government analyst here disputed that theory. He said he 
believes Deng is healthy and gave the military orders that led to the massacre 
last weekend in Beijing -- but that Deng has stayed out of sight so that he can 
avoid being blamed for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts here are also trying to figure out whether there is some 
centralized command post for the military units that have been seeking to take 
control of Beijing away from those units that invaded the city last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility is that each of these units is operating independently -- each 
unit motivated by revulsion over the massacre and over the harm it has done to 
the image of the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
The other possibility is that there is a broader factional struggle within the 
Chinese military, and that those units seeking to recapture Beijing are working 
closely together.

BEIJING TROOP MOVES SEEN AS MOSTLY 'JOCKEYING'

<P>
U.S. experts trying to discern the intentions of the massive military units 
moving into place in and around Beijing suspect that rival commanders are 
putting on a show of force to bolster their positions in negotiations over the 
shape of a new government. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the army units are not deployed in conventional battle 
formations but rather are "jockeying and posturing" to signal their presence to 
other forces in the area, analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Troop movements also suggest that senior military commanders may be bringing in 
fresh troops to replace some elements of the 27th Army, the main force that 
carried out the weekend massacre of civilian demonstrators and which is almost 
universally hated by the citizens of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
But officials caution that these theories are drawn from fragmentary evidence 
and the situation could change overnight. "It's like quicksilver," one senior 
Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts are watching the military moves closely because they provide 
virtually the only sign of government activity in the Chinese capital at this 
time. Senior civilian leaders have been out of sight since martial law was 
declared May 20, and U.S. officials say they have few clues on the presumed 
power struggle now occurring in their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are reports that the 27th seemed to be in defensive positions, but 
defensive against what?" asked the Pentagon official, who requested anonymity. 
"You can draw certain conclusions, but they're all speculative. At this point, 
you can't tell from the deployments what their intentions are." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence sources estimate there are as many as 350,000 Chinese troops 
now in and around Beijing from more than half a dozen units based in three 
military regions in eastern China. New forces continued to arrive Wednesday, 
but it was not clear what units they represented or to whom they owed loyalty, 
government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. government source said that troops in the capital are "jittery" 
and discipline is breaking down because of supply shortages and stress on the 
soldiers, who were not trained for urban riot duty. In addition, there is 
confusion among not only the troops but their commanders as to rules of 
engagement -- when they are allowed to fire and at whom. 
</P>
<P>
Paul H. B. Godwin, a specialist in the Chinese military at the Defense 
Department's National War College, said the Chinese leadership is desperately 
seeking a solution to the crisis before the nation collapses in civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"The veteran leaders want to get the hell out of this mess. This is a 
disaster," he said. The only way to resolve the crisis, Godwin suggested, is 
through a negotiated agreement among military and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Godwin theorized that commanders of at least seven major People's Liberation 
Army (PLA) groups have converged on Beijing for a high-level conference with 
senior Communist party leaders, perhaps at a secret and highly secure military 
command post west of the city. They brought large elements of their 
40,000-member armies to Beijing as a poker player puts a stack of chips on the 
table to intimidate other players, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Rear Adm. Robert J. Hanks, who served in the Far East on active duty 
with the Navy, said his reading of the troop deployments around Beijing is that 
elements of the 27th Army are bracing for a possible attack by the 38th Army, 
which refused orders to carry out the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, 
and other units sympathetic to reformist Communist Party General Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, now apparently sidelined for opposing the imposition of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
There have been persistent reports of skirmishes between the 38th and other 
reform-minded army units and the hard-line 27th. However, Hanks said he saw no 
sign of offensive-oriented forces massing outside the city for a major attack 
and that he doubted there would be extensive fighting between elements of the 
PLA. "But there's damn little hard evidence" to assess, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas W. Robinson, director of the China Studies Program at the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington, likened the situation in Beijing to 
"medieval barons drawing up with their troops from the four corners of the 
map." 
</P>
<P>
He said that army commanders are taking the initiative in rebuilding central 
authority out of the current chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to pull the trigger," Robinson said. "The first thing that has to 
be done is to get the army back together. Then the party. Then the government. 
When states fall apart you have to do it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson noted that the likelihood that any of the army units is equipped with 
battlefield or short-range nuclear weapons is remote, even though China has an 
extensive arsenal of nuclear artillery and bombs. Such weapons are not 
routinely issued to field commanders, but rather are kept in secure depots 
until released by senior commanders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Short-range weapons tend to be stored in certain areas and I doubt very much 
whether they've been moved," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that strategic long-range missiles have no use in the current crisis, 
but they are capable of hitting the Soviet Union and the United States, which 
may account in part for the superpowers' muted reaction to Chinese events. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful in this situation that we do not do or imply things 
that would allow some unknown elements in the military or elsewhere to believe 
that we are taking advantage or interfering in internal Chinese affairs. We 
don't want them to literally fly off the handle and push some buttons," he 
said.

COLORADO CHARGES NUCLEAR WEAPONS PLANT ON HEALTH COUNTS; U.S. INQUIRY CONTINUES

<P>
Colorado health officials charged the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant with 25 
violations of state regulations Wednesday and expressed concern over the 
federal government's secrecy surrounding its criminal investigation of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The list of violations uncovered during Health Department inspections begun a 
year ago included leaking drums of hazardous waste, inadequate monitoring of 
ground water contaminants and unauthorized storage of waste. 
</P>
<P>
The department also complained about shoddy records that make it unclear 
"whether they know where their wastes are so they can manage them properly." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly 100 agents from the FBI and the Environmental Protection 
Agency spent a second day seizing documents and taking samples of the air, 
water and soil at the controversial plant northwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor Not Informed 
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department still refused to tell even Colorado Gov. Roy Romer 
and the state's Department of Health exactly what prompted the unprecedented 
probe or what the agents hope to find. 
</P>
<P>
Without those specific allegations, the Health Department said it cannot 
declare with full confidence that there is no threat to public health and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Looby, assistant health director, said the Justice Department "is 
reviewing" a request for details. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Health Department's preliminary order Wednesday that Rocky Flats 
comply with state regulations was independent from the federal investigation 
and that the timing was mere coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Department violations "raise some serious concerns about the ability 
of the Department of Energy and Rockwell International Corp. to manage" the 
facility, Looby said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, is owned by the 
U.S. Department of Energy and is operated by Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
"No individual instance we discovered is a terribly nasty violation," said 
David Shelton, director of the Health Department's hazardous materials and 
waste management division. "But in aggregate, the violations show the facility 
has a great deal of difficulty in managing hazardous waste. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
At Rockwell headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., a statement released Wednesday 
said the company "is confident the Rocky Flats plant . . . has been and is 
being run safely and in compliance with applicable laws." 
</P>
<P>
A videotape message from Henson Moore, assistant secretary of energy, was 
played over closed-circuit televisions to the Colorado facility's 6,000 
employees Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us a rah-rah speech to do our jobs professionally, that our future at 
the plant depends on the kind of job we do in the next 10 days," said a 
chemical operator at the plant who asked not to be identified for fear of 
jeopardizing his job. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the search of the plant by federal agents would take about 10 
days, but the entire investigation could last six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The worker, a 10-year employee at Rocky Flats, dismissed the federal 
investigation as "all for show . . . to finally say to the state: 'We'll do 
something about it, we don't know what, and we'll make it real dramatic so the 
whole state will say Rocky Flats will finally get what they deserve.' " 
</P>
<P>
The worker said employees do not routinely report infractions of plant 
regulations "unless it's a major nuclear thing" because "you don't rat on your 
buddy." 
</P>
<P>
He insisted Rocky Flats is safe, dismissing the investigation as "unfounded 
scare tactics . . . to close the plant." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Energy said last year that Rocky Flats would be closed within 
the next 20 years as part of a plan to consolidate the country's seven nuclear 
weapons facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But both federal authorities and plant spokesmen say Rocky Flats is expected to 
operate as usual while the current federal search warrant is being executed, 
with temporary closures of some sections as needed for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has discussed the investigation only in broad terms, 
saying it focuses on the storage and disposal of hazardous and mixed hazardous 
and radioactive waste, unpermitted treatment of waste, falsification of 
documents and concealing environmental contamination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Federal Laws 
</P>
<P>
The violations would fall under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act, which governs hazardous waste disposal, and federal water pollution 
control and false statement laws. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalties under hazardous waste and clean water laws are 15 years 
imprisonment and $250,000 in personal fines plus $1 million in corporate fines 
for knowingly endangering public welfare. Violating regulations or statutory 
requirements brings a maximum of two years imprisonment and $50,000 in fines 
under the waste disposal act and three years in prison and fines of $50,000 per 
day under the water pollution control law. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the federal search warrant at Rocky Flats did not name any 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Department complaint gives Rocky Flats 10 days to respond to the 
alleged violations. Officials said some of the infractions -- such as the leaky 
storage drums -- were taken care of immediately when health inspectors spotted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Department complaint is a civil, not criminal, action, which could 
eventually result in fines against Rocky Flats if it fails to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) said legislators were told in a briefing 
Tuesday that the investigation was spawned 10 months ago by "whistle blowers." 
</P>
<P>
However, Colorado's FBI agent-in-charge, Bob Pence, said the joint probe by the 
FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency was begun in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Paul Houston in Washington also contributed to this story.

BOTH SIDES TO LOBBY BUSH ON CLEAN AIR BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
President Bush plans to meet today with a who's who of corporate chiefs and 
then with the leaders of major environmental organizations in a last round of 
lobbying before he settles on his proposal for clean air legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings will provide a final opportunity for the two sides to directly 
influence the President on a series of major decisions that have not yet been 
made on the clean air plan, which Bush is expected to announce Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After months of meetings by a sub-Cabinet working group that refined a series 
of options, Bush plans to make the final decisions himself over the weekend, he 
told congressional leaders in a meeting Tuesday. The remaining decisions 
include both broad questions of policy and some fairly small but important 
details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Degree 
</P>
<P>
Bush's aides, for example, have agreed that the Administration should propose a 
broad new effort to switch cars from gasoline to cleaner-burning fuels such as 
alcohol. But Bush must still decide whether the federal government should 
merely encourage such action or order that it be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, to clean up acid rain, lower-level officials have reached agreement 
that the Administration should seek a 10-million-ton reduction in the amount of 
sulfur that power plants, factories and industrial boilers pour into the air 
each year. But they have left to Bush the decision on how quickly that goal 
must be reached and which of several possible means should be used to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's first meeting today will be with an industry coalition that includes 
some of the most prominent figures in American business, including the chief 
executives of General Motors, Amoco, Du Pont and USX. Then, after a speech to 
Ducks Unlimited, a wildlife and hunting organization, Bush will meet with a 
delegation including the leaders of nearly all the major environmental 
organizations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides will concentrate on a similar list of issues. But the industry 
group plans to limit its discussions solely to clean air, while several of the 
environmentalists plan to raise other issues, such as the Alaska oil spill and 
some of the controversial nominees of Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The business leaders are "going to tell him very strongly that there are some 
things we're concerned about" in the plans the Administration is considering, 
said William Fay, director of the industry-backed Clean Air Working Group. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the business group opposes any plan to mandate the use of 
alternative fuels. It argues that the decision should be left up to state and 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
On acid rain, the business group will urge Bush to delay the deadline for 
sulfur reductions until at least 2005. Under the plan recommended to Bush by 
his Domestic Policy Council, the reduction goal would have to be met between 
2000 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want Earlier Deadline 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, meanwhile, would like to see the deadline set earlier, 
sometime during the 1990s, and will tell Bush that the reductions his advisers 
are proposing are too small. While the Administration talks of a 10-million-ton 
reduction, including 1 million tons from cleaning industrial boilers, the 
environmentalists would like a goal of 12 million tons without counting 
reductions from boilers. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists tend to favor mandating the use of alternative fuels but 
also argue that the Administration is emphasizing that course too heavily and 
not pushing enough to clean up existing gasoline-powered engines.

LIGHT TERMS GIVEN TO FIRST TWO CONVICTED IN PENTAGON SCANDAL

Two Teledyne Electronics Inc. executives were given light sentences on 
Wednesday for their part in a scheme to bribe a Navy official to win a 
$24-million electronics contract. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams described George H. Kaub, 50, and 
Eugene R. Sullivan, 57, as "basically gofers" in the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Kaub was sentenced to six months in a halfway house and fined $30,000 for his 
conviction on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and filing false statements. 
Sullivan, convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud, will spend three months in a 
halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were given two years of unsupervised probation and ordered to perform 
300 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Each faced at least 20 years in prison and $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Kaub and Sullivan were the first defendants found guilty at trial in the 
ongoing federal Ill Wind investigation into corruption in the Pentagon 
procurement system. In all, 14 individuals and two corporations have confessed 
to crimes uncovered in the three-year probe. 
</P>
<P>
In handing down the sentences, Williams delivered a blast at the military 
procurement system, which he said was infested with "consultants -- which in my 
view is a euphemism for rogues -- who are permitted to lead a parasitic life 
off the system." 
</P>
<P>
Williams added: "I can't believe our government, the executive and the 
legislature, lets a system like this endure." 
</P>
<P>
Kaub and Sullivan are vice presidents at Teledyne Electronics, a Newbury Park, 
Calif., subsidiary of Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
They were convicted for their parts in a bribery scheme that developed after 
they hired Alexandria, Va., consultant William L. Parkin to help obtain a 
$24-million Navy contract for radar test gear. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin shared his fees with fellow consultant Fred H. Lackner of Woodland 
Hills, Calif., who paid Navy procurement official Stuart E. Berlin for inside 
information. Teledyne's Washington marketing representative, Michael Savaides, 
was also part of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
All have pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges. Teledyne pleaded 
guilty and agreed to pay as much as $8.4 million in fines and reimbursements 
for its role in the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Williams described Teledyne's hiring of the consultants as an "outrageous 
arrangement" that provided $160,000 in fees "to take care of scum like Parkin 
and his playmates." 
</P>
<P>
In giving out the light sentences, Williams noted that Kaub and Sullivan had 
spotless records and were solid citizens in their California communities. He 
criticized their superiors at Teledyne for instructing them to participate in 
the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Kaub, his voice cracking, admitted a "serious error in judgment" and said: 
"This has taught me a very, very bitter and real lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sullivan: "I've learned a very hard lesson."

YOUTH ACCUSED OF ALTERING DRIVER'S LICENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old high school senior from Irvine has been arrested on suspicion of 
doctoring as many as 250 driver's licenses, usually to change birth dates, a 
business that allegedly netted him $1,000 a week, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police estimated that Paul Howard Schwartz had altered the licenses, 
mainly for teen-agers in Orange and Los Angeles counties, since January. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Schwartz altered driver's licenses to specifications for $60 a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"In our undercover operation, we ordered six new IDs from him, telling him that 
they were for a criminal who needed new identification, and he made them for 
us," Sgt. Leo Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Tuesday arrested Schwartz, a University High School senior, on suspicion 
of counterfeiting state documents, a felony. He was released to his parents, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said Wednesday night, "From what I hear, the police's press release 
about this is pretty inflated, but I really don't care to comment." 
</P>
<P>
The youth faces more than 100 felony charges -- one charge "for each fictitious 
license produced," Jones said. State law provides for up to a year in prison 
for each conviction of a charge of "counterfeit of a state seal."

The Israeli army blew up the Gaza Strip home of a family of 13 in a punishment 
staged before foreign journalists to gain maximum publicity. The explosion in 
Beit Lahiya destroyed the modest cinderblock and corrugated-iron home where 
Bassam Makussi lived with his parents, grandmother and nine brothers and 
sisters. Makussi, 19, headed a small group that the army says was responsible 
for half a dozen gasoline bomb attacks against Israeli troops near Gaza. He is 
awaiting trial and has confessed to the attacks, which caused no casualties, 
the army said. Meanwhile, Israeli troops in the occupied territories shot and 
wounded at least seven Arab demonstrators, and the body of a Palestinian 
suspected of collaborating with Israel was discovered in Nablus.

Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos remains in critical condition 
after an operation to drain an abscess on his pancreas. But a hospital 
spokesman in Honolulu said he is making normal progress. Marcos, 71, who has 
suffered heart, lung and kidney problems, underwent the three-hour operation 
Tuesday at St. Francis Medical Center to try to reduce a fever. "Although 
Marcos remains in very critical condition, there are no complications from the 
operation," the spokesman said. Marcos, forced out of Manila and into exile by 
a popular uprising in 1986, has been in the hospital for four months. A U.S. 
government prosecutor said Marcos is too ill to stand trial on charges of 
stealing $109 million from the Philippine treasury and fraudulently borrowing 
$165 million from New York banks.

The Wall Street investment banker who was raped and beaten into a coma when 
jogging in New York's Central Park was transferred to a Connecticut 
rehabilitation center, where she will undergo therapy to help her live 
independently. The 28-year-old woman, whose name has not been released, was 
brought to Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford by ambulance from Metropolitan 
Hospital in Manhattan, where she had been a patient since the April 19 attack. 
"She was admitted to the 16-bed unit for traumatic brain-injured patients and 
will undergo a period of evaluation during which a complete treatment plan will 
be developed," said Lori Ann Brass, the hospital's spokeswoman. The victim had 
been near-dead after being attacked by a roving youth gang on a night of 
"wilding" in the park and was on life-support systems for more than a week.

Michael R. Deland, regional administrator in Boston for the Environmental 
Protection Agency, will be nominated as chairman of the President's Council on 
Environmental Quality, the White House announced. The selection of Deland, a 
47-year-old lawyer who has gained a reputation as a strong enforcer of 
environmental laws, brought praise from several environmental groups. The 
three-member council was established in 1970 to advise the President on 
environmental matters and has few statutory powers. "Mike Deland is a 
first-rate environmentalist, and I think he's an outstanding choice," said Jay 
Hair, head of the National Wildlife Federation.

Pope John Paul II urged world leaders to take advantage of an emerging "moral 
awakening" to jointly combat international problems ranging from drugs and AIDS 
to poverty and pollution. The Pope, speaking to diplomats in Copenhagen on the 
seventh day of his trip to Scandinavia, said the 20th Century has brought war 
and "seemingly intractable sources of suffering," including AIDS (acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome). "Yet many will agree that the world is living 
through a moment of extraordinary awakening," he said. "The old problems remain 
and new ones arise, but there is also a growing awareness of an opportunity 
being offered to give birth to a new and better era." The Pope will leave 
Denmark today for his final stop, Sweden.

Santa Barbara's City Council voted 6 to 0 to reject further city youth program 
contributions from the local Elks Lodge because of the group's recent rejection 
of two black membership applicants. Elks leaders insist the lodge does not 
condone racism and blamed the rejections on a few members, noting that it takes 
only three to turn down an applicant. Woody Wodarczak, the local exalted ruler, 
said the Elks donated $24,000 last year for disabled children.

U.S., SOVIETS TO SIGN ACCORD

<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union are set to sign an accord pledging that 
neither side will resort to force in responding to accidental military 
incidents during troop maneuvers, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. The pact, which does not require Senate ratification, is to be signed by 
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his 
Soviet counterpart, Army Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, in Moscow while Crowe is 
there for an 11-day visit beginning Monday, Fitzwater said. The pact, 
negotiated by a U.S.-Soviet task force over a period of several months, is "not 
intended to augment or substitute any arms control forum," Fitzwater added, but 
is simply "designed to prevent the use of force in responding to accidental 
military incidents."

BERNARDI WIN IS FOR LITTLE PEOPLE, HIS BACKERS SAY

Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro welcomed his victorious 
colleague Ernani Bernardi to the council meeting Wednesday with an admonishment 
to "please get his 'no' button replaced. He will need it for the next four 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, known as a naysayer at City Hall -- particularly on spending issues 
-- handily won Tuesday's runoff election over his challenger, city Fire Capt. 
Lyle Hall, who had more money, a more sophisticated mail campaign and labor 
unions' support that translated into scores of ready volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Bernardi's campaign portray his 55%-45% win as a victory for the 
little people -- the homeowners, horse owners and minority group leaders who 
rallied behind the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as close to grass-roots as it comes. This is as close as it comes to 
the way it used to be," said James Acevedo, one of Bernardi's campaign 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
As an ebullient Bernardi took his seat on the council Wednesday, he was offered 
congratulatory hugs and handshakes from fellow council members, who often 
openly rebuke him for his penny-pinching and unwillingness to play political 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"This really was an affirmation of Ernie's integrity and good record in 
office," said Councilman Joel Wachs, one of Bernardi's few consistent council 
allies. "He does it his own way. He stands for what he believes in." 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that he won. I hate to see an incumbent lose," said Councilman 
Gilbert Lindsay, who has often clashed with Bernardi over downtown 
redevelopment. "He's an honest man who's got some funny ideas. But that's his 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Bernardi brushed aside further kudos to turn his trademark 
outspokenness toward his defeated opponent's campaign, which he branded a 
stream of "irresponsible distortions and lies." 
</P>
<P>
During an impromptu news conference, the 77-year-old Bernardi said Hall did 
himself in with a flurry of slick and biting mailers that attacked his age, his 
absences from the council and his failure to solve the crime, drug and housing 
problems of the East San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
"More people were turned off than anything else by those mailers," Bernardi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi joined other council members and political consultants in suggesting 
that Hall's endorsement by former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., now 
chairman of the state Democratic Party, may have backfired in the nonpartisan 
race. Both Hall and Bernardi are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Brown is not a popular figure," Ferraro said. "People recall what a 
shambles he left the state in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Analysis Cited 
</P>
<P>
Hall and his campaign manager, Harvey Englander, denied that either the mailers 
or the Brown endorsement were to blame for the loss. Yet both said they will 
not know what went wrong until they analyze precinct-by-precinct breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The beaming Bernardi who faced reporters in the council chamber on Wednesday 
was a far different man from the anxious Bernardi of Tuesday night. He 
sequestered himself in a back room of his Sylmar campaign headquarters after 
early returns showed him trailing his opponent by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
Even for a man who relishes a good fight, it had been a very tough campaign. 
The toughest, as he freely admitted, of his 28 years on the council. He had to 
appeal to voters in a virtually new district -- one that was drastically 
redrawn in 1986 -- and he had to best a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
It was a campaign Bernardi did not enter full force until after the April 
primary, so confident was he of an outright win then. It was only after he 
failed to gain more than half of the primary votes that Bernardi hired two 
campaign managers -- one to solicit community support and the other to develop 
a mail campaign -- and started concentrating in earnest on such standard 
campaign fare as fund-raising and public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
During the runoff campaign while Hall was publicizing a bevy of endorsements 
from statewide and national politicians, Bernardi was harvesting local support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Support 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significantly, a number of Latino community, business and 
political leaders gathered to back Bernardi, saying he had been more involved 
with their community than had Hall and that he was, at least, a known quantity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was the first time in the Valley that the Latino leadership has 
jelled and come to the support of any candidate. . . . That's what put him over 
the top," said Al Avila, an aide to Councilman Richard Alatorre and a Sylmar 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
Englander, Hall's campaign manager, was skeptical about the breadth of 
Bernardi's community support. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had all this grass-roots support, why did he hire people the last day?" 
he groused. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's campaign hired youths on Tuesday to pass out leaflets and carry 
placards. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, a 10-point margin is nothing for an incumbent to gloat about, 
especially if he intends to run for reelection. But because Bernardi plans to 
retire after this term and because voter turnout was so low, most political 
observers said it was a healthy win. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who had expected a closer race, said Tuesday night that he would run 
again in four years, but on Wednesday, he added a contingency to that promise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll continue to be involved, and I'll continue to care about the community," 
Hall said. "If things are still the same way in four years as they are today, 
then of course I'll run."

FREEDOM DEFEATS 'ONION FIELD' KILLER AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER and CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Rex Burns received a telephone call Monday night telling him to watch 
the 11 o'clock news: "Onion Field" killer Jimmy Lee Smith had messed up again. 
He was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who had counseled Smith in and out of prison for more than a decade, 
figured from recent conversations that Smith again was using drugs and losing 
his always-minimal enthusiasm for life on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I made a prediction a month ago that he was setting himself up to 
go home, and 'home' to Jimmy is prison," said the minister, an affable, 
street-wise man who first met Smith in the late 1970s while serving as a 
volunteer chaplain at Soledad Prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy's an excellent convict. He's a lousy citizen." 
</P>
<P>
It was fitting that Smith made news this week for what is an everyday crime in 
Los Angeles -- being under the influence of heroin. For all his notoriety, 
there really is nothing special about Jimmy Lee Smith, except the fact that 
Joseph Wambaugh happened to write a chilling book about a cop-killing that 
Smith and Gregory Powell committed in 1963 in an onion field near Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Now 58, Smith is a typical member of a depressingly large class of paroled 
felons who fail to go straight. Sixty percent of them are back in state prison 
within two years of their release, according to a 1987 study of 10,000 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Raised by a great-aunt in Ft. Worth, Tex., during the Depression, Smith moved 
to Los Angeles near Skid Row in the 1940s and quickly became an addict, 
shoplifter and petty thief, spending time in several state prisons. He and 
Powell murdered Los Angeles Policeman Ian Campbell the same year that Smith was 
paroled from Folsom Prison. Wambaugh reported that when an old guard chided 
Smith about returning to the prison, he remarked, "Sir, I was born for Folsom 
Prison." 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Powell both were sentenced to death for Campbell's murder, but as the 
result of a state Supreme Court decision outlawing the death penalty, both men 
had their sentences reduced to life with the possibility for parole after seven 
years. In 1982, at age 51, Smith was paroled -- to great public criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, while Powell remained in prison unsuccessfully applying for parole, 
Smith has been arrested five times and either convicted of crimes or found to 
be in violation of his parole. At least four times he has been sent back to 
prison. In his adult life he has never spent a full year out of custody. 
</P>
<P>
His latest run-in with the law occurred on Monday night when he was arrested by 
West Covina police. A woman claimed that she had been held captive by Smith 
over the weekend and that he had attempted to rape her. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, prosecutors declined to file the attempted rape and assault 
counts, and instead charged Smith only with being under the influence of 
heroin. At his arraignment, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 90 days in 
jail. He could be returned to state prison for as long as a year for violating 
parole; a panel of the state Board of Prison terms will hear the matter within 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now Jaded 
</P>
<P>
Even the patient Rev. Burns, who believed that Smith had made a sincere 
commitment to Christ when he originally was paroled, is now jaded. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a judge and Jimmy came before me today and the prosecutor asked for 
prison for life, I probably would go along with him," Burns said in an 
interview in his Whittier townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had as much and maybe more help than the average convict coming out of 
prison. There has to be a time when you say it's enough," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy," said Karl Hettinger, the former Los Angeles policeman who was 
riding with Officer Campbell when they made a routine traffic stop of Smith and 
Powell in Hollywood, and thus became part of the Onion Field legend. "I still 
get angry. The criminal justice system in California, it really stinks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem With Heroin 
</P>
<P>
Hettinger escaped by bolting away from the killers and running across the onion 
field, where the officers had been taken at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's basic problem has been heroin. Four months after he left Soledad Prison 
in 1982, he failed a test for drug use -- he explained it was because of a pill 
he had taken for a headache -- and left his Los Angeles home in what he 
described as panic. During that period he heard a newscast report there was a 
warrant out for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'What the hell, they are probably going to kill me before they 
arrest me anyway,' " and he made a connection with a heroin dealer in San 
Pedro, Smith testified at a parole revocation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
He was sent back to prison for six months. He came out ("I'm going to try twice 
as hard this time to stay out," he promised a reporter) and lived in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Domestic Problems 
</P>
<P>
According to Burns, Smith was having domestic problems. He had married a woman 
with several children while in prison. As he began his parole, he was working 
in a cabinet shop, but "she kept the pressure on him to make more money," Burns 
said. "The only way he had to do it was selling drugs." A user like Smith was 
not capable of selling without using, the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
After his first parole-revocation sentence, Smith stayed straight for eight 
months before he flunked one of the twice-a-month drug tests required of 
"high-risk" parolees. Marv Holmes, his parole officer at the time, said he 
noticed fresh needle marks on Smith's arms. Another parole violation, another 
trip back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, shortly after Smith returned from his second parole-violation 
sentence, Burns set up a breakfast meeting for Smith with a friend of Burns who 
was looking for a house painter. According to police, Smith brought something 
else to the appointment: a few grams of heroin that he tried to sell outside 
the restaurant to an undercover cop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Most Intelligent' 
</P>
<P>
"Jim's not the most intelligent man in the world," Burns said sympathetically. 
</P>
<P>
The judge who sentenced Smith to five years in prison for the drug arrest 
complained, "Every time he's gotten out, he's become involved in some illegal 
activity and been incarcerated again." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's wife divorced him while he was in prison, according to Burns. He was 
released in November, 1986, after serving two years and four months. Four 
months later his parole was revoked for another six months because he changed 
his residence without notifying authorities and was caught with a small knife. 
A few months after he served that sentence, his parole was revoked for a year 
for driving without a license, being under the influence of a drug, possession 
of heroin and possession of drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Loser' 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who as Los Angeles County district 
attorney in 1982 tried unsuccessfully to block Smith's original parole, was 
asked Wednesday by a reporter for an assessment of Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a loser. . . . You could have predicted this. . . . This is a guy who 
should be just locked up and kept there," Van de Kamp said, repeating the 
public pronouncements he has issued each time Smith has gone afoul. 
</P>
<P>
That, Burns said, was part of Smith's problem -- the constant public attention. 
</P>
<P>
"The public's opinion was that he was a loser, he was always going to be a 
loser. We tried to talk him out of listening to what people were saying. We 
tried to talk him out of giving interviews," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was, media attention seemed to somehow validate Smith's existence. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy was always proud of his notoriety," Burns said. "He wasn't pleased with 
the ("Onion Field") crime, but this was the only time in his life he was 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needed Help 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Burns moved to Whittier from Monterey. In November, he received a 
phone call from Smith, who had recently been released from prison. For once, 
Burns said, Smith was acknowledging that he'd weakened himself too drastically 
on heroin and needed help. Burns arraigned for him to check into a Christian 
rehabilitation center in South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
By now Burns had concluded that Smith's once-professed Christianity was at best 
"shallow." But the Rev. Richard Matas of the New Jerusalem Church in East Los 
Angeles, which sponsors the rehabilitation center, described Smith as a 
peaceful man with deep respect for the church. 
</P>
<P>
Matas said Smith went from periods of deep depression to times when he eagerly 
vowed to make a new start. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very emotional," Matas said. "I would see him up on the altar praying, 
'Lord, take me home.' I don't think he was talking about prison; I think he was 
just tired of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Matas said he believed that drugs were a haven for Smith during the bad times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Way of Escape' 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a way of escape for him," he said. "Some of these guys, they're not 
strong enough and this is their escape. These men are scarred up and hurting 
and there's no help. The church can only do so much." 
</P>
<P>
Smith could at times be an inspiration to other parolees, Matas said. 
</P>
<P>
"That man helps people," he said. "He gives advice and things like that. I 
heard him tell some guys that prison was no good. . . . He just got turned the 
wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
From last fall until early spring, Burns and his wife saw Smith at least every 
week, often more frequently. Burns believed that Smith was holding his own "as 
long as he attended the church services" at the rehabilitation home. 
</P>
<P>
About a month and a half ago Burns recommended Smith to an acquaintance named 
Omar Haddad, who was fixing up and reselling homes. Burns told Haddad that 
Smith was a convicted felon but did not tell him he was an "Onion Field" 
killer. Smith painted, replaced glass and fixed doors for several weeks at a 
home on Cherrywood Street, sleeping there at nights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complainant in Jail 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a woman with whom he was working, Vicki Louise Ashby, 36, complained 
to police that Smith held her against her will over the weekend and beat her 
while making sexual advances. However, prosecutors in the district attorney's 
sex crimes division said Wednesday that those allegations could not be proven. 
Authorities also put Ashby in jail, saying she was wanted for arrest on 
warrants charging her with battery, possession of amphetamines and probation 
violation in connection with a forgery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Smith appeared haggard and sullen Wednesday during his arraignment. He answered 
"yes" when the judge asked if he wanted a court-appointed attorney, then 
pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor heroin offense. 
</P>
<P>
And then, once again, Jimmy Lee Smith was led away to jail.

THE CITY ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS GIVE A LESSON IN POWER AT THE POLLS 
</P>

<P>
Overnight, the balance of power in the nation's second-largest school district 
may have shifted dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Tuesday's runoff election, the Los Angeles teachers union, which 
two weeks ago was locked in a bitter strike against the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, has won what appears to be a sympathetic majority on the Board 
of Education. And teachers suddenly face the heady prospect of wielding new 
influence over how the sprawling district -- with about 600 schools and nearly 
600,000 students -- is run. 
</P>
<P>
The change on the seven-member board also raises questions about the future of 
district Supt. Leonard Britton, who was the target of brutal union criticism 
over the last few months. Britton is due to come under review by the board 
before his contract expires next June, although the board could renew his 
contract before its membership changes in July. 
</P>
<P>
Despite near-record low turnout at the polls, United Teachers-Los Angeles -- 
the union representing most of the district's 32,000 teachers -- successfully 
turned out voters to reelect West San Fernando Valley board member Julie 
Korenstein and to secure challenger Mark Slavkin's victory over Westside 
incumbent Alan Gershman. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is you better listen to us or you are in political trouble," UTLA 
President Wayne Johnson said Wednesday. "We defeated John Greenwood two years 
ago; we defeated Gershman now. The political strength of teachers cannot be 
underestimated." 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin is expected to join board members Korenstein, Warren Furutani and 
Jackie Goldberg to form a majority supportive of teacher demands. Gershman, 
along with Leticia Quezada and Rita Walters, opposed teacher salary demands 
that sparked the teachers strike that paralyzed the district for nine days in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution on Board Lineup 
</P>
<P>
But Slavkin, cautioning against predictions about the new board lineup, said 
Wednesday that "it's inaccurate to think that the four of us will line up on 
issues across the board. . . . There are issues where I will differ with the 
UTLA." 
</P>
<P>
And despite Johnson's brash warnings, he said he is not completely convinced 
that teachers have won control of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"The joke is that you better get all you can from UTLA candidates right away 
because they're only good for six months," Johnson said. "We helped elect Alan 
Gershman, Rita Walters, Jackie Goldberg, Warren Furutani and Julie Korenstein 
-- that's five board members -- and we still had a nasty strike." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, who has been at times supported and at times strongly criticized by 
the UTLA, said it is nearly impossible to achieve unanimity among board members 
because "there are too many things in teaching that teachers themselves can't 
agree on." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Johnson and the UTLA clearly expect the union's election efforts to 
yield greater influence over board policy. For example, the union is expected 
to have an impact this summer when the board will make final a plan to share 
school decision-making powers among teachers, parents and principals. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, Johnson and UTLA members say that their influence over board 
elections cannot be denied. More than 100 teacher volunteers walked precincts 
and telephoned voters in both the West Valley and Westside. With the help of 
thousands of teacher donations, Korenstein raised and spent about $200,000 
since the campaign started in January, while Slavkin raised nearly $150,000 the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
Junior high school Principal Gerald E. Horowitz, who lost to Korenstein in a 
bitter runoff, charged that the UTLA bought the election. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Nelson, Horowitz's campaign consultant, said Korenstein raised three 
times as much money as Horowitz because of her union support. "This was 
probably the most blatant example you can see of special interests funding a 
campaign," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gershman has filed complaints with the state's Fair Political Practices 
Commission that the UTLA has exceeded campaign spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein was forced into a runoff after falling 57 votes short of the 
50%-plus-one-vote majority needed to win in April. Gershman had received about 
48% of the April 11 vote, compared to 36% for Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, despite being an incumbent, had been considered vulnerable to 
defeat. Her stance on some issues had angered several parents' groups since her 
election to the board in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On the Westside, union support helped elect Slavkin -- a 27-year-old aide to 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman and a political unknown -- in his 
first bid at public office. 
</P>
<P>
Gershman staunchly opposed making deep cuts in the district budget in order to 
finance a raise in teachers' salaries, and he did not go along with the 
contract settlement calling for a 24% pay increase over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Korenstein, who talked frequently with the media and appeared on 
television several times during the strike, Gershman said almost nothing about 
the negotiations until a settlement was reached May 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to play catch-up," Gershman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in two community college board runoffs Tuesday, the faculty union 
scored one win and one loss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College Counselor Wins 
</P>
<P>
In the election for Office No. 6, the American Federation of Teachers College 
Guild, which represents instructors and clerical employees of the Los Angeles 
Community College District, backed union activist and college counselor Althea 
Baker. Baker said Wednesday that she attributed her victory in large part to 
strong support from district faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent, Los Angeles Trade-Technical College English instructor Patricia 
Hollingsworth, said she lost because she could not spend as much as Baker on 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty union spent $100,000 during the primary and runoff campaigns on 
behalf of Baker and the candidate it endorsed in the other race, Rose Ochi, 
union campaign analyst Art Forcier said. 
</P>
<P>
But the backing of the teachers' guild failed to secure a victory for Ochi, 
whose loss to Los Angeles Trade-Technical College auto shop teacher Pat Owen 
for trustee Office No. 2 surprised some political analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Ochi, an attorney and aide to Mayor Tom Bradley as head of the city's criminal 
justice planning office, outspent Owens by 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Some speculated that Ochi was hurt by her identification on the ballot as an 
attorney and mayoral aide. They said that many voters distrust lawyers and that 
Bradley's recent problems as the subject of investigations into his personal 
finances probably cost his aide some votes. 
</P>
<P>
Owens was not available for comment, but his campaign manager, Dan Carasso 
said: "The Bradley factor had to be weighed in, in all candor." 
</P>
<P>
Ochi said Wednesday that she was "disappointed" by her loss and felt that the 
low voter turnout contributed to her defeat.

HUGE CRANE FALLS AT HIGH-RISE SITE BUT NO ONE IS HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A massive crane collapsed atop a high-rise building under construction in 
Century City Wednesday morning, leaving an 80-foot boom balancing precariously 
on the skeleton of the 28th floor and sending the crane's hook plummeted more 
than 200 feet to the street below. 
</P>
<P>
Although dozens of construction personnel were working throughout the partially 
completed building and on the ground below, there were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking out the window when I noticed that the crane was swinging very 
fast," said Brian Campbell, a 34-year-old office broker who works in another 
high-rise across the street from the building being erected at 1999 Avenue of 
the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, part of it collapsed, and it came crashing down through the decking 
they're putting in on the top," Campbell said. "The workmen up there scattered 
like ants as the thing came down. The boom was left hanging. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Plumber Michael Sennett, 31, who had been installing toilet fixtures on the 
seventh floor of the building, said the impact of the falling crane "felt like 
an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
The crane consists of a vertical mast beam, much like the mast of a ship, with 
a horizontal boom suspended from it, much like a ship's boom. Officers of 
Dinwiddie Construction Co., which is erecting the building, said the crane was 
not carrying a load when the boom snapped near the point where it joins the 
mast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Moments Earlier 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the crane had been used moments earlier to haul half a dozen 
20-foot steel beams up to the construction crew, which is building the top 
floors of what eventually will be a 38-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the crane works from the ground, following the hand signals of 
workmen perched at the edge of the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and police units responded quickly to the accident at 10:53 a.m., 
barricading the streets below while construction crews and firefighters atop 
the structure worked to secure the dangling boom. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Fire Department nor the construction company had a damage estimate.

A man who killed himself after shooting a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department civilian employee during a struggle in a Woodland Hills parking lot 
had attempted to steal a car from a nearby dealership shortly before the 
confrontation, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they believe that Anthony Rotella, 21, may have seen Zalai 
Tibor, 30, running from the Ventura Boulevard car lot or committing another 
crime early Tuesday morning and approached him in the Taft High School parking 
lot to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Rotella, a community services officer, was shot twice in the head after 
struggling with Tibor. He remained in critical but stable condition Wednesday 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. Detectives have been unable to question 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was witnessed by two California Highway Patrol officers who 
happened by the parking lot. One officer shot and wounded Tibor, a Hungarian 
immigrant who lived in North Hollywood. He then fled to a nearby office 
building and shot himself to death.

PALTRY TURNOUT SENDS ANALYSTS SEARCHING FOR CAUSES AND CURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles voters avoided, if barely, setting a record for low turnout in 
Tuesday's election, but the dismal showing has set minds to work on the causes 
and potential solutions of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials say voters were turned off by ethics controversies. Political 
scientists say we have too many elections for too many minor offices. 
</P>
<P>
And a small group of political observers ventured that maybe it is all right 
after all that most of us ignore minor races such as the one on Tuesday's 
ballot for the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel hard pressed to vote for community college board," said Raymond E. 
Wolfinger, professor of political science at UC Berkeley, and he suggested that 
most Californians are no different. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city clerk's office, turnout in the community college 
districts was 9% and in the city proper 10.9% -- largely thanks to a 
comparatively strong 20% turnout in the 7th Council District. The record low, 
set in 1983, is 8.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's poor showing follows on the heels of a record low turnout April 11 
for the mayoral primary election. In that contest -- in which nearly half of 
the City Council was elected in addition to the mayor -- only 24.33% of 
registered voters went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons for poor turnout -- such as apathy, poor education and the 
increasingly mobile and rootless nature of society -- seem insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
But potential solutions, such as eliminating some elections and elected 
positions, are just as provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians themselves say the reasons for low voter participation -- and the 
solutions to the problem -- are political in nature. 
</P>
<P>
They say voters perceive their problems as so large that no candidate appears 
capable of providing solutions. "If no one has an answer (to society's 
problems), how do you make a choice?" said Bob Naylor, former state Republican 
Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians say low voter turnout is the result of a homogenization of 
ideology, a blurring of the distinctions between candidates, and that makes 
choices more difficult. Naylor, paraphrasing former President Ronald Reagan, 
said candidates for public office need to abandon the "politics of pastels" and 
"stand for something clear." Only then will voters respond, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Over Turnout 
</P>
<P>
Many in the political process are concerned about slipping voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
One strategy City Councilman Richard Alatorre is exploring is consolidation of 
municipal elections with county and state elections. That would not only 
combine high-visibility contests and the lesser offices on the same ballot but 
would reduce the number of times voters go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfinger points out that city residents have been asked to go to the polls 
three times in the past seven months. "Let's face it," he said, "when you keep 
doing it, people lose interest." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at Caltech, said other partial 
solutions are to adopt more accessible vote-by-mail programs and make voter 
registration easier by making it part of automobile registration. Only about 
70% of eligible voters actually register, according to several studies. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez said the idea of consolidating elections 
"always comes up, but never seriously." 
</P>
<P>
And he is not convinced that it would really make that much difference. 
Martinez said there is a large "drop-off" on long ballots. Although many voters 
will cast a ballot for President or governor at the top of a ballot, they will 
pass over lesser offices such as judges at the bottom of the ballot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez said new technology is making other alternatives, such as voting 
by telephone or post card, possible, even if they will take a while to be 
accepted. Even though many Americans do not take advantage of voting, "people 
want confidence in the system," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
VOTER TURNOUT 
</P>
<P>
Turnout in Tuesday's Los Angeles general municipal election was the second 
lowest in at least 20 years, the city clerk's office records showed: 
</P>
<P>
1969: 62% 
</P>
<P>
1971: 45% 
</P>
<P>
1973: 64% 
</P>
<P>
1975: 43% 
</P>
<P>
1977: 29%

BIG SPIN WINNER WINS AGAIN AS $3.4-MILLION AWARD STANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Doris Barnett came up a winner again Wednesday when a Los Angeles judge 
rejected an attempt by the California Lottery to upset a jury's $3.4-million 
award to the 54-year-old Big Spin contestant, but her legal battle for the 
money seems far from over. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after Superior Court Judge Robert B. Lopez denied a motion 
for a retrial, lottery officials said they will appeal the judge's decision to 
a higher court, probably sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We truly wish that Ms. Barnett's spin could have won her $3 million," said 
spokesman John Schade. "But if we don't consistently enforce the rules 
governing each spin, we undermine the integrity of the game and then everyone 
loses." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who had greeted the judge's decision with smiles and thanks to the 
Lord, said in a later phone interview that she is now "angry" and "disgusted" 
with lottery officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they're wrong," she said. "I really feel angry now, but I'm not 
crying. . . . I'm going to hang in there to the last, until they give me my 
money. I'm going to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
Her legal battle could take months or even years, according to her lawyers, 
Lawrence J. Sperber and David B. Shapiro, who were successful in convincing a 
jury in April that Barnett is entitled to $3 million she apparently won, then 
lost, three years ago in the lottery's televised Big Spin. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors also decided that the licensed vocational nurse from Los Angeles is 
entitled to $400,000 in damages because of the emotional trauma she suffered 
when Big Spin television host Geoff Edwards first declared her a big winner, 
then told her she had won only $10,000 because the spin ball had not stayed in 
the $3-million slot for five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Sperber and Shapiro argued that lottery officials had rarely 
abided by their own rules in waiting for the timer's verification before 
announcing a winner. In some cases, they said, a winner has been declared 
before the wheel stopped spinning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Trial Denied 
</P>
<P>
Sperber later likened the state's position to that of a traffic control officer 
who waves motorists through a red light, then tries to ticket one of them for 
doing what he approved. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials tried to upset the jury's verdict in Barnett's favor by 
calling for a new trial. When that failed, they said they would appeal the 
decision to the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the jury's decision in this case allowed this player (Barnett) 
to be excluded from very specific rules and regulations that have been adhered 
to by more than 2,100 Big Spin contestants," lottery spokesman Schade said. 
</P>
<P>
Sperber indicated after Wednesday's ruling that there is room for compromise 
between lottery officials and his client, who he said has undergone a 
"tremendous amount of emotional upset on this lottery roller coaster." 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody with authority from the lottery would contact me, we would be 
willing to negotiate a reasonable compromise, based upon the award of the jury 
and now the ruling of Judge Lopez that there was nothing wrong with the trial 
and the award," Sperber said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the phone from Atlantic City, N.J., where a casino-hotel had given him an 
award, trainer Laz Barrera sounded upbeat for a change. 
</P>
<P>
This has not been one of Barrera's better years. His malaise is not related to 
losing races, or even to the vexing problems of his favorite baseball team, the 
New York Yankees, who are playing at a sub-.500 level and who committed six 
errors the other night. 
</P>
<P>
These are mere trivialities contrasted to what struck Barrera and his son, 
Albert, a few months ago. Just days apart, they were notified by California 
racing authorities that horses they ran had tested positive for cocaine in 
postrace samplings. 
</P>
<P>
The Barreras and some other trainers twisted in the wind before the state, in a 
development as bizarre as the accusations themselves, dropped the cases last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera's hearing had been scheduled for this week, but now the 65-year-old 
trainer has the opportunity to talk about Affirmed, the brilliant chestnut colt 
who became the 11th and most recent horse to sweep the Triple Crown, in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, another California-based colt, can become the 12th Triple Crown 
champion by winning the Belmont Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the Triple Crown, Affirmed outfinished Alydar in all three races as 
they established the benchmark by which all great equine rivalries have since 
been measured. Affirmed beat the late-running Alydar by 1 1/2 lengths in the 
Derby and by a neck in the Preakness. In the Belmont, after the horses had 
battled head to head for the last mile of the 1 1/2-mile race, Affirmed and 
jockey Steve Cauthen, who had recently turned 18, prevailed by a head at the 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Preakness -- in which Sunday Silence dueled the length of the 
Pimlico stretch with Easy Goer before winning by a nose -- is being compared to 
the 1978 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
There are other comparisons being made with the 1978 Triple Crown, because Easy 
Goer is a look-alike son of Alydar and could match his sire's unwanted record 
of finishing second in all three races. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as Affirmed and Alydar all over again at all," Barrera said 
the other day. "My horse and Alydar raced against each other all those times 
when they were 2-year-olds, and we beat him most of the time. These two horses 
didn't start running against each other until the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, with both horses stabled in New York, Affirmed won four of six races 
against Alydar. After the Triple Crown, their only other race together resulted 
in a bittersweet win for Alydar, on a foul in the Travers at Saratoga, which 
left Affirmed with an edge of 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Affirmed had run 15 times by the time he reached the Belmont, and the Belmont 
was Alydar's 17th race. Saturday will be the ninth start for Sunday Silence and 
the 12th race for Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
"Affirmed had lost about 100 pounds by the time we got to the Belmont," Barrera 
said. "We just kept him in light training leading up to the race." 
</P>
<P>
When Affirmed won the Belmont, the racing world might have been getting jaded 
about Triple Crown champions. After Citation had won the three races in 1948, 
there was a gap of 25 years before Secretariat swept the series in 1973, and 
then Seattle Slew in 1977 and Affirmed became the only consecutive winners of 
the crown. 
</P>
<P>
"Affirmed was out of gas by the time he got to the Belmont," said Billy Turner, 
who trained Seattle Slew. "He looked like he'd run 1,000 races. But Alydar was 
just as bad because he had run most of the same races. In the Belmont, those 
two old veterans just leaned on each other all through the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Sunday Silence can replace Affirmed as the most recent winner of the 
Triple Crown, Barrera said: "He's got a big chance. I talked to (trainer) 
Charlie Whittingham the other day, and he said that his horse has been doing 
wonderfully since he got to New York. He's already beaten the other horse 
twice, and that last race -- the Preakness -- was a big race for Sunday 
Silence." 
</P>
<P>
By now, the Alydar-Easy Goer connection is wearing thin with Shug McGaughey, 
Easy Goer's trainer. But Whittingham likes the comparison to the 1978 Triple 
Crown. "Affirmed and Alydar suits me fine," Whittingham said. "As long as I've 
got Affirmed." 
</P>
<P>
The Triple Crown has been doubly kind to Barrera. In 1976, he won the Kentucky 
Derby and the Belmont with Bold Forbes. In the Preakness, Bold Forbes led for 
three-quarters of a mile while running unrealistically fast fractions, then was 
run down by Elecutionist in the stretch and finished third, beaten by four 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Barrera believes that the three-race grind over five weeks is too much 
to ask of a young horse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the distances, it's the weights the horses are asked to carry," he 
said. "They pack 126 pounds in all three races, and that's a punishing weight 
for a horse who might not even be technically 3 years old yet. The weight is a 
crime, because nobody benefits from it. They should make the weight 120 pounds 
-- 115 pounds for fillies -- and it wouldn't be as hard on the horses. The 
jockeys can make that kind of weight. If they can't, they don't belong in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he doesn't have to prove his innocence over the cocaine matter, 
Barrera still feels that he was humiliated by the charges. His horse that 
allegedly tested positive was Endow, a grandson of Exclusive Native, the sire 
of Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have conducted the investigation before they announced our names," 
Barrera said. "How many trainers would have the money to defend themselves if 
their names were involved in something like this? I feel like it's over, but it 
won't ever really go away." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Scattered showers might continue here today and Friday. Sunday Silence can 
handle an off track -- as he did in winning the Kentucky Derby -- but Easy Goer 
dislikes mud. Trainer Shug McGaughey said that he would probably still run Easy 
Goer if there's an off track Saturday. . . . McGaughey's wife, Mary Jane, gave 
birth to their second child -- both sons -- last Friday. The boy, delivered by 
Caesarean section, has been named John Reeve McGaughey. . . . Pat Valenzuela, 
who will ride Sunday Silence in the Belmont, arrived at the track Tuesday and

CHANG IS UP TO OLD TRICKS IN FRENCH WIN

Rain, cold and Michael Chang continued to dominate the French Open Wednesday, 
and if that's not yet as certain a proposition as death and taxes, Chang 
probably is working on it. 
</P>
<P>
The 16,000 bundled-up fans who came Wednesday to Stade Roland Garros found 
center court a perfect place to catch both pneumonia and a precocious 
17-year-old from Placentia who performs magic tricks with his racket. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's next act will be in the French semifinals, where no male of his tender 
age has been before. In fact, Chang is the youngest male Grand Slam 
semifinalist in 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
So, the eyes of the tennis world are trained on his shock of black hair, and 
next door, the trees in the Bois de Boulogne park are fairly shaking with 
anticipation. The pressure must be killing him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah, not really," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't that much that gets to Chang these days. He beat Ronald Agenor of 
Haiti, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), in a quarterfinal match sandwiched around a 
45-minute rain delay and littered with eight service breaks in the last set. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mats Wilander's defense of his French Open title ended where Andrei 
Chesnokov's two-fisted backhands began. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov routed Wilander, 6-4, 6-0, 7-5, and became the first Soviet player 
since 1972 to reach the semifinal round, where he will play Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised," Chesnokov said. 
</P>
<P>
Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I play so well and beat Mats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, who gathered himself in the third set to take leads of 4-1 and 5-2, 
was serving for the third set at 5-3 and had a 40-0 lead, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander changed tactics by attacking the net. But given a target he liked, 
Chesnokov produced a series of winners on unerring passing shots to finish 
strongly. 
</P>
<P>
"He did play very well," Wilander said. "But I did nothing with my shots, and 
everything he did hurt me. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased with the way I played, but I can't be pleased with losing in the 
quarterfinals of the French," he said. "That's not being fair to me." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's match began in the gloom and ended in sunshine. It lasted 3 hours 10 
minutes and was over at 3:10 p.m. Was this some kind of message or what? 
</P>
<P>
Chang won in his newly evolving fashion: Worry about muscle cramps, lose the 
second set, con the other guy into a double fault and play the big points 
slightly better. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Chang was worried that he might be overcome by cramps again, as he 
was in his victory over Lendl. He wasn't, but Chang was still worried, even 
after he had won the first set. "My muscles were very tight," he said. "I had 
that in mind . . . You have that fear of cramping. But as soon as the rain 
came, I talked to my mom, and she said, 'The Lord will take care of you.' That 
took the pressure off a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Agenor applied his own pressure in the second set, busily attacking Chang's 
backhand with deep, powerful ground strokes. Agenor closed out the second set 
and led, 3-1, in the third, with Chang apparently reeling, when the rain began 
to fall. "Before the rain delay, he was very tired," Agenor said. "Then he was 
able to rest and he was in good shape at the end." 
</P>
<P>
After 45 minutes and one false start that was again sabotaged by rain, the 
green tarpaulin was removed a second time, and the players at last returned to 
the court to finish the match. 
</P>
<P>
Chang had resolved to move his feet more and become more active. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, whatever happens, happens," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
What happened is that Chang immediately fell behind, 4-1, although that was 
only one service break. Thirty minutes later, he was serving for the set, which 
he won, but not without a glitch. 
</P>
<P>
Chang double-faulted at 40-15, then put away a forehand volley cross-court 
winner to go up, two sets to one. 
</P>
<P>
A clay-court specialist from Port-au-Prince, Agenor reached the round of 16 at 
both the French Open and the U.S. Open last year with his baseline game. He is 
fluent in five languages, but in the fourth set against Chang, Agenor couldn't 
say much about his serve. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Chang's serve wasn't any better. 
</P>
<P>
Chang broke Agenor in the first game, and Agenor broke back in the second game. 
Chang held serve to 3-3, which was followed by six consecutive service breaks. 
Chang coaxed Agenor into a break in the ninth game. 
</P>
<P>
At 4-4 and 15-40, Agenor got ready to hit his second serve, and Chang moved up 
to a position just behind the service line, the Lendl position. It is where 
Chang coaxed Lendl into a double-fault on match point Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It worked against Agenor, too. Agenor double-faulted, giving Chang a chance to 
serve for the match. Afterward, Agenor admitted that he had been bothered. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a mental attack," Agenor said. "It is an intelligent move, and Chang is 
an intelligent player, but he will not win Roland Garros that way." 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he wasn't trying to insult Agenor with the tactic. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are in a situation where you are desperate to win a point, you do 
anything to bother the concentration of your opponent," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
That must have sounded fair to Agenor. With Chang serving, 5-4, 30-15, Agenor 
moved way up before the second serve. Chang waited for the noise of the crowd 
to subside and got his serve in but lost the point. Agenor broke him when Chang 
hit a forehand approach long. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's error was the first of a number of crucial mistakes by either player. 
Agenor lost his serve at love on four consecutive unforced errors, so Chang got 
another chance to serve for the match at 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Agenor faced match point at 40-30 but lobbed over Chang's head. When Chang 
banged an easy forehand into the net, Agenor had dodged another match point and 
he eventually forced a tiebreaker when Chang committed three consecutive 
unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
"He missed two match balls, but I saved one and he gave me the other," Agenor 
said. "But I was never really in control." 
</P>
<P>
Chang ran off 3-1 and 5-3 leads in the tiebreaker, but Agenor's drop volley 
winner, popped long by Chang, tied it. When Chang netted a forehand, he 
trailed, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Agenor hit a backhand from the baseline, but the ball stopped in the net. Chang 
moved to his third match point on a crisp forehand volley and cashed it in, 
finally, when he hit a backhand down the line and Agenor returned it into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Grand Slam, and we were playing on center court," Chang said. "You 
are faced with a situation where, if you make the shot, it's all over, but if 
you miss, the match could turn around and come back to haunt you." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Psych-out, Part II: Michael Chang said that his tactic of standing right behind 
the service line on second serves started when he was playing in junior 
tournaments. "I would always play guys that were older than me," he said. "They 
would see this little squirt across the net and they would get a little nervous 
because of my position behind the service box. It gives the opponent a 
different perspective and makes him think twice -- hopefully." . . . Ronald 
Agenor wasn't totally convinced that Chang's leg muscles cramped against Ivan 
Lendl. "I cannot make a positive statement, but it is surprising what he did, 
or else he has extraordinary physical condition. Or else he was hiding the way 
things really stood." . . . The previous youngest male player to reach a Grand 
Slam semifinal was Vivian McGrath, an Australian, who did it in the 1933 
Australian Championships at 16 years 11 months.

BAD BOYS HAVE RUSTY, WORN MOTOR HUMMING

DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a tough city, with tough people. It has been called Motor City, and it 
has been called Murder City, but no one has ever dared call it a pretty city. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one of the popular T-shirts in town proclaims: "Detroit. No place for 
wimps." So it's no wonder that the Detroit Pistons, the Bad Boys of the 
National Basketball Assn. and the final opponent of the Lakers in their quest 
for their third consecutive NBA championship, have taken this blue-collar city 
by storm. 
</P>
<P>
In every other city in the league, the Pistons, beaten by the Lakers for the 
title last year, are known as cheap-shot artists who bully their way to 
victory. But here, in this gritty factory town, fans don't want the good guys 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of like that bad image," Piston fan Leonard Foster said. "It's like it 
is us against the world." 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with a plush new arena in Auburn Hills, about 30 miles from Detroit, 
and the best regular-season record in the NBA this year, the Pistons have 
become the hottest ticket in town. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, there is no hoping about it, they are going all the way" said 
Patricia Jordan, a downtown salesclerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen it like this," said James Stewart, a waiter at the Lindell 
AC, downtown Detroit's premier sports bar. "People are at a fever pitch." This 
season, the team became the first Detroit sports franchise to sell out each of 
its home games. And for the second consecutive year, the Pistons drew more than 
a million in attendance. No other NBA team has done that. 
</P>
<P>
The new arena, the Palace, has been a boon to the Pistons. It is only a 
fraction of the size of their previous home, the Silverdome in Pontiac, which 
is slightly closer to Detroit but was hardly suited to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The cavernous Silverdome was built for the Detroit Lions and seats about 75,000 
for football. The Pistons used only 22,363 of those seats, leaving lots of 
wide-open spaces. And at the Silverdome, the Pistons frequently discounted 
tickets to pull in more fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Palace, designed specifically for basketball and developed and owned by 
Piston owner William Davidson, seats slightly more than 21,000, and there has 
been no need to discount tickets. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, prices here are approaching those at the Forum. Before the series 
began, scalpers were asking $200 to $400 for average seats, with seats near the 
floor reportedly going for as much as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
But other entrepreneurs are trying to cash in on the Pistons, as well. The Bad 
Boys image has been turned into a lucrative marketing tool. Bad Boys T-shirts, 
hats and handkerchiefs are on sale throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The two Bad Boys with the worst reputations, center Bill Laimbeer and forward 
Rick Mahorn, are quietly using their negative image to become the two good guys 
in charity work. 
</P>
<P>
They bought the rights to a photograph in Rolling Stone magazine that showed 
them in leather and sunglasses, with Mahorn chomping on a basket and Laimbeer 
crushing a ball. They have turned it into a poster, which sells for $5 a copy, 
and are donating the proceeds to charity. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in town is happy about the Pistons' success since their move 
to Auburn Hills. Some black leaders were angered by the Pistons' move even 
farther from the city, and in March, the Rev. James Holley criticized the team 
for playing "plantation basketball," with "black people performing for the 
amusement of upscale whites." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons denied Holley's charges, noting that the team hasn't played in the 
city since leaving for the Silverdome before the 1978-79 season. 
</P>
<P>
Although the team's leading black players dismissed Holley's charges, some fans 
in the city -- both black and white -- agree that the Pistons have become a 
team for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll find that a lot of people in Detroit haven't been out to Auburn Hills," 
said Eddie Mata at the Lindell AC. "It's out there in the boondocks, and it's 
just too hard to get to from the city. I think 95% of the people who go are 
suburbanites." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, nobody's quibbling. For the rest of the series at least, 
city-dwellers and suburbanites, blacks and whites, are ecstatic that the Bad 
Boys are in the neighborhood.

NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN A MASSACRE CAN BE INSPIRING

<P>
The sun came up Wednesday in transplanted Lakerland after all, no sure thing 
the night before, bringing along a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
There are precedents for openers such as the Lakers' 109-97 loss to Detroit in 
Game 1 of the NBA Finals, a game the Pistons led by as many as 20 points in the 
third quarter. There is that moment in Laker history, the Memorial Day 
Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
On May 27, 1985, the Celtics opened the NBA Finals by winning at Boston, 
148-114. That remains the all-time low point for a Laker defense in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Piston Coach Chuck Daly knows the rest of the story. The Lakers came back to 
win the series,4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I made them aware of it," Daly said of his players, who have every reason to 
be feeling confident heading into Game 2 tonight. "Also, last year we won Game 
1 (at the Forum), and they came back." 
</P>
<P>
Daly wasted little time in using the Memorial Day Massacre as a history lesson 
for the Pistons, reminding them of the game -- and the end result -- in the 
locker room immediately after Game 1. They took good notes. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we should keep an even keel," Detroit forward Dennis Rodman said. "He 
said we should remember what happened a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Said center Bill Laimbeer: "We're very aware of that. We're very aware that our 
bubble can burst with Game 2." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, however, dismiss most comparisons to 1985, even if they're pushing 
for the same result. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to use examples from different years," Michael Cooper said. "But let's 
hope it turns out the same way." 
</P>
<P>
A kiss is still a kiss, Part II: Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas exchanged 
pregame pecks on the cheek in Game 1, as the longtime friends did last season. 
But now, with Mark Aguirre having joined Thomas on the Pistons, through a trade 
with Dallas Feb. 15, it's beginning to look like a love-in before each game, 
the Laker guard kissing his two close friends shortly before tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their business," Laimbeer said. "But if I had a very good friend, I'd 
probably just shake his hand." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Rick Mahorn prefers the same lips-off approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said, shaking his head. "I might catch something." 
</P>
<P>
Is there anyone he would like to kiss anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Mahorn said, "the Laker Girls." 
</P>
<P>
They may consider themselves warned. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983-84 Boston Celtics were the only team to have won an NBA title after 
being swept by their championship-round opponent, the Lakers, during the 
regular season. The Lakers lost both regular-season games to the Pistons this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott was reduced to the role of bystander again at practice Wednesday 
because of the torn left hamstring that will keep him out of Game 2 and 
probably the rest of the series. Tuesday night, he sat on the bench in street 
clothes as the Lakers struggled to replace his outside scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably one of the toughest things I've ever had to do, sit there and 
watch my teammates play without me and see some situations where I could help 
out," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had that type of emptiness in me, ever since I started playing this 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Assault and battery are in the eye of the beholder: All this time people 
thought the Pistons played rough, true to their image as the Bad Boys of 
basketball. Turns out, they're more like a bad rash. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't play dirty basketball," Laimbeer said with a straight face. "Other 
teams just have an adverse reaction to our physical play." 
</P>
<P>
Add Good Boys: Mahorn and Laker A.C. Green were called for offsetting technical 
fouls, which bring with them small fines, for throwing elbows during the first 
quarter of Game 1. At least, that's what the officials called. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't throw elbows," Mahorn said in a comment that is sure to bring a few 
chuckles around the league. "I never have. I just play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I don't remember what happened, other than I had $100 
taken out of my pocket." 
</P>

Steve Garvey, the former baseball star, is becoming a radio talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, 41, said Wednesday that he has signed a multi-year contract as host of 
a morning program for XTRA radio, owned by Noble Broadcast Group here. 
</P>
<P>
The "XTRA Morning Update with Garvey and Co." will start June 26, running from 
5:30 to 9 a.m. It will include interviews with celebrities, calls from 
listeners, news and sports. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, a 10-time All-Star first baseman who played for the Dodgers and the San 
Diego Padres, also has a marketing and investment company and has expressed 
interest in pursuing a political career. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he was in the news when his former fiancee and another woman 
claimed they had been made pregnant by him. The allegations surfaced shortly 
after Garvey had broken off his engagement and married another woman, Candace 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey has said he will take financial responsibility for the children if they 
are proven to be his.

Eric Wedge and Ricky Kimball each spent 56 minutes trying not to think about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
When Wednesday night's College World Series game between Wichita State and 
Florida State was suspended by rain in the eighth inning with the score 3-3, 
Wedge was at the plate for Wichita State with the bases loaded and Kimball was 
on the mound for the top-seeded Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go in there (the dugout) and have a brainstorm too much," Wedge said. 
"I just wanted to hit the first good pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Once play resumed, Wedge jumped on Kimball's second offering for a two-run 
single that keyed Wichita State's 7-4 victory before a crowd of 11,561 at 
Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to sitting around and thinking about it," Kimball said of the delay. 
"and you go over every pitch in the book." 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State's victory avenged a 4-2 loss to Florida State in a second-round 
game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (54-17) and Wichita State (66-15) will meet again Friday to 
decide the East Division representative for Saturday's national-championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Texas (53-17), which is unbeaten in the tournament, faces once-beaten Louisiana 
State (55-16) tonight in a West Division game. 
</P>
<P>
Wedge, who was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the third round of the draft, 
drove in four runs Wednesday. He drove in a first-inning run with a groundout 
to second base and had a run-scoring double in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Dreifort put the Shockers ahead, 3-0, in the fourth when he walked, stole 
second, moved to third on a throwing error by Florida State catcher Pedro 
Grifol and scored on a wild pitch by Florida State starter Gar Finnvold (10-4). 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gilliland started Florida State's scoring in the fifth, coming home from 
third on a fielding error by Wichita State shortstop Pat Meares on a ground 
ball hit by Rocky Rau. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles tied the score with a two-run sixth inning keyed by Buddy Cribb's 
run-scoring double and Gilliland's sacrifice fly to center field that scored 
Cribb from third. 
</P>
<P>
Following Wedge's single off Kimball in the eighth, Wichita State scored its 
final runs on fly balls by Meares and Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitcher Jeff Bluma (3-0) earned the win while Jim Newlin pitched the 
final two innings to record his nation-leading 18th save. 
</P>
<P>
Wedge's double against Florida State gives Wichita State 199 doubles for the 
season, tying the Shockers' own NCAA record set in1985. 
</P>
<P>
Newlin's save against Florida State was his third of the tournament, which ties 
a World Series record. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's West Division game between Texas and LSU features a matchup between 
two of the best college pitchers in the nation.

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: SOUTHLAND'S TRACK DOMINANCE CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The dominance of Los Angeles City and Southern Section athletes was illustrated 
in last weekend's State high school track and field meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes from these two sections won 18 of the 31 boys' and girls' events, and 
finished second in 13. In team competition, Southland teams Hawthorne and 
Dorsey went 1-2 in the boys' competition, and winner Pasadena Muir finished 
just ahead of Oxnard Rio Mesa in the girls' competition. 
</P>
<P>
With his most recent title, Hawthorne Coach Kye Courtney tied the state 
coaching record for team championships with seven, and moved into the top spot 
in the boys'-only category with his sixth title. 
</P>
<P>
And Courtney has a strong group of runners returning, among them three from the 
record-breaking 400-meter relay team. The Cougars ran a state-record 40.24 
seconds in a preliminary heat Friday night but finished second in the final, 
then were disqualified for an illegal baton pass. 
</P>
<P>
The leadoff runner, junior Chris Alexander, who also plays tailback on the 
football team, finished fifth in the 100 meters, running 10.68, and also was 
impressive on the 1,600-meter relay team, which also finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Multi-talented junior Anthony Smith, who ran the second leg of the 400, 
finished fifth in the long jump, with a leap of 23 feet 11 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' third runner, sophomore Erik Allen, was the surprise of the 
season, finishing fourth in the 200 meters in 21.53. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news for Courtney is that anchor Curtis Conway is graduating. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, who will be at USC on a football scholarship in the fall, has been a 
mainstay for the Cougars since his freshman year, reaching the state meet each 
season. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Conway finished his prep career by running personal bests in every 
event he competed in. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the 100 meters, Conway had to recover from a slow start and catch 
Barry Smith of San Francisco Mission, who had set a state record in his heat 
Friday. The victory was Conway's first individual state title and his time of 
10.42, just missed Smith's record of 10.41. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real emotional after that race, probably the most I have ever been," 
Conway said. "I knew it was my last high school 100 meters and that I had 
finally achieved what I had been working for all of these years." 
</P>
<P>
In the 200 meters, another slow start cost Conway, and he finished second to 
Smith, who ran the second-fastest time in the country this season, 20.89. 
</P>
<P>
Conway also ran impressive legs on the Cougars' two losing relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
In the 400-meter relay, his come-from-behind anchor run that almost caught 
winner Long Beach Poly and Andre Green, went to waste because of the 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
And in Conway's last high school running event, the anchor leg of the 
1,600-meter relay, he could not catch Dorsey's Beno Bryant, his former Junior 
All-American football teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant ran a smart race in protecting Dorsey's 10-meter lead, making Conway run 
hard to close the gap to four meters and then pulling away in the last 100 
meters. For Bryant, the City 400-meter record-holder, the victory finished a 
perfect night. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a groin pull, which prevented him from running on the Dons' third-place 
400-meter relay team, Bryant won the individual 400 meters in 47.52 and was 
timed at 46.3 on the anchor leg of the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Muir Coach Jim Brownfield also has a young but 
experienced team returning. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Mustangs figures to be junior sensation Inger Miller, 
who finished second to Rio Mesa senior Angela Burnham, the two-time defending 
state sprint champion, in the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also anchored both senior-less relay teams, which won the 400 and 
finished second in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Also returning will be sophomore Taminika Terry, who contributed with a 
fifth-place finish in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be several individual state champions returning at other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica won the 100-meter low hurdles with a 
wind-aided time of 13.69. She also finished sixth in the 100 meters in 12.04. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Kim Toney of Atascadero won the 800-meter title, defeating defending 
champion Kathi Roldan of Visalia Mt. Whitney, with a time of 2:09.33, second 
best in the country this season. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore jumper Juliana Yendork of Walnut won both the long and triple jumps, 
with leaps of 20-2 1/2 and 41-10, respectively. In the preliminaries Friday, 
she went 42-6 3/4 in the triple jump, which made her the third-best prep 
performer on record. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Twila Sims of Lompoc gave a preview of her potential in the 300-meter 
low hurdles, winning in a national-best time of 42.54. It was the fastest time 
ever run by a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
In the City baseball finals last Thursday night at Dodger Stadium, Kennedy of 
Granada Hills kept alive the San Fernando Valley's streak of 4-A Division 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's 4-3 victory over Palisades, gave the Valley its 17th consecutive City 
title. Most of the players on either team were not even born when Venice, the 
last non-Valley winner, won the title in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A Division, Franklin defeated Bell, 3-2, in eight innings, thanks to 
its football team. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin baseball Coach Rick Campbell credited the seven players who had played 
on the Panthers' football team for his team's winning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"They played on this year's undefeated regular-season football team and on both 
City championship teams," Campbell said. "They just know what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Other Southland state track and field champions: Mark Wilson of Covina Charter 
Oak, who won the high jump with a leap of 7 feet; Angela Rolfe of Dorsey, who 
won her third consecutive 400-meter title in the country's fastest time this 
season, 53.97, and Rayna Cervantes of Montebello, who won the 3,200 meters in 
10:32.95.

B OF A WILL LEND $50 MILLION TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bank of America said Wednesday that it will lend at least $50 million a year to 
developers who build affordable housing for low-income families throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The commitment by the San Francisco-based bank follows nearly a year of 
discussions with community organizations led by an ad hoc coalition called the 
California Reinvestment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
B of A will provide loans for construction, acquisition and intermediate-term 
financing to housing developers who will be selected by working with community 
organizations. The bank said loan terms will be negotiated individually and 
that some are expected to be made at below-market rates. The bank also said it 
will consider reducing fees in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Eligible projects will include multifamily facilities, mobile homes and 
single-family homes. The bank said a significant amount of the money will go to 
projects for individuals and families with incomes at 50% or less of their 
area's median income. 
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said most of the money is expected to go to nonprofit 
developers, although he said other builders will not be excluded. He said the 
bank has no estimate of how many units will be financed with the $50 million 
because the mix of projects has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Donald A. Mullane, a B of A executive vice president, said the program marks 
the first time the bank has announced a specific target amount for direct 
lending to affordable-housing projects. He said loans will start at $250,000 
but that the bank will aim for larger projects because they produce more units 
of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Baldwin, director of the Orange County Community Housing Corp., a 
nonprofit developer, was unimpressed by the B of A announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate is the key," he said. "I don't know of a nonprofit in the 
state that can't get conventional market-rate financing. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is below-market rates and reduced fees that make the homes affordable. 
They are not really doing anything if they are not loaning that money at below 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin's organization builds rental units and is developing a 28-unit project 
in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
But Sylvia Martinez of the California Reinvestment Committee praised the bank's 
decision and said it sets a standard for the financial community. "What is 
notable about this commitment is that the Bank of America views itself in 
partnership with the community," she said. "It has been very difficult to get 
conventional financing for affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
The Greenlining Coalition, which represents 18 minority, consumer and civil 
rights groups, said it is not satisfied with the scope of the B of A plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to bank executives Wednesday, the organization called on the 
state's biggest bank to allocate more money for affordable-housing loans and to 
take steps to loan more money to inner-city minorities, to promote women and 
members of minorities, and to expand charitable donations to the poor and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The demands from the coalition, which has been talking with B of A executives 
for several months, parallel an agreement reached last year with Union Bank to 
expand lending programs for low-income families and to promote more minority 
workers and women. The Union Bank agreement came at a time when the bank was 
being acquired by California First Bank.

THE BIDDING FOR TIME; 
</P>
<P>
SHARES OF TIME SPURT $44 AS SIDES WEIGH OPTIONS, BEGIN LEGAL SKIRMISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trading of Time Inc. shares exploded Wednesday, soaring $44 a share on news 
that Paramount Communications Inc. had launched its hostile $10.7-billion offer 
for the stellar media company that had intended to merge with Warner 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Time and Warner remained silent throughout the day, although the initial shock 
of the unfriendly bid from a "sister" media and entertainment company appeared 
to be wearing off. Time and Warner officials met with their advisers and 
considered their options, which appear myriad if less desirable than their 
original plan to merge in a tax-free exchange of shares. 
</P>
<P>
Time, for example, could launch its own bid for either Warner or Paramount, or 
even attempt to go private. Warner has a similar borrowing power and could 
become the suitor for Time or Paramount, or go private. But all of those 
options require a massive assumption of debt, which will depress earnings and 
leave some shareholders irate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All 3 Reported in Play 
</P>
<P>
For the near term, Time and Warner appeared determined to sit tight, engaging 
in legal skirmishes in Delaware and New York. Warner filed a lawsuit late 
Wednesday against Citibank, which has promised to help raise as much as $14 
billion for Paramount's takeover effort, while in Delaware, Paramount sued both 
Warner and Time to forestall the triggering of certain defense mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, however, professional Wall Street traders declared all three 
of the New York-based companies "in play." The situation has created a field 
day for speculators, who see no way Time and Warner can proceed with their 
stock-swap deal in the face of Paramount's cash offer to pay $175 for each 
share of Time, which closed at $170 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe Warner is in play," said one securities analyst who spoke on 
condition that he not be identified. By doing the Time-Warner deal in the first 
place, the analyst said, "the management of both companies have indicated that 
they're nervous or afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts agreed that Warner has become more vulnerable since it 
recently relinquished its hold on its largest and most truculent shareholder, 
Chris-Craft Industries -- owner of about 19% of Warner on a fully diluted 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
To smooth the way for the Time-Warner merger, Warner agreed to give up its 
rights of first refusal to buy Chris-Craft's holdings if Chris-Craft should 
decide to sell its stake. Warner also agreed to dispose of its 42.5% stake in a 
Chris-Craft broadcasting subsidiary. The settlement liberated Warner from a 
potential Chris-Craft challenge to its merger with Time on grounds that Warner 
would have been in violation of federal cross-ownership rules if it owned both 
TV stations and cable systems in the same markets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5.7 million shares of Time changed hands Wednesday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Warner saw nearly 7.1 million shares change hands, or nearly 4% 
of its capitalization, while Paramount saw nearly 6.1 million shares traded, or 
5% of its total shares. The day's trading in all three stocks exceeded $1.5 
billion in value. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the frenzy is the possibility that another bid for Time may emerge 
since the "breakup" value of the media company has been put at between $180 and 
$220 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood entrepreneur A. Jerrold Perenchio and cable TV pioneer Charles F. 
Dolan have been trying to enlist a deep-pocketed investor such as another 
studio, while a group led by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass appears to still 
hold a sizable block of Time stock. 
</P>
<P>
Although one source said the Bass group tried unsuccessfully to team with 
Paramount more than a month ago to launch the takeover bid for Time, there were 
indications Wednesday that Bass now would consider only a "white-knight" role, 
similar to the one played by Bass and his brothers in 1984 when the Walt Disney 
Co. fended off two hostile takeover bids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basses Seek Bargains 
</P>
<P>
The Basses have a reputation for seeking bargains and typically have not 
engaged in auction bidding, which is where Time appears to be heading, 
explained one entertainment industry source. 
</P>
<P>
Others, on the sidelines, are trying to fathom just what role -- if any -- they 
might play. "The thing that you have to worry about in these things is that you 
don't get shot," declared one entertainment company chief, who also remarked on 
the number of top investment and legal firms engaged in the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Time's investment bank advisers are Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. and the 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit of American Express Co. It has retained the 
law firms of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher 
&amp; Flom. 
</P>
<P>
Warner's investment bankers are Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and Alpine Capital, and 
its law firms are Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison and Wachtell, 
Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, which changed its name this week from Gulf &amp; Western Inc., has 
retained Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. as its investment banker and Simpson Thatcher 
&amp; Bartlett as its legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
All are based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount wasted no time Wednesday suing Time and Warner in Delaware Chancery 
Court to halt an exchange of stock that might make the Paramount takeover bid 
prohibitively expensive. Paramount also challenged Time's so-called "poison 
pill" plan and asked the court to rule that Paramount's offer to acquire Time 
does not constitute an unlawful interference with Time's contract with Warner. 
The judge delayed hearing the case until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, meanwhile, Warner sued Citibank seeking $1 billion in damages and 
an injunction barring the bank from providing financing to Paramount. In its 
suit filed in the state's Supreme Court, Warner alleged that it asked Citibank 
on March 4 to agree not to participate in an unsolicited or hostile tender 
offer for Time or Warner, in exchange for Warner promising to "continue its 
banking relationship with Citibank." 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Citibank agreed and said in writing on March 8 that 
it would refrain from such action for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 90-day agreement appears to have expired on June 6 -- the very day 
Paramount announced its bid -- Warner attacked the integrity of the bank's 
dealings by alleging that Citibank's "discussions and negotiations took place 
within the 90-day period." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach a Citibank spokesman late Wednesday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Time shares closed just $5 shy of Paramount's bidding price. One trader 
suggested the market hesitated to go higher because investors fear Time really 
will proceed with a tender offer for all or part of Warner, with a resulting 
tumble in he value of Time shares. 
</P>
<P>
Speculators also may be hesitating to drive the price higher because any new 
deal for Time likely would require three or four months to secure regulatory 
approvals from federal and local governments, as the Time-Warner deal recently 
demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
There were hints Wednesday that Warner and Time will take their battle to 
Washington to protest the sale of yet another American corporation through the 
assumption of debt that might -- despite Paramount's protests to the contrary 
-- require sale of some assets. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the very politicians who supported the Time-Warner deal may have 
trouble opposing Paramount if it argues that it can keep Time's assets intact. 
In an interview late last week, for example, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said 
he supported Time-Warner because the deal would not likely result in massive 
layoffs in Southern California and the combined company would continue to be 
managed by executives from the entertainment and media fields. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, when asked how he would view a bid from an entertainment conglomerate 
other than Warner, replied: "That's a different situation." The senator was not 
immediately available for comment Wednesday.

Truckers Oppose Rate Change: California's $2-billion trucking industry is 
opposed to a proposed change in intrastate hauling rates. State Public 
Utilities Commission Administrative Law Judge Stan Ferraro proposed new 
regulations that would allow truckers to lower rates without state approval. 
However, truckers would need PUC clearance to raise rates more than 10% under 
the proposal. Trucking industry spokesmen said rates would drop below cost 
under the proposed regulation, which the PUC is expected to consider next 
month.

Hiring Increases Planned: More than a third of West Coast hiring executives 
surveyed recently said they plan to expand their middle-management and 
professional staffs in the next six months. Half said they plan to maintain 
their current staff size. The results were part of a nationwide poll by 
Management Recruiters International, the nation's largest search firm. 
Nationwide, 39.1% of the hiring officers said they planned to expand their 
staffs, compared to 37.4% on the West Coast. David Reiss, head of Management 
Recruiters in Beverly Hills, said the region was slightly behind the national 
average because of a big increase in hiring last year.

Hershey to Build Factory: Hershey Foods Corp. will build a $100-million 
chocolate factory near its existing plant in Hershey, Pa. Ground-breaking is 
set for late this summer for the 130-square-foot plant, which will process 
chocolate for the company's main factory. The new plant will house about 60 new 
employees. Start-up will mean a reduction of employees at the main factory as 
new machinery replaces older, less efficient equipment, the company said. 
Hershey Foods President Kenneth Wolfe said it was not yet known how many 
employees at the main plant will be affected, but he said the company will try 
to ease job reductions through retraining and attrition.

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber said Wednesday that it is withdrawing from South 
Africa, partly because U.S. sanctions against the racially segregated country 
have made it hard to do business. 
</P>
<P>
"While we will regret leaving South Africa after providing jobs and livelihood 
there for 42 years, it is becoming increasingly difficult for American 
companies to obtain adequate returns on investments there," said Tom H. 
Barrett, chairman, president and chief executive of Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
Goodyear is selling its tire and general products subsidiary in Uitenhage to 
Consol Ltd. for $65 million, the South African company said. Goodyear did not 
specify the terms. 
</P>
<P>
Consol is an industrial subsidiary of the South African financial, industrial 
and mining group Anglovall Ltd. The sale is subject to various governmental 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Dun &amp; Bradstreet announced that it had completed the 
divestiture of its remaining operations in South Africa, a medical publishing 
operation that has been sold to Times Media of South Africa and a marketing 
group that was sold to a group of managers who formerly owned it. Sales prices 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions that hurt Goodyear included a double U.S. tax on South 
African earnings, Barrett said. Besides the sanctions, Goodyear's profit 
suffered from continued devaluation of South Africa's currency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Sharp, president of the 2,500-member Akron branch of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, said he hoped that other companies 
followed Goodyear in pulling out of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Goodyear has shown leadership in taking that stand. We appreciate it, 
and we'll be letting them know that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Perduyn, a spokesman at Goodyear's Akron headquarters, said the sale would 
end Goodyear's involvement in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Goodyear described Anglovall as "a responsible group that has demonstrated 
concern for human rights in the workplace and has expressed intent to retain 
the current work force of 2,400 people," most of whom are nonwhite.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: MARKET FOR MS-DOS IS HERE TO STAY

The future of personal computing is a subject very much on the minds of many 
business executives these days, as the choices of available equipment seem to 
grow more bewildering. On one hand, high-performance personal computers are 
becoming more capable -- and more expensive -- at a dizzying pace. But on the 
other hand, sales of basic computers are stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer and one of its major West Coast retailers, PacTel InfoSystems, 
are trying to capitalize on the confusion by sponsoring a series of 
presentations to potential customers by a respected analyst, William J. Higgs. 
He is the vice president of software research for InfoCorp, a personal 
computing market research firm in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Higgs doesn't actually recommend that corporations buy Apple's Macintosh 
computer. After all, InfoCorp has a number of computer manufacturers as 
clients, including IBM, AT&amp;T, Digital Equipment, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
Still, by the time Higgs has finished his two-hour talk, one can understand why 
Apple is willing to pay for the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
A two-minute summary of Higgs' message goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
IBM and Apple started from opposite perspectives of personal computing but they 
now are "marching very much to the same drummer." 
</P>
<P>
Although IBM saw its PC as an appendage to its mainframes while Apple saw the 
Macintosh as an extension of the individual user, both now offer machines with 
similar functions, Higgs said. 
</P>
<P>
Their high-performance computers are able to run several programs 
simultaneously, a feature known as multitasking. They employ graphics to help 
users operate the computer. And they have an internal design that lets several 
microprocessors -- the brains of the computer -- coexist and automatically 
share the computing workload. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's new OfficeVision software extends the graphic user interface -- the 
feature that lets you manipulate pictures on the screen to control the computer 
-- to its entire line of computers from micros to mainframes. It is similar to 
the way Macintosh computers work. (Macintosh and IBM or IBM compatible 
computers cannot run the same software, but they can be set up to share data 
and text files.) 
</P>
<P>
Higgs argues that the Macintosh offers more compatibility throughout its 
computer line than do the IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers. The 
reason: Apple chose to base its machines on Motorola microprocessors and 
created operating system software that would run on all models of the 
Macintosh, Higgs explained. (Apple's new operating system 7.0, due next year, 
will require twice as much memory as available on the basic Macintosh Plus, 
however.) 
</P>
<P>
IBM chose Intel microprocessors and has changed from the DOS operating system 
to OS/2 to get full performance out of its more powerful computers. Programs 
written for OS/2 won't run on lower-performance DOS machines, and DOS programs 
don't tap the power of OS/2 computers. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the IBM world is the new internal design the company adopted in 
1987, called "micro channel architecture," which makes the new hardware 
incompatible with the earlier machines. Many IBM-compatible computer 
manufacturers, meanwhile, have designed a different internal structure for 
their high-performance computers that makes them compatible with the old IBM 
models but not the new ones. 
</P>
<P>
To get the best performance out of any of the new-generation hardware and 
software -- IBM, Apple or others -- you need more processing speed, more 
operating memory and extra hard disk storage than users have been accustomed 
to. And that, Higgs noted, means extra costs. 
</P>
<P>
What Apple undoubtedly likes about his presentation are the cost comparisons 
showing that as performance needs increase, IBM is more and more expensive 
compared to Macintosh -- contrary to what many people think. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing what would be a high-end OS/2 system with a high-end Macintosh 
system, Higgs projected a nearly $5,000 difference in favor of the Macintosh. 
Equivalent performance between the two brands would be achieved, he said, with 
an IBM PS/2 Model 70 with eight megabytes of random access memory, a math 
co-processor and an 80-megabyte hard disk at about $13,000, compared to a 
Macintosh IIx, with four megabytes of memory and an 80-megabyte hard disk for 
about $8,000. The Macintosh has math co-processing built in and has equivalent 
performance with half as much operating memory because of differences in the 
operating systems, Higgs said. But even with identical memory, the Mac still 
would be substantially cheaper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a provocative message, but there was no way to tell how many in the the 
group I sat with were persuaded to abandon IBM for Apple. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I was convinced in quite a different direction -- that DOS computing 
is thriving and will continue for a long, long time. Maybe for most of us there 
is no need to spend the price of a small car for a desktop computer just yet. 
</P>
<P>
Higgs said both IBM and Apple are losing market share in terms of units sold 
with IBM's share "at an all-time low." (Dollar share hasn't slipped as much 
because the high-performance computers from both makers are expensive.) 
</P>
<P>
What most buyers are getting are computers compatible with the older IBM PC/XT 
and PC/AT designs. About 30 million such computers now exist, according to 
InfoCorp's research. 
</P>
<P>
Higgs said DOS will continue to outsell OS/2 as the operating system of choice 
for IBM and compatible computers until at least 1994, because OS/2 requires 
such a powerful and fully equipped computer for acceptable performance. 
InfoCorp recommends seven megabytes of random access memory for computers using 
IBM's Extended Edition version of OS/2 with the Presentation Manager operating 
environment. The research firm's parent organization, Gartner Group, which is 
focused on mainframe computing, recommends a 10-megabyte minimum. 
</P>
<P>
InfoCorp projects a resurgence in DOS sales in the mid-1990s, when it expects 
that the cost of a complete PC system with a hard disk, monitor and printer 
will fall below $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers show that DOS is where the biggest software market lies. The 
machines are there just waiting for better programs to take advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
By better, I mean more efficient, easier to use and more powerful software. 
</P>
<P>
That means limiting on-screen graphics for the most part, because graphics 
really soak up processing speed, memory and hard disk space. 
</P>
<P>
It is probably too much to hope that the emergence of operational consistency 
among DOS programs -- the greatest advantage Macintosh offers -- but 
easy-to-use software is available. A couple of programs that illustrate my 
point are SuperCalc 5, a powerful new spreadsheet from Computer Associates, and 
Advanced Revelation from Revelation Technologies, which is an impressive 
database package. Both are notable because they are easy to use and run easily 
within the 640-kilobyte constraint of DOS, without suffering limits on 
performance or features. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that software developers won't abandon the DOS world to write 
exclusively for OS/2 or the Macintosh. There is a lot yet to do and more money 
to be made in that old-fashioned world where most personal computer users live 
and work.

SWISS SAY KHASHOGGI WILL FIGHT EXTRADITION

<TEXT>
<P>
Saudi Arabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi has decided to fight extradition to 
the United States, where he is wanted on charges of racketeering, Swiss 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, a key middleman in the Iran arms-Contra aid scandal during the 
Reagan Administration, was arrested April 18 at the request of American 
officials and has since occupied a small cell in Bern's district prison. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time billionaire was indicted in March in New York on charges of 
fronting in illegal real estate deals for former Philippines President 
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Present Arguments 
</P>
<P>
The United States had 60 days to formally request extradition and the demand 
arrived May 31 -- two weeks before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, reportedly in financial difficulties after amassing enormous wealth 
through arms deals and other transactions, could have gone at any time to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said he chose to fight the U.S. demand. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's federal police had to make sure the request was "sufficiently 
documented and therefore receivable," Swiss justice department spokesman Joerg 
Kistler said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the case, and Mr. Khashoggi and his lawyers will now present their 
arguments against extradition," Kistler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those arguments will be considered together with the case put by the American 
authorities. It will take several weeks before there is a ruling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi has the right to appeal if the Federal Criminal Police rule that the 
U.S. request contains sufficient proof of activities that would also be illegal 
under Swiss law. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal would be directly to the Swiss Supreme Court in Lausanne and those 
proceedings would mean several additional weeks in prison for the flamboyant 
Saudi Arabian businessman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Visits Daily 
</P>
<P>
In the Iran arms scandal, Khashoggi put up collateral for the initial U.S. arms 
sales to Iran but later complained that the Reagan Administration reneged on 
its promise to repay him and fellow investors. He was reported to have been 
left $10 million short. 
</P>
<P>
In the scandal, which emerged in 1986, arms were sold to Iran in the hope that 
American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists would be released. 
Proceeds from the sales were funneled to Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi has U.S. and Swiss lawyers working on his case in Bern. They visit 
him several times daily to confer on strategy, as does his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is detained on a provisional basis, he uses his right to order meals 
from outside and gourmet food is delivered by his driver and bodyguards from 
the five-star Schweizerhof Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, 54, had been in Bern for cellular therapy, more commonly known as 
rejuvenation treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices gained ground for the second straight session Wednesday, bolstered 
by two big takeover bids in the communications industry and a belief that U.S. 
interest rates are headed lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 16.00 to 2,512.32 on top of 
Tuesday's 15.62-point rise. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 213.71 million shares, up from 
187.57 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc. soared 44 to 170 after a delayed opening, on word late Tuesday that 
Paramount Communications was making a $175-a-share cash tender offer for Time, 
which has been planning to merge with Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount shares rose 3/4 to 54 3/4, and Warner gained 1 3/4 to 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Lin Broadcasting jumped 26 to 129 1/2 and McCaw Cellular 
Communications gained 3 3/4 to 47 in the over-the-counter market. McCaw made a 
$120-a-share offer for Lin. 
</P>
<P>
Those developments prompted speculative buying of other communications stocks. 
For example, Racal Telecom rose 5 to 81 and Centel picked up 4 1/8 to 53. 
</P>
<P>
Regional telephone stocks also were broadly higher. BellSouth gained 1 3/8 to 
51; U.S. West 1 to 71; Nynex 2 5/8 to 82 5/8 and Southwestern Bell 1 to 53 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the overall market also continued to benefit from evidence that 
the Federal Reserve might have begun to relax its credit policy. The Fed this 
week has permitted, if not encouraged, a modest decline in the interest rate on 
federal funds, overnight loans between banks. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes that the central bank has succeeded in its bid to restrain inflation and 
may now ease credit face a possible test Friday, when the Labor Department 
issues its monthly report on the producer price index. 
</P>
<P>
Advance estimates call for the index to post an increase of 0.5% or 0.6%, up 
from 0.4% in April. 
</P>
<P>
Windmere dropped 2 1/8 to 14. The company said its manufacturing and shipping 
activities in the Far East have been curtailed by the effects of the political 
turmoil in China. 
</P>
<P>
Windmere shares traded as high as 29 earlier this year before worries about the 
situation in China started pushing them down. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices rebounded in slow trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday 
after four losing sessions shadowed by the turmoil in China. The Nikkei 
225-share average gained 174.88 points to close at 33,626.89 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times 100-share index gained for the second straight day after 
five days of losses prompted mainly by fears that sterling's weakness would 
force another rise in British interest rates. The 100-share index closed 10.5 
points higher at 2,117.9. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange on 
speculation that labor contract negotiations at major U.S. copper producers 
will be accompanied by strikes. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, precious metals were mixed, grain and soybean prices 
fell, livestock and meat prices were higher and energy futures declined. 
</P>
<P>
Copper rallied on word that officials of Magma Copper Inc. expected labor 
contract talks to be difficult and expected a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 2.25 cents to 2.45 cents lower with the contract for delivery in 
June at $1.0885 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Supply concerns were fueled by reports that Bougainville Copper Ltd.'s supply 
contracts were delayed by the shutdown of its Papua, New Guinea mine, said John 
O'Connell, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York. The mine has been damaged by 
attacks from native rebel landowners. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said the rise in copper prices also could be attributed partly to a 
comeback from a selloff spurred by the turmoil in China. The nation is a big 
copper importer and traders reacted to the upheaval there with a big selloff 
Tuesday due to speculation the troubles would disrupt commerce and industry 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices staged another broad advance, pushing interest rates lower amid 
optimism that U.S. interest rates have peaked. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 29/32 point, or $9 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
price, fell to 8.31% from 8.40% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond had not closed that low since March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate fell to 9.375% on Wednesday from 9.516% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar drifted in a narrow range in foreign-exchange trading and gold gave 
up part of the big gain made late in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $374 an ounce as of 4 
p.m. EDT, down from $376.70 an ounce late Tuesday. Gold had jumped about $12 an 
ounce in late trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose in overseas markets to catch up with the gains made late Tuesday in 
the New York trading session. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, gold rose $11.17 an ounce to a bid $376.61. Gold jumped in London 
to a late bid price of $375.65 from $365.25 In Zurich, the late bid was 
$374.50, up from $365.30 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $376.10 an ounce from $379.90 on Tuesday.

"Same Old Story," "In The Middle, Somewhat Elevated" and "Skinny" danced by 
this company, led by "bad boy" choreographer William Forsythe, are about as far 
from "Swan Lake" as hiking boots are from toe shoes. But judging from the 
reaction of the members of the audience to the opening night performance 
Tuesday at the Wiltern Theatre, they were grateful for the difference. Dancers 
received enthusiastic bravos, a standing ovation and several curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody yelled at me for wanting to do this," said choreographer and Dance 
Gallery artistic director Bella Lewitzky, a sly smile crossing her face, "but I 
felt Los Angeles deserved the Frankfurt company." 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky and the Dance Gallery were responsible for bringing Forsythe and his 
troupe for a two-night-only stop in Los Angeles. The first night included a 
post-performance benefit buffet supper in the theater lobby with proceeds to go 
to the Dance Gallery Presentations Program. 
</P>
<P>
When Forsythe made his entrance to the party, guests applauded, then cornered 
him in the lobby to gush about his greatness, compliments he humbly accepted. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, he said, 11% of the city's municipal budget goes to the arts; 
regrettably it isn't the same here. "Obviously there is such a spirit and 
support for the arts here, and the government doesn't acknowledge how important 
culture is for the spirit of a country." 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe, wearing a long black cardigan over black pants cinched in at the 
ankles and displaying a light scruffy beard, was proud of the work his dancers 
did that night. "I said, 'Show off.' I'm tough on them, but I love 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bain, co-chairwoman for both the gala and the Dance Gallery Guild, was 
still on a high from watching the performance. "Bella selected the Frankfurt 
Ballet," she said, blue eyes open wide, "and as she proved with the Olympic 
Arts Festival, she sure knows how to pick dance companies." 
</P>
<P>
"There was some risk-taking involved," Lewitzky said, "since people have never 
heard of Billy Forsythe. This man takes dance into a new aspect of theater. 
It's difficult to explain to someone, 'No, this is not a German regional ballet 
company.' It takes the seeing of it. But Los Angeles is a non-prejudicial 
audience, and I was not surprised (by the reaction). I feel my struggles were 
worth it; everybody has made a point of coming up to me and telling me how much 
they liked it. That's all I need to sigh a sigh of relief." 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand for the party were Doug Cramer (co-chairman, along with Herbert 
Ross, of the Frankfurt Ballet in Los Angeles), Shirlee Fonda, city Councilwoman 
Joy Picus, Judy Henning and Richard Rosenzweig, gala co-chairwomen Patti 
Amstutz and Elaine Caplow; Ruth and George Moss and Bettina and Andrew Klink. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers, who came to the party later, were easy to spot. They were the ones 
with wet hair, oversize bags slung over their shoulders and a ravenous 
appetites. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction from the audience -- it's not like that in Frankfurt," said 
dancer Thomas Stache. 
</P>
<P>
What have the dancers been doing on their brief stay in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the Valley from the top," Stache said, "and we went to the beach and I 
put my feet in the Pacific Ocean. And it was cold."

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: POST CARDS BEAR HISTORICAL MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What value is there to old post cards? Actually, what I have probably 
could not be called post "cards" as they are made of leather. 
</P>
<P>
I have six of them, dated 1906 and 1907. I have questioned people about them, 
and no one seems to have much information to offer. They were mailed by my 
uncle in Oakland to my mother and grandmother in Iowa and Minnesota. -- P.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Post cards are popular in this country and abroad. They fall into a 
number of categories, including those that advertise products, greeting cards, 
those sold in conjunction with expositions, photographic cards and the common 
holiday variety. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are so many categories, collectors advise those new to the field 
to specialize. Also, they urge beginning collectors to attempt to build their 
collection on cards only in top condition. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are generally pegged to condition, rarity and, of course, how many cards 
of a particular category were printed or circulated. Artistic reproductions 
signed by the artist can command a premium. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "golden age" for post cards is considered the era from a few 
years before the turn of this century to about the end of World War I. Cards 
printed during that period usually attract the most collector demand. 
</P>
<P>
Post card prices range all over the lot -- from a few cents per card to several 
hundred dollars for rare cards, according to dealer catalogue quotes. 
</P>
<P>
As for cards made of leather, we have not seen any examples; but that doesn't 
mean there is not a market for them. If any of our readers know anything about 
your uncle's unusual cards, you can be fairly sure they'll write us. 
</P>
<P>
Mailbag 
</P>
<P>
A baseball-card swap meet will be held at the Discovery Museum in Santa Ana as 
part of a Fathers' Day celebration June 17. 
</P>
<P>
The swap meet is in conjunction with an old-time baseball photo exhibit and a 
display of baseball memorabilia, according to a museum announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is located at 3101 W. Harvard St., Santa Ana. Hours: 11 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Admission: $1 for adults, 50 cents for children. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call (714) 540-0404. 
</P>
<P>
While on the subject of baseball cards, we recently received a baseball card 
book based on the famous Topps collection. What the Los Angeles-based 
publishing firm has done is break down the Topps baseball card collection for 
each major-league team. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-book series has color reproductions of more than 21,000 Topps cards 
covering the years 1952-1988, and a brief summation of what happened to the 
team for each of these years. 
</P>
<P>
The book we have displays baseball cards for the players on the Dodgers' 1952 
pennant-winning team, including such "boys of summer" as Jackie Robinson, Roy 
Campanella and Duke Snider. 
</P>
<P>
Each book is $9.95, plus $2 for shipping. The address: Price Stern Sloan, Cash 
Sales, 360 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90048.

A MEMOIR OF VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From That Place and Time: A Memoir, 1938-1947 by Lucy S. Dawidowicz (W. W. 
Norton: $19.95, 330 pages) 
</P>
<P>
When we contemplate the Holocaust, we are horrified by the monstrous 
instruments of death, and we are dazed by the sheer numbers of the dead -- we 
are tempted to see only the long lines of nameless victims in the ghetto, the 
concentration camp, the killing pit. But the horror and the sadness are all the 
greater when we remember that every man, woman or child who died at Auschwitz 
or Babi Yar came from a home, a family, a neighborhood, a school, a job. Before 
they were victims, they were human beings like you and me. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Dawidowicz, a distinguished historian whom we know best as the author of 
"A Holocaust Reader" and "The War Against the Jews," was an eyewitness to this 
neglected aspect of the Holocaust. On the very eve of World War II, she spent a 
year in the Jewish community of Vilna, and she witnessed the last days of 
Yiddish civilization in Poland -- a passionate and lively community with a 
1,000-year-old civilization of superb intellectual and cultural accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
As a Holocaust memoir, "From That Place and Time" is unique -- Dawidowicz saw 
not a single death, but her testimony is all the more poignant, all the more 
telling, because she was one of the last witnesses to see Vilna and its people 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Posthumous Life' 
</P>
<P>
"Vilna exists now only in memory and history," she explains of her compulsion 
to write about her sojourn in Vilna. "I wanted to reconstruct, as best I could, 
the Vilna I knew, the world capital of the realm of Yiddish, as I had seen it 
in that last year of its authentic life. I wanted to bestow upon it and its 
Jews a posthumous life." 
</P>
<P>
Dawidowicz, an American Jew growing up in New York in the '30s, was given the 
opportunity to pursue her studies in Yiddish language and culture at YIVO, the 
Yiddish Research Institute of Vilna. In a real sense, "From That Place and 
Time" is YIVO's memoir, a eulogy for a unique academic institution that 
embodied the brave hope of Yiddish scholars who sought to preserve and study 
their culture, even as Hitler (and his momentary ally, Stalin) were plotting to 
obliterate it. Hitler and Stalin were successful, of course, and both YIVO and 
Yiddish survive only in exile. But Dawidowicz's memoir pays homage to the 
glories of Yiddish culture in its native soil: "It was a feverish flowering in 
the shadow of death," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
I hasten to point out that Dawidowicz's memoir is not a lament. She allows us 
to see the world of the '30s and '40s, both in Europe and New York, through the 
eyes of an appealing young woman with a passion for history and language, 
politics and poetry, as well as the more customary passions of youth. What's 
most important, I feel, is that Dawidowicz gives us such vivid portraits of the 
poets who courted her, the teachers who became her mentors and surrogate 
parents, the young men and women who became her intimate friends. Dawidowicz 
gives names and faces to these otherwise anonymous victims of Nazi brutality, 
and by doing so, she ultimately rescues them from the awful maw of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11th-Hour Escape 
</P>
<P>
Dawidowicz's book is also a kind of adventure story -- she was nearly caught in 
the Nazi invasion of Poland, and her 11th-hour escape through Germany is a 
frightening and ominous episode: an American passport allowed one Jew to 
survive, but she was forced to leave behind millions of other Jews for whom 
there was no refuge. On her return to New York, she worked in YIVO's 
headquarters-in-exile; the war years were a kind of death watch, as she learned 
of the atrocities carried out in the places where she had lived and against the 
people she had known and loved. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so assaulted and battered by history that my personal life had all but 
collapsed," she recalls. "I had not yet entirely exorcised my guilt feelings 
for having fled to safety." Even among her colleagues at YIVO, including a few 
fortunate souls who managed to escape Vilna, the fate of those trapped in 
Europe was too painful to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"We had learned to control our physical revulsion and to stifle our grief. We 
endured our despair in silence. It was as if these events were off-limits for 
human intercourse, as if the world we had once known and now read about had 
been sucked into a terrible pit of nothingness." 
</P>
<P>
"From That Place and Time" closes on a note of redemption. Dawidowicz returned 
to Europe after the war to work with Holocaust survivors -- "the remnant that 
was saved," in the biblical phrase -- and she managed to rescue at least a 
symbolic remnant of the Vilna community itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sense of Holiness 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis, it turned out, had systematically looted the libraries and museums 
of the very Jewish communities that they sought to destroy; Dawidowicz was 
given the task of examining tens of thousands of stolen books and artifacts in 
a noble effort to restore these treasures to their owners. All too many of "the 
orphaned books," of course, were marked "Hebraisch ohne Besitz" -- "Hebrew 
ownerless" -- but, remarkably enough, Dawidowicz discovered the remnants of the 
YIVO library of Vilna. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a state of exaltation," she writes. "I wrote home that when I came 
across these YIVO books, I had 'a feeling akin to holiness, that I was touching 
something sacred.' " 
</P>
<P>
I felt something of that exaltation, something of that sense of holiness, as I 
read "From That Place and Time." Dawidowicz honors the martyrs of the Holocaust 
-- and enriches the literature of the Holocaust -- simply by showing us what 
kind of people they were before they suffered their martyrdom.

Fabulous Nobodies by Lee Tulloch (William Morrow: $16.95; 288 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Although the editors of this section make a heroic effort to match reviewers to 
books, sometimes they have to settle for less than perfection. Where do you 
find a critic in sympathy with idea that "people would be a lot happier if they 
talked to their clothes more often" -- one who could also appreciate the style 
of a novelist who uses the word frock an average of five times per page? 
</P>
<P>
Given these impossible parameters, you might just draw straws. "Fabulous 
Nobodies" is a genuine rarity, a novel that is totally reviewer-proof. Those 
who might want it simply don't exist in the same space-time continuum with 
those who might be obliged to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
Meant to satirize the terminally trendy denizens of the Lower East Side 
nightclub circuit, the book merely reproduces the numbing banality of their 
existence. While waiting for the clubs to open, Reality Nirvana Tuttle and her 
cohort lie around deciding what to be that night, a complex choice that 
involves not only the outfit itself but an entire personality and often a 
gender. The possibilities provide the dialogue. "Vamp, tramp, flapper, sleaze, 
mod, postmod, Pop Art, disco, retro, rococo, go-go, gypsy, new wave, new 
romantic, New Look, Carnaby Street, Cossack, Bonnie and Clyde, directoire, 
debutante, existentialist, belle epoque, buffalo girl, baby doll, Barbarella, 
punk, postpunk, Pre-Raphaelite, even preppy if I want to, which is almost 
never." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Time for Food, Work or Sex 
</P>
<P>
The selection process as practiced here leaves virtually no time for food, work 
or even sex. Phoebe Johnson, Reality's best friend, has turned herself into a 
clone of Audrey Hepburn, circa 1958, right down to the clavicle, but she's 
exceptional. No one else has made that sort of commitment. If you were going to 
take this concoction seriously, you might say it's about a young woman's search 
for identity, but that's like deconstructing the message in a fortune cookie. 
The insights here exist on the same philosophical plane. "The nature of Fame -- 
a great door, but an empty room." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the recent spate of downtown novels celebrating depravity of all sorts, 
the paper cutouts in "Fabulous Nobodies" are almost as wholesome as Bobbsey 
twins, if you can only imagine Freddie as a transvestite. The narrator, Reality 
(her mother was a hippie) not only talks to her clothes but to her pajama bag, 
her wigs, shoes, underwear, eyelashes, and yes, even to her press-on nails, 
though only the "frocks" have movie stars' names. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Totally Fulfilled Person 
</P>
<P>
When we first meet her, she's still employed at a nightclub as the door guard, 
where her job is to decide who looks "fab" enough to be admitted. Though at 
this moment, she's a totally fulfilled person "in total harmony with the 
contents of my closet," she longs to appear in the fashion column written by 
Hugo a Go-Go, the star journalist of a throwaway called Frenzee, avidly read by 
180,000 fabulous somebodies who were nobodies until Hugo mentioned them. 
</P>
<P>
On duty at the club one night, Reality brusquely turns away a middle-aged woman 
in a navy cardigan who turns out to be the real Jackie O. She is immediately 
sacked, but fortunately she can spend her waking hours with Freddie, an 
adorable transvestite with a sound head for business. They establish a 
partnership and convert their rooms into a rival club. 
</P>
<P>
This is easier than it sounds, because these clubs require little in the way of 
decoration, facilities, staff, permits or rent, none of which becomes an issue. 
Reality and Freddie grab a red vinyl sofa out from under two derelicts in 
Tompkins Square park, print up some matchbooks, and that's it. Hugo covers the 
thrilling event for his journal, and our heroine not only gets her mention, but 
the epicene mentioner himself. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone says "frock" for dress and "crimplene" for polyester because the 
author is Australian, though Reality Nirvana, Freddie, Hugo, Phoebe and the 
clothes are American. Previously employed at Harper's Bazaar, Australia, and as 
fashion and beauty editor of Vogue, Australia, Tulloch has obviously paid her 
professional dues. It's our turn now.

Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi has ordered the country's prisons cleared of 
all inmates detained without trial or charge, according to reports in the 
nation's three English-language newspapers. Moi reportedly issued the order at 
a rally earlier in the week. Moi did not name the affected detainees nor their 
number, but the papers identified three as lawyer Mirugi Kariuki, business 
executive Israel Otieno Agina and a former air force private, Richard Obuon 
Guya. The three were detained in crackdowns on groups suspected of trying to 
overthrow Moi. Internal security officials could not be reached for comment.

HOSPITAL TURN-AWAY PLAN IRKS LEGISLATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Orange County legislators complained Wednesday that UCI Medical Center 
had failed to notify them of a new policy to turn away women in labor whenever 
its emergency room and obstetrics ward are full. 
</P>
<P>
Had they learned of the university hospital's "drastic" plans, they might have 
sought emergency funding or asked other hospitals and county officials to seek 
a solution for overcrowding of the obstetrics ward, the legislators said. 
</P>
<P>
But, they said, no UCI official called them and they only learned about the new 
policy after the fact, from newspaper accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is unfortunate. I would like to have been able to use whatever 
efforts I could to help the situation," said state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), a member of the Appropriations Committee who often sponsors 
health care legislation. Instead, she said, "we have not had communications 
this year" about such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson also expressed alarm and dismay about the policy itself, which the 
medical center began implementing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When the hospital is full, the "obstetrical diversion" plan takes effect: The 
facility's security guards will greet a woman in labor at the curb, telling her 
to go elsewhere and handing her a map and a list of area hospitals. But women 
who have had prenatal care at UCI Medical Center will be given priority during 
an announced "deflection," hospital officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter Friday explaining the new policy, hospital officials said that 
obstetrical services are strained and sometimes "unsafe" and that doctors are 
treating 500 patients a month in a ward designed for 250. Reportedly 90% of the 
women in labor at the medical center are indigent and most have received no 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson on Wednesday called the new policy "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot send a woman in labor out onto the street without assurance that 
she's going to have an effective delivery," the senator said. "I would say it's 
irresponsible from the health and safety (standpoint) of that woman." 
</P>
<P>
Also concerned about the hospital's actions was Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress), who sits on the Assembly Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said UCI Medical Center officials had kept her informed of the financial 
problems, including the fact that the hospital is rapidly going bankrupt 
treating 65% of the county's poor. Noting that she is sympathetic to their 
problems, Allen said she has been working to increase the medical center's 
reimbursement rate from the state Medi-Cal system. 
</P>
<P>
But, the assemblywoman said, aside from newspaper accounts in the last few 
days, she has heard nothing about the medical center's crisis in obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
"I would wish they had called to see if there's something they could do before 
taking this drastic measure" and deciding to turn women in labor away, Allen 
said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she could have helped, Allen replied: "Well, I certainly could 
have tried. I could have talked to other hospitals in the county to see if 
there was something we could do short of putting those patients in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said she does not know whether UCI Medical Center officials asked county 
officials for help before implementing the plan. But if the medical center 
officials "have not worked with other hospitals in the county, yes, I would 
fault them," she said. "If they are overcrowded, they should get on the phone 
-- and not send security guards" to turn away pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) said he learned of the new policy from a 
newspaper account and wondered why he had not been contacted by UCI. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospital Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Green said he planned to write a letter to UCI "asking what I can do to help 
the situation," but he criticized the university hospital for its new policy. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, he said, has "a moral obligation to take care of the indigent." 
Also, Green said, "any doctor practicing has sworn a Hippocratic oath. If 
they're not taking care of the sick, they're not keeping up with their oath." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) also said he thinks the medical center has 
a responsibility not to turn away any woman in labor. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, when I learned of this policy, I was rather shocked," Seymour 
said. He added that although he is not a lawyer, he believes that it is illegal 
and "the wrong way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he met with UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason and UCI Medical Center 
executive director Mary A. Piccione several months ago about working to improve 
the reimbursement rate for Medi-Cal services, but they did not mention the 
crisis in obstetrics or a strategy to turn some of those patients away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's wrong that a state-supported institution is supporting this 
policy," Seymour said. He said officials knew years ago when they purchased the 
old County of Orange public hospital for their medical center that care for the 
poor "would be one of their primary responsibilities. . . . Ultimately it's the 
public's responsibility to care for the poor and this is a public institution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burden of Caring for Poor 
</P>
<P>
Piccione and Walter Henry, UCI vice chancellor for health services, who 
supervises the medical center, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But 
they have previously said that the medical center's primary purpose is teaching 
and research, not shouldering the burden of caring for most of Orange County's 
poor patients. 
</P>
<P>
Also interested in the "obstetrical diversion" policy was Orange County 
Supervisor Don R. Roth, whose district includes the medical center. Roth said 
he doubts that the county can help. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is we have a hiring freeze here, we're closing facilities. We're 
broke. . . . I can't do anything for UCI until I have some money. If somebody 
sends me some money, I'll run over this afternoon," Roth said.

UCI STUDENTS RALLY FOR CHINESE; 
</P>
<P>
HUNDREDS JOIN IN PROTESTING CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Like the Chinese students who demonstrated in Tian An Men Square, Zining Mu 
would rather be in the classroom. But like those students, many of whom were 
his former classmates at Beijing University, the UC Irvine doctoral candidate 
said he was driven to speak out in anger and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of Beijing students have been killed and many more have 
disappeared," Mu told the UCI students who overflowed the university's Gateway 
Plaza, surrounding steps and balconies during an emotional memorial Wednesday 
for the Chinese protesters massacred by troops in recent days. "In all of 
history, the true numbers may never be known. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell all the world, the Chinese people love freedom, love democracy," he 
implored, his voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's martyred students were remembered in Chinese and English, by Asians 
and non-Asians alike, during a noontime service that drew hundreds to the 
campus's central plaza. The strong turnout surprised even organizers of the 
service at UCI, where one out of three undergraduates is of Asian heritage. A 
crowd estimated at more than 700 attended a candlelight vigil held in the plaza 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
During the noon gathering, the crowd shouted and clapped when a symbolic coffin 
was carried onto the plaza, as well as when speakers called for the overthrow 
of China's hard-line leaders. Most in the crowd wore black armbands passed out 
early in the memorial. Many cried. 
</P>
<P>
And in a moving climax, more than 100 students and faculty joined Chinese 
language professor Richard Liao to sing, in Chinese, a song of patriotism and 
empowerment. Behind the singers, clusters of black and white helium balloons 
were released into the smudged gray sky. 
</P>
<P>
"Help me sing it!" Liao called to the crowd. "Help the people of China!" 
</P>
<P>
UCI's second-in-command, Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien, was one of 
the impromptu singers. Tien, whose family fled Shanghai literally hours before 
the Communist takeover in 1949, said Wednesday, "Everything that happens in 
China is very close to me." 
</P>
<P>
Tien said he did not anticipate "the depth of feeling and emotion that I saw 
from all the young people" at the Gateway Plaza service. "They were very, very 
supportive. They can really help in terms of world opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Television footage of protesters shot, burned and crushed by military tanks has 
been a powerful link to China for the students of UCI. Many, such as Alicia 
Malone, a junior from West Covina, expressed shock at the sudden military 
violence in a country they had believed was moving toward Western ideals of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"I've shed a few tears for those students in Tian An Men Square," she said. "I 
came to the memorial today to show my support. I hope the students and the 
people will win in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Deck, who wore a black armband and carried a book-filled backpack, 
called the service "our statement." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that people voice their disapproval of what has 
happened in China," said the UCI mathematics and economics student from Irvine. 
"We care a lot about what's going on there." 
</P>
<P>
Standing amid protest signs and banners of support for the students of Beijing, 
Jeff Huang held an effigy -- a stuffed turtle, actually -- intended to 
represent Deng Xiao-ping, the 84-year-old Chinese leader who is rumored to be 
dead or dying. 
</P>
<P>
"People wonder where Deng is," said Huang, whose family fled China for Taiwan 
40 years ago. "I've got him right here." 
</P>
<P>
In a tattered brown paper bag, Huang also carried more than $200 in donations 
collected from fellow UCI students, money he said will be donated to the Red 
Cross to assist injured Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I was born in Taiwan, we all came from China," Huang explained. 
"If China can become a democratic country, every Chinese would go there. That 
is the hope of every Chinese in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Passers-by dropped dollars into another donations box carried through the 
Gateway Plaza crowd by Yi-Juan Zheng, who is one of 45 students and 20 scholars 
from mainland China now at UCI. Tears streaming down her cheeks, Zheng accepted 
a tissue from one of the strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Zheng, who is working toward a Ph.D. in economics, was an instructor at Xiaman 
University near Hong Kong until 1987. She has not returned to China in two 
years, but the distance has never seemed as far as in the last several days, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening she has watched television reports of the violence in Beijing and 
other Chinese cities. On Wednesday, in a telephone call from her mother, Zheng 
said she learned that two of her former students had been killed in Tian An Men 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
"They are my favorite students," Zheng said. "I would like to be there for all 
the people who die. But my mother says, 'Stay there. It will be safer for you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so sick," she cried. "I can't go home." 
</P>

TOXIC SPILL SLOWS 8 MILES OF TRAFFIC ON HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleanup of a toxic spill along busy Imperial Highway on Wednesday caused 
massive traffic problems but no injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill involved about 200 gallons of a caustic soda chemical from a tanker 
truck, said Kathleen Cha, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
She said the chemical, which contained sodium hydroxide, could injure skin. 
</P>
<P>
The substance leaked from the tanker truck on Tuesday afternoon, but was not 
discovered until Wednesday, Cha said. According to a County Fire Department 
dispatcher, the spill extended about 8 miles along Imperial Highway, between 
Valley View Street and Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said a filtration company which had ordered the chemical will pay the costs 
of the cleanup. She said that a private firm that specializes in such work was 
hired to remove the chemical from the roadway and dispose of it. 
</P>
<P>
No evacuations were necessary in the area, fire officials said, but one lane of 
Imperial Highway had to be closed during most of the cleanup. Cha said that it 
is possible that some motorists drove through the chemical Tuesday night or 
Wednesday morning before it was discovered by fire officials and the cleanup 
work could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said anyone who suspects he or she drove through the chemical should hose 
down their vehicles with "lots of water and be careful to wear gloves."

TUSTIN TEACHER GETS $3,500 TO SETTLE HARASSMENT CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin Unified School District has agreed to pay $3,500, in addition to 
reinstating 34 days of sick leave, to teacher Kent Moore, who filed a workers 
compensation complaint alleging that he became ill as a result of three years 
of harassment and mistreatment by his employers. 
</P>
<P>
The school district offered the settlement the day Moore's case was to be heard 
by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, according to both Moore and Tustin 
schools Supt. Maurice Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the harassment began with a survey sent out to several teachers in 
1986 by his then-supervisor, asking them to comment on Moore's job performance 
but not to tell him about it. 
</P>
<P>
Moore alleged that he was badly treated because he was a member of the Orange 
County Grand Jury when it launched several investigations of County Schools 
Supt. Robert Peterson, a friend of Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Moore served on the grand jury in 1981-82 and has been a member of the Assn. of 
Former Grand Jurors ever since. For the last few years, he has been on the 
association's education subcommittee, which suggests topics for the grand jury 
to investigate. And he said that his troubles at the school district began when 
he joined that subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that I was a company man, I was respected by my supervisors, 
I got along well at the district level, and all of a sudden it deteriorated," 
Moore said. Ross vehemently denied that Moore's involvement with the grand jury 
had anything to do with his treatment by district administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolutely ridiculous," Ross said. "This is the first I've ever known 
he was still on the education subcommittee." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, in documents filed with the state appeals board, alleged that he 
suffered from "gastrointestinal and mental distress" as a result of the 
district's behavior. As a result, he said, he missed 34 days of school in that 
period. Moore, whose title is work experience coordinator, helps to place 
learning disabled students in part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when he learned of the survey, he complained to his supervisor 
that such an evaluation, without the consent of an employee, was a violation of 
the district's master contract with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he tried to get a response, or a chance to include his own comments 
on the survey, but was rebuffed at every level, either by failure to answer his 
memos or bullying from some superiors who were angered that he questioned their 
motives. He finally went to the superintendent with his complaint, he said, but 
eventually had to ask the district teachers' union to intervene on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he alleged, his supervisors piled more duties on him. One 
time, he said, they required him to fill out a log documenting what he did 
every 15 minutes of his workday. It was a requirement that no one else in his 
position had to meet, he said.

' . . . CLANCY'S A LOSER WHO'S A WINNER'; 
</P>
<P>
UGLY? HE TAKES TITLE PAWS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clancy is an unusual dog. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he's so ugly, he's cute. Part basset hound, part springer 
spaniel, Clancy has stubby legs and front paws that point out at 80-degree 
angles -- like a ballet dancer's feet. 
</P>
<P>
"He recently won the title of the ugliest dog in the county, and that won $200 
for the Animal Assistance League," said Lydia Yancey, a league worker. "So 
Clancy's a loser who's a winner. He may be ugly, but he's got a wonderful 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
Yancey said she rescued the dog she dubbed Clancy from a pound in mid-April. 
She's been trying to find a permanent home for him for the past two months. But 
he is so photogenic -- ugly mug and all -- that the Garden Grove woman now 
wonders if the Animal Assistance League may not have found a new Spuds 
McKenzie, of sorts, right here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Canines vying for the Ugliest Dog in Orange County title last month competed by 
having their owners send in photographs to the radio station sponsoring the 
contest. Yancey mailed in a humorous photo of Clancy in his natural ballet 
stance, posed by a collection of ballet slippers. Judges obviously liked the 
photograph, because Clancy won the title. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should get him an agent," joked Yancey as she showed off Clancy. "But 
what I really want is a nice home for Clancy. I want to find some people who 
will take him for what he is and will love him." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Clancy is easy to love. The dog, thought to be about 2 years old, is 
a friendly animal with sorrowful eyes -- from his basset hound genes -- and 
curly white, brown and black hair -- from his springer spaniel genes. 
</P>
<P>
But he looks, well, improbable. One gets the impression that he's a mixed-up 
collage of animal parts that really don't go together. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a nice head," said Gabrielle Vandenbosh, a league worker. "But the head 
doesn't seem to go with the body." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Clancy's big head and floppy black ears seem very out of proportion to 
his low-slung body and stubby front legs. When he walks, he looks like a canine 
version of a low-rider automobile. 
</P>
<P>
And walking is no easy chore for Clancy because of his angled front paws. "He 
gets tired if he walks more than a block or so," Yancey said. "He likes to rest 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Clancy first came to Yancey's attention on April 10 as the dog took a snooze on 
a sidewalk near 5th and Fairview streets in Santa Ana. Yancey thought the dog 
had been hurt and was lying awkwardly because of an injury. She later learned 
that Clancy -- a blissful couch potato -- just happens to sleep flopped partly 
on one side. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on my way to rescue a cat that day, but I was very worried about the 
dog, and I called people to come get him," she said. "He was picked up by 
animal control and taken to the pound. I then canvassed the neighborhood 
looking for his owners, and I advertised and contacted the school nearby." 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he was scheduled to be put to sleep by the pound after 72 hours, I 
bought him out and took him here to the Animal Assistance League kennel in 
Midway City," Yancey said. 
</P>
<P>
The league, a nonprofit volunteer organization, has its kennel at 15101 Jackson 
St., near Beach Boulevard and Bolsa Avenue. Dogs and cats kept at the kennel 
are sort of hard-luck cases, Vandenbosh said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to find homes for special dogs, such as Angel here, this poor female 
dog who is almost blind and who was found starving to death in Modjeska 
Canyon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can see dogs and cats up for adoption at the Animal Assistance League 
kennel any day, including weekends, from 10 a.m. to noon and 4 to 6 p.m., 
Vandenbosh said. 
</P>
<P>
Some prospective pet owners have looked at Clancy over the past two months, but 
they bypassed him in favor of dogs with more eye-appeal. Yancey said it's 
unfortunate that people don't see the real animal under the homely exterior. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a gentle, good dog, and the vet says he would be a wonderful pet for an 
older couple -- because Clancy likes to rest a lot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
People interested in adopting Clancy -- or any other dog or cat -- can call 
Vandenbosh at (714) 964-7471 or Pat Malberg, another league volunteer, at (714) 
990-5804. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd keep him myself, but I have a big dog who's very jealous of other dogs," 
Yancey said. "But I'll miss Clancy. He's a mellow fellow. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know what? He would really make a good ad for selling ballet shoes."

SHE HEARD TAPS AND FIGURED OUT A CODE;

<P>
DISPATCHER MADE GOOD GUESS ON 911 CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 4:30 a.m. when Garden Grove police dispatcher Sheryl Wynn answered the 
911 call and heard the tapping noises. 
</P>
<P>
Crank calls on the 911 line aren't uncommon. Callers who dial and hang up 
aren't uncommon either. Wynn decided to treat this call as neither. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping back, Wynn, 39, "established that two taps was for yes, and one was for 
no," she said Wednesday. "I asked her, 'Have you had a heart attack? Or a 
stroke? She tapped one for the heart attack and twice for the stroke, which was 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
Within a few moments, Wynn had established her communication system with Lisa 
Quick, 49, of Garden Grove, who had, in fact, suffered a minor stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn immediately dispatched police and paramedics to Quick's apartment in a 
large complex on Euclid Avenue, Police Sgt. Douglas Morrill said. Although the 
front door was locked, Wynn directed paramedics to a front window after being 
informed by Quick that it had been left open. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn is being considered for a commendation for her actions last Thursday, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic that she would be creative and think of that," said Capt. John 
Baker. "Lord knows we get enough of what we call the 911 hang-up calls. It is 
easy to get cynical and hang up, but she didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Morrill said police receive so many "crank" calls on the emergency 
line that he praised Wynn for "staying with it." 
</P>
<P>
Quick was taken to UCI Medical Center where she was treated and eventually 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn said she always assumes that the caller isn't a crank. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I learned to take the worst scenario I can and put that into 
action. If it turns out not to be that, then no big deal, I'm not really put 
out by it all. If it is, well, I'd hate to treat something like a crank or a 
bogus call and then have somebody hurt or sick who was trying to call."

NEWPORT AIR CRASH INQUIRY FOCUSES ON POSSIBLE PILOT ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal air safety investigator said Wednesday that he has shifted his focus 
to possible human error as a key factor in the March 31 crash of a twin-engine 
Piper Aerostar in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The plane slammed into a tennis court at the Newport Beach Tennis Club minutes 
after taking off from John Wayne Airport, narrowly missing several tennis 
players on the ground and killing all five people aboard -- a vacationing 
family from Alberta, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jeff Rich said that the 
Aerostar's roll down the runway at John Wayne Airport was too slow and took up 
twice as much space as it should have, and then the plane turned south without 
sufficient airspeed, leading investigators to speculate that pilot Anthony Deis 
made "incorrect" decisions under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mechanic Error Cited 
</P>
<P>
Rich also disclosed that the same Ohio mechanic who had installed a fuel line 
injector nozzle in the wrong location in the plane's right engine in 1983 made 
the same mistake on an Aerostar that crashed earlier this year in Louisiana, 
killing the pilot. "I became quite concerned and notified the Federal Aviation 
Administration," Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not an enforcement agency," Rich said of the NTSB. "It's up to the FAA 
to deal with the mechanic." Rich said he did not know what, if any, action had 
been taken in connection with the mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
FAA officials were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"Mechanical problems alone did not cause the plane to end up in the tennis 
court," Rich said. "Performance charts for this aircraft show that losing an 
engine would not by itself cause the plane to be unflyable. . . . But the laws 
of aerodynamics and physics are unmerciful. If you lift off when you shouldn't, 
or turn the plane without the required airspeed, you will drop. We see it all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rich said that interviews with witnesses at the airport indicated that Deis had 
insufficient engine power during his roll down the runway and was going too 
slowly. Asked if Deis could have mistakenly attributed the lack of power to a 
heavy passenger load, Rich said: "I don't know." But Rich said ground observers 
heard an engine sputtering even as the plane lifted off. 
</P>
<P>
Another unanswered question, Rich added, is whether Deis knew how much runway 
he had used up and how much remained. 
</P>
<P>
He said such questions and factors such as Deis' training and experience, and 
the fact that "his adrenaline was flowing," must be weighed before the NTSB in 
Washington can conclude that Deis should have decided to abort the takeoff or 
fly straight ahead over Upper Newport Bay instead of turning south over 
Eastbluff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Report Facts' 
</P>
<P>
"That's the human factor," Rich said. "I don't draw any conclusions. . . . I 
just report facts." 
</P>
<P>
Rich said that although Deis had been certified by Canadian authorities to fly 
an Aerostar, pilots' skill and knowledge of emergency procedures deteriorate 
quickly after exams "unless they practice frequently." 
</P>
<P>
Rich said that traces of a foam seal sucked into the right engine's 
turbocharger from an air intake door have been found in the fuel injector 
nozzle, which was attached to the engine's air-mixing box at the wrong 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear how the engine problem developed, but, unfortunately, that's 
not the end of it," Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rich had disclosed that traces of the seal were found in the 
turbocharger, but the nozzle had not yet been checked.

GARDEN GROVE COUPLE RETURNED BEFORE CHINA'S ERUPTION; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVELERS SAW THE UPHEAVAL SIMMERING 
</P>

<P>
From airplanes, tour buses and trains that took them on an 18-day tour, Joyce 
and Edward Johnson of Garden Grove had front-row seats on the early scenes of 
what has become a drama of democracy and repression in China. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons returned from their China trip May 26, but they saw more than just 
a glimpse of the tension between demonstrators and the government -- which was 
to turn into a massacre a few days after they left. 
</P>
<P>
The couple -- he is retired and she is a trustee in the Garden Grove Unified 
School District -- were touring the country, a nation they had not yet visited. 
</P>
<P>
What they remember most are the countless people demonstrating, and their quiet 
way of doing it. A few days after they left, the quiet turned into an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons were in Bejing's Tian An Men Square when Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev visited, when the throngs of students demonstrating in the giant 
plaza were newly arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"If you looked in that square, there were over 1 million people there," Edward 
Johnson said. "If you have ever seen a million people at one time, it is 
something that's fantastic. . . . I saw nothing but heads everywhere. It sure 
is overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Johnson said knots of students -- 10 or 12 -- would gather at utility 
poles to read the signs that were posted often with news from other 
demonstration points. 
</P>
<P>
The couple first flew to Hong Kong, then made their way by train and boat to 
several cities in China. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a lot of protesters in Shanghai," she said. "The students were all 
over. They were protesting at different places -- downtown, in the city 
squares, where there would be shops and different places, wherever you had 
universities, and there were universities everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They were quiet, but the numbers -- they were just really protesting en masse, 
with their actual bodies, being there. 
</P>
<P>
"When we reached Shanghai, there were rumors that students that had been 
fasting, that some of them had died, or so it was said," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The students we saw protesting had made floral wreaths out of paper, and they 
were wearing black armbands and marching in the street. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet, they were quiet and still didn't do anything but block the streets 
and be there in their numbers," she said.

GRETZKY FIRST TO WIN NHL'S MOST VALUABLE TROPHY FOR NINTH TIME 
</P>

<P>
Wayne Gretzky of the Kings was named the National Hockey League's most valuable 
player Wednesday night, winning the Hart Trophy for a record ninth time. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky became the first player in NHL history to win the same award nine 
times. Bobby Orr won the Norris Trophy as best defenseman eight times. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who broke Gretzky's eight-year reign as MVP last 
season and has won the last two scoring titles, was second in the voting, 
conducted by the Professional Hockey Writers Assn. Detroit's Steve Yzerman, 
third behind Lemieux and Gretzky in the scoring race, was third. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who led Edmonton to four Stanley Cups in five years, was traded to the 
Kings by the Oilers last August in a blockbuster deal. With Gretzky, the Kings 
improved by 12 victories and 23 points, finishing second in the Smythe Division 
and beating the Oilers in the first round of the playoffs. They also set 
attendance records, selling out 24 of 40 regular-season home games. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky finished the season with 54 goals and 168 points in 78 games and he now 
has 1,837 career points, 13 short of the all-time record held by Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
Four members of the Montreal Canadiens, who lost the Stanley Cup to Calgary, 
received individual awards. Patrick Roy won the Vezina Trophy as the best 
goaltender, defenseman Chris Chelios won the Norris Trophy and Guy Carbonneau 
repeated as winner of the Selke Trophy, given to the best defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Montreal's Pat Burns won the Jack Adams Trophy as the league's top 
coach, an award voted by the NHL Broadcasters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Roy led all goaltenders with a 2.47 goals-against average and had a 33-5-6 
record as the Canadiens finished first in the league in defense. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios had 15 goals and 58 assists for 73 points, third on the Canadiens in 
scoring. Carbonneau, who also had his best offensive season with 26 goals, was 
one of the NHL's top penalty-killers and led the Canadiens at plus-37. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary had only one award winner. Joe Mullen captured the Lady Byng Trophy, 
given for skillful and gentlemanly play. Mullen had 51 goals and 59 assists for 
110 points while taking only 16 minutes in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, the 1987 winner, beat out last year's winner, Montreal's Mats Naslund, 
and Gretzky, who won in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers won the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the 
year. Leetch, who came to the Rangers after serving as captain of the U.S. 
Olympic Team, set an NHL record for goals by a rookie defenseman with 23. He 
added 48 assists for 71 points, leading all rookies in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Leetch is the first Ranger to win the award since Steve Vickers in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Tony Granato and Vancouver's Trevor Linden also were considered for 
the honor. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders won the King Clancy Memorial Award, 
given for humanitarian contributions to hockey. The Clancy Award, now in its 
second year, was won last year by Calgary's Lanny McDonald.

LEONARD'S CONDITION GIVES HIM CONFIDENCE FOR FIGHT WITH HEARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few days before the first Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight, in 1981, 
Leonard had a problem -- a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 days before the fight, he was elbowed accidentally in his left eye 
during a sparring session. The eye was discolored and swollen so badly 
Leonard's lawyer and adviser, Michael Trainer, wanted to call off the bout. 
Leonard overruled him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in perfect form, and you can't just throw that out the window and start 
over again," said Leonard. "I had been training so long, I was in the right 
frame of mind and great physical condition. I was where I am right now." 
</P>
<P>
One reason Leonard is so confident of knocking out Hearns here Monday night is 
that he is in such good condition for his age. The only question about his 
training is that he reached peak form two weeks ago and has been "maintaining" 
his edge ever since. 
</P>
<P>
If Leonard has his way, Hearns will be facing a force more like Marvelous 
Marvin Hagler, who stopped the "Hit Man" in a brutal three rounds in 1985, than 
the Leonard of 1981 who fought with an eye problem from the early rounds. 
Leonard wants Hearns to slug it out this time because Leonard says "my punches 
are a lot more devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard was not nearly as confident eight years ago. After getting the elbow in 
the eye, he took two days off. But after that the eye swelled each time he 
sparred. It was iced down after every workout. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard traces the beginning of his eye trouble to a 1979 fight with Marcos 
Geraldo. "Marcos Geraldo was the only time he had a serious eye problem and had 
to go to an eye doctor after a fight," said Trainer. 
</P>
<P>
But no serious damage was detected then, according to Trainer. Leonard fought 
nine more times before Hearns and once afterward before a detached retina was 
discovered in May 1982. "The day before he was operated on he passed all the 
eye tests because of where the tear was, which was probably the most difficult 
place to detect," Trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
In November 1984, Leonard announced the first of three retirements in his 
professional career. (Intending to get a college education, he also retired 
after winning his Olympic gold medal). 
</P>
<P>
Leonard was medically cleared to fight again in 1984, but after having to get 
off the canvas to stop Kevin Howard, he retired again. When he came back to 
fight Hagler in 1987, Leonard was questioned repeatedly about possible risks. 
Now, after victories over Hagler, and Donny Lalonde last November, Trainer 
calls the eye a "non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
But in the Hearns fight, the eye began swelling in the early rounds and was 
almost closed by the time Leonard, trailing on all three judges' scorecards, 
caught up to Hearns and stopped him in the 14th round. Leonard's face looked 
grotesque. At ringside, Trainer said he watched the swelling increase with a 
mixture of anger and worry. "But as it turned out," he said, "Ray was right. It 
was his night."

FRESHMAN SWIMMER IS DENIED SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Collins, a freshman swimmer at Tustin High School, has not been allowed 
to accept a $4,000 scholarship because it would affect his eligibility to 
compete in college. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 15, was named was one of 25 California athletes honored by the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation and Glendale Federal Bank. As part of the award, athletes 
would have received $4,000, paid over four years. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to defray the cost of training for Olympic hopefuls, 
according to Steve Rutledge, director of communications for the AAF. 
</P>
<P>
However, the the cash award would violate National College Athletic Assn. 
rules, according to Rick Evrard, an NCAA official. The AAF was informed of this 
decision on June 1, the day before the award ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Collins was one of 15 athletes who were not allowed to accept their cash 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA states that students may only accept actual and necessary expenses to 
participate by the school he attends or the organization that is sponsoring the 
competition," Evrard said. "Compensation, in any form, would violate (the 
NCAA's) amateur regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Collins has been swimming competitively for 10 years. He set three age-group 
national records at the age of 10. 
</P>
<P>
At the Southern Section 4-A meet in May, Collins finished 10th in the 100-yard 
breaststroke and 11th in the 200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge said that members of the AAF as well as parents of award winners had 
checked with the NCAA to make sure the cash awards were legal and understood 
the awards did not violate NCAA rules.

SANTA MARGARITA PLACED WITH PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Section Executive Committee voted, 7-4, Wednesday to group Santa 
Margarita High School with other parochial schools for the purpose of placing 
the school in an athletic league in the 1990-92 school years. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, a Catholic school that opened two years ago in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, had been rejected earlier by representatives both from the Catholic 
Athletic Assn. and the 54 principals from public leagues in Orange County in 
determining the placement of the school for the two-year cycle beginning in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Father Michael Harris, principal of Santa Margarita, said the team wants to 
play in a public league in the county, largely because of transportation costs. 
That grouping would set a precedent in the county but is common elsewhere in 
the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
The vote is expected to be appealed to the California Interscholastic 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita currently competes in the Olympic League, which is composed of 
private schools with an average enrollment of 470 students. Santa Margarita 
will play in the league next year, but the school is projected to grow to 1,200 
students by the time its first senior class graduates in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its projected size, the school would have to be grouped with county 
public schools or with parochial schools of similar enrollment in the 1990-92 
league realignment cycle. But neither the public schools nor the Catholic 
schools want to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
The school was accepted by league representatives of the county's public 
schools last month, then later the move was rejected when many of the county's 
54 public schools complained that they were not fairly represented at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Nicholas Wieczorek, representing the CAA, argued that the cost of 
transportation and distance of travel to CAA member schools, such as those in 
the Angelus and Del Rey leagues, would be unfair if Santa Margarita was placed 
with the parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David Larsen, representing the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District, argued that Santa Margarita has no boundaries and does not have to 
accept every student that applies; therefore, it has an unfair advantage over a 
public school in athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a religious issue, but a difference in educational philosophies," 
Larsen said. "The public schools in Orange County have a concern over Santa 
Margarita's athletic competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he understood the position of each side, and described his school 
as "a helpless pawn" amid the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no power or opportunity to control our destiny," Harris said. "We just 
want the opportunity to play. We don't want to cause harm to other schools or 
leagues. I don't see any harm in our kids playing in an Orange County athletic 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this perception that Santa Margarita is going to create problems for 
public high schools that is unfounded. I feel we've been judged, tried, 
convicted and sentenced before we've ever competed. Given the opportunity, it 
will work out." 
</P>
<P>
Father William Brelsford, principal at St. Bernard, said: "We still maintain 
that Santa Margarita belongs in the Orange County geographic location. That's 
the only issue we are concerned with. This will be appealed. That, I know." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar Principal Tom Jacobson, president of the council, also felt that 
by making an exception, the committee would be making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a major change in policy and practice that could set 
precedent," he said. "Do we make an exception or continue with a common 
practice of placing schools?"

FLUOR NET INCOME SPURTS IN QUARTER TO $23.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Fluor Corp. in Irvine reported that net income more than doubled to $23.9 
million in its fiscal second quarter ended April 30, compared to $10.3 million 
in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 42% 
from $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months, the international engineering and construction-services 
firm reported that earnings jumped to $45.5 million from $19.3 million. Revenue 
for the period was $3.1 billion, up 40% from $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that new awards for engineering and construction increased 27% 
to $1.7 billion during the first quarter over the same period a year ago, and 
the firm's backlog was up 33% on April 30 compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman David S. Tappan Jr. said the company's Fluor Daniel engineering and 
construction unit was the greatest contributor to earnings. He added that the 
company's coal and lead investments also reported earnings increases during the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increased volume, margins have continued to widen in the 
company's operations, Tappan said. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, which early in the decade invested heavily in coal and metals when 
prices for those commodities were at their peak and about to dive, has gone 
through a major reorganization and diversification since posting a net loss of 
$633.3 million for fiscal 1985. For last year, Fluor recorded its first 
operating profit since fiscal 1984 by earning $56 million for the year ended 
Oct. 31.

BEARDSLEY COLLECTION DISPLAYED AT HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The timing couldn't have been better: talent and technology coincided 
beautifully at the end of the 19th Century for controversial artist Aubrey 
Beardsley. 
</P>
<P>
Though little trained in art and only 25 when he died of tuberculosis in 1898, 
the drawings Beardsley made the last six years of his life are credited with 
influencing such giants of 20th-Century art as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and 
Edvard Munch. 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley's black-and-white drawings, usually for book or magazine 
illustrations, were printed -- when not suppressed -- through the then-new 
photo-mechanical reproduction process, said Miriam Stewart, a curatorial 
associate at Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. The reproductions were 
faithful to the drawings and cost less than those carved into wood blocks by 
craftsmen rather than the artist. 
</P>
<P>
The Fogg has more than 50 of the drawings, which were donated by two alumni. 
They constitute the most important collection of the artist's work outside 
Great Britain, said Fogg Curator of Drawings William Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six years the drawings are on public display, and for the 
first time in more than a dozen years, they are together in one exhibit. And 
since the drawings are on paper, making them delicate and sensitive to light, 
they can be exhibited only briefly, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They will be shown at Harvard's Sackler Museum through July 9 together with 
other material, including books illustrated by Beardsley, loaned by Harvard's 
Houghton Library, the Boston Public Library and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the drawings are overtly erotic; others have touches typical of his 
mischief. 
</P>
<P>
He usually started his drawings with pencil and perfected them with ink, 
Stewart said. In some, he used graphite. 
</P>
<P>
His acquaintances included the playwright Oscar Wilde, and Beardsley became a 
sensation with his illustrations for Wilde's play, "Salome," published in 1894. 
The illustraions were "described variously as having nothing to do with the 
play and everything to do with it," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the Fogg exhibit are two drawings intended for the book but 
suppressed from publication. 
</P>
<P>
The show also includes work done for a reprint of Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur," 
Ben Johnson's "Volpone," Alexander Pope's "The Rape of the Lock," Aristophanes' 
"Lysistrata," and for the periodicals, the Yellow Book and the Savoy. 
</P>
<P>
Drawings for "Bon-Mots," a collection of witticisms are "sort of elaborate 
doodles . . . some quite grotesque," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
A voracious reader, Beardsley sometimes exchanged drawings for books, and it 
was through this that his career was launched when he was chosen to illustrate 
"Le Morte d'Arthur." He was 20. 
</P>
<P>
Some drawings resemble posters and advertisements. "He was of his time, and he 
was not trying to create a lyrical past," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley began writing an erotic novel, but never completed it. He became a 
Roman Catholic the year before he died, and on his death bed asked that some of 
his drawings be destroyed. The publisher who had them did not heed his request. 
</P>
<P>
The Fogg's collection came from alumni who had different reasons for collecting 
Beardsley's work. Grenville L. Winthrop, who was graduated in 1889 and who 
descended from the first governor of Massachusetts, bequeathed to Harvard 23 
original Beardsley drawings among more than 3,700 art objects. 
</P>
<P>
Scofield Thayer, class of 1913 and one-time editor and part-owner of the 
literary review the Dial, had more than 30 drawings that became the Fogg's when 
he died. 
</P>
<P>
Winthrop liked the lines and design of Beardsley's work; Thayer liked the 
daring subject matter, Robinson said.

A BAND NEW PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A REUNION WITH ROBERTSON AND BUSEY'S ENTHUSIASM HAVE RECHARGED RICK DANKO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 12 1/2 years since the legendary Band called it quits, going out in 
style with the equally legendary "Last Waltz" concert. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, songwriter and guitarist Robbie Robertson has pursued film work and 
a solo recording career. Drummer Levon Helm went into acting. Organist Garth 
Hudson fronted a country band and scored movies. Bassist Rick Danko has led his 
own groups and worked on assorted sessions. Pianist Richard Manuel died in an 
apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Though the remaining members have played together in various combinations, 
Robertson has always kept his distance from anything smacking of a Band 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Danko, a surprise jam session with him, Robertson and Hudson 
in April at a tiny Toronto room called the Horseshoe Club changed the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"When Robbie walked out on stage with me, man, a roar went up like the Coliseum 
-- the roof almost came off," said Danko, who is to play three Southland shows 
with Hudson and actor-singer Gary Busey, including Sunday at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The night after the Toronto jam session, the three reunited at Canada's Juno 
Awards for a broadcast of the Band's induction into the Canadian Hall of Fame, 
which included a live performance of "The Weight" (with the Canadian group Blue 
Rodeo) on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
The whole experience was as inspiring for Danko as it was for his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The two of us put our hands together that weekend -- we really had a lot of 
fun," Danko said recently. "As a result, I think Robbie is going to help me 
record this next one." 
</P>
<P>
Danko released his one solo LP, "Rick Danko," on Arista Records 10 years ago, 
but he says promotion and distribution problems soured his enthusiasm to the 
point that he resolved never to do another album. Since 1969 he has lived on a 
150-acre estate in the Catskill Mountains and kept busy touring and performing 
on sessions. His playing is featured on albums by Robert Palmer, Charlie 
Sexton, Robertson and the Del Fuegos, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The Robertson reunion changed his view about solo albums, so he plans to begin 
production in the fall. He said that three labels are interested in the 
project, which will feature all new material, plus a composition by Manuel, 
Gerry Goffin and Carole King called "Breaking New Ground." 
</P>
<P>
"I want this new record to span the entire emotional gauntlet -- something up, 
something down, something sideways," Danko said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like this: The dog has died, the children have grown, and I think it's 
time for me to take this music a little more serious. I'm too young to retire." 
</P>
<P>
After this week's dates, Danko and Hudson are scheduled to play the Soviet 
Union and Italy with John Sebastian, Richie Havens and others as part of a '60s 
entourage entitled "the 69/89 Woodstock Generation Tour." In July, Danko is 
scheduled to open a 30-city tour in Los Angeles with Helm, Dr. John, Joe Walsh 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland shows with Busey and Hudson (they will also be at the Strand in 
Redondo Beach tonight and the Palomino on Friday) came together when Busey 
phoned Danko shortly after the actor's highly publicized motorcycle crash. 
During recovery, Busey spent many hours listening to tapes from gigs that he 
and Danko had performed in years past. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary called me up and told me about how the Grim Reaper had visited him," 
Danko said. "I think the accident kind of alerted him to get back into life and 
pass those gifts along that God has given him. He was so enthusiastic about us 
playing some live music together, it really got my wheels turning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a family kind of show," Danko added. "We're not setting out 
to change the world, just hoping to improve the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Danko, Gary Busey and Garth Hudson play Sunday at 9 p.m. at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano. San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $17.50. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

BLIMP HANGARS AT AIR BASE ARE VAST, EXPENSIVE MONUMENTS TO A BRIEF BUT LOFTY 
DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NIELSEN, John Nielsen is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a county marked increasingly by interchangeable suburbs, the two blimp 
hangars at the Tustin U.S. Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station look like 
something from another world. Officially known as the Lighter Than Air 
Facilities, they are remnants of a brief, bygone era -- an Orange County that's 
been lost. 
</P>
<P>
"You could call them the pyramids of postwar suburban America," said Ray 
Catalano, a UC Irvine professor of social ecology. "I tend to think of them as 
our own unintentional St. Louis arch. A lot of cities spend millions trying to 
build monuments to themselves. Ours are already here." 
</P>
<P>
These 47-year-old monuments show their age and are expensive to maintain, 
however. The Marines have commissioned an independent cost-analysis to begin 
this month that will consider the feasibility of tearing down one hangar. 
</P>
<P>
Because the hangars are historic -- listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places, in fact -- any attempt to remove them would likely create an uproar. 
State and national preservation boards would have to approve of such a plan; 
public hearings would be required. 
</P>
<P>
Such careful deliberation is appropriate, said Maj. Stan Gould, public 
information officer at the base. But he adds that maintenance costs for each 
hangar have risen to an average $200,000 annually. Repairs to both roofs will 
soon add $2 million. And a proposal to refurbish the offices in one hangar 
carries a $14-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
"That's taxpayers' money, and we feel we should use it wisely," Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain: These hangars are big. Each is roughly 1,000 feet long, 
300 feet wide and 180 feet tall. Six Goodyear blimps could easy fit under the 
high, arching roofs. So would at least three copies of Disneyland's Matterhorn. 
So would the Queen Mary, if the forward smokestack was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The hangars saw their heyday in World War II, when they were home to 12 
surveillance blimps that made up Squadron ZP-31 of Fleet Airship Wing 3. The 
290-foot blimps were part of a network of blimp stations on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
Six blimps were assigned to each local hangar. In their 40-by-9-foot cabins 
wedged between the motors, the blimps -- each more than 100 feet longer than 
the Goodyear blimp Columbia -- carried six depth charges, one machine gun and a 
crew of nine. Every day, armed with depth charges, the blimps would chug above 
the Pacific, searching for Japanese submarines. 
</P>
<P>
No submarines were sighted, no guns fired in combat, and the depth charges most 
frequently dropped were aimed at dummy submarines. Although a few blimps 
remained at the base until the early '50s, their era ended with the war. 
</P>
<P>
Today, eight squadrons of Marine helicopters, including the CH-53A/D Sea 
Stallions and CH-46 Sea Knights, are parked in the hangars. The helicopters 
there are among the largest ever built, but inside the hangars they seem like 
bugs. 
</P>
<P>
Catalan's guess is that the hangars will outlast the Marines, but he said the 
corps raises a good point about cost. "Eventually we'll have to ask ourselves 
exactly how much these buildings mean to us," he said. The hangars meant a lot 
in 1942, when the Navy decided to build them on more than 600 acres of Irvine 
Co. bean fields on what was then called Santa Ana Naval Air Station. Hundreds 
of workers were brought to the site, and a special rail spur was extended off 
the Southern Pacific line. To save time, sections of the hangars were cut and 
shaped in Oregon and Washington, then shipped by train to Tustin. To save on 
metal, the ribs of the buildings were built entirely of wood. Each end of the 
ribs was framed with concrete pylons and sunk 150 feet into the bean field. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County historian Jim Sleeper said the hangars went up quickly, though 
not particularly smoothly. One set of pylons listed and had to be replaced. 
Worse, a Santa Ana wind blew over a set of arches one night. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember looking down at the framework that night and seeing it begin to 
sway," said Arthur Guy, an early blimp pilot who is now a Municipal Court judge 
in Fullerton. "As it fell, I heard a tremendous cracking noise like thunder. 
The friction of the bolts against the wood caused it to glow slightly." 
</P>
<P>
The ribs were rebuilt, and as they rose, they formed the framework of the 
largest wood structure in the world, according to the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Cord Meyer, an airship expert and the founding dean of UC Irvine's 
history department, notes the buildings' size: They were big enough to hold the 
800-foot competitors of the soft-skinned blimps: the rigid airships, with 
internal steel skeletons, that had already lost their future several years 
earlier in 1937, when the Hindenburg airship crashed and burned. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a small faction in the Navy that had yet to give up hope on the 
rigid airships," Meyer said. "When the hangars were built, they hedged their 
bets by building them large enough to hold anything. In that sense, the (Santa 
Ana facilities) represent a technological blind alley." 
</P>
<P>
The naval station was decommissioned in 1947, and the hangars were briefly 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Bob Jones, a helicopter pilot assigned to U.S. Marine Corps Heavy 
Helicopter Squadron 361 -- the Flying Tigers -- was standing at attention in 
Lighter Than Air Hangar One when an earthquake rolled through this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We were out there in formation and we all looked up," he said. "You could see 
the rafters swaying and hear the whole thing creak. A couple of nails fell down 
onto the floor. I thought, 'You know, this place is getting old.' " 
</P>
<P>
Inside the buildings, helicopter crews must deal on a daily basis with birds 
dive-bombing unguarded lunches, and feral cats living in the walls. More 
seriously, the wiring is frayed and regularly cuts power, the plumbing is 
decaying, the wood is aging and the roofing is wearing away. 
</P>
<P>
The hangars' deteriorating state is the reason the Marines have commissioned 
Van Dyke &amp; Barnes, a Santa Monica-based architecture and engineering firm, 
to consider whether taxpayers' money might be more wisely spent, Gould said. 
The firm will file its a report in October. 
</P>
<P>
Gould is careful describing the report. "First, it isn't preordained that the 
consultants will recommend that one of the hangars come down," he said. 
"Second, if anything happens, it won't take place for years. Third, these 
buildings are historic monuments, and any action we might take would have to be 
cleared through a range of state and national organizations." 
</P>
<P>
But even with those qualifiers, the thought of what might happen to the hangars 
is sobering to men like Irvin Long, a Huntington Beach resident who helped 
build them. Long, 78, was too old to join the service when the war began. For 
him, building the hangars was a patriotic act and one of the high points of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Every day in the summer of '42, he drove his dump truck to a quarry near 
Placentia, then down through the orchards toward the pair of buildings rising 
on the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd come out into those lima bean fields, and all of a sudden there they 
were," Long said. "I'd never seen anything that big before. 
</P>
<P>
"When we finally finished, I talked the foreman into letting me take a walk on 
the catwalk on top of one of the hangars. I got up there and looked in a 
circle. All you could see was trees and fields and mountains and the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking it was beautiful."

3% RENT INCREASE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Rent Control Board has reversed itself and increased the 
amount by which landlords can raise their rents. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 3 to 2, the board last week rejected its own earlier decision to 
authorize a 2% rent increase and instead will allow rents to go up by 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the board, hearing bitter complaints from landlords, apparently 
became convinced that a 2% increase was unfair and proposed the higher rate. 
Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and member Wayne Bauer stuck to the 2% 
raise but were outvoted. 
</P>
<P>
The increase will take effect in September. Under Santa Monica's stiff rent 
control law, landlords are permitted to raise rents once a year by the amount 
the board decides based on a formula. 
</P>
<P>
A 2% raise would have been the lowest in the 10-year history of the city's rent 
control. Increases have averaged at 4.5% annually for the last decade.

<P>
The Culver City Council voted to authorize $9,180 for the removal and 
replacement of wood play equipment at Culver West, Fox Hills and Blanco parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Human Services and Park Commission found that $150,000 previously budgeted 
for play equipment was insufficient to cover replacement costs for all of the 
city's deteriorated playground structures, such as jungle gyms and monkey bars.

BUDGETS FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Redevelopment Agency this week adopted a $55-million general 
fund budget and a $1-million housing budget for fiscal year 1989-90, which 
begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's general fund budget includes expenditures for traffic improvements 
in the Corporate Pointe area, the acquisition of the Studio Drive-In Theatre 
property and start-up cost for a new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The budget projects revenues of nearly $83 million, with $28 million to be set 
aside as a contingency fund and for new projects. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the agency's 1989-90 housing budget, about $500,000, will cover costs 
related to the construction of the Liberty Plaza housing project for low-income 
senior citizens. Revenues are expected to be $6 million, with the $5-million 
balance set aside for future projects. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is required by state law to set aside 20% of what it takes in from 
taxes and bond issue proceeds for construction of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The agency will hold a public hearing June 19 to determine if its efforts to 
provide low- and moderate-income housing have been enough to meet the city's 
needs.

BLINDING HORRORS;

CAMBODIAN WOMEN'S VISION LOSS LINKED TO SIGHTS OF SLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNETTE KONDO, Annette Kondo is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eang Long cried for many days after the Khmer Rouge soldier beat her brother 
and his three children to death. She vividly recalls how the soldier threw the 
youngest child, a 3-month-old, against a tree until the baby died. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyesight started to get terrible after I saw the tragedy," Long said. 
"Because I was crying so hard and long, my eyes were red and started to swell 
up. Then I started to have problems with my eyesight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trauma From Genocide 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Long, 65, who now lives in Long Beach, still has days when 
shadows -- like silent phantoms of the past -- obscure her vision. She says her 
bifocals do not always help and she fears her eyesight will get worse. 
</P>
<P>
Long and dozens of other middle-aged Cambodian women are coping with a 
condition that some researchers have called "functional blindness" -- blindness 
or visual problems caused by psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
Two researchers who have studied the condition say it is linked to post-war 
trauma stemming from the genocide by Communist leader Pol Pot and the Khmer 
Rouge in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Gretchen Van Boemel, associate director of clinical electro-physiology at the 
Doheny Eye Institute in Los Angeles, says it was 1984 when she started to 
notice a disproportionate number of Cambodian women in the 40-to-60 age group 
who had the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked about this with a friend who was involved in Southeast Asian 
affairs," Van Boemel said, "and she described all the atrocities and killing 
fields in Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, Van Boemel contacted her friend and former college 
classmate Patricia Rozee-Koker, now a psychology professor at Cal State Long 
Beach. By 1985 the two researchers had located a group of 30 Cambodian women, 
ages 40 to 69, who volunteered to be in a study. All of the women had lived in 
Cambodia during the Pol Pot regime and later spent one to six years in a Thai 
refugee camp before being relocated to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Van Boemel said the purpose of the survey was to show that "a psychological 
overlay was causing the women's eye problems, even if the brain was functioning 
normally." 
</P>
<P>
Each woman was interviewed and given an eye exam and a test to determine 
whether the visual system in the brain is functioning normally. Van Boemel said 
the test monitors brain waves as subjects look at checked patterns on a video 
monitor. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the test revealed normal visual acuity, often at the 20/20 or 
20/40 level. These same women, however, when looking at an eye chart could 
barely see the top line of 20/200 -- the point of legal blindness. Other women 
had no light perception and could not detect light or dark shadows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot Years 
</P>
<P>
Rozee-Koker said most of the women's functional blindness surfaced during the 
Pol Pot years. Personal interviews brought out repeated stories of forced 
labor, the murder of family and friends -- often in their presence -- beating 
and torture, starvation, a treacherous escape to Thailand and separation from 
family. 
</P>
<P>
She said the findings indicated that the longer a woman was bound to Khmer 
Rouge servitude or life in a refugee camp, the more her vision was impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the study were presented at the 1986 American Psychological Assn. 
annual meeting in Washington. There was only one other paper about Cambodian 
refugee women and both reports received considerable attention. The paper, "The 
Psychological Effects of War Trauma and Abuse on Older Cambodian Refugee Women" 
is scheduled to appear in a coming issue of the journal Women and Therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the Cambodians do not always understand their 
condition and that many optometrists and ophthalmologists dismiss the vision 
loss as a case of "faking" or "malingering," Van Boemel said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Rozee-Koker pointed to a 1985 piece in the journal 
Ophthalmology. It described new immigrants who might be milking the welfare 
system with complaints of functional blindness. "That article was racist," 
Rozee-Koker said. "But people believe it. It was very insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Nelson, a third-year resident at the UCLA School of Medicine, recently 
completed a preliminary study of Cambodians with functional blindness. "We 
found some patients who had been considered malingerers," he said. "But our 
research proved this to be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexplainable Problems 
</P>
<P>
His findings were confirmed by Long Beach ophthalmologist Hector Sulit, who in 
the last five years has noticed a significant number of Cambodian women with 
unexplainable visual problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it has anything to do with their age, but (it is) because they 
lost family or children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As more data about functional blindness in the Cambodian community became 
available, Rozee-Koker and Van Boemel decided to continue their study. 
</P>
<P>
This fall they completed a 10-week study of 15 Long Beach Cambodian women. Each 
Saturday the women participated in a therapy or skills group for 90 minutes. 
The therapy group uncovered deep post-war trauma. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic improvement took place in the skills group. As the women 
mastered such basic skills as taking a bus downtown, using a telephone and 
shopping, they felt a growing sense of empowerment over their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Or as one Cambodian woman told Rozee-Koker: "When I am happy I see better." 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing to see the difference," Rozee-Koker said. "From having to be 
guided by our arms into the elevator to the psychology building or holding 
themselves in a fetal position -- to the last week when they were standing up 
straight. Many could smile and with some, their vision improved." 
</P>
<P>
For Chhou Chreng, 64, the sessions were an opportunity to learn how to dial 911 
and to brush up on writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my vision in an accident in 1979," she said. "Something fell on my head 
and then things were not clear." Under Pol Pot she was forced to work in the 
rice fields for four years. Her husband, brother and many cousins died of 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I will get a headache if I think about my sister in Cambodia," she 
said. "Then I will get pain all over my body and my eyes will hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Both researchers, who are compiling their data, acknowledge that 10 weeks is 
not enough time to deal with these bouts of depression. Next year they hope to 
start a student intern program at Cal State Long Beach that will assist local 
Cambodian women. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Community Rehabilitation Industries also works with Cambodian 
women. Konthea Kang, a program coordinator at CRI, estimates that up to 20% to 
30% of the dozens of Cambodian women she sees have had visual loss symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Older women, she said, have a more difficult time assimilating into American 
life styles. In Cambodia, most young people take care of their elderly 
relatives and parents. In rural areas, she said, women stay at home and raise 
families and many urban husbands also frown upon wives who work. 
</P>
<P>
When these women reach the United States, they are strongly encouraged by 
federal and state agencies to find a job. But in the workplace, they encounter 
yet another problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When they can't speak English, they don't know what to do and get laid off," 
Kang said. "After this they feel lost for several months." 
</P>
<P>
As a counselor at the Asian Pacific Mental Health Center in Long Beach, the 
Rev. Kong Chhean said he tries to help his patients become more secure. The 
counselor and Buddhist monk has a caseload of about eight women with visual 
dysfunction symptoms. They are tormented by frequent nightmares about the Khmer 
Rouge and are still afraid of attacks, even though they are far from the 
soldiers who hunted them. 
</P>
<P>
Although light is being shed on functional blindness, experts say that 
successful treatment is often tied to mental health care and that poses a 
problem in the Cambodian community. 
</P>
<P>
Kung Chap, a vocational rehabilitation counselor at the Long Beach office of 
the California Department of Rehabilitation, said the concept of mental health 
care in Cambodia is negative. A mental health facility in Phnon Penh called 
Takhmao Hospital "looks like a jail," he said. "The people there are labeled as 
crazy people. They would have been beaten and electric shock used on them." 
</P>
<P>
Cambodians, Chap said, would rather seek help from the family, a temple or a 
shaman with magic cures. They are slow to accept the American style of 
counseling and therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Rozee-Koker and Van Boemel have also found Cambodians to be afraid of agencies, 
hospitals and the university. On one occasion they made an appointment to 
interview a woman and her family at home. When they got to the house, the 
entire family had and moved. 
</P>
<P>
"We had evoked memories of the Khmer Rouge," Rozee-Koker said. "To them it was 
a voice of authority. To their minds it sounded like Pol Pot." 
</P>
<P>
The refugees, Rozee-Koker said, will carry the scars of their experiences 
throughout their lives. "They do not want to see any more violence, any more 
pain. They have essentially closed their eyes to it." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Chhou Chreng put, it, "When I feel happy my eyes are normal. When I 
think about Cambodia and my family I see flashes of light and dark."

Q: We have two adorable cats, neither of which particularly cares for the other 
and no doubt would dislike a dog even more. Nevertheless, we eventually would 
like to add a puppy to our family. Any suggestions on which breed is most 
kindly disposed to cats? At this time we are thinking about a large dog (such 
as a husky or collie), but are worried that our two de-clawed felines would be 
miserable and defenseless. 
</P>

<P>
A: Introducing any puppy to your two cats will probably upset their day, yet 
will be the best way to add a dog to your household. A puppy will generally be 
non-threatening although it could be annoying from their point of view. Since 
your cats are de-clawed, the risk of injury to the pup is greatly reduced. You 
need to be present during the initial introductions in order to keep the pup 
from being too bold and possibly getting hurt if he should corner one of the 
cats while trying to play. Allow the cats some "high ground" to retreat toward 
while they are adjusting to the pup. It may take them several months to feel 
comfortable around the pup. It's possible they may never completely accept the 
dog in spite of what you do. Since you are planning on getting a large dog, it 
will probably spend most of its time outdoors and not be in competition with 
the cats for house space. Some cats may start to spray in the house until they 
finally accept the dog, so be prepared for some behavioral modifications. 
</P>

Q: I have a 3-year-old cat that is an indoor/outdoor pet. Lately he has several 
areas where he is losing his hair. My roommate says he may have mange and that 
I may have to get rid of him or put him to sleep. Is this necessary? Can't I 
use one of the dips in the store to treat the mange? 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Tolmasov, Orange 
</P>
<P>
A: Hair loss on a cat or dog does not always mean that they have mange. There 
is more than one type of mange, each caused by a different kind of mite and 
each treated differently. Hair loss can be due to a fungus, a wound, scratching 
at fleas, metabolic diseases and hormonal changes. It would be worth the peace 
of mind to take your cat to your veterinarian and have it examined and treated. 
Don't assume that dipping your cat will help the problem.

MEXICAN HORSEMEN RIDE HIGH AT RODEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Manuel Escobedo, atop a galloping palomino, thundered alongside a fleeing steer 
and seized its tail barehanded. But the steer slipped his grasp and dashed off, 
its dignity intact. 
</P>
<P>
"No luck for Manuel Escobedo," an announcer boomed in Spanish over loudspeakers 
to a few dozen spectators in the grandstands. Escobedo, disappointed that the 
steer had not fallen, trotted off while a ragtag brass band pumped out an 
energetic Mexican march. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene straight out of a Mexican rancho. One would never guess that 
this was really Saugus, just three miles up a canyon road from a burgeoning 
suburban housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whitewashed Ring 
</P>
<P>
But for six months, 20 to 30 horsemen have gathered each Sunday afternoon at a 
whitewashed riding ring in San Francisquito Canyon to test their horses and 
their skills in the classic Mexican rodeo or charreada. 
</P>
<P>
For just a few hours, Saugus is transformed into Zacatecas, Durango or Jalisco, 
all Mexican states rich in the traditions of the Mexican cowboy or charro. The 
weekly events are a chance, said Escobedo, "to conserve our Mexican culture." 
</P>
<P>
The arena was built along San Francisquito Canyon Road a year ago by Leonardo 
Lopez, an Encino resident and owner of a chain of Mexican restaurants. 
Originally from the Mexican state of Durango, Lopez, 39, also heads an 
association of charros, which includes horsemen from the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and neighboring valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The ring has become a regular stopping place for some of the 27 other charro 
associations in the state. For a $6 fee, fans can cheer and jeer the charros 
and listen to a brass band or mariachis. A few extra dollars buys beer and 
tacos. Those unwilling to pay sometimes park their trucks on a nearby bluff 
and, standing on the roofs, watch the proceedings from afar. 
</P>
<P>
The rodeos have not gone without criticism. Some neighbors have complained 
about the band music that fills San Francisquito Canyon each Sunday. Some 
spectators have blocked driveways with their cars or dumped litter. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are pretty careless about throwing away their beer cans," said 
Linda Cullen, who lives on the 80-acre Lady Linda Ranch next door. But, Cullen 
added, Lopez has responded to the complaints. "It's improved since they first 
came out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday, the ever-present announcer promised a sparse crowd that 
"these charreadas are 100% Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pork Simmering 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, that's true. Spanish was the language of the day, and the 
tempting aroma of carnitas -- pork simmering in a big black caldron -- 
overpowered the smell of corrals. 
</P>
<P>
But the charreadas, through an appealing mix of American mass culture and 
Mexican tradition, offered reminders that this really was Saugus. Two fans in 
the grandstands recorded the competition on videotape. A little boy twirling a 
lasso wore a Western shirt, chaps -- and a Boston Red Sox cap. While most 
charros swigged Budweiser, one sipped Perrier. 
</P>
<P>
The events in the charreada, however, have not been changed and differ from 
those in American rodeos. While cowboys ride bulls and broncos one-handed for a 
maximum eight seconds, charros use two hands and hold on until they give out or 
the animals give up. 
</P>
<P>
Only Mexicans perform the coleadero, a feat in which points are awarded for 
sending a charging steer tumbling with a yank on the tail. The points vary, 
depending on where and how the animal falls down. Charros can even lose points 
for a bad performance. The scoring is so complicated, the charros said, judges 
often keep an open rule book at their side. 
</P>
<P>
Animal activists have branded the coleadero and other charreada events as 
inhumane to animals. But on a recent Sunday in Saugus, the steers seemed to be 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Escobedo was the fourth charro to fail in the coleadero. Seven more 
tried without success. Some never touched the tail. "Zero points for Ruben 
Gutierrez," blared the loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th rider up was Fernando Lopez, the 11-year-old son of Leonardo Lopez. 
Perhaps by accident, or perhaps as a joke, he was sent after the largest steer 
of the day, a muscular animal of mottled brown and black. He held the tail 
briefly before letting go. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando later recalled that once, at a different charreada, a steer actually 
went down after he tugged its tail. "That was luck," he said. "It tripped over 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando would have no such luck on this day. It seemed that neither would 
anyone else. The steers outwitted three riders after him. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, charro Rodrigo Barunda snatched a steer's tail and wrapped it around 
his outstretched right leg. The steer pulled right, but Barunda pulled left. 
The steer went down and the crowd cheered. Even the spectators on the nearby 
bluff applauded. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard work. Risky, too. "They can lose fingers," Escobedo said. In the 
world of charros, "Everything is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Tradition 
</P>
<P>
Escobedo, like most of the charros, is originally from Mexico. A ruggedly 
handsome man of 42, he learned to ride on a ranch in Zacatecas. As his father 
had taught him, he is teaching his own son, Esteban, 10, to rope and ride. "He 
rides well," he said with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of the charreada is understandable for Escobedo and other Mexican 
immigrants. The rodeo is the national sport of Mexico and charros have been 
long celebrated in songs, movies and on television. So, just as the charreada 
transforms Saugus into a slice of Jalisco, the weekly event also transforms 
ordinary men into the dashing Mexican equivalent of John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Gerardo Gandara, 29, a native of Zacatecas living in Sylmar. During 
the week, he is a truck driver. But on horseback, the stocky man is 
surprisingly agile and graceful, completely in control. The tiny crowd cheered 
as Gandara skillfully roped a sprinting mare. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that the Saugus charros perform to hear the roar of the crowd. 
The grandstands could hold more than 100, but sometimes just 60 people attend. 
Sometimes 40. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, nobody," said a guard at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendly Competition 
</P>
<P>
The small crowd does not discourage the riders. "This is nothing more than 
practice," Escobedo said. And, although the announcer awarded points for 
well-performed feats, nobody kept score. "This is a friendly competition," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the state's charro associations sometimes compete for titles. But, 
often enough, they ride just for the sake of riding. James H. Nottage, chief 
curator of the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park, said 
charros traditionally have savored their sport not for awards, but for the 
demands it places on man and beast. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1800s, Mexican cowboys in California sometimes would rope grizzly bears 
"as a matter of sport," Nottage said. "Of course, it was a very risky 
competition."

DATA LINK CANCER, TOXICS; 13 CALIFORNIA PLANTS ON LIST 
</P>

<P>
Environmental Protection Agency data released today by a House panel chairman 
indicate that 205 industrial plants in 37 states release enough toxic chemicals 
to pose a severe cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen plants in California were on the list. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials cautioned that while the overall cancer danger is serious, the 
information includes partial and old data that does not represent "credible 
estimates of risk" for individual facilities cited. 
</P>
<P>
Risk estimates for those exposed are a thousand-fold greater than the cancer 
risk level most policy makers consider acceptable, said Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Calif.), who released the figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Risk 
</P>
<P>
Only one plant in the nation, a Texaco refinery at Port Neches, Tex., was 
listed as posing a cancer risk of at least 1 in 10 for each person given 
maximum exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Two California plants, Simpson Paper Co. of Fairhaven and Unocal at La Mirada, 
were in the second section of the list for posing a cancer risk of at least 1 
in 100 but less than 10 in 100. There were 45 such plants listed nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The third category of plants with a cancer risk of at least 1 in 1,000 but less 
than 1 in 100 for each person with maximum exposure includes 11 California 
plants: Dow Chemical, Pittsburg (listed twice because of risks from two 
chemicals); Louisiana Pacific, Samoa; Louisiana Pacific, Antioch; Simpson 
Paper, Anderson; Shell-Carlson, Los Angeles; American Pharmaceutical, 
Irwindale; Cal-Compack Food, Santa Ana; Gilroy Foods Inc., Gilroy; McCormick 
&amp; Co., Salinas; Micro-Biotrol, Vernon, and Santa Maria Chili, Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
A risk estimate of 1 in 1,000 means that one person out of 1,000 could be 
expected to contract cancer from maximum exposure to a single pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee, 
agreed that the list could change because the figures are preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, the numbers represent a "stunning demonstration of the 
urgency of the public health threat" from the now-unregulated toxic emissions, 
and he told reporters that the public has a right to the information. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the new, preliminary list is the first of its kind, although 
Waxman noted that two previous studies found cancer rates two to four times the 
national average near some major chemical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
There are strong indications that the risk is even worse because the data are 
so limited, Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the information only measures cancer risks, but not other 
potential hazards such as birth defects, nervous system damage or respiratory 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman coupled release of the data with introduction of legislation to control 
toxic releases from industrial sources and motor vehicles; to prevent 
accidental releases; to protect the Great Lakes, which have been seriously 
damaged by airborne toxic chemicals, and to control emissions from small 
businesses.

<P>
Hard-line Premier Li Peng made a triumphal reappearance today as China's 
Communist Party launched a crackdown on dissent, calling pro-democracy 
activists dangerous "counterrevolutionaries" and urging people to inform on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of the capital, under martial law imposed by Li three weeks ago, 
appeared calm. But despite the outward easing of tension thousands of 
foreigners continued to flee the city. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest indication so far that the hard-line officials were prevailing 
came with a film report on the evening television news of Premier Li addressing 
what was described as "a certain martial-law unit." 
</P>
<P>
An ebullient Li, wearing an austere Mao suit, was shown being lustily cheered 
by soldiers after he said: 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the State Council (China's Cabinet), I bring you greetings. I 
hope you will continue to work hard to preserve peace and order in the 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
Li has been widely reviled in China and abroad for calling on troops to smash a 
peaceful protest. But he looked fit and confident, apparently giving the lie to 
a Hong Kong newspaper report that he had been wounded in an assassination 
attempt by a policeman whose relatives were killed in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clues to Zhao's Ouster 
</P>
<P>
Further signs that the nominal Communist Party general secretary, the reformist 
Zhao Ziyang, had been ousted came with a series of hard-line announcements from 
party, government and martial-law organs. 
</P>
<P>
The party's Discipline Inspection Commission ordered the 47 million party 
members to combat what it called a "counterrevolutionary threat." 
</P>
<P>
The State Council said the national rail system is at risk from saboteurs. It 
said security personnel had been authorized to use "all methods" to protect 
rail communications. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Beijing city government and the martial-law command decreed that the 
unofficial student and worker unions, which played a key role in this year's 
campaign for democracy, are "counterrevolutionary organizations." 
</P>
<P>
The television repeatedly broadcast telephone numbers for callers to use to 
inform on union members, designated as counterrevolutionary rioters. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh martial-law troops moved into central areas of Beijing today, replacing 
units of the reviled 27th Army, which spearheaded the brutal assault early 
Sunday on thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Although the newly arrived soldiers are still heavily armed, the change of 
faces seemed to reassure a frightened populace. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens came out into the streets to discuss the weekend carnage in which 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, were shot or crushed to death by tanks and armored 
personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers, on their best behavior, listened to the tales of horror. Many had the 
same response: "Judge us by our actions." 
</P>
<P>
The new, softer military approach in the capital, after days in which wild-eyed 
soldiers shot up tourist hotels and diplomatic apartments, and the day's volley 
of political directives prompted some analysts to speculate that China's 
feuding leaders had reached a compromise to cool a dangerous situation that 
many feared was spiraling into civil war.

2 TODDLERS KILLED IN BLAZE AT HOME DAY CARE FACILITY; 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH FIRE INJURES 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two toddlers were killed and two other children and their baby-sitter were 
injured today in a fire that swept through a home day care facility in 
Huntington Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not immediately release the names of the children but said that the 
two who died were both 18 months old. One of the surviving youngsters was taken 
to UCI Medical Center in Orange in serious condition with second- and 
third-degree burns, while the other child was taken to Humana Hospital in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving children were identified as boys, one 2 and the other 4. 
</P>
<P>
According to Huntington Beach police spokesperson Martha Werth, the fire broke 
out at the single-story stucco home at 5122 Audrey Drive shortly before 10 a.m. 
and quickly engulfed the home in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the baby-sitter, identified as Pat Orozco, 49, ran out of the 
house with a child in her arms and went back inside in an attempt to rescue the 
others. Orozco was hospitalized at UCI Medical Center, but authorities said her 
injuries were not serious. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a baby in her arms, and they both had burns," said Kevin Mohl, 26, a 
Huntington Beach resident who drove by the house shortly after the fire broke 
out. "She was going crazy. She was trying to get the babies out. She was going 
into hysterics." 
</P>
<P>
Before fire units arrived, witnesses said several people tried to dash into the 
burning house to rescue the children. One of the would-be rescuers was an 
unidentified city water employee who groped his way through the smoke inside 
but could not find the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"He went in and got three or four stuffed animals out, then the roof 
collapsed," said David Hansen, an Arrowhead Water employee who watched the 
rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they did not know what caused the fire, but witnesses said 
it appeared that most of the damage was in the rear of the house, where one 
room was gutted by flames and part of the ceiling collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The dead toddlers were found by firemen, who arrived at the scene just minutes 
after the blaze started. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Breen, coastal vice president of the Orange County Day Care Assn., said 
her records indicated that the Orozco facility was licensed and in good 
standing with the county Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
The fire department immediately set up a crisis center to console the 
youngsters' parents once they arrived. It was not known whether any of the 
children were related to each other.

The United States is partly to blame for a huge influx of Vietnamese boat 
people into Hong Kong, a relief official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bale, Hong Kong director of the British-based charity organization Oxfam, 
said Washington had applied pressure on Southeast Asian nations to provide 
asylum to boat people fleeing Vietnam but then failed to resettle enough of 
them in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bale told a news conference that Washington must accept that eventual mandatory 
repatriation of many boat people to Vietnam is the only solution. 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials are telling Asians: "No, no, you can't send them back to 
Vietnam because that's a nasty Communist regime. But on the other hand, we're 
not going to resettle them." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "They can't have it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has more than 41,000 boat people crowded into camps and detention 
centers and says it is no longer able to cope with the influx.

<P>
A British army officer in West Germany confined 200 of his men to barracks for 
three days after discovering a scratch on his station wagon, the Defense 
Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Rod Brummitt issued the order to all the unmarried soldiers under his 
command at Hamer, near Dortmund, in an effort to find the man who scratched the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry was commenting on a report of the incident in the Sun newspaper 
headlined "Colonel Crackpot." 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid quoted one of Brummitt's men as saying: "The damage to his car 
wasn't all that great. And why did he pick on the single soldiers (when) anyone 
in the regiment could have done it?" 
</P>

The Beijing Hotel, the oldest and largest in the capital and a focal point of 
this week's Chinese army assault on pro-democracy demonstrators, closed today 
until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who tried to enter were told that it was empty, accepting no guests 
and that its restaurants and shops were closed. It ran out of food two days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Avenue of Eternal Peace about 400 yards east of Tian An Men 
Square, the hotel provided a grandstand view of tanks and troops as they moved 
to and from the square and city center. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists took over some of its 1,000 rooms when tourists beat a 
hasty retreat as the brutal attack began Saturday night. But by Wednesday, 
security men had covered the windows of rooms occupied by journalists to stop 
them from watching military activity.

KY. SCHOOL SYSTEM REVAMP ORDERED; 
</P>
<P>
RULING FINDS EDUCATION SPENDING GAP UNCONSTITUTIONAL

<P>
The state Supreme Court ruled today that Kentucky's school system is 
unconstitutional because of the spending gap between rich and poor districts, 
and it ordered the Legislature to produce a new setup. 
</P>
<P>
The court, ruling 5 to 1 with a seventh justice partly concurring and partly 
dissenting, gave the Legislature until the end of its 1990 session to come up 
with a system to even out spending. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not direct the General Assembly to raise taxes. It is their decision how 
best to achieve efficiency," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the court said the Legislature -- in what would be a major departure 
-- must make local tax rates uniform. 
</P>
<P>
A frequent criticism is that poor districts often make only token efforts to 
help themselves, with minimal tax rates and lax enforcement of collections. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed in 1985 by 66 "property-poor" 
districts. The suit alleged that the school finance system, which depends on 
property taxes, is not fair in a state where wealth varies widely, from the 
Appalachian coal fields in eastern Kentucky to the affluent Cincinnati suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
A judge agreed in 1988 that the Legislature had failed to meet its obligation 
under the Kentucky Constitution to establish an equitable system of public, or 
common, schools in terms of either spending or quality. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court largely upheld the judge's finding, ruling "This 
obligation cannot be shifted to local counties and local school districts." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Wallace Wilkinson lauded the ruling. "We have the opportunity to rebuild, 
to redefine education in Kentucky. And if we fail, we will have failed 
ourselves, our fellow Kentuckians and particularly our children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. John Brock said today was "the happiest day of my professional 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"Today the court has propelled us from the 19th Century to the 21st," he said.

ROSTENKOWSKI MAY ACCEPT DEAL ON CAPITAL-GAINS TAX 
</P>

<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, who traditionally has viewed the capital-gains tax 
preference as the ultimate plaything of the rich, is signaling a change of 
heart may be on the way -- if the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
The price might require President Bush to back away from his campaign pledge 
not to raise taxes. Even in that unlikely event, some members of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, which Rostenkowski chairs, said today that they would be 
reluctant to accept any such bargain, even as part of a deficit-reduction 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, however, Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is indicating a willingness to 
at least discuss the question with Bush, a former committee colleague. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't like a lower tax rate for capital gains," an aide to Rostenkowski 
insisted today. "But could it ever be acceptable? The answer is yes -- if the 
President offered in return something so attractive to Democrats that they 
couldn't turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
The aide said he is not sure that Rostenkowski's position has changed all that 
much. Despite a long record of criticizing the capital-gains benefit, 
Rostenkowski "never says never," the staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 80% of the tax cut 
under Bush's capital-gains proposal would go to those with incomes of more than 
$100,000 a year.

TV PROGRAM WITH ADS TO BE OFFERED TO SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE NEXT YEAR

Whittle Communications, already under fire from national education groups, said 
today that it plans to offer its commercially sponsored Channel One news 
program for teen-agers to schools nationwide starting next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The media company based in Knoxville, Tenn., said it has modified its original 
plans for the service and intends to make two additional channels of 
educational programming available to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel One project had come under fire from many national education groups 
and other officials because it meant students would be compelled to view 
advertising during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
California School Supt. Bill Honig, saying "our students' minds aren't for 
sale," warned that state public schools accepting the program would be docked 
for time students spent watching it. 
</P>
<P>
But Chairman Christopher Whittle, saying he had listened to the criticism, said 
schools that sign up for Channel One will be able to have only some -- rather 
than all -- of their classrooms wired to receive the program. And he said 
students would not be required to watch. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan, tested in six schools, was to show the program to the entire 
student body every day. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Whittle said schools that participate still will be obliged to 
show the daily 12-minute news program with the two minutes of ads in those 
classrooms with the Channel One equipment every school day. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Channel One service, Whittle said his company will donate 
1,000 hours of satellite time every school year for non-commercial educational 
programming to be carried on a new channel called the Classroom Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The Classroom Channel would be run by a board independent of Whittle 
Communications that would decide how it would be operated. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle said it was likely the board would decide against allowing advertising 
on that service. Schools could pick and choose what they want to use from that 
channel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Whittle Communications would donate $500,000 a year for the board to 
acquire rights to programming for the Classroom Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle said he was also developing a third network, the Educators Channel, 
that would carry programming designed for educators.

The European Community today imposed a permanent ban on baby sealskin imports. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced at a meeting of EC environment ministers in Luxembourg, 
delighted a crowd of about 100 animal welfare demonstrators from all over the 
12-nation community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're terribly happy. It's the best we could have hoped for," said Enid Homard 
of Britain, who belongs to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 
</P>
<P>
A six-year EC import ban on the skins of harp and hooded seal pups, due to 
expire Oct. 1, was made permanent to help protect the species from extinction. 
The skins are sold as luxury fur goods in the West.

U.S. investment in factories and equipment is expected to increase a revised 
6.5% in 1989, slightly higher than previously estimated, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Based on surveys of businesses conducted in April and May, the department 
projected 1989 real capital spending will rise to a seasonally adjusted $451.43 
billion from a revised $423.69 billion in 1988, when spending jumped a sharp 
10.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The department estimated in April that real capital spending would rise 6.3% in 
1989, based on surveys in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the projection would result in the third annual increase in capital 
spending, the rise would be smaller than last year's gain and appears in line 
with other recent government data that show the economy is slowing.

a.m. on a west Houston street after a patrolman saw him traveling at 50 m.p.h. 
in a 35-m.p.h. zone and weaving so badly he "almost went over the sidewalk," an

The Major League Baseball Players Assn. has filed a grievance on behalf of 
former Atlanta Braves outfielder Albert Hall, who was released this spring 
after he voluntarily sought treatment for alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The grievance charges that the release was without cause and seeks 
reinstatement to the Braves for Hall, who signed a minor-league contract with 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 23 and has since played for their Class AAA 
affiliate in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 31, entered an Atlanta rehabilitation clinic Feb. 21 for treatment of 
alcohol dependency. After completing the 28-day program, Hall joined the team 
in West Palm Beach on March 22, eight days before the club left spring 
training. He appeared in two games as a pinch-runner and never had an at-bat 
before being given his unconditional release March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Hall would have earned $250,000 this year but the Braves absolved themselves of 
Hall's contract upon releasing him.

HARD-PRESSED GRAF BEATS 15-YEAR-OLD

Defending champion Steffi Graf, pushed to the limit by the tournament's 
youngest player, outlasted 15-year-old Monica Seles 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 today to 
reach the French Open women's final. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, an unseeded Florida-based Yugoslav with smashing ground strokes on both 
her forehand and backhand, gave Graf her toughest match in a Grand Slam 
tournament for more than a year as she forced the West German into a stream of 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
In the final Saturday, Graf will meet 17-year-old Arantxa Sanchez, the first 
Spanish woman ever to reach the championship match at Stade Roland Garros. 
Sanchez, the No. 6 seed, downed Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami -- fourth-round 
conqueror of Gabriela Sabatini -- 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez only had to keep the ball in play to make it to the final. Fernandez 
made a catalogue of elementary errors and hardly hit a winner as she was blown 
away in an unspectacular match that lasted one hour, 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Graf-Seles match was full of thrills. 
</P>
<P>
Going for the lines on almost every point, Seles stopped Graf from getting into 
her usual attacking groove and stayed with the world's No. 1 player until 3-3 
in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the last three games did Seles' hopes of pulling off one of the 
greatest upsets in women's tennis evaporate. She dropped her serve to go down 
5-3 and Graf, relaxing for the first time, served out the match at love. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really satisfied," said Seles, who was playing her first Grand Slam event 
and had eliminated two seeded players, Zina Garrison and Manuela Maleeva. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter I lost. I'm proud of myself. To tell the truth, all through 
the match I didn't think I could win," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe just a little bit, when it was 2-1, 30-love in the third set, I thought 
I might have a little chance, but when I started to think about it, my hands 
started shaking." 
</P>
<P>
Seles did far better than that, becoming the first player since Sabatini in the 
final of the U.S. Open eight months ago to take a set off Graf in any of the 
world's four major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing pretty badly; I wasn't scared of her," Graf said. "Sometimes you 
have good days and bad days. Today was not my day at all. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the tournament, Seles had attracted more attention than any other 
woman player because of her age, colorful costumes, bubbly personality and 
devastating base-line game. The confrontation between the new young star and 
the world champion was one of the most eagerly awaited of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez has met Graf in two semifinals this season already, at Amelia Island, 
Fla., and Hilton Head, N.C., winning a total of 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got nothing to lose now," said Sanchez, who has reached the semifinals of 
all eight clay court tournaments she has competed in this season. "I'm playing 
the No. 1 player in the world. I'll just try to play my game."
