JUDGE IN HUNTER CASE SAYS TRIAL MAY LAST INTO OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge hearing the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud case has told jurors that the 
trial will probably last through September and possibly into October. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam made the announcement Thursday to the 
jury, which earlier had been told that the trial would probably end in July. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement may mean that the trial could recess for several weeks in the 
summer to accommodate jurors' vacations, but that has not been decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys could not comment about the announcement because of a gag order 
imposed by Gilliam a month ago against talking with the press. But, before the 
gag order was issued, Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo told the judge that 
Hunter's attorneys were spending an unusually long time in cross-examining 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the lengthy trial involving 234 counts began in late March, 
and testimony started in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony continued Friday from investors who lost money when the J. David 
&amp; Co. investment house collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Crain, a former political science professor at San Diego State 
University, testified this week that Hunter's role in the firm was "one of the 
major influences" causing him to invest $25,000 in J. David Banking. 
</P>
<P>
"She was well known to me as an active member of the Democratic Party . . . 
(and as) mayor of Del Mar," Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from Richard Marmaro, one of Hunter's defense 
attorneys, Crain said he thought Hunter was reputable and respected, as well as 
a top executive in J. David. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is facing the 234 counts stemming from her alleged participation in the 
giant Ponzi scheme masterminded by J. David (Jerry) Dominelli. When the J. 
David firm went bankrupt in February, 1984, 1,500 people had lost $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying this week was Bert Wahlen, a major J. David investor who at the 
time was a vice president at Group W broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Wahlen testified that he had difficulty obtaining information as to why his 
account was not faring as well as a friend's, but that Hunter explained to him 
there "were cycles in the business." Wahlen said the discussion influenced his 
decision to keep his money in the account. 
</P>
<P>
Wahlen said he met with Hunter once because he had the names of some potential 
investors. However, she never contacted him to follow up on the tips, he 
testified.

PROSECUTOR FINDS NO GROUNDS TO TRY OCEANSIDE OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A special prosecutor hired by the city of Oceanside will not seek charges 
against Councilman Sam Williamson, who was accused by a political adversary of 
violating the city's campaign ordinance during his reelection bid last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
After completing a seven-month investigation this week, Beatrice Kemp, a former 
state deputy attorney general, said on Friday that there was insufficient 
evidence to prove that the second-term councilman "willfully and knowingly" 
violated the campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance demands that I prove he had demonstrated specific intent to 
violate the campaign rules," Kemp said. "I looked at each of the allegations 
and determined that I would not be able to amass enough evidence to prove there 
was willful and knowing violation of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on that determination, I decided not to prosecute," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflict of Interest Cited 
</P>
<P>
Kemp was hired after City Atty. Charles Revlett removed his office from the 
case, citing a conflict of interest because of his familiarity with Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
After he won reelection, Williamson was accused by Jim Willis, a rival 
candidate, of failing to accurately disclose campaign donations and accepting 
contributions exceeding the limits set by the city's campaign law. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp declined to discuss the details of allegations made against Williamson and 
said: "I don't see any reason to go line-by-line. Overall, I determined there 
was not enough evidence to prosecute. I'm not going to talk about specifics." 
</P>
<P>
But Kemp said there was no evidence that Williamson received contributions 
exceeding the city limits. At times, however, the councilman did fail to report 
donations in a timely manner, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Listing Ralley Late 
</P>
<P>
"For example, the cruise (a rally held on a charter boat to kick off 
Williamson's campaign) was in July, but the report listing that item was filed 
in January," Kemp said. "In between that time, three reports were filed. Did he 
follow the strict letter of the law? No." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the investigation, Kemp hinted that ambiguous language in the 
ordinance could make prosecution difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson denied the allegations when they surfaced. The statute, adopted in 
May, 1988, established campaign reporting requirements and curbed contributions 
by an individual or an organization. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance states that no person can contribute more than $250 to a 
candidate, and that no political action committee or any other organization can 
give more than $500 to any candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Ill Feelings Toward Anybody' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any ill feelings toward anybody," said Williamson, after his 
exoneration. "I realize accusations were made, and as false as they were, I 
realize the process demands that they be checked out. And it's been proven that 
they were strictly untrue." 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence to substantiate charges that Williamson undervalued the 
non-monetary contributions of the charter boat cruise and rental of his 
campaign headquarters in a campaign disclosure form, according to Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson had been accused of undervaluing items so that they would fall 
within the limits of the campaign ordinance.

DEFENSE-FRAUD PROBE TARGET RETIRES FROM CUBIC CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cubic Corp. executive Colvin C. (Sam) Wellborn, whose offices were searched by 
the FBI in the government's continuing investigation into defense procurement 
fraud, Friday retired after 32 years with Cubic. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic has acknowledged that Wellborn, 56, is a target of the "Ill Wind" fraud 
investigation that has touched several government employees and executives at 
nearly 30 defense-contracting firms. 
</P>
<P>
Seven federal agents took a 6-inch stack of documents from Wellborn's San Diego 
office after a six-hour search last June. Wellborn and several other Cubic 
employees since have been subpoenaed, evidently as part of an investigation 
into the "Top Gun" air combat training systems that account for the bulk of 
Cubic's Defense Department contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Targets 
</P>
<P>
Joseph J. Aronica, an assistant U. S. attorney in Virginia and one of the top 
prosecutors in the Ill Wind investigations, said Friday that Cubic and Wellborn 
remain targets of the investigation. Aronica declined to say when charges would 
be brought, but he described the timing of Wellborn's resignation as "very, 
very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Cubic spokesman Jerry Reeves declined to comment on whether Wellborn's 
retirement was related to the Justice Department's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, two Teledyne Electronics officials were given light 
sentences for their part in a scheme to bribe a Navy official to win a 
$24-million electronics contract. The two executives were the first defendants 
found guilty at trial in the Ill Wind investigation. So far, 14 individuals and 
two corporations have confessed to or been found guilty of crimes uncovered in 
the three-year inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denial Made 
</P>
<P>
Although Cubic Chairman Walter J. Zable has acknowledged that Wellborn is a 
target of the investigation, he has denied that the Justice Department 
considers Cubic itself to be a target. 
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Department documents released by a federal court in 
Maryland, Wellborn allegedly paid a top Air Force civilian official for 
illegally obtained information that Cubic subsequently used to pursue at least 
three Defense Department contracts. The document alleged that Wellborn and the 
Air Force official engaged in "continuing criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
In a January letter to employees, Zable argued that Wellborn "deserves respect 
for his service, recognition of his rights and support for the presumption of 
innocence with which he is clothed." 
</P>
<P>
Wellborn most recently served as a Cubic Corp. senior vice president and as 
president of Cubic's Defense Systems subsidiary. He joined Cubic in 1957 as a 
design engineer. Cubic Defense Systems accounted for about 42% of Cubic's $364 
million in 1988 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Service Cited 
</P>
<P>
Zable on Friday credited Wellborn with "32 years of dedicated, loyal and 
productive service to Cubic. He will be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
Separate from the Ill Wind investigation, two Cubic employees are now being 
tried in U. S. District Court on charges of defrauding the government in 
connection with a contract to produce hand-held mine detectors. They have 
pleaded not guilty. Last year, Cubic agreed to pay the Army $7.5 million to 
settle a civil complaint against the company in connection with the 
mine-detector contract. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of disgruntled shareholders late last year filed a civil suit against 
Cubic, alleging fraudulent activity by Cubic executives and officers in 
connection with the defense procurement investigation and the mine detector 
case.

GRAND JURY INDICTS 10 MORE IN LARGEST U.S. METH LAB STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury in San Diego has issued a 14-count indictment charging 10 
more people with the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine in the 
aftermath of a nine-month inter-agency sting operation that authorities have 
billed as the largest of its kind in U.S. history, officials reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The death of a 21-year-old woman is also involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment issued Thursday alleges that the group conspired to manufacture 
800 pounds of methamphetamine at three clandestine laboratories throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the group are already in custody on separate charges, while the 
remaining five are still at-large, Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operation Crankcase 
</P>
<P>
The drug lab operation was among the biggest encountered by authorities in the 
investigation, dubbed Operation Crankcase, which resulted in the arrests of 100 
people March 19. Twenty-three meth labs in San Diego County were shut down in 
the massive sweep, which involved about 350 officers from every law enforcement 
agency in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment Thursday was based on evidence gathered during the operation of 
Triple Neck Scientific Laboratory, a privately owned company that assisted the 
Drug Enforcement Administration in investigating the purchase of chemicals and 
equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is still considered active because more arrests stemming from 
Triple Neck's operation are possible, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
The "Walters Organization," as the group indicted Thursday was known, was 
allegedly headed by Martin Edward Walters, 21, of Mira Mesa. He is in County 
Jail on charges that include kidnaping and murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Charges 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also charges Martin Edward Walters, his brother Vincent, and 
three other men who allegedly belong to the organization with kidnaping three 
people at gunpoint in an effort to obtain methamphetamine stolen from the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
In another dimension of the case, the San Diego County district attorney's 
office has filed additional kidnaping and murder charges in connection with the 
same incident, which resulted in the death last September of Kristine Reyes, 
21. Reyes was killed after she; her boyfriend, Edward Michael Provencio, and an 
unnamed friend were allegedly abducted by Juan Antonio Lopez, one of the five 
men charged in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes was found dead in a vacant El Cajon house on Sept. 30, five days after 
her kidnaping. She died after breathing fumes from a toxic chemical placed on a 
gag covering her mouth. Lopez was arrested in connection with her death in 
December, and he remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the five men were present and participated in Reyes' death. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro said police were close to arresting Martin Edward Walters on drug 
charges when the murder occurred. "(Reyes' death) really was an unfortunate 
thing," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Edward Walters "had already involved himself with Triple Neck and had 
sold to undercover officers prior to (Reyes') death," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pipe Bomb Factory 
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb factory was found at Martin Edward Walters' San Diego residence 
when investigators raided a suspected meth lab in 1987, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
Those charged with kidnaping along with Martin Edward Walters, Vincent and 
Lopez are Glenn Andrew Arnold, 22, and Michael (Satin) Lee Moore, 20. The five 
were also indicted on the drug charges. Vincent and Moore remain at-large. 
</P>
<P>
Also indicted for the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine were Paul 
Elza Walters III, 25, and Michell Denise Walters, 18, who are in custody; Kirk 
(Troll) Bush, 21; Robert Lee Hall III, 26, and Steven (Barney) Kelly Barnett, 
28, who are at large. 
</P>
<P>
On May 26, a federal grand jury returned indictments against four other people 
who had purchased chemicals and equipment from Triple Neck. In that indictment, 
the four men, identified as Mexican citizens, are charged with the manufacture 
of 9.2 pounds of methamphetamine and with attempting to manufacture an 
additional 85 pounds at the time the site was discovered by DEA agents.

BERNARDI WON STRONG LATINO, BLACK SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Precinct breakdowns from Tuesday's Los Angeles City Council election show that 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi made a strong showing in black and Latino areas of 
Pacoima and Lake View Terrace, apparently backing up his claims that he had 
strong grass-roots support there. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Bernardi also retained strong showings in the few Van Nuys 
neighborhoods that remain of his original district, which was drastically 
redrawn toward the north in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
There were few surprises in the results for challenger Lyle Hall, either. He 
did best in Mission Hills -- where he is captain of the local fire station -- 
and near his Panorama City home, in Arleta and in parts of Sun Valley near the 
Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall lost the Panorama City precinct where he lives, 37% to Bernardi's 63%, 
while Bernardi won the northern Van Nuys precinct where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fertile Ground 
</P>
<P>
All of Lake View Terrace was fertile ground for Bernardi, but particularly the 
neighborhoods nearest Lake View Medical Center, where he gained nearly 
three-fourths of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., 
attributed Bernardi's popularity in the area to his opposition to a proposal to 
locate the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation in the defunct medical 
center. Hall supported that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
When the former First Lady killed the center plan by withdrawing her 
participation 11 days before the election because of community opposition, Snow 
said, Lake View Terrace residents felt that Bernardi's backing had contributed 
to her decision. 
</P>
<P>
Lake View Terrace also includes some of the most predominantly black areas of 
the district, although with the low turnout in Tuesday's election -- not quite 
20% of the voters registered in the 7th District -- it was not known whether 
Bernardi actually drew a large black vote there. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi's best precinct was in southeast Lake View Terrace near the Little 
Tujunga Wash, where he gained 85% of the vote. That is generally the more rural 
area of Lake View Terrace, where horse owners endorsed Bernardi and praised him 
for helping preserve their trails and rural life style. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon Landfill 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent also won precincts closest to the Lopez Canyon Landfill, in Lake 
View Terrace and Pacoima, even though Hall had taken a stronger position 
against the city-operated dump. 
</P>
<P>
During the primary, both candidates promised to call for immediate closure of 
the dump, a step sought by many area residents. But in the runoff, Bernardi 
said such a stance might not be realistic until alternative solutions for 
disposing of Los Angeles' garbage could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar, Los Angeles' fastest growing community, was an important battleground 
in the runoff race for a San Fernando Valley City Council seat, campaign 
consultants said. The more than 4,000 votes cast there in the primary showed 
that it held enough votes to sway the election. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar is where both Bernardi and Hall located their campaign headquarters, 
within a block of each other on Foothill Boulevard. Both campaigns organized 
precinct walking, placard posting and telephoning in Sylmar neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
When votes were tallied Tuesday, neither candidate had won the area decisively. 
Of the 4,149 votes cast in Sylmar, 2,308 went to Bernardi and 1,841 to Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi won the election by 1,658 votes -- 8,826 to 7,168. 
</P>
<P>
Precinct-by-precinct totals show that Hall gained many of the neighborhoods 
closest to San Fernando. His best precinct, where he gained 71% of the vote, 
was between Glenoaks Boulevard and Herrick Avenue, next to San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rural Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi won the more rural neighborhoods and most of the region northeast of 
the Foothill Freeway. His campaign consultant, Allan Hoffenblum, said that once 
again horse owners and other rural enthusiasts who backed Bernardi made the 
difference there. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum also said Bernardi gained ground in Sylmar after the more 
conservative voters there learned of Hall's endorsement by the liberal Edmund 
G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., former California governor and current chairman of the 
state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's campaign has insisted that Brown's endorsement did not hurt them with 
conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
Already there are indications that Sylmar may prove to be an important 
battleground in the 1993 City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Magana, who indicated interest in running this year but then decided to 
help Bernardi instead, said he "would be very interested in running" in four 
years. He lives in Sylmar and said he would work to gain the area's backing. 
</P>
<P>
Jules S. Bagneris III, a candidate in the primary, recently said he may move 
from Lake View Terrace to Sylmar to broaden his base of support in preparation 
for the next council election.

FIRED SHERIFF'S DISPATCHER WORKED WHILE HE WAS INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while this spring, Daniel Haynes was a San Diego County sheriff's 
dispatcher and a San Diego County inmate. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old veteran of the Sheriff's Department would leave his bunk each 
day at the county Probation Department's work-furlough center, where he is 
incarcerated on a 180-day sentence for misdemeanor battery. From there he would 
report to work as a senior communications dispatcher, directing sheriff's 
deputies to emergency crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
That paradox lasted about a month, from early April until early May, when the 
department fired him from his job of the last eight years. Now Haynes is 
scheduled to appear before the county's Civil Service Commission on Monday and 
Tuesday at public hearings in which he will ask for his job back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Recall Precedent 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anyone else" who was simultaneously an inmate and a member of 
a law enforcement agency, said Michael Specht, spokesman for the Probation 
Department's work-furlough program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first case that I can recall of an on-duty, active-duty law 
enforcement employee maintaining his job while incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt, an attorney who is representing Haynes in his request to be 
reinstated with the Sheriff's Department, agreed that the dual role is 
extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
"I've represented police officers in the county under circumstances where they 
were convicted of a misdemeanor and still working, and one who is on probation 
now is serving as a sworn law enforcement officer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't think of any case I've handled where someone's been incarcerated 
at the same time he was a law enforcement employee." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes was charged Dec. 2 with assaulting his ex-wife, Nancy Haynes, and 
violating a court order to stay away from her. A month later, the Lemon Grove 
man pleaded no contest to the charges, and, in March, was sentenced to 180 days 
of probation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free to Go to Work 
</P>
<P>
But, according to court records, the probation was revoked April 7, and Haynes 
was ordered to serve the 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, he was still a senior communications dispatcher for the sheriff. 
And, because he was incarcerated at the work-furlough center, that meant he 
could leave the lock-down complex only to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said the Sheriff's Department, after investigating the assault 
allegations against Haynes, first recommended that Haynes merely be 
reprimanded. But, as the personnel matter moved up the chain of command, the 
level of discipline increased. A recommendation for a 15-day suspension was 
later upgraded to an order of termination. 
</P>
<P>
He was fired May 4, almost a month after his incarceration began. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing next week, Bobbitt hopes to win back his client's job. 
</P>
<P>
"His supervisors and the department will stipulate that he was an excellent 
employee," the attorney said. "He's very well thought of down there. 
</P>
<P>
"But their belief is that, if you're an employee of the sheriff's office, it's 
incompatible with being incarcerated. I agree that that is incompatible with 
being a sworn deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"But a dispatcher has nothing to do with enforcing laws or making law 
enforcement decisions. They just simply transmit radio calls over the airways."

MAN IS KILLED AS CAR PLUNGES FROM BRIDGE

<P>
An unidentified man was killed and a woman seriously injured early Friday when 
their car plunged from a bridge on Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and sank in a 
flood-control channel. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, also unidentified, was in critical condition Friday at UCSD Medical 
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair was traveling south on a bridge over the San Diego River flood channel 
at high speed when the accident occurred about 12:05 a.m., Deputy Coroner Ken 
Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, an off-duty lifeguard who noticed that part of the guardrail had 
been torn away, spotted the car under about 10 feet of water, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard Dave Cockrum entered the channel and found the woman near the bridge 
pylons. She had either been ejected from the car or had been pulled out of the 
vehicle by incoming current, said Nick Lerma, another lifeguard who arrived at 
the scene minutes after Cockrum. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor, a white female 20 to 30 years old, was taken by Life Flight to 
UCSD Medical Center, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
The man's body, wedged inside the car, was recovered when the vehicle was 
pulled by a tow truck from the water. 
</P>
<P>
The pair carried no identification, Bell said. The man, also white, was 6 feet, 
10 inches tall, thought to be in his 40s and wearing a black shirt, blue jacket 
and brown corduroy pants. ANTHONY MILLICAN

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former sheriff's deputy pleaded innocent Friday to a federal charge of 
violating the civil rights of a Vista man during a 1987 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Galvan of Escondido appeared before U.S. Magistrate Barry Moskowitz, 
who set bail at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan, who was indicted earlier this week, surrendered Friday after his 
arraignment and was briefly taken into custody. He was released after posting 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan is charged with depriving John McDougall of his civil rights by beating 
him with a flashlight while McDougall was being restrained during an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant no longer works for the Sheriff's Department, but his attorney, 
James Gattey, said in court that Galvan is appealing his firing. 
</P>
<P>
The case is one of about 70 being investigated by the U.S. attorney's office 
after complaints of beatings by deputies, mostly in jails. It is the only one 
in which charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
The charge is a misdemeanor, and Galvan could be sentenced to one year in jail 
and receive a $100,000 if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate ordered the former deputy to return to court Monday to schedule 
future hearings.

SITTER HELD IN ATTEMPTED MURDER OF CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police Friday arrested a baby-sitter on suspicion of attempted 
murder after paramedics found an 18-month-old Van Nuys girl bruised and 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Nova Marcia Thompson, 34, of Van Nuys was jailed without bail a day after 
paramedics were called to her home in the 14300 block of Vanowen Street when 
the child she was caring for stopped breathing, police said. Police did not 
release the child's name. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Warren Knowles said the girl's father had left her in Thompson's care 
Wednesday and was going to return for her Thursday afternoon. But Thompson 
called the father Thursday morning and said the girl had stopped breathing. The 
father notified paramedics, who took the girl to Valley Presbyterian Hospital 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called because paramedics and doctors noticed bruises on the girl's 
head and body and a burn mark on her leg, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said investigators have not determined exactly how the girl was 
injured. He said Thompson was arrested Thursday on suspicion of child abuse but 
was rearrested Friday on suspicion of attempted murder when detectives received 
a doctor's report that the girl remained in a coma on life-support equipment 
and was not expected to live.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL SALUTES TAFT'S ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
CHAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Taft High School academic decathlon team received a commendation 
from the Los Angeles City Council on Friday for winning the national 
championship recently. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus said the Woodland Hills team had "achieved the ultimate 
academically," adding that it is important to praise youths for academic 
achievements as well as prowess in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very seldom that people get praise for using their minds," commented 
Councilman Nate Holden. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he considered the team not only the national winners but the 
international winners as well, because the students beat teams from Northern 
Ireland and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft team won the national decathlon championship on May 1 in Providence, 
R.I.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT KILLS BOY DRIVING STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old Sun Valley boy driving a stolen automobile was killed Friday when 
the car struck a tree in North Hollywood, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Four other juveniles, ages 14 and 15, fled the scene, but one of them later 
walked into the North Hollywood police station and gave detectives information 
about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old North Hollywood boy was questioned and taken into custody on 
suspicion of auto theft, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bruce Herschong said the car involved in the accident was stolen about a 
month ago from a West Los Angeles street. The car was traveling west on Stagg 
Street at 8:30 a.m. when it struck the curb on the north side of the street, 
hit a tree, spun around and halted next to a fence, Herschong said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver died at the scene and witnesses said the other youths fled. The 
informant was cut and bruised in the accident and said the other youths 
suffered similar injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Herschong said the driver had not been drinking and was not speeding when the 
accident occurred.

PADRES TALK, THEN DON'T ACT AND LOSE, 12-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patience is something Padre Manager Jack McKeon professes to hold in an 
abundant amount. 
</P>
<P>
Be it waiting out a reluctant trading partner or keeping the faith with his 
team when all around him see trouble, McKeon stresses an even approach. 
</P>
<P>
But this Padre team is beginning to push him to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon held a rare pregame meeting before Friday night's game against the San 
Francisco Giants in hopes of turning around what has become a disastrous road 
swing. But the Padres must not have listened hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
They promptly went out and lost their most lopsided game of the year, 12-2, to 
the Giants in front of 17,993 at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Padres two games under .500 (30-32) for the first time 
since they were 19-21 on May 15. They trail first-place Cincinnati and Houston 
by six games, the biggest deficit of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have lost four in a row and seven of their first eight on this 
10-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of play is what prompted McKeon to call the meeting. Speaking to 
reporters before the game, he was sketchy about details. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just our regular monthly meeting," he said. "Like some guys go to the 
Rotary (Club)." 
</P>
<P>
But he hinted that he expressed general displeasure with the direction of his 
team and its lack of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a refresher course," McKeon said. "You figure at this level you don't 
have to worry about motivating guys; you figure pride will do that." 
</P>
<P>
So far, that has not been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Everything -- except for the play of Tony Gwynn, who extended his hitting 
streak to 11 games with an infield single in the seventh -- seems to have 
failed them on this trip. 
</P>
<P>
It was all of their starting pitching in Cincinnati. Their ace reliever, Mark 
Davis, in Houston. Friday, it was their prize free-agent acquisition, pitcher 
Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, taken from the Boston Red Sox for a reported $5.25 million over three 
years, gave up six runs and 10 hits in the five innings in losing for the third 
time in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the Giants have ripped Hurst (5-5). They greeted 
him in his National League debut with eight runs and 10 hits in an 8-3 loss 
April 4. 
</P>
<P>
If Hurst had to make his living pitching against San Francisco, he might want 
to consider returning to the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Starting the damage was Kevin Mitchell, whose 400-foot homer to left led off 
the second inning. It was Mitchell's 23rd (second off Hurst) and gave him 62 
RBIs. Both figures lead the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who hit his first homer since Monday, is one game ahead of Roger 
Maris' pace in 1961, when Maris hit a record 61 homers. Friday night's game was 
the Giants' 60th. Maris hit his 23rd in the New York Yankees' 61st game. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mitchell's only hit of the game, but his impact was felt in other ways. 
Although his only RBI came on his solo home run, Mitchell could be considered 
responsible for seven of the Giants' first eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
That's because three times the Padres walked Mitchell, twice intentionally, to 
load the bases and instead pitch to Tracy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy appeared sound on paper. Jones entered the game batting .127 with 
three RBIs and flew out in his first at-bat. But as has been the Padres' fate 
lately, statistics and odds meant little. Three times the Padres walked 
Mitchell, and three times Jones countered with a two-run single -- in the third 
and fifth off Hurst and in the sixth on an infield hit off reliever Greg 
Booker. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Padres, the Giants removed Mitchell in the seventh before 
he could scare them into further damage. By then, San Francisco held an 11-0 
lead with the help of Ken Oberkfell's three-run, pinch-hit homer in the sixth 
off Booker. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Injuries were the news of the day in the minor league system -- three of the 
Padres' top draft picks of the past five years are out with injuries. 
Right-handed pitcher Andy Benes, the first player taken in the 1988 amateur 
free-agent draft, has been placed on the seven-day disabled list at double-A 
Wichita with tendinitis in his right shoulder, a Padre spokesman said. It is 
not considered serious, and the move is viewed as precautionary. Benes will 
miss two starts. He lost for the second time in nine decisions Wednesday. Benes 
has 95 strikeouts in 86 innings and a 1.14 earned-run average. Right-handed 
pitcher Steve Loubier (7-3, 1.55 ERA) was moved up from Class-A Riverside to 
take Benes' place. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Shane Mack, who started the season on the disabled list before he 
was assigned to triple-A Las Vegas on May 4, will undergo arthroscopic surgery 
Tuesday to correct a bone spur in his right elbow and will be out indefinitely. 
Mack, the Padres' first pick in 1984, injured the elbow in the off-season and 
missed the final 1 1/2 weeks of spring training. Mack was hitting .225 in 24 
games for Las Vegas. He has a .241 average in 161 games as a Padre over two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Thomas Howard, the Padres' top choice in 1986, also will have 
arthroscopic surgery Tuesday to repair cartilage damage in his left knee and 
will be out four to six weeks. Howard was leading Las Vegas in hitting (.305) 
in 50 games.

WITHOUT HIS SIGHT OR HEARING, INDOMITABLE CASEY COOK OF RIO MESA THINKS NOTHING 
OF PARTICIPATING IN 3 SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Cook recalls vividly the day she looked out the kitchen window and saw 
her youngest son, Casey, hurtling out of control down the driveway toward the 
street on his sister's bicycle. A moment of panic for any parent. 
</P>
<P>
A bit more so when your son is blind. 
</P>
<P>
"He went quite a way before he rammed into a parked car," she said. "And then 
it was off to the emergency room of the hospital. Again. Casey has been in more 
hospital emergency rooms than I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
Cook laughs as the story is relayed to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've given my parents a scare or two," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Weatherford, a very young-looking 33, recalls the first time she met 
Cook. 
</P>
<P>
"People always say that they can't believe I'm 33," she said. "People tell me 
all the time they figure I'm about 25. And after spending a few hours with 
Casey, he asked me how old I was. When I told him, he said, 'C'mon. I thought 
you were about 25.' He picked it up right away." 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad show of perceptiveness for a blind kid. But a bit more remarkable 
when you learn that Cook is also deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just astounded," said Weatherford, who works as Cook's sign-language 
interpreter. "I've worked with kids with these handicaps before, and I just 
couldn't figure it out. He couldn't see me and he couldn't hear my voice, and 
yet he responded to me exactly the way everyone else does. I was just shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 17, said he had made the assumption that Weatherford was only in her 20s 
because of the energy she showed as she conversed with him in a special 
hand-in-hand code. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the day I realized that Casey Cook is somebody very special," 
Weatherford said. 
</P>
<P>
Special. Remarkable. Rare. You hear those words often from the friends and 
family of Cook. He insists that he wants no special treatment, does not want to 
be singled out for any praise. He just wants to be one of the guys at Rio Mesa 
High, where he has run track and cross-country, wrestled for the varsity and 
now is one of the school's best swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as he doesn't want any special attention, he will always stand out," 
Weatherford said. "He'll stand out because he's such a rare, rare breed. He has 
such a tremendous drive and focus on what he wants to do. He has such 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
Cook's athletic accomplishments include: 
</P>
<P>
A victory in the 3,000-meter run in the 1988 Northern California Championships 
for Blind Athletes; 
</P>
<P>
Six gold medals and three silvers in swimming in the 1988 U. S. Blind Athletic 
Assn. Summer Nationals in Indianapolis; 
</P>
<P>
A bronze medal in swimming in the 1988 Paralympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
He departs today for Cape Girardeau, Mo., to swim in the USBAA's 12-sport, 
seven-day Summer National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But his real accomplishments are in his daily life in a silent and dark world. 
Cook has made a steely commitment not just to get through life, but to embrace 
it and take from it all it can give. 
</P>
<P>
The Cooks' oldest son, Chris, 25, also is blind and deaf. His condition was 
caused by Vogt-Koyanagi Syndrome -- also know as Ocular Cutaneous Syndrome -- 
an extremely rare and incurable disease that only afflicts males and ultimately 
causes blindness through detachment of the retinas, and later, deafness. 
</P>
<P>
The first symptoms were dozens of white, snowflake-like spots of rapidly dying 
tissue that appeared on Chris Cook's eyes at the age of 1 and robbed him of his 
sight and his hearing. Doctors assured the Cooks that the disease could not be 
genetically transmitted, and the Cooks continued to build a family. Two 
daughters followed, then Casey was born in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
With the assurance of specialists, the Cooks began raising their new infant, 
fully expecting a healthy boy to grow into a healthy man. 
</P>
<P>
"But one morning, around his first birthday, I went in to wake him up and I saw 
the white spots," said Kathy Cook. "Exactly the same white spots on the eyes 
that Chris had at the same age. It happened, literally, overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't quite believe it. In the years since, every doctor we have talked 
with has said this is the only case they know of with two members of the same 
family being afflicted." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the light went out of Casey's world. By the age of 8 he was blind. 
And then his hearing began to diminish, finally dissolving to total deafness 
last year. He spent several years at the California School for the Blind in 
Fremont and eventually worked himself into a regular curriculum at Fremont 
High. 
</P>
<P>
And last fall, Cook came home and enrolled at Rio Mesa. The Oxnard Union High 
School District located Weatherford and hired her to be Cook's eyes, ears and 
companion. She sits beside him in class, relaying the teacher's words through 
an intricate system called tactile signing, in which she taps out the symbols 
for the words into the palms of Cook's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The system is so precise that even the subtle nuances of the English language 
are relayed to Cook, complete with laughter and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
And, because his hearing loss became total only in the past 18 months, Cook 
speaks in a strong and clear voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't miss my vision that much," he said, "but I do miss my hearing. After I 
lost my sight, my hearing became so important to me. And now, that's gone too. 
I miss being able to listen to music. And I miss hearing my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Cook's father, Ron, played baseball at USC from 1962-66 and Casey grew up in an 
active sports-minded family. Cook said that his decision to participate in 
sports was a natural one. He never considered not playing sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I was willing to try anything," he said. "Skateboarding and wrestling and 
running track and cross-country and riding a bike and even windsurfing. But 
swimming was always the sport I enjoyed most. And that's because it's a sport 
that I don't need any help in doing. Just get me into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I ran cross-country how much I enjoyed it. But I needed a 
guide to run with and I always heard the whispers from the other kids. I could 
hear them sneaking off when it was time to practice or race and overhearing 
them saying how they didn't want to 'have to run with that blind kid again.' I 
just got tired of all that." 
</P>
<P>
In the pool, his mother or father or swimming coach Sandy Nielson-Bell, who was 
a member of the U. S. Olympic swim team in 1972, follows Casey from one end of 
the pool to the other with a tennis ball attached to a pole. When he nears the 
end of a lap, he is tapped on the head with the tennis ball and immediately 
goes into a flip-turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I lose about a half-second on each turn over sighted people," he said, 
"but it's not so bad that I can't compete with them. It does make a difference, 
but I can overcome the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part about swimming blind is just swimming. Swimming is a very 
hard sport." 
</P>
<P>
He swims upward of 6,000 yards a day at the Pleasant Valley Swim Club in 
Camarillo and considers the 200-meter breaststroke his strongest event. Cook, 
who will complete his sophomore year at Rio Mesa this month, said that he hopes 
to improve his swimming skills enough to compete in college. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason I can't," he said, "if I work hard enough at it." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, there are other goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think about all my friends getting their driver's licenses and 
zooming around in their cars," he said. "Someday I'd like to walk out of the 
house, jump in the car and zoom on over to a friend's house." 
</P>
<P>
At this, Kathy Cook's eyebrows rise dramatically. She recalls her son flying 
down the driveway on a bike and slamming into the parked car. And now he's 
talking about driving a car? 
</P>
<P>
The eyebrows fall now and Kathy Cook smiles at her son. The day that he stops 
thinking about new things to do, about new adventures and new challenges and 
the day that he stops dreaming, then she will worry. 
</P>
<P>
"When I meet people," Casey Cook said, "I can sense immediately what they are 
thinking and feeling. I can tell that most people are trying to figure me out, 
as though they are examining a person from another planet. I can sense that 
strangeness when they meet me.

TEEN SWIMMER CITES AS UNFAIR LOSS OF GRANT FOR TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Veronica Hernandez figured it was too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
And she was right. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is a 14-year-old swimmer from Sherman Oaks with Olympic dreams. She 
has the skills and desire to perhaps realize those dreams. But she does not 
have the resources. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Glendale YMCA senior swim team, Hernandez started swimming in 
Junior Olympic competition at age 9 and in national meets at 12. She recently 
finished eighth in her age group in the 200 butterfly in the Y Short Course 
nationals and is currently ranked 24th in her age group by US Swimming, the 
national governing body for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
But Hernandez is one of three children in a single-parent household. Her mother 
works as a housekeeper, earning $1,200 a month. Money is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine Hernandez's joy when she learned that she had been selected as one 
of 25 athletes in California and Florida to receive a cash grant from the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and Glendale Federal Bank. And 
imagine her frustration when the grant, $4,000 spread over four years, was 
snatched away just hours before she was to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
The money was denied to Hernandez and five other athletes when the NCAA ruled 
that the receipt of such a payment could cost them their college eligibility. 
All six compete in sports sanctioned by the NCAA at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Hernandez arrived at the AAF office to receive her award, a message 
arrived from the NCAA disallowing the grant. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know there was any problem," said Betty Freeman, the Sherman Oaks 
woman for whom Hernandez's mother worked and who has assumed the financial 
burden for Hernandez's athletic career. "The grants were to be based on 
financial need and given to someone like Veronica who is an exceptional student 
and swimmer. We were told it was all being worked out with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said an official with the AAF told her the money might have to be 
awarded to Hernandez's swim club instead of to the swimmer directly, but even 
that approach was eventually rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us when to be there for the presentation. When we got there, they 
told the people in question to go into a separate room," Freeman said. "Then 
they showed us a copy of a letter faxed from the NCAA that stated that payment 
in any form would jeopardize the athlete's standing with the NCAA. It was a 
great disappointment. We feel things should have been worked out before the 
money was ever offered." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's language was a little stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of stupid," she said. "I didn't come there to get an award. 
I came there to get the money. It's not right. It means only the rich kids can 
go to the Olympics. I can't afford that. The rules ought to be changed. I don't 
think it's fair." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Amanda Henry, 18, of Thousand Oaks. A cyclist, she received her 
grant because she is not involved in an NCAA sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very honored," Henry said. "The money is going to help a lot. I am going 
to be doing a lot of traveling to compete that I wouldn't otherwise be doing." 
</P>
<P>
But as for what happened to Hernandez and some of the others, "I thought it was 
pretty low," Henry said. "It's really hard for everyone at that level to 
compete anyway. It's not like they're going to take the money and go out and 
spend it. It's just enough to keep the competition level high enough to be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stressful situation to put people in. A lot of them seemed to be in 
real shock when they found out they weren't getting the money. Everybody's 
hearts went out to them. 
</P>
<P>
"But someone who lost their NCAA eligibility in swimming would really be 
missing out. A lot of kids are eligible for big athletic scholarships, and 
that's their way through college. I'm lucky my sport is not an NCAA sport." 
</P>
<P>
The sympathy for Hernandez and the five others, including fencer Avi Friedlich, 
17, of Encino, extends all the way to the top. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm distressed," said Anita de Frantz, president of the AAF and a member of 
the International Olympic Committee. "It would be like a young, musically 
talented person being told they can't take any lessons until they get to 
college. That doesn't happen. In sports, it does. The purpose of the grant is 
to train these people and enhance their skills. Why should a young person be 
denied that opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
"We had been talking with the NCAA for months. We knew it could be a problem, 
but it was not until the morning of the awards that we got a letter in 
writing." 
</P>
<P>
The rules are clear, according to Rick Evrard, director of legislative services 
for the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"NCAA rules state," Evrard said, "that a student may receive actual and 
necessary expenses to participate in a sport by the school he or she attends or 
by the organization sponsoring the competition. That's all. Compensation in any 
form is violative of amateur regulations." 
</P>
<P>
De Frantz hopes that some good may still come of the whole affair. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best evidence of the problem," she said. "In my judgment, it's a 
case of the NCAA overreaching its authority. You shouldn't have to be wealthy 
to compete. These athletes need support now. This has nothing to do with why 
the NCAA has to regulate collegiate sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA will be meeting with the U. S. Olympic Committee soon to discuss 
issues of amateurism. I hope this will be discussed. I hope the corporations 
also become outraged. What we need is some outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Evrard, too, saw the need for reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of those meetings could come proposed legislation," he said. "That is a 
possibility. The only thing we can do is take back a message to the committees 
that we have a problem out there. It's an age-old question. How the Olympic 
movement defines amateurism is not the same as how we define it." 
</P>
<P>
But while issues are worked over in committee rooms, what of Hernandez and her 
dreams? 
</P>
<P>
"That money would have meant," Freeman said, "that we could hire a trainer to 
work with Veronica at least once a week and help her with all the things that 
go into making a real champion. It could have helped pay the expenses of 
traveling to national and international meets. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for the U. S. to have athletes to represent us in the 
Olympics or any international competition when some are not able to afford the 
training it takes. Things like this large corporation wanting to help out are 
very commendable and, I believe, should be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have taken care of Veronica's expenses and will continue to do so, but those 
expenses have gotten high and will get higher. The minimum figure for her 
expenses over the next four years is $20,000. But Veronica's real purpose is to 
get a scholarship to a major university so she can study dentistry. There is no 
way she can have that college education without a scholarship. And we will do 
nothing to jeopardize that. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easier if they had helped out, but, come hell or high 
water, I will get Veronica a scholarship to a major college and to the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is just as determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I will get the money somehow," she said. "I don't know how, but I will keep 
swimming." 
</P>

KENNEDY WINS 3-A TENNIS TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
DEPTH CARRIES GOLDEN COUGARS PAST EAGLE ROCK IN CITY FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Raub was supremely confident that his Kennedy High boys' tennis team 
would respond to the challenge of the City Section 3-A Division championships 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is really happy-go-lucky and casual about everything," Raub said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that the Golden Cougars took the 3-A title in stride, using a 
well-balanced attack to defeat two-time defending champion Eagle Rock, 20-9 
1/2, at the Racquet Centre in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, which dropped from the 4-A to the 3-A Division this season, had never 
previously reached the final round of the City team finals. This season, 
however, depth set Kennedy apart. As a prime example, the Golden Cougars' three 
doubles teams combined to win 43 of 45 sets during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to have a chance, we were going to have to semi-neutralize their 
doubles," said Eagle Rock coach Hal Stepeau, whose team had won five of the 
last seven 3-A titles. "We just couldn't find any holes or creases to probe." 
</P>
<P>
After his team beat Poly in the semifinals Tuesday, Raub lightened his rigorous 
practice regimen, cutting workouts short. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that if we don't have it down by 18 weeks, we don't have it down 
period," Raub said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had beaten Eagle Rock (25-2) earlier in the season, but Raub took 
nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"We were dead even," he said, touching his index finger and thumb to 
approximate the parity of the teams. "It was by the skin of our butts." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's Bobby Butler, Tony Yean and David Schwartz each lost a singles match 
and Josh Etting lost twice. In doubles, Eun Sung Song and Che Naveja, the 
Cougars' No. 3 team that did not lose a set in the regular season, swept their 
matches, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. Henry Wang and Jimmy Min also swept three matches, 6-1, 
6-4, 6-4. Ted LeGrand and Tin Hoang won two sets, 6-2, 6-3, and lost, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, which stunned University in the quarterfinals, lost to Palisades, 23 
1/2-6, in the 4-A Division championship that also was held Friday at the 
Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of how hard they worked to get here," Taft Coach Marvin Jones said 
of the Toreadors (13-4), who last won a 4-A Division title in 1984. "In a round 
robin, it's depth that counts . . . and Palisades is deep." 
</P>
<P>
Palisades Coach Bob Kling agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we've had three or four nationally-ranked kids and they come out 
here and decimate people," said Kling, who has won 10 team championships. "This 
year, we just have a bunch of hard-working kids." 
</P>
<P>
Taft failed to win a singles set. Scott Pitters came the closest when he lost, 
7-6 (8-6 in the tiebreaker), to Drake Jantze, Palisades' top player. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hartman and Jeff Harlan of Taft defeated Greg Rosenbloom and Damon Curran, 
6-2, and beat Jeremy Grunstein and Arseen Solomon, 6-2. Beau Heggen and Derek 
Halpern won Taft's only other set, beating Rosenbloom and Curran, 7-5.

MAXWELL LABORATORIES CAN EXPECT MORE UNINVITED BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Maxwell Laboratories' rejection of JAYCOR's uninvited $17-per-share merger bid 
probably opened the door to more bids for the San Diego-based company that 
develops high-tech products for military and commercial markets, industry 
analysts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's board of directors Thursday rejected JAYCOR's $17 cash bid as 
"inadequate and otherwise on unacceptable terms and not in the best interests 
of the stockholders and the company." Maxwell closed up $1.25 at $15.75 Friday. 
It reported a $14.20-a-share book value on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts suggested that shareholder pressure would force Maxwell's board to 
seriously consider a bid of $20 a share or above, and those analysts seemed 
confident that more bids are likely. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the genie is out of the bottle, there are always more bids," said Larry 
Selwitz, a Newport Beach-based industry analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., who 
suggested that Maxwell's board would have to "seriously consider" a bid of $20 
or more a share. 
</P>
<P>
"In Wall Street jargon, the company is now 'in play,' " according to Irving 
Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "The question 
is whether (Maxwell's board) . . . can reject someone who comes in with a 
respectable offer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pulsed-Power Equipment 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell designs, develops and manufactures pulsed-power equipment and performs 
research and computer-based analysis for defense, energy, industrial and 
environmental markets. Maxwell reported $1.3 million in net income and $29.3 
million in sales for the six-month period ended Jan. 31. Its order backlog on 
Jan. 31 was $109 million. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Maxwell announced the formation of FoodCo, a majority-owned 
subsidiary that boasts three multibillion-dollar corporations as 
minority-interest partners. The highly secretive operation is believed to be 
using Maxwell's pulsed-power technology for food-processing and food-packaging 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
JAYCOR Vice President E.S. Hamilton on Friday declined to comment on his 
company's bid for Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
JAYCOR, a privately held, San Diego-based defense contractor, reported about 
$65 million in 1988 revenue. JAYCOR provides scientific and engineering support 
services, largely to military customers, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 of its 800 employees are in San Diego. Nearly 500 employees work in 
the Washington area and the rest work at smaller offices around the country. 
JAYCOR, which was founded in 1975, is principally owned by its employees and 
ex-employees, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Vice President Sean M. Maloy on Friday said that JAYCOR's bid 
conflicted with the company's "aggressive growth strategy," which includes the 
possible acquisition of other companies. Being acquired now would disrupt that 
strategy, Maloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, a publicly traded company, in recent years has added several 
anti-takeover defenses. It adopted a fair-price provision that forces possible 
suitors to negotiate a takeover with its board of directors. Maxwell also 
staggered the terms of its board members, which could make it more difficult 
for a hostile suitor to gain control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Selwitz maintained that Maxwell is ripe for a merger or an acquisition 
because "management has less than 10% of outstanding shares, the stock has been 
selling 
</P>
<P>
at below book value, and it's a company that's on the leading edge of its 
technology. . . . I see some awesome potential in the military and commercial 
arenas." 
</P>
<P>
Katz suggested that Maxwell's board "could easily have rejected JAYCOR's 
initial bid because "nobody really knows much about (JAYCOR), there's no 
indication that they've tried to accumulate Maxwell stock, and you don't even 
know if they could arrange financing to carry it off." 
</P>
<P>
However, "Maxwell's next shareholder meeting will look like some kind of 
embassy riot if they turn down something above $20 a share," Selwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell is a leader in the development of pulsed-power devices that have the 
potential to be used in many military and commercial products. Maxwell, for 
example, has used government contracts to research high-energy pulsed-power 
systems that may one day be used to fire armor-piercing shells or power space 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded Maxwell a contract to use 
its pulsed-power technology to evaluate the content of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Maxwell won a $20-million contract from Louisiana State 
University to build a massive X-ray light source that will be used to design 
and build ultra-high-density microelectronic devices.

DANCER FINDS IDEAL ROLE TO EXORCISE COCAINE DEMON 
</P>

<P>
Art imitates life, but sometimes the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case for Tony Caligagan, a 27-year-old San Diego dancer who left 
the nest in 1985 for a shot at big-time dance in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Caligagan immediately caught the eye of modern-dance legend Alvin Ailey. And, 
before he had time to acclimate himself to New York, he was learning from the 
master himself and performing as a scholarship student with Alvin Ailey III (a 
junior offshoot of the world-class troupe). 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a whirlwind career that catapulted the charismatic dancer from the 
concert stage to a leading role in the original cast of "Lost Luggage," a 
musical that has taken several European countries by storm since its 1987 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that my role in the show relates to what happened in my life," 
Caligagan said by phone from New York. "My character is a crack dealer, and I 
was a cocaine addict until last August. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Lost Luggage' is a show about a crack addict, his wife and a dealer. They 
tell a story about life in New York City and how drugs can kill. Playing the 
part helps me to exorcise that demon constantly, and it allows me to be a part 
of something that has a tremendous value in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
Caligagan's talent extends beyond the dance and theater world, but he shrugs 
off his gift for photography as "just a hobby," even though a striking 
photograph he took to publicize the show "appeared in posters all over the New 
York subways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
How did a young man with all this talent and opportunity get caught up in the 
drug scene? Caligagan is still searching for answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I had a good upbringing and wasn't abused as a child. I had been 
an occasional user for about five years, buying it about twice a month. I would 
go on binges during cast parties and on special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I didn't realize, was that I was sabotaging myself from the success I 
wanted so desperately," Caligagan said. "I was afraid of success and afraid of 
failure, and coke was anesthetizing me from the deep-seated pain and fear." 
</P>
<P>
Caligagan was close to his goal of becoming a full-fledged Ailey dancer, but 
the "demon" took over and poisoned his dream. 
</P>
<P>
"I had really set out to become a member of the Alvin Ailey American Dance 
Theater and was very near acceptance into the company," he recalled. "I had to 
face the dilemma of signing a contract to work for my best friends (Michael 
Kessler and Melinda Jackson) in another tour with 'Lost Luggage,' or wait to 
see if Alvin would take me." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he recalled, "After a big falling out with my best friends and 
employers, I found myself without a job, forced to leave my apartment. I felt 
lost. I would think about cocaine day and night, obsessed with it in every way 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally confessed to Michael and Melinda that I was using cocaine, but I 
didn't realize until after they questioned me about my usage how far gone I 
was," Caligagan said. "They insisted that I attend Cocaine Anonymous meetings 
the very next day. By then, I weighed less than I have ever weighed as an 
adult. My thinking was clouded, and my speech impeded." 
</P>
<P>
Even after hitting bottom, however, Caligagan was not free of his addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I continued to use coke for another week -- even while attending meetings," he 
said. "I finally got up one night, said a prayer, and flushed what I had (about 
$1,000 worth) down the toilet. On the same night, I found myself calling my 
supplier, bought more drugs on credit and snorted about 2 grams of pure cocaine 
-- twice the dose it would take to kill the average person. "Because I had 
built up such an addiction, I managed by the grace of God not to die," he said. 
"Now, it's time to clean up my life and do what I came here for -- dance." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Caligagan's story is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
"Even people in major dance companies are using drugs. Dancers are considered 
more fit than Olympic athletes," he noted, "and they shouldn't do that to their 
bodies. There's a considerable amount of pain involved in dancing, and they 
have two choices. They can stay very healthy, or they can take the easy way out 
and take pills and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Caligagan has seen what choosing the latter can do. Now, he wants to educate 
people about the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be more public support and more retribution for people doing it," 
he said. "It's not cool any more." 
</P>
<P>
With a new determination to succeed, Caligagan signed on for another major tour 
with "Lost Luggage." He credits Kessler and Jackson for "taking the gamble with 
me." The first stop is a four-to-six-week stint in Germany, and then there are 
plans for the show to go globe-hopping, or at least throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting ready to return to Europe in July, and if Columbia Artists 
decides to do the booking, we'll be doing a U. S. tour after that. With the 
right publicity and booking agent, we should make it to Broadway," he said, 
with renewed confidence. "The show touches people, and we get standing ovations 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling of disgust and shame are still hard to deal with," he said, "but 
with therapy, I have come a long way. I hope anyone reading this would take 
heed. The main message is, to be successful don't take drugs."

CHINESE ARTIST RELISHES HER FREEDOM TO SPEAK OUT

Now, I even see an element of revenge in this work; it is as if I were 
intentionally thumbing my nose at those nameless and faceless authorities who 
controlled my life and art in China. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Li Huai 
</P>
<P>
Those fateful words, written months ago by Li Huai about her art, resonate with 
the spirit of the pro-democracy demonstrators slaughtered by Chinese soldiers 
last weekend in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Li Huai, 34, is the subject of an exhibition, "Li Huai: An Artist in Two 
Cultures," that opens today at the San Diego Museum of Art. Though she is 
elated about the exhibit of 60 of her artworks made before and after coming to 
the United States in 1983, Li Huai's attention is divided between San Diego and 
her hometown of Beijing. "We try to follow what's going on there as close as 
possible," Li Huai said Thursday at a press preview. "We call our friends in 
different fields -- some in art, some working-class -- to get as broad a view 
as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Some friends talk candidly with Li Huai and her husband, Paul Pickowicz, a UC 
San Diego Chinese history and film professor. Others, reminded of the years of 
terror and betrayal during China's Cultural Revolution, speak in guarded 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
The midnight phone calls to China have drawn out a picture "much more ghastly 
than the U.S. media has given," Pickowicz said. Her friends say that bodies of 
the hated 27th Army soldiers lay rotting in the streets for days because the 
people would not touch them. Similarly, corpses of people from outside Beijing, 
whom nobody knows, go unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
But other friends give conflicting accounts of the army's carting off of the 
bodies to cover up the numbers of people killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised," Li Huai said. "People have seen the problems all the way 
along -- the problems of freedom of speech." One of the worst problems in China 
is self-censorship, Li Huai said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have had bad experiences, terrible, horrible experiences in the past," 
she said, referring to the dark days of betrayal during the Cultural Revolution 
of 1966-76. "They don't trust each other. In China, the relationship between 
human beings is very intense, full of doubts, full of concerns. I feel that it 
is very, very abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
"They count on self-censorship. I think it is very sick." 
</P>
<P>
Such paranoia in China is entrenched. Even Li Huai declined to give the names 
of family and friends out of concern for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
Li Huai left China because of the restrictions on artistic expression. Though 
conditions had improved 
</P>
<P>
dramatically since the Cultural Revolution,the expression of intellectual 
curiosity was still limited. 
</P>
<P>
"In China, talent is allowed to die on the vine," Pickowicz said. "The reality 
is that, if Li Huai had not come to the United States, her talent could not 
have been realized." 
</P>
<P>
In the exhibit, extensive text panels on the museum's walls give a surprisingly 
in-depth account of the impact of the Cultural Revolution on artists and of Li 
Huai's efforts to plumb her native artistic roots after the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the pieces in the exhibition refer to traditional Chinese art forms -- 
frescoes and brush drawings -- and Western styles such as French 
Post-Impressionism. These forms were proscribed during the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
It was only until the loosening of restrictions following the decade of 
cultural repression that Li Huai felt free to soak up and paint "forgotten 
ancient Chinese motifs." But, even under the new freedom, she felt restrained 
from painting her true feelings. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until she came to this country that Li Huai was able to throw off 
political, artistic and philosophical restrictions. Working in a burst of 
energy, she exorcised her anger at the repression she had lived through by 
painting a series of hot, angry paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The violence and horror of the Cultural Revolution are captured in "Ferule," a 
52-panel work in oil, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the panels is a self-contained prison," Pickowicz said, and a protest 
against the atrocities of the cultural revolution. But "Ferule" also speaks 
eloquently and presciently of the current events in Tian An Men Square, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This show is basically about the freedom of speech, the freedom to express 
yourself in art and in daily life," Li Huai said. "If I have a chance in art to 
speak out, I do it." 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring this commitment to speak out are her recent Voice of America 
broadcasts aimed at China. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a chance to speak in Chinese on the Voice of America," she said. "I 
remember listening to the Voice of America during the Cultural Revolution after 
midnight. Now, I feel like, 'Gosh, I want to let them know that people outside 
China know and support them.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for the crisis that has rocked China, Li Huai views it as the collision of a 
society that has glimpsed a better life and of a government that is slow to 
change. She feels that recent liberal progress in Chinese arts and cinema will 
certainly be rolled back. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the government has let the door open a little bit and exposed the 
people to different cultures," she said. "Then, they go to a certain stage, and 
they have to pull you back. They don't want to feel out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"But, when the people taste a life that is better and brighter, they want it. 
It doesn't matter how bad the situation is, people should struggle and try to 
reach what they believe is right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a long struggle. It will take positive and negative directions. 
It will be a long struggle. It's hard work." 
</P>

<P>
AN INDIVIDUAL CONFRONTS CHINA'S PAST AND PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art's exhibition of the work of Chinese artist Li Huai 
stands in stark contrast to the world-shaking events now going on in China. The 
show, officially titled "Li Huai: An Artist in Two Cultures," has nothing to 
offer in the way of grandeur to compete with the real events occurring in that 
vast nation. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it offers what the news does not. It tells the story of an 
individual -- a woman who, at age 34, is of the post-war generation we call 
"baby boomers" -- in whose life and art all the gyrations and perturbations of 
Chinese history have had a profound effect. In fact, the ultimate effect of 
those experiences was that she left China in 1983 to pursue her art career 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The several stunning insights the show offers of her experiences as an artist 
in China come only partly from the more than 60 paintings and drawings on view. 
Much of what's most revealing comes instead from the texts in which the artist 
describes, often at great length, the various works and the contexts in which 
they were produced. From these emerge the record of the often wildly varying 
rules by which the Chinese government has decreed what artists can and cannot 
do. Throughout her life, however, there were always officially decreed rules 
and restrictions of one kind or another, and this is what Li left China to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Among the earlier works in the exhibit is a group of ink and gouache paintings 
on paper depicting the artist's interpretation of ancient frescoes in four 
Taoist temples she visited in 1980 with classmates from her school, The Beijing 
Film Institute. These images are remarkable to Western eyes in the way they 
capture a sense of spiritual and metaphysical energy; that is, as 
representations of minor gods. For Li, however, what's remarkable is that she 
can actually see such a treasure of the past -- one that hasn't been destroyed 
by the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly remarkable are several landscape paintings, in gouache on paper, 
which she also produced in 1980. To our eyes, these interpretations of the 
stylistic qualities of Van Gogh and Gauguin may seem unexciting, but for Li, 
exposure to this 100-year-old European work was almost entirely new. And the 
opportunity to work openly in the style without risk of exile to the 
countryside must have seemed especially delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Another odd and nearly amateurish group of works is a series of figures in oil 
paints created from 1979 to 1982. In these, we see the artist delighting in 
being able to depict individuals -- friends, even -- without fear of being 
accused of glorifying individuals at the cost of the group. More importantly, 
though, this was her first opportunity to receive instruction in the use of oil 
paints. As an accompanying text explains, this medium was very new to China and 
was closely identified with the hostile, foreign West. 
</P>
<P>
It's against this background that Li left China for the United States, 
specifically, for Southern California, where she is now a graduate student at 
CalArts in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
The works she has produced here over the past several years suggest the 
struggle she must be experiencing: coming out of the Chinese culture, but 
looking toward establishing a mode of working that isn't necessarily 
Chinese-inspired. A relatively early, but representative, work produced on 
these shores is "The Yellow Wind" from 1985. An oil on canvas, it harks back to 
the gouache on paper paintings she did in the Taoist temples, especially in the 
way the flow of line, in the Taoist originals, seems driven by a combination of 
wind and fire. Finally, the most recent paintings combine text and imagery to 
suggest the discontinuities that prevent people from fully appreciating and 
understanding one another. They're about disjunctions, disconnections and lack 
of communication. In one of these works, a text describing how eating only 
plain rice can be embellished is accompanied by an image of two tightly 
corseted female torsos expounding their love of Mao. 
</P>
<P>
The complexity of these latter images may make one nostalgic for some of the 
simplicity of Li's early, China-born imagery. And there's certainly something 
very attractive about her presentation of the ancient gods whose images she 
encountered after the Cultural Revolution. But this whole situation, in art as 
in the world, is a confusing one. If one likes a little confusion and some 
challenge, this show is rich fare indeed. It's a case where the whole is 
greater than the sum of the parts.

JACK DASH; COCKNEY COMMUNIST WAS 'KING OF THE DOCKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Dash, 82, the Cockney Communist famous for his role in the strikes that 
plagued London's docks. Dash prided himself on being involved in every London 
dock strike between 1945 and 1970. A colorful figure and gifted orator, he was 
much in demand on the lecture circuit after his retirement. Dash was raised as 
an orphan and left school at 14, becoming a builder, a firefighter and then a 
docker. Inspired by the novels of American author Jack London, he joined the 
British Communist Party in 1936 and devoted the rest of his working life to 
protecting the pay and jobs of the dockers. The Transport and General Workers' 
Union to which he belonged barred Communists from holding union office, so Dash 
operated strictly from the soapbox and became known as "unofficial king of the 
docks." Although he unswervingly defended the Soviet line, he was a fervent 
British patriot, always reminding listeners that his country invented the 
parliamentary system and trade union tradition. Dash retired in 1969 and 
immediately organized a rent strike at his public housing project. He also 
painted, sculpted, wrote an autobiography and became a tourist guide, showing 
visitors around the city he loved. "I'm a . . . London chauvinist," he would 
often say. In London on Thursday of undisclosed causes.

The saga of the alleged Tire-Chalk-Erasers of Palos Verdes Estates is slowly 
rolling forward. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that in April, two motorists in the busy Malaga Cove shopping 
plaza were arrested, handcuffed, frisked and jailed for allegedly trying to 
circumvent the one-hour parking limit by wiping off a meter maid's chalk marks. 
The harsh enforcement drew criticism from the Malaga Cove Business and 
Professional Assn., among others. 
</P>
<P>
One defendant, Anne Bisco, a receptionist, paid an $89.50 fine this week. But 
Rosina Baur, manager of a real estate office, pleaded not guilty and will go to 
trial July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Bisco admitted that when her time ran out, she rolled her car forward and 
"rubbed it (the chalk mark) lightly." But Baur maintains that she moved her car 
into a new parking place, which would comply with regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have paid the fine," Baur said. "But you can only preserve democracy 
if you fight for your rights." 
</P>
<P>
The great-grandson of Jesse James will ride into Pasadena next week for a date 
at high noon -- to deliver a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
Like the legendary train and bank robber, James R. Ross is also involved with 
lawbreakers, but on the other side. He's an Orange County Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 63, who was a lawyer for three decades in Los Angeles, hopes his new 
book, "I, Jesse James," will clear up some myths about Great-Granddad. But he 
doesn't paint him as a complete innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"As an attorney I'd hate to argue that it's self-defense when you're running 
from a bank robbery and you shoot a guy who was shooting at you," Ross said. 
"He did kill some people." 
</P>
<P>
But Ross believes that Jesse, who was fatally shot in the back in 1882 by 
gang-member Bob ("The Dirty Little Coward") Ford, might have been a preacher 
like his father. But he was reportedly enraged as a youngster when he was 
beaten by federal troops and later when authorities broke his mother's arm. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who will speak before the Huntington Westerners, a literary group, next 
Saturday, takes after his grandfather, Jesse James Jr., who was also a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"He always said he had a built-in clientele as a defense attorney," Ross said. 
"What criminal wouldn't trust Jesse James Jr.?" 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, innovative Southern Californians have formed such 
dual-interest social organizations as the Atheist Dating Service, Southern 
California Freeway Singles, Vege-Gay (gay vegetarians), Lesbian Back-packers 
and the Millionaire Singles Club. 
</P>
<P>
Now come two more entries: 
</P>
<P>
A pro-marijuana organization in Van Nuys advertises that its meetings offer the 
chance for "networking" and for making "new friends" (stoned singles?). 
</P>
<P>
And, in La Verne, a John Birch Society Summer Camp is being organized to give 
"young Americans a concentrated, six-day course in American values." 
</P>
<P>
So you think the pressure is on the Lakers in their bid for a third straight

T-shirts that say, "Three-peat"?

ARMY TROOPS FIRE ON BEIJING CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeing the televised excerpts of demonstrations at the various Communist 
Chinese embassies and consulates throughout the United States, I noticed that 
the demonstrators appear to be almost exclusively people of Chinese descent. 
This disturbs me. Although the fight for freedom in Communist China is 
primarily the responsibility of the Chinese people, it is a fight that should 
be actively supported by all people who cherish freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I believe that if freedom-loving Chinese citizens are willing to 
take a bullet in the back at Tian An Men Square, the least I can do is 
demonstrate in support of their cause in front of the Chinese consulate on a 
safe street in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On June 4th I was one of the relatively few Caucasians at the demonstration in 
front of the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. A makeshift memorial was 
assembled consisting of candles, flowers and a makeshift coffin. As I stood 
near the coffin, a young man of Chinese descent, wearing a black shirt, 
approached the memorial. On the back of his shirt was the color photograph that 
appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times showing the Goddess of 
Democracy statue in Tian An Men Square with the large picture of Mao in the 
background. After leaving a flower near the candles, the young man placed a 
small American flag on the coffin and quietly walked away. 
</P>
<P>
My eyes were filled with tears.

FILIPINOS IN THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your article "Filipinos -- A Search for Community," Part I, May 
24: 
</P>
<P>
I take issue with this headline if you meant that the Filipinos have not yet 
found their community. We have a dynamic community that will be a major player 
in the socioeconomic and political future of this country. This community 
collectively clamored for my judicial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
When you discussed the absence of a Filipino town, you did not mention that we 
are not a nation of shopkeepers. Since we have a special kinship with our 
fellow Asians we patronize their businesses. Historically, culturally, by 
training and education, we are service-oriented. There is no need for us to 
live in enclaves nor work in a Filipino town. Without the language and cultural 
barriers, we easily blend into the mainstream. Even without community support, 
we can compete effectively in the professional marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we have numerous dialects and cultures, but this is precisely what makes 
the Filipino nation so vibrant and culturally rich. In the same vein, the 
greatness of the American people lies in their diversity. Consequently, 
Filipinos are adaptable to any social, economic or political setting. Filipinos 
understand each other. 
</P>
<P>
It may be true that in some of their association politics they expressed 
themselves passionately in what they believe in. But they respect each other's 
right to disagree. Is this not what democracy is all about? 
</P>
<P>
We love and respect our manongs (elders). We insist that they live with us in 
our homes. 
</P>
<P>
Our seniors were the victims of California's anti-miscegenation law prohibiting 
intermarriages between Asians and whites. They had comported themselves with 
restraint but when the war came they fought gallantly side by side with their 
American brothers. We demonstrated again the same gallantry and restraint in 
our recent People's Power revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Filipinos place a high price on their children's education. Parents 
instinctively deny themselves the luxury of the good life just so the kids can 
go to the best schools. I am proud to say that our children have lived up to 
our highest expectations so that some day one of them will be president of this 
great country.

I am a student from China attending a university here. Twenty-four hours after 
the Communist Party in China began its massacre, I called my family in Beijing. 
Here is what my uncle, a factory manager, told me: 
</P>
<P>
"It was even worse than what you have been hearing. The death toll is not just 
in the thousands, but in the tens of thousands. The army did not confine its 
murderous action only to Tian An Men and the students there, but began the 
killing on its march into the central square, firing directly at innocent 
people wherever they happened to be gathered, as if all of us were the enemy. 
Stay there in America. We are all revolutionaries now. Please ask the American 
government and the American people to support us." 
</P>
<P>
Please, people of America, help us in our hour of need.

PEANUT BUTTER'S POPULARITY SPREADING ACROSS THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was so happy to read your article about the spreading popularity of peanut 
butter ("Peanut Butter Obsession Spreading Across Country," by David Treadwell, 
Part I, May 30). Now that it is no longer considered kid stuff, millions of 
adult peanut butter fanatics like myself can finally come out of the closet and 
reclaim this wholesome and delicious stuff for ourselves.

ARMY TROOPS FIRE ON BEIJING CROWDS

<P>
As I watched the killing and maiming of the young in China and waited for our 
government's democratic outrage, I began to wonder if we haven't lost something 
quite dear as well. It was the loss of some of our democratic spirit as our 
leaders coolly and calculatedly made their tepid response of "deploring the 
situation" in between boat rides in Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
We were told by our government that it was not in our "best interest" to be too 
strong in our condemnation. We have "strategic military interests in China" 
that must be "preserved." We have the beginning of economic trade that is 
profitable to us. And our own President must maintain the special ties of 
friendship he has developed with the current leadership in China because it is 
to our "advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Everything that was said made some intellectual sense. But where was our 
democratic soul? Could we see young people shot in the back and crushed by 
government tanks because they advocated the ideas of our own Thomas Jefferson 
and think only of our special economic and military interests? Could we see a 
government eat its young alive and feel nothing but fear for our business 
interests? 
</P>
<P>
During the election of 1988, we heard a lot about saluting the flag and 
respecting our country. Why can't we now hear something about respecting our 
democratic heritage and defending the people who espouse our ideals? Why 
doesn't our government feel some responsibility for its rhetoric about freedom 
that may have led the youth of China to act upon our ideals to their detriment? 
Have we gained economic and military power only to lose our democratic soul?

United States should terminate all relationships with the present fascist 
government in China. Those officials are not the legitimate government, they 
are ruthless, barbaric butchers. They do not represent the people of China. 
</P>
<P>
The blood of those unarmed students in Tian An Men Square will not be shed in 
vain. 
</P>
<P>
The democracy movement in China does not end, it just begins. American people 
should stand up and give them moral support in every way we can. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing we can do is to urge our government to stop all the military, 
financial, and technical aid until a more humanistic government is seen in 
China.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN PAIGE SAID HE WAS READY, HE WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of people thought it was a gimmick when owner Bill Veeck of the Cleveland 
Indians signed 42-year-old Satchel Paige during the 1948 season, but 
player-manager Lou Boudreau found out differently, and it didn't take long. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 8 o'clock in the morning at Municipal Stadium," Boudreau told Bill 
Parrillo of the Providence Journal. "I met Satch and told him, 'OK, you can do 
a little running to get loose.' He just shook his head and said, 'No need to 
run, Mr. Lou' -- he always called me Mr. Lou -- 'I'm ready now.' 
</P>
<P>
"I stepped into the cage," said Boudreau, who batted .355 that season, "and 
Satch must have thrown maybe 15-20 pitches. I think I hit one or two out of the 
cage. Right then, I knew he could help us." 
</P>
<P>
Paige went 6-1 with a 2.48 earned-run average, and Cleveland won the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Big Stuff: How big is Mark Eaton of the Utah Jazz? "If you go to the movies 
with him," says Johnny Kerr, announcer for the Chicago Bulls, "you get in for 
half price." 
</P>
<P>
It-had-to-happen Dept.: Said San Francisco announcer Ron Fairly, with Eddie 
Murray at bat during the Dodger-Giant series: "He can't risk going inside to 
Murray." 
</P>
<P>
The next pitch was outside. Home run. 
</P>
<P>
Add Fairly: His partner in the booth is Duane Kuiper, who got off this one 
recently: "It's a fine game in which there haven't been a lot of home runs. In 
fact, there haven't been any." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who scored the winning touchdown in this year's Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Add trivia: George Kiseda of Los Angeles asks: "Who was Vic Eaton?" 
</P>
<P>
He was the quarterback the Pittsburgh Steelers kept instead of John Unitas to 
play third string behind Jim Finks and Ted Marchibroda. 
</P>
<P>
Kiseda: "Walt Kiesling, the Steeler coach, said Eaton was more valuable than 
Unitas because he could punt." 
</P>
<P>
Just Say No: From Grambling football Coach Eddie Robinson, explaining why he 
hasn't had any drug problems with his players: "I have a meeting with them 
every year, and I explain to them that when you use drugs, you lose your sex 
drive. You should see how big their eyes get." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: If George Foreman gets a shot at Mike Tyson and comes in 
at his targeted weight of 263 pounds, he will be the heaviest challenger ever. 
</P>
<P>
Primo Carnera came in at 260 1/2 when he took the heavyweight title from Jack 
Sharkey in 1933. He weighed 270 when he defended the title against Tommy 
Loughran. Loughran gave away 86 pounds but went the 15-round distance. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: John Taylor, San Francisco 49ers wide receiver, on a 10-yard 
pass from Joe Montana. 
</P>

Quotebook: Sam Snead, 77, on why he doesn't play on the Senior PGA Tour: "It's

Let's face it, last year it was Kirk Gibson. This year it's Eddie Murray. The 
Dodgers are not a one-man team, they are a team that has simply forgotten they

FRED ROGGIN'S HUMOR BELONGS IN LOCKER ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with Larry Stewart's comments regarding Fred Roggin's penchant for low 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that detracts from Roggin's work is his ongoing lack of respect 
for women. If a bikini-clad woman is in attendance at a sporting event, Roggin 
will comment: 
</P>
<P>
 -- There will be no tittering about this play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The play was busted up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's a good day for a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's just trying to keep us abreast of sports. 
</P>
<P>
One expects humor like this in a junior high locker room, but it has no place 
in a news broadcast.

GRANGE OUT OF RANGE FOR THE AVERAGE DUFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In all my golf experiences I have never heard the expression a Red Grange, 
which was referred to in the June 6 Morning Briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is because, in my circles, if someone were to shoot a Red Grange 
(a 77, after Grange's uniform number) he would be either deified or accused of 
altering his scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, as the self-proclaimed voice of the average duffer, I offer a new 
terminology to the world of golf, a phrase that might soon be heard on the 
links of America with alarming frequency: I just had a Mark Gastineau (No. 99).

THREE BEAT RAIN AND SHARE LEAD IN SOGGY WESTCHESTER

<TEXT>
<P>
First-round leader Tom Sieckemann, Australian Wayne Grady and Dick Mast shared 
the lead at eight-under-par 134 Friday before rain halted play in the 
Westchester golf tournament at Harrison, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Sieckman shot a one-under-par 70, Gray a 65 and Mast a 68. 
</P>
<P>
A steady rain flooded portions of the Westchester Country Club course and 
forced a suspension of play with 99 players in the field of 157 still out or 
awaiting their starting times. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain and strong wind knocked out power and blew down trees at the Senior 
Tournament Players Championship in Ponte Vedra, Fla., but couldn't stop Gary 
Player. 
</P>
<P>
The three-time Masters champion shot a six-under-par 66 on the 6,646-yard TPC 
at Sawgrass Valley course for a 134 total and a one-stroke lead over Butch 
Baird, who shot a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Rizzo recorded 14 points for the second straight day and took a two-point 
lead over Myra Blackwelder, 28-26, in the LPGA Pat Bradley tournament at High 
Point, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Clemson Tigers, taking advantage of poor play by first-round leader Arizona 
and a favorable ruling, held a five-stroke lead after two rounds of the 1989 
NCAA championship at Edmond, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson led the way for Clemson with a one-under-par 69 that gave him the 
two-day individual lead with a 135 total, but Johnson had to survive two 
inquiries by NCAA and tournament officials regarding a problem with his 
scorecard that could have resulted in his disqualification.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TAKING SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY CAN PAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Many months ago, I read about the differences between beginning 
Social Security payments at age 62 versus age 65. I thought I read that it 
would take 12 years to make up the difference between the two payment 
schedules. Is this true? -- M. O'D. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes, but let's walk through all the math to show why. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Social Security Administration, if you start collecting Social 
Security payments at age 62, your monthly checks will be about 20% less than 
the amount you would have received if you had started drawing benefits at age 
65. In exchange for the lower monthly benefit, the recipient collects an 
additional 36 payments. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an example of how the system works. Let's say a retiree is entitled to 
an $800 monthly benefit at age 65. If he retires at age 62, that benefit would 
be reduced to $640, a difference of $160 per month. Not taking into account 
cost-of-living adjustments, the 62-year-old beneficiary would collect a total 
of $23,040 by the time he reached age 65. Again, not taking into account any 
annual adjustments, it would take 12 years at the higher monthly benefit for 
the 65-year-old retiree to make up the $23,040 received by the 62-year-old. So 
after age 77, the later retiree finally starts reaping the benefits of delaying 
his Social Security payments. 
</P>
<P>
When to take Social Security payments can be one of the most difficult 
decisions a retiree faces. Of course, if you think you will live fairly long, 
it makes sense to wait until age 65 to start receiving benefits. However, 
because predicting longevity is, at best, imprecise, it makes sense to look at 
other factors. 
</P>
<P>
One issue of great importance to many retirees is the amount of money they may 
earn while still collecting full Social Security benefits. Currently, 
regulations allow retirees under age 65 to earn up to $6,480 each year and 
still keep full benefits. However, retirees aged 65 to 69 may earn up to 
$8,880. There is no earnings limit for retirees aged 70 and older. Under 
current Social Security regulations, retirees with earned income -- this does 
not include dividends and interest payments -- above the limits for their ages 
lose $1 of Social Security benefits for every $2 of earnings. In 1990, they 
will lose $1 for every $3 earned above the limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Track Income of Investment Clubs 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am thinking of starting an investment group with some friends, but the 
bookkeeping logistics have me stumped. How do investment clubs handle the 
reporting of dividends and sales income for their members? -- J. P. 
</P>
<P>
A: We took your question to Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the board of trustees 
for the National Assn. of Investor Clubs, for an authoritative answer. 
According to O'Hara, whose organization has overseen the creation of thousands 
of investment clubs, virtually all clubs are organized as simple general 
partnerships that pool members' contributions and invest them, typically in the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Someone within each group is designated as the treasurer or bookkeeper, and it 
is the job of this person to keep track of the club's expenses, its trades and 
the dividend income generated by the investments. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara says that after organizing as a partnership, the groups usually petition 
the Internal Revenue Service for exemption from reporting income on IRS Form 
1065, the partnership income form. If the exemption is granted -- and it 
usually is -- the treasurer keeps track of dividend payments and any income, or 
losses, generated by the trades. At the end of the year, the treasurer 
determines each partner's share of the total. It is the responsibility of each 
member to report that share on his or her income tax filing. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, ask the investment club association for its free 
pamphlet. The address is 1515 East Eleven Mile Road, Royal Oak, Mich. 48067. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Basis a Factor in Holding Stock 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last year, when my wife retired, she received a lump-sum distribution of 
3,000 shares of her company's stock, which was then selling for $21 a share. 
Since then, the stock has traded for between $20 and $22 a share. The stock 
pays a dividend whose annual yield is about 3.5%. I have been urging her to 
sell the stock and invest the proceeds in our money market fund, which will 
give us a greater return. She wants to hold onto the shares for future 
appreciation. We really don't need the money because we have an annual income 
of about $62,000. But I just feel that we are losing about $4,000 a year by 
holding the stock. Do you have any advice? -- R. T. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: You haven't told us everything we need to know to give a full answer. 
Namely, we don't know what your taxable basis in these shares is. If your wife 
received these shares throughout the course of her employment at the company, 
it is likely that her taxable basis in these shares is quite low. If that is 
the case, you could owe a substantial amount of tax on the stock's 
appreciation. Under these circumstances, the personal finance advisers we 
consulted recommend that you hold onto the stock, since you don't need the 
additional income. 
</P>
<P>
However, if your taxable basis is the value of the shares at the date of 
distribution, $21 each, our advisers say you would be wise to consider a sale. 
But the advisers urge you not to invest in a money market fund that will give 
you more taxable income. They note that you already are in the highest income 
tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Our advisers say you should consider putting the proceeds in a tax-sheltered 
account. They come in many flavors these days. A simple one might be a 
tax-deferred annuity offered by many investment companies. Consult your 
accountant or enlist the aid of a qualified financial planner for help in 
selecting the right investment for you.

<P>
Stock prices were little changed Friday as the market absorbed the news of a 
bigger-than-expected increase in producer prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials slipped 3.49 to 2,513.42, finishing the 
week with a net loss of 4.41. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 173.24 million shares, down from 212.31 million 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of finished goods 
rose 0.9% in May, substantially outpacing advance estimates by brokerage-firm 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the news dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve would continue 
any time soon with what in recent days seemed to be the start of a move to 
relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some observers said they were impressed with the market's 
relatively calm reaction to the news. Unexpected jumps in the producer price 
index earlier this year touched off sharp declines in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The blow apparently was cushioned this time by several factors, including 
continued strength of the dollar in foreign exchange and a strong bond market. 
</P>
<P>
USX ranked among the volume leaders, up 1 at 38 on renewed speculation that 
financier Carl C. Icahn, who has a large stake in the company, might be 
planning a takeover or some other transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Syntex, a frequent subject of takeover talk, gained 2 to 54. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Containers Ltd. jumped 4 7/8 to 65 1/4. The company rejected an unsolicited 
offer from the European companies Tiphook PLC and Stena AB. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, down 7/8 
at 108 3/8; General Motors, down 1/4 at 41 1/4, and Eastman Kodak, down 1/2 at 
50 3/8. Kodak shares had run up lately on takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices ended the session slightly lower in thin trading Friday on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange, still shadowed by the upheaval in China. The Nikkei 
225-share index, which gained 91.40 Thursday, fell 78.31 to 33,639.98. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on London's stock exchange recovered to end mixed after the sharp rise 
in U.S. producer prices pushed the market lower. The Financial Times 100-share 
index fell 1.3 to 2,142.1. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar soared against major foreign currencies in a powerful buying wave 
touched off by the unexpectedly high producer price index, strength in the bond 
market and continuing tension in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices sank as much as $15 an ounce amid profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
John McCarthy, chief dealer at the New York office of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, 
said currency dealers drove the dollar past several psychologically significant 
thresholds against the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of trading in New York, the dollar stood at 2.010 marks, up from 
1.9725 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The PPI figure, which exceeded economists' estimates, revived speculation that 
U.S. interest rates might have to remain high for now to prevent inflation from 
veering out of control. High U.S. rates make returns on dollar-denominated 
investments attractive, which tends to encourage dollar buying. 
</P>
<P>
Before the report, a belief was spreading that the Federal Reserve would soon 
relax its guarded credit stance and allow interest rates to recede. 
</P>
<P>
Bullion dealers said the market reacted to the higher dollar by selling to 
profit on the precious metal's gains earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $363.25 an ounce, compared to $373.25 late 
Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold closed at a bid of $368.05, compared to 
$374.35 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Later on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
fell to $358.10 from Thursday's settlement of $373.50. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged, pushing long-term interest rates to their lowest level in 
more than two years despite the bigger-than-expected rise in a key inflation 
indicator. 
</P>
<P>
The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond climbed by about 1.625 points, or $16.25 
for every $1,000 in face amount. 
</P>
<P>
The bond's yield skidded to 8.14% -- the lowest since it finished at 8.06% on 
April 9, 1987 -- and down from 8.29% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the federal funds rate slipped to 9.125%, down from 9.375% late 
Thursday. The funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other for 
short-term loans. The Federal Reserve can influence the rate by buying or 
selling securities in the open market, thereby adding to or draining the 
reserves within the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of precious metals futures plunged on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
with both gold and silver reaching new contract lows. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybean prices were mostly lower, livestock prices 
were higher, meat futures were lower and energy prices slipped. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's producer price index report, many economists had predicted a 
moderate-to-brisk 0.5% gain in the index. Selling in the futures markets 
snowballed during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $15.40 to $18.80 lower, with the contract for delivery in June at 
$358.10 an ounce; silver was 28.1 to 33.5 cents lower, with June at $5.162 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest decline we've had in a year," said Craig Sloane, an 
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "It is also a disappointment 
for all those who thought Tuesday's rally, the best this year, was a sign the 
market had bottomed out and was starting an upswing." 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices jumped $13.60 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the Chicago Board of 
Trade, with wheat futures breaking out of a three-day slump caused by 
conditions in China. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices also reacted to weekend weather forecasts that call for heavy rain 
in winter wheat crop areas, analysts said. The rain is expected to interfere 
with harvesting.

<P>
A LONG 'SUNDAY IN THE PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prediction: "Sunday in the Park With George" will eventually be performed as a 
one-act, leaving out the modern adventures of "George" completely. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Groener is "George" in South Coast Repertory's lovely revival of Stephen 
Sondheim and James Lapine's 1984 musical. First, Groener plays George Seurat, a 
painter so obsessed with his work that he probably would have sacrificed his 
grandmother to it, let alone a mistress or two. (Sally Spencer plays his 
mistress.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, after intermission, Groener plays another George, a young 1980s artist 
who may be descended from Seurat. This George takes his grandmother (Spencer in 
an old-lady wig) to his openings. Where his ancestor didn't sell a single 
canvas in his lifetime, this George has hustled so many foundation grants for 
his "chromalumes" (light sculptures) that he is sick of the whole business. 
</P>
<P>
Next to his ancestor, George II is a mope. Despite some amusing satire of the 
art racket, the second act of "Sunday in the Park" feels as if it had been 
written to fill out the other side of the record. 
</P>
<P>
Act I is the evening, and it is a delight to see it in a small theater, unmiked 
and unhyped. "Sunday in the Park" was superbly performed on Broadway -- more so 
than it is here. But the original production was almost too precise. Barbara 
Damashek's staging is warmer and more relaxed. The story gets a chance to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't lose its edge. George is a still a self-centered, uncompromising 
artist who can see people only as figures in a landscape -- the famous "Sunday 
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." 
</P>
<P>
But here it's possible to see George himself as a figure in a landscape, as 
part of the human comedy on view every Sunday afternoon at the river bank. He 
is no more obsessed than the dog sniffing the grass, the soldier eyeing the 
nursemaid, or the old lady spying a good seat under the tree. Everybody is on 
the hunt. It's how we're made. 
</P>
<P>
Groener also gives George credit for having a limited amount of feeling (as 
much as he can afford) for his model, Dot. And he makes it clear that this is a 
man who doesn't give a damn about having a "career," in the 1980s sense of the 
term. All he wants to do is paint. Why can't anyone understand that? 
</P>
<P>
Groener's George has the ruthless simplicity of a Shaw hero, and even looks a 
little like the young G.B.S. -- fierce of beard, but mild of eye. Underneath 
there's an obedient boy struggling not to get out. Fine detailing here. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday in the Park" obviously can't be done coarsely. The problem would be not 
to get too precious. Sondheim's score, for example, is so tightly controlled, 
in imitation of Seurat's brush, that it could easily sound academic -- and 
sometimes did on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the ensemble sits to the side of George's "picture," as though a band 
were playing in the park that afternoon. When George freezes his composition, 
the musicians freeze too. That's charming, visually, but what's more important 
is that Sondheim's music flows, like a good dry wine at a picnic. Feelings 
don't gush, but they are in the air. We can see why the story wanted to be 
sung. Musical director Dennis Castellano deserves the appreciation here. 
</P>
<P>
Also the show's designers -- Shigeru Yaji (costumes), Cliff Faulkner (set), Tom 
Ruzika (lighting). We need the sense of a magical canvas that people can step 
into and out of, and we get it. 
</P>
<P>
The SCR company is big and generally well-cast. Spencer's Dot doesn't have the 
raucous undertones that one would expect from a cocotte, but isn't that a 
cliche? This Dot is pretty, neatly dressed and very much her own mistress, no 
matter whom she's sleeping with. Her first number, as she's posing for George, 
seems strangely contrived; but after that she's at home with the role and we're 
at home with her. 
</P>
<P>
Among the supporting players, you will notice Richard Doyle, in a nicely 
idiomatic performance as George's friend Jules, the play's Salieri figure. 
Other people you will notice for not having as firm a grip on their roles as 
they should. "Sunday in the Park" combines easiness and fierce concentration, 
and not all the company can handle its formal demands. 
</P>
<P>
But when George finally balances his canvas, and Sondheim's music reaches its 
long-sought harmony, there is a thrilling sense of arrival. After that, I 
personally would have been glad to call it a night. Why does every musical have 
to be three hours long? 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30. Matinees Saturdays and 
Sundays at 2:30. Tickets $17-$30. Closes July 16. 655 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. (714) 957-4033.

UNMODEST $53 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed Paul Grein's May 31 article on Bette Midler and the success she and 
the "Beaches" sound track album have earned. However, I do take umbrage at one 
paragraph: "The smash success of the . . . album is surprising because the film 
. . . was only a modest hit and has long since disappeared from movie screens." 
</P>
<P>
The May 31 Daily Variety Film Boxoffice Report lists "Beaches" at No. 11 and 
still making money with a plus 163% change and grossing well over $53 million 
in 160 days since its release. There's nothing "modest" about $53 million. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is still playing on 345 screens and just opened to good reviews in 
Britain and Australia.

LES MORMONS UNDER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shouldn't your headline have been "Les Mormons Attack Prejudice With 
Prejudice"? 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Mormon Church's legitimate rejection of homosexual activity, 
these "artists" condemn it. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to freedom of religion, or is that only for the dissidents while 
the faithful are forced to abandon what they believe? Is the "intolerance" Les 
Mormons derogate any different from the intolerance they practice?

Thanks, but I don't need Daniels and York to show me how I as a woman am 
"suppressed." Let's compare notes in 10 years and see who has had the happier, 
more fulfilling, more contributing life -- they, the cross-dressed iconoclasts, 
or me, whose mother was "taught to make sure (I went) to Home Ec."

VIRGIN RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a nurse in Sweden and since suffering a back injury in 1972 I have been 
through surgery twice and have had to spend a lot of time in bed with severe 
pain. The only things I can spend much time with are reading and listening to 
music. Roy Orbison's music has been such a consolation to me. 
</P>
<P>
In December, my son told me that Roy Orbison had died. I felt I had lost a dear 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I made a tape recording, in English. I spoke from my heart, about my 
feelings toward Roy Orbison, and I sent the tape with a letter to Virgin 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
In May I received a wonderful letter from Paule Micallef (international manager 
of Virgin Records) thanking me and promising that Roy's widow, Barbara, would 
get my tape and letter. She also enclosed a CD of "Mystery Girl" in a beautiful 
package with Roy's photo and some lovely words about him as an artist and as a 
man. I was very moved, and I cried. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin proved that a big company can keep in touch with the small people "out 
there." Thank you, Virgin. I will never forget.

UCLA VISION '89 SHOWCASES PROMISING FILM MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year-end outpouring of student films is always a grab bag, but some elements 
are constant: idealism and raw energy, awkwardness and sincerity, 
overreachingly lofty ideas and good simple ones. To judge by the works 
prescreened for the weeklong UCLA Vision '89, opening tonight, some lovely 
talent is coming to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, which opens with a tribute to director and teacher Dorothy Arzner, 
contains two personal favorites. "Sand Dance" is an animation done literally 
with sand, although heaven alone knows how, since Richard Quade's little, 
longing jazz dancer seems even more evocative than a drawn character. "Sand 
Dance" is so deft, so technically challenging and so charming, it's not 
surprising that its four fascinating minutes have already won this year's 
student film award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the 
animation division. Do not miss this. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is "Caruthers," a character study of an engaging, rather marginal 
singer working a desolate job somewhere in a Death Valley roadhouse, and the 
sultry, enigmatic young woman who crosses his path. This is all atmosphere, 
longing, delicate innuendo, with a pair of full-blown performances, by Tom 
McCray and Audrey Wells, that are absolute knockouts. Writer-director Bruce 
Muller is masterly in his handling of actors, at mood and telling detail; a 
little less brilliant at hard-core storytelling. But as this bittersweet 
evocation catches you, it may make you, too, forgiving of its rather wispy 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
Also tonight is "Arena," Niel Mueller's ambitious, fragmented story about a 
frenetic stand-up comedian (Joe Marinelli) who turns everything into fodder for 
his routines. It's given him control on stage and chaos when he's off. Although 
Marinelli is lively, the outstanding moments belong to Talia Balsam as the 
put-upon love of his life, and at almost 40 minutes the film begins to spin its 
wheels even more emptily than its hero does. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's documentary evening begins with "China Diary," an already interesting 
film that has had the white heat of topicality thrust upon it. Film maker 
Jinhua Yang, raised in China during the cultural revolution, went back to 
Beijing and Shanghai in late 1986 after five years of study in the United 
States and found things so radically changed that her astonishment echoes 
throughout her film. Yang reels from an individually owned beauty parlor to a 
radiator factory and a rural hotel now owned by "the peasants." She encounters 
the richest peasant entrepreneur of a small town living in a house with 
catalogue-ordered Louis XIV furniture and toy dogs for his children, all with 
their heavy plastic slipcovers intact. "I don't know what to make of this 
economic success," Yang broods. 
</P>
<P>
Even more suspect is a swimsuit-judged beauty contest for the government 
airlines, who press film maker Yang into jury duty as a visiting celebrity. The 
once-unthinkable unveiling of all this flesh leaves her shaken and sad: "Is 
this real beauty?" she worries. No, but it's real capitalism. If you want to 
meet some of the people and understand some of the ferment behind the tragedy 
we've all been watching on television, try "China Diary." It's riveting. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Two films, Molly A. Strange's "Dream of the Unbroken," and 
Edgar Michael Bravo's "Mi Casa," seem wrenched out of personal feeling. In the 
first, the subject is incest and sexual molestation, as an 11-year-old daughter 
deals with her torrential feelings. Abandonment is also the concern of the 
brief second film as an 8-year-old Mexican boy in Los Angeles watches his 
family disintegrate. Bravo inclines toward the stagy, but his ending is 
desolate and real and so is the actor playing the father. 
</P>
<P>
You may feel you've gone through the Angst of one of the Wednesday-night 
entries, Javier Gomez-Serrano's "An Unhappy Ending," more than once before in 
student films, but the power of this aphoristic love/death story comes from the 
director's splendid eye, from the beautiful black-and-white photography and 
from the exceptionally haunting and inventive musical score. 
</P>
<P>
Melodrama seems to have afflicted the two prescreened Thursday-night films like 
flu germs. Angela Barton's earnest, self-righteous "Taking the Rap for Eve" 
plays like outtakes from a '60s consciousness-raising session, but it's a lot 
less fun. "Il Finale" by Russell Martin, about two Cuban emigres trying to 
rebuild their lives in Los Angeles, begins very interestingly but, as one man 
finds a job and his lover holds out for a more worthy one, the story turns into 
purest soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
The program ends Saturday with a show of strength, after a tribute to UCLA 
alumnus Colin Higgins. Donald Bull's "The Last Five Hours," a contemporary 
criss-crossed romance, is genuinely comic and genially cool; its three 
principal actors -- Kenny Ransom, Laura Hinto and Kevin Han Yee -- are 
splendid, with Ransom's beleaguered boyfriend particularly memorable. In 
"Twilight" Scott Alberts animates a walk through the woods at that magic time 
with a pair of friendly children and turns it into an affectionate, Dr. 
Seuss-like event. Donald Matos' "The Other Side" about three Latino street kids 
and a white horse is marked by extraordinary black-and-white photography by 
David Swett and real affinity for the subject. Then there's director Steve 
Anderson's "Hearts of Stone," which imagines Los Angeles gang warfare settled 
by combat between a "warrior" from each faction and a game of Russian roulette. 
Anderson, too, is stronger than his dialogue (skip this if realistically raw 
language offends you) but powerful at evoking mood and tension. 
</P>

Each night's starting time is different, so be advised to check: (213) 825-8710 
or 206-5331.

DAY HIKE: SURVEY A PATH OF OLD WEST HISTORY HIGH IN SIMI HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the major obstacles to stagecoach travel between Los Angeles and San 
Francisco was a route out of the west end of the San Fernando Valley over the 
Simi Hills. About 1860, a steep road was carved out of the rock face of the 
hills. The steepest stretch, a peril to man and beast, was known as Devil's 
Slide. 
</P>
<P>
The slide, the old stage road and a portion of the Simi Hills are preserved in 
a park-in-the-making just west of Chatsworth. In 1989, the state purchased 400 
acres in the Santa Susana Pass area and added it to another 400 acres of 
state-owned parkland. Eventually, Santa Susana State Park will be staffed with 
rangers and have recreation facilities. The park represents two decades of 
organizing and lobbying by San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley 
environmentalists, spearheaded by the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana as a park name is a bit confusing because the park is in the Simi 
Hills, not the nearby Santa Susana Mountains, which are protected by the park. 
Visually, the Simi Hills, with their skyscraping sedimentary rock formations, 
are quite different from the rounder, taller Santa Susana Mountains to the 
north of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The reddish-orange sandstone outcroppings of the Simi Hills, dating from the 
Mesozoic Era millions of years ago, form a dramatic backdrop for the park. It's 
easy to see why these rugged hills were a popular setting for Western movies. 
</P>
<P>
The hills overlook Chatsworth, named after Chatsworth, England. Founded in the 
1880s, it became a community of vegetable patches, orchards, cattle and horse 
ranches. Although one of the West Valley's oldest towns, it has managed to hang 
on to its rural character better than most Valley communities. However, in 
recent years, residential subdivisions have begun covering the horse ranches 
and the lines of eucalyptus that once served as windbreaks for farms and 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
A network of trails loops through the park, but the trails are unsigned and 
more than a little confusing. During your first visit to the park, expect to 
improvise a bit. Once you get the lay of the land, subsequent visits will be 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From U.S. 101 (Ventura Freeway) in Woodland Hills, 
exit on Topanga Canyon Boulevard and drive 6 1/4 miles north to Devonshire 
Street. Turn left and proceed three-fourths of a mile to Chatsworth Park South, 
a city-owned park with wide lawns and picnic areas next to the new state park. 
</P>
<P>
If you're coming from California 118 (the Simi Valley Freeway), take the 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard exit in Chatsworth, drive 1 1/2 miles south to 
Devonshire Street and turn right to the park. 
</P>
<P>
As you drive up Devonshire, notice signed Stagecoach Trail, an equestrian 
trail. Leave your car and pick up this trail if you wish, but it's more 
convenient continuing to the ample parking area in the main part of Chatsworth 
Park South. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: From the parking lot, walk across the wide lawn or take one of the 
dirt paths that border the lawn. With the park recreation center directly 
behind you, navigate toward a couple of oaks and join a gravel path that begins 
just below a water tower on your right. 
</P>
<P>
Begin a moderate ascent. When presented with confusing choices and unsigned 
junctions, try to keep ascending straight up the hill. Don't drift too far to 
the south, where there's a line of electrical transmission towers, or too far 
to the north, where the Southern Pacific railroad tracks penetrate the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Half a mile from the trailhead, you'll intersect a paved road that winds up to 
a small hydroelectric pumping plant. You, however, will almost immediately 
abandon this road at a break in a chain-link fence near two telephone poles. 
Here you'll find the old stage road and begin to climb more earnestly toward 
Devil's Slide. A century ago, the road was in much better shape. 
</P>
<P>
Erosion has carved wagon-wheel-sized potholes into the soft rock. 
</P>
<P>
The Devil's Slide is more like the Devil's Stairs these days. 
</P>
<P>
Near the top of the slide is a historical marker placed by the Native Daughters 
of the American West commemorating "Old Santa Susana Stagecoach Road, 1859-90." 
</P>
<P>
This is a great place to pull up a rock, sit a spell and survey the San 
Fernando Valley, which spreads south and east. Just below is Chatsworth, a 
mixture of old ranchland and new townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
If you're lucky, you'll sight a freight or passenger train snaking through the 
Simi Hills and disappearing into the Santa Susana tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
After enjoying the view, you can continue another quarter of a mile up 
Stagecoach Trail and inspect the rest of Devil's Slide. 
</P>
<P>
Or retrace your steps and take a trail leading to the park's rock formations.

GRAPE-SWITCHING SCANDAL ROCKS STATE WINE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California wine industry's worst scandal in two decades has come to light 
in recent weeks as state authorities have accused a number of grape harvesters 
of selling inexpensive varieties as premium wine grapes. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of suits was filed Thursday by the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture, the result of a wide-ranging investigation during the 1988 
grape harvest. Shortages of premium wine grapes drove prices up for some 
varieties last year, but prices of non-premium grapes remained moderate. 
</P>
<P>
In several of the suits, the growers or harvesters are accused of passing off 
cheaper French colombard grapes as Chardonnays, which sell for more than eight 
times as much. In others, inexpensive red grapes were allegedly sold as 
zinfandels. Both Chardonnay and a blush wine made from zinfandels have become 
highly popular moderately priced wines in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been suspicions for some time that there were irregularities (with 
grapes) from some growers," said Frank Indelicato, co-owner of Delicato 
Vineyards in Manteca. "But it's gotten real bad in the last two years. Some 
people are trying to take advantage of the high prices for grapes." 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the problem is not yet known, but both federal and state 
authorities are continuing their investigations. It also is not entirely clear 
why some wineries apparently failed to detect the switch, or how much 
mislabeled wine -- if any -- made it to the marketplace. Industry sources say 
wine made from the grapes under suspicion was not of the expensive type, but 
rather fell among those that typically sell for $5 or less per bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Winery officials are clearly embarrassed by the situation, and some express 
concern about the effect the scandal could have on the industry's image. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 6,000 honest, hard-working grape growers in California and a couple 
of cases like this make all of us look bad, and that is causing a lot of 
bitterness in the grape-growing community," said Jim Ledbetter, owner of Vino 
Farms and president of the Sonoma County Grape Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Six civil cases have been filed so far by state agriculture officials, all in 
the San Joaquin Valley where virtually all of the state's cheaper wine grapes 
are grown. However, some of the allegedly inferior grapes or wine are believed 
to have wound up at wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties -- the state's most 
prestigious wine-producing areas, and federal investigators are known to be 
looking into some suspicious cases at a number of premium wineries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wineries Victimized 
</P>
<P>
The wineries themselves so far are not under investigation for switching 
grapes, and are considered to have been the victims. However, sources said the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a division of the Treasury 
Department that regulates the wine industry, is checking to see whether some 
wineries have mislabeled wine made from the suspect grapes. 
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that federal regulators have demanded that a number of 
California wineries show exactly what they did with any suspected misidentified 
grapes or the juice produced from them. Winery officials said they are 
cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities want to determine whether wineries that bought misidentified grapes 
or wine violated the federal "minimum varietal content" regulation. Federal 
rules require that wine bottled with a varietal designation (Chardonnay, for 
example, or white zinfandel) be made from at least 75% of that grape variety. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has the authority to suspend the 
license of any winery that knowingly bottles wine with a varietal designation 
made from less than 75% of the named variety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Suits Filed 
</P>
<P>
At least three private lawsuits also have been filed. In one, brewing giant 
Anheuser-Busch recently won an out-of-court settlement in Northern California 
after it claimed that an Escalon, Calif., grape harvester had sold it 
lesser-quality grapes labeled as premium zinfandels. The defendant agreed to 
pay nearly $1.1 million to settle the case after a government inspection 
determined that less than 23% of the grapes delivered to Anheuser-Busch were 
actually zinfandels. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials insist that the situation occurred in only a few instances 
in the San Joaquin Valley and could not happen in the premium wine areas (Napa, 
Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties, for example) where wineries and growers 
are closely linked by long-term contracts. "These are smaller communities where 
the growers know the wineries, people know each other, they eat together, 
they're friends," a spokesman for the Sonoma County Wineries Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the San Joaquin wineries are typically much larger and process 
huge amounts of grapes from many different growers. 
</P>
<P>
Ev Delfino, assistant director of inspection services for the state agriculture 
department, said evidence accumulated so far indicates that the problem was 
localized in the San Joaquin Valley. "The great majority of growers, 99 and 
nine-tenths of them, are clean. There is no large-scale misidentification of 
wine grapes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Issued 
</P>
<P>
Since about 1987, when the state's supply of Chardonnay and zinfandel began to 
dry up (in part because of a small harvest) and prices rose dramatically, the 
state has suspected that some grape growers and brokers might take advantage by 
selling cheaper grapes and passing them off as more costly varieties. In fact, 
the state Department of Food and Agriculture issued a public warning to growers 
and wineries early last year. 
</P>
<P>
State Assistant Atty. Gen. Mark Urban, a prosecutor in the six cases filed so 
far by the agriculture department, said the state is seeking a total of more 
than $1.2 million in damages, including penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Another six suspicious instances have been referred to the attorney general's 
office for possible prosecution, according to sources familiar with the 
investigation. (There is a one-year statute of limitations on grape-switching; 
all the cases filed so far refer to actions that allegedly occurred last 
summer.) 
</P>
<P>
In four of the six cases already filed, Bavaro Brothers, an Escalon-based grape 
harvester, and its owners, Nick J. Bavaro and Francisco Bavaro, among others, 
were named as defendants. A secretary said that on the advice of its lawyers 
the company would not comment on the cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zinfandel Producer 
</P>
<P>
Buyer of the grapes in three of the Bavaro cases was Delicato Vineyards, 
believed to be the state's largest white zinfandel producer and purchaser of 
80,000 tons of California wine grapes last year. Delicato sells much of its 
production -- 4.2 million gallons last year -- in bulk to other wineries, 
including Sutter Home, the state's largest marketer of white zinfandel under 
its own label. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the Bavaro firm is alleged to have sold French colombard grapes, 
which sold at a statewide average price of $138.79 per ton in 1988, as 
Chardonnays, for which the statewide average was $1,122.36 per ton. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, the state alleges that lower-priced carignan, valdepenas and 
grenache grapes were sold in different transactions and passed off as 
zinfandels. There was a difference of about $600 per ton in the price paid for 
those types of grapes last year. 
</P>
<P>
Winery owner Indelicato said vintners cannot always tell the type of grapes 
they are receiving, and therefore must rely on the representations of their 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we have suspicions, and we call the county (agricultural) 
commissioner over, some of the grapes are sent to (the viticulture laboratory 
at UC) Davis, and sometimes even professionals can't tell for sure. Just 
looking at the grapes, it's hard to tell. You have to analyze the seeds." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Steinhauer, viticulturist for Beringer Vineyards in the Napa Valley, 
agreed. "The three of us who buy grapes for Beringer inspect the vineyards to 
make certain that it's what the grower says it is. And we have a map on file of 
every vineyard we buy from, showing the varieties," Steinhauer said. "When the 
grapes are on the vine, it's fairly easy to tell what's zinfandel and what's 
not. But it's harder to tell when the grapes are in the gondola." 
</P>
<P>
Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma and Charles Krug in the Napa Valley, both 
premium wineries that bought grapes from the Bavaro firm, have filed lawsuits 
against it claiming that the grapes were misrepresented; each suit seeks $1 
million in damages. Both wineries said discussions are under way to settle 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Small Minority' 
</P>
<P>
"This does not represent the entire wine industry," said Robert Hartzell, 
president of the California Assn. of Winegrape Growers. "It's a small minority 
of growers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely unusual situation. . . . In the 12 years I've been 
president of (the grape growers), I've almost never seen the state need to step 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Hartzell said some growers do not believe that the state is being tough enough 
on the wrongdoers. "They think the perpetrators' hands aren't being slapped 
hard enough, that the penalties should be more severe. Both growers and 
vintners are deeply concerned that a few greedy people have misrepresented the 
varieties." 
</P>
<P>
The last time a scandal of this type hit the California wine industry was 
nearly 20 years ago when Almaden Vineyards, then located in San Jose, allegedly 
mislabeled wine that it sold to airlines. That case was settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Some wineries are upset that the authorities were slow to warn them that a 
significant amount of misidentification was occurring. In some cases, the 
warnings came after the wine was already blended with other wine. That means 
large quantities of wine could be suspect if it were labeled as varietal. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lost Hills Winery in Acampo said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms was slow in telling wineries of its concerns, "and we never knew 
until we had blended our tanks. . . . They should have told us. We could have 
held onto that wine until the percentages were certified. Now it's too late."

MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC CLOSURES CREATE TURMOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited closing Friday of three Los Angeles County mental health 
centers has permanently cut off hundreds of mentally ill people from treatment, 
triggering suicide threats, confusion and frantic calls by frightened mental 
patients to the overcrowded clinics that remain open, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the clients left stranded by the closings, only the "sickest of the 
sickest of the sick" will remain eligible for county help, said Dr. Milton 
Miller, chairman of the psychiatric department at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, 
which is accepting 250 patients from one of the shuttered clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a brutalization of the system," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packed Up Records 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists and therapists stopped seeing patients June 2, but the doors 
officially closed Friday when staff packed up records and cleaned up. The three 
clinics -- East San Fernando Valley Mental Health Center in North Hollywood, 
Coastal Community Mental Health Center in Carson and Wilmington Mental Health 
Center -- were slated for closure after the county won a contentious legal 
battle with mental health advocacy groups that wanted to preserve the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,175 patients were still on the rolls at the time the three centers 
closed, but supervisors said the total is just a fraction of the caseload the 
centers once handled before the staff started leaving and threats of closures 
started surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mental health providers throughout the county said they were shocked 
when county officials unveiled a new list of deeper cuts Thursday. Programs for 
the aged, children and minorities would be curtailed, and the San Fernando 
Valley would be left with almost no public mental health services. The $10.9 
million in proposed cuts, along with others already in the pipeline, would 
force the closure of six of the remaining 28 clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at at this point is a complete and utter disaster in the 
mental health system," said Dr. Ian Hunter, executive director of the San 
Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center. "The mental health system has 
gone insane." 
</P>
<P>
Among those stranded by the present closings are roughly 350 children, most 
sexually or physically abused, who had received counseling at the Coastal 
Mental Health Center. There was no other program that could absorb the large 
number of children needing help, said Joel Foxman, the center's director and 
chief of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what would happen to the children, Foxman replied, "I'm really 
afraid to consider the possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, about 300 of the 800 patients from the North 
Hollywood clinic have been referred to two county-funded, privately run clinics 
that have placed them on waiting lists. Administrators at the two clinics said 
there is little hope most of them will ever receive appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic officials said they have been receiving lots of calls from "bewildered, 
frustrated" patients since the centers closed. They also report a rash of 
suicide attempts and suicide threats since preparation for the closings began, 
although no one could quantify that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Begged for Help 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Escarcega, the head of the Valley's out-patient clinics, encountered 
one of the displaced patients at the closed North Hollywood center Friday 
afternoon. A couple with their mentally ill boy cornered Escarcega in the 
hallway and begged him to help. 
</P>
<P>
The father cried as the mother pleaded and clung to the stunned official. Their 
son, who needed more medicine, slumped to the floor. Escarcega broke policy 
rules and obtained an appointment for the boy that day at the county clinic in 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most disturbing event I have personally faced since this all 
began," said Escarcega, who presided over three meetings Thursday where many 
North Hollywood clinic staffers cried. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the Valley patients are being transferred to the county's 
understaffed Crisis Mangement Center in Van Nuys, where psychiatric emergencies 
are handled. The center shut its doors several hours early Monday because of an 
overcrowded waiting room -- a phenomenon that started earlier this year, said 
Ron Klein, the district chief of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Dependent on the state for most of its mental health money, county officials 
said they reluctantly ordered the closures when the mental health budget 
plunged hopelessly in the red after the state failed to provide the county 
enough money to keep the system afloat. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said further deterioration of the crippled mental health 
network could only be avoided with a large cash infusion. Another $15 million 
would spare all remaining programs. But under the cheeriest scenario, the 
county only expects at this point to receive an additional $5.4 million from 
the state, said Francis Dowling, deputy mental health director. Overall, the 
county spends roughly $300 million a year on mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not what we want to do, but we are forced to because of the failure of 
the state to come through with sufficient funds," Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Carroll, executive director of San Fernando Valley Legal Services, who 
filed the unsuccessful lawsuit against the county, said it is "very likely" he 
will sue again in light of the new cuts that he called "incredible." He 
suggested a state audit to trace where the county's mental health money is 
being spent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first round of closures has prompted the county to create 
tougher guidelines on who will qualify for help, officials said. It has also 
forced providers to cut back services to the bare bones. 
</P>
<P>
A person needing individual therapy might only receive group counseling. A 
person who needs therapy and medication may only get drugs. Appointments could 
be spaced further apart. 
</P>
<P>
One victim of the tougher guidelines is Mary, a 45-year-old woman who has been 
disabled by agoraphobia (an abnormal fear of being in open or public places) 
for 10 years. Unable to leave her house without someone accompanying her, she 
is subject to panic attacks and has never mentally recovered from an assault by 
an intruder in her home years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denied Help 
</P>
<P>
By letter, Mary was referred to the San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health 
Center. But on Monday, a staffer told her she was not sick enough to qualify 
for assistance because she was not on medications and had never been 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel my well-being has been very, very severely threatened," Mary said. "I 
am on a thin thread, not to just give up." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Comer, a mentally ill plaintiff in the Legal Services lawsuit, said a 
suicidal friend ended up in the hospital after blaming herself for the clinics' 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"She started burning herself with cigarettes when she heard voices that she was 
bad and that's why the clinic was closing," Comer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health professionals say the closings have already resulted in more 
hospitalizations and are beginning to overwhelm the county's emergency rooms 
and psychiatric wards. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Miller of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center said he dreads. Every night, 
physicians must turn away psychiatric patients who are not sick enough for a 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"We play a game of 'Sophie's Choice' night after night after night," Miller 
said. "It's a horrible job."

A gunman took eight people hostage in the visitor's center at the Old Faithful 
complex in Yellowstone National Park on Friday, but released them unharmed, the 
National Park Service said. The man surrendered to park rangers a few hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The eight hostages were freed about 6 p.m., almost three hours after the man, 
identified as Brett Hartley, 18, of Baton Rouge, La., drew a handgun at the 
visitor's center, said Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein. No shots 
were fired. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taking "was an expression of asking for help. Some people have a 
hard time asking for help," said park ranger Joe Evans. He said officers had 
weapons trained on the gunman until the hostages were released. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Hartley would be taken to a hospital at Jackson, Wyo., for a 
preliminary psychiatric examination.

WATT DENIES SELLING HIS INFLUENCE; 
</P>
<P>
IN ANGRY TESTIMONY, CALLS HUD CONSULTANT ROLE 'LEGAL, MORAL'

Former Interior Secretary James G. Watt testified Friday that as a consultant 
he and a partner made $300,000 for arranging a meeting with one of Watt's 
former Cabinet colleagues that led to the approval of a federal housing grant. 
But he denied that he abused the grant program through his influence. 
</P>
<P>
Angrily denying accusations by members of a House subcommittee that he engaged 
in influence peddling, Watt contended that the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development was paralyzed by indecision and said it took his efforts to break 
the logjam on his client's project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Am Proud of It' 
</P>
<P>
"My participation was legal, moral and effective," Watt told the House 
Government Operations Committee's housing subcommittee. "And I am proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Panel Chairman Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) strongly disagreed. He told Watt: "This 
project came into existence because of influence peddling by you." 
</P>
<P>
Watt testified at a hearing held in connection with a recent HUD inspector 
general's report, which concluded that a HUD program for rehabilitating 
low-income housing units was corrupted by favoritism during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. It charged that developers who hired prominent Republicans as 
consultants won contracts for projects, while applicants who did not have 
connections often could get no funding. 
</P>
<P>
Watt, once a leader in the so-called "sagebrush revolution" against the 
proliferation of federal government programs and activities, defended his role 
on behalf of a developer who had sought federal subsidies for a 312-unit 
housing project in Essex, Md. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the $300,000 consulting fee "seemed like a lot of money to 
me," and that his only service was setting up a meeting with Samuel R. Pierce 
Jr., then HUD secretary, to get the agency to consider the Maryland project and 
another developer's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Watt said he gave $131,000 of the $300,000 fee to an associate. 
</P>
<P>
Other former Reagan Administration officials have been convicted of illegally 
lobbying their former agencies within a year after leaving office. In Watt's 
case, however, it was not against the law for a former secretary of Interior to 
lobby the head of a different agency -- HUD. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying you broke the law," Rep. Christropher Shays (R-Conn.) told 
Watt. "I am saying to you this was a smelly system from which you benefited." 
</P>
<P>
Watt insisted that he was simply "a good man using his credibility to get a 
result." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) protested, saying: "There was no paralysis. 
You had influence. You were paid for your influence." 
</P>
<P>
Watt, who headed the Department of the Interior from 1980 to 1983, told the 
subcommittee that he had no experience as an attorney in housing matters when 
he took the consulting job for the developer. His access to Pierce, he agreed, 
was the key in prompting a review of the proposed federal grants that Watt said 
were blocked by bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that he got his fees from the developer and not from federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kemp, the former New York congressman who is now HUD secretary, has said 
the program appeared to be "based on the perception and reality of favoritism 
and abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Watt, however, challenged Kemp's view, saying: "There was no abuse. There was 
no illegality. There was nothing done wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) asserted that the government's costs for 
rehabilitation projects go up if developers' include their fees for consultants 
like Watt. 
</P>
<P>
"While what he did was within the law, it wasn't ethically attractive," Frank 
said afterward. "And we got confirmation from him that under Ronald Reagan HUD 
was a disgrace. The vaunted Republicans were guilty of absolute inefficiency, 
but they also created a climate in which influence peddling was rife." 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the stormy hearing, Watt declared: "I'm not on trial. I'm 
not here to defend the system. The system was flawed."

SWEDES HEAR PONTIFF STRESS 'RIGHT TO LIFE'

<P>
Once again preaching against the grain in liberal Scandinavia, Pope John Paul 
II on Friday proclaimed a womb-to-tomb "right to life" in a nation where 
government-sponsored abortions cost less than $10. 
</P>
<P>
In a day of speeches and a colorful Mass in the old university town of Uppsala, 
the Pope proclaimed the family as foundation of an ethical society, and termed 
marriage an unbreakable institution. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a 28-year-old member of an extremist Pentecostal sect as he 
rushed forward while the Pope distributed Communion at a hilltop Mass near 
Uppsala's medieval quarter. The man, whose sect distributed pamphlets 
denouncing ecumenism at the Mass, was not armed, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
With that exception, Swedes, whose views on issues of personal morality such as 
abortion, contraception and homosexuality are diametrically opposed to John 
Paul's, took history's first papal visit to Sweden in stride. An account of 
Friday's papal rounds was the sixth item on the national radio news. 
</P>
<P>
Half the couples living together in Sweden today are unmarried, divorce is 
routine and no stigma attaches to children born out of wedlock. Still, in a 
nation of 8.3 million that is home to about 150,000 Catholics, the Pontiff's 
moral message was undiluted. 
</P>
<P>
On his last full day in Scandinavia, John Paul appealed for "a new Christian 
humanism" in an address to a polite, blue-ribbon audience at 512-year-old 
Uppsala University that included the Swedish royal family and 15 Lutheran 
bishops. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a "growing moral consciousness," the Pope singled out Swede Raoul 
Wallenberg, who vanished from Soviet-held Hungary after saving thousands of 
Jews from concentration camps during World War II, as an example who "inspires 
a dedicated fight for human rights." 
</P>
<P>
"The dignity of the person can only be protected if the person is considered as 
inviolable from the moment of conception until natural death," the Pope said. 
"A person cannot be reduced to the status of a means or a tool of others. 
Society exists to promote the security and dignity of the person. Therefore, 
the primary right which society must defend is the right to life. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether in the womb or in the final phase of life, a person may never be 
disposed of in order to make life easier for others. Every person must be 
treated as an end to himself," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
As in the other Nordic countries John Paul has visited on a five-nation 
pilgrimage over the last 10 days, abortion is widely practiced here. Under 
Sweden's system of socialized medicine, abortion, like other procedures, is 
subsidized by the state. A patient pays 55 krona -- $8.33. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul appealed for "worldwide solidarity in the search for dignity and 
justice," insisting that "unless a society treats a human person as inviolable, 
the formulation of consistent ethical principles becomes impossible." 
</P>
<P>
In his homily at the Mass, the white-and-gold garbed John Paul termed marriage 
"an unbreakable covenant of total mutual self-giving" not subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
"The marriage contract is an unconditional and enduring covenant," he told 
worshipers who included Catholic immigrants to Sweden from countries such as 
Chile and Poland, as well as curious Swedes. Nearly all Swedes are Lutherans, a 
faith that allows divorce, but only about 5% of Swedes are regular churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
From the altar at Uppsala, 35 miles north of Stockholm, John Paul called for 
defense of the family as "a community of love and of life" and urged parents to 
"find opportunities for talking and sharing at a deep level with your 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope travels to Vadstena in central Sweden today to visit a church 
dedicated to the 14th-Century St. Bridget, a patron saint of Sweden. After a 
Mass for young people from all five Nordic countries to climax his 42nd foreign 
trip, John Paul returns to Rome this afternoon.

NO NEW GORBACHEV OFFER ON ARMS, AIDE INDICATES

<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov suggested here Friday 
that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not be offering any dramatic arms 
reduction proposals during his four-day visit to West Germany next week. 
</P>
<P>
Many Western observers had predicted that Gorbachev would climax his first 
appearance in the Federal Republic with a new initiative on weapons or troop 
cuts in Europe, partly to upstage President Bush and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in the East-West competition for Western European public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arrived in East 
Berlin on Friday to brief and reassure East German leaders about Gorbachev's 
first trip to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn to prepare for Gorbachev's much-ballyhooed visit, Gerasimov told a news 
briefing that the Soviet Union is not happy with remarks by Western officials 
that the Soviets should be "put to the test" in their advocacy of arms 
reductions in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're against using words like 'test,' " said Gerasimov. "We don't like them." 
</P>
<P>
As to whether Gorbachev might counter Bush's proposal to cut U.S. and Soviet 
forces in Europe to 275,000 on each side, which the President made during last 
week's NATO summit in Brussels, Gerasimov declared: "There are no reasons to 
demand a quick response from us during Mikhail Gorbachev's visit in Bonn." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to statements by Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III that Gorbachev should give his response to Bush's proposal during his West 
German trip. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov pointed out that the Bush Administration had taken several months to 
complete its review of foreign and national security policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't ask him to hurry up," said Gerasimov, ignoring repeated Soviet 
complaints about the slowness of the U.S. review process. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Georgy A. Arbatov, one of the Soviet Union's most prominent 
expert on American affairs, said that Bush's arms control proposals, and his 
call for agreement to be reached within six months to a year, could be achieved 
if the U.S. negotiators speeded up their tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"A new way of negotiating would be to set a goal and work very quickly to get 
it," Arbatov said. "The Soviet Union would be ready for this new way of 
negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
Another Soviet expert at the briefing, Nikolai Portugalov, said the Gorbachev 
visit to Bonn should be a "great ice melter." 
</P>
<P>
West German officials said the major point of the meeting will be a joint 
declaration of cooperation and the signing of a dozen bilateral accords in the 
cultural, economic, and scientific fields. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, Shevardnadze appeared to be selling Gorbachev's ideas about 
perestroika, the Soviet reform program, to an East German government reluctant 
to accept the new concepts coming out of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika has been becoming a fashionable conversation piece in the West," 
Shevardnadze told Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer. "Now and again some incorrect 
comparisons of one socialist country against another can be heard. We stick to 
the principle whereby every fraternal country can arrange socialism in its own 
national colors." 
</P>
<P>
Fischer replied that East Germany remained a close ally of Moscow and did not 
need any lessons in this regard from the West. 
</P>
<P>
Although East Germany is Moscow's leading trade partner, it has resisted the 
economic reforms pushed by Gorbachev, which are beginning to take hold in 
varying degrees in East European countries such as Hungary and Poland.

KHOMEINI SUCCESSOR HAILED IN IRAN; 
</P>
<P>
KHAMENEI PRAISED BY SPEAKER RAFSANJANI AT TEHRAN RITE

Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday turned a memorial 
service for the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini into a mass rally for Khomeini's 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker has moved this week to bolster the reputation of President Ali 
Khamenei, who was picked to succeed Khomeini as supreme political and religious 
leader. Rafsanjani and Khamenei are considered moderates. 
</P>
<P>
During his sermon at the Friday prayer service at Tehran University, Rafsanjani 
said Khamenei meets the conditions Khomeini outlined for his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Obeying Khamenei is obeying Khomeini," chanted the crowd of hundreds of 
thousands who packed the campus and surrounding streets for miles. Families 
knelt on prayer mats in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Khamenei, only a middle-ranking cleric, was initially viewed 
as temporary. However, Rafsanjani said Thursday that it is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's memorial, Rafsanjani and other leaders sat cross-legged on 
carpets next to the rostrum, which held a color portrait of Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
While he spoke, Rafsanjani clutched the barrel of an AK-47 assault rifle, as he 
usually does at the Friday prayer service. The gun symbolizes the determination 
of Iran to fight its enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said that Khomeini, although he did not specifically name a 
successor, had hinted that Khamenei is qualified. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Khomeini, who died of a heart attack Saturday at age 86, wrote 
that his successor need not be a marja, or supreme religious leader, even 
though the constitution says so. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini had given permission many times for officials to overlook the 
constitution, Rafsanjani said, adding, "We all accept that leadership is above 
the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, 49, was selected to succeed Khomeini on Sunday by the Assembly of 
Experts. Khomeini had formed the 83-member group to handle his succession. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian press reports have started calling Khamenei an ayatollah, a title 
reserved for the highest religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of Khamenei's rising fortunes, the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency announced that Iran's military commanders met with him Thursday to 
declare their allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Rafsanjani signaled his own intention of playing a bigger 
political role, telling foreign reporters he wants more executive power for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, 55, is the only declared candidate in the Aug. 18 presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's second term as president expires in October, and the constitution 
bars him from running again. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian moderates such as Rafsanjani seek to end the country's international 
isolation and boost private enterprise. Radicals hard-liners favor a 
self-reliant, fundamentalist Iran.

100 INJURED AS 5,000 STORM TOWN IN SOVIET UZBEKISTAN

A mob of up to 5,000 people armed with automatic rifles and other weapons 
stormed the center of the town of Kokand in Uzbekistan, and 100 people suffered 
gunshot wounds, the head of the Soviet Interior Ministry's troops said. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Yuri V. Shatalin said the attack came on the sixth straight day of 
violence in the Fergana region of the Central Asian Soviet republic. The 
violence began last weekend with clashes between Uzbeks and the local 
Meskhetian minority, rival Muslim sects. 
</P>
<P>
"They attacked state organizations and also places where the Meskhetians 
lived," said Shatalin, who was speaking on Soviet television. "We saw large 
amounts of automatic rifles, pistols and other firearms in the hands of the 
attackers." 
</P>
<P>
A television correspondent who visited Kokand said troops responded merely by 
firing in the air, indicating that the injuries were caused by one group, 
apparently Uzbeks, firing at the Meskhetians. 
</P>
<P>
The correspondent said that helicopters and doctors had been sent to Kokand, 
about 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, and planes were standing by to evacuate 
the Meskhetians, a minority deported to the area from the Soviet republic of 
Georgia by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper Izvestia, published Friday morning before the latest 
clashes, said a total of 80 people were killed in this week's ethnic violence 
in Uzbekistan and 800 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Six people were reported killed and 90 wounded Wednesday in Kokand, 60 miles to 
the west of the city of Fergana, where the violence started. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed film of a charging crowd and burned out cars and buildings. 
The correspondent said there were not enough police to stop and arrest the 
crowds of "criminals and jobless." 
</P>
<P>
He said a local Communist Party leader, identified only as Goncharov, told him 
he had been "unable to find a common language with the crowd," who had "moved 
on him with sticks and stones" when he tried to address them. 
</P>
<P>
The correspondent said he had only been able to speak to Goncharov by 
telephone. A group of Soviet journalists who tried to reach the city center 
were prevented from getting through by the scale of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Shatalin said a detachment of airborne troops had also been sent to the 
Uzbeksky district, also in the Fergana region, after a group of about 500 young 
people tried to seize the local police station. 
</P>
<P>
The clashes, the worst reported case of inter-ethnic violence in decades of 
Soviet history, appear to have been triggered by a mixture of ethnic and 
religious differences and by high unemployment.

<P>
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, an ultra-right-wing ideologue who was one of 
President Alfredo Cristiani's closest advisers, was assassinated here Friday 
nine days after taking office as presidential chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Rodriguez Porth, whose formal title was minister of the 
presidency, was shot to death at 8:10 a.m. (7:10 PDT) just as he was entering a 
station wagon parked in front of his house in the La Mascota district of the 
city. His driver, Juan Gilberto Clara Carranza, and his groundskeeper, Benjamin 
Perez, also died. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran government, the military and U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker 
all blamed the deaths on the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a 
Marxist guerrilla movement that has fought a nine-year civil war here. They 
charged that the rebels are trying to provoke a violent right-wing reaction 
that would endanger the massive U.S. aid program for El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widow's Suggestion 
</P>
<P>
However, a guerrilla spokesman in Mexico City told the British news agency 
Reuters that "it is almost impossible" that the FMLN, as the rebels are called, 
carried out the murders. And Rodriguez Porth's widow suggested the killers 
could have been "terrorists from the right." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Porth, a founder and one-time director general of Cristiani's ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena party), was the second senior member of 
the party to be assassinated in the last two months. Atty. Gen. Roberto Garcia 
Alvarado died April 19 when his car was bombed. In addition, an unsuccessful 
attempt was made April 14 on the life of Vice President Jose Francisco Merino. 
</P>
<P>
Although they deny responsibility for these attacks, the rebels have pledged to 
make El Salvador "ungovernable" under Cristiani's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference at the end of the day, Cristiani said the killing of 
Rodriquez Porth demonstrates that the "dark forces" of the FMLN "don't want 
peace, nor reconciliation, nor agreement nor progress for the country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Punishment Vowed 
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions about a possible violent government or Arena reaction, 
the president stressed that "we are going to respond under the law . . . and 
punish those responsible for this crime . . . but we will not be provoked into 
sinking the country into a whirlpool of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Porth was a natural target for the rebels. Over the years, first as a 
lawyer and a member of the country's wealthy business establishment, then as a 
law professor, diplomat and official of Arena, he was a bitter critic of any 
opponent of right-wing policies. He consistently advocated hard-line action 
against the National University for supposedly harboring FMLN supporters. 
</P>
<P>
A close friend who held similar opinions, Francisco L. Peccorini, was shot to 
death March 15. The FMLN acknowledged killing Peccorini, a dual 
American-Salvadoran citizen who had retired from teaching philosophy at Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Porth, who served as foreign minister during a right-wing military 
dictatorship in the late 1970s, probably was best known to the public for his 
almost daily denunciations of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whom he 
called a Communist dupe. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, although he had been an unrelenting advocate of hard-handed suppression of 
the FMLN, Rodriguez Porth last week called for talks with the guerrillas to end 
the civil war. It was this that led his widow to say Friday that he could have 
been murdered by the right. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's killings clearly were well planned. As the official walked the 20 feet 
from his front door of his house at 240 La Mascota St. to the Jeep Cherokee 
parked at the curb, the killer sat on a motorcycle about 50 yards away. He 
evidently knew that Rodriguez Porth never used bodyguards and left for work at 
the same time nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Rodriguez Porth clambered into the back seat of the car and the two 
other men were walking to the front doors, the motorcycle drove up and stopped. 
Watched by a jogger only 90 feet away and two housekeepers from a home across 
the street, the killer calmly but quickly walked to the curb-side and fired 
three shots into Rodriguez Porth's upper right chest. 
</P>
<P>
He turned and shot Perez once and Carranza twice and then climbed onto his 
idling motorcycle and drove away as Perez's wife and small child came to the 
door. The roar of the departing motorcycle did not drown out the sound of the 
child crying "Papita, papita." 
</P>
<P>
The attack was over in less than two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to reporters, Ambassador Walker said that the killing was 
"an act of mindless terror . . . that fits the pattern of other recent 
terrorist attacks and killings." 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, is to "do something so atrocious, so provocative, so repugnant 
that the government, or others, must retaliate." The "others" Walker mentioned 
are the right-wing death squads that killed thousands of FMLN supporters and 
other anti-government critics in the early 1980s. Many Arena leaders are widely 
suspected of involvement in the death squads, which were responsible for 17 
killings during the first four months of this year, according to the human 
rights office of the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the guerrillas proposed last month to call off attacks on government 
and Arena leaders if Roberto D'Aubuisson, another founder of the party and one 
whose name is most often linked with the death squads, were tried for the 1980 
assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. The offer was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying that President Bush 
"strongly condemns the vicious murder" and "again calls on extremist groups to 
put an end to the violence in El Salvador, noting that only through the 
renunciation of terrorism and war, and the acceptance of democracy, will there 
be peace." 
</P>
<P>
"The president noted a pattern of violence against government officials in El 
Salvador by those who seek to destroy the democratic gains made in that 
country," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walker said he expects the government to pursue the killer "within the 
legal system," powerful Arena leaders were speaking of revenge within an hour 
of Rodriguez Porth's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing outright terrorism," said Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a former army 
colonel who once led a military mutiny against Duarte's government. "They are 
troglodytes, and the only way to make them understand is to fight fire with 
fire."

Rebels attacked the country's most important hydroelectric plant with mortar 
fire, blacking out the northern provincial capital of Jinotega and surrounding 
towns for several hours, government radio said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Central America plant, north of Jinotega, was damaged in the Thursday night 
attack, and an undetermined number of people were wounded, a Voice of Nicaragua 
broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Jinotega, 100 miles north of Managua, said that the Contras also 
blew up electrical poles along the road between the city and the plant. A 
spokesman for the Nicaraguan Energy Institute said power was restored to the 
area at mid-morning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista government signed a temporary 
cease-fire in March, 1988, but efforts to extend the accord into a permanent 
truce have not borne fruit. The government has extended the cease-fire 
unilaterally on a monthly basis, but sporadic attacks have continued. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel responsibility was denied by Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros in a 
telephone interview.

CHINESE APPREHENSIVE AS THEY HEAD FOR HOME

The Chinese student sat nervously clutching a fluffy white stuffed animal in a 
boarding area at the San Francisco International Airport. Outside, on the 
tarmac, sat an Air China 747, ready for departure to Shanghai and then to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The student, who asked not to be named, was eager to see his wife and child for 
the first time in nearly a year. In the name of love, he was returning to a 
country that now gave him serious doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what is going on," he said as he pondered for a moment the 
possibility of not boarding the plane. "Some people back home say everything is 
safe, but I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
While thousands of students, tourists and bureaucrats are pouring out of China 
to escape the upheaval there, a much smaller number of Chinese are making the 
opposite trip back home. 
</P>
<P>
For some, like the business people who came for a few weeks to buy and sell in 
America, the decision is easy. This is simply the last leg of their trip, and 
they will be home soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work is finished, and now we have to go back," said one business 
executive, wearing a Mack Truck souvenir cap. "There is nothing else to say." 
</P>
<P>
But for some students and teachers who prepared to board the flight Friday -- a 
departure date chosen months ago to coincide with the end of their school 
programs -- the decision to go back home was made much more difficult by the 
violent events of the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Some have taken active roles in the United States to support the student 
demonstrators in China, and they are now worried they may suffer the 
consequences at home. 
</P>
<P>
Others are simply anxious because they don't know what is happening back home 
and are afraid they are flying into an unpredictable maelstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we don't know what is going to happen in China," said one 
student preparing to board the flight to Shanghai. "But my wife is still there. 
We are torn between two worlds." 
</P>
<P>
There were about 140 passengers making the trip on Air China Flight 984, 
filling about half the plane. With the exception of three journalists from a 
Brazilian television network, all the passengers were Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
In the boarding area, smoke swirled in the air as passengers puffed on 
cigarettes and gazedoutside the large window at the jets and runways. 
</P>
<P>
The duty-free shop nearby was mobbed earlier as passengers bought their last 
American candy and cigarettes to take home. 
</P>
<P>
Xu Qingyao, 46, a teacher from Sichuan province who had been studying for the 
last nine months at Goshen College in Indiana, was one of several who were 
anxious to be on his way to China. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm longing for home and my family," he said. "I am ready to go to work for 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
Xu said he watched television reports on the killings in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square but does not believe everything he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everything is fine," he said. "I don't think the situation is the same 
as what the foreign media has shown." 
</P>
<P>
One elderly couple waiting in the boarding area said they believe this is a 
good time to go home. 
</P>
<P>
They said they had been in America for the last six months, visiting their son, 
who is a student in Pittsburgh. The day before the flight, they called their 
family in Beijing and were told the conflict in the Chinese capital was 
beginning to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
They had the option of delaying their flight for a few more weeks or even 
months. But the man said: "What difference would it make? Who knows if things 
would get better or worse?" 
</P>
<P>
His wife added: "Our home is in Beijing. Our whole family is there. We have to 
go back sometime." 
</P>
<P>
One student, who would only give his last name, Li, said no matter what the 
situation in China, he had already bought his ticket and was committed to 
returning on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visiting His Girlfriend 
</P>
<P>
He was traveling to Shanghai to see his girlfriend, who had been apart from him 
for three years. He said he hopes to marry her upon his return to China. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what is happening, I am going home," Li said. "I feel I will be 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
But even those who said they felt safe conceded that the situation in China 
could change rapidly. In the boarding area, a vague paranoia filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't use my name," said one man. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't say anything about my parents' situation in China," said another. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't want to say anything," said one business woman. 
</P>
<P>
Just after 4 p.m., a voice transmitted over the loudspeaker announced that 
Flight 984 would soon be boarding. A mass of blue and gray suits rose. The 
passengers began toting their carry-on luggage toward the boarding gate. 
</P>
<P>
The student who had been considering delaying his return to China rose and 
began collecting the things around him. In about 14 more hours, he would again 
be back in his homeland, where he taught in Sichuan province before taking 
nearly a year off as an exchange student at Goshen College. 
</P>
<P>
He bundled up the white stuffed animal for his child and lined up at the 
boarding gate, with everyone else.

The Kremlin's main spokesman said Friday that the Moscow was surprised by 
China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators and that Soviet officials have 
been unable to reach Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get through, either," Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Soviet officials were surprised at the means with which Chinese 
Communist leaders suppressed student protesters who had been rallying 
peacefully for weeks in support of broader reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was surprised by the brutality of the crackdown on the protests, 
Gerasimov said: "We hadn't expected this." He added that Moscow was "extremely 
dismayed" at Beijing's actions. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's comments are the first official Soviet response since the new 
Soviet congress issued an extremely guarded statement Tuesday saying events in 
China were "an internal affair."

THATCHER AIDE TO ASSESS HONG KONG WOES, NEW BRITISH SETTLERS

British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe will visit Hong Kong in early July to 
assess problems confronting the British colony after the bloody military 
crackdown in Beijing, the Foreign Office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The exact dates and duration of the trip are being worked out, the office said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as debate raged over exploring ways of allowing larger 
numbers of Hong Kong citizens holding British passports to settle in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Events in China have prompted widespread fears among people in Hong Kong, which 
Britain is due to hand over to Chinese rule in 1997. Under a 1984 agreement, 
China promised to allow capitalism in Hong Kong to exist for 50 years, but 
critics claim it could override the treaty obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Calls are mounting for Britain to open its doors to the colony's 3.2 million 
Chinese who hold British passports and to renegotiate or even scrap the 1984 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But letting in more immigrants is politically unpopular in Britain. And 
renegotiating the agreement appears diplomatically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Balking at easing the law for Hong Kong, Howe warned the House of Commons 
against "a massive new immigration commitment which could more than double the 
ethnic minority population of the United Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
In defending his postion, Howe has resorted to saying that China's aging, 
hard-line Communists may be gone by 1997, that China's economy will always need 
Hong Kong's capitalism and Britain has no option but to hand over the colony. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has ruled out any "open door" policy. She 
earlier told Parliament that the government is prepared "to see if we can get 
increasing flexibility . . . to allow an increasing number of people in here." 
This flexibility could include allowing discretion over letting in public 
servants and people with private incomes, she indicated. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview Friday in Hong Kong, the leader of Britain's centrist 
Liberal and Social Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, said his country should allow all 
Hong Kong residents who want to resettle to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't say it is immediately practical," he added. "But I do believe that 
Britain has a moral responsibility to take the lead in this issue." 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Ashdown, local legislators issued a statement saying, "We 
reiterate our position that Britain has a fundamental moral duty to extend the 
right to abode to all the British nationals in Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong on Friday, protesters again demonstrated against suppression of 
the student protests in China. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of fishing boats flying black flags circled Hong Kong harbor for 
nearly an hour in a protest that fouled up traffic in one of the world's 
busiest ports. With sirens blaring, the boats steamed around the harbor at full 
speed, trapping tourists on cruises and halting barges waiting to unload.

OSHA ORDERED TO REVIEW FORMALDEHYDE CANCER RISK

<P>
A federal appeals court Friday ordered the Labor Department to reconsider the 
cancer risk from exposure to formaldehyde and its decision not to guarantee 
full wages to workers disabled by the gas. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington said the department's Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration "has failed adequately to explain" its finding 
that the risk of getting cancer from exposure to formaldehyde was not 
significant if employers complied with OSHA's exposure limits. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel also concluded that OSHA offered a "feeble" explanation 
of its decision not to include in its standard for formaldehyde exposure 
provisions guaranteeing that workers will be paid full wages and retain 
seniority rights during rehabilitation from any illness linked to the 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Exams Not Required 
</P>
<P>
The court, ruling in a suit filed by three unions, upheld OSHA's decision not 
to require employers to provide annual medical examinations to workers exposed 
to formaldehyde, a colorless gas that, when mixed with other materials, has a 
number of applications in industry and is found in many construction and 
consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
Also upheld was the OSHA-set exposure "action level" at which employers are 
required to provide workers with training, protective clothing and other 
protective measures. The unions failed to show that lowering that level would 
significantly enhance worker safety, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
An OSHA spokesman said agency officials had not reviewed the decision and had 
no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA, revising a 1972 standard, in 1987 set a maximum permissible exposure 
level of 1 part per million of formaldehyde during an eight-hour workday and 
set the action level at 0.5 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers and the 
International Molders and Allied Workers unions challenged the standard, saying 
OSHA should have set a far more stringent exposure limit. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in remanding to the Labor Department the question of cancer risk, 
questioned the formula used by the department to extrapolate the cancer risk to 
humans from the risk found in animal studies.

In a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, an Egyptian-born rocket scientist 
pleaded guilty Friday to attempting to smuggle out highly sophisticated missile 
components to the military of his native country. 
</P>
<P>
As Abdelkader Helmy switched his plea to guilty to a single charge in a 
multicount indictment, U.S. District Judge Raul A. Ramirez noted that Helmy may 
be required to testify against unspecified officials of the Egyptian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
During questioning of Helmy, the jurist told him, without elaboration, "You 
could be called on to testify against agents and high-ranking authorities of 
the Egyptian government." Helmy said he understood this. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for dropping all but the one charge to which he pleaded guilty, 
Helmy, a former rocket propulsion scientist employed by Aerojet Solid 
Propulsion Co. near Sacramento, agreed to "fully cooperate" with federal agents 
investigating other defendants, including two Egyptian nationals. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly built, bearded and balding scientist stood stiffly at attention 
during the hourlong session and answered the judge's questions in a soft, 
heavily accented voice. At one point, he said that if the plea agreement were 
to turn sour on him, he would have no option but "to trust my God." 
</P>
<P>
Helmy, 41, a naturalized American citizen, pleaded guilty to attempting to 
export without a license from the State Department about 430 pounds of a carbon 
phenolic fabric, a high-tech material used for ballistic missile nose cones, 
rocket nozzles and radar-evading aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence for the offense is 10 years in prison and a $1-million 
fine. Under the plea agreement, which is subject to approval by Ramirez, U.S. 
Atty. David F. Levy recommended that Helmy be sentenced to serve almost five 
years in prison and be fined up to $358,690. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities have identified Helmy as the key American figure in an 
alleged illegal operation to smuggle missile system components and technical 
data out of the United States to Egypt, an American ally in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Helmy, who lives in the Sacramento suburb of El Dorado Hills, allegedly was 
sent $1 million from a Swiss bank account between December, 1982, and March, 
1988. Customs agents subsequently seized $810,000 from his bank accounts, which 
officials said would be forfeited to the federal government under the plea 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in what the government contends was an elaborate illegal export 
and money-laundering scheme are James Huffman, 47, of Lexington, Ohio, a 
defense aerospace company marketing representative; Hussam Yusef, an Egyptian 
colonel and diplomat based in Austria, and Faud Algamal, who entered the United 
States as an Egyptian diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities said Helmy had been under close surveillance before the 
seizure at Baltimore-Washington airport last June 24 of a shipment of the 
carbon fabric as it was about to be loaded aboard an Egyptian military C-130 
cargo plane. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also charged that in March, 1988, the defendants actually 
smuggled out of the country the fabric and two technical manuals that dealt 
with the use of carbon materials. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, free on $250,000 bond, is scheduled to be tried Aug. 8. Levy noted 
that efforts have been under way to extradite Yusef and Algamal, who are 
believed to be in Egypt. However, besides being difficult to pursue, both could 
invoke diplomatic immunity from prosecution in the United States.

FEINSTEIN CITES ETHICS AS KEY THEME IN CAMPAIGN

Enumerating the ethical misfortunes of some of her fellow Democrats, former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein chose Friday to make clean government a 
central theme of her campaign to become the Democratic nominee for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, the only potential gubernatorial candidate who is not mow holding 
office, criticized both federal and state officeholders for having created a 
"cloud of suspicion" over government in their zeal to collect honorariums, 
campaign contributions and free trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly there is a public perception, a perception whether it's right or 
not right, that elected officials trade their integrity for honorariums and 
that some -- and I say some -- would abandon their principles for profits," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting heavily from newspaper accounts of political misdeeds, Feinstein 
unveiled her new campaign platform at a meeting of the California Society of 
Newspaper Editors. The editors, who had originally planned to hear her address 
during a luncheon meeting at Sacramento's Hyatt Hotel, at the last minute had 
to trek across the street to a legislative hearing room because she refused to 
cross a union picket line. The Hotel, Restaurant Workers Local 49, AFL-CIO, has 
been picketing the downtown hotel for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein is the second politician this week to announce that ethical reform 
would be a major campaign theme. Former Republican Rep. Daniel E. Lungren 
promised Wednesday that he would actively prosecute political corruption if his 
efforts to win election as attorney general are successful. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein vowed to push for legislation that would drastically reduce the 
amount of money candidates and officeholders can collect from political action 
committees and other special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
But when asked if she would voluntarily agree to put some of the reforms into 
effect in her own campaign, Feinstein said she would not do so unless other 
candidates agreed to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make a lot of sense for a candidate to disadvantage himself," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that similar proposals have stalled in the Legislature, Feinstein 
outlined a legislative reform package that included proposals for banning 
political donations from businesses, limiting political action committee 
contributions to $1,000, preventing officeholders from collecting contributions 
in non-election years, banning honorariums and limiting the acceptance of gifts 
-- including travel -- to $100. 
</P>
<P>
She also called for legislation that would prohibit lawmakers from voting on 
any matter in which they have a direct financial interest, prevent state 
administrators from lobbying their former agencies for at least one year after 
they leave office and ban lobbying of governmental agencies by elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor said she will try to find a lawmaker to sponsor her proposals 
and if that is unsuccessful, she will work to get them adopted in an 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said her travels throughout the state have shown her that recent 
publicity over the resignations of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas), U.S. 
Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) and the federal indictment of State Sen. Joseph 
Montoya (D-Whittier) have given voters "a profound mistrust of government." 
</P>
<P>
"As California faces a crisis of leadership, a cloud of suspicion hangs over 
our government," she said. "And this cloud adds to the inability of our elected 
officials to get anything accomplished."

SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARNED AGAINST TAKING PUBLISHER 'INDUCEMENTS'

<P>
A new "professional code of conduct" aimed at preventing abuses in the textbook 
selection and purchasing process was adopted Friday by the State Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The new ethical guidelines come in the wake of disclosures that some publishers 
have bought expensive meals and have paid for weekend "seminars" at fancy 
resorts for local educators who select textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have widespread abuses? No. Are there some cases of abuse? Yes," State 
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said during discussion of the proposed 
code. "I think this will help." 
</P>
<P>
The code reminds school districts that it is a violation of state law for those 
who evaluate and purchase textbooks to accept money, meals, gifts or other 
"inducements" that might influence their decisions. The law also prohibits 
publishers from making such offers to educators. 
</P>
<P>
The code also asks each of California's 1,013 school districts to adopt 
conflict-of-interest disclosure statements so that teachers and school 
officials who write textbooks or consult for publishing companies do not also 
participate in local selection decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts now require such disclosure but others do not. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Chernow, chairman of the state Curriculum Commission, said the new 
guidelines "will raise the consciousness" of both publishers and school 
officials about ethical issues that are involved in the selection and purchase 
of instructional materials. 
</P>
<P>
Chernow said some recent disclosures of the "wining and dining" of textbook 
evaluators were a "smoke screen" for publishers "who haven't been providing 
quality materials." 
</P>
<P>
But he also said that "it's become evident that some publishers' 
representatives and some (school) district representatives have been violating 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Marion McDowell questioned the need for the conduct code. 
</P>
<P>
"The board already has a code of conduct for professional people . . . and we 
already have the state law," McDowell said. "I don't quite understand why we 
have to have another code." 
</P>
<P>
But McDowell joined in a unanimous board vote to approve the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the board approved a "model school accountability report 
card" that will provide the parents and students at every California public 
school with important information on such subjects as test scores, dropout 
rates, class size and expenditures per pupil. 
</P>
<P>
Every school in the state must adopt either this model or some other version of 
a school "report card" for the next school year.

PIPELINE THAT TOUCHED OFF FATAL FIRE REACTIVATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The gasoline pipeline that ruptured and set off a deadly fire in a San 
Bernardino neighborhood May 25 was reactivated Friday after the federal Office 
of Pipeline Safety gave its approval and the latest moves in federal court to 
block recharging of the line failed. 
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on the site of the explosion that killed two residents and 
injured 31 while demolishing or damaging 15 homes, officials of the Calnev Pipe 
Line Co. said that shortly before 3:30 p.m., company technicians flicked a 
switch in Colton, where the pipeline originates, sending 2,500 barrels of 
gasoline an hour coursing to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino Mayor W. R. (Bob) Holcomb, who was present at the briefing, said 
he was reconciled to the reopening of the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the company has taken every step that is humanly possible to make 
sure this line, as presently installed, is safe and can be operated safely," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayor added, and Calnev officials confirmed, that the company and city 
have agreed that the company will eventually relocate the pipeline away from 
homes to the other side of Southern Pacific railroad tracks, if a proposed 
federal study indicates that would be in order. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen days before the May 25 pipeline rupture, a runaway Southern Pacific 
train jumped the tracks and struck several homes in the same area, killing four 
people and injuring 11. The National Transportation Safety Board is 
investigating the likely possibility that the two incidents are related. 
Federal inspectors found several large dents in the pipeline after it ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the pipeline was restarted Friday, District Judge Lawrence 
Lydick, ruling that he did not have jurisdiction in the matter, rejected the 
latest motion by an attorney for homeowners in the affected area to block the 
reopening of the line. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, James H. Davis, said he would appeal Lydick's order to the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Numerous attempts in both state and federal 
courts in the last two weeks to supersede federal regulators and order an 
immediate relocation of the pipeline have been turned down on the grounds 
Lydick stated. 
</P>
<P>
Before ruling, Lydick told the aggrieved San Bernardino residents in his 
courtroom in Santa Ana that he could not "help but feel a great deal of 
sympathy and concern" for them. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I don't think your problems are helped very much by the 
special-interest groups and others who seem to think their best interest is to 
keep you excited." 
</P>
<P>
To this, one of the residents, Paul Evans, responded in an interview: "My 
feeling is, we don't have special-interrest groups. We're acting on our own 
behalf. . . . We want to see the pipeline moved or us relocated." 
</P>
<P>
In his order, the judge also turned down the residents' bid for a court order 
to force Calnev to continue paying their hotel and food bills. Although the 
city has told residents of homes still standing that they are free to return to 
the neighborhood, some, pleading safety, have refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, Richard Beam, director of the Office of Pipeline 
Safety, said he gave his approval for restarting the gasoline flow because he 
had determined that Calnev had "complied with the terms of our orders and all 
of the applicable federal regulations tied into the construction" of 1,000 feet 
of replacement pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
However, asked if he would be willing to give a federal guarantee of the 
neighborhood's safety, Beam, responded tersely, "No." 
</P>
<P>
Calnev officials have said the new 14-inch line is stronger, buried deeper and 
better-protected than the old one. 
</P>
<P>
"What took place here May 25 has greatly grieved all of us at Calnev," said 
Anthony Andrukaitis, vice president of GATX Terminals Corp., which owns Calnev, 
on Friday. "It will be in our hearts and minds forever as we make every 
decision (on operating the new line)." 
</P>
<P>
Andrukaitis said it will take three or four days for the gasoline that flowed 
through the new section of the line to reach Las Vegas, which relies on the 
line for most of its fuel supply. During the two weeks the line was out, the 
Nevada city was supplied mainly by fuel trucks at a somewhat higher price.

FEW WORRY AS WHOLESALE PRICES SPURT 0.9% 
</P>

<P>
Wholesale prices jumped 0.9% in May, considerably more than expected, as the 
cost of gasoline, food and autos increased, the Labor Department reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The increase brought wholesale price inflation for the first five months of 
1989 up to an annual rate of 9.4%. However, the financial markets and analysts 
took the news calmly; economists attributed most of the rise to factors whose 
main impact has already passed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not at all what it appears to be," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief 
economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "It's an aberration. What you 
have here is a continued effect of last year's drought and the oil price run-up 
earlier this year." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they expect wholesale price increases to subside for the rest of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We should see annual rates of producer price inflation running more slowly, at 
an annual rate of about 3.5% to 5%," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the 
Boston Co. Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
May's price jump featured increases of 1.8% for passenger cars; 3.3% jump for 
energy goods and 0.8% for food, with fresh vegetables accounting for most of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy Inflation Peak 
</P>
<P>
Faced with signs of a slowing economy, the Federal Reserve this week let 
markets push interest rates down about half a percentage point. After Friday's 
report, little further easing seems likely for fear it would fuel inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts said energy inflation seems to have peaked for the year 
and that new consumer rebates by car makers should blunt further auto price 
increases. Some speculated that many other price increases at the wholesale 
level may not be passed along to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers continue to be price-conscious, and businesses continue to be 
cost-conscious in a very competitive environment," said Dirk Van Dongen, 
president of the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. 
</P>
<P>
"So long as we have that kind of behavior in the economy," he said, "we don't 
have any sign of inflationary psychology driving behavior. Consumers don't rush 
to buy for fear prices will be higher tomorrow. And our people are buying 
sharply, negotiating aggressively, because they realize they can't pass these 
things on, willy-nilly." 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that inflation for intermediate goods excluding 
food and energy was only 0.2%, while prices for crude goods other than food and 
energy actually dropped 0.4%. Thus, prices for finished goods of many types are 
not expected to accelerate much. 
</P>
<P>
"Vegetable prices were unexpectedly high, but we expect agricultural prices to 
level and possibly even decline later in the year," said Stacy Kottman, an 
analyst at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "There was a rebound in the 
measured prices of autos from April rebates and incentives, but we don't expect 
a lot of that to get into (consumer prices) because the auto market is quite 
soft and the industry is in no position to make those prices stick on the 
consumer level." 
</P>
<P>
Kottman noted that the 3.3% jump in energy prices actually marked a slowdown 
from a 7.2% increase recorded in April. "We think producer prices for energy 
have finally ratcheted up to where they are compatible with the $20-a-barrel 
crude oil we have had all winter, so we don't look for much higher prices 
there," he said. "All that suggests that the producer prices ought to be fairly 
well behaved by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Sinai said the high wholesale inflation for the beginning of 1989 will "lock us 
into producer price inflation of about 6.5% for this year." 
</P>
<P>
"So the message is that price inflation is still entrenched and will respond 
only very slowly to a slackening economy. From the point of view of the Fed, 
this is too high for them to ease any more." 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the Labor Department's producer price index rose 
1.2 points to 114.2 in May, from a base of 100 in 1982, meaning that a selected 
cross-section of wholesale finished goods costing $100 in 1982 would now cost 
$114.20.

SINGER CHAIRMAN GUILTY OF TAX, SECURITIES FRAUD; FIRST VERDICT IN SCANDAL 
</P>

<P>
Paul A. Bilzerian, who rose from humble origins to become a corporate raider 
and chairman of Singer Co., was convicted Friday on nine counts of securities 
fraud and tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which charged that Bilzerian's takeover attempts relied in part on 
fraud, gave federal prosecutors their first guilty verdict in the chain of big 
Wall Street securities fraud and insider trading cases sparked by information 
from former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky. The others have resulted in guilty 
pleas or mistrials or are pending. 
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed the prosecution's faith in its star witness in the case, 
Boyd L. Jefferies. The former head of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies 
&amp; Co., Jefferies is also the main government witness in several other 
pending cases. His credibility as a witness was in doubt after the first case 
in which he testified, involving GAF Corp., resulted in two mistrials. 
</P>
<P>
Paul O'Neill, 26, an audit manager at a major accounting firm, was jury foreman 
in the Bilzerian case and said after the trial that there was little 
disagreement among the jurors. He said they were persuaded mainly by the 
testimony of Jefferies and a Jefferies &amp; Co. executive, Michael Landy. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of credence in Boyd Jefferies' testimony," O'Neill told 
reporters. He said the jury found Bilzerian's own credibility as a witness "not 
that high." 
</P>
<P>
The jury returned the verdict after deliberating for eight hours over two days. 
Bilzerian, 38, showed no emotion as the foreman replied "guilty" on each of the 
nine counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and 
giving false statements to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian originally was indicted on 12 counts, but one was dropped and two 
others were merged with other charges shortly before the case went to the jury. 
He faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison and a fine of $2.25 million. 
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward allowed to him to remain free on a $250,000 
bond until sentencing Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian was accused of amassing millions illegally in failed raids in 1985 
and 1986 on Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.; H. H. Roberts &amp; Co., and Hammermill 
Paper Co., as well as in an undisclosed investment in Armco Inc. The government 
claimed that Bilzerian secretly accumulated shares in the companies, 
circumvented Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements and 
misrepresented how he got the funds for the takeover attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that the scheme involved an illegal arrangement with 
Jefferies &amp; Co. under which the brokerage agreed to hold blocks of stock 
for Bilzerian and hide their true ownership. The government also claimed that 
the scheme enabled Bilzerian to create phony tax losses. 
</P>
<P>
The charges did not relate to Bilzerian's involvement with Singer Co. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mathews, one of Bilzerian's defense lawyers, said he didn't believe that 
Bilzerian had received a fair trial and said he would appeal the verdict on the 
grounds of improper rulings by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Bilzerian appeared to play dumb at times on the witness 
stand, portraying himself as a naive newcomer to the world of SEC regulations, 
tax laws and the financing of big deals. He described himself as a high school 
dropout who had to work to support himself from an early age. But he managed to 
obtain a degree from Harvard Business School after time in Vietnam, and he 
turned his attention to stocks after a stint in the real estate development 
business with his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the would-be corporate raider was not taken seriously when, in the 
mid-1980s, he launched a succession of unsuccessful takeover attempts with only 
modest apparent resources. Although he earned some big profits and had the 
backing of such well-known investors as shopping center magnate Edward J. 
DeBartolo Sr., all of his early attempts failed. The investment world was 
somewhat surprised when, in 1987, Bilzerian succeeded in a $1.06-billion 
hostile bid to take over Singer Co., a major defense contractor and one of the 
nation's oldest and best-known companies. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling during the trial by Judge Ward caught defense lawyers by surprise and 
undermined a main element of the defense: Bilzerian's claim that he had acted 
in good faith and had not intentionally violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that if Bilzerian testified that he thought he was within the 
law when he filed erroneous documents with the SEC, prosecutors would be 
allowed to question him about the legal advice he had received from his 
attorneys. The ruling also raised the possibility that prosecutors would be 
able to call Bilzerian's own lawyers as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers claimed the ruling violated the confidentiality normally given 
to clients' consultations with their attorneys. It prompted the defense to 
abandon plans to question Bilzerian on the stand about whether he believed what 
he was doing was legal. After the trial, Mathews said in an interview that the 
judge's ruling on that issue may have cost Bilzerian the case. "It was nuclear. 
It was devastating to us," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Happy With Jefferies 
</P>
<P>
The government presented several key pieces of evidence in the trial, including 
tape recordings of telephone conversations that Bilzerian had with DeBartolo, 
who appeared to agree to give secret financial backing to the Cluett Peabody 
bid. Prosecutors also presented evidence that Bilzerian had lied in earlier 
testimony in SEC proceedings. Under cross-examination from Assistant U.S. Atty. 
David Brodsky, Bilzerian admitted that he had false invoices drawn up to cover 
payments to and from from Jefferies &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Benito Romano, the acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said he was 
particularly heartened by Jefferies' successful performance as a witness. 
"We're obviously happy that Boyd Jefferies' testimony was credited by the 
jury," he said. Jefferies is slated to be the main witness in the stock market 
manipulation trial of Salim B. Lewis, a securities trader and merger 
specialist, and in another retrial of the GAF case. Jefferies, implicated by 
Boesky in illegal stock transactions, agreed in 1987 to plead guilty to two 
charges and cooperate with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Romano said that although each case will stand or fall on its own merits, the 
Bilzerian trial indicated that a jury is capable of sorting through very 
complicated securities fraud allegations. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what the implications of Bilzerian's conviction 
will be for Singer Co., which is no longer a publicly held firm. The company 
faces civil charges from the Justice Department that it overcharged the 
Pentagon from 1980 to 1988 on contracts for aircraft flight simulators.

BAD TIMING FOR TRADE SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
THE TURMOIL IN BEIJING LEFT AMERICAN BUYERS WARY OF DEALS WITH CHINA FIRMS.

<P>
Liu Hanchi, the director of the Tianjin Fountain Pen Factory in Tianjin, China, 
sat forlornly at his factory's sales booth here this week. 
</P>
<P>
He was in this Cleveland suburb for the only Chinese trade show under way in 
the United States during the crisis in his homeland, and Liu was finding it 
very difficult to attract American customers interested in exporting the fine 
pens and pencils his government-run enterprise manufactures in Tianjin, about 
75 miles from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done any real business so far," Liu said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in China seems to have had an effect on "those American businessmen 
we have talked to," he added. "They are concerned that if an agreement is 
signed, that we could not deliver our products on time." 
</P>
<P>
In international business, as in so many other aspects of life, timing is often 
critical to success. 
</P>
<P>
And it would be hard to imagine any recent business event that has suffered 
from worse timing than the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition this week at a 
huge trade center next to Cleveland's airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protesters Lower Flag 
</P>
<P>
The trade show, sponsored by China's Council for the Promotion of International 
Trade features 50 Chinese industrial enterprises seeking to expand their 
exports to the United States. The show, staffed by 150 Chinese nationals, 
opened here last Friday with a gala, VIP luncheon attended by top Chinese trade 
officials -- just before last weekend's bloodshed began in the streets of 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The violent crisis in China appears to have scared away many potential American 
customers for the trade show's participants. 
</P>
<P>
Since the weekend, "few customers have come to look, and we have not signed any 
contracts," said Shi Hongmin, vice director of Shanghai No.3 Bicycle Factory, 
China's largest exporter of bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Some American import-export specialists browsing the trade show agreed that the 
political instability in China made them leery about making any commitments 
with the enterprises represented here. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if there will be very many businessmen coming in to open a letter of 
credit with the Chinese any time in the next few weeks or months," said one 
Cleveland-based importer who declined to give his name. "You don't know whether 
the current leadership in China will be around for a day, a week or a month." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Chinese managers of the show are sticking it out, even after a 
weekend protest outside their event by several hundred Chinese students 
studying in the Cleveland area. The students briefly lowered the Chinese flags 
flying outside the show to protest the violence in Beijing, after the show's 
managers refused to lower them to half-staff voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the show's managers insisted that they have no plans to shut down 
their exhibition before the scheduled close Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Xu Chenbin, marketing director for International Pacific Exhibition, the 
Chinese agency managing the show, also said that the group's scheduled show at 
the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, from Aug. 25th to Sept. 5th, will go on 
as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the group's 1988 Los Angeles show resulted in $70 million in 
sales, and Xu said Beijing doesn't want to cancel such a potentially lucrative 
event. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Families 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I called Beijing to my home office, and they said all overseas 
exhibitions will go on as planned," Xu said. "We have had no thoughts of 
canceling the show. 
</P>
<P>
"From the American side, I think the businessmen are concerned about what is 
going on in China, but from our side, we are trying to do business as planned." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Chinese here for the show, most of whom left China just 10 days to 
two weeks ago, are uncertain about what's going on at home, and are worried 
about their families. Many were nervous about discussing events in China, 
insisting that they knew only what they had seen on American television. 
</P>
<P>
But most said they still believe that the political turmoil will not have any 
lasting impact on trade with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They predicted that even a hard-line leadership would not turn away from 
China's recent economic opening to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"The open trade policy carried by China will not be changed -- that is my 
opinion as a businessman," said Jiang Yujun, vice chairman of International 
Pacific Exhibition. He also insisted that the trade show, the group's first in 
Cleveland, was going better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Unfazed by Crisis 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the crisis is causing some problems in our conversations with 
American businessmen," Jiang said. "But business is not bad. Cleveland is new 
for us, so we didn't expect much." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a few American importers with extensive experience in China were doing 
business here, unfazed by the crisis. Ali Alami, an import-export specialist 
from Youngstown, Ohio, signed an order for T-shirts with the Shiziazhuang 
Garment Import &amp; Export Co. on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Alami, who has dealt with the Chinese for three years, said the political 
turmoil didn't make him think twice about buying from China again. The bottom 
line profit available from China is still too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any problems so far, and their prices are still very 
competitive," Alami said.

PARAMOUNT LOSES COURT BID TO BLOCK TIME-WARNER DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Delaware judge Friday rejected Paramount Communications' request to 
temporarily block an anti-takeover clause of the merger agreement between Time 
Inc. and Warner Communications that Paramount feared could upset its rival 
$10.7-billion bid for Time. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the battle of the communication giants ended its third day, Time 
directors were believed to have set a meeting for Sunday, and there were signs 
of frantic lobbying by both sides in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, the stocks of the three giant media and entertainment companies 
were among the five most active in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Time 
rose $2.25 to close at $170.25, with 2.36 million shares changing hands. Warner 
closed at $56.125, down 37.5 cents. Paramount rose to a 52-week high of 
$59.125, up 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
In Delaware, the legal skirmishing attracted so many bystanders that Chancellor 
William T. Allen had to borrow a federal courtroom in Wilmington to accommodate 
the overflow crowd at the 85-minute proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon, Allen ruled that he found no reason to temporarily block 
a clause of the merger agreement that enables Time and Warner to swap huge 
blocks of newly issued shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount offer has triggered the parties' rights under the exchange 
agreement, which if exercised would leave Time with 8.7% of Warner's stock and 
Warner with 11.1% of Time's shares. Paramount has contended that the exchange 
could add $1.2 billion to the cost of acquiring Time at its current offer of 
$175 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount challenged the clause as an illegal "lock-up" that would have kept 
outsiders from making higher takeover bids that could have benefited Time 
shareholders. But Allen said a temporary restraining order on the swap was 
unnecessary, since a swap could be nullified if the court finds during the 
trial that the swap is improper. 
</P>
<P>
The restraining order thus "would not appear legally critical," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In separate statements, Time and Warner declared themselves "pleased" with the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount said it considered the decision "an extremely satisfactory one," 
contending that the court had "protected our position by assuring the status 
quo." The court denied the motion "solely because it has the power after a full 
hearing to undo any Time-Warner stock swap," a Paramount statement said. 
</P>
<P>
This claim of victory prompted an angry rejoinder from Warner spokesman 
Geoffrey W. Holmes, who called it "clearly a public relations effort to cover 
the fact that the court had turned down their request." 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, the Delaware chancellor also refused Paramount's request to 
force Time or Warner to give Paramount five days' notice if either Time or 
Warner decides to trigger the stock-swap agreement. Under that agreement, Time 
and Warner have an obligation to give each other five days' notice, but the 
court's ruling means "Warner and Time could agree to amend the agreement to 
exchange the shares immediately," said Charles F. Richards Jr., a Wilmington 
attorney who represented Warner in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The court indicated that Paramount can't possibly close its tender offer for a 
number of months. I think that is of some significance to the (stock) market," 
Richards said. "I think it has significance for the course of this case, 
because it indicates that the court feels that he has several months to hear 
the issues." 
</P>
<P>
In his eight-page ruling, the chancellor alluded to the central issue of the 
case, which is whether Time and Warner properly forged their stock swap merger 
deal they announced in March. Paramount has contended the deal did not do 
enough to see if other, higher bids were available; Time and Warner have argued 
that in a "merger of equals" the corporate partners do not have to start an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Swarming All Over' 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Allen wrote that the legal issues raised by the case "are ones that 
have not yet been addressed in Delaware or elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
As they have struggled in court, the companies also mounted intensive efforts 
to get across their point of view on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"They're swarming all over down there," said a member of the Paramount team in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists for the Time and Warner side have emphasized how much debt the 
Paramount deal would load onto Time's valuable package of entertainment and 
media assets; Paramount's representatives have stressed how much better their 
$175-a-share offer would be for stockholders, say Capitol Hill sources. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists on the Time and Warner side have gone further, several said, to urge 
legislators to contact Paramount and express their displeasure at the hostile 
takeover attempt, said one legislative source. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Media Ownership a Concern 
</P>
<P>
"I would say this is very aggressive stuff," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's team includes Washington attorney Joseph A. Califano. 
</P>
<P>
Among the targets have been members of telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and members of the 
communications subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel, chaired by Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), begins hearings 
Wednesday on the possible dangers of concentration of ownership in the media 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, for its part, announced that it has entered into a voting trust 
agreement with Donald Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense and White House 
Chief of Staff under President Ford, which -- if approved by the Federal 
Communications Commission -- would enable Paramount to actually acquire the 
Time shares pending transfer of numerous licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount also announced that it has retained lawyers all over the country to 
handle the requests to transfer licenses to cable television franchises now 
held by Time and its subsidiaries.

JOKES -- AND CLIOS -- ARE ON ORKIN RADIO RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Orkin must be laughing all the way home from the Clio Awards. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch, the Los Angeles production company whose 
radio ads are woven with wall-to-wall jokes, walked off Friday with six Clio 
Awards, all for different clients. The awards, among the most coveted prizes in 
advertising, are judged by industry professionals. 
</P>
<P>
One of Orkin's awards was for that familiar V-8 juice radio ad in which a 
future father-in-law hooks up his future son-in-law to a lie detector to see if 
the young man drinks V-8 juice. Another winning ad, for AT&amp;T cordless 
phones, features a man sitting in a hot tub with his girlfriend while talking 
on the phone to his suspicious aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Humorous advertising cuts through the clutter," said Orkin, whose company has 
won about 80 Clios during the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a more human way to sell products in a very cluttered marketplace," Orkin 
said in a telephone interview from New York, where he was attending the 
ceremony. Clios for the best television commercials of the past year are 
scheduled to be presented Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Orkin said the Clios are often more important to clients than to the ad 
agencies or production companies that enter the ads. "Clients like to know that 
something they've spent a lot of money on has won awards," Orkin said. 
</P>
<P>
In that event, many clients went away disappointed. Although more than 3,000 
ads were entered, only 33 awards were handed out. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, the Motel 6 ad campaign walked off with a 
major honor, this time, best national campaign. The ads, created by Dallas ad 
agency the Richards Group, feature folksy Tom ("We'll Leave the Light on For 
You") Bodett as spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, the Bodett ads were part of a regional campaign aired 
primarily in California. But the ads helped generate so much new business that 
the company decided to use a portion of those added revenues to take the 
campaign national, said Hugh Thrasher, marketing director of Motel 6. 
</P>
<P>
Bodett is under exclusive contract to Motel 6 for two more years, Thrasher 
said. And Bodett's success with Motel 6 recently led the resident of Homer, 
Alaska, to start his own syndicated radio show, "End of the Road Review." 
Naturally, Motel 6 is a sponsor of that show. 
</P>
<P>
In one of Bodett's current ad campaigns, he even sings the Motel 6 room 
reservations phone number. "Obviously," gibed Thrasher, "you don't have to hire 
the Boston Symphony to win awards." BRUCE HOROVITZ

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: PLUNGE IN RATES ADDS TO INVESTORS' QUANDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL SING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will interest rates continue to go down? What should I do about it? 
</P>
<P>
These are questions you and many other investors may be asking in the wake of 
sharp interest rate declines during the past three months. The plunge has been 
fueled in part by expectations of lower inflation and was augmented this past 
week by signs that the Federal Reserve was easing credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Even the release on Friday of the government's producer price report, showing a 
higher-than-expected inflation rate of 9.4% so far this year, failed to stem 
the falling interest rate tide. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors consequently have bet on lower rates, locking in longer-term 
certificates of deposit or longer-term bonds, or jumping into stocks. But not 
all analysts are convinced that rates can fall much further, pointing to the 
Fed's continuing concern about the threat of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
So should you join the crowd and bet on falling rates? 
</P>
<P>
The answer depends on how much risk you can take. The investment choices are 
many, but here are some relatively straightforward ones, depending on your risk 
profile: 
</P>
<P>
* "Safe and Secure" Investors. 
</P>
<P>
You're in this group if you're an ultraconservative investor who can't afford 
to lose a dime. Thus, you should stay away from long-term bonds or stocks, 
which could fall in value if interest rates rise. Stick with certificates of 
deposit, money market mutual funds or Treasury bills. All carry virtually no 
risk of loss of principal. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on six-month CDs and money market funds nationwide are averaging 9.06% 
and 9.08%, respectively, down considerably from their peaks in March and April. 
But several still carry annualized yields of 10% or more. 
</P>
<P>
According to 100 Highest Yields, a newsletter in North Palm Beach, Fla., 
California institutions offering six-month CDs with annual compound yields 
above 10% include Guardian Savings of Huntington Beach at 10.24% and Columbia 
Savings &amp; Loan at 10.02%. 
</P>
<P>
If you think interest rates will fall, it is still not too late to lock in a 
decent yield on a longer-term CD, says Robert Heady, editor of 100 Highest 
Yields. Institutions with the highest average annual yields on 2 1/2-year 
certificates are Sun State Savings in Phoenix at 11.2%, and Dominion Federal 
Savings in McLean, Va., and John Hanson Savings in Beltsville, Md., both at 
10.59%. 
</P>
<P>
As for money funds, consistently strong performers through the years include 
Vanguard Money Market Reserves-Prime (800-662-7447), currently paying a 10.1% 
annual compounded yield, and Flex-Fund Money Market Fund (800-325-3539) at 10%. 
The latter adjusts its management fee to keep the yield high. 
</P>
<P>
Also above 10% are two funds, Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar (800-645-6561) and 
Fidelity Spartan (800-544-6666), that are absorbing all management fees and 
expenses. Complete listings of all major money fund yields can be found every 
Thursday in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Six-month Treasury bills now yield 8.44%. But they have the advantage of being 
exempt from state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in the top 33% federal tax bracket, consider tax-exempt money market 
funds. They are free of federal taxes and currently yield an average of 6.02%, 
according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report. (That's equivalent to a 8.99% 
taxable yield if you're in the 33% federal bracket). Listings can be found 
every Wednesday in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Consistently strong funds in this group include Vanguard Municipal Bond Money 
Market at 6.6%, USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund (800-531-8000) at 6.6% and 
Calvert Tax-Free Reserves Money Market (800-368-2748) at 6.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Also consider money funds that invest only in tax-exempt California bonds. For 
California residents, they are exempt from state taxes as well as federal. 
Interestingly, Vanguard's version, Vanguard California Tax-Free Money Market 
Fund, currently boasts a higher compounded annual yield (6.7%) than almost all 
tax-free money funds that are exempt only from federal tax. 
</P>
<P>
* "Easy Does It" Investors. 
</P>
<P>
You're in this group if you can try for somewhat higher returns, in exchange 
for the modest risk of possibly losing a small portion of your capital. 
</P>
<P>
One option is intermediate-term bond mutual funds. They invest in bonds of 
maturities usually between two and 10 years that will earn slightly higher 
yields than money market funds and earn modest capital gains if interest rates 
fall. If interest rates rise, their yields should offset any capital losses so 
you won't have a net loss. 
</P>
<P>
Often recommended no-load funds in this group include Dreyfus U.S. Government 
Intermediate, Fidelity Government Securities and Vanguard Short-Term Bond. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in a high tax bracket, consider intermediate-term tax-exempt funds. 
Often recommended funds in this group include Vanguard Muni Bond Intermediate 
and Fidelity Limited-Term Munis. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate-risk investors also can buy mutual funds that invest in stocks 
stressing high dividends. Those payouts cushion against falling stock prices, 
making these funds less volatile than the market as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Often recommended no-load funds with income-oriented stocks include T. Rowe 
Price Equity Income (800-638-5660), Lindner Dividend (314-727-5305) and 
Vanguard Windsor II. 
</P>
<P>
* "No Pain, No Gain" Investors. 
</P>
<P>
You're in this group if you are willing to accept high risks in exchange for 
high potential returns. 
</P>
<P>
If you think interest rates are still heading lower, consider mutual funds 
investing in zero-coupon Treasury bonds. These bonds are sold at a discount, 
and you accrue interest by getting the full face value at maturity. 
</P>
<P>
That process makes zeroes one of the most lucrative and riskiest ways to profit 
from falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best ways to play zeros is through a group of no-load mutual funds 
managed by Benham Group (800-982-6150 in California). Each fund in the group 
has a different target year when zeros in the portfolio mature. The further out 
the maturity, the higher the potential return. Benham Target Maturities 2015 
has the highest potential, Benham Target Maturities 1990 the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
If long-term rates went down 1 point in a year from current levels, you could 
gain as much as 40% with the Benham 2015 fund, according to Donoghue's 
Moneyletter of Holliston, Mass. If long-term rates sank 3 points in that year, 
you could more than double your money, the newsletter says. But you can lose if 
long-term rates rise and you must sell before maturity. 
</P>
<P>
If you think stocks will keep rising, buy growth or aggressive growth stock 
funds. They have the potential to score the biggest gains in a bull market but 
the biggest losses in a bear market. Often recommended no-load funds in these 
groups include Janus Fund (800-525-3713), Neuberger &amp; Berman Manhattan Fund 
(800-367-0770), Scudder Capital Growth (800-225-2470), Twentieth Century Ultra 
(800-345-2021), Nicholas Fund (414-272-6133) and Fidelity Capital Appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
What if you think interest rates and inflation are headed higher? Consider gold 
or gold mutual funds. Gold prices have sunk for much of the past year, closing 
Friday at $358.10 an ounce at the Commodity Exchange, down $15.40 on a day 
inflation was reported to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts think the metal has dropped so far that it can't go much 
lower. Some argue that the price has fallen so low that major mining firms may 
start curtailing production. Abundant supplies have been a major depressor of 
gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
The riskiest and potentially most lucrative way to play gold is through gold 
mutual funds. They invest in gold mining company stocks, whose prices are more 
volatile than the metal itself. Gold funds are up only 0.51% so far this year, 
the second worst among fund groups tracked by Lipper Analytical Services after 
world income funds. History shows that gold funds are often most attractive 
after they've been performing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Often recommended no-load gold funds include Lexington Goldfund (800-526-0056), 
United Services Gold Shares (800-873-8637) and USAA Gold. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you may be among many investors whose risk preference doesn't fall 
entirely into any of these three categories. Accordingly, build a diversified 
portfolio with some money in each.

SKID ROW CULTURAL CENTER FACING CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of Another Planet, a Skid Row cultural center run by and for the 
homeless that is facing closure, launched a campaign Friday to save the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The center, a converted gas station at the corner of Wall and Boyd streets that 
opened last year, is an eccentrically decorated gathering place and the site of 
poetry readings, video screenings, chess games, jam sessions and other 
activities. It also provides homeless people with storage for belongings and 
two portable toilets. It is drug and alcohol free, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Eddie Tyler had been sub-leasing the site on a monthly basis to 
Clyde Casey, who runs the center and lives there. Tyler told Casey last month 
that Casey must be out by June 27. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler owns a wholesale Christmas card distributorship across a narrow alley 
from Another Planet. He said Friday that he served the eviction notices chiefly 
because he wants to use the entire lot on which the center stands for parking. 
Tyler now leases out about 30 parking spots on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is very limited in parking and we've lost two major nearby parking 
lots to building construction recently and we need the rest of that lot (for 
parking)," said Tyler, who plans to hire an additional 30 employees next month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition however, the center attracts a "bad-looking element" to the area 
and has hurt business, Tyler said. Other business people have called him to 
complain, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Objects collected at Another Planet ("I call it trash, they call it art," Tyler 
said) clutter some of the parking spaces Tyler rents on the lot, making parking 
difficult and sometimes impossible, he said. There have been auto break-ins and 
theft, and the increased influx of homeless people has caused sanitary 
problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The place stinks to high heaven," Tyler said. "I've been on this corner for 40 
years running a fine business and it's just grown into an unbearable 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler has repeatedly asked Casey to improve the situation and asked him to buy 
liability insurance, but always to no avail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who has been out of town for about a month, said in a phone interview 
that he "will wait and see" what happens when he returns Monday before 
commenting on what he intends to do about the eviction. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division had no knowledge of recent 
complaints about Another Planet. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barbara Frost, an organizer of the homeless who also has been living 
at Another Planet, launched a campaign to save the site Friday. She sees the 
place as the start of a major cultural center for the Skid Row area, one that 
fills a critical need, artistically and socially. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Wartell, a self-described "ex-addict," agreed. He said Another Planet 
helped him kick drugs. "This is the only drug- and alcohol-free place in the 
area. I stopped off here and it turned my head around." 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who said she plans to legally fight the eviction, has drafted a petition 
for the cause and is asking for donations. She denied Tyler's charges that the 
center caused parking problems and said that it reduced crime, not heightened 
it. Her ultimate goal is to buy the property. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could buy this corner," she said, as about 15 homeless people were 
busy around her, some playing the piano, others playing chess. In nearby alley 
ways littered with trash, others loitered about listlessly. "The (homeless) 
situation is so serious that nothing but extraordinary actions will turn it 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Kellman, owner of the defunct Wallenboyd Theater across the street from 
Another Planet, had been collecting donations from private individuals to pay 
Casey's rent of $350 a month. It would be "terribly discouraging" to see the 
center closed, he said. "It is one of the finest examples of self-determination 
of the homeless people."

CHANNEL 18 TO ADD CALL-IN SHOW IN MANDARIN ON CHINA CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KSCI-TV Channel 18 will broadcast a live call-in show in Mandarin on the 
ongoing crisis in China on Sunday as a supplement to the station's daily 
Chinese-language reports on the turmoil that have been airing for the last 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Intended as a forum for the nearly 500,000 Mandarin-speaking residents of the 
Los Angeles area, the call-in program will begin at 7 p.m. and feature several 
local experts on China, including Xiao Quing Wu, chairman of the Chinese 
Students and Scholars Assn. at UCLA, and Chang-Quing Cao, a Chinese journalist 
who is publishing a newspaper devoted to the crisis in China and then faxing it 
from Los Angeles to more than 800 outlets throughout mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like everyone else, (Chinese-speaking viewers) have a general interest 
and concern for what's going on in China, and the majority of them are 
especially hungry for any information they can get," said Karen Garces, KSCI 
sales manager. "Many of them have friends and relatives in China and we thought 
it would be a good idea to provide an outlet for this community to ask 
questions."

'DR. RUTH' TO HOST TALK SHOW FOR TEEN-AGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAM LOPEZ-JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Ruth Westheimer, who has been dispensing sexual advice to adults for years, 
is now going to host a cable-TV talk show for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex is not the main thrust," Westheimer said of the weekly series that debuts 
today at noon on the Lifetime channel. "What I'm really after is a celebration 
and an exploration of the teen-age years. . . . I hope adults watch it: They 
are going to learn how great our young people are despite the pressures." 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of "What's Up, Dr. Ruth?," she said, is to help teen-agers 
overcome the conflicts and questions they encounter during their often intense 
and confusing adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"Adolescence is a very stressful period," Westheimer said. "Many (teen-agers) 
experience the height of their sex drive, and they have anxiety about what to 
do with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
It's a new twist for the internationally known psychosexual therapist, who in 
the past has directed her sexual advice to adults through a variety of outlets, 
including her now defunct radio show "Sexually Speaking," the TV series "Good 
Sex!," the board game "Terrific Sex" and her most recent book, "Sex and 
Morality: Who Is Teaching Our Sex Standards?" 
</P>
<P>
She is no stranger to teen-agers, however: In last year's Heroes of Young 
America poll of 8th- through 12th-graders, the 61-year-old Dr. Ruth was named 
favorite female news maker. 
</P>
<P>
She said her own children -- Mariam, 32, and Joel, 25, whom she raised alone 
for about six years before she married Fred Westheimer -- played a large part 
in preparing her to host a teen show. 
</P>
<P>
The sex talk in her new show, the German-born therapist claimed, will be 
mitigated by an exploration into a wide variety of subjects -- from how 
teen-agers cope with living in broken families to steroid abuse and the 
pressures they face trying to achieve high scores on their college entrance 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
Lifetime says it has not heard from anyone complaining because it was using a 
sex therapist to host a show for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the program is providing a valuable service to today's teens and a 
forum for their special concerns," senior vice president Pat Fili said. 
"Parents can actively use the program as a starting point for conversations 
with their teen-aged children. We support the program wholeheartedly and do not 
feel that it is offensive." 
</P>
<P>
On the first of the 26 shows that Lifetime has ordered, Dr. Ruth will talk 
about how teens and their parents react to heavy-metal music. Members of the 
heavy-metal band "Anthrax" will be on hand, along with their mothers, to 
discuss their music. 
</P>
<P>
"How does a mother react when her child joins a heavy-metal band?" Westheimer 
asked. "I probably would hit the roof, but the parents (on the show) said they 
know they have to leave some freedom to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Though guests will occasionally appear, she said, the series will consist for 
the most part of discussions among the teen-agers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
On next Saturday's program, Westheimer focuses on peer pressure, discussing 
with the audience how to respond to sexual pressure on dates, the differences 
between sex and love, and roles in relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the answers," she said. "I just raise the issues. . . . Well, 
maybe I have some answers." 
</P>
<P>
She said that her stand on abortion, for example, will never change: "Abortion 
must remain legal. Especially for kids who can't afford to fly to Europe. I 
don't believe in it as a contraceptive, but when there is a contraceptive 
failure, the decision should be left up to the individual." 
</P>
<P>
Another public stand she has taken is the matter of premarital sex: She said 
she believes in it only in loving and committed relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Westheimer said that she is not worried that young viewers with emotional 
problems might be left hanging at show's end: "If they are truly unhappy, I 
stress ongoing therapy," she explained. "I tell them to go and look for help."

QUINTESSENTIAL WALKING TOUR FOR SUMMER DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT JOHN PIERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean Park, the southernmost neighborhood of Santa Monica, is the 
quintessential beach town. Along its wide, milk-white beach, thousands of 
visitors sunbathe and splash in the surf. Others fish from the municipal pier, 
ride the Ferris wheel and carrousel, pedal the bike path, stroll its oceanfront 
walk and roller-skate to Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet just three blocks inland, Main Street hosts designer boutiques, art 
galleries, museums, neighborhood cafes and trendy restaurants. Ocean Park 
offers something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a self-guided, three-hour walking tour of the neighborhood, 
including time to graze and gaze on Main Street. Be sure to wear comfortable 
shoes and sunglasses for this perfect summer walk. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Ocean Park, take Interstate 10 (Santa Monica Freeway) west, exit 4th 
Street and turn left (southeast). At Pico Boulevard, turn right and then left 
at Main Street; drive to Ocean Park Boulevard. Metered public parking is 
available between Main Street and Neilson Way just to the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Seaside Resort 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Park traces its beginnings to 1895 when Abbot Kinney joined Francis Ryan 
to develop a seaside resort amid a sandy expanse of hills and marshes. The 
resort grew in 1896 when a local interurban electric railway was extended south 
from Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
By 1900, Ocean Park had grown to a village of more than 200 cottages, boasting 
its own businesses, post office, race track, golf course, clubhouse and 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney left the partnership in 1904 to build his Venice-of-America to the 
south, sparking fierce competition for summer crowds. Positioned between Venice 
and the Santa Monica Pier, from 1910 to 1930, Ocean Park became the center of 
the West Coast's greatest concentration of midways, carnivals and pleasure 
piers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, little remains along the ocean front of these glorious days, but many of 
the turn-of-the-century beach cottages still exist and are occupied today. 
</P>
<P>
Begin the walk at the Heritage Square Museum, 2612 Main St. Built in 1894 by 
architect Sumner P. Hunt for the son of Santa Monica's founder, this Colonial 
Revival house has been restored tenderly and features changing historical 
exhibits, a bookstore and gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
Walk northward on Ocean Park Boulevard. Several nearby murals depict Ocean 
Park's character, including one at Main Street of the early 1900s beach resort 
and two bold murals below the 4th Street overpass, one of sea mammals and the 
other of the carrousel's wooden horses coming to life. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on 3rd Street, noting the "airplane bungalow" at No. 2544, with its 
overarching tiers of extensive eaves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Along Beach Street 
</P>
<P>
At Beach Street, turn right, walking past several Craftsman cottages at Nos. 
244-250. At No. 237 stands Ocean Park's oldest house, a small Victorian cottage 
built around 1885. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on 2nd Street. The two-story Victorian Hostetter House, built around 
1890, is set in a lush garden at 2601 2nd St. At No. 2621 stands Santa Monica's 
first church and oldest wood-framed structure, built in 1875 and moved here in 
1900. Today, it serves as an artist's residence and studio. Farther at Nos. 
2710-2730, a row of simple turn-of-the-century cottages still provide rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right at Ashland Avenue, walking towards the bay. Cross busy Main Street 
and Neilson Way and follow the winding walkway to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cross Barnard Way and turn left, walking parallel to the bike path. In 1987, 
Santa Monica completed its re-landscaping of the beach parkway, planting 
hundreds of palms and wide lawns. 
</P>
<P>
This seaside expanse from Ashland Avenue to Marine Street once was the site of 
several pleasure piers, most recently Pacific Ocean Park (P.O.P.). Built up in 
1958 as a joint $10-million venture by CBS and the Hollywood Turf Club to 
compete with Disneyland, P.O.P. consisted of a labyrinth of arcades, thrill 
rides, curio shops, cafes and a legendary roller coaster twisting above the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year, more than 2 million beach-goers visited P.O.P. But after 
years of declining crowds and revenue, the controlling interests filed for 
bankruptcy in 1967. Abandoned and deteriorating, victimized by fire and 
vandalism, the park finally was razed in 1975. Now the beach has been reclaimed 
as open space for public use. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Navy Street and left again on Main Street. Only 10 years ago the 
street was lackluster, lined with mom-and-pop stores and aging businesses. 
Today, Main Street has become a Melrose-by-the-shore with unique shops, stylish 
cafes and sidewalks crowded with "wannabes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Something for Everyone 
</P>
<P>
As you walk, note the rich variety of businesses, including One Life Natural 
Foods (at No. 3001), Superior Comics (220 Pier Ave.), the Garden Nursery (No. 
2935), Brilliant (orchids and bromeliads at No. 2912), the Buttery (croissants 
and muffins at No. 2906), Colors of the Wind (kites, pennants, flags and 
banners at No. 2900), Lakota (contemporary Southwestern artists at No. 2314), 
and the Ocean Park Omelette Parlor (the area's premiere breakfast hangout, at 
No. 2752). 
</P>
<P>
Farther on, you pass B-1 Gallery, Chinois on Main restaurant, Jadis Moderne 
(Art Deco delights) and Merlin McFly's Magical Bar and Grill (pub with live 
magic shows). 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Ocean Park Boulevard. Ocean Park's most intact turn-of-the-century 
neighborhood exists to the north. Its narrow streets, lined with late-Victorian 
and early Craftsman beach cottages, most with front porches and verandas, 
evokes a slower-paced time and place. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on Barnard Way and then veer right on Fraser Avenue. Many of the 
gabled cottages contain decorative shingles, brackets, brickwork and columns. 
Wind chimes and porch swings add to the setting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pure Victorian Elegance 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Neilson Way and left again on Hart Avenue. Turn right on Barnard 
Way and right again on Wadsworth Avenue. Among these residences, No. 151 is 
unquestionably the grand dame. Its towering front cupola, steep roof, 
elaborately hewn beams and deep veranda form a portrait of Victorian 
beach-front elegance. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on Neilson Way and left again on Hollister Avenue. Horatio West Court 
at No. 140, designed by architect Irving Gill in 1919, dramatically broke with 
the Craftsman style with its simplified mix of Mission Revival and Modernism 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
Cross Barnard Way and walk northward towards the pier. 
</P>
<P>
After passing the gazebo, turn left, walk down the stairs towards the pergola, 
and continue walking toward the pier. 
</P>
<P>
At 1910 The Promenade stands a five-story, brick-faced, Beaux Arts-style 
Pritikin Longevity Center, originally built in 1924 as the private Casa del Mar 
Beach Club. 
</P>
<P>
Farther on, you pass the Art Deco Sand and Sea Apartments at No. 1725, 
originally built in 1926 as the private Breakers Beach Club. Along its south 
wall artist Steve Thometz is painting a 132x40-foot mural entitled "Whaling 
Wall No. 6," commissioned by Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brains and Brawn 
</P>
<P>
Follow The Promenade northward, pass the public chess tables. Legendary Muscle 
Beach, with its gymnasts and fitness and physique fanatics, attracted thousands 
of beach-goers in the area south of the pier from the 1930s to the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Walk up onto the Santa Monica Municipal Pier. It's actually two adjoining 
piers, the northern section was constructed between 1909 and 1921 by the city 
of Santa Monica. The southern structure, the Newcomb Pier, was built in 1916 as 
an amusement center. In its heyday it featured a giant roller coaster, penny 
arcades and the cavernous La Monica Ballroom, where Big Bands played for 5,000 
dancers and 5,000 onlookers, all under its Moorish-styled roof. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Municipal Pier serves as a playground for every type of urbanite. 
Walk past the recently restored carrousel, Crown and Anchor Pub, quarter 
arcades, seafood cafes, souvenir stands and a fortuneteller to view the 
open-air historical photo exhibit. Then join the fisherfolk and couples at the 
pier's end. 
</P>
<P>
Turn around and walk up to the foot of the pier, admiring the sweeping views of 
Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right on Ocean Avenue and walk inside the new Loews Santa Monica Beach 
Hotel at No. 1700. Constructed near the site of the Arcadia Hotel, the city's 
first resort built in 1889, Loews recaptures the feel of beach-front elegance 
with its "contemporary Victorian style," five-story atrium, pastel colors and 
lush landscaping. The 352-room hotel was designed by Archisystems International 
of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Duck Into an English Pub 
</P>
<P>
One of the city's best pubs, the Mucky Duck at 1810 Ocean Ave., is known 
worldwide as an Anglophile watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
At Pico Boulevard, turn left. Then turn right on Main Street. Stop in Pioneer 
Boulangerie at No. 2012, a country French and Basque food emporium, as busy as 
a village marketplace with its garden patios, bakeries, wine shop, cafeterias, 
deli and Basque family-style restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
At No. 2215, the Main Street Dance and Exercise Gallery opens to the street, 
allowing live African percussion and Samba music to spill out to the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Stop in Napoleon French Bakery and Cafe at No. 2301, one of Ocean Park's most 
popular cafes. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Museum of Art complex at No. 2429, designed by Frank Gehry, 
houses the Gallery of Functional Art, now exhibiting a fascinating collection 
of "chair art." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, explore the Streamline Moderne Galleria di Maio at No. 2525. Reward 
yourself with a refreshment at a nearby cafe.

SANTA MONICA OKS MAJOR REVISIONS TO RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major revision of what is considered one of the toughest rent-control 
ordinances in the nation, the Santa Monica Rent Control Board will allow 
landlords to roughly double the rents on some apartments if they set aside an 
equal number of units for low-income tenants at lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the rent control board, which approved the changes Thursday night, 
and landlord representatives said at a joint press conference Friday that the 
voluntary program addresses the two major problems facing rent control today: 
making inexpensive housing available to poor people while providing landlords 
with a fair return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a workable compromise, and it's recognition that after 10 years of a 
restrictive ordinance, financial incentives are needed for the landlord," said 
Carl J. Lambert, president of Action, a Santa Monica landlords group. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Packer Davis, chairwoman of the rent control board, said that while the 
board has agreed to allow sizable rent increases for some vacated apartments, 
the poor, the elderly and disabled people for whom rent control was originally 
intended to help will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still being idealistic, but finding a pragmatic way of achieving our 
goals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that a change was needed. Landlords have left as many as 
several thousand apart ments vacant rather than rent them out at what they 
considered unreasonably low rates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many high-income professionals -- some paying thousands of dollars 
in under-the-table "finder's fees" -- were moving into two- and three-bedroom 
apartments near the beach for less than $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to do something to keep rent control viable and to be more 
responsive to the needs of the 1990s," said Wayne Bauer, a rent control board 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Renters make up 80% of Santa Monica's 90,000 residents. Of the estimated 40,000 
rental units, 34,000 are subject to rent control. The average monthly rent is 
slightly under $500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Effect Sept. 1 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Voluntary Inclusionary Housing Program, which will go into effect 
Sept. 1, was first proposed in 1984. The City Charter was then amended to 
permit such a change in the city's rent control ordinance, which was adopted 
into the City Charter in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But it was only in February that the board adopted a program. It allowed 
landlords to raise rents on a number of apartments equal to those set aside for 
low-income and "very low-income" tenants. Landlords were allowed a $300 
increase for apartments set aside for low-income tenants, and a $500 increase 
for units guaranteed for very low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Low-income tenants are those making less than 80% of the area's median income; 
very low-income residents are those making less than half of the median. A 
family of four would qualify as low-income if it had a total annual income of 
$30,400; it would qualify as very low-income with a total annual income of 
$19,950. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
Landlords ignored the program, however, dismissing the increases as minimal and 
objecting vehemently to a provision that required them to record the agreement 
with the title to their property for 30 years. Landlords said this would lower 
the value of their property. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the program was not working, members of the rent control board 
began negotiating with landlord representatives two months ago and agreement 
was reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an olive branch that is being offered from each side," board member 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
The program approved Thursday night allows larger rent increases under the same 
one-to-one ratio for low-income units. It also contains a provision that could 
reduce rents for some low-income tenants, something the old ordinance did not 
provide. Unlike the earlier program, it does not require any changes in 
property titles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rate Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Rents for the apartments set aside for low-income tenants would be determined 
by a rate schedule tied to a percentage of the area's median income, or by the 
apartment's current rent, whichever is lower. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a family of four with an income of $30,400 is assured of renting a 
three-bedroom apartment for no more than $618, or a family of four with an 
income of less than $19,950 could rent a three-bedroom unit for $412. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to ensure that low-income people would pay no more than 30% of their 
annual incomes," said Mary Ann Yurkonis, administrator of the rent control 
board. "We're trying to ensure that the affordable units go to the people who 
need them the most." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for guaranteeing units for low-income tenants, landlords will be 
able to raise rents on other vacated apartments by $400 and $900, depending on 
the size of the apartment and whether the unit set aside is for a low- or very 
low-income tenant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Incentive 
</P>
<P>
There is an extra incentive of $100 per month for setting aside a low-income 
unit for a tenant with children, and an extra $50 per month for a low-income 
tenant with a pet. 
</P>
<P>
The higher rates will put Santa Monica more in line with prevailing rates in 
other Westside communities. 
</P>
<P>
Craig L. Marcus, a Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. investment property broker, earlier 
this year released a study on apartment rents in the Westside that showed the 
average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Westwood was $1,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the units under rent control in Santa Monica are older, Marcus 
said, they will have to be substantially refurbished to get rents close to 
$1,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Program 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the program are hoping that with higher profits, landlords will 
refurbish their buildings, some of which have been allowed to deteriorate. 
There is also hope that many of the apartments that landlords decided to keep 
vacant -- an estimate that ranges from a handful to several thousand -- will 
return to the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane, a rent control advocate who disputes the notion 
that a significant number of high-income tenants live in rent-controlled 
apartments, called the program a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to now, rent control could only provide security to existing renters and 
low-income renters already in the community," Zane said. "We now have the 
ability to provide greater assurances in the long run of a mixed demographic 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REVISIONS TO RENT CONTROL LAW 
</P>
<P>
THE OLD LAW 
</P>
<P>
Under the rent control law in effect since 1979, rental units are treated 
essentially the same regardless of the tenant's income. The Rent Control Board 
has limited annual rent increases to an average of 4.5% per year for 10 years. 
The result is that the average monthly rent in Santa Monica is $480, far below 
the prevailing rate in nearby parts of Los Angeles. Critics of the law say the 
biggest beneficiaries of the law have been high-income professionals, whose 
rents have been kept artificially low. City officials also believe that 
dissatisfied landlords are keeping as many as several thousand rental units in 
Santa Monica vacant rather than rent them at the low rates. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW LAW 
</P>
<P>
The new law is designed to give landlords a financial incentive to rent to poor 
tenants, particularly the elderly, families with children or people with 
handicaps. The law will allow landlords to raise the rent substantially on 
apartments when they are vacated. In return, the landlords would be required to 
set aside an equal number of apartments for low-income renters. The amount of 
rent the landlord forgoes by renting to the low-income tenant would be more 
than offset by increases on the "deregulated" apartments. Officials hope the 
incentives will encourage landlords to rent many of the vacant units that are 
now being kept off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Who qualifies 
</P>
<P>
The law establishes two categories of poor tenants, "low-income" and "very 
low-income," as defined by federal formulas. Examples: In Santa Monica, a 
family of four is classified as "very low-income" if it makes less than $19,950 
a year and "low-income" if it makes less than $30,400. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly rents for poor tenants would be determined by the tenant's income and 
the size of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
For low-income tenants, the rent could be as low as $399 for a one-room 
apartment and as much as $618 for one with three bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
For very low-income tenants, the range would be $266 to $412. 
</P>
<P>
The incentives 
</P>
<P>
For each vacated unit set aside for a low-income tenant, landlords would be 
allowed to raise the rent as follows on vacated units rented to regular 
tenants: 
</P>
<P>
Single -- $400 
</P>
<P>
One bedroom -- $500 
</P>
<P>
Two bedrooms -- $600 
</P>
<P>
Three or more bedrooms -- $700 
</P>
<P>
For each vacated unit set aside for a very low-income tenant, the following 
increases would be allowed on vacated units rented to regular tenants: 
</P>
<P>
Single -- $600 
</P>
<P>
One bedroom -- $700 
</P>
<P>
Two bedrooms -- $800 
</P>
<P>
Three or more bedrooms -- $900 
</P>
<P>
Example: A landlord has two vacancies at the same time in one-bedroom 
apartments, each now earning the citywide average of $480 per month -- giving 
him a monthly total of $960. Under the new law, he rents one to a very-low 
income tenant for $320. In return, he is able to raise the rent on the other 
apartment to $1,180 -- giving him a monthly total from the two apartments of 
$1,500.

CHEMICAL CITED BY EPA NO LONGER IN USE, REFINERY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN and JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shell Oil's refinery in Carson, whose chemical emissions were cited in a 
federal report as posing one of the nation's worst cancer risks, stopped using 
the carcinogenic chemical responsible more than a year ago, a senior refinery 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We discontinued the use of that over a year ago," Shell refinery manager Ron 
Swofford said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials at a second Los Angeles County facility cited in the same 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report denied Friday that the plant's 
emissions pose a toxic threat. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Toth, plant manager of Baxter Pharmaseal in Irwindale, said his company 
is permitted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to use 1,000 
pounds of ethylene oxide daily. 
</P>
<P>
"We comply with all the laws and do not emit toxins into the atmosphere," he 
said. "Those numbers (in the EPA report) don't reflect the way we do business." 
</P>
<P>
The Shell Oil and Baxter Pharmaseal facilities were responding to an EPA 
report, made available Thursday by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), that 
indicated they are among 205 plants around the nation where neighboring 
residents face a theoretical lifetime risk of 1 in 1,000 or more of getting 
cancer from air emissions. Also included among sites in Los Angeles County was 
Micro-Biotrol's facility in Vernon. Baxter Pharmaseal was listed in the report 
by the name American Pharmaceutical. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal Corp.'s La Mirada chemical plant was listed among the nation's most 
hazardous plants with a 1-in-100 risk of causing cancer. Unocal denied Thursday 
that emissions from its plant posed a health threat. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA generally considers a 1-in-1 million risk acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agency, however, has said the report was based on old data and was 
not intended to assess public health risks at individual sites. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical posing the danger at Shell was the potent carcinogen hexavalent 
chromium, which Shell and most other refineries have used for years to control 
corrosion in cooling towers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA data, Shell emitted about 1,890 pounds of the substance in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chevron Studied 
</P>
<P>
The Chevron refinery in El Segundo, also studied by the EPA, released about 310 
pounds that year, producing a lower lifetime cancer risk of 7 in 100,000, 
according to Jim Weigold, deputy director of the EPA's Emission Standards 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Weigold said no other refineries in Los Angeles County were studied for 
hexavalent chromium emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Shell's Swofford said his refinery had switched to less dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"It has only been a few years ago that the subject came up," he said. "People 
immediately began to look for other ways. Some substitutes got developed by 
some of the suppliers of cooling water treating chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
On July 7, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, following the lead 
of the California Air Resources Board, is set to adopt a rule that would ban 
hexavalent chromium compounds in any cooling system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sterilize Hospital Gear 
</P>
<P>
At Baxter Pharmaseal, ethylene oxide is used to sterilize disposable hospital 
equipment, company spokesman Toth said. In gaseous form, it permeates the 
packaging of such items as oxygen masks and surgical trays. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Toth said, the chemical waste is incinerated but produces no harmful 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said the incineration process is about 99% effective and that 
the firm has no history of violations. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, located since 1961 in Irwindale, a San Gabriel Valley city of 1,230 
residents, is owned by Baxter International, a $7-billion-a-year Illinois-based 
corporation that Toth said is the largest medical supplier in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials at Unocal have said the La Mirada plant has not had a 
"reportable" release of styrene butadiene resin, the compound at issue in the 
EPA report, in the past 10 years. A release of more than one pound of the resin 
must be reported to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Unocal Corp. Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier said: "The allegations 
of cancer risk to employees and neighbors of the plant are simply not true. The 
La Mirada plant has always operated in accord with all laws and regulations and 
with the highest regard for the safety of the employees and the plant's 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Since July, 1988, manufacturers that use large amounts of butadiene and other 
hazardous chemicals must disclose the amounts they routinely release into the 
environment through such means as evaporation or stacks. These releases would 
include amounts smaller than one pound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Manufacturing Site 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Unocal plant has large amounts of hazardous chemicals on its 
site, it was not required to report any routine releases because it is not 
considered a manufacturing site. The plant makes the resin used in the 
manufacturing of latex paint and carpet backing, but its primary business is a 
solvent distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Micro-Biotrol in Vernon could not be reached Friday for comment on 
the EPA report.

SECRECY SHROUDS HAHN'S INVESTIGATION OF BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY and JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn's investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's 
financial affairs is being conducted under a veil of secrecy, and interviews 
with current and former city officials reveal that Hahn has placed his trust in 
an unusually large team of relatively unknown lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The legal team, headed by Assistant City Atty. Charles Goldenberg and including 
four other lawyers and a retired police detective, is the largest assembled in 
the memory of current and past city officials. When the investigation is 
complete, it is widely expected to face more intense public scrutiny than any 
previous legal case handled by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot recall any similar incident in the recent history of the office where 
so many lawyers and investigators were assigned to one case," said Burt Pines, 
who was city attorney from 1973 to 1981. "With this commitment of resources, it 
shows the case is being given the highest priority possible in the office." 
</P>
<P>
The five lawyers and the retired detective work in the city attorney's 
24-member Special Operations branch. "Special Ops," located on the cramped 16th 
floor of City Hall East, is a place where attorneys jockey for tiny window 
offices and labor over seldom-publicized civil cases and criminal misdemeanors 
in specialty areas such as consumer protection, slum housing, crack-cocaine 
houses, city campaign violations, environmental misdemeanors and obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
While not glamorous, these are the jobs many of the city's 348 lawyers angle 
for when they are ready to leave low-level positions prosecuting routine 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the close quarters and camaraderie in Special Operations, an 
unusual level of secrecy surrounds the Bradley inquiry. Attorneys who work only 
feet away from the team say they have no idea how it is conducting the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is to be a comprehensive look into all possible conflicts of 
interest by the mayor, beginning with his paid service to two financial 
institutions having business with the city and including the 
non-insider-trading aspects of his relationship with the troubled investment 
banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert and its indicted "junk bond" guru, 
Michael Milken. The inquiry is expected to take several months. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputy city attorneys interviewed for this story said the normal flow 
of "shop talk" has been cut off. Hahn and Goldenberg have even refused to 
disclose basic details about their work to the City Council committee 
overseeing the inquiry. And Hahn has refused through a spokesman to discuss 
even routine aspects of the case, despite repeated attempts by The Times to 
contact him. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Qualls, spokesman for Hahn, said last week that Hahn would not discuss how 
the lawyers investigating Bradley were chosen, what talents he thinks they 
bring to the case "or any other information." 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen current and former city lawyers familiar with members of the 
Bradley team agreed to discuss day-to-day life in the city attorney's office 
and the abilities of the team's lawyers only with the understanding that their 
names not be used. They cited career concerns and fear of retribution from 
Hahn, who has refused to allow the Bradley team's members to talk to the press. 
</P>
<P>
The tight clamp on information has left many in and out of City Hall wondering 
how the case is progressing. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a tremendous discomfort," Councilwoman Gloria Molina said at a recent 
City Council committee meeting. "I'm very nervous as a policy-making body -- as 
members of the council -- that (the investigation is) not going to be 
complete." 
</P>
<P>
Through Qualls, Hahn recently defended Goldenberg's efforts but did not 
elaborate. "I have been very pleased with the progress and thoroughness of 
their work," Qualls quoted Hahn as saying in response to queries from The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg, who took over Special Operations about two years ago, is best known 
for having overseen the city attorney's only other major investigation of a 
city politician in recent years -- the 1986 inquiry into City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre's illegal campaign expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Alatorre and his campaign workers were found to have illegally 
transferred huge sums from the campaign chest he raised as a state assemblyman 
into his new campaign chest for his City Council race. Alatorre was charged 
with civil violations, and his campaign workers -- including his sister -- were 
cited for criminal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn has said he chose not to seek criminal charges against Alatorre because 
evidence gathered by Goldenberg was insufficient to prove that the campaign 
fund transfers made by Alatorre's sister and other staffers were ever approved 
by the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some city lawyers say they were satisfied with the $141,966 civil fine 
that was levied against Alatorre, after which all charges in the case were 
dropped. The fine was paid largely from Alatorre's campaign funds. But other 
city lawyers -- and California Common Cause -- still believe Hahn and 
Goldenberg did not come down hard enough on Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause, said in a recent 
interview that the city attorney did not prosecute Alatorre "to the fullest 
extent. . . . We thought they sold out pretty much." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn in the past has defended his office's handling of the Alatorre case. 
Indeed, Hahn's continuing confidence in Goldenberg is evidenced by his decision 
to hand him virtual control of the Bradley case. 
</P>
<P>
While Hahn keeps in daily contact with Goldenberg, he is not directing details 
of the investigation, according to several deputy city attorneys. In fact, 
Qualls confirmed that the city attorney left even the choice of the legal team 
up to Goldenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg selected four attorneys from his Special Operations branch -- all of 
whom joined the city as criminal trial lawyers. They were brought into Special 
Operations under Goldenberg in the past two years and are described by numerous 
other city attorneys as loyal to their boss. 
</P>
<P>
Although a handful of the 24 attorneys in Special Operations have been 
catapulted into the public eye by highly publicized prosecutions, especially 
those involving slumlords or illegal toxic waste dumping, none of these 
attorneys are on the Bradley team. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues said the team's members reflect the wide mix of lawyers working for 
the city, having both strong and weak points. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is an overwhelmingly impressive group, but it is also not an 
embarrassing group or one that would look like it was put in there to dance 
around," one city lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley team includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Goldenberg, 39, who joined the city in 1980 as a trial deputy in the criminal 
branch after working as an assistant district attorney for Middlesex County, 
Mass. He received a bachelor's degree from Clark University in 1971 and a law 
degree from Suffolk University in 1974. Goldenberg rose to supervisor of the 
city's Central Trials division before getting his current job. 
</P>
<P>
Qualls, Hahn's spokesman, described Goldenberg as "a very straight-arrow 
prosecutor" and one of the office's "top managers." Former City Atty. Pines 
said he is "solid, competent and effective." 
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg is widely viewed by supporters and critics alike as a person who is 
extremely ambitious and who does not act or take a stand without backing from 
his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
One supporter said he has "alienated some city attorneys who see only the part 
of him that is always polishing his star. . . . He is, granted, a person who 
has a certain degree of opportunism, but he is also a can-do kind of person, 
and it's really refreshing to see that in the city attorney bureaucracy," the 
friend said. 
</P>
<P>
* Ellen Taratoot Friedmann, 38, Goldenberg's closest associate, who moved to 
Special Operations when Goldenberg was named its chief. Earlier, she assisted 
Goldenberg in the Alatorre prosecution, and in the wake of that case was 
assigned to write amendments to strengthen the city's law limiting campaign 
contributions. She now handles violations of that law. 
</P>
<P>
Friedmann received a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1971 and 
a law degree from Loyola University in 1983. Before law school, she was a 
researcher on weapons systems for RAND Corp. She has had relatively little 
trial experience, joining the city in 1985 as an entry-level trial deputy in 
the criminal branch and being promoted two years later to Special Operations to 
work on campaign violations. 
</P>
<P>
Although respected for her intellect, Friedmann has alienated some co-workers 
for at times accepting non-lawyer duties as an aide to Goldenberg. 
</P>
<P>
* Kevin T. Ryan, 36, who joined the office in 1985 as a trial deputy and moved 
into the new narcotics abatement unit of Special Operations a few months ago. 
He recently prosecuted six successful drug cases, in which he obtained 
temporary restraining orders against building owners to force them to eliminate 
crack-cocaine dealing on their premises. He is described by colleagues as "hard 
working." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan received a bachelor's degree from the State University of New York in 1975 
and a law degree from the University of San Diego in 1980. Before joining the 
city, he was a deputy district attorney in Kings County, Calif., and a lawyer 
for the South East Legal Aid Center in Compton and the Watts Health Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
* Edmund E. Fimbres, 37, who joined the office in 1977, is the longest-serving 
member of the team. He is considered a solid legal writer but has not 
prosecuted any recent major cases and has not risen rapidly in the city 
bureaucracy. His most recent assignment was to write the city's brief to the 
state Supreme Court on Proposition 103, the auto insurance initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Fimbres received a bachelor's degree from Pomona College in 1974 and a law 
degree from Stanford University in 1977. He joined the city as an entry-level 
criminal trial deputy and recently served as civil lawyer for the Department of 
Water and Power. He moved back to City Hall to join Special Operations late 
last year and is said to be "working extremely hard" on the Bradley case. 
</P>
<P>
* Henry (Buzz) Burr, 35, who only recently was assigned to the Bradley team, 
joined the office in 1979 as an entry-level criminal trial prosecutor and now 
works for the narcotics abatement section. In partnership with Ryan, Burr has 
successfully pursued a number of landlords for allowing crack houses, and 
several similar cases are pending. Before that, he worked in the civil branch 
on workers' compensation cases. 
</P>
<P>
Burr received a bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1974 and a law 
degree from USC in 1977. He took a leave from the office in 1985 to earn a 
master's degree in public administration at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
* Paul Franey, 57, a 23-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, 
retired in 1979 from the prestigious Air Support Division. He was hired in 1987 
to assist Special Operations lawyers on cases requiring investigative legwork. 
</P>
<P>
Because few lawyers in the city attorney's office have investigative 
backgrounds, Hahn also requested a separate investigation by the Los Angeles 
Police Department. It is being conducted by two veteran Los Angeles police 
detectives from the bunco-forgery division who are reporting to Chief Daryl F. 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the police assistance, some are questioning Hahn's decision to leave 
the nuts and bolts of the daily probe to Goldenberg and his team of lawyers, 
given the potentially far-reaching implications of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing where Hahn should be involved in it daily, hourly by 
hourly," said one former city lawyer who oversaw several high-profile civil 
prosecutions. Another former city lawyer, who worked closely with Goldenberg, 
said there is some concern that he will be overly cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"Goldenberg is a pure government employee . . . who doesn't take action on his 
own," that attorney said. "I am sure that he is petrified of something coming 
down on him over this Bradley investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another view is that because Goldenberg is operating under public scrutiny 
in the Bradley case -- which has generated far more interest than Alatorre's 
troubles did in 1986 -- his team will turn every stone and consider every legal 
aspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever internal tendencies the city attorney's office might have, they are 
going to be ignored, given the visibility of the matter at hand," said Zelman 
of Common Cause.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECOUNT CONFIRMS OUSTER OF VICE MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recount on Friday of the votes in a May 23 recall election, in which San 
Gabriel Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak lost his City Council seat by a nine-vote 
margin, has confirmed the results, said Deputy City Clerk Cindy Bookter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on the nose," said Bookter, the official in charge of the 
election-night tally. "They (Blaszcak's supporters) may not be happy about it, 
but I believe they're satisfied. I hope their faith has been restored in (the 
city clerk's) office. I feel so happy about this." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Blaszcak, who was accused of abusing his powers as a city 
official, have called for an investigation by the Los Angeles County district 
attorney, the secretary of state and the attorney general, claiming there may 
have been ballot-tampering. The final count was 1,903 for recall and 1,894 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Meredith, a spokesman for Friends of Frank Blaszcak, said that the recount 
had not changed his opinion that an investigation should be conducted.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER, NEIGHBORS TO DISCUSS CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer who wants to tear down a popular Studio City carwash and gas 
station to make way for a mini-mall, setting off a clash with neighbors who 
want it declared a cultural monument, said Friday he will meet with community 
leaders in hopes of negotiating a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Builder Ira Smedra will discuss changes to his proposed $15-million, two-story 
shopping center with representatives of five community groups, a spokesman for 
his company said. After the private meeting on Tuesday afternoon, local 
residents will gather to discuss Smedra's offer, neighborhood leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra's proposal to demolish the carwash and gas station at Ventura and Laurel 
Canyon boulevards, which dates back to 1929, has prompted Studio City 
residents, who oppose construction of the mini-mall, to demand that Los Angeles 
officials declare the site a cultural landmark. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to honoring the role of the automobile in the development of the 
San Fernando Valley, such a designation would preserve a unique 1950s-era 
structure topped by a tower of 55-foot-tall boomerang-shaped steel beams, 
residents contend.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRES URGES USE OF ADS TO FIGHT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres on Friday called on state health officials to require Los 
Angeles County to spend $1 million in unused state AIDS funds immediately for 
an intensive advertising campaign aimed at educating minorities about the 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Democrat's request was prompted by complaints from AIDS 
activists that up to $10 million of the $51.5 million allocated to fight the 
disease may go unspent this fiscal year, which ends June 30. In response to the 
complaints, Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) last week called for an 
audit of county AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last year, the volume of AIDS cases in our state has risen by 77% in 
the black community, 53% in the Hispanic community and 18% among Asian Pacific 
Islanders," Torres said in a letter to Kenneth Kizer, state health director. 
"Overall, minorities account for 22% of California adult and adolescent AIDS 
cases."

AN OUTCRY BY KOREAN CHRISTIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Korean Christians in Southern California have raised an outcry over 
recommendations on the reunification of North and South Korea issued by a 
conference organized by the National Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
The statement adopted at the April 23-26 conference in Washington, which 
included several North and South Korean pastors, said Americans should support 
proposals for withdrawal of U.S. troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea 
and should focus sympathetic attention on rallies and demonstrations by Korean 
people for peace and justice. 
</P>
<P>
A committee formed in Los Angeles by prominent Korean-American pastors has 
drawn up a counterstatement declaring that no moves should be made to remove 
the U.S. military presence in South Korea "until North Korea gives up its 
ambition to reunify Korea under communist rule . . . and North Korea has 
churches all over the country and allows people to worship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Key Issue 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major issue in the Korean community," said Myung K. Kim, publisher 
of the weekly Korean-language Christian Herald in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8,000 Signatures 
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 signatures have been gathered endorsing the counterstatement from 
Korean-Americans living in Southern California, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
A protest march and demonstration are planned for Sunday afternoon in 
Koreatown, and a Korean Christian prayer rally in the Shrine Auditorium next 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday night will focus further attention on the issue, 
Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
The April conference on Korean reunification did not make much news outside the 
Korean-American community except for the apparently unprecedented visit to the 
U.S. by a four-man church delegation from communist-ruled North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the group of two pastors and two interpreters was the Rev. Ko Gi Jun, 
general secretary of the Korean Christians Federation, which he said represents 
10,000 Christians in North Korea with the freedom to worship in about 500 "home 
churches." 
</P>
<P>
But three Korean Christian pastors interviewed this week in Los Angeles were 
skeptical. Reports from the Washington conference, at which delegates sang 
Korean hymns and read Scripture, indicated that "two of them could not sing the 
hymns at all and they did not seem to locate Bible passages very well," 
according to the Rev. Dong Sun Lim, senior pastor of the large Oriental Mission 
Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Head of Volunteer Group 
</P>
<P>
Lim heads a Christian group that has volunteered to help establish churches in 
North Korea once freedom of religious expression is guaranteed by the 
government. Lim was to travel there recently as head of a 32-man delegation for 
that purpose, but he backed down because of insufficient assurances, he said. 
Nine members of the group decided to go as individuals, and recently returned. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked to see just one of the 500 'underground' churches and (North Korean 
officials) couldn't show them any," Lim said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Chun Il Cho, pastor of the Korean Philadelpia Presbyterian Church in 
Los Angeles, said the counterstatement was sponsored by the Council of Korean 
Churches in Southern California and the Southern California Korean Ministers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The positions taken by the National Council of Churches and its counterpart 
Council of Churches in South Korea are "minority" viewpoints both in South 
Korea and in this country, the Los Angeles pastors said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we see freedom of religion in North Korea and that church people can 
move freely from one country to the other, we would like to see (U.S. troops) 
kept in South Korea," said the Rev. Sungsoo Whang, pastor of Los Angeles 
Presbyterian Church. Whang also said the April conference statement also would 
have the effect of inciting further agitation in South Korea, some of which he 
claimed was communist-inspired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minority Position 
</P>
<P>
A National Council of Churches official conceded in a telephone interview that 
the conference took what is regarded as a minority position. "That is 
indisputable," said Duane Epps, assistant general secretary for international 
affairs at the National Council headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"But the church, when it has been effective in history, has done what the 
Gospel has mandated it to do, to be faithful to the message of love and 
reconciliation," Epps said. 
</P>
<P>
Epps felt that the rapport between the North Korean church representatives, 
South Korean churchmen and Korean-American delegates was warm and authentic. 
"It was a rather fundamental breakthrough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Epps said that the Washington statement did not address the question of what 
needs to be done in North Korea to achieve reunification because "this 
particular conference was to discuss U.S. policy and the responsibility of U.S. 
churches vis-a-vis their government." He said a more balanced policy statement 
on the Koreas, which formed the background to the conference, was adopted by 
the National Council of Churches Governing Board in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Opposition Voiced 
</P>
<P>
Two former moderators of the Korean Presbyterian Church in America, a National 
Council member since 1986, were present at the Washington conference "and did 
not indicate opposition to the statement," Epps said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles pastors said they did not know the opinions of those 
representatives, but suggested that Koreans customarily keep quiet about their 
objections in the face of an overwhelming consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Whang added that the Rev. Keyong Kim, senior pastor of Young Nak Presbyterian 
Church, the largest congregation in that denomination, is one of the leading 
organizers of the petition drive to oppose the reunification conference 
statement.

CHURCH REFLECTS GROWING KOREAN ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the biggest Korean-American congregations in Los Angeles will move into 
a newly constructed church complex next weekend -- a $9-million symbol of the 
robust church activity among Korean-heritage Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Despite inconvenient parking and makeshift classrooms at their old Koreatown 
facility, the Young-Nak Presbyterian Church was ranked last year as the fourth 
fastest-growing U.S. church in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at Young-Nak services and religious education classes grew to more 
than 4,600 churchgoers on the average Sunday in 1987, according to the latest 
survey by the Church Growth Research Center in Bolivar, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"But we know many people stopped coming because of lack of parking and 
educational programs," an assistant pastor at the church said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seating for 1,200 
</P>
<P>
However, with an opening ceremony on June 17 and three morning services on June 
18, the congregation will find a new sanctuary seating 1,200 instead 850 and 
parking for more than 500 cars. 
</P>
<P>
The 4.7-acre site, which once accommodated an auto dealership, is on Broadway, 
east of Chinatown and not far from the intersection of the Pasadena and Golden 
State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"We were considering moving to the suburbs, but we decided to stay in the 
city," said the Rev. Paul Chang, an associate pastor. "We will have members 
coming from all directions." 
</P>
<P>
A fourth service, the church's first one in English, will be added to the 
schedule next month to serve second- and third-generation Korean-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Christian missionaries, mostly Presbyterian and Methodist, began work in Korea 
a century ago but it has not been until the last few decades that churches have 
shown remarkable growth. Buddhism and shamanistic beliefs still predominate, 
but a majority of Korean immigrants to the United States tend to be Christian 
or gravitate quickly to the community-serving Korean churches in this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Membership 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 70% of the Korean-descent population in Southern California belong 
to churches, predominantly Protestant, according to Myung K. Kim, publisher of 
the Korean-language Church Herald. Nearly 700 churches have formed in the Los 
Angeles-Orange County region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young-Nak Presbyterian Church, whose senior pastor since 1974 has been the Rev. 
Keyong Kim, has been worshiping in a building originally built as a synagogue 
in Koreatown. Little more than street parking is available nearby. Most church 
classes met in a nearby public school. 
</P>
<P>
Its namesake church in Seoul, South Korea, is one of the nation's 
"super-churches" with membership in the tens of thousands. In this country, 
Young-Nak is the largest congregation of the Korean Presbyterian Church in 
America, which will hold its national convention June 20-22 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the independent Oriental Mission Church and Young-Nak Church 
are considered the two largest Korean-language congregations with about 6,000 
and 5,000 members, respectively.

U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who has been sharply criticized by many 
of his fellow evangelical Christians for his positions on AIDS, has struck back 
in an interview in the June issue of Charisma &amp; Christian Life. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Presbyterian, who will leave his federal post Oct. 1, 
specifically criticized positions taken by James Dobson, president of the 
Pomona-based Focus on the Family, and the Rev. D. James Kennedy, a prominent 
television preacher and outgoing moderator of the Presbyterian Church in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Koop debunked several assertions made by author Gene Antonio in his book "The 
AIDS Cover-Up," such as the contentions that AIDS could be spread by kissing 
and mosquito bites. Then interviewer Steven Lawson said: "James Dobson, James 
Kennedy and other Christian leaders have referred to some of the same 
conclusions as Antonio. These are very credible voices within the Christian 
community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reprehensible' References 
</P>
<P>
In response, Koop said that "the Christian activity in reference to AIDS of 
both D. James Kennedy and Jim Dobson is reprehensible. The first time that 
Kennedy ever made a statement about AIDS, I saw it on television. It was so 
terrible, so homophobic, so pure Antonio that I wrote him a letter." 
</P>
<P>
Koop said he and Kennedy had gone to the same church years ago in Philadelphia 
and "both became Christians under the same man." He said he wrote to Kennedy, 
who is pastor of the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 
"and told him how far off base he was in his comments about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general said he had offered to give Kennedy a briefing about AIDS 
but the offer was never accepted. Koop said: "Kennedy wrote me a letter full of 
this trash and rubbish out of Antonio's book. I responded to it thoroughly, 
paragraph by paragraph. I never heard a word from him." 
</P>
<P>
Koop recalled that he and Dobson had made some films on the AIDS epidemic and 
that the Focus on the Family president "was with me completely." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poor Scholarship' 
</P>
<P>
But then, the surgeon general said: "I don't know what happened to him. He 
changed his mind, and last August in his paper he attacked me for two pages as 
leading people down the garden path. But again his arguments were full of 
holes. I just cannot believe the poor scholarship of so many Christians." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general said AIDS offers "an opportunity for Christian service. We 
have an opportunity for evangelism to those who are sick, and it is an 
opportunity for Christian witness to those who are watching." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from Kennedy or Dobson.

TRADITIONALIST EPISCOPALIANS FORM THEIR OWN 'CHURCH WITHIN A CHURCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionalist Episcopalians have formed a "church within a church" in an 
effort to hold their ground against what they consider to be increasingly 
liberal tendencies within the 2.5-million-member denomination. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting June 1-3 in Ft. Worth, the traditionalists voted to establish the 
"Episcopal Synod of America" as a way of staying within the church while 
providing an ecclesiastical framework for those who strongly oppose such 
church-endorsed concepts as the ordination of women and revisions to the Book 
of Common Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the meeting, which was called by the traditionalist Evangelical 
and Catholic Mission, repeatedly declared that their action does not represent 
a schism and is within the laws of the church. 
</P>
<P>
However, formation of the structure appears to lay the groundwork for a 
head-to-head confrontation with the Episcopal Church hierarchy, which has 
strongly opposed the establishment of "parallel" jurisdictions that could 
create divided loyalties within the church. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning was abroad during the Ft. Worth gathering. 
Browning last month issued his first pastoral letter, cautioning against 
"precipitous actions" at Ft. Worth that could further divide the Episcopal 
Church and pleading for church unity.

METS, STUMBLING IN THIRD PLACE, ARE SHOPPING FOR A POWER HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets may have bullied the Chicago Cubs and Rick Sutcliffe for 10 
runs in one game this week. But when they fell back in form Thursday by losing 
to Chicago, 5-4, in 10 innings, they offered yet more proof that big-run games 
are more often teases than trends. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the recent years gone by, the Mets' offensive tap has more often been 
off than on this season. Because it is, the Mets find themselves stumbling 
about in third place in the National League East, 3 1/2 games behind the 
first-place Cubs, who outscored the Mets, 33-21, in taking three of the four 
games in this series. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of offense is the biggest reason why the Mets are culling the market 
for another hitter. "So far, we've looked under just about every rock there 
is," Joe McIlvaine said. "We haven't found one, though. At least one another 
team is willing to give up." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the dilemma. The Mets, as rich in talent as any team in baseball 
for the last half decade, are used to dealing from strength. The question these 
days is, "Have the Mets failed to deal because they are now just another 
vulnerable franchise with no good Samaritans volunteering to save them?" 
</P>
<P>
No, says McIlvaine, the Mets' vice president of baseball operations who does 
the wheeling and dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, McIlvaine has been trying to work a deal of considerable worth since 
December. And he's been turned back at every juncture, something new to a team 
that, in the not-so-distant past, appeared only to have to snap its fingers to 
have a Kevin McReynolds, Bob Ojeda, Keith Hernandez or Gary Carter fall in its 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Mets have coveted a prime-time hitter since December, but still they 
have not snared one. They wanted Seattle center fielder Jay Buhner, the player 
the Mets believed to be the other "plum" in that Mark Langston deal that wound 
up as a frustrating trade-that-never-was. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have held other talks involving, to varying degrees, Kansas City's 
Danny Tartabull, Atlanta's Dale Murphy, Cleveland's Joe Carter, the 
Philadelphia Phillies' Von Hayes as well as Boston's Ellis Burks. 
</P>
<P>
Some negotiations still go on. 
</P>
<P>
A mere mention this week by McIlvaine that he is still talking to Boston about 
Burks set off a storm of media interest as soon the Red Sox center fielder 
stepped foot in Yankee Stadium Thursday. It also set off another series of 
denials by Sox General Manager Lou Gorman, who stated the Mets would never give 
enough to pry Burks loose. 
</P>
<P>
That's generally interpreted by most to mean that the Red Sox want at least two 
pitchers capable of starting, plus Len Dykstra. And that's about one prime-time 
player more than the Mets would part with. 
</P>
<P>
So McIlvaine waits for the other side to crack. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because we don't have to make a trade," he said. "I still feel we have a good 
enough team to win." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine believes that, even though Carter and Hernandez are disabled and not 
expected back any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't replace those kind of impact players in kind," McIlvaine said, "but 
it hasn't been a devastating blow because the guys who stepped in, (Dave) 
Magadan, (Barry) Lyons and (Mackey) Sasser are hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Magadan, the replacement for Hernandez, was hitting .324 with nine RBI 
in 108 at-bats entering Thursday's game. Hernandez had 12 RBI in 117 at-bats 
when he broke his kneecap May 17. Lyons (.301) and Sasser (.324) combined for 
12 RBI in 130 at-bats. Carter had five RBI in 79 at-bats when he was placed on 
the disabled list May 12. 
</P>
<P>
The subs are not the reason the Mets had the second-worst team batting average 
in the National League. The regulars were. 
</P>
<P>
The homer Kevin McReynolds hit off Mitch Williams to tie the game in the ninth 
Thursday was only his seventh. The RBI was just his 25th. Darryl Strawberry has 
13 homers, but only 29 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
One can only imagine where the Mets would be without Howard Johnson, who 
homered Thursday and leads the Mets with 33 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
So, as the Mets wait for an offensive breakout, only to come away disappointed, 
execs like McIlvaine are looked to for answers, if not miracles. 
</P>
<P>
If power is what the situation demands, the Mets will not find it in their farm 
system. The otherwise-rich franchise is not exactly speeding a Jose Canseco or 
Ken Griffey Jr. through the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
So that leaves McIlvaine to parry with teams that want to envision a 
desperation on his part and raid the Mets' vast pitching riches. Right now, 
he's not alone in wondering how long a pitching-thin club such as Boston can 
hold out. For that reason, McIlvaine says of the pursuit of Burks, "I haven't 
given up on that one. And I don't give up easily." 
</P>
<P>
Will he get his man, from Boston or elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to overpay," McIlvaine said. "But there are lines I won't cross." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, to the Mets' dismay, no team has willingly crossed either, no matter 
how often pitching prospect David West or Sid Fernandez or outfielder Len 
Dykstra is dangled. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we being frozen out?" McIlvaine said. "Well, I'm beginning to think teams 
are shying away, but I don't know quite how to say why. I don't think it's 
personality. I don't know if it's our track record. I try to be equitable."

NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC SAYS PAIN WON'T STOP HIM; 
</P>
<P>
LAKER STAR WOULD PLAY DESPITE INJURY, BUT NOT AT RISK OF CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers flew from Detroit to Los Angeles Friday morning in a commercial 
DC-10, not in an air ambulance equipped with cots and staffed by nurses. 
</P>
<P>
But with Magic Johnson and Byron Scott nursing hamstring injuries, and their 
teammates soothing bruised egos, the Lakers certainly seemed in need of 
assistance. In fact, Scott and Johnson were taken to the boarding gate in a 
motorized cart. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday, when the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons will play Game 3 of the 
National Basketball Assn. championship series, Johnson and Scott will have 
received all available treatment in hopes that one or both guards will be able 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, at an impromptu news conference on the plane, Johnson tried to 
sound encouraged about his status, which the Lakers are calling questionable. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm hoping and wishing it is (feeling better)," said Johnson, who 
aggravated the left hamstring injury he had suffered in February. "We'll just 
have to wait and see. It's a situation where it's still sore. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always hope. I got to believe in that. You're hoping for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's injury has been diagnosed as a strain, less severe than Scott's 
partially torn left hamstring. He said that he will try to play Sunday, even if 
his injury renders him somewhat immobile. But he also said he will not risk 
shortening his career to play. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to go out there and hurt the team, then I don't want to be out 
there," Johnson said. "But if I can play well enough to help them, I will. 
That's what I got Dr. (Robert) Kerlan and (trainer) Gary Vitti for. If that was 
to happen -- like hurting myself for next year -- I wouldn't go out there." 
</P>
<P>
Not knowing whether he will have either starting guard, Laker Coach Pat Riley 
said he has to prepare for the worst. Riley's options, it seems, are to start 
Tony Campbell and Michael Cooper at guards, or move James Worthy to a shooting 
guard and start Orlando Woolridge in Worthy's small-forward spot. This much is 
certain, if Johnson and Scott cannot play, Campbell and rookie point guard 
David Rivers will. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet," Riley said of his lineup possibilities. "There are a lot of 
alternatives. I could go big or small. I'll have to sit down and think about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Riley might be leaning to a smaller lineup simply to match up better with the 
Pistons' guards. In Game 1, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Vinnie Johnson 
combined for 65 of Detroit's 109 points. In Game 2, the three accounted for 72 
of Detroit's 108 points, Dumars leading with 33. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find a way to control their guards," Riley said. "That's the main 
thing. We've been playing 6-9 and 6-8 guys against 6-2 guys, and it's 
physiologically impossible to keep up with that quickness. They are just 
burying their shots." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who made only 42.4% of their shots in the Eastern Conference 
finals, have improved to 54.8% after two games in the finals. Thomas, Dumars 
and Johnson have shot 57.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy (Pfund, a Laker assistant coach) said before this that they were due to 
break out," Riley said. "I guess they have." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that, being home now, it is the Lakers' turn to break out. 
</P>
<P>
Is that possible without Johnson or Scott in the lineup? 
</P>
<P>
"People started talking about our courage and heart," Riley said. "But this 
team, all they really did was lose two games. It doesn't matter how they lost 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Pistons) did their job and won two games at their place. I don't want 
thoughts of moral victories by saying that they couldn't put us away (in Game 
2). If we get a win Sunday, we are back in it and give them something to think 
about. We can do that." 
</P>
<P>
In five games without Johnson this season, the Lakers went 3-2. One of the 
losses was to the Pistons by eight points at the Forum on Feb. 14. The other 
was to the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, the night Johnson injured his 
hamstring while trying to avoid Manute Bol on a layup. 
</P>
<P>
They got the three victories against two teams with sub-.500 records -- the 
Portland Trail Blazers and the Sacramento Kings -- and the Boston Celtics, who 
finished 42-40. 
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence," Riley said. "Until I find out whether Earvin can play -- 
and from the information I've received, he's doubtful -- I have to move forward 
and prepare to play without him." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the Lakers will have to alter their offensive priorities 
drastically if neither Johnson nor Scott plays in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the way it's going to have to be," he said. "The guys who 
haven't been called upon to score are going to have to. I could get used to 
(shooting more) real quick." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said that the current state of the Lakers reminds him of the 1983 
championship series against the Philadelphia 76ers. In that final, Worthy, then 
a rookie, was already out with a broken leg. Bob McAdoo suffered a pulled 
hamstring in the Western Conference finals, and Norm Nixon had a separated 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were swept in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"That flashed across my mind," Cooper said. "But we can't think about that now. 
We just got to play with what we got." 
</P>
<P>
Though crestfallen because of the injuries to Johnson and Scott, the Lakers 
apparently aren't seeking sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen it happen to other teams, teams that we played against," Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar said. "We've been pretty lucky not to have many injuries over the 
years. We'll let fate -- or whatever -- do what it will and see what happens. I 
know we'll give our best effort."

FRENCH OPEN MEN'S FINAL IS IN FOR A CHANG; 
</P>
<P>
17-YEAR-OLD ADVANCES IN 4 SETS; EDBERG WINS IN 5 
</P>

<P>
He's so young, he's so small and his serve is so-so. So how is Michael Chang 
doing it in the French Open? 
</P>
<P>
Is he hotter than cafe au lait? Tougher than a week-old baguette? 
</P>
<P>
After four hours nine minutes of some glasnost with rackets Friday, Chang was 
only slightly higher than the bottom of the Seine. The muscles cramped in both 
his legs so badly that he had to be carried out of a television interview room. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be OK for Sunday," said Chang, who was certainly OK on the court 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The clouds cleared and the sun came out at Stade Roland Garros, which meant 
that there was a chang(e) in the weather, too. For 34 years, the forecast for 
the month of June has been extremely dry for Americans in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Chang has a chance to do what no male player from the United States 
has done since Tony Trabert in 1955. He can win the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a bigger, stronger opponent, Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, the 
15th-seeded Chang mined a 6-1, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 semifinal victory from the 
red clay of center court. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition in the final will be provided by third-seeded Stefan Edberg of 
Sweden, doing such a good clay-court impression of Bjorn Borg that he can 
probably change his name now to Edborg. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-hour 55-minute power struggle of serve and volley, Edberg defeated No. 2 
Boris Becker of West Germany, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The key game was the second in the fifth set. Becker had broken Edberg's serve 
to start the set and had a chance to go up, 2-0, with two game points, but he 
played two poor shots, sending the score to deuce and eventually losing his 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little lucky to break him," Edberg said. "I think that's what really 
got me back in the match." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who lost to Edberg in last year's Wimbledon final, knew he had missed 
his opportunity in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was really on top of him," Becker said. "He was looking a little 
bit exhausted. And I had 40-15, a big chance. I guess I got a little tight 
about it, a little anxious. 
</P>
<P>
"At 40-15, I gave him new life," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, 17 years 3 1/2 months, aged considerably in his semifinal match against 
Chesnokov, who plays tennis as if he were a goalie, knocking back shot after 
shot. Chang found himself obliged to play a game of endurance that left him 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
After completing a round of postmatch television interviews, Chang doubled up 
with muscle cramps. He stayed on his feet and walked for nearly an hour in the 
locker room after the match. 
</P>
<P>
"He was totally exhausted," said Jose Higueras, Chang's clay-court coach. 
</P>
<P>
While Chang was on the court, though, he employed his run-down-everything style 
that has made him popular here. 
</P>
<P>
It was so ridiculously easy for Chang in the early going -- he won the first 
set in 28 minutes -- that another heavy dose of Changmania seemed possible. 
Chesnokov's two-handed backhand was faulty, and he fell behind, 3-0, in the 
second set, playing his stodgy, conservative style, but then he began finding 
his target. 
</P>
<P>
As Chang pointed out: "With a match like that, you never think you have it." 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov broke Chang's serve to even the match at 3-3 in what was a typical 
game in the match. Chang had five game points and saved two break points before 
losing the third one. 
</P>
<P>
The comeback was soon complete for Chesnokov. When Chang misplayed a backhand 
volley, Chesnokov held two set points and he cashed in the first one as Chang 
sent an overhead into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Always more comfortable at the baseline, Chang still looked to take any balls 
Chesnokov hit short and to come in to the net. But the match might have turned 
on an error by Chesnokov, on a rare trip to the net. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th game of the third set, Chang was serving to stay in the set at 4-5. 
Chesnokov held three break points and blew them all. Chang eventually held 
serve on his sixth game point when Chesnokov's backhand approach shot flew 
long. 
</P>
<P>
"He played the big points better," Chesnokov admitted. 
</P>
<P>
They moved on to a tiebreaker, and Chang took a 5-4 lead. He had a set point 
when Chesnokov's backhand passing shot went long. Then he closed out the set 
when he got a short ball, driving it so deep that all Chesnokov could do was 
put up a lob, which Chang put away with an overhead. 
</P>
<P>
At 4-4 and a break apiece in the fourth set, Chang saved a break point to hold 
serve. Chesnokov now had to hold serve to stay in the match. He did it but not 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
Two match points were there for Chang, but he couldn't cash them in. He did, 
though, on the next opportunity, with Chesnokov serving once again to stay in 
the match at 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
In that 12th game, Chang angled a volley winner at 15-30 to give him two more 
match points. This time, he closed it out. Chesnokov netted a backhand from the 
baseline, picked up his bags, waved to the crowd and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Chang seemed fine when he left the court but needed assistance after his 
interview with ESPN had ended. Higueras said that beating Chesnokov had taxed 
both Chang's mental and physical conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Higueras seemed worried about neither. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the head of a champion," Higueras said, perhaps hoping the other parts 
of Chang would fall in line. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally met the press, nearly three hours after his match, Chang was 
subdued. His opportunity to become the youngest French Open winner as well as 
the first American winner in three decades wasn't particularly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think about those things because it's an added pressure for 
me," Chang said. "I'm just going to go out there Sunday and try my best."

Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang has entered the $425,000 Volvo Tennis/Los Angeles tournament 
Sept. 16-24 at the L.A. Tennis Center at UCLA, tournament director Robert 
Kramer announced in Los Angeles. . . . It was a strange postmatch press 
conference with Andrei Chesnokov. He answered questions in Russian and spoke 
through an interpreter, even though he has spoken in English at every other 
press conference for two weeks. Chesnokov, who has smiled and joked with the 
media before here, was sullen this time. When asked if he would keep his 
semifinal check, he said: "I don't understand the question. I came here to play 
a tennis tournament. I didn't come here to collect a check." Asked the same 
question Wednesday, Chesnokov had jokingly suggested that he would keep $72,000 
of the $73,000 check.

IN DESERT HEAT OF '81, LEONARD-HEARNS I BURNED INTO HISTORY

Wednesday, Sept. 16, 1981, was a hot night here, but there were 25,000 people 
in a parking lot stadium in the Nevada desert. Two young boxers were about to 
engage one another for 14 memorable rounds in a contest that still stands, in 
the minds of many of those who were there, as the fight of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night when courage, skill and endurance were at center stage. But most 
of all, it was a night of savagery, a night when two immensely talented young 
boxers, each in his prime, fought with an intensity that an entire generation 
of boxing followers will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
It was Leonard-Hearns. Seven years nine months later, we have Leonard-Hearns II 
here Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
This time, only the site, Caesars Palace, is the same. Sugar Ray Leonard, a 3-1 
favorite Monday, is 33 now. Thomas Hearns is 30. That night in 1981, Leonard 
was 25 and Hearns was 22. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is the athlete he was eight years ago, but that won't matter when they 
pick up their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 16, 1981, Leonard earned about $10 million when he stopped Hearns in 
the 14th round. Hearns made about $5 million in a fight that brought in about 
$50 million. This one is expected to bring in $70 million to $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard will make at least $13 million, Hearns $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about their 1981 fight, both fighters agree that what happened that 
night won't have a bearing on what happens Monday. It was a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but the memories remain. This one isn't lost in time's mists. It remains 
vivid, alive. 
</P>
<P>
Like other great boxing events of the 1980s -- Leonard-Marvin Hagler, 
Hearns-Hagler, Evander Holyfield-Michael Dokes -- this one had ebb, flow, 
explosiveness, elation and heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
Both were welterweights that night. Both owned pieces of the world 
championship. Hearns (32-0) had never been beaten. Leonard (30-1) had lost only 
to Roberto Duran, a defeat he had avenged in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard was a 7-5 favorite when they entered the ring, both wearing white 
robes, to the booming strains of the "Rocky" theme. Leonard weighed 146 pounds, 
Hearns a whippet-like 145. Monday, they will be in the low 160s. 
</P>
<P>
During the ring introductions, someone looked at a thermometer. It was 97 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round, Leonard wheeled around the ring laterally, throwing an 
occasional jab at Hearns, who stalked Leonard, flat-footed. 
</P>
<P>
The second round was the same, and it was clear that Leonard was acutely 
conscious of Hearns' vaunted right hand, which Hearns kept cocked. Early in the 
third, Hearns began throwing right-hand bombs, and the crowd came to its feet, 
roaring. 
</P>
<P>
But he missed with them, as he would all night. One shot hit Leonard on the 
shoulder. Another grazed the top of his head. Leonard ducked under one on the 
ropes, escaping the punch, and his momentum nearly toppled Hearns over the top 
rope. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, that exchange at least slightly lessened Leonard's fear of Hearns' 
right, because at the end of the round he was throwing big rights himself. He 
went after Hearns, wide open, seemingly daring him to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five seconds into the fourth, Hearns connected. A straight right rocked 
Leonard at center ring but only for a second. Leonard was clear-headed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
After five rounds, Hearns seemed to be ahead on most cards, and chants of 
"Tom-mee! Tom-mee!" went up. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the sixth. If Leonard-Hearns I is still the fight of the '80s, then 
Round 6 of of that bout is at least the second-best round of the '80s, slightly 
behind Round 1 of Hearns-Hagler. 
</P>
<P>
Ten seconds into the round, Leonard cracked Hearns on the jaw with a sneaky 
right hand. With a minute left, Leonard badly hurt Hearns, on the ropes, with a 
left uppercut to the jaw. But just as it seemed that the Hitman had had it, he 
lashed out at Leonard and hurt him with a left hand. With the roar of the 
excited crowd rolling across the desert, Leonard staggered Hearns with a short, 
hard right. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns was hurt and on the ropes when the round ended. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard came out for the seventh and led with a thumping left hook to Hearns' 
ribs, and the blow momentarily froze Hearns. He bent over and tried to hang on. 
His legs were wobbly, and it suddenly seemed as if the sixth had eaten up 
Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the eighth, Leonard caught Hearns in a neutral corner and hurt 
him with a long right. Leonard seemed to be in complete command of a rapidly 
failing opponent. But Hearns came out for the ninth surprisingly fresh and went 
up on his toes. He became a dancer instead of a stalker, and for four rounds 
Leonard couldn't catch him. And Leonard had a problem -- his left eye was 
rapidly swelling shut. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns landed some long, powerful jabs and padded a narrow point lead he had 
held at the end of nine. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Hearns had survived. There he was, in Rounds 9 through 12, in cruise 
control, piling up points. The Hitman was coming down the stretch, in charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom-mee! Tom-mee!" 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a twinkling, it all changed. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th, a desperate Leonard caught Hearns with a right. Hearns lashed back 
with a right of his own, but Leonard shook it off and charged Hearns. With 
seconds left in the round, Hearns was helplessly sprawled on the ropes, and 
referee Davey Pearl had started a count over him at the bell. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14th, Leonard hurt Hearns with a hard right, low on the left side of 
Hearns' ribs. The conclusion swiftly arrived. Hearns was taking a horrible 
beating and had collapsed into the ropes when Pearl, with 1:45 left in the 
14th, waved Leonard off. 
</P>
<P>
"He took a lot of blows to the head," Pearl said later. "He couldn't defend 
himself. . . . If I think he's going to get seriously hurt, I'm going to stop 
it. He didn't argue when I stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
For Leonard, it was a great victory and an undisputed welterweight 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
For Hearns, it meant heartbreak. After 13 rounds, every judge had had him ahead 
on points, by margins of four, three and two points.

NEWSWIRE: JUDGE DELAYS RELEASE OF BRITISH EX-OLYMPIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed release of David Jenkins, the former British Olympian who has 
served six months of a seven-year sentence for selling black-market steroids to 
athletes, was delayed Friday by a federal judge in San Diego when the judge 
learned that the prosecutor had intercepted the judge's mail. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving demanded an explanation, calling the 
removal of a letter from his courthouse mailbox "shocking, unprofessional and 
intolerable to the court, with potentially serious consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's criticism was directed at Phillip Halpern, an assistant U.S. 
attorney who persuaded a court clerk to remove the letter written by Kenneth 
Ingleby, a U.S. Customs Service official who opposed reduction of Jenkins' 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also accused the prosecutor of "trading on the friendship" of clerk 
Chris Gibson, who received a thank-you note from Halpern. The note told Gibson 
she could throw away the letter because Ingleby had authorized the disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Halpern apologized to the court but insisted he was merely trying to prevent 
direct communication between an agency head and a judge, a communication which 
is illegal according to the U.S. Code on Procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, a U.S. resident, will remain in Boron Federal Prison in the Mojave 
Desert until Irving renders his decision.

MARYLAND INTERVIEWS USC'S RAVELING, WILL PICK NEW COACH IN NEXT 2 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling, USC basketball coach, has been interviewed for the University 
of Maryland coaching job. The school is seeking a replacement for Bob Wade, who 
resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
The interview, first reported in the Washington Post, was confirmed elsewhere 
Friday. Raveling wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling has two seasons remaining on a five-year contract he signed with USC 
in 1986. With the Trojans, Raveling has a 26-62 record, while finishing last in 
the Pacific 10 Conference three straight seasons. The Trojans were 10-22 in 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling was an assistant at Maryland for three years in the early 1970s under 
Coach Lefty Driesell, who was ousted in 1986 in the wake of the Len Bias 
situation. Bias, Maryland's star and the top draft choice of the Boston Celtics 
that year, died of a cocaine overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling left Maryland in 1972 for Washington State, where he became the first 
black head coach in the Pac-10. After compiling a 167-136 record in 11 seasons, 
he moved to Iowa, where he had a 54-38 record in three season before coming to 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams of Ohio State and Morgan Wooten of DeMatha High School in 
Hyattsville, Md., are considered the top candidates for the job. Others being 
considered are Jeff Mullins of North Carolina Charlotte, Ed Tapscott of 
American University and Bob Wenzel of Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland officials said they hope to name a new coach within two weeks.

Oakland Athletics slugger Jose Canseco, the American League's most valuable 
player in 1988, will plead no contest to gun charges and will get rid of the 
Jaguar linked to many of his recent troubles, according to one of his 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to fight the courts," Michael Stepanian said. "He's got the 
pennant to fight for." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was cited for driving the 1989 car at more than 125 m.p.h. on a Florida 
freeway and for running a red light in Phoenix. He is also accused of having 
illegally carried a loaded handgun on the floor of the car in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
A formal plea agreement in the gun case, which likely will include payment of a 
fine, is expected in a few weeks, Stepanian said.

JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE TRACK MEET; 
</P>
<P>
FOSTER, NEHEMIAH, KINGDOM HAVE HIGH HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"The Hurdlers," a long-running real life soap opera that was canceled for a 
while, will be renewed today in the McDonald's Jackie Joyner-Kersee track meet 
at Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar cast has been reassembled: Greg Foster, who is making a comeback 
from another broken arm; Renaldo (Skeets) Nehemiah, who has been on a perpetual 
comeback since his pro football days with the San Francisco 49ers ended in 
1986, and Roger Kingdom, the Olympic gold medalist, who has nothing to prove. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 30, and Nehemiah, 30, have been competing against one another since the 
late 1970s. They were not regarded as friendly rivals when Nehemiah was 
dominating the competition before he took a fling at pro football as a wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah is still the world record-holder in the 110-meter high hurdles at 
12.93 seconds, a standard that has endured since 1981. Moreover, his Drake 
Stadium record of 13 flat has remained in tact for a decade. It was a world 
record at the time. 
</P>
<P>
However, since leaving the 49ers and returning to track, he has not regained 
the style that made him virtually unbeatable. Injuries have frustrated him and, 
perhaps, the long layoff from a highly technical event and the physical 
pounding he absorbed in football may prevent him from ever regaining his 
world-class form. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Nehemiah is confident that he can be a factor again. 
</P>
<P>
In Nehemiah's absence, Foster flourished, becoming the world's top-ranked 
hurdler and winning at the World Championships in 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He was upset, though, by Kingdom in the 1984 Olympic Games at the Coliseum. 
Kingdom, now 26, subsequently had conditioning problems before asserting 
himself again to get his second gold medal last September at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Foster couldn't challenge him. He suffered a broken left arm July 4 while 
training for the U.S. Olympic trials and then courageously competed in the 
trials with his arm in a cast until he was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
He then broke the same arm again Jan. 31 while playing in a pickup basketball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I have two, 12-inch plates in my arm," said Foster. "And I notice it because 
it aches once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Foster says his goal is to regain his No. 1 world ranking in a most competitive 
event. Nehemiah is just striving for respectability again. 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah says he was an arrogant 22-year-old athlete when he left track for pro 
football, acknowledged as the greatest high hurdler of all time. Now, in a 
sense, he's competing against the image of his younger self and he ruefully 
said, "I'm not as graceful as I used to be. This body is different than the 
13-flat body." 
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah was encouraged when he recorded a time of 13.48 in August of 1986, but 
he suffered a torn Achilles' tendon and, in hindsight, said he returned to 
competition too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I started running with less than adequate physical ability," he said. "Even 
though I could run, it altered my technique drastically. I started experiencing 
some things I didn't know I could do, such as running sideways. That's been my 
biggest struggle the last year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
So Nehemiah's technique is flawed, contributing to his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm doing admirably well despite all my setbacks," he said. "I want so 
much to prove to myself and to everybody that I can make the comeback." 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's meet begins at noon and a world-class field has been assembled, 
including collegiate champion Dawn Sowell of LSU in the women's 100 meters; 
Larry Myricks, Mike Powell and Mike Conley in the long jump; Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee in the 100- and 400-meter hurdles; Andre Phillips and Danny 
Harris in the 400; Joe Falcon, Doug Padilla and Jeff Atkinson in the mile; 
Olympic gold medalist Louise Ritter in the high jump; silver medalist Randy 
Barnes in the shotput and Kory Tarpenning and Joe Dial in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster said he would be disappointed if the hurdlers don't run under 13.35 
seconds. Foster said he has been training harder than he ever has with 
over-distance work, adding that he was timed in 20.39 in a 200 in a training 
race in Provo, Utah. . . . Renaldo Nehemiah has five of the 10 fastest times in 
the 110-meter hurdles; Roger Kingdom has four.

TRIPLE TROUBLE;

<P>
SUNDAY SILENCE HASN'T GONE EASY ON TRAINER, GRAZING HIM WITH HOOF

<P>
The third time is supposed to be the charm for Sunday Silence today in the 
Belmont Stakes as the 3-year-old colt tries to become the 12th horse to win the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
But the three times that Sunday Silence has attacked his trainer, 76-year-old 
Charlie Whittingham, have been anything but charming. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham has been bitten on the back of the leg and on a finger by Sunday 
Silence, and Friday morning, the hyperactive colt reared in the air and grazed 
the trainer with a hoof to the right temple. 
</P>
<P>
"Another inch or two and it could have been much more serious than it was," 
said Richard Craigo, Whittingham's attorney, who was standing about 10 feet 
from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham was leading Sunday Silence from the paddock to the Belmont Park 
track for his customary morning gallop, with exercise rider Pam Mabes in the 
saddle. 
</P>
<P>
The horse left the tunnel and was just about ready to step onto the track, but 
before Whittingham could remove the lead shank, Sunday Silence reared high in 
the air and wheeled in the trainer's direction. Mabes was able to stay in the 
saddle. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse reared up so high, he looked like Roy Rogers' horse (Trigger)," 
Craigo said. "Charlie had to do some fancy footwork just to get out of the way 
as much as he did. He looked like a ballet dancer getting away." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham suffered a minor bruise and was treated at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham complained to friends about a sore jaw but said he had no headache. 
"I've never had a headache," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence was being trailed by an army of photographers, and Whittingham 
said that they may have spooked the colt. But other observers said that a 
nearby horse might have caused Sunday Silence to rear up. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham was more concerned about Sunday Silence than himself. "It's a good 
thing he's such a sound horse," he said. "I'm just glad he didn't hurt his 
foot. I thought I moved quick enough to get away from him, but he got me, 
anyway. These things happen."

GENE KLEIN GETTING OUT OF RACING;

<P>
WINNING COLORS WILL BE AMONG HORSES GOING ON BLOCK

<P>
Gene Klein, a three-time winner of the Eclipse Award as America's leading owner 
of thoroughbreds, announced Friday that he is pulling the plug on his 
multimillion-dollar racing stable after six years of meteoric success. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who formerly owned the San Diego Chargers, has decided to sell his 
nearly 150 race horses, broodmares, yearlings and weanlings at a public auction 
Nov. 6 in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Among those going on the block will be Winning Colors, 1988 Kentucky Derby 
winner; Lady's Secret, 1986 horse of the year, and current stable stars Open 
Mind and On the Line. 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors, who has not won since her Derby victory, is recuperating from a 
throat operation, and Lady's Secret, who already has been auctioned twice 
without selling, recently gave birth to a filly by Alydar. 
</P>
<P>
Klein's bombshell triggered speculation as to the impact it will have on Wayne 
Lukas, the country's top money-winning trainer. Lukas has guided Klein's racing 
dynasty since the two men met in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas has been cultivating other major clients during the last three years, 
among them Peter Brant, William T. Young and Daniel Wildenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas was en route from Oklahoma to Los Angeles Friday and could not be reached 
for comment. However, the fact remains that Klein's horses provided more than 
$23 million to the $64.7 million won by horses in the Lukas stable between 1984 
and 1988. In 1988 alone, Klein's horses won $5,632,639, nearly a third of 
Lukas' horses' $17,502,110 total. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said that he is getting out of racing because he no longer wants to 
commit the energy and attention required to maintain his unprecedented success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been thinking about cutting back on my horses for a long time," he said. 
"I thought at first that I could scale back, not be quite so involved. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not my style. I found out I couldn't lighten my load and still be 
competitive in the sport the way I wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
Not many owners have been able to compete with the Klein juggernaut, which has 
been fueled mainly by high-priced purchases of well-bred yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and his wife, Joyce, won their first race on Jan. 30, 1983, with a filly 
named Cassie's Prospect. Over the next six seasons their horses won 11 
championships, seven Breeders' Cup races, a Kentucky Derby, a Preakness and a 
horse-of-the-year title while flying Klein's blue and gold silks with the 
lightning bolt logo borrowed from the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said that the 1989 Breeders' Cup Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park in Florida -- 
two days before his dispersal sale -- would be his swan song. At least for now, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do it like Joe DiMaggio," Klein said. "I hope we can go out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, however, did not dismiss the possibility that he might reenter the sport 
later with a lower profile. In the meantime he will continue to lease Lukas the 
140-acre training center adjacent to his Del Rayo Farm near Klein's home in 
Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne and I will always be fast friends," Klein said. "I'm not worried about 
him at all. He's always turning people down who want to give him horses, so I'm 
sure they'll be lining up to fill my spot."

FATAL O.C. FIRE STARTED BY CHILD WITH A LIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON and CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A child playing with a cigarette lighter ignited the intense blaze that killed 
two infants and seriously injured another at a day-care home in Huntington 
Beach, fire officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While Pat Orozco was in the bathroom, one of four children in her care began 
playing with a disposable lighter in the living room, said Martha Werth, a 
public information officer for the Huntington Beach Fire Department. The 
lighter ignited an overstuffed chair, and the blaze spread quickly to an 
adjacent playroom. 
</P>
<P>
Both Orozco, 49, and Heidi Sartain, 25, a daughter who lives in the home, 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my lighter, and I'm a smoker," Sartain said. "It could have been my 
lighter, it could have been my mom's lighter, it could have been anybody's." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators speculated that if Orozco had installed smoke detectors in her 
home, "none of this would have happened," Werth said. "At worst, they would 
have gotten out with a few bumps and bruises." 
</P>
<P>
State fire officials said Friday that the tragedy has prompted them to review 
sometimes contradictory fire safety requirements regarding fire extinguishers 
and smoke detectors in day-care homes. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach fire officials also released new details of how the blaze 
started in the single-story, brown stucco house at 5122 Audrey Drive. Orozco 
ran from the bathroom at the front of the house through the kitchen and into 
the living room, where she grabbed 3-year-old Devon Strayer by the hand and 
lifted 8-month-old Jessica Jordan from a swing, Werth said. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco made her way into the playroom, but dropped Jessica near the doorway 
after her arm caught fire, Sartain said. Unable to find the baby in the thick 
smoke, Orozco picked up 6-month-old Nick Duncan and fled through a sliding door 
into the back yard. Despite rescue efforts by Orozco and several passers-by, 
Jessica and 13-month-old John W. Reilly IV died of smoke inhalation, Werth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Duncan baby remains hospitalized in serious but stable condition for burns 
to about 15% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
Because of laws that protect juveniles, Werth declined to identify which child 
is believed to have started the fire. However, on Thursday fire officials said 
Devon was the only child in the living room, which is where investigators 
determined that the blaze began. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco, who is hospitalized in fair condition with second- and third-degree 
burns to her upper body, was not available for comment Friday. Sartain said her 
mother remains distraught over the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Her main concern is that the families (of the victims) find peace," Sartain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state health and safety codes that govern licensing of day-care centers, 
operators with six or fewer children have the option of equipping their homes 
with fire extinguishers or smoke detectors, and an inspection by fire officials 
is not required. Orozco, who is licensed, opted for the fire extinguisher, 
which investigators think they have recovered in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
But state building codes, enforced by the state fire marshal, require that all 
day-care operators maintain both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors in 
their homes, said Galen Miller, a supervisor of field operations for the state 
fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials conceded that the tragedy might have been avoided had discrepancies 
in state licensing guidelines been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate these questions are being raised after this tragedy. They 
should have been answered before," Miller said. "I'm hoping an answer will come 
out of this, and, between the state fire marshal and the department of Social 
Services, we can agree on the proper application of regulations for these 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Frances Young, a supervisor in the Department of Social Service's 
community-care licensing division, said her office had been unaware of the 
inconsistency in state laws. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears obvious that something was missed, and I am going to instruct our 
policy people to take a look at this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Young said the less-stringent regulations would continue to be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not required to inform licensees of other regulations if they are not 
incorporated into our standards," she said. "There are all sorts of building 
codes and local ordinances; where would we draw the line?" 
</P>
<P>
The official, supervisor Steve Viero, said that because of the Huntington Beach 
fire, the state fire marshal's office will review existing fire safety 
regulations to determine if they are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime we have a scenario of this type, a review is in order," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that under existing guidelines Orozco cannot be faulted for 
installing only a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Edwards, director of adult and employment services for the Orange County 
Social Services Agency, said county officials have no authority to require 
regulations other than the less-stringent ones included in state health and 
safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that until regulations are amended, parents must determine for 
themselves if they are comfortable leaving their children in a home with no 
smoke detector. 
</P>
<P>
"All parents who make use of any family day-care center should ask if there is 
a smoke detector present if they feel that is the safest thing for their 
child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DAY-CARE LICENSING 
</P>
<P>
Family day-care licensing agencies provide the following services: 
</P>
<P>
Set standards that family day-care homes must meet. 
</P>
<P>
Process fingerprint checks on all adults in the home for existing criminal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Require tuberculosis tests of care givers. 
</P>
<P>
Investigate complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Visit each home upon receipt of a license application. 
</P>
<P>
Visit 10% of all licensed homes annually. 
</P>
<P>
Visit each home when licenses are renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Deny applications and revoke licenses when necessary. 
</P>

DAY-CARE SAFETY CHECKS 
</P>
<P>
Parents seeking a good child-care facility may check with one of the 65 
state-funded child-care referral centers in California. To contact the closest 
center, call the California Child Care Resource and Referral Network in San 
Francisco at (415) 661-1714. Also, parents should visit prospective day-care 
homes at various times during the day unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
Some safety checks parents can make themselves when visiting day-care homes: 
</P>
<P>
Pools must be surrounded by a fence at least five feet high with a 
self-latching gate. 
</P>
<P>
Homes caring for infants must not have stairways accessible to the children. 
</P>
<P>
Food preparation areas must be clean and the food must be properly stored in 
sealed containers or a refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Toxic chemicals for cleaning and medicines must be stored in a secured cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
There must be sufficient play areas for the number of children to be cared for 
in the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Homes should care for no more than six children unless the provider has an 
assistant (infant ratios are stricter). 
</P>
<P>
Homes should maintain a fire extinguisher or smoke alarm.

O.C. RESIDENTS FLEE VIOLENCE-TORN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Mission Viejo man flew into Los Angeles on Friday, grateful to a Chinese 
youth who warned him to leave Beijing's Tian An Men Square before troops moved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't leave now, the government will kill you unreasonably," the 
stranger told Douglas Hamilton, 28, as darkness fell upon the packed square a 
week ago today. "He was dead serious," said Hamilton, who recalled that the 
words were repeated twice. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, a civil engineer who had been teaching at Beijing's Chinese Ministry 
of Water Resources, was among the last Americans who heeded official warnings 
and got out of China as the mass violence in the square shocked the world. 
</P>
<P>
He and others who fled flew into Los Angeles International Airport on Friday 
and were greeted by anxious relatives. The arrivals included a young Tustin 
couple who stretched their Hawaiian honeymoon to China and found themselves in 
the square just before the shooting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that on the two-mile walk back to his hotel after the stranger's 
warning, he passed growing crowds of students trying to physically restrain 
columns of armed soldiers marching toward the square. 
</P>
<P>
"The students were saying, 'We are brothers, don't shoot Chinese,' " he said. 
"But the soldiers were from another province, spoke a different dialect and 
didn't seem to understand." 
</P>
<P>
Awakened by the crackle of gunfire in the distance at 1 a.m., Hamilton went 
outside to find the city's eastern horizon bathed in the orange light of fires. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, it was eerily quiet as he strode through streets covered 
with broken glass and the charred remains of smoldering vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people gathered around the body of a dead soldier . . . whose head 
had been crushed by I don't know what. The body was picked up two days later," 
he said, adding that for the next two days "I heard machine-gun fire every 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he escaped the pandemonium in town by paying a taxi driver "10 
times the normal fare to get to the airport." 
</P>
<P>
The honeymooners were Renee and Bob Lancaster, who were in Hawaii when they 
decided that adding a trip to China would, in the words of 29-year-old Renee, 
"open our eyes to what's going on in the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
They arrived in Beijing and spent Saturday in Tian An Men Square among hundreds 
of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators tensely awaiting the pending 
arrival of armed soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Renee got up on my shoulders to look over the heads of the crowd and look at 
the soldiers," said Bob Lancaster, 26, a contracts pricing manager at Camarco 
Inc. of Anaheim. "The crowd went wild. I guess she was a symbol of liberty to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
They awoke in their hotel Sunday morning to find city streets packed with 
soldiers, trucks and tanks. Sunday night, they boarded a 1950s-vintage Chinese 
propeller plane and continued their tour.

COUNTY MEDICAL ASSN. SEEKS TO SOLVE HOSPITAL TURN-AWAY CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Decrying the crisis over medical care for the poor, the Orange County Medical 
Assn. announced Friday that it will hold special meetings to try to solve the 
immediate problem of women in labor being turned away from overcrowded UCI 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a UCI problem. It is more than the poor obstetrical patients. This 
is a very real demonstration of the failure of the state government to be 
responsible for the care of the people in this state," association President 
Dr. Russell C. Ewing II said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a time to point fingers or to express astonishment at UCI's 
actions. The dam is broken. There is no place to run. We are all affected. The 
well-being, the very health of people, is at stake, and we must respond." 
</P>
<P>
The prepared statement said Ewing and the president of the county's society of 
obstetricians and gynecologists have called a special meeting with 
"professional representatives to address stemming the immediate problem." 
Afterward, the Orange County Medical Assn. will meet with county and state 
officials. "Accountability will be demanded," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing and other association officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a UCI Medical Center spokeswoman said Friday that 
Medi-Cal officials have rejected a plan to divert some of the overflow 
patients. UCI had asked to subcontract with AMI Medical Center of Garden Grove 
to handle up to 100 "low-risk deliveries" a month. The AMI hospital does not 
hold a contract with Medi-Cal to be reimbursed for treating indigent patients. 
UCI spokeswoman Susan Meister said hospital officials were notified of the 
decision Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Murray, executive director of the California Medical Assistance 
Program, which negotiates Medi-Cal contracts with hospitals for the state, said 
that request was turned down because the arrangement "was not in the best 
interest of the contracting program." 
</P>
<P>
He said UCI was asking to send patients to another hospital and yet collect 
more from Medi-Cal than UCI would pay the AMI hospital -- in effect, making a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
"Some would say that's selling medical patients," Murray said. "There are other 
means to solve the problem, and this would not solve it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said the arrangement was for the AMI hospital to handle only low-risk 
births, but since UCI handles so many patients with no prenatal care -- making 
them susceptible to complications -- there was "no guarantee" that the patients 
involved would not be high-risk. Further, he said, the proposed arrangement 
would have sent an average of four patients a day to the Garden Grove hospital, 
when UCI has had up to eight more obstetrical patients a day than it is 
licensed for. "So this is not a solution in and of itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But UCI's Meister countered that "any help would be welcome." 
</P>
<P>
If the Garden Grove hospital could take four patients a day, "that's all that's 
needed to get us out of a crisis. We're still willing to do more than our 
share, but we can't operate at this level with our staff and our space without 
creating a safety problem," Meister said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the agreement with the AMI hospital would have allowed the Garden 
Grove facility to transfer any high-risk patients to UCI. Further, Meister 
questioned Murray's contention that UCI would profit financially. 
</P>
<P>
She said UCI officials were told the commission turned down the subcontracting 
arrangement only because the agency did not want to set a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it more important to get this taken care of than to haggle over Medi-Cal 
rates? The key was to get people taken care of," Meister said. "It's a setback 
that only aggravates the situation, which is grave."

<P>
MAN CRITICALLY INJURED IN SHOVE FROM BALCONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man was in critical condition and on life-support systems at 
UCI Medical Center on Friday after being pushed off a third-story apartment 
balcony in Fullerton by a jealous husband, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jeff Roop said the victim, Francisco Jacinto Rivera, 31, was pushed off a 
balcony at an apartment complex in the 400 block of West Orangethorpe Avenue at 
6:40 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Roop identified the man who allegedly shoved Rivera off the balcony as John 
Richard Miranda, 32, who lives at the apartment complex with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda was booked into the Fullerton Jail on suspicion of attempted murder. 
His bail was set at $250,000, Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
Roop said the Mirandas had recently separated and during that time the wife, 
Diana May Miranda, was seeing Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
"The husband and wife got back together again, but Rivera came over to see her 
on Thursday, and an altercation broke out," Roop said. The fight culminated in 
Rivera's being shoved off the balcony, Roop said.

GIONIS FACES TRIAL WITH SUSPECT IN WAYNE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pomona surgeon Thomas A. Gionis will stand trial in the fall along with one of 
the men he allegedly directed to attack ex-wife Aissa Wayne in an attempt to 
gain custody of their daughter, according to two rulings in court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At his arraignment in Superior Court in Santa Ana, Gionis entered a plea of not 
guilty to charges that he masterminded the Oct. 3 attack. Judge Myron S. Brown 
set an Oct. 31 trial date. 
</P>
<P>
And at a separate hearing, Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald -- over the objections of 
defense attorney F. Lee Bailey -- decided that Gionis should be tried on 
assault charges along with Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, in custody on $1 million bail, is accused of helping carry out 
last fall's attack on Wayne and financier Roger W. Luby at Luby's Newport Beach 
home. He, too, pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans argued that Gionis and Hintergardt 
should be tried together for the sake of legal expediency. "We don't want to 
make the victims and the witnesses go through the same things many times," he 
said in an interview. "We want to do it one time." 
</P>
<P>
But co-defense attorney Allan H.Stokke of Santa Ana said after the judge's 
joint-trial ruling, "We think it's prejudicial that Dr. Gionis is to be tried 
together with a man he's never even met and had nothing to do with." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, however, played down the importance of the ruling, saying that he 
thought a joint trial would hurt Hintergardt more than it would Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
The nationally known defense attorney also said he is likely to ask that the 
trial be moved out of Orange County to allow his client to get a fair trial 
outside the glare of local publicity. 
</P>
<P>
A second man implicated in the execution of the Wayne-Luby attack, Jeffrey K. 
Bouey, 35, of Simi Valley, has agreed to cooperate with authorities and has not 
yet undergone a preliminary hearing on the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills private detective O. Daniel Gal, 32, whom Gionis allegedly paid 
to hire Hintergardt and Bouey and to coordinate the attack, remains in custody 
in Switzerland awaiting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a judge has agreed to reopen the custody dispute over 2-year-old 
Anastasia that prosecutors say triggered the attack on the daughter of film 
legend John Wayne. The child is in the temporary custody of Wayne, with Gionis 
maintaining monitored visitation rights.

LEFT PHOTOS OF HIMSELF;

<P>
MAN HELD IN BREAK-IN AT COSTA MESA SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An 18-year-old man was arrested Thursday on suspicion of burglary and resisting 
arrest after he allegedly broke into a Costa Mesa elementary school, painted 
swastikas on a blackboard and snapped photographs of himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Gregory Smith was arrested after children in a second-grade classroom at 
California Elementary School discovered Polaroid pictures that the suspect had 
apparently taken of himself during the vandalism attack last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Smith held a camera at arm's length and took pictures of his face 
and the top of his head, with the brightly colored classroom bulletin board in 
the background. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, Smith wore a black leather jacket, a black T-shirt, 
blue jeans and military boots, Costa Mesa Police Detective Bob Fate said. The 
suspect wore his strawberry blond hair in a 1/2-inch crew cut and it may have 
been colored. 
</P>
<P>
Fate said Smith was dressed as if he were a white-supremacist skinhead. But the 
detective added: "He's just a kid who is screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't claim he is a skinhead," Fate said. "He just seems to be going 
along with the program. . . . He may hang out with skinheads, but he is not a 
hothead, preaching white supremacy." 
</P>
<P>
Smith tried to flee from the arresting officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the classroom photos were copied and distributed to high schools in the 
Costa Mesa and Newport Beach area, Newport Beach school officials identified 
the suspect and alerted police, according to Scott Paulsen, California 
Elementary School principal. 
</P>
<P>
"In his brilliance, he took three pictures of himself and when he left he did 
not take them. . . . That's classic," Paulsen said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to painting the swastikas, Smith allegedly took about $40 and ate 
food in an earthquake preparedness kit. The cash was in small bills and change 
used to teach students how to count money. 
</P>
<P>
He is being held in Costa Mesa City Jail on $25,000 bail. His arrest record 
gives no address and lists him as a transient. However, Fate said he had seen 
Smith before in Costa Mesa.

2 NAMES MENTIONED FOR TOLLWAY POST; 
</P>
<P>
MEYER RESIGNATION BRINGS TALK OF IRVINE OFFICIAL, COUNTY PLANNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the search for a new county tollway chief has not yet officially 
begun, at least two names of possible replacements have surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The post is open in the wake of the resignation Thursday of John Meyer, who 
cited "burnout," complaints from developers and a desire to return to 
mass-transit planning. Meyer, who in a letter prepared for delivery to an 
industry newsletter has taken a parting shot at the Mission Viejo Co., is 
executive director of the San Joaquin Hills and Foothill/Eastern Transportation 
Corridor Agencies. The agencies oversee three planned tollway projects in 
southern and eastern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Potential successors being discussed Friday include Irvine City Manager William 
Woollett and county transportation planner Lisa Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Woollett said he is "very interested" in the job but has not made a decision to 
apply. Mills, who is director of planning and programs at the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A six-man committee was formed to find Meyer's successor, but it has not yet 
scheduled a meeting. Applications are to be submitted within 30 days and must 
be addressed to the clerk of the transportation corridor agencies, Meyer said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tollway board members said that Woollett's name came up informally because of 
his role on several city-county committees that are studying growth and 
transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said Woollett would make a fine tollway director: "He has just the right 
temperament for the job." 
</P>
<P>
But Woollett also is being touted for another post -- that of executive 
director of a proposed Orange County Assn. of Governments, a planning 
organization that would merge the county's transportation and transit agencies 
into one body ruled by a panel of city council members and county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm even more interested in the COG (association of governments) idea," 
Woollett said, "but the legislation for that isn't final yet and I was planning 
not to have to make a decision until the end of July. If the corridor agencies 
have a 30-day deadline, I don't know what I'll do." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Goodman, an aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, said that some tollway 
board members may reconsider their previous opposition to joining the new 
combined transportation-transit agency, in part because the tollway effort is 
understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
But San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, chairman of the 
Foothill/Eastern tollway board, said he remains strongly committed to keeping 
the tollway projects separate, at least until bonds are sold to help finance 
them and they are actually built. 
</P>
<P>
Mills' name surfaced because she was instrumental in securing a commitment from 
the state for $35 million in tollway financing last year. Transportation 
Commission officials said they have urged Mills to consider applying for the 
tollway job but added that they did not know what her plans are. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans official Carolyn Ewing was also rumored to be considering an 
application, but she, too, was unavailable for comment. Ewing is a former Yorba 
Linda councilwoman who once served as an aide to Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
Former County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, a member of the California 
Transportation Commission and a founding member of the tollway agencies, took 
his name out of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances would I take that job," said Nestande, who has been 
critical of the agencies' performance thus far. "They need a very strong 
manager, someone who can get roads built." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, who has cited criticism from the Mission Viejo Co., among other 
developers, as a partial reason for his resignation, lashed out at the firm in 
comments contained in a draft letter to an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter recently quoted a Mission Viejo Co. vice president who blamed 
the tollway agencies for delays in building the San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
In his draft letter, Meyer cited the need for completion of tollway 
environmental impact reports. The Mission Viejo Co. has suggested that the 
reports are unnecessary, at least for a four-mile stretch of road that the 
company wants to build now. This two-lane road eventually would become part of 
the tollway between El Toro and La Paz roads in the new planned community of 
Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's draft letter recalls that the Mission Viejo Co. engaged in "premature 
grading" that it was forced to stop in the tollway area. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co.'s error nearly resulted in a loss of federal funds for 
the San Juaquin Hills Transportation Corridor," Meyer wrote. "This kind of 
foolhardy, precipitous activity is an example of Mission Viejo Co.'s lack of 
judgment in this matter. In fact, this risky behavior endangered the entire 
project." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also criticizes the Mission Viejo Co.'s claims, made in public statements 
and full-page newspaper ads, that it is going to build four miles of the San 
Joaquin Hills tollway at a cost of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
No financing agreement exists for that construction.

GIBSON SHOUTS, BUT DODGERS ARE NO MATCH FOR REDS' RIJO, 4-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Batting .229 for the season and having hit .201 on the recent trip, the Dodgers 
were heard from only verbally Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson, reacting to a called strikeout in the first inning of his team's 
home-stand opener against the Cincinnati Reds, was ejected by plate umpire Joe 
West for disparaging remarks after returning to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there were only sounds of silence again from the Dodgers' attack. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rijo, pitching the first complete-game shutout of his career, allowed only 
five singles as the Reds won for the eighth time in their last 10 games, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
A solo home run by 39-year-old veteran Ken Griffey in the fourth, his third 
homer of the season, and a three-run home run by reserve second baseman Lenny 
Harris, the first homer of his career, in the sixth left Orel Hershiser with 
his fifth loss in 12 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching for the first time since he went seven innings in relief in the 
22-inning marathon at Houston Saturday night/Sunday morning, Hershiser allowed 
nine hits and four runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo was better, but then he was pitching against the National League's weakest 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,912 saw the Reds' 24-year-old right-hander strike 
out five and walk only one in improving his record to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The first-place Reds have now won 11 of his 13 starts, and this one put them 10 
games over .500 with a six-game lead over the Dodgers in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Pete Rose, his own future in doubt because of Commissioner Bart 
Giamatti's investigation into his alleged gambling activities, is making no 
predictions about his team's future. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see anyone running off with it," he said of the race in the West. "I'd 
like for us to, but it's a tall order because we're talking about the strongest 
and most well-balanced division in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we could have lost tonight and dropped to third, and that's the way 
it's going to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're on a pace to win 93 games. I'd rather win 98, but I'll take 
the 93." 
</P>
<P>
Of victory No. 34, Rose reflected on the ejection of Gibson and the early 
departure of Hershiser and said, "We got rid of about $4 million in salaries in 
six innings and that helped." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson objected to both the called second and called third strikes and drew a 
$100 fine from West when he flung his bat leaving the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't ejected until he reached the dugout, when West claimed that Gibson 
yelled an obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my job to stay in the game," Gibson said. "It wasn't good that I got 
ejected, I realize that. But in my judgement, what was said didn't merit 
ejection. But then my judgement doesn't count, of course." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda suggested that West was looking to eject Gibson by 
continuing to eye him as he walked into the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"The umpire followed him all the way," Lasorda said. "I thought the object was 
to keep players in the game. The fans pay to see them. He deserved to be fined, 
but to be thrown out..." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda didn't finish his thought, nor did Hershiser finish what he started, 
his earned-run average rising from 2.38 to 2.61. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw two bad fastballs," he said of the home run pitches. "Otherwise I 
thought I pitched well." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds left two runners on base in the first inning and three more in the 
third. Griffey homered to open the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Griff has been hitting good," Rose said. "Throw it down and in and he can 
still hit it out anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
There were two on and two out in the sixth when Harris connected on the first 
pitch. Did he consider walking the No. 2 hitter with Rijo on deck? 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to throw a sinker away," Hershiser said. "I knew Rijo was behind 
him, but I made a bad pitch mechanically, a human mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, batting .222, drilled it into the right field pavilion above the 370 
foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny has strength," Rose said of his backup second baseman. "Throw it in his 
wheelhouse and you can see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall, placed on the 21-day disabled list during the Dodgers' recent 
trip, said he is still having good days and bad days in a therapy process 
designed to strengthen his stomach and back muscles, relieving the chronic 
soreness in his lower back. "I really haven't been in form or able to help the 
club since I hurt it again in the World Series," Marshall said, adding there is 
no timetable for his return. . . . "I feel I had no alternative but to give an 
honest shot at getting healthy," he said. "Taking three weeks now was worth the 
investment. I'll still have 80 or 90 games left. I'll still be looking to make 
an impact. I consider myself an impact player who can carry a club for three or 
four weeks at a time, but the way I was swinging and playing, I just couldn't 
do that. I mean, there comes a time when you lose your mechanics, you lose your 
confidence and you're hurting the team. I didn't want to let it go until August 
and still be mediocre." . . . Marshall went on the disabled list with four home 
runs and 13 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor said a terse "OK" when asked how his arm felt in the wake of his 
first rehabilitation appearance since his October elbow surgery. Tudor gave up 
one hit and walked none in pitching five innings for Vero Beach against Winter 
Haven of the Florida State League Wednesday night at Vero Beach. Pitching 
instructor Sandy Koufax told Florida Today, "He threw as well as I've seen him 
throw since he's been with us." Tudor is likely to make his next appearance at 
Bakersfield, but no date has been set, Executive Vice President Fred Claire 
said. . . . Ray Searage, on the 15-day disabled list for back spasms, played 
catch for the first time Friday and said he would have a better idea about his 
status when he sees how the back responds to the added activity. . . . Mickey 
Hatcher, on the 15-day disabled list for a groin strain, said he has curtailed 
his therapy since receiving a cortisone injection but was hopeful of coming off 
the DL as soon as eligible.

BO THROWS THE BOOK AT ANGELS; ROYALS HAND MCCASKILL 2ND LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He hit a ball in Arlington, Tex., that nearly touched down in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
He threw out Seattle's Harold Reynolds from the warning track on the fly, 
turning a certain sacrifice fly into a Kansas City Royals' legend. 
</P>
<P>
He bounced routine grounders to shortstop and wound up stomping on first base, 
waiting on the throw. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if Bo Jackson can learn to pull the ball, he just might be a player. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Angels and their American League earned-run average leader, 
Kirk McCaskill, ran into Bo, the man and the myth, and ended up contributing 
another chapter. Bo Jackson -- Raider running back, Royal left fielder and, 
now, the world's strongest spray hitter -- turned on an outside slider by 
McCaskill and turned it into an opposite-field, three-run home run that powered 
Kansas City to a 6-1 victory over the Angels at Royals Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It came on a pitch that used to leave Jackson flailing -- low and away. It came 
on a pitch that, according to McCaskill, "98% of the guys don't hit out." 
</P>
<P>
It landed high up in the seats beyond the right-field foul pole, Jackson's 14th 
home run of the season and his seventh to the opposite field. 
</P>
<P>
There once was a book on how to pitch Jackson. As recently as 1988, it 
suggested working him outside and enticing him to lunge at the ball, thus 
neutralizing much of his strength. 
</P>
<P>
Soon to commence are book burnings all across the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody has to continually change their book on Bo," Angel Manager 
Doug Rader said, "because he keeps making quick adjustments. What the book said 
a year ago does not necessarily hold true now." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Rader says, is that Jackson, as a hitter of major league pitches, 
is still growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"To say there's a pitch that gave him a problem is unfair," Rader said. "He's 
still so much in a developmental stage. He's just starting to understand the 
art of hitting." 
</P>
<P>
But, he's learning, he's learning. 
</P>
<P>
In successive at-bats against Angel pitching, Jackson crushed opposite-field 
home runs. Last Sunday, wily veteran Bert Blyleven tried to sneak a change-up 
by Jackson in the ninth inning. It cost him a shutout. Friday night, with two 
runners on base in the first inning, McCaskill tried to bait Jackson on the 
outside edge of the plate. It turned a 1-0 Angel lead into a 3-1 Royal 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a pretty good slider," McCaskill said. "I'd thrown him one 
early in the count and he didn't look good on it. So I thought I'd throw him 
another." 
</P>
<P>
You might say Bo adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was out," McCaskill said, "but he's so strong. Once it got 
over the infield, it took off like a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the guy's an amazing athlete. No doubt about it. There are certain 
guys in this league who can outplay the dimensions of any ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill never really recovered from the home run. In the second inning, he 
served up a two-run single to Kurt Stillwell and in the fourth, a double to 
Brad Wellman and another single to Stillwell amounted to a sixth Royal run. 
After walking Kevin Seitzer, McCaskill found himself out of the game, his 3 
2/3-inning stint being his shortest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, McCaskill (7-2) lost for the first time since April 23 and 
watched his ERA leap from 1.69 to 2.27, establishing teammate Chuck Finley 
(1.88) as the new league leader. 
</P>
<P>
He also made a winner of Kansas City starter Charlie Leibrandt for only the 
second time since April 28. Leibrandt (4-6) limited the Angels to six hits in 
nine innings -- and no runs after the first, when Brian Downing doubled and 
scored his team's run on a ground-out by Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
Ray also hit a ball that died on the warning track in the sixth inning and Bill 
Schroeder, in the fourth, drove one to the left field wall that Jackson 
intercepted with a leaping catch. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the real difference tonight," Rader said. "Bo hit one out and we had 
two that didn't get out. We're five feet short on a couple and they had a 
little excess." 
</P>
<P>
On a pitch Jackson didn't used to be able to hit. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been pitching me that way this year," Jackson said. "They're trying to 
get me chasing a ball way out there. They're throwing the same pitch out on the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not complaining. Luckily, I've been getting most of them." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson then turned modest, conceding that "the ball was carrying well tonight. 
If we were playing in (the Angels') ballpark, they would've hit at least five 
balls out." 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't in this ballpark, on this night. Jackson's did. And for that, 
Kansas City Manager John Wathan said, there is a reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo's ball (tonight) is going to carry anywhere, at any time, at any 
temperature," Wathan said. "It's just strength. He can hit a ball out of any 
part of the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
No one is safe. And just wait until he starts pulling the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill didn't catch Bo Jackson's home run in its entirety. His eyes 
were attracted instead to the back of his right fielder, Claudell Washington. 
"First I saw WASH," McCaskill said, smiling. "Then ING. Then TON. That told me 
the ball was hit pretty good." . . . . McCaskill walked four in 3 2/3 innings, 
suggesting that the location of his pitches was lacking, but Angel Manager Doug 
Rader waved that suggestion off. "A lot of times, 'location' is a catch-all," 
Rader said. "That's like saying, 'It's a virus.' Location goes a little bit 
farther than that. (McCaskill) just overthrew early. When that happens, there's 
not a whole lot you can do about it. You just hope a guy having the kind of 
season he's having will show some patience and adjust. It just didn't come 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Moving a step closer to full strength again, the Royals announced that they 
will re-activate George Brett from the disabled list before tonight's game. 
Brett, sidelined since April 29 because of a torn knee ligament, tested the 
knee on the Cybex strength machine Friday and was cleared to play by the 
Royals' medical staff. Kansas City Manager John Wathan said that he will break 
Brett in slowly, however, using him primarily as a designated hitter during the 
next two weeks. The Royals were 20-16 in the 36 games they played without 
Brett. . . . Other Kansas City roster moves: The Royals also recalled infielder 
Bill Pecota from triple-A Omaha, outrighted pitchers Stan Clarke and Rick 
Luecken to Omaha, placed outfielder Gary Thurman (wrist) on the disabled list 
and acquired pitcher Terry Leach in a trade with the New York Mets. Leach, a 
right-hander, was 0-0 with a 4.22 earned-run average in 10 games with the Mets, 
who will receive a minor league player to be named later in the deal. Pecota 
was batting .245 with 19 RBIs in 41 games with Omaha.

Tackle Darren Gilbert, a former Cal State Fullerton player, has been 
hospitalized because of a lung infection, the New Orleans Saints said. Doctors 
at Ochsner Foundation Hospitals in New Orleans have not said when Gilbert will 
be released, and he may remain hospitalized through the weekend, a spokesman 
said. Gilbert was the Saints' No. 2 draft choice in 1985.

MIRACLE IN MIAMI; 
</P>
<P>
LONGO GARCIA MAKES HIS LAST-CHANCE PITCH IN MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Miami, there are miracles and then there are the Miracles. Longo Garcia 
pitches for the latter and hopes for the former. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was a washout with the Class-A Clinton Giants last summer. These days, 
he spends his time pitching for the Miami Miracles, a Class-A team in the 
Florida State League, trying to catch someone's eye . . . maybe that of a 
scout. Or even a friend of a scout. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is the most important thing in my life," Garcia said. "I have to look 
at it that way if I'm going to make it. And I really want to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Miami might be the last chance for Garcia, who played at Cal State Fullerton, 
and the Miracles are not quite the center of the baseball world. They are not 
affiliated with a major league team and about half the team is made up of free 
agents no one else wanted. 
</P>
<P>
They do have a couple of high-profile owners in comedian Bill Murray and singer 
Jimmy Buffett, neither of whom have ever been known for their baseball skills. 
But, then, neither are the Miracles. 
</P>
<P>
Miami is in last place in the Eastern Division with a 14-48 record. The team 
also ranks last in hitting and pitching, not the best of combinations. 
</P>
<P>
But, it's a nice gig for a guy who's trying to prove his worth or show that an 
organization sold him short. Or both. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it's working for Garcia, who was released by the San Francisco Giants 
on March 20, but has pitched well since joining the Miracles. His record is 
only 2-3, but he has a 2.96 earned-run average and has struck out 56 batters in 
70 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But is anybody watching? 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that some teams are looking at me," Garcia said. "I'm trying not to 
pay attention to that. I'm just happy to be here." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami organization, in its first year, isn't exactly organized. At times, 
anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For starters, there's Murray and Buffett, who are part of an investment 
group that owns the team. Both made appearances at the team's season opener and 
Murray even threw a party in the left-field corner after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miracle Manager Jim Gattis recently missed a trip so he could fly to 
California to take care of his floral business. He returned Wednesday after two 
weeks of arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During a recent trip, office personnel thought the team was staying in 
Tampa while playing in Port Charlotte, a mere 80 miles away. The team actually 
was staying in Port Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get started until really late," said Keith Kaub, a first baseman 
in the Montreal Expos organization who spent two weeks playing for the 
Miracles. "They only had about four or five weeks to get ready. They're doing 
it on a whim." 
</P>
<P>
The territorial rights for Miami were bought by a group of investors -- which 
included Murray and Buffett -- in late February. Gattis, who spent four years 
as an assistant at Pepperdine, was hired in early March. 
</P>
<P>
"I resigned at Pepperdine last year and was seeking a head coaching job," 
Gattis said. "I was one of the finalists for the (Cal State) Northridge 
position. When I didn't get it, I figured I would concentrate on my floral 
business. When the Miami people called, I was surprised, but I accepted." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Miracles had a manager, but not a team. 
</P>
<P>
The franchise reached agreements with the Expos, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland 
Indians and Detroit Tigers for a number of players, who are still under 
contract with those clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Kaub, for instance, was 20 pounds overweight and officials in Montreal believed 
he would shed it quicker in the Miami heat. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the team is made up of free agents who were released. Those players 
were of unknown quality. They had been released, after all. 
</P>
<P>
That worked to Garcia's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Gattis had no idea what talent, if any, he had to work with. He was especially 
concerned about his pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't seen any of them throw," Gattis said. "The season was starting in 
five weeks and I had no one I felt really comfortable with to start the 
opener." 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Garcia was handed his walking papers by the Giants. When 
Gattis heard "through the baseball grapevine" that the scrawny, junk-ball 
pitcher was available, he called a Fullerton-based scout for Garcia's number. 
</P>
<P>
Gattis had seen the 5-foot-11, 170-pound Garcia pitch before. In fact, Gattis 
remembered him all too well. Garcia had shut out Pepperdine, 2-0, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered he had great command of all his pitches," Gattis said. "I also 
remembered he was a fierce competitor and that really impressed me." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia already had received an offer from the Reno Silver Sox, a Class-A 
independent team in the California League. The Silver Sox wanted him to fly to 
Reno for a tryout. Gattis' offer was a little more substantial. He wanted 
Garcia to come to Miami and be the Miracles' opening-day pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a tough decision. 
</P>
<P>
Longo was long gone for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to fly to Reno the day Coach Gattis called," Garcia said. "I 
immediately changed my plans and flew to Miami. Playing for someone who has 
seen you pitch is important. You don't have to prove yourself and you don't 
have to worry about every bad outing." 
</P>
<P>
Warming up in the bullpen for his opening-day start, Garcia was nervous. 
Nothing new about that, though. It's part of his pregame routine. 
</P>
<P>
"Longo is just weird, he always gets nervous before he pitches," said Kaub, who 
played with Garcia at Fullerton last season. "I think it's almost a ritual for 
him. Like, whenever he was pitching, he would have to catch one fly ball during 
batting practice. He would show up early, catch a fly in the outfield, then go 
sit down in the dugout. It's just Longo." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gattis had never experienced Garcia's unusual pregame mood. What he 
saw was a pitcher on verge of a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was so hyped up, I thought he was going to get sick," Gattis said. "I 
needed something that would take the edge off him a little." 
</P>
<P>
So Gattis sent for professional help. 
</P>
<P>
Since Murray was in attendance for the opening-day ceremonies, Gattis decided 
to put the part-owner to work. He ask him to go talk to Garcia in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"My stomach was hurting and I couldn't get the ball over for strikes," Garcia 
said. "Bill Murray came over and started talking to me. He was telling me jokes 
and complaining about all the photographers. He was really funny. I started 
laughing and it helped calm me down." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia pitched a three-hitter and struck out 11 in a 5-0 victory over Fort 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who knew Longo was Coach Gattis and myself," Kaub said. "Longo 
is not very big and he doesn't throw very hard. So when he was warming up, some 
of our guys were worried. A couple of them were saying, 'Oh my God, that's our 
pitcher?' 
</P>
<P>
"Once he got into the game, everyone was more impressed. I think he shocked the 
Ft. Lauderdale players. I remember one guy that Longo struck out three times. 
The last time up, it seemed like the guy didn't even want to hit. He just 
looked at three strikes and walked back to the dugout." 
</P>
<P>
In his second start, Garcia allowed only one run in nine innings in a 
no-decision against Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy has really good stuff," pitching coach Dave Taylor said. "I have no 
idea why the Giants gave up on him." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also wonders why San Francisco sent him packing. However, he didn't wait 
for an answer when he was informed by the Giants that he was released. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of blew up at the guy who told me," Garcia said. "I didn't give him a 
chance to give me an excuse. I couldn't believe it, they didn't even give me 
chance to pitch a full season." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was drafted by the Giants in the 25th round after a strong senior season 
at Fullerton. He was 8-5 during the regular season and won two postseason 
games, including a 9-3 victory over Miami of Florida in the first round of the 
College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But, Garcia didn't sign with the Giants until a month after the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Longo thought he could hold out for big money, but we didn't feel he was worth 
a big investment," said Dave Nahabedian, assistant director of minor league 
operations for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Said Garcia: "What the originally offered me was a slap in the face. We were 
about $4,000 apart. They also wanted to send me to rookie ball, but I felt I 
should play on a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
It took a nearly month for a compromise to be hammered out. Garcia signed and 
was sent to Clinton, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The long layoff took its toll. Garcia had trouble throwing strikes, walking 19 
in 29 2/3 innings. And when he did manage to get the ball over the plate, he 
didn't fool anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia pitched well in his first outing, but was hit hard in the next three 
starts. He was banished to the bullpen and finished with a 1-2 record and a 
5.49 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
During spring training, the Giants had seen enough to know Garcia didn't fit 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pitching strong all through the organization and Longo just didn't have 
the ability," Nahabedian said. "We thought he would be a good pitcher, 
especially on one of our lower levels. But he struggled at Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that part of the problem was Clinton itself. He wasn't too fond of 
the the place. 
</P>
<P>
Located in central Iowa, Clinton was different than anything Garcia experienced 
growing up in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either," Garcia said. "It's a dead 
town. The only good-looking girl I saw in the whole town was at a fast food 
place. And I think she was passing through with her father. It was boring, all 
we did was play baseball and watch MTV." 
</P>
<P>
Things have been a little more exciting in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"We standing around on the field before the opener and all sudden Bill Murray 
walks up to us," Kaub said. "He looks around and then says, 'So, are we any 
good?' Then he starts rattling off one-liners. He was just like he is on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Murray's postgame party was a catered affair, with champagne and a live band. 
Besides the team, the guest list included Buffett, Ahmad Rashad and Murray's 
brother, Brian-Doyle Murray. At one point, Murray went on stage to sing with 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
"He did 'Wild Thing' and it was hilarious," Garcia said. "I couldn't stop 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kaub: "It was like nothing I've ever seen. It was like 'Saturday Night 
Live,' only better. Murray was telling jokes that they wouldn't let you do on 
TV. I wish I had a video camera with me." 
</P>
<P>
The following week, the Miracles played a three-game series in Key West, where 
Buffett lives, and drew sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we were the attraction, they were there to see Jimmy," said 
Kaub, who currently plays for Rockford in the Midwest League. "But it was a lot 
of fun playing for that organization. There were a lot of exciting things 
happening while I was there. I miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also has enjoyed the fun and games. But his goal from the start was to 
catch on with a major league organization and get one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blind, I know the team isn't all that great," Garcia said. "But I'm 
holding my own on the mound. Maybe some scout will see that and say, 'This guy 
can play.' I came here for a purpose. I've already proved that the Giants were 
wrong. I can still pitch." 
</P>
<P>
And, to Garcia, that's no miracle.

IMPORTERS AND BUYERS HAIL RISE IN DOLLAR; 
</P>
<P>
SOME O.C. BUSINESSES POST FAST PRICE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It was Memorial Day when the young merchant banker wandered into Dansk Mobel 
Export Inc. in Los Angeles and made a very big impression. As a specialist in 
European currencies, he knew the time was ripe to buy Danish imports -- to buy 
nearly anything, as a matter of fact, that was shipped here from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
And buy he did -- $62,000 worth. Exorbitant, you say? Perhaps, but a bargain 
nonetheless. For had he made the same purchases 18 months ago, they would have 
cost him nearly $15,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been watching the rate, and he decided that this is the time to buy," 
said David Sakol, Dansk president. "We've watched our prices come down. Our 
prices have dropped 19% since November, 1987." 
</P>
<P>
For the last six months, the once-weak dollar has surprised economists with a 
steady gain in strength. Last Dec. 31, for example, it was worth 123.61 yen; by 
May 31, it had risen to 137.86. And the stronger the dollar, of course, the 
more it buys. 
</P>
<P>
It continued its months-long surge Friday, gaining sharply against the British 
pound, the yen, the French franc and the Deutsche mark, among other foreign 
currencies. While such strength makes many economists edgy, importers are 
ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
For it wasn't too long ago that dollar doldrums made doing business overseas 
expensive at best. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Shedd, co-owner of Steven-Thomas Antiques in Santa Ana, keeps a running 
tab on the dollar's fluctuations on a personal computer in his office. His 
20-year-old store specializes in European antiques, and Shedd said he has 
realized a savings of 5 to 15% in the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
And he has passed on that bounty to his customers. Steven-Thomas Antiques 
heralded its recent semiannual sale with a flyer that gushed: "Due to the 
recent increased strength of the dollar, the savings will be even greater!" 
</P>
<P>
Shedd lists a 1920s-era burl walnut china cabinet with beveled glass for $995. 
The storewide sale reduced the price to $689. Eighteen months ago, when the 
dollar was far weaker against the lira, the cabinet from northern Italy would 
have been priced at $1,195, Shedd said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we price, it depends on the availability of a product at a particular 
moment, what we paid for the item and, recently, the favorable fluctuation in 
the dollar," Shedd said. "It has allowed us 5% to 15% leeway to mark products 
down." 
</P>
<P>
But not all firms are so quick to respond to the dollar's fluctuations. The 
larger the company, the less flexible it generally is in responding to changes 
in the marketplace. And those firms that keep large inventories and order far 
in advance also react more sluggishly. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't respond to the movement of the French franc or other currency as much 
as others," said a spokeswoman for Trader Joe's Co. in South Pasadena. "We buy 
well ahead. And we don't wait for the dollar to change." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Moreno, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, says 
that it usually takes at least a year for savings caused by the strengthening 
dollar to be passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the exchange rate changes today, we will see an adjustment in import prices 
in about a year," Moreno said. "The big surprise in the '80s has been that 
apparently import prices haven't moved very much -- or as much as we expected 
-- in response to changes in the exchange rate. . . . These days, it may be as 
many as two years before you see the effect." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose fairly steadily from 1980 to the first quarter of 1985, Moreno 
said. It started a precipitous slide in 1987, the same year the so-called Group 
of Seven industrial nations intervened to stabilize the dollar. The dollar 
fluctuated through most of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Since January, it's been appreciating," Moreno said. "That's the big story of 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Quackenbush, is the owner of Shamrock Imports, a beer and wine importer in 
Signal Hill. Shamrock has been in business for only three years, and during 
most of that time, the dollar worked against him. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the dollar was behaving made prices go sky-high and drove a lot of 
people out of the business," Quackenbush said. "You got to wondering, 'Am I 
even going to have a business?' Things were so expensive." 
</P>
<P>
But Quackenbush now says he is "right on the borderline," poised to lower the 
wholesale prices for his European brews. And soon, he posits, those savings 
will be passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"In beer," he says, "that will be really big for us, make us competitive. 
Especially with the German beers, which just aren't competitive now." 
</P>
<P>
Bitburger, Germany's No. 1 selling beer, now costs $4.37 per six-pack 
wholesale, $5.99 retail. Come July, Quackenbush says, he'll be lowering his 
Bitburger prices between 8% and 10%, to $3.87 wholesale and $5.49 retail. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is the Deutsche mark. On Friday, the dollar was worth 2.0025 
Deutsche marks, up from 1.9770 on Thursday and 1.7563 last Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
In the imported-tile industry, says Edward Ghodsian, president of Los 
Angeles-based Emser International, business is so competitive that he has to 
pass on to his customers the savings he realizes from the stronger dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Ghodsian keeps a running chart of the changing dollar on his office wall; it 
chronicles a 7% drop in the lira and a 5% drop in the yen in the last month. 
When he revises his wholesale price lists in the next two weeks, they will 
reflect the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite savings to the consumer, no doubt, right now," Ghodsian 
said. "This is a fantastic sign, really. When the dollar is stronger, it means 
the economy is doing well. It's good for everybody, really."

HOME PRICES RETREAT IN ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
INCREASED SALES OF LESS-EXPENSIVE HOUSES BRING DOWN AVERAGE COST 0.8% IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County home prices dropped slightly in May, according to TRW Real Estate 
Market Information, which said the drop was actually evidence that the housing 
market became a little stronger during the month. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a home in May was $236,375, down 0.8% from April's 
$238,353. Despite the drop, the May average was still 23.3% higher than a year 
ago, when the price was $191,691. 
</P>
<P>
(TRW counts both new and used condominiums and houses in its monthly survey of 
land transactions.) 
</P>
<P>
There were more buyers in the market in May, said John Karevoll of TRW. Earlier 
this year, rising interest rates forced less-affluent buyers out of the market, 
and less expensive houses weren't selling too well. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the average price of the homes sold in the county rose each month, 
even though sales weren't as strong as last year. With only expensive homes 
selling, the average price rose each month. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Karevoll, with interest rates going down again, less expensive houses 
are selling and the average price is declining slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"People who were kicked out of the market because of rising mortgage rates are 
coming back, and that's why the average price declined in May," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, TRW said, the market is a lot slower than this time last year, when home 
sales took off and stayed hot through much of the rest of 1988. Part of the 
reason is that prices have climbed so high that far fewer residents can afford 
a home in the county. 
</P>
<P>
While home sales rose 5.7% from April to May, from 3,693 to 3,903, sales were 
way down from last May's 5,610 homes sold. That was a whopping 30.4% drop, said 
TRW. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is definitely a little softer," said Karevoll. "A lot of Orange 
County buyers are being bumped out to Riverside County by the high prices." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County home sales through May, for example, jumped 34.7% compared to 
last year. In Orange County, they slumped 20.3%, said Karevoll.

ALMANAC / BUSINESS FINANCES: MONEY-MANAGING NEEDS CHANGE WITH GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Money is not only the mother's milk of politics, as the late state Treasurer 
Jesse M. Unruh once said, it is the lifeblood of small business. And while 
every company has its own needs and characteristics, there are some rules of 
thumb for money management that most follow. Kevin Sayer, a manager at the 
Newport Beach office of the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney, and Ralph 
Sabin, a partner with the firm as well as head of its emerging-business 
practice, recently outlined for The Times the three basic stages of a company's 
growth -- and suggested the goals that a company's treasurer should aim for in 
managing the finances through each stage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHASE ONE: EARLY DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
<P>
In the early development stage, spend money on product development and 
marketing and distribution. Keep administrative costs at a minimum. Production 
costs will be high and profit margins slim because volume is low. The goal: 
operate lean and don't lose too much money. 
</P>
<P>
Assets 
</P>
<P>
Property, Plant and Equipment 25% 
</P>
<P>
Cash 15% 
</P>
<P>
Accounts 
</P>
<P>
Receivable 25% 
</P>
<P>
Inventory 35% 
</P>
<P>
Liabilities &amp; Equity 
</P>
<P>
Equity 40% 
</P>
<P>
Long-Term 
</P>
<P>
Financing 10% 
</P>
<P>
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 50% 
</P>
<P>
CHARACTERISTICS: 
</P>
<P>
Cash is a big slice of the pie at this stage because a hefty reserve is needed 
to cover the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
Inventory is mainly raw materials. Not enough sales to have a large stock of 
finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
Don't make a substantial investment in facilities at this stage. Lease a small 
building and minimum equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts payable is the biggest liability because equity and debt financing is 
still difficult to obtain. Negotiate good terms with vendors. 
</P>
<P>
To minimize cash flow, lease equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Equity will tend to consist of personal funds, including loans and retained 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHASE TWO: GROWTH 
</P>
<P>
Sales should be increasing, and efforts should be aimed at exploiting the 
market. Keep product development costs at about the same percentage as in 
development stage. Personnel increases will be required, but keep it under 
control. For most firms, office and management systems for record-keeping, 
information processing and inventory control won't keep pace with growth. Cash 
shortages are common, so good bookkeeping is critical. If new facilities are 
necessary, don't go overboard. It is cheaper to move again than to pay for 
unused space. 
</P>
<P>
Assets 
</P>
<P>
Property, Plant and Equipment 20% 
</P>
<P>
Cash 5% 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Receivable 35% 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Other Assets 5% 
</P>
<P>
Liabilities &amp; Equity 
</P>
<P>
Equity 35% 
</P>
<P>
Short-Term Financing 15% 
</P>
<P>
Long-Term 
</P>
<P>
Financing 15% 
</P>
<P>
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 35% 
</P>
<P>
CHARACTERISTICS: 
</P>
<P>
Cash is tight during growth. Reserves are almost gone. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts receivable grow because emphasis is on sales rather than on cash 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Inventory is a combination of raw material and work in progress. Stay alert to 
avoid accumulating obsolete material. 
</P>
<P>
Most funds are left in the business, not withdrawn by owner. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are more willing to extend credit lines, collateralized by accounts 
receivable and inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors continue to help finance growth with extended credit terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHASE THREE: PROFITABILITY AND MATURITY 
</P>
<P>
The focus is now on profits rather than sales. Financial arrangements with 
banks and vendors should be improved. Management systems should be brought up 
to date. Tax planning becomes increasingly important. This is the time to start 
a program to reward key employees who contributed to the firm's success. It 
will become necessary to decide whether to push for more expansion, to maintain 
the status quo or to sell the business and take profits. 
</P>
<P>
Assets 
</P>

Property, Plant and Equipment 25%

<P>

</P>
<P>
Long-Term Financing 15% 
</P>
<P>
Short-Term Financing 20% 
</P>
<P>
Accounts Payable and Accrued 
</P>
<P>
Expenses 20% 
</P>
<P>
CHARACTERISTICS: 
</P>
<P>
Cash reserves increase because of retained profits. 
</P>
<P>
Receivables and inventory are less significant because management systems have 
improved and the customer base has stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
Inventory is primarily mainly finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
Property, plant and equipment costs remain the same, most equipment is 
purchased rather than leased. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors extend favorable credit terms because bank credit can be used to take 
advantage of vendor discounts for early payment. 
</P>
<P>
Personal funds can be drawn out of the company, replaced by equity from outside 
investors. Depending on tax strategy, cash flow can be distributed through 
dividends, bonuses or salary increases.

Bramalea California Inc. is moving up -- literally. The Costa Mesa home builder 
-- already in the news this year for the $250-million acquisition of 
Marlborough Homes in Los Angeles -- said it is moving into the top two floors 
of Jamboree Center's 1 Park Plaza in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
That makes it the biggest tenant -- with 28,000 square feet of office space -- 
in the first phase of the Irvine Co.'s office park at Jamboree Road and the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Bramalea, the U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian public company, will be on the 11th 
and 12th floors, having signed a five-year lease for $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company will move from four one-story office condominiums near the John 
Wayne Airport in Costa Mesa, allowing it to consolidate operations in one 
building for the first time, said Samuel E. Haynes, Bramalea's executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
With Marlborough, Bramalea would have been the region's sixth-biggest home 
builder last year.

Akins Development Co., a smaller Orange County home builder, said it is making 
its first move into San Bernardino and Riverside counties with $50 million 
worth of new homes in San Bernardino's Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
Akins said it will build 145 homes with prices set to start in the low $300,000 
range. The smaller builder is doing the project as a joint venture with the 
massive William Lyon Co. 
</P>
<P>
Akins has already built extensively in Orange County but, like other local home 
builders, has been drawn to the cheaper land and livelier housing markets of 
the two inland counties.

GUITARIST HEALEY PACKS NOVELTY IN INTENSE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Healey is one tremendous guitarist, and he pretty much had to be Thursday 
night at the Coach House to make up for the 2 1/2 hours that passed before he 
came on-stage. With that time filled by: 
</P>
<P>
The tail end of the Lakers' defeat on big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
A crunch-bent opening band. 
</P>
<P>
A protracted stage setup, with plenty of hammering and feedback squeals, as the 
room grew progressively warmer, 
</P>
<P>
Healey had a lot of ill feeling to conquer. 
</P>
<P>
The early evening evidently hadn't been a picnic for Healey either, as he had 
been up in Burbank to appear on the "Tonight Show," only to be bumped for lack 
of time, and then encountered that bit of permanent sculpture known as 
Southland freeway traffic. But a dose of snarling, rampant guitar can ease a 
lot of tensions, and Healey delivered just that, if not too much more. 
</P>
<P>
In a few short months, Healey has gone from an unknown find of the guitar mags 
to a media figure, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Swayze in "Roadhouse," touted 
in this week's People magazine and generally being hailed as the first post-Lee 
Atwater guitar hero. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the impediment of being sightless, Healey has developed a 
boundary-stretching technique of guitar playing that is nearly without 
precedent (country player Thumbs Carlisle made some moves in the same direction 
in the '50s). Rather than approach the strings by grasping the neck as most 
guitarists do, Healey rests the instrument on his lap and frets it by pressing 
his fingers down on the strings from above. 
</P>
<P>
While that may seem impossibly awkward to conventional players, Healey's 
13-song set nearly made it look like everyone else has been doing it wrong. His 
playing had a tremendous speed and a remarkably controlled hand vibrato, and he 
made complex rhythm-solo trade-offs and unconventional interval jumps seem 
effortless. 
</P>
<P>
Healey is also an ideal roadhouse showman, with an intense if undistinguished 
vocal delivery, a comic demeanor and a full stock of stage antics, including 
dancing about the stage while playing the guitar with his teeth and behind his 
back (finding a way of doing both at once may be the next guitar hero hurdle). 
</P>
<P>
But, as with jazz's finger-tapping Stanley Jordan, it is possible that the 
novelty of Healey's staggering technique is taking precedence over what he is 
actually doing with it. At this point in his career, there just isn't that much 
depth behind his blistering attack. Only occasionally did his playing convey 
the emotion and expressiveness that sets great musicians apart. In that regard, 
there are any number of blues men with comparatively little facility on their 
instrument who, nevertheless, can make the instrument sing straight to the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Healey came to that in his set of debut album songs and '60s 
standards was during the John Hiatt ballad "Angel Eyes" and a cover of 
Hendrix's "Little Wing," each of which found him backing off the flash to 
squeeze lyrical solos from his strings. On the more boisterous side, the Doors' 
"Road House Blues" and Dylan's "When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky," 
with its "All Along the Watchtower" changes, afforded Healey a chance to burn 
so hard and fast that subtlety and voice were hardly missed in the onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
Opener Kills for Thrills was one of the most compelling bands this writer has 
witnessed in some time: It had barely started playing when a great many in the 
audience felt compelled to stuff fingers and napkin bits in their ears to 
lessen the deafening, but otherwise harmless, lifeless thrust of the quartet's 
leftover meat-and-potatoes rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The group does deserve big points, though, for its Spinal Tap-grade 
between-song pronouncements including, "We apologize for the volume, but you 
gotta do what you gotta do, you know," and "This is a song we wrote for 
brotherhood, and everything in general." Right on.

IS IT RACIAL BIAS? FLYER'S AUTHOR RAISES POSSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody ever said that raising money for the arts was easy. But the Orange 
County Black Actors Theatre is having a doubly difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is seeking $10,000 "to close the gap between production costs and 
potential ticket income" from its revival of the Broadway musical "Ain't 
Misbehavin', " which is scheduled for a 10-day engagement (July 6 to 16) on the 
Second Stage at South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
An unsigned flyer mailed recently to 2,700 theatergoers declared that corporate 
donors have rebuffed the troupe's requests for contributions on grounds that 
they already support larger arts organizations; but the flyer also implied 
racial bias in those rebuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our requests for donations from the corporate sector," the flyer said, "have 
received responses such as: 'We are already committed to South Coast Repertory 
and the (Orange County) Performing Arts Center, and we feel this support serves 
the black community.' " 
</P>
<P>
Adleane Hunter, artistic director of the nonprofit troupe, acknowledged this 
week that she had written the flyer, and confirmed that the implication of bias 
was intended. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so frustrating to constantly get responses like the one I quoted," she 
said. "I got that one from a community-relations director of a large 
corporation in Orange County. And, believe me, it was not the first one. My 
reaction is that it has a racial overtone. It's a form of tokenism." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who declined to identify the executive, said corporations "are letting 
themselves off the hook" by claiming to serve the black community by donating 
to arts institutions without having to donate to any black organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think South Coast Repertory and the Performing Arts Center are both 
important," she said, "but nobody serves the black community as well as we do." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter pegged the production costs for "Ain't Misbehavin' " at $41,000. The 
troupe has received grants from the California Arts Council totaling $8,900 in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
ART SALE: Today is the do-or-die "Slaves to ART Parking Lot Sale," a 
fund-raiser designed to help save the Alternative Repertory Theatre from 
financial extinction. The 2-year-old Santa Ana troupe has said it needs to 
raise $7,000 by the middle of this month to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're closing in on the halfway mark," ART business manager David C. Palmer 
said earlier this week, citing "a turnaround" in attendance over the past two 
weekends. "If things continue on this course, I have every confidence we'll 
make it. But we're not over the hump yet." 
</P>
<P>
The storefront theater must fill half of its 61 seats on average to break even. 
It had been doing less than that for the last five months. For the past two 
Saturdays, however, attendance couldn't be better. "We sold out the house both 
times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The current offering -- William Hanley's "Slow Dance on the Killing Ground" -- 
is scheduled to run through next Saturday. The parking-lot sale of donated 
items will take place at the theater (1636 S. Grand Ave., near Edinger Avenue) 
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Information: (714) 836-7929. 
</P>
<P>
ONE-ACTS GALORE: They did it before -- for three years in the early '80s -- and 
it was so much fun that they've decided to do it again. "It" is a one-act play 
festival that the Newport Beach Theatre Arts Center will sponsor for local 
community theater companies from July 20 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be to resurrect the festival as one of the closing events 
of the Orange County Centennial celebration," said Rae Cohen, president of the 
93-seat Theatre Arts Center. "The only reason we discontinued it was because we 
were remodeling at the time." 
</P>
<P>
So who's coming? And what will they be doing? Four troupes will stage one-acts 
and eight will stage excerpts from full-length works. 
</P>
<P>
The one-acts: "Men's Singles" (Garden Grove Community Theatre); "The Zoo Story" 
(Huntington Beach Community Playhouse); "Graceland" (Newport Beach Theatre Arts 
Center); "Balcony Scene" (Ana-Modjeska of Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
The excerpts: "Monday After the Miracle" (Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse); "Boy 
Meets Girl" (La Habra Depot Theatre); "Bullshot Crummond" (the Cabrillo 
Playhouse); "The Little Shop of Horrors" (Buena Park Civic Theatre); "Tintypes" 
(Westminster Community Theatre); "The Pirates of Penzance" (Brea Theatre 
Guild); "She Was Only a Farmer's Daughter" (Cypress Civic Theatre); "Greater 
Tuna" (Irvine Community Theatre).

<P>
I am writing to commend Jan Herman on his coverage of the financial 
difficulties that the Alternative Repertory Theatre of Santa Ana is having. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen every production that ART has mounted, I know what a cultural 
resource this theater company is becoming. Orange County needs this company's 
survival. It is gratifying to see The Times be so supportive of ART's 
endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
I would encourage all of your readers to come and see what is happening at this 
intimate theater in Santa Ana. It is well worth the time and effort.

ORANGE COUNTY'S 42 MILES OF BEACHES ASSURE EVERYONE A PLACE IN THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can wind-surf the gentle waves at Seal Beach. Picnic on the broad sand at 
Huntington or body-surf the thunderous Wedge at the end of Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
You can sun and be seen at Corona del Mar. Scuba through rocky, underwater 
coves off Laguna Beach or ride the ocean's edge on skim boards at Aliso Beach 
County Park. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at almost all of Orange County's 42-mile sweep of beaches, you can 
swim -- if you can brave the bracing 58- to 68-degree summer water temperature. 
</P>
<P>
The county coastline has been consistently praised as among the most diverse 
and accessible in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The coast has sometimes been referred to as the California Riviera," said 
Patti Schooley, a parks district supervisor for the Harbors, Beaches and Parks 
Division of the county Environmental Management Agency. "Traditionally in 
Orange County, there's been a big push to have public access to these beaches. 
There are a lot of . . . activities and amenities and towns, and there really 
aren't any better examples of sandy beaches anywhere along the state." 
</P>
<P>
This month marks the beginning of the massive yearly migration of residents to 
county beaches. They come by the thousands, sometimes by the hundreds of 
thousands -- more than a half million on July 4, the busiest beach day of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
From north to south, beach by beach, here is what they will find. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach, Surfside, Huntington Beach -- This strip of coastline offers the 
county's largest, flattest and widest beaches, particularly along Huntington 
Beach. It draws immense crowds on the hottest summer days, but cooling breezes 
often provide the trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach is "the king of windsurfing," said lifeguard Steve Kumashiro, 
because of frequent, brisk breezes there. Anglers also make year-round use of 
the pier. The city beach is about a mile long, between the San Gabriel River 
and the Anaheim Bay jetties. It is not considered a good surfing spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We occasionally have nice swells, but they don't get as big as they do at 
Bolsa Chica or Huntington Beach. We get mostly Boogie Boarders and swimmers and 
body surfers," Kumashiro said. 
</P>
<P>
The summer crowd is generally high school age, and a lot of meeting and 
greeting goes on along the sand. 
</P>
<P>
To the southeast, beyond Anaheim Bay, is the community of Surfside, and a beach 
administered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a swimmer's beach, although certain areas attract surfers," 
Schooley said. "The swimming is typically safe, because the area isn't prone to 
high waves or bad currents." 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent Sunset Beach offers a pedestrian and bike path along a grassy strip. 
Surfing is allowed off part of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica State Beach begins to the southeast across Warner Avenue. In the 
late 1950s, before the state took over the area, the strand was known popularly 
as Tin Can Beach because thousands of rusting cans and other trash littered the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it is a clean, flat, 3.5-mile-long sandy beach with a promenade used by 
cyclists, pedestrians, skateboarders and roller skaters. 
</P>
<P>
The entire beach, lifeguard Lon Graham said, is "excellent for beginning 
surfers." Fire rings placed at intervals make it popular for barbecues and 
picnics. 
</P>
<P>
Grunion fanciers often come to the beach for runs between March and August. 
</P>
<P>
Across Pacific Coast Highway is the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, a wetlands 
area popular for nature walks and bird watching. 
</P>
<P>
The adjacent Huntington City Beach is known as surf city, said Mike Beuerlein, 
a city lifeguard supervisor. "The landmark pier is the primary point for most 
surfers. That's where the OP Pro surfing competition takes place each year, and 
that's the granddaddy of all surfing competitions. It's the foremost 
international surfing event in the world, and we get crowds of between 75,000 
and 100,000 people here over the five days." 
</P>
<P>
The prized waves are generated because of the effect of a man-made reef 
constructed offshore by the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1950s as well as currents 
caused by the pier's pilings, Beuerlein said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Saenz, manager of the Huntington Surf and Sport store, praised the area 
for its consistent waves. R.B. Alexander, owner of Hobie Sports Ltd., in Corona 
del Mar, said the city beach challenges the surfer who has some experience and 
is ready to graduate to larger, more difficult waves. 
</P>
<P>
Farther to the northwest is the area known as the Huntington Bluffs, which is 
more difficult to get to -- by foot down the steep bluffs -- but it offers 
gentler waves breaking farther away from shore. 
</P>
<P>
Just to the southeast, Huntington State Beach is an intensely busy stretch for 
the lifeguards who work there, state lifeguard Jim Balok said. Because of its 
size and large parking area, it and the rest of the Huntington Beach coast 
often are packed. 
</P>
<P>
"On Memorial Day, we had 110 rescues, just that one day," Balok said. 
</P>
<P>
The beach has designated surfing and swimming areas (south of Lifeguard Tower 2 
and north of that tower, respectively). It also may be the beach barbecue 
capital with 700 fire pits available day and night. 
</P>
<P>
The area offers good surfing because of two offshore sand bars that create a 
shore and an outside break and give the waves good tubular formation, Balok 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach, Corona del Mar -- Come to this stretch of beach to see and be 
seen. The latest bathing suits, the best in new surfing gear, the most 
flamboyant sports cars, the most cultivated tans -- they're all here along 
Orange County's wealthiest coast. 
</P>
<P>
Parking, however, can be a nightmare, and enforcement of regulations stiff, but 
this area offers unique rewards, from the county's freshest fish to its most 
vicious waves. 
</P>
<P>
Said marine safety officer Eric Bauer: "In the summertime, you've got to get 
down here early and get a parking space (on the street, both free and metered) 
or you won't get a spot. And if you park somewhere illegally, you're guaranteed 
to get a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach's six miles of oceanfront are rich with people-watching 
opportunities and waterside atmosphere, especially along the Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The West Newport and peninsula beaches are used mainly for sunning and some 
surfing, Bauer said, and the beach near 18th Street, known as the Point, 
sometimes has what he called "some of the best big-wave surfing. It's rare, but 
sometimes there have been waves up to 15 or 20 feet with very good shape." 
</P>
<P>
The beach at 56th Street usually features waves requiring skill and experience, 
said Alexander of Hobie Sports. Consequently, surfers there show off their 
finery as well as their athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
A well-used bicycle path runs the length of the beach, and there are boardwalks 
near the Balboa and Newport piers. The Newport Beach Dory Fleet sells daily 
fresh fish next to the Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
For body surfers -- good ones -- the Wedge is the legendary mecca, with its 
vicious V-shaped break off the western jetty of the harbor mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Across from it in Corona del Mar is Big Corona, a favorite family picnicking 
and sunning spot. And just southeast is Little Corona, a marine preserve with 
tide pools that draw beachcombers. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport area in general is a highly social beach, when beach-goers often 
take advantage of the Fun Zone, Balboa Pavilion, restaurants, harbor tours and 
other bay attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"We can get as many as 100,000 to 110,000 people here on a good weekend," Bauer 
said. "It's the place to be in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coast, Laguna Beach, South Laguna -- Rugged, often steep, with thin 
slices of beach, the south central coast is more varied than its northern 
counterparts. It's also the shore diver's dream with sheltered coves, mild 
waves and easy access. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Cove State Park on the Irvine coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna 
Beach is an underwater reserve for scuba divers. Nearby is Seal Rock, where 
elephant seals and California sea lions often sun themselves and occasionally 
swim with divers. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south are a series of rugged coves -- principally Shaw's Cove, Diver's 
Cove, Fisherman's Cove and Main Beach -- considered ideal for diving classes, 
scuba diving and snorkeling, said Michael Janssen, sales manager of Black 
Bart's Aquatics in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the best beach diving in the area," he said. "The nice thing is, 
you can make a dive or two by noon and eat lunch and you have the rest of the 
day to do something else. On a boat dive to Catalina, you spend all day. You 
can stay near the rocks, or dive with the seals at Seal Rock, or swim out to 
the kelp beds and sandy areas. And there are steps down to the coves, so 
they're easily accessible. It isn't like you have to haul your gear down steep 
slopes to get to the water." 
</P>
<P>
Most Laguna Beach coves are encompassed by a marine preserve; underwater 
hunting is not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna's Main Beach is the most visible spot along that part of the coast. It 
has a curving boardwalk, volleyball and basketball courts and lifeguard tower, 
which is a popular meeting place for young visitors, lifeguard Seth Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, Aliso Beach County Park is a favorite of sunbathers and 
swimmers, "although it tends to have a pretty treacherous shore break with a 
lot of power," said Schooley of the Environmental Management Agency. "It's 
popular for skim boarding, but very little surfing." 
</P>
<P>
Many small coves dot the South Laguna area, such as Coast Royale -- good for 
swimming -- and Thousand Steps Beach -- good for swimming, body boarding and 
volleyball. The name is apt: It takes a strong pair of lungs to negotiate the 
steps from the highway to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point, Capistrano Beach, San Clemente -- The southernmost beaches are an 
amalgam of the others: wide, flat and accommodating at Doheny State Beach and 
along much of San Clemente, yet haunting, rocky, even lonely as the beach 
approaches the open spaces near San Onofre at the county line. 
</P>
<P>
Salt Creek Beach is a well-liked surfing spot with picnic facilities and a half 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Doheny State Beach at Dana Point is one of the best to "take a neophyte surfer 
and say, 'This is the sport. This is what it's all about,' " Alexander said. 
"You can send a guy there at any stage of his surfing career, and he can have a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
The beach usually offers overnight campsites, but they are being renovated this 
year and are closed for the summer, park aide Ginny McVickar said. 
</P>
<P>
The beach does have an "interpretive center" with three aquariums, an indoor 
tide pool and a gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, Capistrano Beach Park, with its eight volleyball courts, fire 
pits and metered parking, offer a half-mile-long beach mainly used for 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby San Clemente city beaches have long been known as family retreats, as 
well as good year-round, designated surfing beaches, said city marine safety 
officer Steve Lashbrook. The three main surfing areas are south of Trafalgar 
Street, on the north side of the pier and at a nearby beach known as 204 (for a 
railroad mileage sign marking the spot). 
</P>
<P>
The lively, youthful social life of Huntington and Newport beaches usually is 
not seen in San Clemente, Lashbrook said, "because people's interests here are 
so diverse -- surfing, skim boarding, swimming -- and because of the family 
orientation." 
</P>
<P>
At the southernmost tip of the county San Clemente State Beach offers some of 
the finest surfing on the coast, particularly at Trestles Beach (below the old 
Western White House) and adjacent beaches. The 72 hookup sites there for 
recreational vehicles are being refurbished and will be available in mid-July, 
said Allen Oliver, district superintendent for the Pendleton Coast State Parks 
District. When the RV sites reopen, the family campsites will be closed for the 
duration of the summer for refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
The state beach as well as the adjacent San Onofre State Beach over the county 
line reminds Oliver of uncrowded beaches from the '40s: "It's like taking a 
step back in time."

JOSEPH N. BELL: '80S MARRIAGE: 2 JOBS, 1 KID AND NO TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sociologists generally agree that the most important social change that has 
taken place in this country over the past two decades is the growing percentage 
of working women. 
</P>
<P>
Latest figures compiled by the U.S. Bureau of the Census show that in the 
United States in 1985, 62% of women with children under 18 were in the labor 
force. Muriel Mabry, who is president of Orange County's Women's World 
International and close to the local employment scene, says "that figure is 
probably much higher in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of attention has been paid to how all of this affects our children, but 
only recently have we begun to look more closely at how it affects the 
relationship between marriage partners. There are two schools of thought on 
this point. One says that the main hope for reducing the escalating divorce 
rate is the fact that marriage partners aren't around each other a lot anymore 
and therefore don't have as much to fight about. The other school says the 
whole society is likely to go to hell in a handbasket if we don't do something 
about the growing dysfunctionality of the American home. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I both work. Until recently, we both worked outside the home. Now I 
do much of my work at home, which I suppose makes us less typical, but not 
much. We've been aware of the fact that we don't see much of each other -- 
especially during the week. So we've looked for ways to do something about it 
that are compatible with the demands of the workplace, an 11-year-old child, a 
bubble-headed dog and an old house that creaks and groans. For the 
enlightenment of other married couples facing the same problem, here are three 
of the ideas we've tried -- and how they worked out: 
</P>
<P>
* The tete-a-tete lunch. Business lunches have become de rigueur in the kind of 
high-tech society we have in Orange County, so we reasoned: Why not turn lunch 
into the business of occasionally getting reacquainted with one's spouse? This 
would detract nothing from the business day, since we both have to eat lunch 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Certain logistical problems arose. When one partner is accustomed to eating a 
hearty lunch at noon and the other a cup of yogurt at 1:30, someone has to bend 
on timing. Then there is the matter of whether to have a quick lunch in the 
company cafeteria or meet over a glass of Chardonnay in a splendid restaurant, 
complete with candles on the table and men in vests talking in confidential 
tones to women one suspects are not their wives. Finally, there is the matter 
of agenda. Should we talk about our work, our finances, the problems in China 
-- or try to simulate the confidential tone at the next table. 
</P>
<P>
We haven't really answered any of these questions definitively yet, even though 
we've tried them all. What usually happens is that on Sunday night -- full of 
optimism and hope -- we make a date for lunch on Wednesday. Then about 11 
o'clock on Wednesday morning, my wife phones. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a crisis here, and I can't get away until about 2:30. Would that be 
OK?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, it wouldn't be OK. I had a bowl of oatmeal at 6:30 and I'm starving." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if your stomach is more important than our relationship, then go eat. 
We'll do it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a tennis game at 2. If we could just do it early. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
So we have a quick lunch on Thursday. Just before I leave the house, I get a 
letter that our variable mortgage rate has been kicked up. Most of the lunch 
period is spent figuring out how we are going to pay the increase. I'm still 
hungry when I leave, and we decide to go the candles-on-the-table route next 
time, however long it takes. 
</P>
<P>
* Cocktail hour. My wife's guilt over being a career woman has always required 
her to "pay attention" to the 11-year-old kid when she gets home from work, 
whether he wants attention or not. Since he's not usually around anymore, we 
decided to have a cocktail hour to exchange the vicissitudes of our day over a 
cool drink. 
</P>
<P>
In our system, whoever gets home first -- which about 95% of the time is me -- 
starts dinner so it is ready by 7:30. Cocktail hour is set for 6:45, earlier if 
possible. A typical cocktail hour goes something like this: My wife calls at 
6:30 and says she's on her way home. I make her a gin-and-tonic and a martini 
for myself. On the rocks. An olive and a twist both. She arrives at 7:10, 
breathless (we live 10 minutes from her office), explaining that a crisis arose 
as she was going out the door. She stops to check her mail and lingers over a 
Spiegel catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
When I get restless, she tells me to fix her a drink while she changes. I tell 
her I made the drink 20 minutes ago and the ice has now melted into the gin. 
When she reappears, we have seven minutes before dinner. Just then, the 
11-year-old kid shows up, asking to be drilled on state capitals since he has a 
test the next day. Guilt takes over my wife. When they get to Montana, I smell 
the food burning, and I eat in surly silence while they babble about geography, 
which neither of them knows much of anything about. 
</P>
<P>
* Pillow talk. The theory here is that when the kid goes to bed, we'll have 
quiet time to talk. We'll go to bed early and lie there and talk about our day. 
The first hitch is that the kid never gets to bed when he should. There's 
always a reason, of course, and his lasting power is awesome. But he finally 
gets down, and we have (yawn) quiet time. In the middle of an explanation of a 
writing problem I had that day that is searing my soul, I become aware of 
measured breathing. She struggles to the surface two or three times after that, 
but the cause is lost. I go back to the sports page I was reading while I was 
waiting for the cocktail hour to start. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, we still have a few bugs in these ideas. They show enormous 
promise on paper, but there seems to be something lacking in the execution. 
We're working on it.
