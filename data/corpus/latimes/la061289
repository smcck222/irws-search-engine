2 CHINA ENVOYS IN SAN FRANCISCO SEEK ASYLUM

<P>
Two Chinese diplomats were under FBI protection Sunday after they announced 
their intention to defect to the United States in protest of their government's 
violent suppression of the student movement for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators at a candlelight vigil for the victims of the 
violence in China wept Saturday night when the two Chinese consular officials 
made their unexpected announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my friends have lost their lives and we wanted to do something to show 
we support what they stood for," one of the diplomats said to the crowd. 
"Compared to them, I am not brave at all. They are brave for standing up for 
democracy in the face of death or imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
The two diplomats were identified by the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco as 
Zhou Liming, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang Limin, 25, a staff 
member at the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 5,000 who gathered solemnly in front of San Francisco City Hall 
with candles and flashlights broke out into cheers when the two men spoke. 
Demonstrators said they hoped the two would be the first of many to seek 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech to the crowd, the consular officials said they could no 
longer support the Chinese government and would not lie to cover up their 
government's policies. 
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed," one diplomat 
said. "Why? Because we are diplomats. But we won't fake it here. Before we are 
diplomats, we are Chinese and we are human beings. We are public servants -- we 
are not slaves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner at Consulate 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, according to demonstrators who talked to the diplomats, the 
two officials had dinner at the consulate, then walked a short distance to a 
pay phone so they could notify the FBI that they planned to defect at the rally 
a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
At first, organizers of the rally were uncertain if the two were sincere or, 
perhaps, were planning to disrupt the vigil. They were finally allowed to speak 
to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Their speech both stunned and moved the crowd of demonstrators, many of whom 
ran up and hugged the two diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is surprised they showed up and that they would give up everything," 
said Mary Kao, president of the Chinese Overseas Students Assn. at San 
Francisco State University. "Since they are the first ones, they might 
encourage others to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
After their speech, the pair were led into City Hall and were whisked away by 
FBI agents, who took them to an undisclosed location. The two diplomats have 
made no public comments since the rally. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in San Francisco said the diplomats' appeal for political 
asylum is being sent to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for 
review. David Ilchert, the INS district director in San Francisco, said he had 
no information on the diplomats' cases and had not yet received a formal 
request for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators who talked with the two diplomats during the rally said both men 
had been in the United States for about two years and were unmarried. Huang 
Jingsheng, a graduate student from Stanford University, said both men fear that 
family members in China might suffer repercussions from their defection. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese students in Los Angeles also were cheering good news on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before the two diplomats announced their intention to defect on 
Saturday, UCLA graduate student Tong Boning stepped off a flight from China, 
where he had been detained and interrogated by members of the state Public 
Security Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Tong had returned to China on May 19 to observe the demonstrations and carry 
back $8,000 in donations raised by students from throughout Southern 
California. He was scheduled to return to America on June 5 but was detained at 
the airport in China and taken to a motel for interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
For six days, his friends in Los Angeles anxiously awaited word on his fate. 
They believed he had been arrested or possibly even executed. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since returning to this country, Tong, a Chinese citizen, 
talked about his experiences over the last week. 
</P>
<P>
He was surprisingly calm about an experience that had terrified his friends 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought as long as they didn't kill me, it would be OK," he said. "I didn't 
care if they arrested me and put me in jail. It would not last long. A bright 
day would come eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Tong said he was taken from the airport in a white van and held in a simple 
room with two beds, two sofas and a television on the outskirts of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guarded at All Times 
</P>
<P>
A pair of officers from the Public Security Bureau guarded him at all times, he 
said. During the day he was interrogated by officials who asked: 
</P>
<P>
"Who sent you to China?" 
</P>
<P>
"What did you do here?" 
</P>
<P>
"What did you use the money for?" 
</P>
<P>
Tong said he was asked the same questions repeatedly. At first, he admitted, he 
feared he might be executed. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not treated harshly during his detention. He saw no other 
students, although he could hear the child of a friend he was traveling with 
talking nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Saturday he was suddenly told to get ready to return to America. He 
boarded the plane and 15 hours later arrived at San Francisco International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought to myself, 'Free at last,' " he said. 
</P>

<P>
To the rest of the world, the brazen openness of China's massacre of unarmed 
civilians in Beijing seems inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign correspondents present in Beijing in those bloody pre-dawn hours of 
June 4 felt almost as though Chinese authorities were handing them a telephone 
and inviting them to phone home with news of the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
So far as is known, China made no effort to cut telephone or telex lines. 
Television film made its way out of the country. Chinese authorities made no 
attempt to round up or deport journalists before the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
There were quite a few individual problems, to be sure. But on the whole, the 
world press found it much easier to witness the massacre in Beijing than, say, 
the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada or last year's ethnic strife in Soviet 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't the Chinese leaders care? Why didn't they try to take steps that would 
minimize the world's knowledge of the slaughter and the reaction to it, which 
could have a devastating effect on the Chinese economy? 
</P>
<P>
The answers to those questions could be important, because they could provide a 
clue to China's future direction, both on foreign and economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
Among China specialists, there are, essentially, two different theories about 
the brazenness with which the Chinese regime let the world see the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
One is the inefficiency theory. In the chaos and turbulence of the moment, this 
theory goes, the Chinese regime simply lacked the ability to do what would have 
been necessary to shut off foreign media coverage of the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
The second theory -- one with considerably greater long-range significance -- 
is that the brazenness was deliberate. According to this theory, at least some 
elements in the Chinese leadership not only didn't care what the outside world 
thought of the massacre but actually wanted the world to know. If foreign 
countries and companies were to respond by reducing their presence in China, so 
much the better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debate Over World Ties 
</P>
<P>
One senior U.S. diplomat said in an interview last week that he believes some 
elements of the Chinese leadership, such as Premier Li Peng, would like to cut 
back dramatically on China's contacts with the West because the economic ties 
limit China's effort to run its own, self-sufficient "command" economy. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who has now vanished from sight 
and has apparently been ousted, has in recent years been the principal advocate 
of having China develop a market economy, with growth tied to exports and 
closer links with the outside world. Li Peng has been the principal defender of 
China's old-style, centrally planned "command" economy. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders such as Li, this official said, "don't really want to be in the world 
economy. They want China to be autarkic (economically self-contained). They 
don't want foreigners to influence what their prices are. And the message 
they're conveying now is: 'Look what happens when we open up our economy. We 
get all these mosquitoes, these bad influences, coming in.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Total Clampdown' Seen 
</P>
<P>
This official suggested that China will soon begin a "total clampdown" on 
students' going overseas. And the regime will likely cut back on the kinds of 
intellectual exchanges that have taken place in recent years -- such as visits 
by American lawyers who give lectures on the concept of checks and balances on 
government power, or fellowships for Western journalists who bring into China 
ideas about freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
An American businessman who worked until recently in China said that he, too, 
has begun to believe the regime's openness in repressing the pro-democracy 
movement has deep economic roots. 
</P>
<P>
"A possible explanation could be that they want to close down the country and 
to get the foreigners out," said Don St. Pierre, who served as president of the 
Beijing Jeep Corp., an automotive joint venture between China and American 
Motors Co. (now Chrysler) from 1985 until last year. "I'm not certain about 
that, but it's a suspicion that I have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreigners Exaggerate Role 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this theory may be attributing too much planning and 
motivation to the Chinese leadership. The regime's aim was to suppress the 
pro-democracy movement among Chinese themselves. Over the centuries, foreigners 
have often exaggerated the role they play and the influence they exert inside 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Whether China could have successfully restricted foreign media coverage of the 
Beijing massacre is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. communications specialists familiar with China's telephone 
system, shutting down international direct-dial phone links would not have been 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
China's IDD phone system is connected to its direct-dial system within its own 
borders -- a fact that itself is an ironic reflection of China's growing 
economic ties with the outside world. So cutting off calls to New York, London 
and Tokyo would have also meant stopping direct-dial calls from Beijing to 
Shanghai, Canton and many other Chinese cities. (China's People's Liberation 
Army has its own communications system, independent of the regular civilian 
phone network.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time-Consuming Action 
</P>
<P>
Throwing foreign correspondents out of Beijing before the military action -- as 
Chinese authorities had previously done in Tibet -- would also have been 
extremely difficult and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese regime did have time available to it. In the days leading 
up to the original military move toward downtown on the night of Friday, June 
2, there was a lull in the pace of events in Beijing. The crowds of 
demonstrators at Tian An Men Square had dwindled to fewer than 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Chinese leadership that controlled the pace of events. There was no 
apparent urgency behind the decision to call the PLA into downtown Beijing. The 
downtown area was relatively quiet. The PLA had held off moving into the city 
for more than 10 days, and it could have waited a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after the Chinese troops first tried to move into downtown that 
Friday night that the crowds at Tian An Men Square swelled once again and the 
situation became chaotic. After that juncture -- a time of the Chinese 
leadership's own choosing -- it may have been too late to try to limit the 
impact overseas of a bloody confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
There is an old Chinese expression that goes, roughly, "Before you beat your 
dog, make sure to shut the gate." During the massacre of Beijing, China's 
hard-line leadership left its gates wide open for the world to see. The 
question now is whether the regime was trying to convey a message about its 
future policies.

A civilian technical expert was fired by the Navy after he complained of faulty 
radar equipment, the Hartford Courant reported. Joseph C. Richards, 42, of 
Lyme, Conn., told the paper he was dismissed from the Navy's Supervisor of 
Shipbuilding office in the Electric Boat Shipyard at Groton, Conn., after he 
reported problems with electronic towed array sonar systems towed behind 
688-Class attack submarines. Richards, who is appealing his dismissal, said 
that because of mistakes made at Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics 
Corp., sonar systems worth millions of dollars sometimes must be abandoned to 
keep the tow cable from fouling the submarine's propeller.

Members of the House Ethics Committee, not former Speaker Jim Wright, initiated 
an attempt to strike a deal and negotiate his resignation, the Dallas Times 
Herald reported. The newspaper reported that sources who asked not to be named 
said that Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) phoned Rep. 
Louis Stokes (D-Ohio), the former ethics chairman, and said that Wright's 
resignation would "spare the House a harsh and divisive confrontation." Wright 
reportedly authorized negotiations but did not approach the committee to 
discuss a deal when it convened later. Wright announced his plans to resign in 
a speech May 31.

 -- Wild applause and shouts of "Bravo!" rang out in Ft. Worth on Sunday after 
it was announced that the youngest of 38 competitors in the Eighth Van Cliburn 
International Piano Competition had won first place. Nineteen-year-old Aleksei 
Sultanov of the Soviet Union, regarded as the early crowd favorite for his 
aggressive performances, shook hands with Van Cliburn and actor Dudley Moore, 
who served as host. Jose Carlos Cocarelli, 30, of Brazil won the silver medal 
and Benedetto Lupo, 25, of Italy got the bronze. Sultanov attends Moscow State 
University and studies under L.N. Naumov, who taught two other Cliburn 
medalists. For winning the coveted competition, Sultanov receives a gold medal, 
$15,000, a Carnegie Hall recital, concert tours and free air travel. As a 
finalist, he played Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor and Rachmaninoff's 
Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor.

 -- About 4,000 Americans will turn 65 today -- and among them will be the most 
important man in the land: President Bush. How all will celebrate their special 
day is anybody's guess. But in the case of the President, he is expected to 
unveil his plan for cleaning up the nation's air and then travel to the Grand 
Tetons and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. His age has attracted little 
attention, because he succeeded Ronald Reagan, who was 77 when he left office, 
and because, put simply, he looks years younger than he is. Dr. Burton Lee, the 
White House physician, said: "He's 10 years younger than his stated age, that's 
what he is." Bush, an avid jogger and tennis player, is "very active, very 
energetic," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ronald and Nancy Reagan -- who are on their first trip abroad since leaving 
the White House in January -- are not typical tourists. The Reagans were 
greeted by U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto and former Foreign Secretary Francis Pym 
upon their arrival at London's Heathrow Airport aboard a private Boeing 727 
jetliner. The couple waved to onlookers before entering a limousine and driving 
off without comment. The former President is to deliver the Churchill Memorial 
Lecture on Tuesday. The English Speaking Union invited Reagan to speak on "the 
problems, perils, challenges and opportunities confronting the English-speaking 
peoples of today." JAMES MARNELL

The mayor of South Lake Tahoe, his wife and 16 other people have been arrested 
in connection with a 20-month undercover drug and money-laundering 
investigation, authorities said. Mayor Terry Trupp and his wife, Kim, were 
taken into custody on federal conspiracy and money-laundering charges involving 
alleged efforts to launder about $750,000 to FBI and Internal Revenue Service 
agents, officials said. The Trupps, who are being held without bail in El 
Dorado County Jail, will be arraigned today before a federal magistrate. 
Besides the 18 arrested in the probe, dubbed "Deep Snow," authorities recovered 
about 12 kilograms of cocaine in arrests and seizures, agents said. No drugs 
were seized in the Trupps' arrests, investigators said.

A Concord man was run over and killed on Interstate 80 just after being kicked 
off a bus for rowdy behavior and left in the custody of two Roseville police 
officers, police said. Police Chief Gregory Cowart said that an investigation 
is being conducted to determine why the officers let Ronald Shuster, 34, walk 
away from the shoulder of the busy freeway. Shuster, paroled from state prison 
in Susanville on Thursday, was reportedly on his way to Concord when he 
reportedly walked onto the freeway traffic lanes and was struck by two 
vehicles. Cowart said he needs to find out why Shuster was not driven to a 
safer location and police are also seeking the driver of a pickup truck that 
hit Shuster and left the scene.

East German leader Erich Honecker said President Bush's proposal for a 
reduction in conventional arms in Europe is a welcome step that is in tune with 
Warsaw Pact desires for speedy negotiations, according to an interview with the 
Washington Post. However, Honecker rejected Bush's call for the Berlin Wall to 
be torn down, although he said his government wants "to humanize the border 
regime" as part of generally improving relations with Western Europe and the 
United States. The paper quoted Honecker as confirming that East German border 
guards have been ordered not to use deadly force to stop civilians who attempt 
to flee into West Germany unless the guards are threatened by the attempt.

Three hot-air balloonists died when their aircraft ran into a television 
transmitting tower's guy wires and plunged 1,000 feet to the ground near 
Garner, N.C. The accident occurred shortly after the balloon had taken off, 
said Capt. Macks Pickett of the Wake County Sheriff's Department. The gas 
valves feeding the burners that fill the gas bag with hot air were wide open, 
suggesting the pilot had been trying to gain altitude, rescuers said. Ronald E. 
Brady, co-owner of another charter balloon company nearby, said tricky winds 
had led his company to cancel flights. Brady said he was concerned about a 
shear -- an abrupt change in wind speed or direction -- detected in the 300- to 
400-foot range.

United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka wound up a weeklong demonstration 
against Pittston Coal Group Inc. at Charleston, W. Va., by promising to broaden 
the two-month-old miners' strike. "There's no doubt in my mind that it's going 
to expand," Trumka told a rally of about 12,000 strikers and their 
sympathizers. He would not say whether he would take the strike to other parts 
of the country, such as Kentucky, where about 200 Pittston miners remain on the 
job. On the final leg of a six-day march, Trumka led supporters to the state 
Capitol, where Gov. Gaston Caperton urged a compromise in the dispute over 
wages, benefits and work rules.

Late spring in Texas was anything but mild as the state was pounded by 
thunderstorms, tornadoes and golf-ball-size hail. Twisters touched down near 
Pandora, Langtry and San Antonio, damaging several buildings and a mobile home. 
The high winds picked up a storage shed and threw it 100 yards, while a tree 
snapped in San Antonio and fell on a home. The biggest hail fell in Kinney 
County and Ping-Pong-ball-size hail was reported at Alamo Heights. Four inches 
of rain fell in Abilene, pushing a foot of water over the spillway of Lytle 
Lake. The storms dumped heavy rain in Oklahoma and Kansas, causing rivers and 
streams to rise across the southern plains. Coffeyville, Kan., got 7 1/4 inches 
of rain. "These storms developed due to warm, humid Gulf of Mexico air 
streaming northward and an upper air disturbance moving across the central 
plains," said National Weather Service forecaster Brian Smith.

MORAL MAJORITY HAS REACHED GOAL, WILL DISSOLVE -- FALWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Claiming that his goal of prodding religious conservatives into the political 
arena has been achieved, the Rev. Jerry Falwell announced Sunday that he will 
dissolve the Moral Majority in August. 
</P>
<P>
"The Religious Right is solidly in place. . . . Moral Majority as an 
organization is no longer needed," Falwell said during a news conference as 
part of the Religion Newswriters Assn. meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
The independent Baptist pastor from Lynchburg, Va., founded the lobbying 
organization 10 years ago this month at a time when fundamentalists and the 
Religious Right had only begun to attract attention. He was here to speak 
Wednesday to an evangelists' meeting as part of the three-day annual convention 
of Southern Baptists, which opens Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Moral Majority was credited or blamed, depending on your perspective, for the 
election of Ronald Reagan to the Presidency in 1980" and the voters' rejection 
of some liberal U.S. senators, Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
That claim was disputed several years ago by some religious sociologists, who 
felt the political swing to the right was already occurring. Nevertheless, 
Falwell added that he thought it was likely that Reagan was reelected in 1984 
and succeeded by George Bush because of the galvanizing influence of Moral 
Majority. 
</P>
<P>
The organization -- and Falwell -- became symbols of the resurgent Religious 
Right. Newspapers and television shows increasingly sought out Falwell and 
others as spokesmen for conservative views -- a forum Falwell said did not 
exist in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Falwell said that before 1979 it was rare "that anyone with our 
point of view" would appear on Phil Donahue's talk show. "Now, I've been on the 
Donahue show 16 times and turned it down as many times because of scheduling 
problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Falwell, 55, acknowledged that Moral Majority reached its peak in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Moral Majority, which Falwell said registered "millions" of conservative voters 
who had previously shunned politics, raised a high of $11 million in 1984, but 
dropped to its lowest amounts over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We only raised about $3.5 million last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moral Majority never became a large membership organization, but developed a 
mailing list of 50,000 pastors, Falwell said. Yet some state chapters, such as 
the one in California, were only intermittently active and had very little 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
The current "rising star" for the Religious Right, Falwell said, is radio 
broadcaster and author James Dobson of the Pomona-based Focus on the Family 
ministries. Dobson, an ardent foe of abortion, pornography and, last year, the 
controversial film "The Last Temptation of Christ," has begun forming political 
lobbying groups in each state. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson was recently criticized by U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop for 
allegedly giving out misinformation about AIDS. And Dobson was in the news 
early this year when his prison interview with mass murderer Theodore R. Bundy 
-- the final one granted before his execution in Florida -- quoted Bundy as 
pointing to a youthful fascination with hard-core pornography as a factor in 
his path to violent sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Political Activity 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Falwell has reduced his political activity since 1986, when he 
said he would devote more time to his church, TV ministry and his Liberty 
University, which will have 7,000 students in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned as president of Moral Majority in 1987, acknowledging that the name 
had often become a hindrance because critics attacked it as a symbol of 
political and religious intolerance. Falwell stayed as Moral Majority board 
chairman but subsumed it within a larger body he called the Liberty Federation.

MUSEUM WON'T RENEW HAMMER'S BOARD TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said they decided not to renew 
industrialist Armand Hammer's term on their board because he changed his mind 
about donating his art collection to the museum and was focusing on plans for 
his own museum. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has served on the county museum board for the last 20 years. But 
trustees agreed last week to allow his current term to expire June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not coming to meetings," board President Daniel N. Belin said. "He has 
abandoned his commitment to make the gift of his collection." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously his energies at this point are directed to his own museum," said 
Richard E. Sherwood, a member of the board's executive committee and chairman 
of the nominating committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood was referring to a private facility Hammer plans to build in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Belin and Sherwood said Hammer has not attended a board meeting or museum 
function since his abrupt announcement in January, 1988, that he would 
establish his own museum for his Old Master and Impressionist paintings, his 
collection of lithographs and other works by 19th-Century French satirist 
Honore Daumier and a Leonard da Vinci manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer said at the time that he withdrew his plans to give the art to the 
county museum because he did not want the collection displayed in galleries 
named for other donors. Museum officials said Hammer made untenable demands 
that would isolate his collection from the rest of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Belin and Sherwood said they had not heard from Hammer about the board's 
decision to formally sever ties. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hammer nor a spokesman for his Occidental Petroleum Corp. could be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's ties to the county museum had been strong until the recent 
disagreements. One of the museum complex buildings is named for Hammer and his 
wife, Frances. Five major paintings, including a Rembrandt, a Rubens and a 
Modigliani, were donated by the oil magnate. He was instrumental in arranging 
an exhibition of Impressionist and modern paintings from the Soviet Union, 
Belin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infrequent Appearances 
</P>
<P>
Hammer never made frequent appearances at board meetings. But he did attend 
when he wanted to discuss something specific, Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Hammer decided to go ahead with his own museum, he told Belin that 
he hoped the two institutions could sometimes work together. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that if he had any specific ideas, he should present them," Belin 
said. "He hasn't done that." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer also had talked of helping to bring another major exhibit from the 
Soviet Union to the county museum, Belin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard from him about that," he added.

JUSTICES ASKED TO OK FELONY-MURDER PROSECUTIONS IN DRUG-DEATH CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
She had gone to a Santa Ana motel room to inhale "lines" of cocaine and to 
smoke hand-rolled cigarettes made of cocaine and tobacco that are known as 
"coco puffs." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she was sitting in a glassy-eyed stupor from the effects of the illicit 
drug. Her two companions realized she had stopped breathing and took her 
outside for fresh air, but to no avail. When paramedics arrived on the scene, 
they found that Jennie Licerio, age 19, had died from acute cocaine 
intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman's death set the stage for a widely watched test case to be 
argued this week in Los Angeles before the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of state and local prosecutors is asking the justices to permit 
authorities to bring second-degree murder charges against Sandy Patterson, the 
Tustin man they say furnished the drug that killed Licerio. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors want the high court to rule that providing cocaine is an 
"inherently dangerous" act and to overturn previous rulings they say have 
effectively prevented murder prosecutions in cocaine deaths and also have 
imperiled use of such charges in deaths involving heroin and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The case comes before the justices in the wake of reports of massive use of 
cocaine in the United States and a steady increase in the number of deaths 
attributed to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities now estimate that more than 20 million Americans have used cocaine. 
According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a survey of medical 
examiners in 27 metropolitan areas show the number of cocaine-related deaths 
rose last year to 1,582 -- triple the number in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors say the ability to press murder charges for cocaine-related 
deaths would provide a useful weapon against drug trafficking and justly punish 
dealers whose wares prove fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone sells or otherwise furnishes a substance like cocaine, they ought 
to be fully liable when death results," said Thomas J. Borris, an Orange County 
deputy district attorney. "It's just like administering poison." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys backing the defendant in the case argue that while cocaine undeniably 
is a serious national problem, its use has not been shown to be inherently 
dangerous to life. Many more people -- perhaps hundreds of thousands annually 
-- die from cigarettes and alcohol, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Permitting a murder prosecution for merely supplying the drug would unfairly 
impose harsh sentences for wholly unintended results, the lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk in moral terms, it's simply not fair to classify someone as a 
murderer for something that was completely unanticipated and that no reasonable 
person could have foreseen," said state Deputy Public Defender Philip M. 
Brooks. "If these people are drug dealers, let them be prosecuted, but 
prosecute them as drug dealers, not murderers." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1986 when, according to Orange County authorities, Licerio 
and another young woman met Patterson and agreed to go to his motel room, where 
he provided them with cocaine. After Licerio's death, prosecutors charged 
Patterson with furnishing cocaine, a felony, and with second-degree murder in 
the death of Licerio. 
</P>
<P>
California, like most other states, permits murder charges to be brought when 
death results during commission of a felony, even when a killing is unintended 
or accidental. The aim of the felony-murder rule is to deter crime by holding 
criminals strictly liable for the consequences of dangerous and violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
State penal statutes specifically provide for first-degree felony-murder 
prosecutions for killings in a robbery, rape, arson and certain other crimes. 
The punishment for such murders range from 25 years to life in prison or the 
death penalty in some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The courts have also permitted second-degree felony-murder charges when death 
results from a crime found to be "inherently dangerous" to human life. A 1958 
ruling, for example, allowed such charges for furnishing a victim a fatal dose 
of heroin, but later decisions have raised doubt about the validity of such 
prosecutions. The punishment for these second-degree murders is 15 years to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In the case the justices will hear this week, Patterson pleaded guilty to 
furnishing cocaine -- an offense punishable by three to five years in prison. 
But he won dismissal of the murder charge in Orange County Superior Court. A 
state Court of Appeal in Santa Ana upheld the dismissal, saying it had no 
choice under state Supreme Court rulings it said had brought the law "to the 
brink of logical absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
The high court held in 1965 that a felony could be found "inherently 
dangerous," and thus support a second-degree felony-murder charge, only if 
found dangerous when "viewed in the abstract." The justices said it was 
necessary to look at the issue in general terms because if the trial courts 
looked instead to the actual circumstances in cases where the result was death, 
they would almost always find the felony dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Decision 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the justices went further by ruling that murder charges could not be 
brought if the underlying felony that allegedly led to the killing could have 
been committed in a way that was not dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal concluded that, under the rulings, Patterson could 
not be prosecuted for murder. Although he was accused of "furnishing" cocaine, 
the statute under which he was charged could also be violated in ways that were 
not inherently dangerous -- such as "transporting" the drug, the Court of 
Appeal noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we are, of course, bound by these holdings, we find their rationale 
difficult to accept," Appellate Justice Thomas F. Crosby wrote for the panel. 
The second-degree felony-murder rule ought to simply be abolished, or, if 
retained, modified so that trial courts could examine the defendant's actual 
conduct and decide whether it was inherently dangerous, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
In their subsequent appeal of the ruling to the state Supreme Court, Orange 
County authorities have been joined by the state attorney general's office, the 
California District Attorneys Assn. and the Pacific Legal Foundation, a 
conservative public-interest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County prosecutors argue that the current state of the law in 
California allows many otherwise guilty drug suppliers to avoid felony-murder 
charges. Past rulings should be modified to permit trial courts to focus on the 
specific way the statute was violated -- such as furnishing the drug -- and not 
on the alternative ways the statute could have been violated, the prosecutors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Defenders' Support 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Gilbert of Santa Monica, the attorney representing Patterson before the 
high court, is receiving support from the state public defender's office and 
the Orange County public defender's office in urging the justices to uphold the 
Court of Appeal ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson's backers argue that the felony-murder rule is an outdated legal 
concept whose continued existence unfairly punishes unintended killings and 
deprives defendants in such cases of their right to due process of law. The 
rule, they say, should be abandoned. Meanwhile, if someone maliciously uses a 
drug to kill someone, he can be prosecuted directly for murder, the attorneys 
say. 
</P>
<P>
In briefs to the court, Gilbert contends that contrary to the prosecutors' 
contentions, there is insufficient medical evidence to show that cocaine use is 
likely to cause death. The reported deaths from cocaine are "a serious problem 
to be sure, but a statistically insignificant one when one considers that 
millions of persons use the drug," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys on both sides say they cannot predict precisely how many 
felony-murder prosecutions will arise if the justices clear the way for such 
charges against drug dealers. But they note that authorities from throughout 
California have inquired about the case and say that in view of the widespread 
nature of drug use, the number of prosecutions could be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there are a lot of potential cases like this one because drug 
overdoses are an increasing problem in the state," said Michael D. Schwartz, a 
Ventura County prosecutor representing the district attorneys association in 
the case. "Felony murder charges could be an effective tool against the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deterrent Effect 
</P>
<P>
Anthony T. Caso, a lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, said that 
regardless of the actual number of prosecutions, the threat of such charges 
could prove a significant deterrent to drug-pushing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about spending a few years in prison for furnishing a drug 
against a much stiffer term for felony-murder," Caso said. "The drug dealer 
will know that the risk of doing business has gone way up."

1 MILLION MOURNERS FLOCK TO KHOMEINI'S GRAVE

Two Iranians died and thousands fainted as huge crowds flocked to the grave of 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Sunday for a memorial service marking a week 
since his death. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's most powerful leaders were among the more than 1 million mourners at 
Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, 10 miles south of Tehran, according to Iranian press 
reports monitored in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon this site will become a shrine to attract the Muslims of the world," said 
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who broke into tears during his speech. 
"This is a center which radiates heavenly light." 
</P>
<P>
In Islam, the seventh and 40th days after death are considered a time for 
special mourning rites. Free food and drink were distributed around the grave. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's state-run television showed mourners beating their heads and chests with 
clenched fists in the Shiite Muslim expression of grief and chanting, 
"Khomeini, Khomeini, why did you leave us?" 
</P>
<P>
But the atmosphere appeared calmer than during Tuesday's burial, which was 
delayed for six hours after some in the hysterical crowd of 2 million tore 
pieces from Khomeini's white shroud and toppled the body out of its coffin. 
</P>
<P>
The 86-year-old patriarch died June 3 after suffering a heart attack. There 
were eight deaths and 11,000 injuries in the subsequent three days of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, one man died of a heart attack and another died after falling from a 
cargo container used as a stand for television cameras, according to press 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fainting One a Second 
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the mourners were so densely 
packed during the afternoon ceremony that, on average, one person fainted every 
second in temperatures around 96 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing were passed hand over hand to one of 23 mobile medical units 
stationed around the site, and more than 1,000 doctors and medical workers were 
on duty, the news agency reported. More serious injuries were rushed to nearby 
hospitals in one of 250 ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
The television showed a protective barrier made from four metal cargo 
containers to keep crowds away from the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrine Built Overnight 
</P>
<P>
Working through the night, young men from the Reconstruction Crusade had 
hastily had lain cream-colored marble slabs, and a three-tiered shrine had 
sprouted, topped by a huge golden dome and a fluttering black flag. 
</P>
<P>
The dome over Khomeini's grave, already called the Haram-e Sharif after the 
tomb of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed, is based on the famous Dome of the Rock 
mosque in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The actual grave is marked by a small, blank marble slab. 
</P>
<P>
A permanent structure is planned to replace the temporary one erected within 
days of Khomeini's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weeping Mourners 
</P>
<P>
The television showed weeping mourners gripping a metal grille built around the 
structure, trying to touch and kiss the shrine, which they already consider 
sacred. 
</P>
<P>
Those unable to reach it threw clothes and other articles to the guards 
standing on top of the containers. The guards touched them to the shrine and 
threw them back. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a stone heart to stay composed at such a time," Rafsanjani said 
in his speech. Khomeini's 44-year-old son, Ahmed, was reported too overcome to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
A crop-dusting plane sprayed rosewater on the mourners, and helicopters circled 
overhead, showering the crowds with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said crowds began collecting at the grave site Saturday night and 
grew to a throng almost two miles wide. There were unprecedented traffic jams 
on the expressway leading to the cemetery.

The daughter of Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Sunday that her 
father suffered five heart attacks in the 10 days after surgery May 23 for 
stomach cancer. He died June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming that her father had cancer, Zahra Mustafavi said Khomeini died in a 
small clinic near his home in north Tehran, where 40 Iranian physicians debated 
every aspect of his care and where every moment in his final days was recorded 
on a hidden videotaping system. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic was taken over by Khomeini's medical team nine years ago after his 
first serious heart attack and after concerns were raised that he might be the 
target of assassination attempts, for which medical facilities would be needed 
close by, the daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in her Tehran office, Mustafavi, 48, provided the most detailed 
accounting to date of her father's medical problems in recent years during a 
50-minute interview. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that her brother, Ahmed, 44, has aspired since 1981 to become 
president, but the idea was rejected by her father, whom she quoted as saying, 
"As long as I am alive, I do not wish for him to have a position." 
</P>
<P>
Mustafavi said her own desire to become a member of Parliament had to be 
deferred by her father's policy of keeping his children out of political posts 
while he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of her father's death, Mustafavi said, her brother has sunk into a 
dejected mental state, from which she attempted to jar him Saturday with a pep 
talk after she had heard that he wanted to withdraw from active participation 
in national affairs. She quoted him as saying, "I am too tired. . . . I am 
finished," but he added that he has not given up on the Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Hinting that Iranian-U.S. relations, frozen by bitter grievances on both sides, 
might improve after her father's death, she said Khomeini "always said the 
relationship between America and Iran is like a relationship between a wolf and 
a sheep, but officials change." 
</P>
<P>
Mustafavi, a university lecturer and women's society organizer, answered 
questions in the presence of a Foreign Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
She joined other influential Iranians in praising the selection of Ali Khamenei 
as Iran's new spiritual leader, saying her family is "really happy" about the 
choice.

PEACE BID VIEWED AS INSINCERE, EGYPTIAN REPORTEDLY TELLS ISRAEL

A visiting senior Egyptian official told Israel on Sunday that Arab states and 
the PLO view Israel's peace initiative as insincere, Israeli sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit by Butros Butros Ghali, deputy foreign minister, was the 
first to Israel by a high-ranking Egyptian since the Palestinian uprising 
erupted in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at his meeting with Israeli Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres quoted 
Butros Ghali as saying: "The feeling is widespread in the Arab world that the 
initiative is not serious and aimed merely at gaining time." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli peace initiative, endorsed by the government but criticized by 
hard-liners in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rightist Likud Party, calls for 
Palestinians in the occupied areas to elect negotiators for peace talks with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress With Arafat 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 12 months, we have made not inconsiderable achievements with 
(Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser) Arafat. Now it is up to 
Israel to make its move," the sources quoted Butros Ghali as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The army lifted a weeklong curfew from most areas of the Gaza Strip just hours 
before Butros Ghali arrived. An Arab youth shot by troops during protests in 
the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp died of his wounds Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Butros Ghali told Peres that Israel will have to provide more details of the 
proposed Palestinian elections to attract an Arab partner, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian said Shamir's hard-line statements that he would not allow 
international supervision of the vote, or the participation of East Jerusalem 
Arabs, does not inspire confidence among Arabs that Israel is sincere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commitment to Peace 
</P>
<P>
Israeli commentators said Butros Ghali's visit underlines Cairo's commitment to 
peace with Israel, just two weeks after Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League 
following a 10-year suspension over its 1979 treaty with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian diplomats said Butros Ghali will try to persuade Israeli leaders that 
last month's Arab summit in Casablanca adopted moderate resolutions on the 
Arab-Israeli conflict that offer a basis for a comprehensive peace.

REFUGEES IN PRIMITIVE CAMP, SOVIETS SAY

Ethnic rioting that has killed about 100 people in the Uzbekistan republic has 
driven nearly 15,000 refugees into a camp where living conditions are so 
primitive that women give birth on the ground, Soviet media said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The most explosive situation is here, in the refugee camp," for Meskhetians 
(minority Turks), said a report on the television news program "Vremya." 
</P>
<P>
The military newspaper Red Star said mobs of intoxicated residents continue to 
direct violence against Meskhetians in the republic's Fergana region. 
</P>
<P>
"The green colors of Fergana do not cover the remains of burned-out homes that 
belonged to Turks not so long ago," the newspaper said. "In some places of the 
region, clouds of smoke are visible. Numerous are the crowds made up of drunks 
and people high on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the violence in the region, about 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, has 
been directed at the Meskhetians, a minority group uprooted by dictator Josef 
Stalin in 1944 from its homeland in Soviet Georgia and forcibly resettled in 
the Soviet East. 
</P>
<P>
Red Star said that about 100 people were killed in the first days of the 
weeklong rioting and about 1,000 other people were wounded. According to Red 
Star, 136 Interior Ministry soldiers have been injured since the disturbances 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the city of Fergana, the government newspaper Izvestia said, about 
14,500 people who have fled their homes are housed under guard in a refugee 
camp in blistering heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are hard in the camp," it said. "Some of the 20 babies born in the 
past week were delivered on the bare ground." 
</P>
<P>
According to Izvestia, a 200-bed field hospital has been set up at the camp to 
treat wounded Turks who left hospitals in Fergana because they were afraid to 
stay there. 
</P>
<P>
But Izvestia quoted Lt. Col. N. Usmanov of the Interior Ministry as saying that 
about 20 of the refugees have begun a hunger strike demanding to be taken out 
of Central Asia altogether. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the refugees, interviewed on "Vremya," demanded "immediate 
evacuation . . . (to) save our people." 
</P>
<P>
Red Star said the decision has been made to evacuate women and children from 
the camp and that 400 people have already been airlifted to a children's camp 
operated by the Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
From Sunday's Soviet press, it was clear that the violence was continuing 
despite the presence of 9,000 Interior Ministry troops sent to restore order. 
But the reasons for the outburst, which officials said began as an ethnic 
dispute between Turks and the dominant native population, the Uzbeks, were 
still unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Red Star quoted Col. E. Nechaeyv, deputy chief of the political department of 
Interior Ministry troops, as saying: "We think that the extremists' actions are 
guided by interested leaders with mercenary goals, which they use vile methods 
to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin on Saturday blamed the rampage on outside 
agitators who came pouring into the valley in cars and trucks. He called them 
opponents of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, which have brought a 
crackdown against corruption in Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is absolutely clear," Bakatin told the Soviet Culture newspaper. 
"Evil forces that want to destabilize the situation . . . are behind these 
events." But he said he could not yet determine who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
At Kimyagar settlement, five miles from the city of Kokand, young people who 
arrived in cars smashed kiosks and shop windows on Saturday, attacking people 
who tried to stop them, the labor daily Trud said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the young rioters were detained and some admitted that on the eve of 
their attack, instigators from Kokand came and threatened to set their homes 
ablaze if they did not set out for Kimyagar. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trud report did not explain why the instigators wanted the Turks 
attacked.

BEIJING'S NEW TARGET: THE FAX MACHINE

<TEXT>
<P>
China's apparatus of political repression took aim Sunday at one of the 
principal tools of the pro-democracy movement: the fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese government radio broadcasts monitored by Hong Kong Chinese here 
asserted that police and security officials are now sitting by and keeping 
watch on all the fax machines inside China. The implication was that any 
resident of China who shows up to receive material faxed from Hong Kong or 
anywhere else outside China could get into serious political trouble. 
</P>
<P>
For good measure, Chinese radio broadcasts also ordered all citizens to turn in 
to authorities all the Hong Kong newspapers they have in their possession. Hong 
Kong newspapers should not be found lying around the homes or apartments of 
people inside China, the government broadcasts warned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort to Limit Information 
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts represent the strongest effort yet to limit the information that 
the Chinese people receive from outside the country. They also illustrate the 
way China's security apparatus is now scrambling to cope with modern technology 
as it carries out an old-fashioned political crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the past few weeks, many fax machines inside China have been running 
virtually non-stop. Residents of Hong Kong, in particular, have been sending in 
messages of support, as well as news and copies of foreign press coverage of 
the events inside China. 
</P>
<P>
"Fax Saves Lives," says one sticker plastered onto virtually every lamppost in 
this politically charged city. 
</P>
<P>
Fax machines at Hong Kong University here are said to have been used to provide 
important logistical and organizational support for the pro-democracy movement 
inside China when it was at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
From a political standpoint, the advantage of the fax machine is that it is 
relatively secure. It is much harder to intercept fax messages than it is to 
eavesdrop on telephone calls or to monitor conversations inside a room through 
electronic bugs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Chinese security officials intercept the signal from one fax machine to 
another, diplomats say, they would not be able to decipher it unless they are 
actually present to take the paper as it comes out of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
That is what the Chinese radio broadcasts suggested that the police are trying 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know how many fax machines there are inside China. During the 
past few years, many of them have been brought in by private companies, 
universities, research institutes and state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the police say they are monitoring every fax machine in China is 
ridiculous," one Western diplomat said here Sunday. "They couldn't possibly 
keep track of every fax machine in China every day." 
</P>
<P>
Among the materials most frequently transmitted by facsimile from Hong Kong 
into China have been copies of news articles in the Hong Kong press. According 
to Sunday's radio broadcasts, these are now considered off-limits to ordinary 
Chinese, either in their facsimile form or in their original newsprint 
versions. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, even those Hong Kong newspapers supposedly 
controlled by the Chinese government have turned against the regime and 
published scathingly critical stories about the events in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Since the June 4 massacre in Beijing, the Wen Hui Bao -- which was for decades 
one of the leading pro-Communist newspapers in Hong Kong -- has switched the 
color of its masthead from red to black. In a June 5 editorial, the newspaper 
said that the hard-line faction of the Chinese Communist Party led by Premier 
Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun were "thieves" who had completely turned 
against the Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the newspaper published two front-page pictures of Chinese troops 
beating young people. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Wen Hui Bao and two other Hong Kong newspapers affiliated with 
the Chinese Communist Party were distributed liberally in China. Now, according 
to Sunday's radio broadcasts, residents of China are being told not to read 
them. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what will happen to the newspapers, which are believed to get 
financing from the Chinese government.

STUDENT ARRESTED AT AIRPORT AFTER SEEKING HELP FROM BRITISH CONSULATE

Authorities detained a Hong Kong Chinese student attempting to board a flight 
home from Shanghai's airport Sunday, and there were clear signals that China's 
leaders are also expanding their campaign of political intimidation from 
Beijing to provincial cities. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the student, Yao Yongzhan, 19, was reported on 
government-controlled Shanghai Television Sunday evening along with accounts of 
raids on a local political party, a dissident association and an underground 
labor organization. 
</P>
<P>
Yao, whose name is rendered Yiu Yung Chin in Cantonese and who also is known as 
Zhang Cai on Shanghai campuses, feared arrest for his participation in the 
pro-democracy student movement and contacted the Shanghai British Consulate for 
assistance in leaving China, a spokesman for the Foreign Office in London said. 
A British diplomat escorted Yao to the airport Sunday afternoon, but the 
student was taken into custody while going through an immigration check, the 
Foreign Office spokesman said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's official Wen Hui Bao newspaper reported today that Yao was a leader 
of the city's outlawed Autonomous Student Union. He was arrested for carrying 
"forbidden things" and failing to abide by a municipal decree requiring student 
activists to register with authorities, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Incident 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in a week that Chinese authorities had detained a Hong 
Kong resident who was trying to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, a labor activist was apprehended while boarding a special charter 
flight that was evacuating Hong Kong residents from Beijing. The activist, an 
ethnic Chinese who had reportedly brought $260,000 in donations for 
pro-democracy demonstrators, was allowed to return home later in the week after 
undergoing questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Chinese travel in China on special visitors' permits, not passports, 
and have only limited rights to diplomatic protection from the British, who 
acknowledge Chinese sovereignty over the colony and plan to turn it over to 
Beijing in 1997 with assurances that the political system will remain free and 
autonomous under Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
In Yao's case, however, British authorities are treating the incident "as if he 
were holding a British passport," said Martin Lee, a member of Hong Kong's 
legislative council. Hong Kong authorities registered an immediate complaint 
with the New China News Agency, Beijing's de facto diplomatic mission in the 
colony, and the British Embassy in Beijing has made inquiries with the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Yao, a third-year student at Shanghai's Fudan 
University, would face formal charges. But hundreds of others rounded up over 
the past few days, in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities, are being accused of 
"counterrevolutionary" activities in connection with the student-led democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Interrogation 
</P>
<P>
Local and national television broadcasts showed scenes of dissidents being led 
into procurators' offices Sunday with their heads bowed as they underwent 
interrogation by finger-wagging officials. 
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest city and its most important industrial center, two 
men belonging to the China Youth Democratic Party, an illegal opposition party, 
were hauled in front of the camera and accused of plotting to overthrow the 
Communist regime. Another man associated with the "Freedom Association," 
apparently a dissident political organization, was shown being booked on 
charges of spreading counterrevolutionary propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filmed Under Detention 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, several members of the Shanghai Autonomous Worker's Union were 
filmed under detention, including at least four women. Student activists say 
the nine founding members of the union were nabbed Friday after participating 
in a pro-democracy demonstration in central Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
Three leaders of a similar autonomous union in Beijing were detained by public 
security officials on May 29, but they were released two days later after 
vociferous protests by students and fellow workers. Members of that union who 
survived the bloody military assault on Tian An Men Square, where they had 
joined student squatters, are believed to have been arrested in the sweeping 
roundup that took place at the end of last week. 
</P>
<P>
Exact numbers of arrests were impossible to ascertain as of Sunday, but China's 
official news media have reported arrests of at least 589 people suspected of 
resisting the military in Beijing a week ago, among other counterrevolutionary 
offenses. Also detained were about 130 people who allegedly set up bus 
barricades in a civil disobedience campaign that paralyzed Shanghai traffic for 
the first three days of last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a deadline set by Shanghai student protesters for concessions by the 
city government passed Sunday without incident, suggesting that the protest 
movement had gone underground as its leaders had previously indicated it would. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subdued and Deserted 
</P>
<P>
The campuses of the two university campuses at the vanguard of the democracy 
movement in Shanghai were subdued and virtually deserted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At Fudan University, a mock funeral tent erected by students at the base of a 
huge granite statue of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung had been taken down -- 
although a replica of the Beijing students' "Goddess of Democracy" was left 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
Handbills describing events in Beijing and facsimile copies of Hong Kong 
Chinese newspaper articles that were plastered across the city for the last 
week were scraped off bulletin boards at East China Normal University. 
</P>
<P>
Assembled by the university gates, along the major avenues and near People's 
Square -- the site of Friday's protest rally -- were squads of middle-aged 
worker "volunteer guards" wearing tractor caps. The Shanghai government had 
hired them -- according to one Chinese source, at the relatively generous rate 
of $5 a shift -- off factory lines to help maintain public order. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the volunteers appeared to be an attempt by city authorities 
to demonstrate they are in control of the streets while at the same time 
reassure the public they need not fear intervention by the military. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Confirmed Reports 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the situation before the massacre in Beijing, there have been no 
confirmed reports that army units are positioned near the city. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, many observers say a military occupation of Shanghai, where anger 
toward the government is lurking beneath a passive surface, would prove to be 
disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
"If they placed troops in the center of Shanghai, it would bring the city to a 
screeching halt," said an American businessman based here for several years. 
"Since Shanghai accounts for some 20% of China's industrial output, they can't 
afford that. They have no choice but to take a very cautious approach."

The U.S. ambassador to China said Sunday that despite current tensions between 
the United States and China over last weekend's bloody crushing of the 
pro-democracy movement in Beijing, it would be a "terrible mistake" to abandon 
the relationship between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through many ups and downs with China, and I think right now we're 
going through a down," Ambassador James R. Lilley said from Beijing in an 
interview broadcast on CBS-TV. "But I don't think we should sort of give up on 
it; I think that would be a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Lilley said the Chinese leadership was battling for control of the country and 
that U.S. comments and actions would have little impact in the midst of the 
crisis. He said the United States could exert influence through Voice of 
America broadcasts, day-to-day business dealings and the training of Chinese 
students at American universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflected Cautious Stance 
</P>
<P>
Lilley's remarks on "Face the Nation" reflected the cautious stance toward the 
Chinese crisis adopted by policy-makers in Washington.

<P>
President Bush, while cutting off all government and private military sales to 
Beijing last week, has refrained from sharply criticizing the Chinese 
government. He has not threatened to cut all economic and diplomatic ties to 
China, nor has he recalled Lilley as a sign of U.S. displeasure at the massacre 
and arrests of student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Lilley, echoing Bush's moderate language, said: "At the moment, you have an 
overwhelming desire (by Chinese leaders) for survival, and that takes 
precedence over anything. What we do is we play for the long term, and we don't 
look for a quick fix -- a 'feelie-goodie' about this thing. We look for a 
long-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
Lilley declined to discuss what the United States plans to do about Fang Lizhi, 
China's most prominent dissident, who has been given refuge in the U.S. Embassy 
in Beijing since last Monday. The ambassador said he had had talks in the past 
several days with senior Chinese officials about Fang, but he would not reveal 
the content of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best to Shut Up' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sensitive thing and it's best to do it and shut up," Lilley said. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said he hopes the confrontation over Fang can be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want irritants in the Chinese-American relationship," Lilley 
said. "But we Americans stand for certain things, and I don't think we're going 
to change. And I think the Chinese stand for certain things and they're not 
going to change. And then you strike a deal." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's moderate approach does not sit well with many members 
of Congress. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), reflecting broad sentiment in 
Congress for stiffer sanctions against the Chinese government, called for a 
halt in high-technology exports and for multilateral efforts to press China to 
end repression of the student pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly an immediate cutoff or break in relations or all economic trade, I 
think, would have been precipitous," D'Amato said on "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Business as Usual' 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got to let the Chinese Communist leaders, those old fellows who are 
clinging to power, understand there is not going to be business as usual, that 
there will be economic sanctions, that there will be a curtailment of our 
normal relations," said D'Amato, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
"And we've got to lead the world community in this direction." 
</P>
<P>
But Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, interviewed 
on the same program, said the United States should think twice before imposing 
harsh economic penalties on China. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made it very, very clear by those pictures (of students being beaten 
by security forces) and by their statements and by their actions . . . that 
they really don't care what world opinion is," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be careful that in trying to punish this government -- we're 
certainly not going to influence it -- we do not unintentionally and 
inadvertently create a situation where it's going to be more difficult or 
impossible to rebuild this relationship when it becomes possible to do so."

URBAN WARRIORS IN THE DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS ARE INCREASINGLY MAKING THEIR PRESENCE FELT IN THE GROWING CITIES OF 
PALMDALE AND LANCASTER, FORCING OFFICIALS TO FIGHT AN UNEXPECTED BATTLE.

<P>
Gangs have come to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti on the sun-baked walls of the Antelope Valley proclaim the invasion of 
urban warriors from far-off battlegrounds: "Crenshaw Mafia Crips," "San Fers," 
"Grape Street Watts," "Pomona 12th Street," "Bloodstone Village." 
</P>
<P>
A white youth from Palmdale, arrested after an armed robbery attempt last week, 
declared that he belonged to the 107 Hoover Crips, a street gang from a 
neighborhood 70 miles away where Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said he 
wouldn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
Billboards trumpeting the local housing boom among landscapes of sagebrush and 
Joshua trees will soon be joined by the Antelope Valley's first public service 
billboard messages warning against gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
These are the signs of the social realities that accompany one of the fastest 
growth rates in the state. Along with prosperity, the urbanization of the 
Antelope Valley has produced a high-desert version of inner-city gang culture. 
The problem has not reached crisis proportions, but its rise over the last two 
years has local communities fighting a battle they did not expect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
90 Gangs Identified 
</P>
<P>
Deputies in the area's brand-new gang intelligence unit say they have 
identified members of at least 90 gangs from around Los Angeles County in the 
Antelope Valley. That includes about a half-dozen local gangs, officials say. 
They place the number of gang members in the valley at 400, a multi-ethnic 
group that encompasses concentric categories of hard-core members, "associates" 
and "wanna-bes." 
</P>
<P>
These numbers should be viewed in the context of the size of the area policed 
by the Sheriff's Department -- about 1,300 square miles stretching up to the 
Kern County line and including vast expanses of uninhabited land. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's population increase of 17% to 45,900 residents led the county last 
year. Lancaster's population grew 10% to 82,200. Much of the gang activity is 
concentrated in and around those two cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had anything approaching the level of violence we're used to seeing 
in the central city," said Deputy Frank Ramirez, head of the three-man gang 
unit. "But they're here. The gang problem is partly imported. You have Crips 
and Bloods expanding to places like Denver, Washington, Chicago. And they're 
also expanding to places like Ontario, Rialto. It's the drug market." 
</P>
<P>
Drug dealing controlled by Crip and Blood networks from the Los Angeles area 
has surged in Antelope Valley parks, motels and apartments. There have been at 
least two gang-related shootings in the last eight months. Robberies, assaults, 
burglaries and other crimes are being traced to street gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say their research shows the number of gang-related incidents 
in the schools and community -- ranging from graffiti to fights to robberies -- 
is up about 45% this year over last year's total of 4,473 incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to drug activity, another economic factor has helped spawn the 
gangs. Housing prices are pushing low-income families to the edges of the 
county. Parents who have sacrificed in order to move their children away from 
inner-city influences are discovering that the children have brought the 
influences along. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Facade of Toughness 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders say youths who were on the fringes of gangs in other areas 
are trying to appear tough in what they consider hick territory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a lot of wanna-be types," said Forrest McElroy, superintendent 
of the Palmdale Elementary School District. "You have some folks moving in from 
environments that were not the best. That's not to dwell on it being imported, 
because we certainly have problem kids of our own." 
</P>
<P>
Many newcomers and longtime residents are stunned. They moved to the county's 
fringes in search of affordable housing and safe streets. They wanted to get 
far away, physically and psychologically, from the areas south of the 40-mile 
mountain stretch of the Antelope Valley Freeway that begins near Santa Clarita 
-- "down below," as locals call it. 
</P>
<P>
Some alarmed residents have overreacted, sometimes being quick to report "gang 
fights" when they see altercations involving young blacks or Latinos who do not 
have gang connections. 
</P>
<P>
But Beverly Louw, principal of Desert Winds Continuation High School in 
Lancaster, said: "We've become more sophisticated. We're educating the 
community to identify the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Louw is applying for $200,000 in state funds to set up a comprehensive 
anti-gang program. The schools have implemented stern new policies against gang 
affiliation and wearing colors or other symbols. They also have brought in 
experts to educate faculty and students and toughened school security. 
</P>
<P>
The cities have also responded vigorously. Sheriff's deputies, who patrol 
Palmdale and Lancaster, have been saturating parks and drug-dealing locations 
with aggressive patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the drug and gang activity has been concentrated in Palmdale, where two 
gang members were wounded last November in a shooting in a K-mart parking lot. 
City officials there have mounted an offensive involving government, schools 
and business. This year's budget calls for adding seven new officers to the 36 
who now patrol Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lancaster's Response 
</P>
<P>
In response to increasing violence at parks, the Lancaster City Council 
recently approved earlier park closing times. The council will soon consider a 
budget proposal to pay for adding two new deputies to the Sheriff Department's 
gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
The three deputies already serving on the anti-gang detail are veterans of such 
hot spots as Lynwood and East Los Angeles, and are still getting to know their 
new terrain. They are "putting together the puzzle" of how many gangs and gang 
members really exist in the valley, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent Friday night cruise in their unmarked car, Deputies Carl Thomas 
and Steve Gutierrez explained that gang turf and allegiances are still being 
defined by the youths. The main potential for violence will come as that 
process continues. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas grew up in Palmdale. When he was in high school 10 years ago, well 
before the wave of developers and house-hunters swept up the freeway, he knew 
youths who called themselves Crips, but "it was all talk." 
</P>
<P>
But on this recent night, as Thomas and Gutierrez continued cruising the town, 
they came across some Crips driving a car with expired registration tags that 
were more than just talk. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas and Gutierrez advanced cautiously, big men made bigger by bulletproof 
vests and green sheriff's jackets, hands near their guns. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me see some hands," Gutierrez said, and a forest of arms sprouted from the 
car windows. Once the five occupants were on the sidewalk, the deputies 
relaxed. They talked to Li'l Loco and Li'l T-Macc, who wore white T-shirts, 
sagging pants and tattoos designating allegiance to Sintown 357, a Pomona set. 
</P>
<P>
Both have records of arrests for assault. They said they were just passing 
through Palmdale; T-Macc had an appointment with a probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disdain for Locals 
</P>
<P>
Neither Loco nor T-Macc think much of the local talent. They describe them as 
"busters," an epithet meaning wimp or sissy. 
</P>
<P>
That opinion is shared by Skimp, a Blood originally from Pacoima who claims to 
have left his wild days behind since his family moved to semi-rural Lake Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies dropped in on Skimp as he slouched handcuffed in the Antelope 
Valley station after his arrest during a drug raid at a Palmdale mobile home 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Crips predominate in Palmdale, but Skimp said: "I'm not worried about 
walking around up here. These Crips up here is cowards. If these Crips up here 
wanted some drama, I'd show it to 'em. Give 'em hell. This is like a vacation 
compared to what I'm used to." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives confiscated two ounces of cocaine, three shotguns and two handguns 
in the trailer and arrested three adults and two juveniles along with 
17-year-old Skimp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stop in Subdivision 
</P>
<P>
Later, the deputies' unmarked car pulled into a wholesome-looking subdivision 
and stopped in front of a large house. The garage door was half-open; the 
deputies called hello, and the door swung up to reveal two men and three youths 
-- sunglasses, shirts buttoned to the throat cholo-style, combed-back hair. 
</P>
<P>
One teen-ager greeted the deputies, then headed down the driveway. His father 
emerged from the garage, a shirtless man in sunglasses with a Marine tattoo on 
his arm. 
</P>
<P>
The father -- who asked not to be identified -- told the deputies he is happy 
to report that his son is going into the Army next week. 
</P>
<P>
The family has moved from East Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley, to the 
Santa Clarita area, to here. And the gang life followed his son; deputies say 
the house is a gathering spot for an active valley-born gang, an ethnically 
mixed group that is into burglary, auto theft, vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"That boy," the father said with a barrio lilt. "He's easily led, I can't pull 
him away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Recognized 
</P>
<P>
Other parents have expressed similar despair at what appears to be an 
inexorable phenomenon. The arrival of gangs has presented the down side of the 
area's much-heralded growth, Lancaster Mayor Lynn Harrison said, particularly 
among old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrison and others say the community has recognized the problem in time to 
stop it. They think the Antelope Valley can be different. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably have this kind of thing happening all over the country," Harrison 
said. "A former rural community suffering from all the urban ills. No community 
in the nation is insulated from these kinds of influences. . . . But the 
feeling of a small town is still here, and that's what's going to galvanize the 
citizens into helping out."

SUCCESS OF STRIKE BY L.A. TEACHERS FELT ACROSS U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles teachers strike is over, but the ripples from it are being felt 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
A plan for power-sharing between teachers and administrators and a pay increase 
that will bring top salaries to nearly $54,000 by next year have elicited keen 
interest among educators as far away as Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
In districts closer to home, teachers' union leaders are using Los Angeles as 
an example to encourage members to hold firm to their collective-bargaining 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
"The (reaction) is beginning to astound me," said United Teachers-Los Angeles 
President Wayne Johnson, who has received dozens of telegrams and telephone 
calls from teachers' groups seeking tactical advice and information on the 
power-sharing proposal. "We may have raised the expectations of other 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nine-Day Strike 
</P>
<P>
The 22,000-member Los Angeles teachers' union went on strike for nine days in 
May, virtually shutting down education on most of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's 600 campuses. The new agreement, the final wording of which 
is still being negotiated, calls for a three-year, 24% pay raise retroactive to 
June, 1988, and the creation of school decision-making councils, of which half 
the members will be teachers. In addition, the contract contains provisions to 
eliminate yard duty for elementary school teachers and give elementary 
instructors 40 minutes of paid preparation time a day. 
</P>
<P>
Although some smaller districts already offer better teacher salaries than Los 
Angeles, and a few -- notably Florida's Dade County Public Schools -- are years 
ahead in experimenting with power-sharing, analysts say that what happens in 
Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, merits attention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receive Attention 
</P>
<P>
"Anything done in Los Angeles . . . will automatically get attention 
nationwide, not only because Los Angeles is so large but because it is so 
troubled and the challenge is so great," said Adam Urbanski, the president of 
the Rochester, N.Y., teachers' association, who is widely respected for his 
role in crafting a landmark contract that boosted salaries for some teachers to 
$70,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he added, "everyone will be watching very carefully to see if 
shared governance can work in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"The assumed understanding is, if it can work in Los Angeles, it can work 
anywhere," Urbanski said. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of pay, Los Angeles has the highest teacher salaries among the state's 
big-city districts, including San Francisco and Oakland, and ranks in the top 
5% of districts nationally, according to James Guthrie, a UC Berkeley education 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said he is not surprised that some school superintendents and board 
members are worried that the Los Angeles salaries will lead to unrealistic 
demands from teachers in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
"It will lead to what many people see as very high salaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the average salary increase won in collective bargaining by teachers 
this year was about 5%, according to the California Teachers Assn. The Los 
Angeles agreement calls for an 8% retroactive raise in the current school year 
and 8% in 1989-90 and in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the state's more than 1,000 school districts are still deadlocked 
in negotiations, mainly over monetary issues. Ray Tolcacher, president of the 
Assn. of California School Administrators, said the Los Angeles strike has made 
bargaining over salaries more difficult in those districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bulletin Issued 
</P>
<P>
For example, in San Jose, which has been mired in contract talks for more than 
a year, the teachers' union last week issued a bulletin to its members 
trumpeting "The Los Angeles (UTLA) Success Story." It gave details of the 
salary increase won in Los Angeles and urged San Jose union members to prepare 
for their own strike. The union is asking for a 7% raise, and the district has 
offered 4.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of what happened down south," said San Jose Teachers' Assn. 
President Roger Evans, "we realized maybe the district does have money. And we 
realized that our proposal is an extremely modest proposal. Our members paid 
very close attention to what happened in Los Angeles, and they are holding 
firm." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose Schools Supt. Hilda Beck said the Los Angeles strike has had "a very 
detrimental effect, not only here but throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
"All of the information put out by the (San Jose teachers') union says if L.A. 
can do it, we can do it. It just makes the situation more difficult to handle," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some education analysts say the call for decision-making councils in every 
district school is the most impressive aspect of the Los Angeles contract and a 
major breakthrough for a district that generally had been perceived as another 
big-city school system applying conventional solutions to huge problems of 
student dropouts, campus crime and disillusioned teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Time 
</P>
<P>
"This part of the negotiations will be followed by teachers in the rest of the 
country for the rest of the century," said Jewell Gould, research director of 
the American Federation of Teachers in Washington. "This marks the first time 
there has been a real strong resolution in a contract of parental and teacher 
involvement in school decision-making committees. We're going to see things out 
of L.A. that will help the rest of the nation and help solve problems in places 
like Chicago and Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher unions in other large urban districts, such as New York, Chicago and 
Miami, have contractual agreements with their districts for power-sharing with 
administrators, but Gould said the Los Angeles plan is potentially more 
sweeping. It calls for establishing the councils at all district schools, 
instead of in a small pilot group, and principals will not have veto power. 
</P>
<P>
District and union negotiators were hoping to finish fine-tuning the wording of 
the contract provisions on the power-sharing councils by today. So far, both 
sides have agreed on several key points that give the new councils broader 
powers than other school committees have had. 
</P>
<P>
Most existing school committees, such as the bilingual education councils on 
many campuses, act in an advisory role only. Currently, the only committee with 
decision-making authority is the "school site council," which operates on about 
half of the district's campuses and has the power to decide how to spend 
special state money alloted for school improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union Members 
</P>
<P>
The new councils will have authority over decisions affecting student 
discipline, some budget matters, scheduling and access to certain equipment, 
such as photocopying machines. All teachers, regardless of whether they are 
union members, will be eligible to vote and serve on the councils, and 
decisions will be made by majority vote. Half the members must be teachers, 
while parents, community members and staff, including the principal, will 
occupy the remaining seats. 
</P>
<P>
Although control over the photocopying machine may strike some as a trivial 
concern, teachers say it represents an important symbol of their lack of 
authority to exert influence over the most basic aspects of their jobs. With 
shortages of books and other lesson materials, teachers say the machines are 
crucial but are often broken and their use restricted by some administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"It is symbolic of the intensity of the problem," UC Berkeley's Guthrie said.

BACK-TO-BACK FIRES DAMAGE ANALYST'S PRIMAL INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Primal Institute, the West Los Angeles headquarters of psychologist Arthur 
Janov, who attracted national attention in the 1970s with his theory that 
"primal screaming" can cure childhood neuroses, was ravaged Sunday by 
back-to-back fires, one of which has been ruled arson. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department officials said the blazes, which caused an 
estimated $475,000 in damage and injured a firefighter who was struck by a 
broken hose, began in different parts of the building at 2215 S. Colby Ave. 
They were unrelated, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
"The other fire was out," said Battalion Chief Chuck Merriman, whose 
firefighters fought the second blaze. "We don't leave them before they're out. 
It's very suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the first blaze, which broke out at about 12:30 a.m. and was 
brought under control within half an hour, was deliberately set by an arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
The second fire, reported at 6:55 a.m. and put out shortly before 8 a.m., has 
been labeled "suspicious," and arson investigators said Sunday that they found 
flammable liquids, indicating that fire may have also been deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they know of no motive for the fires, and no one from the Primal 
Institute would comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who firefighters identified as Janov's wife declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Janov, himself, could not be reached. The psychologist developed primal therapy 
in 1967 and his book, "The Primal Scream," gained acclaim four years later when 
hundreds of people, including former Beatle John Lennon and actor James Earl 
Jones, adopted his theories in an attempt to unearth their childhood neuroses 
by venting their rage through screaming.

KIN OF MURDER VICTIM SPOT SUSPECT; MAN JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of raping and shooting two women and a teen-age girl in their 
Inglewood home nine days ago was arrested after relatives of one victim, who 
was killed in the attack, spotted him as they drove to a funeral home to view 
the woman's body. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers arrested J.C. Metoyer, 19, in the Crenshaw District 
about 6 p.m. Saturday. He was being held without bail at the Inglewood Police 
Department jail on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and rape. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police said they received calls throughout the day Saturday from 
Crenshaw-area residents who said they had spotted Metoyer after a photo of the 
reputed gang member was displayed by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
The final sighting was made by the family of a 19-year-old woman, who was 
killed in the June 3 attack that also sent a 33-year-old woman and her 
14-year-old daughter to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The relatives flagged down a Los Angeles police car shortly after spotting 
Metoyer on Crenshaw Boulevard, Inglewood Police Sgt. Bill Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Metoyer was unarmed and offered no resistance when officers approached him 
moments later in the 4700 block of Crenshaw, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that early on the morning of June 3, a gunman forced his way into a 
home on Doty Avenue where the two women and the 14-year-old lived with two 
younger children. 
</P>
<P>
The intruder ordered the two women and the teen-ager to undress, then bound 
them and sexually assaulted them. He then ransacked the home, throwing 
valuables in a pillowcase, before herding the victims together and shooting 
each several times, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the mother and daughter, who are recovering, were able to identify 
Metoyer.

SHUT DOWN THE DIPLOMA MILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California has an unfortunate reputation as a haven for diploma mills, which 
are schools that award degrees for little or no work. They cheapen the value of 
legitimate degrees, prey on the gullible and defraud employers who fall for the 
phony credentials. Legislation in Sacramento that would help curb these diploma 
mills deserves support. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills) is sponsoring SB 190, which would 
overhaul the licensing procedures for unaccredited universities and independent 
trade schools. One of these schools, for example, offers advanced degrees in 
the martial arts through correspondence courses and grants as many as 60 
credits for past "life experiences." Another offers degrees in business 
administration, computer science, engineering, health services, public 
administration and psychology, yet has only one full-time faculty member. For 
their independent course work, says Morgan, students pay $3,600 a year in 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 directory published in Sacramento lists 177 unaccredited degree-granting 
programs in California, issuing among them about 1,200 doctorates each year, 
compared with 2,000 from accredited private institutions such as Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's bill, which may come up today on the Senate floor, doesn't affect 
schools like Stanford that have their programs evaluated by the Western Assn. 
of Schools and Colleges. It would affect the nonaccredited universities that 
are now overseen by a division of the state Department of Education or the 
trade schools supervised by the Department of Consumer Affairs, neither of 
which has expertise in higher education. The bill would create a California 
Council for Private Postsecondary Education expressly to check such schools. It 
would be financed by increasing license fees for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Unaccredited trade schools enroll about one-third of the people who have 
defaulted on their student loans since 1979. Their courses fail to equip 
students for the job market and leave them with debts they cannot pay; at a 
minimum, closer supervision might help reduce loan defaults. Many unaccredited 
schools make their principal income from students in foreign countries, who 
cannot be expected to know much about American accrediting systems and degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some diploma mills grant degrees in pharmacology or counseling but 
require little legitimate course work. SB 190 would help protect the health of 
employers and consumers who may be unaware that some diplomas come with little 
to go with them except a frame. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's bill deserves passage.

STEELY MOTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American steel industry, protected by so-called voluntary import restraints 
for almost five years, is mounting a massive campaign to extend for another 
five years these limits on competition. Protectionism is indeed addictive. And, 
like so many addictive substances, it also is unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Congressmen, led by their rust-belt colleagues, have been rushing to sign on as 
sponsors of legislation extending the restraints when they expire at the end of 
September. That is a sign of the lingering illusion that protectionism buys 
jobs and prosperity. It does not. All it does is discourage and postpone the 
modernization and commitment to competitiveness that are essential for the 
future growth and development of American industry. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is being waged in the guise of assuring fair trade, and of 
punishing foreign forces that are charged with subsidizing their own industries 
and dumping the products on the world market. That is a hollow argument. Rules 
already exist to protect American manufacturers from dumping and unfair 
practices, as is evident in the new actions being taken by the American 
government under the omnibus trade act of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some steel makers acknowledge that they have no need now for the protection of 
the import restrictions because foreign producers are shipping substantially 
less than the 20% of market that they are allowed to fill under the plan. But 
the steel makers argue that a downturn of world markets will inevitably see a 
flood of underpriced foreign steel masking its way to the U.S. market. So they 
want to be ready. And they want to be ready with the quick and easy instrument 
of quotas rather than the slower process using anti-dumping legislation. 
</P>
<P>
If steel makers had their way, every American commodity would be erecting new 
managed trade arrangements to guard its own narrow interests. The result would 
be distorted markets, erosion of free trade, the risk of reduced competition 
and price inflation. These negative factors are behind the campaign against the 
import restrictions being mounted by 189 U.S. manufacturers and exporters who 
use steel in their products. 
</P>
<P>
The politics of the situation are complicated by a promise made by George Bush 
in the last days of his successful campaign for President. He said he would 
extend the voluntary restraints. Fortunately, he did not say how many or how 
long. He can now demonstrate his own commitment to freer trade by allowing only 
the most limited and most narrowly defined extension.

POLAND: STEADY ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lech Walesa, crusading leader of Poland's Solidarity union, who has turned 
moderate politician and sage in his middle years, said the other day: "In 
politics there is no regret. There is only calculation." It may be that it is 
only calculation that prevents Solidarity from gloating in public over its 
humiliating defeat of Poland's Communist Party in the recent election. The 
Communists, in turn, may be humble only in the most calculated way. In either 
case, the calculations have been correct. Only with the sort of shotgun wedding 
into which Poland's economy has forced the two parties is there any hope that 
Polish workers will make the kinds of deliberate, as opposed to enforced, 
sacrifices that it will take to pull the nation out of its depression. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders on both sides have understood since last August that they had no choice 
but to lean on each other for the strength to move Poland into the black 
financially. They also must know that working together is their only hope of 
moving Poland unscathed through the unchartable days of change in the political 
and power relationships at the Central European border between East and West. 
Since then, the question has always been whether impatient hard-liners in 
Solidarity and the still-dominant Communist Party would let them do what had to 
be done. So far so good. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's overwhelming victory over the Communists a week ago Sunday is now 
official and acknowledged. Solidarity holds 92 of 100 seats in the Senate, 
which has veto power over the lower house, the Sejm, and thus over the party at 
the legislative level. In a chivalrous gesture, Solidarity will ignore a rule 
to the contrary and allow Communists who lost in their bid for seats in the 
Sejm to try again in elections scheduled for two weeks from now. Without such a 
second chance, too many Communists with administrative posts, including the 
prime minister and the minister of defense, would have had no legitimate claim 
to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The final point of the joint effort is that with Solidarity running 
interference at top levels for Polish citizens, workers will join with fewer 
reservations the effort to turn the economy around. Neither side can predict 
the result. That will be determined by hope -- and calculation.

COLONIALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having exhausted his list of cliches and recycled a stack of banalities, Walter 
Russell Mead ("Bashing the Japan Bashers," Opinion, June 4) attacks the British 
with an outburst of scandalous revisionism. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he refers to British colonialism as one of "unparalleled 
cruelty," and in the next sentence dismisses Japanese colonial atrocities as 
being "on a smaller scale." Now I hate trouble his thesis with historical 
facts, but in one summer in Nanking, Japanese troops slaughtered more than 
300,000 unarmed people. That is more civilian casualties than the British 
incurred in two centuries of ruling two-fifths of our planet! And has Mead even 
passing acquaintance with the history of Europe's other colonial powers? Not to 
mention the United States, which came into existence through raping and 
exterminating one Indian nation after another. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, democracy is Britain's most successful export, and in this league it is 
unchallenged. Currently, 2 billion people live in freedom in countries that 
were formerly colonies of Great Britain -- hardly a legacy of "unparalleled 
cruelty."

HIGH-SCHOOL DROPOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery of Audie Chatman ("Why Do Students Quit? Unlocking the Riddle of 
Dropouts," by Ron Harris, Part I, May 28)? 
</P>
<P>
What is so mysterious? Here's a 17-year-old kid who is failing miserably at 
school, because he doesn't study, stays out at night, wakes up late, and 
doesn't go to class. So why are government officials, corporate executives and 
misguided sociologists so baffled? 
</P>
<P>
This kid, like so many others, is lazy. 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't all that surprising since his mother has candidly admitted, "I've 
got this lazy thing. I got frustrated and started doing what I wanted to do -- 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of looking for fundamental breakdowns in our educational system to 
explain mass student lethargy, I suggest the well-intentioned guardians of our 
country's future read the ironical profile of Dr. Serena Young, "A Surgeon 
Against All Odds" (View, May 28.) 
</P>
<P>
A young woman, of minority descent, is struck down with polio at the age of 2, 
and yet through hard work and sheer determination is able to earn a medical 
degree. I doubt Dr. Young spent many of her idle hours hanging out at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
There will be those who claim that individual circumstances make any type of 
comparison unfair. But the obvious similarities cannot be ignored. Here are two 
young people pitted against adversity. Both placed in unfortunate situations 
through no fault of their own. One chooses to wage a courageous battle and defy 
her disability. The other decides to waste away the hours and sleep until the 
afternoon sun.

DARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my opinion DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) is an absolute must in 
today's society! ("DARE Survives Early Doubts: L.A. Drug Effort Takes On 
International Dimensions," Part I, May 30). I do not understand how there could 
be any objections to such a program. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not there is actual conclusive proof of a reduction in drug use is 
not so much the issue. The fact is that through DARE we provide the "helping 
hand" our children need to guide them in making the right choices about drugs. 
It's very easy to tell a child what not to do, but what is needed is a lesson 
in how to deal with certain situations involving any kind of drug, before they 
arise. This is the responsibility that DARE has taken upon itself, and 
recognition for a job well done is long overdue.

CONRAD ON ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years many have thought that Conrad had a particular blind spot when it 
came to Israel and events in the Middle East. Invariably, his cartoons would 
lambaste Israel, demean her leaders, and insensitively exploit the symbol of 
the Jewish people, the Jewish star. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, however, it was hard to point with specificity to the 
inaccuracy and shortsightedness of Conrad's imagery. With all of the 
hyper-attention focused on Israel, his added fillips often just blended in. 
</P>
<P>
But the June 5 Conrad cartoon was, literally, the proof positive of Conrad's 
blind spot. While thousands of unarmed, peaceful protesters were murdered in 
Beijing, while mayhem and carnage continued unabated in Beirut, while the 
Ayatollah died and the, as yet, unratified peace treaty between Iraq and Iran 
threatened to unravel, and while ethnic riots peppered with killings took place 
in Uzbekistan, Conrad chose, once again, to focus on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in one week, Conrad's invective and bitter pen misrepresented, 
exaggerated, and maligned the Jewish state (May 28 and June 5). 
</P>
<P>
The challenges that a Democratic state faces in grappling with the insurrection 
of a hostile and violent element is a formidable one. Israel's record in 
dealing with the intifada is neither beyond criticism nor improvement. 
</P>
<P>
It does not, however, merit the pictorial invective that Conrad has dished out 
over the past 18 months and, most especially, during the past week. His moral 
outrage ought to be directed at those who merit his acerbic pen.

AID TO EL SALVADOR IS AID TO MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
SAME OLD GANG, NEW FRONT MAN, FOR AMERICA'S POINTLESS WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD N. GOODWIN, Richard N. Goodwin, who was an assistant special counsel 
to President Kennedy and a special assistant to President Johnson, is now a 
writer and commentator in Concord, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting with friends, watching pictures of ponderous, metal-sheathed vehicles 
crush life from the young Chinese, I joined the general expressions of horror 
and shock. But not surprise. For if there is one unforgettable lesson of our 
blood-stained century, it is that the savagery of mankind has not been tamed -- 
as some once hoped -- by the advance of science and reason. That monster, which 
has no home, which lives everywhere within the entire race, is continually 
ready to strike wherever the bonds of social order are loosened. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even as we recoil at the slaughter in Beijing, the U.S. Congress is 
preparing to help finance a similar assault on the innocents in a tiny fragment 
of Central America known as El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is no longer a country, it is a battlefield. It has been engaged in 
civil war for the entire decade. In that time more than 70,000 Salvadorans have 
been killed; at least one out of every 10 people has been forced from home and 
village; an even larger number have sought sanctuary outside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonists in this conflict have been a loose band of guerrillas who 
claim allegiance to some vaguely defined form of Marxism, opposed by the 
authoritarian Salvadoran military allied with some wealthy businessmen and 
landowners. Yet the war is basically an American war. We send more than $1 
million a day to support the power of the army and the rich. These resources 
alone sustain this long and bloody conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Although successful in keeping the war going, we have failed to halt the worst 
abuses of power or to construct a government willing to bring some measure of 
freedom and social justice to that ravaged land. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, right-wing forces, led by Roberto D'Aubuisson, organized a 
number of "death squads" to murder suspected guerrilla sympathizers and 
innocent peasants alike. Individuals, even entire families, were slaughtered in 
their homes or simply disappeared. When the courageous archbishop of El 
Salvador dared to protest these outrages, D'Aubuisson had him shot at the altar 
of his church. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Americans are barely aware of El Salvador's existence, and almost 
none could locate it on a map, these outrages were so blatant that an 
ordinarily indifferent public was stirred. An annoyed but compliant State 
Department felt compelled to assist a "moderate" Christian Democrat, Jose 
Napoleon Duarte, into the presidency; our chosen leader of a client state. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately Duarte proved to be ineffectual. Necessary reforms were not made 
and the Salvadoran military simply ignored his wishes and commands. In 
deference to American sensibilities -- and at the command of American 
authorities -- death squads were abandoned and the notorious D'Aubuisson 
disappeared, temporarily, into the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
To replace him, the extreme right, organized as the Arena Party, selected a 
nominal leader more congenial to American sensibilities -- Alfredo Cristiani, a 
millionaire businessman, educated at Georgetown and well-versed in the phrases 
that would please the continuing stream of American visitors to his country. 
</P>
<P>
I met with Cristiani little over a year ago while he pleasantly discoursed of 
the need for human rights, democracy, improved education and health care for 
the masses. Following this conversation, I talked with the American ambassador. 
There was no doubt that the United States had decided that the Arena Party, 
under the freshly polished leadership of Cristiani, would take over the country 
at the close of Duarte's term. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was. About a week ago, Cristiani was sworn into office in what our 
government termed El Salvador's "first peaceful transition of power from one 
elected civilian to another." But the crowd attending the ceremony more 
realistically reserved its loudest cheers for the entrance of Roberto 
D'Aubuisson who, lacking any official position, is clearly the leader -- the 
don -- of El Salvador. His henchmen occupy key security positions and the 
leaders of the military are his loyal subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that "democracy" in El Salvador is a charade; the new 
government is simply the old gang with a new front man. The vice president, 
hand-picked by D'Aubuisson, has already indicated his intention to reconstitute 
the death squads. The country will be run by the radical right, its use of 
brutality unrestrained by law; the wealth of the nation -- including the 
immense flow of U.S. aid -- will be allocated to the military and the wealthy 
few. Meanwhile, massacres of the past, and the murder of the archbishop, will 
go unpunished; after all, the perpetrators now control the instruments of legal 
power. 
</P>
<P>
All this is happening with the full approval of the United States, which is 
pledged to pour millions of dollars into continuing the interminable conflict. 
</P>
<P>
For the people of El Salvador, it is the continuation of tragedy. The majority 
of peasants and urban workers care little for either the guerrillas or the 
government. They want only peace -- the chance to live and work free from the 
omnipresent shadow of terror, to reap the rewards of their own labor, to avoid 
the confiscations of the wealthy and the guns of the soldiers. So little to 
ask. But they are unlikely to get it; not as long as the war and the horrors of 
an unrestrained soldiery are sustained by the wealth of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
We should know by now that we can supply guns and money to Central America, but 
we cannot control their use. We can call for democracy and human rights, but we 
cannot make them happen. In Nicaragua we supported Anastasio Somoza and got the 
Sandinistas. In Panama, we supported Manuel A. Noriega, and we got . . . 
Noriega. Now we are about to support the criminal D'Aubuisson and his gang. The 
consequence will probably be the eventual rule of an anti-American Marxist 
government. But a lot of people will be slaughtered along the way, and a lot of 
our money will be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
To vote for continued aid to El Salvador is to vote for murder and torture, to 
vote for increasing the possessions of the wealthy at the expense of the 
impoverished peasants. And it is, in all probability, to vote for the 
installation of still another hostile government in a part of the continent 
where America, if not loved, was respected, its leadership acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
But that seems exactly what the President and Congress are about to do. From 
the peaceful sterility of Washington chambers, we will send forth the means to 
unleash the most savage impulses of men. There will be no blood on the Capitol 
steps. But the blood of thousands will stain the soil of El Salvador. No U.S. 
interest will have been served. But the innocence that protects our freedom, 
the principles that restrain our own buried lawlessness -- will be further 
eroded.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS HAVE GOOD REASON FOR CELEBRATING TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers, who won their seventh indoor soccer championship Saturday night in 
Baltimore, will be treated to a celebration tonight at 6:30 at the San Diego 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The players will be brought in by limousine, introduced and presented with 
championship medallions. Speeches will be given by players and Socker Coach Ron 
Newman. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers defeated the Baltimore Blast, 6-5, in Game 7 to win the Major 
Indoor Soccer League championship. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Nomads set a Western Soccer League record by winning their 
seventh consecutive game in a 2-1 victory over the California Kickers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Paterson, a graduate of Mira Mesa High, scored both goals for the Nomads 
in the second half. It was the second consecutive game in which Coach Derek 
Armstrong switched Paterson from midfield to a forward position after halftime 
and received a two-goal dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Nguyen assisted on one of Paterson's goals and has now contributed an 
assist in six consecutive games, another league record. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Boardman got the other assist.

FORMAL, SENSUAL MOODS PERVADE IN MALE NUDE PHOTOS

Ah, the male nude. 
</P>
<P>
From the classic proportions of Greek sculpture, to the gathering power of 
Michelangelo's "David," to the amputees and dwarfs by contemporary photographer 
George Dureau, the male figure has been portrayed variously by artists 
throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
At the Photowest Gallery downtown, the more decorative aspects of form prevail 
in an exhibit of 42 images by San Diego photographers David Eliot and Jeff 
Palmer. Called "Interpretations of the Male Nude," the exhibit of black and 
white photographs might also be titled "Formal and Sensuous" or "Warm and 
Cool." 
</P>
<P>
Eliot takes a cooler, more formal, tack, while Palmer approaches his subject as 
an object of sensuousness. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer applies light and shadow to draw attention to well-muscled physiques or 
to portray a mood. Torsos ripple with sharply defined muscles. Tousled heads 
abound. Most of the moods are reflective. 
</P>
<P>
In one print, a row of thin, vertical shadows stripe the chest and face of a 
model, lending a feminine quality and a pensive mood. Soft lighting bathes 
another reclining model, his back arched before a black background, with the 
head thrown back perhaps in ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Palmer's work is attractive without being compelling. In one case an 
image works better upside down. 
</P>
<P>
A supine model lies in darkness with his head nearest the lens and feet 
farthest away. The arms are outstretched. Oddly enough, the picture, which had 
been hung upside down, has more power when inverted. When viewed upside down, 
it calls to mind Icarus flying through the dark. 
</P>
<P>
The least interesting pieces by Palmer, such as one in which hazy daylight from 
a window washes a man deep in thought, resemble saccharine gift cards. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's strongest image is of a man standing by a French door. The unforgiving 
rectangular patterns of windows and the hard glass make a sharp contrast with 
the vulnerable, naked body. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Eliot takes a more formal approach in his nude studies. He 
positions his camera and crops his photographs primarily to focus on the body's 
various lines and shapes. 
</P>
<P>
A portrait taken from a low angle suggests a Greek statue. His close-up of a 
torso is an intimate study of the curving lines of chest, biceps and haunch. 
</P>
<P>
One full-frontal image of a black man is at odds with most of Eliot' work. The 
model radiates power and tension from the crossed arms to his flexed shoulder 
muscles and broad thighs. 
</P>
<P>
Positioning the camera slightly above another model's hips, Eliot's portrait is 
a study in the symmetry of a sturdy back, the hips and upper thighs. 
</P>
<P>
"Interpretations of the Male Nude" continues at the Photowest Gallery, 744G 
Street, Suite 205, through June 30.

SYSTEM OF FAIR PLAY UPSETS SOME SPECIAL INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The process by which radio stations are chosen to promote individual grandstand 
shows during the Del Mar Fair is only a little less complicated than 
Pythagorean geometry. 
</P>
<P>
Called a "weighted preference" system, each station lists, in order, the acts 
it wants to promote during the two-week run of the fair, which starts Friday. 
For its first choice, the station gets to put five slips of paper in a bowl, 
from which the host station's name for that particular act will be chosen. Four 
slips of paper representing the station go into the bin for its second choice; 
three for its third choice. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in what one radio promotions director described as "an antiseptic little 
ceremony," the station names are drawn from the drums for each act. 
</P>
<P>
The sole intent of this very serious-sounding procedure is to be as fair as 
possible to all the radio stations. The system was implemented last year, after 
years of complaints about certain stations always getting to promote the best 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this massive attempt at fairness is remarkably similar to the 
result of the old system -- a group of upset promotions directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's about as fair as it possibly can be, but it's certainly not 
working," KSON Promotions Director Steve Sapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond simply not getting the acts they wanted to promote, some promotions 
directors are irritated that stations were given acts that are in no way 
related to their on-air formats. 
</P>
<P>
The news-talk format of XTRA-AM (690) will be promoting the "Dukes of 
Dixieland" show. KSDO, which also features a news-talk format, is the proud 
sponsor of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and the "30th Anniversary of Rock 
'n' Roll" shows. 
</P>
<P>
None of this pleased the folks at KCBQ (Eagle 105), which plays oldies rock 'n' 
roll. Through the luck of the draw, the only show Eagle 105 will be able to 
promote is a 2 p.m. staging of the "30th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll." 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Berkman &amp; Daniels (the Fair's public relations agency) 
is going to extraordinary lengths to be fair," Eagle 105 Promotions Director 
Leslie O'Neal said. "But I think they should take into account that an act 
shouldn't be promoted by a station that doesn't have the act in its rotation." 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials say their only goal was to come up with a system that is 
equitable to all the stations. 
</P>
<P>
"To take the pressure off, we've developed what is actually a very simple 
system," said Berkman &amp; Daniel's Shawn Riley, broadcast media coordinator 
for the fair. "We feel like we've always had it under control. We feel we've 
dealt with everybody as fairly as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Although no one doubts the intent to be fair, some wonder what purpose it 
serves to have KSDO sponsor oldies rock acts. Or to have lowly-rated KOW 
promote Waylon Jennings instead of KSON. 
</P>
<P>
"They're being very equitable, and I know they're really trying to be fair," 
KFMB Promotions Director Joan Hiser said. "But, by being so fair, I think 
they're doing themselves an injustice as well as the radio stations." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the frustration of some promotions directors, some stations 
arranged to promote acts by simply contacting the group's management directly. 
KGB-FM (101.5), for example, bypassed the whole lottery affair and arranged to 
promote the "Guitar Legends" shows. KKLQ (Q106) did the same with Milli 
Vanilli, although XHRM also arranged to participate in the show. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-evolving System may be changed next year to disallow stations to 
contact acts directly, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to refine the process a little further," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There's irony here, in that this long and complicated process is designed for a 
relatively minor promotion, something the promotions directors don't really 
care that much about. They don't get anything out of it, beyond 40 fair tickets 
to give away on the air and a chance to have one of their announcers introduce 
the act. They can't even put up a banner on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be that big a deal," O'Neal said. "But each year we go through a 
process that causes stations to get up in arms." 
</P>
<P>
The Arbitron ratings advances released last week show KFMB-TV (Channel 8) and 
KGTV (Channel 10) virtually neck and neck in the 5 p.m. news sweepstakes. 
Channel 8 had a 12 rating and 28 share, followed by Channel 10 with an 11 
rating and 27 share. (A rating is the percentage of households tuned to the 
show; a share represents the percentage of households with the television 
actually on during the time period.) KNSD-TV (Channel 39), which tried 
desperately to make a ratings splash in the last sweeps period with a 
long-running news series on seniors, posted a weak 4 rating and 10 share. At 11 
p.m., where Channel 39 is usually competitive, the NBC affiliate posted a 
surprisingly low 4 rating and 15 share. Channel 10 led at 11 p.m. with an 8 
rating and 29 share, followed by Channel 8 with a 7 and 24. The Nielsen book, 
which often tells a slightly different story, is due out next week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Despite the debacle of the Tyson-Spinks fight, for which people paid as much as 
$50 for 90 seconds of Tyson pounding Spinks into a mound of very well-paid 
Jell-O, Cox Cable spokesman Marty Youngman reports pay-per-view orders for 
tonight's Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight are on pace with past big 
fights. Late last week, there had been about 9,000 orders countywide for the 
well-hyped "War," Youngman said. Since most orders are placed at the last 
minute, Youngman still expects about 20,000-25,000 orders before fight time. Of 
course, last minute callers pay the price. The fee for day-of-the-fight orders 
jumps from $34.95 to $39.95. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8's commercials attempting to build a persona for anchor Stan Miller 
are hilarious. In one shot he is sitting next to a fireplace, earnestly reading 
a book. They apparently resisted the urge to dress him in a smoking jacket, 
with a pipe in his mouth. . . . XTRA-AM (690) waited until after the San Diego 
Padres' announcement that they would keep their radio contract with KFMB-AM 
(760) before XTRA announced its decision to give ex-Padre Steve Garvey a 
morning talk show. Perhaps XTRA wasn't sure Garvey's name would be helpful with 
the Padres, since Garvey's announced plans to try to buy the club a few years 
ago may have strained his relationship with the club. XTRA chief John Lynch 
said the announcement of Garvey's hiring was based strictly on the timing of 
Garvey signing a contract, although Lynch alluded to Garvey's hiring the day of 
the Padres' announcement. XTRA discussed a "Bob Costas-type morning show" with 
the Padres, Lynch said, but didn't bring up Garvey because he hadn't signed a 
contract. "From a baseball standpoint, a more sports-oriented show could have 
been a positive," Lynch said. "The fact that Mrs. Kroc may have a nose-bleed 
over Garvey because of the attempt to purchase the club, may have been a 
negative, I don't know." Garvey's 5:30 to 9:00 a.m. show begins June 26. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido-based daily Times-Advocate is dropping its long-running Thursday 
tabloid section, North County Magazine, in favor of a new standard-size weekly 
entitled "Go." The section, which premiers Thursday, will be event- and 
calendar-oriented. The name, the result of an in-house contest, is an 
abbreviation of "going out.". . . 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's "Written by Raymond Chandler" series 
continues at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday with "The Blue Dahlia," for which Chandler 
received an Oscar nomination. Beyond his classic style, Chandler is a perfect 
choice for a La Jolla series -- he lived there in the 1940s and 50s.

NEW JOHN WAYNE AIR TERMINAL COST IN MID-RANGE, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite months of controversy about cost overruns and design changes, John 
Wayne Airport's new $50-million passenger terminal is neither cheap nor 
expensive when compared to similar projects nationally, according to an 
informal Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
A Times survey of 21 projects throughout the United States showed a wide price 
range, from $59 per square foot of new terminal space in Fargo, N.D., to $357 
per square foot at Chicago's splashy new United Airlines complex. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne's new terminal is running about $148 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by controversy from the start, the terminal is part of a $310-million 
expansion program that also includes new garages, roads, bridges and airfield 
improvements -- Orange County's biggest public works project ever. The project 
has been beset by design errors, cost overruns, and mistakes in price 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But with the topping off of the ironwork last month, the new terminal appears 
to be progressing more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14 Weeks Behind Schedule 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury, in one of its periodic progress reports, last 
week warned that the project is 14 weeks behind schedule. But officials still 
predict that the new structure will be occupied by April 1, although some 
interior walls may not be painted by then and some gates may not be open to 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, issues remain, such as the siting for a million-gallon, 
above-ground fuel storage facility, business disputes between prime contractor 
Taylor Woodrow California Construction Ltd. and subcontractors, and difficulty 
in reaching the goal of 10% participation by firms owned by women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Project Manager Richard Begley: "The worst is behind us. You 
will see enormous progress from this point forward." 
</P>
<P>
Begley has contended that the problems at John Wayne hardly stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples found in The Times survey: 
</P>
<P>
* In San Jose, a soils engineering firm failed to discover an underground 
stream at the site of the city's new passenger terminal, causing delays for 
pumping. Delivery of tons of granite from Italy fell behind schedule. And an 
airport spokesman said the city is probably going to seek reimbursement from 
the architect for some errors and omissions discovered in blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
* In Nashville, Tenn., where a new $105-million facility nearly twice the size 
of the new John Wayne terminal was completed in only 21 months, two 
subcontractors went broke in mid-project. The head of the agency in charge of 
Nashville's airport expansion was embroiled in a controversy over his ownership 
of land near the airport. A fish on the endangered species list was found in a 
stream near the new terminal site, and airport neighbors have sued to block 
construction of a new runway that environmental impact documents previously 
failed to mention. 
</P>
<P>
* In Albuquerque, N.M., where a project doubling the size of the airport's 
existing terminal will be completed later this month, the sandy soil beneath 
the building shifted. The roof leaked on airline employees. The heating and 
cooling systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
* In Chicago, work began on some sections of the $500-million United Airlines 
terminal before others had been designed. The new terrazzo floor cracked. 
Construction workers went on strike. And the multimillion-dollar glass roof, 
which was reflecting blinding streams of light into the eyes of air traffic 
controllers, had to be etched with acid after it was already in place. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such problems, officials at each of these airports used phrases like 
"running smoothly" to describe their terminal-construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Up Time 
</P>
<P>
Problems occur, airport and airline industry officials say, because airport 
projects are large, complex, and rely on armies of workers who have trouble 
communicating. Some officials, such San Jose airport spokesman Steve Grossman, 
are fatalistic. "I believe that on almost any project you're going to find some 
of these things," he said. "But the bottom line is that, here at least, they 
have not delayed the expected completion date because you make up time as you 
go along." 
</P>
<P>
The frenzied pace of airport building is part of a national boom in terminal 
construction and remodeling caused by intense competition among airlines for 
market share and a need to replace inadequate, worn-out facilities that were 
built to accommodate first-generation jetliners 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, for example, plans to build a new airport at a cost of more than $2 
billion. Chicago is going through a $2-billion airport-improvement program that 
includes the recently opened, $500-million United Airlines terminal. National 
Airport in Washington and its sister airfield, Dulles International Airport, 
are jointly planning $1.2 billion in improvements. Dallas-Ft. Worth and JFK in 
New York are each planning improvements totaling more than $1 billion. Orlando, 
Fla., is in the midst of a $430-million expansion program, and San Francisco 
anticipates spending at least $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
And at Los Angeles International Airport, which was remodeled for the 1984 
Summer Olympics, Delta Airlines last year spent more than $85 million 
reconstructing its terminal, and several airlines are spending an additional 
$200 million combined on other terminal remodeling projects. The Federal 
Aviation Administration reports that annual requests for airport development 
grants have jumped from $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion just in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Boom Needed 
</P>
<P>
"We need this construction boom," says Tom Browne, manager for airport policy 
and administration at the Air Transport Assn., the industry group that 
represents air carriers. "Most everything (new) that's going in is capacity 
related. . . . There are more passengers and more planes. And some of the 
capacity gains involve replacing the old with the new." 
</P>
<P>
Air travel demand is expected to reach 750 million passenger boardings per year 
by 2001, compared to 450 million projected for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Most airport terminal construction or remodeling is financed with revenue 
bonds, which are repaid with airline landing fees and rents collected from food 
vendors and car-rental agencies. When leased airport space goes up in price 
because of remodeling or new construction, concessionaires charge the public 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
A Continental Airlines official, for example, recently stated that if Denver 
builds a new, $2.3-billion airport, it could add $36 to ticket prices for 
passengers going to or from that facility. 
</P>
<P>
One industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new 
passenger terminal at John Wayne Airport could add $5 to $7 to the airlines' 
cost for each boarding passenger.

L.A. COUNTY BACKS TOUGHER LAW ON SCHOOL HEALTH EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen years ago, the Legislature decreed that first-graders receive physical 
examinations intended to detect child abuse, vision and hearing deficiencies, 
anemia, heart murmurs and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
But within the Los Angeles Unified School District, 14,938 first-graders, or 
28%, had not received their health screening by December's deadline. And within 
the district's San Fernando Valley schools, the percentage was higher -- 4,044 
children, representing 30% of the first-graders in the area, had not been 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts with a significant number of unchecked children this school 
year include: Newhall (46%), Palmdale (39%), Sulphur Springs (37%), Burbank 
(29%), Glendale (29%) and Las Virgenes (19%), Los Angeles County records show. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, 30,030 children, or 22% of first-graders in public schools, did not 
receive physicals by the 1988 deadline. Statewide, 24% of first-graders 
attending public schools did not receive them in 1987, the last year for which 
complete figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, within the Los Angeles Archdiocese, only 8% of the first-graders 
did not visit a doctor. Most private schools throughout the state posted 
similar numbers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Pushed 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the large numbers of public schoolchildren who are not seeing a 
doctor, Los Angeles County health officials have asked for legislation to 
pressure school districts to improve their figures. 
</P>
<P>
The county is vigorously supporting a bill that would financially penalize 
school districts for every child who does not receive a physical or whose 
parents do not sign a waiver foregoing an exam. The measure would require the 
state to withhold average daily attendence money, called ADA, for each of these 
children. This could mean a loss of thousands or millions of dollars, depending 
on the size of the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Based on its ADA allotment, the Los Angeles district could have lost $36.8 
million this year if the bill had been law. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no penalty, what is the urgency of the schools to do it?" asked 
Dr. Sydney Smith, the county's director of child health and disability 
prevention, a vocal advocate of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of local school officials has ranged from ambivalence to outright 
hostility over the bill, which is being sponsored by Assemblywoman Teresa P. 
Hughes (D-Los Angeles). The legislation, which sailed through the Assembly 
Education Committee earlier this month on a 14-0 vote, is before the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Another Intrusion' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be frank. It's another health department intrusion into the 
operation of school districts," J. Michael McGrath, superintendent of the 
Newhall School District, said of the bill. "Whether it's good or bad is beside 
the point." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Hayes, director of Los Angeles district's nursing services, said she 
supports the goal of the bill but worries about its effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed per se to the concept, but withholding ADA will make it very 
difficult not only for us but for smaller districts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stiff monetary sanctions would serve to jolt some district administrators who 
do not make the screening a high priority because there are no teeth in the 
present law, Smith contended. While health screenings are required if a parent 
does not obtain a waiver, children are not prevented from attending school if a 
waiver is not granted, as is the case in many cities on the East Coast and in 
the Midwest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a child who is entering school for the first time in California is 
barred if he or she has not obtained all necessary state-mandated immunizations 
for such diseases as polio, diphtheria, measles and whooping cough. 
</P>
<P>
In talks with school officials, Smith said he has detected a blase attitude 
about the screenings. "Some say nobody is going to bother us. What are you 
going to do about it? We're not going to lose anything if we don't comply." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the need for physicals, Smith said the exams conducted by private 
doctors detect health problems in 40% of the first-graders examined. While some 
of the problems are minor, it is still a staggering number, he said. Less 
intensive health screenings at schools, often conducted by nurse practitioners, 
detect trouble in 10% to 15% of the children examined, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Less than one-third of the school districts in Los Angeles County, which 
maintain an affiliation with a consulting physician, do their own screenings. 
</P>
<P>
School officials interviewed agreed that the exams are crucial because they 
detect problems that could hamper a child's education if left unnoticed. They 
noted that the checkups are the first for some poor children, who are examined 
for free if their families meet poverty guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"A kid can be very bright, but if he is sick or he has a physical disability, 
he can't use what God gave him," said Dr. Helen Hale, Los Angeles Unified's 
medical director of student medical services. 
</P>
<P>
But school health coordinators say getting parents to agree is a paper-work 
nightmare. Many districts begin notifying parents at the beginning of 
kindergarten that their child must be examined by the time he or she reaches 
first grade. 
</P>
<P>
But some parents are apathetic and never bother to take their children for a 
physical, health authorities said. Others, classified as the working poor, fall 
through the cracks -- they do not qualify for free exams, but they cannot pay 
for a doctor's visit. And there are parents who have complied with the 
requirement, but who never bothered to get their physician to fill out the form 
that the school district needs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"My frustration really is with parents complying," said Frida Martinez, 
Glendale Unified School District's health coordinator. "There is no excuse for 
kids not to get care in this country." 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services has not announced its position on the 
bill. But department officials are concerned that the districts might use a 
loophole in the legislation to circumvent its intent. The bill would continue 
the practice of allowing parents to sign waivers exempting their children from 
exams. Now, parents may object to the exams primarily on religious or 
philosophical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
School districts, however, could have parents who fail to comply sign waivers 
so that ADA money will not be withheld, said Gordon Cumming, chief of the 
state's child health and disability prevention branch. He and other health 
officials suspect that some districts are already routinely using the waiver 
when parents will not cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the dilemmas," Cumming said. "What's hoped is that if you push 
people into it, more will get the exam, but the alternative is they may all 
sign waivers."

ULTRAFAST TRAIN LIKELY TO STOP WHERE RIDERS WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If enthusiasm were the determining factor, Anaheim would have no rival in 
becoming the Southern California terminus of a proposed high-speed Las Vegas 
train -- and the north San Fernando Valley wouldn't even be under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
But if the futuristic train is ever built, ridership projections, not local 
fervor, are likely to dictate where it will go. 
</P>
<P>
And no one seems ready to assay whether Mission Hills or the Magic Kingdom is 
the better bet for the $4-billion railroad to shuttle Southland gamblers to Las 
Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a 16-member bistate commission will take the first step toward 
determining which Southern California terminus is more likely to attract the 
private investment needed for the 200 m.p.h. train to become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Nevada Super-Speed Ground Transportation Commission was created 
in 1988 by the two states' legislatures to see if the train proposal is 
feasible and, if so, to determine where in California it should begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ontario Airport 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas gambling casino operators, who first suggested the high-speed 
railroad several years ago, initially focused on Ontario Airport as the western 
terminus for the train. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Bernardino County city gave the proposal a chilly response, saying 
it would worsen congestion on local streets and freeways and would encourage 
local dollars to leave their community for Las Vegas while giving little or 
nothing to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
And San Bernardino County officials also made it clear that they viewed a 
railroad built solely to lure gamblers as carrying a stigma. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario's rebuff left the north Valley and Anaheim as the only contestants. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's proposal is vigorously backed by most local officials, who view it as 
a golden opportunity to link the Southwest's two prime tourist destinations -- 
Las Vegas and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The north Valley proposal, on the other hand, was the brainchild of Los Angeles 
Department of Airports officials, who say the fast train might be the 
long-sought key to opening city-owned Palmdale Airport to passenger traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the Valley and Palmdale, the train would carry both Las Vegas-bound 
passengers and those heading for our airport," said Dennis Green, 
administrative assistant to Clifton A. Moore, department general manager. 
</P>
<P>
With a high-speed train, the Palmdale Airport, which now has no major scheduled 
passenger flights, could lure some Valley residents away from Los Angeles 
International Airport, which is increasingly congested, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The north Valley terminus recently was endorsed 10 to 0 by the Los Angeles City 
Council, although several members indicated they had strong misgivings about 
the plan and were only voting to keep it under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the north Valley proposal faces severe hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
For one, the airport department's plans for Palmdale Airport have been scaled 
down dramatically in recent years, suggesting that airport-bound traffic might 
not be significant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airport Plans 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, the department had planned a super-airport for the 
site. That airport would have handled huge volumes of cargo and passenger 
flights bound for overseas as well as cities all over the United States. A 
high-speed rail link with Los Angeles was part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But recent projections indicate that even with Southern California's population 
boom, the demand needed to justify such an airport will not be there for 
decades to come, if ever, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the department wants to open the facility "as a regional 
airport much like Burbank Airport," with most flights destined for California 
and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The airport department's proposed terminus is in Mission Hills or possibly 
Sylmar near the confluence of the Golden State, Antelope Valley, San Diego and 
Foothill freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The hope would be to siphon off passengers generated by the Santa Clarita 
Valley and the north Valley who otherwise would go to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Figures 
</P>
<P>
Green said he had no figures on how many such passengers there are. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential roadblock is Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of 
the Assembly Transportation Committee and chairman of the bistate commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I would support such a train," Katz said, "it would have to offer 
Southern California commuters some relief. In fact, I believe that without such 
relief, no plan could be sold to the California public. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport proposal is totally an airport concept," he said. "It does nothing 
for commuters." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said he could suggest no way the airport department plan could be altered 
to provide commuter relief and said he was unfamiliar with how the Anaheim 
proposal might affect rush-hour traffic in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth, a member of the 
bistate commission and a former mayor of Anaheim, envisions an Anaheim-to-Las 
Vegas train patronized chiefly by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chief Booster 
</P>
<P>
Roth, chief booster of the Orange County proposal, said the high-speed train 
would encourage tourists to combine visits to Orange County, which has 34 
million tourists annually, with a trip to Las Vegas, which has 17 million 
visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the small army of workers who daily commute to Orange County jobs from 
their lower-priced San Bernardino County homes might find the train convenient 
to use, he said, "but I feel the basic economic underpinning would have to be 
tourist business." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Roth said, he has begun studying the possibility of getting 
"still more use out of an Anaheim-Las Vegas" rail line by converting George Air 
Force Base in Victorville, slated to be closed within three years, to civilian 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility is that we might simultaneously be able to relieve John Wayne 
Airport and increase patronage on the train," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The base is a few miles west of Interstate 15, which planners assume the 
high-speed train would follow for at least half the 230-mile distance between 
Southern California and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selecting Technology 
</P>
<P>
In addition to determining the proposed train's feasibility and selecting a 
Southern California terminus, the bistate commission is charged with selecting 
a technology. 
</P>
<P>
Under consideration are Japanese bullet-train, the French TGV high-speed train 
and the German experimental magnetic levitation technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said that if a route can be selected, the choice of technology might turn 
on which manufacturer is willing to invest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
He envisions as much as $3.8-billion in private investment in the $4-billion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which meets Saturday in Anaheim, will first commission a series 
of ridership and cost studies, Katz said, adding that he couldn't predict what 
plan, if any, the commission ultimately will take back to the two legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
Said the airport department's Green: "At this point, Anaheim seems to be ahead. 
But we feel the studies will tell us where we stand."

PLINKING GIVES WAY TO PREHISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
PROTECTED STATUS SOUGHT FOR INDIAN SITES IN ANGELES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Canyon is an unlikely place to discover something worthy of inclusion in 
the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon, tucked deep in the heart of Angeles National Forest about 11 miles 
northeast of Saugus, for years resembled a war zone. Thousands of gun 
enthusiasts had sprayed the hillsides, cottonwoods and desert plants with 
bullets and had illegally hauled in rusting cars, refrigerators and buckets of 
paint to use as better targets. 
</P>
<P>
Only when forest rangers closed the area to shooters last year did the forest's 
two archeologists feel safe enough to approach the canyon, which was littered 
with a carpet of spent shells and shotgun casings. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a payoff when they finally got a good look at the area -- they 
discovered ancient rock art painted by Indians about 1,000 BC. 
</P>
<P>
"How this managed to be saved is a wonder among wonders," said Rick Wessel, the 
forest's assistant archeologist, standing under a canopy of 20-million-year-old 
boulders where the faded red drawings were found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artifacts Found 
</P>
<P>
This is one of 22 sites the forest's antiquity detectives have uncovered in the 
past four years that the state deemed eligible for acceptance into the National 
Register of Historic Places -- the first and most critical step in the process. 
Decorated rocks used for Indian rites and the remnants of Indian mortuaries, 
earth ovens, sweat lodges (where men retreated for saunas) and tribal 
ceremonies also have been exhaustively documented. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the archeologists have opened a window on what life was like in 
the parched mountains in the early 20th Century by documenting Depression 
mining activities and the feuding between forest rangers and those who had gold 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
The money for all the work has come from an unlikely source. State off-highway 
vehicle fees have paid for the survey of 2,000 acres. The project, which could 
cost up to $100,000 by the time it is completed, has kept the two archeologists 
and many summer interns busy for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual alliance has not been totally smooth. The archeology work caused a 
two-year delay in the creation of formal off-road vehicle paths in the Rowher 
Flats portion of the forest's Saugus district. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have attempted to ensure that none of the proposed trails in 
Rowher Flats will destroy prehistoric or historic sites. Some routes have been 
redrawn after the archeological team determined that land was historically 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't move archeological sites; you can close . . . OHV sites," said Mike 
McIntyre, the forest's archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
Cam Lockwood, the forest's off-highway vehicle program coordinator, said he can 
understand the frustrations of off-road vehicle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
"The archeologists are constantly finding more and more; every time they go to 
a new site they find something new," Lockwood said. The off-road enthusiasts 
"are concerned that eventually the whole area will be blocked or closed except 
for a very, very narrow band." 
</P>
<P>
What the archeologists are doing could be compared to police lifting 
fingerprints from a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
There are no prehistoric structures standing in the forest, nor any foundations 
remaining. Many of the artifacts, now stored at UCLA, are rocks shaped into 
hammer stones or grinding tools. They also have collected beads and arrowheads, 
some dating back 3,000 years. And they have squirreled away for future analysis 
hundreds of small bags of dirt that contains tiny particles of food waste and 
plant materials. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at these sites, it doesn't look like much is out there," 
McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studying Life Style 
</P>
<P>
It is not the archeologists' intent, however, to collect a museum full of 
impressive relics. They typically only excavate tiny sections of a site to get 
a sampling of what might be hiding below. What they hope to take away is a 
better understanding of what life was like for the Indians who lived in these 
rugged hills and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
They discovered that the prehistoric inhabitants, classified as hunters and 
gatherers, were much more sophisticated than anyone had thought, Wessel said. 
The archeologists concluded that the Indians were less concerned about living 
near food and water. Rather, they seemed to locate their campgrounds on what 
they considered sacred ground. 
</P>
<P>
The discoveries could have ramifications in other national forests. For 
instance, when federal archeologists survey timberland before the chain saws 
are allowed in, they may now consider exploring the hilliest, most remote areas 
instead of presuming Indians didn't live there. 
</P>
<P>
"We treat prehistoric cultures . . . very simplistically," Wessel said. "We 
treat them as foragers of food in California. There is a lot more to 
prehistoric culture than just caching food." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tataviam Indians 
</P>
<P>
Many of the prehistoric artifacts belonged to the Tataviam Indians, who 
maintained an economy based on shells and beads, practiced astronomy and 
observed a complex social system headed by religious leaders, McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
The most unusual possessions the Indians left behind, the experts said, are 
hundreds of pitted rocks, called "cupules," found scattered across the 
mountains. Women who wanted to bear children would tap out shallow holes in the 
large rocks and pray, the archeologists said. The Indians also would fill the 
holes in ceremonies meant to bring rain. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cupules are just a stone's throw from a modern snippet of history 
in the oldest national forest in California. Hoping to make the semiarid 
Angeles productive like the cool green forests of the Northwest, forestry 
employees sprayed a section of the forest with defoliants in the 1960s, Wessel 
said. The intent was to clear out the brambles of desert foliage and plant 
trees that could one day be chopped down for timber. 
</P>
<P>
The tree plantation was a failure. Today, little grows there and the 
experimental trees remain miniatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diet of Yucca 
</P>
<P>
The Indians also left behind clues to their diet. For them, the heart of the 
yucca plant was as popular as today's hamburger, the archeologists said. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians would wait patiently for seven years to harvest the mature Yucca 
plant until it was just about to flower. They'd cook the heart, which tastes 
like soap when improperly prepared, until it carmelized and tasted like yams. 
It could be diced and stored for a year. 
</P>
<P>
The archeologists haven't been able to save all the artifacts ravaged by man 
and nature. Last summer, for instance, an excavation team descended upon a 
large rock shelter that they suspected contained the hidden remains of a 
prehistoric oven. But carbon testing of the earth showed that the site had been 
"turned topsy-turvy" by motor bikes, Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt bikers and gun lovers are not the only natural predators of archeological 
artifacts. Scavengers have disturbed grave sites looking for spear points, 
pottery, abalone pendants, beads and effigies. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals have almost obliterated a second example of rock art discovered in 
Texas Canyon. The archeologists suspect New Agers, who believe in the curative 
power of crystals, might have crudely drawn some Indian symbols over the real 
thing, the archeologists said. Soot from campfires has further damaged some 
pale zigzag drawings. 
</P>
<P>
As a defense against vandals, the archeologists have borrowed hidden motion 
detectors once used by rangers in national forests in northern California to 
spot marijuana growers. Placed at two prehistoric mortuaries, all they have 
spotted so far are animals.

SPRING GROWING CHILLY FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember those charmed days of April and May when every Angel ground ball 
seemed to find a hole, when the Angels won games they had no business winning, 
when the sun shone brightly and the wind was always at the Angels' backs? 
</P>
<P>
Well, things are starting to even up. 
</P>
<P>
The rain that fell on the Angels Sunday afternoon at Royals Stadium provided a 
fitting backdrop for what was happening to them on the field. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the 5-3 loss to the Kansas City Royals was complete, former Angel 
catcher Bob Boone would unload a three-run home run, Devon White would fail to 
catch a playable fly, pitchers named Terry Leach and Jeff Montgomery would shut 
out the Angels for five innings and the Royals would sweep the Angels in Kansas 
City for the first time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need a weatherman to tell know which way the Angels are going. 
Sunday's defeat was the Angels' fourth consecutive loss, their longest losing 
streak of the season, and left them 3-6 in June. 
</P>
<P>
The first Angel slump of 1989 is upon them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people have been looking at us closely," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said, "and one of the tests that needs to be passed is what we're going 
through now. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things can be learned by this. How much resiliency we have. How much 
patience I have as a manager. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's vitally important for us to remember we're a very good 
ballclub, that we can right the ship." 
</P>
<P>
Boone, who used to captain that ship, helped sabotage it Sunday. His home run 
against relief pitcher Rich Monteleone capped a sixth inning of 
self-destruction for the Angels, turning a 3-2 Royal deficit into a 5-3 Royal 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The inning began with Jim Abbott (5-4) pitching to Bo Jackson. Jackson drove 
the ball to deep center field, where the Gold-Gloved White hangs out, and 
watched the ball sail over White's head. The ball bounced off the base of the 
fence -- White often pulls down balls over the fence -- and by the time White 
could regain his bearings, Jackson was sprinting into third. 
</P>
<P>
A ground out by Pat Tabler scored Jackson and the Angels' lead was cut to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Then Danny Tartabull and Jim Eisenreich singled to knock Abbott out of the game 
and bring on the Monteleone-Boone encounter. Monteleone, recalled five days 
earlier from triple-A Edmonton, worked the count to 3-1, shook off catcher 
Lance Parrish's request for a slider and tried to sneak an inside fastball past 
Boone. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels should have gone with Parrish's first thought. Inside fastballs can 
be sneaked by Boone -- he hadn't hit a home run since last Aug. 28 -- but this 
one was so fat, Boone looked more like Bo when he turned on it. 
</P>
<P>
Deadpan, Kansas City Manager John Wathan said he saw it coming all along. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you bet," he said. "He gets one every year, doesn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
Boone turned to Wathan when he returned to the bench and told him, "Good. I got 
that out of the way for this year. Now I can relax." 
</P>
<P>
Boone's home run was his seventh hit in 18 at-bats against his former 
teammates. A point is being made here, in case the Angels didn't understand the 
message Boone sent them last winter when he jumped to the Royals for an 
$883,001 contract -- one dollar more than what the Angels paid him in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fun to play against your old team," Boone said. "For that 
individual, I think it's like a playoff atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Boone is batting .284, contrasting with the .246 mark owned by his successor, 
Parrish. Boone also has 16 RBIs, seven doubles, a .350 on-base percentage, even 
a stand-up triple. 
</P>
<P>
And now, he has his home run. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this one, coming against the team he felt no longer wanted him, was 
special, Boone smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, any time I hit a home run is kind of special," he said. "When I hit a 
home run, it's just an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Accidents are breaking out all over around the Angels these days. Kirk 
McCaskill suffers a rare early inning blowup on Friday. Greg Minton serves up 
his first home run in 364 days on Saturday. Boone clears the fence on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go through one of these things," Rader said, "these are the sort of 
things that happen to you. Our bullpen has given up home runs the last two 
(games), which is uncharacteristic. The vast majority of our lineup is not 
producing well, which is also part of the equation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why you go bad. It's no big mystery. Every club goes through it and 
it's our time to go through it now." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Wally Joyner, who had his first four-hit game since 1987, 
and Claudell Washington, who had two singles and two runs, the Angel lineup 
produced little. After scoring three runs in three innings against Kansas City 
starter Floyd Bannister, the Angels managed only three hits in five innings 
against Leach and Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to position Steve Farr for his second save in as many days. 
Farr pitched the ninth inning for the Royals, yielding a leadoff double to Jack 
Howell but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Farr struck out Washington and Johnny Ray to end the game, the 
Angels found themselves staring at an 0-3 start to this trip -- and dim 
prospects for the immediate future. Tonight, struggling Mike Witt opens a 
three-game series in Texas. Then, on Tuesday, the struggling Angel offense will 
face Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody ever said it was going to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
While Jim Abbott was working on a 3-1 lead in the fourth inning, reserve 
catcher Bill Schroeder was flat on his stomach, crawling under the Angel bench 
to surprise Angel physical therapist Roger Williams with a hot foot. Television 
viewers were able to catch Schroeder in the act. When Chili Davis crashed into 
the left-field fence to take an extra-base hit away from Danny Tartabull, the 
cameras panned the Angel dugout for Manager Doug Rader's reaction. There, right 
under Rader's seat on the bench, was Schroeder. "I think he might've lost a 
contact lens," Rader quipped. Schroeder was asked if he had considered lighting 
Rader's laces while he was down there. "Oh, no," Schroeder said. "You never 
light up people in the game. And that includes the manager." 
</P>
<P>
Rader tried to downplay Devon White's miss of the Bo Jackson fly that triggered 
Kansas City's four-run sixth inning. "The way the ball was carrying in the 
rain, it was hard to tell," Rader said. "The ball Jack (Howell) hit (for a 
ninth-inning double), you could've asked the same question: Should (Jim) 
Eisenreich have caught it? I don't think it's fair to comment when you're 400 
feet away." . . . Shoulder tendinitis forced Abbott to miss one start, making 
this his first appearance in 12 days. Abbott pitched 5 1/3 innings, giving up 
six hits and three walks. Abbott said the shoulder felt fine, but that the 
layoff affected the sharpness of his pitches. "That wasn't one of my better 
starts, obviously," he said. "I didn't make good pitches and was putting 
runners on base every inning. That's going to catch up with you and in the 
sixth inning, and it did."

SCOTT OSTLER: KAREEM PLAYS ONE FROM THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Kareem-o-Meter, which measures the effectiveness of Mr. Abdul-Jabbar as 
a Laker center from game to game, the readings range from "In Your Face, 
Young-'Un" down to "I Shoulda Stood in Bed." 
</P>
<P>
Most games this year, including playoff games, neither the needle on the meter 
nor Kareem himself has done much jumping. 
</P>
<P>
You know how that gadfly Wilt Chamberlain is fond of saying "I could 
out-rebound Kareem in my sleep"? 
</P>
<P>
That's an exaggeration, of course, but there have been games when a sleeping 
Wilt could have tied Kareem on the rebound chart. Like the game in the Western 
Conference semifinals against the Seattle SuperSonics, when Kareem played 28 
minutes and found no rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Kareem was so much older then, he's younger than that now. Sunday he put 
the bad times behind him, played easily his best game of the season, 
statistically and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of his teammates, especially injured guards Magic Johnson and Byron 
Scott, Kareem scored 24 points and actually leaped for and grabbed 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough, as you probably already know. The Pistons won, 114-110, to 
take a 3-0 series lead. But if Kareem has another game or two like this one in 
him, there is life yet in the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"He went back in a time machine and grabbed something out of 1970," said Piston 
forward Rick Mahorn. 
</P>
<P>
What Abdul-Jabbar grabbed was his heart and his legs. Big Fella was chasing 
rebounds Sunday, rather than vice versa. Games like this used to be routine for 
Kareem, but that was back when Hoover was president and gasoline was a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing players still respect the Laker captain, but more from a historical 
perspective. There's not much raw fear mixed in with their reverence. 
</P>
<P>
"We still worry about Cap," Piston forward John Salley said earlier in the 
series. Salley, like many players, looks upon Kareem as a kind of big brother, 
a friend. If Kareem has been aloof at times with the public and press, he has 
reached out to many NBA opponents, including Salley. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never count him out," Salley said, "no, Lord, and if I did, you 
wouldn't never ever hear me say it." 
</P>
<P>
No, Lord, you do not want to rile the Big Fella. 
</P>
<P>
Going into Sunday's game, his playoff averages were below average -- 10.5 
points and 3.3 rebounds in 22 minutes. He was the Lakers' seventh-leading 
rebounder, barely ahead of Michael Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Piston guard Isiah Thomas, 6 feet 1, was a more effective rebounder than 
Kareem. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, the game's oldest player played 33 young minutes. His two free 
throws with 1:48 left brought the Lakers to within three points of the Pistons, 
and his scrambling defensive rebound a half minute later, snatched away from 
the swarming Piston board-crashers, led eventually to a James Worthy hoop, 
cutting the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem worked hard. On offense, to be effective, Abdul-Jabbar must establish 
base camp on the low post. He must fight for position, in order to set up a 
launching pad for the sky hook. The Piston defenders try to either beat Kareem 
to this spot, or to beat Kareem after he gets there, and the officials are 
almost always busy somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
At times Sunday it looked like the Captain was being guarded by an octopus, 
pinning down Kareem's arms so it appeared he might have to take the feed-in 
passes in his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
But Kareem battled for that low-post spot as if it was a claim in the heart of 
the Mother Lode. 
</P>
<P>
"Kareem made the decision on his own that he wanted the ball today," said Mitch 
Kupchak, Laker assistant general manager. "When he posted up, you could look in 
his eyes and see he wanted it. Everyone was depending on him and he came 
through." 
</P>
<P>
He tossed up sky hooks, spun into the lane for layups, even went up for a 
couple of awkward jump shots. Not Michael Jordan stuff, but Kareem was what the 
Lakers needed desperately in this situation -- an experienced hand who was not 
afraid to ram the ball at the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
That's one thing Kareem, at his best, can still give the Lakers. As even 
Chamberlain grudgingly admits, "I'll say this about Kareem: He's never been 
afraid to take the shot. When the game's on the line, he wants the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday he wanted it, got it, used it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a liability, he was a beacon. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether Kareem can do it again. 
</P>
<P>
To be honest, I didn't think he had even one of this kind of game in him. What 
he was until Sunday was a former great, great player demonstrating why 
40-year-old (and up) men do not play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday he was a freak of nature. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have 82 of those games in him," Kupchak said. "He couldn't have 
done this all year, but today somebody had to step forward." 
</P>
<P>
If Kareem can do it at least one more time, he might not go out a winner, but 
he will go out Kareem.

FISTFUL OF CHANG;

<P>
17-YEAR-OLD STOPS EDBERG IN 5 SETS FOR FRENCH MEN'S TITLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time seemingly since Mona Lisa was a baby, an American has won 
the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Frame this one and hang it in the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
It took 3 hours 41 minutes for a 17-year-old kid from Southern California to 
end a 34-year-old winless streak at Roland Garros, where the hopes of every 
U.S. male player since 1955 lay buried beneath its red clay. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Michael Chang became the youngest to win a Grand 
Slam men's singles title when he captured the French Open championship with a 
6-1, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 decision over Stefan Edberg of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, from Placentia, weathered a blizzard of break points in the fourth set 
when Edberg, the latest in a long line of Swedes in the final here, seemed only 
a volley away from victory. 
</P>
<P>
But Edberg found himself playing an iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
And it started to wear on him in the fourth set, beginning in third game. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, 10 times Edberg was a point away from breaking Chang's serve and 
10 times Chang turned him away when even he felt he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought that the match was gone," Chang said. "But a chance went 
through my head. I thought, 'Hey, maybe I can do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Edberg, it was a demoralizing defeat. Ahead a set and a break, he was 
cruising along like one of those party barges on the Seine. The break points 
piled up, but one by one they disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg had four break points that would have put him up 2-1. He had five more 
that would have made it 4-3 and another for 5-4. However, Chang saved them all, 
snatching the last one away from Edberg in what became typical fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Chang sent a backhand pass at Edberg like a heat-seeking missile and the Swede 
volleyed the ball into the net. 
</P>
<P>
So it was Edberg, not Chang, who was serving to stay in the set at 4-5 in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Fatigued from trying to punch a volley past someone who patrolled the baseline 
as if he were on roller skates, Edberg double-faulted twice and put two volleys 
in the net to give the fourth set to Chang, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg was the 11th Swede in the past 12 years to play in the final here, but 
at this point he began to wonder why he ever crossed rackets with Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"He played a lot of tough matches the whole tournament and he kept coming back 
all the time," Edberg said. "You have to admire him for that." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe someone older wouldn't have, Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's young and he doesn't think that much." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, a two-time winner of the Australian Open and the reigning Wimbledon 
champion, had the look of a champion again. He began the fifth set by breaking 
Chang's serve. 
</P>
<P>
But at 15-40, Chang broke back. On the first break point, he produced a Grand 
Slam quality drop shot, which he feathered over the net by just slightly 
touching the ball with his racket. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the end for Edberg and the beginning for Chang arrived in the 
next game. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, Edberg fell behind 0-40. He saved two break points, but then Chang 
came up with a Grand Slam quality lob to get the break he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg forced Chang to retreat to the baseline with a powerful approach shot, 
but Chang put up a artful lob that flew over Edberg's head, bounced once and 
skipped away as if it were being pulled by a string. 
</P>
<P>
The next game was longer than the French Revolution, but when it was over, 
Chang put the match in his bag. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, he did it the hard way. Down two break points, Chang saw Edberg 
force the game to deuce four times, but pulled it out after the final one when 
two consecutive Edberg backhands sailed wide. 
</P>
<P>
Chang won his service game at 15 to lead, 5-2. Edberg covered his head with a 
towel at the changeover. It was the last one. 
</P>
<P>
Another lob winner by Chang and Edberg could only wave at it with his racket. 
At 15-30, Edberg sent a forehand into the net. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 16,500 filled the stadium court from the bottom row to the top and 
cheered in anticipation of what was soon to come. On match point, Edberg put 
one last forehand into the net and put Chang in the record books. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, however, has to be content with being the youngest known male winner. In 
1905, 17-year-old Rodney Heath of Australia won the first Australian 
championship, but his exact birth date is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who is 17 years 3 1/2 months old, struggled with his new found place in 
tennis history, although he definitely seemed to like it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to really think about it," he said. "It just doesn't click in my 
head. It's definitely a great honor. It's definitely an achievement that will 
be with me no matter how I do the rest of my career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely probably the highest achievement that I could ever have." 
</P>
<P>
But not definitely. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope maybe one day I'll be able to achieve something greater than this." 
</P>
<P>
His work began with unexpected ease. Chang closed out the first set in just 32 
minutes with a forehand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
"He started playing unbelievable," Edberg said. "I don't think he made many 
mistakes the first hour." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the tournament, Edberg stuck to his serve-and-volley style, which 
although it presented a target for Chang's passing shots, often worked for him, 
just as it did when Yannick Noah won the 1983 final. 
</P>
<P>
Chang had a tactic of his own. Edberg's serve is particularly devastating on 
clay because it bounces so high that returns are difficult. But Chang moved 
inside the baseline to take the ball quickly. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Edberg's serve, which had dismantled Alberto Mancini and Boris 
Becker, did not blow over Chang, who also made another change in his tactics by 
attacking Edberg's ground strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's frustration grew. 
</P>
<P>
On Chang's speed: "He's so quick, he gets a lot of time to hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
On Chang's accuracy: "He very seldom misses a passing shot." 
</P>
<P>
But as well as Chang began, the middle of the match belonged to Edberg. Chang 
lost seven consecutive games at the end of the second set and the start of the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
He was reeling. Then came the third set. He thought it was over. 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know," Chang said. "The fourth set was just a couple of points 
here and there. Stefan gave me an opening, I guess, but I finally believed 
there was a chance I could come back." 
</P>
<P>
The winner's share of the French Open is $291,752, which not only more than 
doubles his career earnings, but also goes along nicely with the distinction of 
winning one of his sport's biggest honors. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week, Chang beat the No. 1 player in the world, Ivan Lendl, and the 
No. 3, Edberg. His No. 19 ranking is expected to improve to the top 10 when the 
new rankings come out today. 
</P>
<P>
He becomes the sixth U.S. player to win the French Open, joining such players 
as Don Budge (1938), Don McNeill (1939), Frank Parker (1948-49), Budge Patty 
(1950) and Trabert (1954-55). 
</P>
<P>
Chang's title is also the first Grand Slam singles title for a U.S. man since 
John McEnroe won the U.S. Open in 1984. The other Grand Slam events are 
Wimbledon and the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has one, Chang said there could be more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to limit myself," he said. "I don't want to say, 'OK, Michael, 
you've won Roland Garros and that's it.' I want to keep on going and do 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
What is the secret of Michael Chang? "Head, mind, strategy," said Joe Chang, 
Michael's father. "He's the kind of guy that when you look at him one game, one 
match, you can't be impressed. But you watch him from match to match and he 
looks better and better. 
</P>
<P>
Chang Gang: All of Chang's family watched him win from the stands of Roland 
Garros: Joe and Betty Chang cheered their youngest son while older brother Carl 
sat on the front row. Joe Chang had to return because he left before Michael's 
match with Ivan Lendl. "In my head, I didn't think he could beat Lendl. Not on 
clay, in three of five sets. It's almost impossible." The elder Chang said 
Michael's victory in the finals over Stefan Edberg was hard to believe. "That's 
not real. I think it is just a dream." Joe Chang said he watched videotapes of 
Edberg's matches and gave Michael a scouting report. His plan was to play a 
hardcourt strategy on clay. "We noticed when (Alberto) Mancini was playing 
Stefan, he was not able to return serve. So we had Michael attack the ball on 
the service return and play more aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
To get ready for Wimbledon, Chang will play in an eight-man grass-court 
exhibition in Amsterdam this week and another exhibition the week before 
Wimbledon in London. Also playing in the London exhibition? Edberg. . . . Chang 
is scheduled to play in the Volvo tournament at the Los Angeles Tennis Center, 
beginning Sept. 18 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEVEN IS HIS LUCKY NUMBER 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang's French Open final victory over Stefan Edberg was his seventh in 
the tournament. Chang spent a total of 20 hours and 38 minutes on the court and 
played 28 sets. Here is the path Chang followed to win his first Grand Slam 
tournament:

GIBSON LEADS OFF 3-1 DODGER WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' quest for a center fielder who can bat leadoff didn't produce a 
trade Sunday but it did produce a new leadoff hitter who played center field. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of what he said was a sleepless night, frustrated by the Dodgers' 
ongoing offensive struggle, Manager Tom Lasorda moved Kirk Gibson from third to 
first in the batting order, elevated Eddie Murray from fourth to third and 
employed Mike Davis as the cleanup hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The result? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it can't exactly be said that the Dodgers ended the slump. 
</P>
<P>
They collected only four singles as their team average dropped from .227 to 
.226, but parlayed the wildness of Cincinnati Reds' rookie Scott Scudder, some 
creative strategy by Lasorda and a six-hitter by Tim Leary and Jay Howell to 
defeat the Reds, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"All I see is the 'W' and that's what's sweet," second baseman Willie Randolph 
said of a win that was only the Dodgers' fourth in their last 11 games and 
enabled them to stay within seven of the Houston Astros, who lead the Reds and 
San Francisco Giants by one game in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson went hitless in three at-bats, but he walked and scored in the third, 
when the Dodgers ended a string of 23 scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 1 for 31 at the time, flared a two-run, bases-loaded single in that 
inning after Randolph sent Gibson to third on a hit-and-run single to 
left-center, Randolph taking second when Eric Davis threw to the plate. Murray 
was walked intentionally, and Davis looped his single over shortstop Barry 
Larkin for a rare lead. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, whose bat control seems better suited to the No. 2 position in the 
batting order than the leadoff spot he has been asked to fill on occasion, 
singled in the Dodgers' third run in the fourth after Alfredo Griffin walked 
and was sacrificed to second by Leary. 
</P>
<P>
"Randolph is an exceptional No. 2 hitter if we can get someone on who can run 
and steal," Lasorda said. "With Kirk up there, we can manufacture runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a catalyst, we had to do something. We'll keep him up there and see 
what happens, see if he can turn the offense on." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, the Michigan native, slipped into a T-shirt bearing a Detroit Pistons' 
logo and said the victories by the Dodgers and Pistons were comparable to a 
doubleheader sweep. 
</P>
<P>
He said he couldn't remember the last time he batted leadoff, but would give it 
his customary aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be more cohesive," Gibson said. "We need to work together as a 
lineup and that hasn't been the case. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to bat leadoff, I'll do my part to try and create easy runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be aggressive and let them (the opposition) know I'm going to be 
aggressive. I mean, if they want to throw Willie junk, I'm going to be on 
second, no doubt about it. I'm going to be running. 
</P>
<P>
"If we start manufacturing runs, the guys will relax at the plate and swing 
like they're capable. We need to have more diversity." 
</P>
<P>
More hit-and-runs, perhaps. More double steals. Lasorda, operating from the 
third base coaches box Sunday, successfully called for both in the two-run 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to hook up with Willie like we did today," Gibson said of the 
hit-and-run. "If I'm on third with one out, that's an easy way to score runs. 
I'll show you how to score because I'm going to be running (on anything hit to 
the infield)." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, who has raised his average to .288 by batting .343 over his last 35 
games, disputed the contention that he is more effective or prefers the No. 2 
spot in the batting order over leadoff, saying his approach doesn't change. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd prefer to see Gibson in more of a power situation but Tommy wanted to 
shake things up and it worked," Randolph said. "Right now, we've got to create 
some offense. Right now, winning is the only thing that matters." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers stole four bases as four Cincinnati pitchers issued eight walks, 
including six in four innings by Scudder, making his second major league start. 
</P>
<P>
Leary improved his record to 5-4 and lowered his earned-run average to 2.97 by 
giving up five hits in eight innings before Howell registered his 12th save in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Benzinger homered in the first for the Reds. Leary walked only two, which 
disturbed Red Manager Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked them, but we wouldn't take walks," he said. "Leary was wild, but it 
won't show in the box score. He could have walked 10, but we have a lot of guys 
who won't take walks. If a pitcher is going to be wild, let him be wild." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda conducted a pre-game meeting with all of his pitchers, telling them not 
to press, to put the offensive struggle out of their minds, to caution them, 
perhaps, against public crticism of the offense and to offer his 
congratulations on their good work. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time like this," he said later, "with everyone talking offense, offense, 
offense, the pitching has gone unnoticed and I wanted them to know they have 
done a hell of a job. They've kept us in the game and I wanted them to know I 
appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers lead the major leagues with a team ERA of 2.74. Leary and Howell 
showed why Sunday, and the new leadoff hitter scored the first of the only 
three runs they needed. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda said he will remain in the third base coaching box for as 
long as the Dodgers are winning. The Dodgers won three in a row with Lasorda 
there earlier this season. . . . On asking Kirk Gibson to bat leadoff, Lasorda 
said, "He's a great competitor. He'll do anything I ask." . . . The Dodgers 
have 14 hits for the first three games of the series, all singles. . . . The 
Reds had won four straight and nine of 11. . . . Mariano Duncan, who went on 
the 15-day disabled list with a cut on his right hand May 28, is expected to 
come off today, necessitating a roster move. . . . The Dodgers announced the 
signing of their No. 1 selection in last Monday's summer draft, pitcher Kiki 
Jones of Hillsborough High in Tampa, Fla. Jones received a bonus estimated at 
$170,000.

EASY GOER MIGHT MAKE HAY WHILE SUN SHINES; 
</P>
<P>
IF SUNDAY SILENCE TAKES SUMMER OFF, BELMONT CHAMPION COULD WIN DIVISION 
</P>

<P>
Thanks to that $1-million bonus he clinched by running second in Saturday's 
Belmont Stakes, Sunday Silence has earned about $700,000 more than Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
But Easy Goer, the toast of New York after he atoned for his Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness sins with a smashing victory in the Belmont, could catch up quickly 
if he doesn't have to hook up with Sunday Silence soon. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer will continue to run in the East while Sunday Silence returns to 
trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn at Hollywood Park for a rest. With Easy Goer 
and Sunday Silence dominating the 3-year-old division, both will be heavy 
favorites wherever they run, as long as they're not in the same race. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the Big Two, only Hawkster ran in all of the Triple Crown races, and 
his handlers should be considering other options after what is believed to be 
an unprecedented three consecutive fifth-place finishes. Hawkster was beaten by 
a total of 35 1/2 lengths in the Derby, Preakness and Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
The only fresh horse to run against Easy Goer and Sunday Silence in the Belmont 
was Le Voyageur, a French-raced son of Seattle Slew who ran one of the fastest 
opening miles in stakes history, then hung on to finish third, a length behind 
Sunday Silence. Le Voyageur is headed back to France and probably won't race in 
the United States until the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park in November. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, whose colt beat Easy Goer by 2 1/2 lengths in the Derby and by a 
nose in the Preakness before losing the $5-million Triple Crown by eight 
lengths in the Belmont, plans to give his colt the equivalent of a month off 
before regrouping for the rest of the 1989 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer is headed for the $1-million Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 19, with the 
$500,000 Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on July 29 to serve as a prep. 
</P>
<P>
The Travers is 1 1/4 miles, the same distance as the Derby, but Whittingham 
isn't saying whether the Travers will be considered. After the Belmont, Arthur 
Hancock III, Sunday Silence's principal owner, was talking more about the 
$3-million Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 than he was the Travers. If Sunday 
Silence skips the Travers, he probably would prep for the Breeders' Cup with a 
race during Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting in October. 
</P>
<P>
There are no major races on dirt for 3-year-olds in California during the 
summer. A race that might tempt Whittingham is the $1-million Super Derby at 
Louisiana Downs on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Whittingham finished third in the Belmont with Ferdinand after the 
colt won the Derby and ran second in the Preakness. Ferdinand, who had minor 
physical problems, was given the rest of the year off. The next year, as a 
4-year-old, Ferdinand was raced extensively early in the year and got a 
two-month breather before he won a stake at Santa Anita in November, won the 
Breeders' Cup Classic two weeks later and then was voted horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Observers foresee the 76-year-old trainer doing the same thing this year with 
Sunday Silence -- giving him time off until the fall and then running him in 
the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Horses who win the first two legs of the Triple Crown but lose the Belmont 
still usually win the 3-year-old championship. Of the 11 horses who lost the 
Belmont after winning the first two races, seven were voted the title. Two of 
the Triple Crown spoilers, Stage Door Johnny in 1968 and Arts and Letters in 
1969, were voted top 3-year-old colt, and Arts and Letters also won horse of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
After Kauai King won the Derby and Preakness in 1966 and then ran fourth as 
Amberoid won the Belmont, Buckpasser won the division title and was also voted 
horse of the year. Buckpasser didn't run in the Triple Crown, but won the 
Travers and also beat older horses in the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Buckpasser was raced by Ogden Phipps, the owner of Easy Goer, and the 
80-year-old investment banker says that Easy Goer could be even better. Some 
horsemen say that he already is, having recovered from the disappointments in 
the Derby and Preakness to run one of the strongest Belmonts. 
</P>
<P>
Nine horses won the Belmont by larger margins, but Easy Goer's time of 2:26 
ranks behind only Secretariat's 2:24 when he won the Triple Crown in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his tour de force Saturday, Easy Goer may be considered the nominal 
leader of the division until he and Sunday Silence meet again. If the rematch 
is in the Breeders' Cup, the distance will be 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get back to 1 1/8 and 1 1/4 miles, the result might be the same as the 
Derby and the Preakness," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Here's the breakdown on how the $1-million bonus was divided among Sunday 
Silence's camp: Principal owner Arthur Hanock III received $385,000; partner 
Ernest Gaillard, $192,500; Charlie Whittingham, as minority owner and trainer, 
$292,500; jockey Pat Valenzuela, $100,000; and the barn help -- exercise rider, 
groom, et al -- $30,000 each. Imaginative minds painted the scenario that 
Calumet Farm, which owns Le Voyageur, brought the colt from France to run in 
the Belmont so he could burn out Sunday Silence with his speed and enable Easy 
Goer to win. Easy Goer is a son of Alydar, who stands at stud at Calumet in 
Lexington, Ky. But Patrick Biancone, Le Voyageur's trainer, said that he had 
been planning to run in the Belmont since March. . . . The Valenzuela riding 
family has now failed to win the Triple Crown with three horses that failed in 
the Belmont. Milo Valenzuela couldn't win the Belmont after taking the Derby 
and Preakness with Tim Tam (1958) and Forward Pass (1968). Pat Valenzuela is 
Milo's nephew.

It hasn't taken Gene Klein any time at all to start improving the value of the 
horses he is going to offer in a dispersal sale in Kentucky in November. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, the most successful owner in racing since he started paying big prices 
for horses in 1982, announced on Friday that he will leave the game because of 
a desire to do some extensive traveling with his wife, Joyce, who introduced 
him to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Klein's Is It True won the $117,000 Riva Ridge Stakes at Belmont 
Park. Then, on Sunday at Belmont, Open Mind, Klein's superb 3-year-old filly, 
beat Gorgeous by a head in the $227,200 Mother Goose. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind has also won the Acorn here, and if she can win the Coaching Club 
American Oaks on July 3, she will become the seventh horse to sweep Belmont's 
three-race series for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Under Angel Cordero in the Mother Goose, Open Mind ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 2/5, 
setting a stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, winning her eighth straight stake, earned $136,000 and paid $2.60 to 
win. Gorgeous, a shipper from Hollywood Park, was ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye 
and they finished 18 lengths ahead of Mite of Fun.

LEARY TREATS FANS WITH SOME NIFTY TRICKS; 
</P>
<P>
HE KEEPS HEAVY-HITTING REDS OFF-BALANCE WHILE PITCHING DODGERS TO A 3-1 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Cincinnati outfielder Eric Davis toyed with the crowd before Sunday's 3-1 
Dodger victory over the Reds, staging an impromptu souvenir contest and 
offering baseballs to whichever section of fans cheered the loudest. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Dodger pitcher Tim Leary did a dandy imitation of Davis, with a few 
minor alterations: 
</P>
<P>
1) Using home plate as his target, Leary did his crowd-pleasing rendition 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
2) Like Davis, Leary also put the ball wherever he pleased, but he was toying 
with the Reds, not the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
3) Leary made no contest out of it, and, rather than noise, his reward was 
silence -- as in, very quiet Cincinnati bats. 
</P>
<P>
Using a dipping, dying split-fingered fastball, Leary (5-4, 2.97 earned-run 
average) baffled the Reds. He allowed one run in the first inning on a home run 
by Todd Benzinger, but sprinkled four harmless singles over the next seven 
innings. Jay Howell pitched the ninth for his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Leary's outing all the more impressive is that he did it against 
Cincinnati, which leads the National League in hitting (.256 team batting 
average) and was averaging more than 10 hits in its last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to make some adjustments after the first inning, so I threw a lot 
of split-fingered fastballs, probably more than I've ever thrown in one game," 
Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
Leary ran into his only trouble in the seventh, when with none out, he allowed 
back-to-back singles to Benzinger and Barry Larkin. Up stepped Davis with the 
hope of giving the fans behind the left-field fence yet another baseball. 
Instead, however, Leary smothered the rally by inducing Davis to bounce into a 
double play and getting Ken Griffey to fly out. 
</P>
<P>
"All forkballs," Davis said, shaking his head. "You could tell he didn't have 
his good fastball, so from the first inning on he became a pitcher. He stayed 
ahead of us and did a real good job of disguising his pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Leary has beaten the Reds twice this season, the other victory being a 
complete-game five-hitter on April 6. He is 5-2 lifetime against Cincinnati 
with a .300 career batting average (six for 20) to boot. 
</P>
<P>
But, having caught the illness that has been spreading throughout the Dodger 
dugout, Leary was hitless in two at-bats Sunday. After hitting .269 last year, 
he is hitless in 24 at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the coughing, wheezing Dodger offense did, however, muster four 
hits Sunday, providing Leary with three early runs -- exactly three more runs 
than it scored in the previous 23 innings combined. 
</P>
<P>
The offense has become such a concern that Tommy Lasorda had a closed-door 
meeting with his pitchers before Sunday's game, presumably to tell them how 
well they were doing and perhaps to also caution them against criticizing the 
offense publicly. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly did Lasorda say? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he just asked us how our families were," Fernando Valenzuela said, 
throwing a verbal curve. "I think he closed the door because it was personal."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
NEW MARINERS MAKE PITCH TO MAKE UP FOR LOSS OF LANGSTON, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
When the Seattle Mariners turned down some big names to get three young 
pitchers for Mark Langston last month, it raised plenty of eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners, it turns out, may have known exactly what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman earned his first American League victory and Gene Harris got his 
first major-league save Sunday at Cleveland as the Mariners beat the Indians, 
6-3. Holman and Harris both came in the trade with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Johnson, the third player obtained from the Expos, pitched three-hit ball 
for 7 2/3 innings in Saturday's 3-1 victory over the Indians, improving his 
record with Seattle to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I see a lot," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "That's three top quality 
arms and three competitors out there. I'm tickled to death for us." 
</P>
<P>
Holman (1-1) allowed seven hits, including a homer, double and single by Pete 
O'Brien, in Brian Holman 
</P>
<P>
5 2/3 innings. Harris worked the final 3 1/3 innings for the save. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not Mark Langston," Holman said. "We're Randy Johnson, Gene Harris and 
Brian Holman. People are never going to be satisfied if they're looking for us 
to be Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I was trying too hard to impress people (at first) because it 
was a big trade." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Bill McGuire hit his first major-league homer, a three-run shot off 
Bud Black, in a four-run sixth inning that made it 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Black (5-7) yielded five runs, two of them earned, on seven hits in 5 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Texas 1 -- Dave Parker and Mark McGwire hit back-to-back homers in 
the sixth inning as the A's increased their AL West lead to three games over 
the Angels by downing the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (8-4) allowed Texas three hits in 6 1/3 innings, lowering his 
earned-run average to 1.91. Greg Cadaret got one out and Gene Nelson retired 
all seven batters he faced for his first save and Oakland's 23rd, tops in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
The A's had a 2-1 lead when Parker led off the sixth with his ninth home run 
and McGwire followed with his 12th, both off Kevin Brown (5-3). McGwire also 
had a sacrifice fly in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Bush hit a two-run homer and Kirby Puckett 
added a two-run single, leading the Twins past the White Sox at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson (7-4) allowed eight hits in seven-plus innings and got solid 
relief from Juan Berenguer and Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
Berenguer entered with a 4-1 lead, the bases loaded and none out in the eighth. 
He retired Ivan Calderon on a foul pop and struck out Carlos Martinez before 
walking Dan Pasqua to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon came on to get the side out and pitched a scoreless ninth to register 
his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Melido Perez (3-8) lost for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Detroit 0 -- Mike Flanagan and Duane Ward combined on a four-hitter 
at Toronto and the Blue Jays handed the Tigers their fourth shutout of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan (4-5) allowed three hits in seven innings. It was his first outing 
since a sore left shoulder forced him to miss two starts. Ward finished for his 
fifth save, striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto rookie Junior Felix went four for five with a two-run homer. Rookie 
Mike Schwabe (1-1) shut out Toronto until the fifth, when Rance Mulliniks 
doubled and Felix hit an 0-and-2 pitch into the second deck for his fifth home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Baltimore 1 -- Rob Deer doubled home the go-ahead run in the ninth 
inning at Baltimore and the Brewers handed the Orioles their fourth loss in 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, leading the AL East, won eight straight before their recent slump. 
Milwaukee has won eight of 12. 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Surhoff got a bunt single with one out in the ninth against Kevin Hickey 
(1-1), who gave way to Gregg Olson. Surhoff stole second and third before 
coming home on Deer's double. Deer took third on Mike Felder's single and 
scored on Olson's wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Crim (5-3) pitched one inning to get the victory. Dan Plesac worked the 
ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4-8, Boston 2-7 -- Rickey Henderson snapped an eighth-inning tie with 
a run-scoring pinch single to win the nightcap and Don Mattingly drove in six 
runs as the Yankees swept the Red Sox at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly hit a pair of two-run homers in the second game and had a two-run 
double to back the pitching of Andy Hawkins (6-7) in the opener. Hawkins 
allowed four hits and two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly was five for eight for the day and has 40 runs batted in this season. 
His second home run gave New York a 7-2 lead in the seventh inning of the 
second game, but the Red Sox rallied for five runs off Lance McCullers to tie 
the score. Scott Nielsen (1-0) halted the Boston rally and got the win.

BACK FOR MORE: RODMAN BEATS PAIN

<P>
This series has been a boon for people who sell electrical impulse stimulators, 
the gizmos that are supposed to speed up the healing process by keeping the 
blood circulating in an injured area. 
</P>
<P>
Laker guard Byron Scott has practically been married to one since suffering a 
torn left hamstring while practicing the day before Game 1. Now, it's Piston 
forward Dennis Rodman who can't leave home without it, thanks to upper back 
spasms. 
</P>
<P>
Rodman took it a step further. After playing well again in Game 3 -- 19 
rebounds and 12 points in 28 minutes -- he spent the next 30 minutes or so on 
the trainer's table on his stomach. In addition to the electrical device, he 
also had an ice bag planted on his back. Most of the time he was out of the 
game was spent lying along the sideline in front of the Piston bench, a la Rick 
Mahorn with a similar injury in last season's finals, and receiving more ice 
treatments from trainer Mike Abdenour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting the double whammy," Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
But at least he was able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was killing me," Rodman said of his back. "It was hurting. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't have made a difference if I had stretched a lot. I knew I would 
get hit in the back. I knew I would get hit in the side. But, hey, these are 
the championships, so you've got to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
The day had its soothing moments, beyond another great rebounding effort. A 
notoriously bad free-throw shooter -- 62.6% in the regular season -- he made 
all six attempts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Piston guard Isiah Thomas looked in on injured Laker Magic Johnson Saturday 
night, staying only long enough to see how his close friend was doing and being 
careful not to hang around too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I went by his house last night," Thomas said. "I just went by to give him a 
kiss, to say I was here if he needed me and that I love him. That's it. I 
didn't ask him how he was doing. It's a fine line to walk. I didn't want to 
make it look like I was trying to decipher information from him or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the injuries, Laker Coach Pat Riley said no one should extend 
sympathy to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taught long ago by Adolph Rupp (at Kentucky) -- my greatest coach -- 
that courage and will and heart are fine, but the main thing is winning," Riley 
said. "Anyone you can describe as having great will and heart is a loser, 
because those are things you say about (losers)." 
</P>
<P>
The debate continues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Should Johnson risk long-term injury to play in Game 4 on Tuesday night, or 
should he call it a season? 
</P>
<P>
Mark Aguirre, the Piston forward and a close friend of Johnson, said Sunday: "I 
would think it would be risky for him and the Lakers' franchise. I would think 
that with this being the possibility of being the last game, he would not play. 
But knowing him the way I do, it's going to be hard to keep him off the court." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said pulling Johnson from Sunday's game after 4 
minutes 46 seconds was best. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect him to play (on Sunday)," Abdul-Jabbar said. "It would just be 
too risky to ask him to play with the injury." 
</P>
<P>
Add Abdul-Jabbar: When a reporter noted that his 13 rebounds were a 
season-high, the soon-to-retire center smirked and said: "Better late than 
never." 
</P>
<P>
There have been four four-game sweeps in NBA Finals history -- in 1959, Boston 
swept Minneapolis; in '71, Milwaukee swept Baltimore; in '75, Golden State 
swept Washington; and in '83, Philadelphia swept the Lakers.

Tony Trabert isn't sorry he is no longer the answer to a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who was the last American to win the French Open? 
</P>
<P>
A: Until Sunday, it was Trabert. 
</P>
<P>
Trabert, who won back-to-back in 1954 and 1955, watched from the television 
booth at Roland Garros as Chang became the new answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very happy for him," said Trabert, who broadcast the final for an 
Australian network. "I think he played exceptionally well. As a matter of fact, 
I said before we went on the air that I thought he'd win." 
</P>
<P>
As the failures of U.S. players in the French Open grew, Trabert achieved a 
sort of annual notoriety as the last American to win it. Trabert found that 
distinction amusing. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, I haven't had anything to do with the other Americans not winning," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, John McEnroe should have won it. That would have ended all this 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe lost the 1984 final to Ivan Lendl after winning the first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the tournament, Trabert had handicapped the U.S. hopefuls, but he 
didn't include Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly didn't think Michael would win," Trabert said. "In fact, I didn't 
think any American would do it this year. John pulled out, Andre Agassi wasn't 
in the best physical condition. I thought Michael didn't have all the guns to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Trabert said he considers the French Open the most demanding of the four Grand 
Slam events because each point on clay takes so much energy to play. 
</P>
<P>
"But Chang showed a lot of courage," Trabert said. "When things were going 
badly for him, it would have been very easy for him to slide into the twilight. 
</P>
<P>
"Both he and Stefan wanted to win. The question was who didn't want to lose the 
most." THOMAS BONK

RAVELING TELLS MARYLAND HE'S STAYING PUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC basketball Coach George Raveling announced that he has withdrawn from 
consideration for the vacant head coaching job at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
After being interviewed at Maryland on Thursday, Raveling met with two personal 
advisers Saturday night. After deciding to remain at USC, he informed Maryland 
Athletic Director Lew Perkins of his decision and issued a statement to the 
media on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration I have concluded that it's in my best interest to 
fulfill the remaining years of my contract at USC," Raveling's statement read. 
"The principal reason I have elected to continue at USC is because of the young 
men that are already in the program and those that have signed letters of 
intent. I gave the students we signed my word that I would be at USC to coach 
them and it is important that I keep that commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said he was leaning toward leaving USC, which has finished last in the 
Pacific 10 for three consecutive seasons. However, he feared it would appear 
that he had deserted a sinking ship. 
</P>
<P>
"After I started thinking about it I felt it would really hurt me from a 
professional standpoint because it would give the impression that I ran for the 
first good offer I had," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling, who has two years remaining on a five-year contract at USC, said he 
felt he would have gotten the Maryland job if he hadn't withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Lew Perkins did everything he could to try to keep me from dropping out," 
Raveling said, "but I just felt I had a moral obligation to those kids and I 
felt it would give the impression that I was running scared."

GRADY HITS PUTT TO WIN IN PLAYOFF

Wayne Grady's three-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole Sunday gave him a 
victory in the Westchester golf tournament at Harrison, N.Y. -- and his 
continued competition in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you're stuck with me, fellow," the 31-year-old Australian said after he 
beat Ronnie Black and gained his first title on the American PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Grady, who spent a half-dozen years as a dedicated globe-trotter, settled in 
the United States five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of success, however, had prompted him to consider leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make a lot of money playing in Europe and Asia now, playing the same 
caliber of golf you do here and not getting your head kicked in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory in 40 m.p.h. winds erased all thoughts of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be saying goodby now," Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
Grady, 1988 Australian Masters champion, forced the playoff when he birdied the 
final hole from about six feet. He won it with the short, uphill putt on the 
first playoff hole. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest putt possible under those circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grady and Black, who has not won since 1984, completed the regulation 72 holes 
tied at 277, seven-under par. 
</P>
<P>
Grady, who started the final round in a three-way tie for the lead, played the 
last 18 holes in one-over 72. Black, playing about a half-hour in front of the 
other contenders, made up four shots with a 68. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff, with a $180,000 prize at stake, began on the 314-yard 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody won his first major title in 20 years with a final-round 71 that 
held off fast-closing Charles Coody by two strokes in the Senior Tournament 
Players Championship at Ponte Verda, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, who won the U.S. Open in 1969 for his only official victory in 17 
seasons on the PGA Tour, clinched the victory with a birdie on the 17th hole 
and a tap-in for par on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The winner finished with a 17-under-par 271 total for four trips over the 
6,646-yard TPC at Sawgrass Valley Course, a tournament record for the $700,000 
event that will move to Dearborn, Mich., next year. 
</P>
<P>
Moody began the day with a six-shot advantage over Coody, Gary Player and Lou 
Graham but never made a serious move to put the tournament away after shooting 
a course-record 64 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He birdied No. 9 to regain the lead at the turn, then saw the edge gradually 
slip away while Coody mounted his challenge on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
Coody had three birdies and eagled No. 17 to climb the leader board with a 67 
that gave him a 273 total. Gary Player shot 68 and finished third at 274 after 
he eagled the 17th hole and birdied No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, Bob Charles, Al Geiberger, Miller Barber and Arnold Palmer tied for 
fourth at 278. Palmer shot a 67 that included an eagle on No. 17 and a birdie 
on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
Second-year player Robin Hood won her first tournament on the LPGA tour, 
shooting six birdies on the Willow Creek Golf Course en route to 16 points and 
the championship in the $400,000 Pat Bradley International at High Point, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Hood, a three-time Indiana Amateur champion who had won just $8,246 in 13 
tournaments this year, earned $62,500 for her victory.

NEWSWIRE: WARRIORS' ASSISTANT MCMAHON DIES AT 60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack McMahon, 60, who spent 36 years in the National Basketball Assn., as 
player, coach and administrator, died in his sleep Sunday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, was attending an NBA 
pre-draft camp. He also served as the team's director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever loved the game of basketball more than Jack," Warrior Coach 
Don Nelson said. "He was my first pro coach and has been one of my closest 
friends for many years. I feel blessed to have had the chance to work with him 
the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., McMahon was captain of the 1952 St. John's team 
that went 25-6 and lost in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. final to 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon played eight years in the NBA, with the Rochester Royals between 1952 
and 1955, and the St. Louis Hawks fro 1955-1960. He was a starting guard on the 
Hawks 1958 championship team. 
</P>
<P>
As head coach of the expansion Chicago Zephyrs in 1962, McMahon gave Nelson his 
chance to play in the NBA after Nelson was a third round pick out of Iowa. 
McMahon became head coach of the Cincinnati Royals in 1963, compiling a 
four-season record of 187-134. 
</P>
<P>
He also coached the the San Diego Rockets and the Pittsburgh Pipers of the 
American Basketball Assn., in addition to serving as director of player 
personnel for the Philadelphia 76ers.

The National Football League has adopted a measure that denies prospective 
owners the right to make substantial changes in a franchise before the league 
approves the new ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Morning News reported that some officials are calling the measure 
"The Jerry Jones Rule," in honor of the new Dallas Cowboy owner who purchased 
the team from H.R. (Bum) Bright on Feb. 25 and immediately made sweeping 
changes before receiving league approval on April 18.

PHILIPPINES MAY FINALLY GET SHOT AT ASIA'S BOOM; 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-JAPANESE 5-YEAR PLAN AIMS TO EASE DEBT BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A moment of opportunity may be at hand for the Philippines, the only capitalist 
country that has failed to achieve economic takeoff in East Asia, the world's 
fastest-growing region. 
</P>
<P>
A five-year multinational aid program, the first that the United States and 
Japan have joined in co-sponsoring anywhere in the world, is expected to be 
approved in early July, according to Roberto Villanueva, coordinator of the 
plan for the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
It is designed to promote foreign investment to help the Philippines cope with 
a $28.5-billion foreign debt and, at the same time, move forward economically. 
</P>
<P>
Economists point out that higher wages are reducing the competitive advantage 
that labor-intensive industries have long had in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong 
and Singapore, and that investment in Thailand is reaching the saturation 
point. In light of this, they say, it is the Philippines' turn to attract 
foreign capital and to turn out goods for export. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Interest 
</P>
<P>
Already there are signs of a step in this direction. More than 50% of the 
investment made here in 1987 and 1988 was in the export-oriented fields of 
garments and electronics, according to Jose Mario I. Cuyegkeng, an economist at 
the Center for Research and Communications here. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors who snubbed the Philippines in the past are showing interest, 
with Taiwan taking the lead. Last year the Philippines attracted two and a half 
times the foreign investment it received in 1987, and businessmen, most of them 
from Taiwan, accounted for $139.6 million, a fifth of the net total. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Concepcion Jr., secretary of trade and industry, said in an interview that 
he expects the Japanese to invest nearly $1 billion this year. He said he is 
also "looking for some $100 million" in investments by South Korean firms. 
</P>
<P>
American businessmen in the Philippines have never stopped investing, a U.S. 
diplomat said, "even in the bad years" under deposed President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Americans Bullish 
</P>
<P>
The Americans continue to be bullish on the Philippines, the diplomat said, 
adding that reinvestment by established American firms is expected to amount to 
$600 million in the three years ending in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
J. Marsh Thompson, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry here, said he is "looking for a good year in investment" from American 
newcomers. "We're giving briefings to visitors two or three mornings every 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador here, Tsuneo Tanaka, said in a recent speech that 
Japanese annual investment tripled last year, to $75 million. And Japanese 
businessmen have made several significant new moves.

<P>
Uniden, a Japanese manufacturer of communications equipment, closed an 
electronics factory in Taiwan and replaced it with one in the Philippines. 
Asahi Glass made a major investment in a joint venture, and Toyota reopened a 
plant it had closed amid the chaos of Marcos' waning years. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a turnaround here," World Bank President Barber B. Conable said 
on a recent visit, "and that is very gratifying because turnarounds are hard to 
get." 
</P>
<P>
Against a background of stagnation during Marcos' last three years in power -- 
gross national product declined in 1985, the year before his fall -- the 
economy last year expanded by 6.7%, with an inflation rate of 9%. By 
comparison, 16 other heavily indebted nations around the globe averaged less 
than 3% growth and inflation of 80%, Conable noted. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino's government is aiming at growth of 6.5% a year 
through 1992, a goal that the International Monetary Fund accepts as realistic. 
</P>
<P>
The long-promised multilateral aid package was expected to bolster Aquino's 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva announced in early June that 17 nations and 14 international 
agencies will send representatives to Tokyo July 3-5 to discuss the plan and 
make pledges to contribute to it. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, exports hit a historic high of $7 billion and will grow to $15 
billion by 1992, according to Concepcion, who calls himself a "prophet of 
boom." 
</P>
<P>
Prophets of gloom are still around in abundance, though. According to Koicihiro 
Matsuura, director of the Foreign Ministry's Economic Cooperation Bureau in 
Tokyo, the aid pipeline is clogged, with money coming in faster than Manila can 
use it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four U.S. congressmen who proposed the multilateral aid plan in 
1987, the World Bank's Conable and Philippine officials have repeatedly talked 
about the program bringing an additional $6 billion to $10 billion worth of aid 
and foreign investment to the Philippines over a five-year period, it promises 
to fall far short of that billing. 
</P>
<P>
The program, officially called "the multilateral assistance initiative," will 
gather Philippine aid programs, old and new, under the World Bank umbrella for 
coordination and is expected to encourage increased aid from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement on the U.S. bases here, American aid is expected to total 
$483.6 million in fiscal 1990, up from $305 million this year. For the 
multilateral assistance initiative, President Bush requested an extra $200 
million in the budget he submitted to Congress in February. 
</P>
<P>
Japan last year pledged $925.4 million in aid and dispatched a mission to the 
Philippines in May to determine the level of this year's aid. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita have given their personal 
support to the initiative, and Sosuke Uno, Japan's new prime minister, will 
reiterate Tokyo's intention to contribute "substantially" to it when the 
leaders of seven advanced industrial democracies gather for an annual economic 
summit in Paris in July, Matsuura said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in terms of additional aid, no more than $1 billion or $2 billion spread 
over five years can be expected, economist Cuyegkeng predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is expected to bring in new donors, including South Korea, 
Taiwan and Singapore, and will give the Philippines an international stamp of 
approval that can be expected to raise foreign investors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard Cash Needed 
</P>
<P>
But "stamps of approval won't be enough," according to Solita Collas Monsod, 
secretary of the National Economic Development Authority. "We've had stamps of 
approval all over the place since 1986." 
</P>
<P>
What the country needs, she said, "is actual hard cash that will allow us to 
improve our infrastructure . . . that will build the environment for 
private-sector investment to come in." 
</P>
<P>
Repayment of domestic and foreign debt consumes 43% of the budget and, without 
new money, a Japanese official here said, "this country would go bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
To sustain the goal of 6.5% real annual growth through 1992, Philippine 
officials estimate, the country will need at least $3 billion and perhaps as 
much as $8 billion in additional aid and foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
This year, according to Finance Secretary Vicente R. Jayme, the Philippines 
will have to repay $3.3 billion on its foreign debt, compared to a projected 
inflow of only $1.7 billion. Last year, the net outflow was $1.9 billion -- and 
that after obtaining a moratorium from foreign commercial banks on repayment of 
principle until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the multilateral assistance initiative, Monsod, the Economic 
Development Authority official, said, "more will be going out than comes in." 
</P>
<P>
Monsod recalls that 25 years ago the Philippines "exported more than South 
Korea and Taiwan put together (and) Thailand wasn't even in sight." Today, she 
said, "we're even looking Thailand in the back. . . . We flubbed it." 
</P>
<P>
Monsod blames the quarter-century of stagnation on Marcos' rule. But now, she 
said, "the opportunity is here because the growth is here, the human resources 
are here, the skills are here." 
</P>
<P>
But a quarter-century ago the level of education in the Philippines was ranked 
second only to Japan's in Asia. Now, both South Korea and Taiwan have passed 
the Philippines in this respect. Illiteracy is on the rise, and the incidence 
of poverty has more than doubled, to the point where about half the people are 
considered impoverished, Concepcion said. Crime, insurgency, labor unrest and 
political instability have all increased. 
</P>
<P>
An American who works for the Asian Development Bank said the economy has taken 
"two steps forward and one and a half steps backward" since he came to the 
Philippines in 1964 as a Peace Corps volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why things don't get better," he said. "There is a certain lack 
of discipline, of thinking of one's own family or economic unit rather than the 
national good. It's going to take a long time to pull the country up again." 
</P>
<P>
Even last year's surge, as some foreign analysts see it, represented little 
more than "surface prosperity" limited to the cities. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Conable warned Filipinos that they still face "the challenge 
of sustainable development, the deep and difficult structural problems of 
poverty . . . and the environment." He said population growth, which is 
compounding the poverty problem, will double the number of Filipinos in 30 
years to 120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's press secretary, Teodoro C. Benigno, acknowledged in February that 
little of the Philippines' economic success has trickled down to the masses. 
And Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila, recently complained in a sermon 
that the ideals of the 1986 revolution that ousted Marcos had been forgotten. 
In Aquino's presence, he charged that government officials have become 
insensitive to the needs of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The old politics," Sin said, "has come back, to the dismay of us all -- the 
positioning for power, the corruption, the grandstanding, the jet-setting, the 
influence peddling, the petty bickering. It seems we have gone back to life as 
usual, to what we really are: a nation of easygoing people, rascals, braggarts, 
thieves. It is we who are the problem."

FRESH BREEZE IN BANKING; 
</P>
<P>
NEW INSTITUTIONS FILL SPECIAL NEEDS AND GEOGRAPHICAL GAPS

<P>
Wally Bragdon, whose 2-year-old bank in Petaluma is sporting a life-size cow 
and calf in its lobby for National Dairy Month, is capitalizing on a budding 
trend in California banking. 
</P>
<P>
After some lean years, interest seems to be picking up in opening new banks in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are being created in small communities such as Petaluma and Redlands, 
where bank mergers are leaving gaps, and in urban neighborhoods where a special 
need exists, as in East Los Angeles, where a new bank is planned by a group of 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are not dramatic, and the number of applications for new banks does 
not approach the flurry of the late 1970s and early 1980s. But regulators and 
other industry watchers see the potential for considerable new banking activity 
in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly because of mergers, "Everyone had been saying we'd have 350 commercial 
banks in California by this year, and I thought that made sense," said Jon 
Joseph, a San Francisco attorney specializing in banking. "But the figure never 
dropped that low and, starting last year, we have seen a marked increase in new 
bank applications that we expect to increase." 
</P>
<P>
So instead of 350 banks, California had 433 at the end of 1988 and the number 
is expected to climb. There appear to be three primary reasons for the renewed 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Last year was profitable for the state's banks in general. A new report by 
independent analyst Stephen D. Cummings of Ventura says 1988 was the best year 
since the mid-1970s for banks in California. Performance was particularly 
strong at banks formed since 1985, according to the extensive analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the ratio of bank offices to people has changed. Regulators approved so 
many new banks earlier in the decade that California became "overbanked." 
Simply, there were more banks and branches than the population could support 
profitably. 
</P>
<P>
The imbalance has disappeared over the past few years as the big banks have 
closed hundreds of branches and the population has jumped. The State Banking 
Department reports that there are 6,300 residents for each bank office in 
California, compared to 5,200 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and perhaps most significantly, big California banks have been 
acquiring smaller independent institutions, creating gaps that local business 
people are eager to fill. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever a successful independent bank is being merged into a larger one, 
there is a strong tendency to create another new bank," said Gerry Findley, a 
banking consultant in Brea who specializes in independent banks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the acquisition of independent Bank of Redlands completed Friday 
by Pasadena-based Community Bank has motivated local people in the San 
Bernardino County community to begin organizing a new bank, Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Petaluma opened its doors in the Northern California town of about 
40,000 people on Sept. 21, 1987, soon after the local bank was acquired by a 
larger company. 
</P>
<P>
Petaluma also was changing, making the transformation from an 
agriculture-dominated economy to one that supported new businesses fleeing San 
Francisco, 30 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception of our founding directors was that they wanted a locally owned, 
locally managed bank," said Walter E. Bragdon, who had spent 19 years with 
Union Bank before he became president and a founder of the new bank. "They 
wanted a bank that could respond to the needs and wants of people here and do a 
very personalized business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sense of Community 
</P>
<P>
The cow and calf in Bank of Petaluma's lobby this month reflect that sense of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Henry B. Jamison, who spent 29 years as a banking regulator, shares Bragdon's 
view and has employed it in creating three small banks in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"A community-oriented institution that will treat people as individuals can 
still do very well," said Jamison, who is president of Marin Community Bank in 
San Rafael. The institution is expected to open later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to open later this year, in a converted auto dealership in East 
Los Angeles, is Angeles National Bank. Its organizers say it will be the first 
metropolitan area bank founded by Latinos in about 25 years, and its staff will 
be bilingual in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be focusing on the community with direct services while being 
very much aware of what the community's needs are," said Richard Amador, one of 
the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of new community banks say they are not motivated by the approach of 
full interstate banking in California in 1991. Some of the state's medium-sized 
banks and possibly its larger ones are expected to be targets for acquisition 
by the out-of-state banks that will be allowed to move into California then. 
</P>
<P>
But the new banks are regarded as too small to be noticed by a big bank trying 
to make a splash in California. In fact, a wave of acquisitions could improve 
opportunities for community banks if the public turns away from institutions 
bought by out-of-staters. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the pace of new bank approvals by the regulators picks up considerably, 
it appears unlikely to reach the pitch of the early 1980s, when 30 or more 
banks were opening each year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that in the early '80s in California anybody with 2 or 3 
million dollars got a bank charter," said Jerry B. Saylor, an official with the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators have been tougher recently, partly because of the high rate of 
failures in the savings and loan industry and less serious problems in banking. 
While FDIC officials refused to confirm it, several industry observers said the 
agency has rejected applications for at least two new banks in California in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Saylor said the agency, which insures deposits and regulates banks, wants to 
make sure that new banks are being formed where there is a legitimate economic 
need and by experienced business people with a commitment to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up a new bank can be costly. Legal and consultant fees can run to 
$50,000 with no guarantee of approval by state or national regulators. If the 
proposal is rejected, the seed money is lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Offerings Raise Capital 
</P>
<P>
Once a bank receives approval, pre-opening costs for items such as preparation 
of a stock offering, salaries and a building can easily top $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, the lawyer, said the minimum capital needed to start a bank is $1 
million, but in urban areas the figure is usually $4 million or more. The 
capital is normally raised through a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
Founding a local bank can be a source of prestige and influence, but the 
possibility for quick profits is pretty slim. Industry figures show that most 
new banks do not earn a profit until their second year, and serious problems 
often do not show up until the third year. 
</P>
<P>
"The third year is when they have to eat all the mistakes they made in the 
first two," said Findley, the consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The mistakes are mostly the result of making bad loans in an effort to increase 
an institution's business too quickly, Findley said. The new banks that stick 
to a solid business plan are the ones who avoid those errors, he said. 
</P>

NEW STATE-CHARTERED BANKS IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
Year-to-year carryovers create some discrepancies between number of approvals 
and openings in a single year.

AMWAY PRESIDENT, A SPURNED SUITOR, VOWS TO 'BEAT' AVON

<TEXT>
<P>
Amway Corp. President Richard DeVos has turned to taunting Avon Products Inc. 
for rejecting Amway's recent takeover bid, telling a company convention crowd 
that if Amway can't join them, "We'll just beat 'em." 
</P>
<P>
The thousands of Amway distributors roared in approval Saturday as DeVos joked 
the company's new motto may be "Sponsor An Avon Lady Today." 
</P>
<P>
About 7,500 of Amway's 1 million independent distributors worldwide attended 
the two-day convention at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The convention, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Ada, Mich.-based 
company, comes about a month after Amway teamed up with corporate raider Irwin 
Jacobs to buy a 10.3% stake in Avon. A week later, Amway offered to buy the New 
York-based cosmetics company for $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Avon rejected the offer, and in a series of stinging letters to Amway it 
described the direct-sales company as "marked by zealotry" and said such a 
merger "would destroy Avon's good name." 
</P>
<P>
Amway withdrew its offer, calling Avon's rejection hysterical, irresponsible 
and vicious. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll have to buy Avon, we'll just beat 'em," DeVos said. 
</P>
<P>
After a nearly evangelical speech describing Amway distributors as 
"life-enrichers," DeVos said of the Avon bid: "We were only trying to enrich 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
DeVos and Chairman Jay Van Andel founded the company in 1959 by mixing laundry 
suds in their basement. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of seeing what kind of dirt they could dig up, we could have shown 
them how to clean up," DeVos said of Avon. 
</P>
<P>
The "dirt" refers to an investigation Avon launched into Amway operations to 
fend off the bid. It turned up possible financial wrongdoings by the company's 
chief executive, William W. Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Amway also is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and

Trade Complaints Over Microchips: The Semiconductor Industry Assn. said Sony, 
Matsushita, Sanyo and Sharp are among Japanese companies that aren't buying 
enough foreign chips to satisfy an existing agreement to expand the U.S. share 
of the market. The Japanese companies that came under fire responded that they 
are trying to increase their intake of foreign chips but that U.S. firms are 
not making the kind of products they want.

Italian Banking Executive Indicted: Enrico Cuccia, 81, head of Italy's dominant 
merchant bank, Mediobanca, has been indicted by an Italian magistrate on 
charges of deceitful bookkeeping. Cuccia is accused of registering the 
equivalent of $17 million under a false heading in Mediobanca's balance sheets 
from 1976 to 1980. Investigators say the money may have been used for such 
things as employee bonuses and to improve the ailing balances of bank clients. 
Cuccia and other bank officials deny the charges.

Storehouse Rejects Edelman Bid: Storehouse PLC rejected a proposal by U.S. 
takeover specialist Asher B. Edelman that he make a friendly offer for the 
British retailer of about $1.2 billion. Edelman said he was prepared to offer 
$2.89, or 185 pence, a share for Storehouse, subject to several conditions 
including approval by Storehouse's board. But Storehouse said it wouldn't meet 
with Edelman to discuss his proposal, saying his approach "is neither an offer 
nor a firm intention to make an offer." Storehouse operates a total of about 
900 stores on both sides of the Atlantic under the names Habitat, Conran's, 
Mothercare and BHS (British Home Stores). Edelman already owns about 33 million 
Storehouse shares, or 8.1% of total shares outstanding.

India Refuses Trade Talks: India will not negotiate with the U.S. over its 
citation for violating the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act, the Press Trust of India 
reported. Last month, the United States cited India under section 301 of the 
1988 trade act for impeding direct foreign investment and closing the Indian 
insurance market to foreign firms. The law allows the United States to levy 
tariffs of 100% on Indian goods if negotiations fail to remove the barriers 
within 18 months.

THREE DIRECTORS QUIT TIME BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three directors have quit Time Inc.'s board as the company girds for a hostile 
takeover attempt by Paramount Communications Inc. that threatens to derail 
Time's plan to merge with Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remaining 12 directors on the Time board held an "informational" 
session Sunday, a source said. The mood at the half-day session was described 
as "upbeat" and the directors' views were characterized as "unanimous," 
although no action was announced. The board is expected to meet again in the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal securities law, Time has until June 21 to recommend a course of 
action to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Louis J. Slovinsky, Time's vice president of corporate communications, said 
three directors who already had announced their intention to leave Time's board 
at the next shareholders meeting -- still scheduled for June 23 -- resigned 
last week instead. The three were identified as: 
</P>
<P>
* Clifton R. Wharton Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Teachers 
Insurance and Annuity Assn.-College Retirement Equities Fund, who has served on 
the board since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
* Henry C. Goodrich, former chairman of Sonat Inc., who has served as a Time 
director since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
* Clifford J. Grum, president and chief executive of Temple-Inland Inc., a 
board member since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach the three directors were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
In April, another longtime director resigned after expressing reservations 
about the merger with Warner. Arthur Temple, former chairman of Time's divested 
Temple-Inland lumber and forestry subsidiary, said the entertainment business 
is "not a type business in which I can feel pride," according to the proxy that 
Time mailed to shareholders late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Temple, 69, voted for the merger despite his reservations. According to the 
proxy, his 3% stake in the media company is second only to that of Henry Luce 
III, the founder's son. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining Time directors include such corporate luminaries as John R. Opel, 
chairman of International Business Machines' executive committee; Xerox Corp. 
Chairman David T. Kearns, and R. H. Macy Co. Chairman Edward S. Finkelstein.

TROUBLE WITH 'TRON': A COMPUTER RIVALRY; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. SAYS JAPANESE SCIENTIST'S PROPOSAL FOR OPEN OPERATING SYSTEM MAY CREATE A 
TRADE BARRIER

Ken Sakamura dreams of a future in which billions of compatible computers link 
together the world's people, creating understanding and peace. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government says his new basic computer design, named Tron, may be 
an unfair trade barrier that restricts American access to the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura, a 37-year-old computer scientist at the University of Tokyo, says 
such charges are a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"In the current climate of trade friction, anything new and Japanese is 
considered an economic threat by people in other countries," he says. "It's 
very sad because it overlooks how Tron can help all the people of the world 
both economically and culturally." 
</P>
<P>
Tron escaped being named as a major trade barrier in the U.S. Trade 
Representative's recent report that focused on Japanese policy on imports of 
supercomputers, forestry products and satellites, but Tron remains a matter of 
concern to U.S. officials and computer firms. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura says he created Tron, a computer "architecture" or basic set of 
operating specifications, to make future computers more compatible and 
flexible, and has offered it free of charge to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
With Tron, he says, computer operations would become as standardized as the 
controls in cars, giving anyone the ability to operate virtually any computer. 
</P>
<P>
Tron, which stands for The Real-time Operating System Nucleus, also would allow 
future homes and offices to have dozens of computers linked together in a 
single network, while houses and communities could be connected into 
"intelligent cities," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In a Tron "intelligent house," Sakamura says, if the volume of the stereo 
system is turned up, a miniature computer could notify another computer, which 
would close the windows to avoid disturbing the neighbors. That computer would 
then inform a microcomputer in the air conditioner, which would turn on to keep 
the temperature from rising. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, computers could sense a child crossing the street and tell computers 
in oncoming cars to stop, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura isn't alone in his dream. In the past year, 126 computer-related 
companies, including 18 foreign firms, have joined the Tron Assn., which 
promotes his design. The list includes most of the world's leading 
semiconductor makers. 
</P>
<P>
Six Japanese manufacturers are currently developing advanced 32-bit Tron 
microprocessors, and the first full Tron computer is expected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A Tron "intelligent house" currently under construction in Tokyo by a group of 
16 companies is slated to contain 380 computers and be completed by the end of 
this year. The rice cooker, lights, telephones, baths, videocassette recorders, 
air conditioners, stereo equipment and a host of other appliances are tied 
together in a computer network for easy control. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-story, $35-million Tron "intelligent building" planned in Tokyo will 
incorporate more than 10,000 interlinked microcomputers, developers say. 
</P>
<P>
Dwarfing those projects is a computerized Tron "city" planned by 20 companies 
in Chiba prefecture outside of Tokyo. About 1,000 people are expected to live 
in the 250-acre area, expected to cost about $715 million to build. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in its preliminary report on trade 
restrictions, said moves to adopt the Tron standard in Japan could hurt sales 
of U.S. computers and give Japanese companies an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
While Japanese makers have developed Tron products, "no U.S. manufacturer is in 
a position to sell Tron-based PCs (personal computers) or telecommunications 
equipment," it said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent negotiations in Japan, U.S. trade officials said they were 
particularly concerned that Japanese government procurements that specified the 
Tron standard would place U.S. companies at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Japan's semi-private telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph 
&amp; Telephone Corp., announced that it will use the Tron standard for its 
future digital communications network. 
</P>
<P>
A committee formed by Japanese government, industry and local educational 
agencies also has set specifications for purchases of school computers which 
may give an advantage to Tron equipment, the U.S. trade report said. 
</P>
<P>
But, says Sakamura, "Tron's basic philosophy is openness, so anyone can use 
Tron specifications at no charge." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, some analysts attribute Japanese companies' enthusiasm for Tron in 
part to restrictions that U.S. semiconductor makers have placed on Japanese use 
of U.S.-developed computer microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. electronics industry source says American officials also fear that Tron 
could replace U.S.-developed operating systems such as UNIX and MS-DOS, and 
thereby reduce U.S. leadership in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some U.S. 
companies might feel it was "too much of an imposition" to adjust to Tron. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura says all computer and software firms would benefit if Tron is widely 
adopted because their products could sell anywhere, including Japan, without 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
But he says Tron's greatest contribution will be in allowing the people of the 
world to communicate more easily. 
</P>
<P>
Tron provides for 48,400 multilingual characters as well as the direct transfer 
of images, while the current ASCII standard for transferring data between 
computers provides for only 128 Roman letters, numbers and symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, a new world economic order will develop around this new culture and 
communication order, creating the foundation for cooperation and less fighting 
among peoples," Sakamura says. 
</P>
<P>
"That may sound like a dream. . . . However, I'm a computer architect, and the 
more I dream about the future, the better I can do my job of designing computer 
architecture for it."

PLACENTIA'S CHANG WINS FRENCH OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Michael Chang of Placentia became the youngest player to win 
the French Open men's singles title, defeating Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 6-1, 
3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, in the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Chang is the first American to win the French Open men's title since Tony 
Trabert in 1955 and the youngest player to win a Grand Slam men's singles title 
(victories in four major international tennis tournaments). 
</P>
<P>
Chang's victory capped an amazing run in which he upset top-seeded Ivan Lendl 
in the fourth round Monday after being down two sets and suffering from painful 
leg cramps in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was seeded 15th in the tournament, defeated Ronald Agenor Wednesday 
in the quarterfinals and Andrei Chesnokov Friday in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorable Two Weeks 
</P>
<P>
Sunday against the third-seeded Edberg, he faced 10 break points in three games 
during the fourth set but never buckled. He repeatedly scored with passing 
shots, drop shots and volleys to win the set. 
</P>
<P>
When Edberg hit a forehand into the net to end the 3-hour, 41-minute match, 
Chang threw up his arms, smiled broadly and turned to his family and coach 
sitting in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"These two weeks, regardless of what happened today, are going to stay with me 
throughout my whole life," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
At 17 years, 3 1/2 months old, Chang is six months younger than Mats Wilander 
when that player became the youngest Grand Slam men's champion by winning the 
French Open in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's title also is the first Grand Slam singles title for a U.S. man since 
John McEnroe won the U.S. Open in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the U.S. and French Open, the Grand Slam title includes victories at 
Wimbledon and the Australian Open.

O.C. AIR TERMINAL COST ISN'T OUT OF LINE; 
</P>
<P>
PROJECT IS MID-PRICED COMPARED TO SIMILAR PROJECTS, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite months of controversy about cost overruns and design changes, John 
Wayne Airport's new $50-million passenger terminal is neither cheap nor 
expensive when compared to similar projects nationally, according to an 
informal Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
A Times survey of 21 projects throughout the U.S. showed a wide price range, 
from $59 per square foot of new terminal space in Fargo, N.D., to $357 per 
square foot at Chicago's splashy new United Airlines complex. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne's new terminal is running about $148 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by controversy from the start, the terminal is part of a $310-million 
expansion program that also includes new garages, roads, bridges and airfield 
improvements -- the county's biggest public works project ever. The project has 
been beset by design errors, cost overruns, and mistakes in price estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But with the topping off of the ironwork last month, the new terminal appears 
to be progressing more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Behind Schedule 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury, in one of its periodic progress reports, last 
week warned that the project is 14 weeks behind schedule. But officials still 
predict that the new structure will be occupied by April 1, although some 
interior walls may not be painted by then and some gates may not be open to 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, issues remain, such as the siting for a million-gallon, 
above-ground fuel storage facility, business disputes between prime contractor 
Taylor Woodrow California Construction Ltd. and subcontractors, and difficulty 
in reaching the goal of 10% participation by firms owned by women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Project Manager Richard Begley: "The worst is behind us. You 
will see enormous progress from this point forward." 
</P>
<P>
Begley has contended that the problems at John Wayne hardly stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples found in The Times survey: 
</P>
<P>
* In San Jose, a soils engineering firm failed to discover an underground 
stream at the site of the city's new passenger terminal, causing delays for 
pumping. Delivery of tons of granite from Italy fell behind schedule. And an 
airport spokesman said the city is probably going to seek reimbursement from 
the architect for some errors and omissions discovered in blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
* In Nashville, Tenn., where a new $105-million facility nearly twice the size 
of the new John Wayne terminal was completed in only 21 months, two 
subcontractors went broke in mid-project. The head of the agency in charge of 
Nashville's airport expansion was embroiled in a controversy over his ownership 
of land near the airport. A fish on the endangered species list was found in a 
stream near the new terminal site, and airport neighbors have sued to block 
construction of a new runway that environmental impact documents previously 
failed to mention. 
</P>
<P>
* In Albuquerque, N.M., where a project doubling the size of the airport's 
existing terminal will be completed later this month, the sandy soil beneath 
the building shifted. The roof leaked on airline employees. The heating and 
cooling systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
* In Chicago, work began on some sections of the $500-million United Airlines 
terminal before others had been designed. The new terrazzo floor cracked. 
Construction workers went on strike. And the multimillion-dollar glass roof, 
which was reflecting blinding streams of light into the eyes of air traffic 
controllers, had to be etched with acid after it was already in place. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such problems, officials at each of these airports used phrases like 
"running smoothly" to describe their terminal-construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Problems occur, airport and airline industry officials say, because airport 
projects are large, complex, and rely on armies of workers who have trouble 
communicating. Some officials, such San Jose airport spokesman Steve Grossman, 
are fatalistic. "I believe that on almost any project you're going to find some 
of these things," he said. "But the bottom line is that, here at least, they 
have not delayed the expected completion date because you make up time as you 
go along." 
</P>
<P>
The frenzied pace of airport building is part of a national boom in terminal 
construction and remodeling due to intense competition among airlines for 
market share and a need to replace inadequate, worn-out facilities that were 
built to accommodate first-generation jetliners 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Denver, for example, plans to build a new airport at a cost of more than $2 
billion. Chicago is going through a $2-billion airport-improvement program that 
includes the recently opened, $500-million United Airlines terminal. National 
Airport in Washington and its sister airfield, Dulles International Airport, 
are jointly planning $1.2 billion in improvements. Dallas-Ft. Worth and JFK in 
New York are each planning improvements totaling more than $1 billion. Orlando, 
Fla., is in the midst of a $430-million expansion program, and San Francisco 
anticipates spending at least $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
And at Los Angeles International Airport, which was remodeled for the 1984 
Summer Olympics, Delta Airlines last year spent more than $85 million 
reconstructing its terminal, and several airlines are spending another $200 
million combined on other terminal remodeling projects. The Federal Aviation 
Administration reports that annual requests for airport development grants have 
jumped from $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion just in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We need this construction boom," says Tom Browne, manager for airport policy 
and administration at the Air Transport Assn., the industry group that 
represents air carriers. "Most everything (new) that's going in is capacity 
related. . . . There are more passengers and more planes. And some of the 
capacity gains involve replacing the old with the new." 
</P>
<P>
Air travel demand is expected to reach 750 million passenger boardings per year 
by 2001, compared to 450 million projected for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Most airport terminal construction or remodeling is financed with revenue 
bonds, which are repaid with airline landing fees and rents collected from food 
vendors and car-rental agencies. When leased airport space goes up in price due 
to remodeling or new construction, concessionaires charge the public 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
A Continental Airlines official, for example, recently stated that if Denver 
builds a new, $2.3-billion airport, it could add $36 to ticket prices for 
passengers going to or from that facility.

One industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new 
passenger terminal at John Wayne Airport could add $5 to $7 to the airlines' 
cost for each boarding passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing projects to see who is getting the most terminal for the money is 
nearly impossible, according to airport managers, contractors and airline 
industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose has almost completed a new $33-million, 225,000-square-foot terminal 
that will cost about $132 per square foot. For that price, San Jose is getting 
10 new passenger gates, vaulted ceilings, a lot of glass and a stone-clad 
exterior. In comparison, John Wayne's $50-million, 337,900-square-foot terminal 
will cost about $148 per square foot and will have 14 gates, with most of the 
same amenities. Conditions at the two construction sites are similar. 
</P>
<P>
Nashville last year added a $105-million, 750,000-square-foot, 46-gate 
terminal, for only $140 per square foot. The new terminal includes special 
facilities equipped with fax machines and word-processing services for business 
travelers. Nashville benefited from lower labor and materials costs due to 
regional economic differences that set it apart from both the West and East 
Coasts, or even the Chicago-Detroit area, contractors say. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Carlson, president of Sacramento-based Continental Heller, the general 
contractor for San Jose's new terminal, considered the John Wayne project but 
did not bid on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to cost $55 million to $60 million, not the $42 million 
that was budgeted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne, the low bid was $18 million higher than the $42 million budgeted 
by the county, leading to a major cost-cutting effort. A cost estimator said 
that contractors were overcharging. A consulting firm countered that the cost 
estimator had inaccurately priced many materials such as steel and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Because terminal designs vary, comparing costs can be difficult, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at how much renovation is going on, and whether or not the 
facility has to remain open for business while you're working," Carlson said. 
"The Orange County terminal is going to be very stylish, and that adds to the 
cost. But even that doesn't compare with Chicago, where the new United terminal 
was designed as a masterpiece by a red-hot architect (Helmut Jahn). National 
Airport in Washington, D.C., in contrast, is (going to be) a nice, simple 
building -- nothing flashy. 
</P>
<P>
"So asking what a new terminal should cost is kind of tough, says Carlson. 
"Tell me. What does an automobile cost?" 
</P>

Note: Cost data was calculated by The Times based on terminal size and expense 
information supplied by airport or airline officials. The data can mislead. For 
example, Albuquerque and Los Angeles both doubled the size of an existing 
terminal, so square footage includes old as well as new space. The remodeled 
Los Angeles terminal (Delta Airlines) utilizes more expensive materials, 
including marble and exotic tropical plants, and has more gates. But 
Albuquerque's gates are open to all airlines and serve more daily flights.

INFORMATION SOUGHT ON FATAL HIT-AND-RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim resident Sharon Rowe, 42, remained hospitalized in serious condition 
Sunday while police continued to search for a hit-and-run driver who killed her 
husband shortly before she was struck by a second car. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakewood man whose car hit Rowe was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police Sunday were seeking information about the driver who ran down 
her husband, Thomas Clifford Rowe, 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're kind of scraping" for clues right now, said Lt. Jack Jansen of 
the Anaheim police. He said he did not believe that police had any new 
information on the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, police had reported that the driver who hit Thomas Rowe was a man 35 
to 40 years old with a mustache and glasses driving "a small gray vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Jansen asked anyone with information about the accident, which occurred at 8:45 
p.m. Friday in the 100 block of South Magnolia Avenue, to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharon Rowe, who sustained multiple injuries, was expected to be 
transferred out of intensive care onto a regular ward at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange late Sunday, nursing supervisor Lillian Sondquist said.

A Saturday evening party turned ugly when one man was shot in the hip and 
another was arrested for attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gathering that went sour," Westminster police Lt. Andrew Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began quietly enough, Hall said, when victim Pablo Ramirez Diaz, 
32, of Westminster met several friends in a parking lot at 8421 15th St. to 
socialize and watch a portable TV. 
</P>
<P>
But two of the party-goers began to quarrel, Hall said, and one grabbed a 
.45-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, who was not involved in the argument, tried to get out of the way but was 
hit in the hip by a single round from the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz was taken by a friend to Humana Hospital-Westminster, where he was 
reported in stable condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the man suspected of shooting Diaz fled in his car but was arrested 
later when he returned to the area where the party was held. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it real easy when they drive back. . . . It wasn't brilliant police 
work," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of attempted murder was Eleazar Valle Rangel, 23, of 
Westminster.

<P>
MAN SURRENDERS AFTER RIFLE INCIDENT, STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 48-year-old man who shot a rifle inside a trailer on a construction site 
surrendered to county sheriff's deputies after 3 1/2 hours of negotiations, a 
sheriff's spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Marciano Sulka, who was described by deputies as "suicidal," was taken 
to Orange County Jail with a request for a psychiatric evaluation, Sgt. Richard 
Burinda said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was reported injured. The construction site is in the 27000 block of 
Paseo Espada in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Sulka was arrested on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent 
manner after his wife and daughter were forced to flee the trailer when he 
fired a rifle about 11 a.m.

POSTSCRIPT: JAIL PROGRAM GIVES INMATES SOMETHING TO BUILD WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel Perez has built concrete housing foundations since he was 14, but he 
never learned the carpentry and skills to frame a house until he was sentenced 
to Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Perez is scheduled to be released from jail today in Santa Ana, after serving a 
seven-month sentence for failure to pay child support. For six of those months, 
he took college courses in home-building. 
</P>
<P>
When he turns in his jail-issue denim uniform this morning, he will be handed a 
certificate from Rancho Santiago College that documents his achievement, just 
as if he had attended classes on the Santa Ana campus. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 38, is part of an innovative program started by the Sheriff's Department 
one year ago, in part to relieve the county's overcrowded jails by reducing 
recidivism. 
</P>
<P>
"I just picked up four or five different trades," Perez said last week. "I can 
go out and bid on a job right now, maybe try and get a framing job." 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 38, said the home-building course also helped him cope with the 
pressures of life at the minimum-security James A. Musick Branch Jail in 
Irvine. "You come in here with a bad attitude, and instead of the stress of 
sitting around, this keeps your mind busy," he said. "Stay busy, and the time 
will go faster." 
</P>
<P>
In July, the county first offered minimum- and medium-security inmates at its 
two branch jails -- Musick and the Theo Lacey jail in Orange -- the chance to 
take college-credit courses while incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
It was a perfect fit, in many ways. Instead of wasting time, inmates have a 
productive activity. Perez's framing class, for example, built a shower 
facility for Musick inmates. In the welding class, the inmates repair tools 
used at the jail, and the sewing class makes jail clothes, blankets and dolls 
for county foster children. 
</P>
<P>
Studies also show that the training increases the chances that inmates will be 
employed after release; consequently, they are less likely to return to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the instruction is coordinated by Rancho Santiago College at no cost to 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
The instructors are Sheriff's Department employees who have been trained and 
certified by the college. The state then pays the college, based on enrollment, 
and the college forwards money to the county for instructor pay and class 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bartosiewski, supervisor of corrections programs for the Sheriff's 
Department, said there has been a waiting list for each class since the program 
started. Besides framing, cabinetmaking, sewing and welding have been offered 
to 436 male and female inmates. 
</P>
<P>
But jail overcrowding has caused problems for the new program. Most of those 
who start the courses never finish them in jail, because the overcrowding 
forces the Sheriff's Department to release many inmates early. 
</P>
<P>
Bartosiewski said inmates at Musick are serving only about 57% of their 
sentences because of early releases and time off for good behavior. As a 
result, of the 436 who started the classes, just 73 received their certificates 
while still in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Another 112 requested copies of their transcripts so they could continue the 
courses outside, he said. But the county does not have records of how many 
eventually graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Still, officials consider the program a success. The program even received an 
award last month from the National Assn. of Counties for "ingenuity and 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
The county and college hope to expand the courses next year. John Nixon, 
associate dean of continuing eduction at Rancho Santiago, said 
intermediate-level courses are planned, in addition to the subjects already 
taught at the jail. And the college is considering several new courses, 
including commercial food services and horticulture. 
</P>
<P>
The college is deciding what courses to offer based on labor market surveys of 
the area. The county's rapid growth has created a need for construction 
workers. Also, surveys show that jobs are available in restaurants and office 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The horticulture class, for example, would teach inmates how to maintain office 
plants. Nixon said students would learn what plants need sun or shade, plant 
grafting and horticulture terminology. 
</P>
<P>
"The information we're getting is that they're having a tough time finding 
these kind of people out there," Nixon said. "Twenty-five years ago, 
agriculture would have been the demand market."

DOG FINALLY CAPTURES BOMB-SCARE SUSPECT AFTER LONG STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach man who allegedly said he had a bomb held off 30 police 
officers for four hours late Saturday and early Sunday, despite a tear-gas 
barrage. But when a police dog finally captured him, no bomb was found. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Musser Johnston, 54, was being held on $10,000 bail in the jail ward of 
United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana on suspicion of making a false report 
of planting a bomb, Newport Beach Lt. Don Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston withstood about 24 plastic tear-gas darts, which were fired into his 
car with a 12-gauge shotgun, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 9 p.m. Saturday, when Johnston parked his car in the West 
Cliff Plaza parking lot and allegedly told a passer-by that he had a bomb, 
Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived five minutes later, Johnston reportedly refused to get out 
of his car and continued to maintain that he had a bomb, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
As Costa Mesa police officers and the Orange County Sheriff's Department bomb 
squad arrived, Newport Beach police evacuated a nearby Hughes Market, sealed 
off the parking lot and tried to talk to Johnston over a loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff continued until just before midnight, when Johnston started his 
car and tried to leave, but a police sharpshooter stationed on the roof of the 
Balboa Savings building immobilized the car, shooting out a tire and shooting a 
bullet into the engine, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Surrender 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach police then fired tear gas into Johnston's car, but he still 
refused to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Chandler said, at about 1:15 a.m. Sunday, Johnston left his car and a 
Costa Mesa police dog captured him. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated at the scene for a dog bite and exposure to tear gas and taken 
to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach for emergency treatment. Johnston was then 
taken to the jail ward at Western Medical Center, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb technicians examining his car found clothing and other personal belongings 
but no hazardous device, Chandler said.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: ANGELS TURN TO WITT TO END PAIR OF SLUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Losers of four consecutive games, five of their last six, the slumping Angels 
now place their hopes on the slumping shoulders of Mike Witt, who returns to 
the mound tonight against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
In past seasons, Witt simply would have pulled out his tool box and righted all 
wrongs with that Mercedes-Benz curveball of his or a fastball that whizzed past 
the corners of home plates everywhere. It was a sight to behold. 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 through 1987, Witt was the Angels' sure thing, the stoic constant. 
Smug looks by Angel management were big on the days Witt stalked onto the 
field. Witt meant a win. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. Smugness has been replaced by wonder, a sense of nervous 
anticipation. Sure thing? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's Mercedes-Benz is now a Buick. His fastball whizzes off bats instead of 
plopping into catcher's mitts. Something is wrong, but no one -- Witt, Manager 
Doug Rader, pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, teammates -- knows exactly what it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Now Witt, a disappointing 3-6, finds himself being asked to reattach the wheels 
to a suddenly suspect Angel bandwagon. The bullpen is giving up game-winning 
home runs as if it receives commissions for long balls -- two in the last two 
days, including Sunday's gopher ball to Royal catcher and Angel-killer Bob 
Boone; the offense, except for the recently revived Wally Joyner, is on 
extended AWOL and the starting pitching is beginning to falter. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, all is fine. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, perhaps by accident, have done what they can to improve Witt's 
chances for success. They bumped him back a day in the rotation, choosing to 
start rookie Jim Abbott Sunday against the Royals. "We just didn't want two 
left-handers back-to-back," said Lachemann of a rotation that would have had 
Abbott and fellow lefty Chuck Finley pitching on consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
We'll buy that. But by tinkering with the rotation, the Angels positioned Witt 
to face the Rangers, a team he has beaten like a snare drum: 3-0, 1.80 
earned-run average against Texas last year, 11-4, 2.99 ERA during his career. 
Coincidence? Doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Witt needs a victory worse than the Angels do. He is 19-30 since Aug. 3, 1987. 
In his last eight starts, Witt is 1-4 with three no-decisions. Opponents are 
hitting .303 against him. And to complete the statistics barrage, Witt recently 
has stopped Angel win streaks of five, four, two and two games. 
</P>
<P>
Witt knows all this. He is so accustomed to near perfection that mediocrity 
offends his sensibilities. By his own admission, he is struggling to 
re-establish himself and his waning confidence. What a battle that must be. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, maybe Witt's closest friend on the team, went through it 
earlier this spring. Nothing would go as planned. Every mistake pitch was 
lofted over the wall for a homer. Every break went the other way. It was 
frustration personified, a self-doubtathon. 
</P>
<P>
Now McCaskill watches as Witt attempts to squirm out of similar circumstances. 
"And it might be a little harder on (Witt) because the expectations on him are 
possibly greater than anyone else," McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
True enough. You became spoiled watching Witt pitch. You figured 16-20 
victories a year, 225 innings or so, 175-plus strikeouts, an ERA in the twos or 
low threes. At the very least, you figured consistency. 
</P>
<P>
That's part of the problem, McCaskill said. People forget that Witt's right arm 
has been due for a slump, too. Hard to corner the perfection market forever, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's a confidence thing," McCaskill said. "As soon as there's a 
shred of doubt in your mind, you lose your aggressiveness, or whatever they 
call it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going to take one thing for it to click again. As soon as it does, 
he'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels aren't panicking, at least, not publicly. No Fernando-South is this. 
Instead, the Angels preach patience. On occasion, they also become a bit testy 
about the subject of Witt. The less said the better, according to the Rader 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
But how can you ignore the troubles of an opening day starter? You can't, which 
is why tonight's game against the Rangers is so vital for Witt. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that it would stop an Angel losing streak, the longest of the season. Of 
greater consequence is what it would do for Witt's self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (all starts) are important," Lachemann said. "But they obviously 
become a little more important when you're struggling." 
</P>
<P>
Witt has watched more videos than Siskel and Ebert, all in hopes of picking up 
some technical glitch in his delivery. He has replayed pitch after pitch in his 
mind. Still no true answer. 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann said he thinks the problems are mechanical in nature. An adjustment 
here, an adjustment there. The goal is to make Witt's motion as consistent as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's still a matter of feeling confident, maybe catching a few breaks," 
Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Witt will try tonight. Whatever he lacks in social graces, he 
makes up in blue-flame intensity. It is his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
And whatever the Angels lack in smug looks these days, they make up in hope and 
crossed fingers. It is fast becoming their trademark.

WOMEN WITHOUT BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Coast section of the Women's Convoy to Central America arrives today 
in Los Angeles. Having started in Seattle, 18 women will stop first at the 
House of Ruth, a shelter for battered women in Boyle Heights, said Mollie 
Lowery, a local convoy organizer. 
</P>
<P>
The convoyistas, as the women sometimes call themselves, will help relandscape 
the shelter's back yard, lunch with residents and drive to Temple Shir Shalom 
in Mar Vista, where they will be guests at a potluck supper given by the temple 
and St. Bede's Episcopal Church. The women will camp at the temple, then head 
for Texas in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
There, 73 women and 23 trucks, buses, and vans from across the United States 
will converge in Austin before heading across the border for Mexico, Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
With the slogan "Between women there are no boundaries" as their rallying 
point, the women -- supported and organized by hundreds of others -- will head 
off for five weeks on a combination grand adventure and noble mission. They are 
bringing "solidarity and material aid" to 20 grass-roots women's groups in 
towns and cities in the five countries. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by a steering committee that included North and Central American 
women, the convoyistas are "a good mix of color, age, money, class, sexual 
preference and religion," Lowery said. "There was a real conscious effort to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
There also has been an effort to bring aid specifically requested by the 
foreign grass-roots groups -- items such as medical supplies, typewriters, 
educational materials, kitchen equipment, sewing supplies and the vehicles 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The combined cargo, Lowery estimated, is worth upwards of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The women have learned, Lowery said, from the experience of several peace 
convoys on similar, previous missions and have backup plans for difficult 
border crossings, legal or mechanical troubles. 
</P>
<P>
While this diverse group is not talking much about regional politics, most of 
the women describe themselves as being opposed to U.S. military intervention in 
Central America. More on their minds is a different type of political talk -- 
the politics of oppression, or domination, that affect all women. They are full 
of talk of solidarity, support, empowerment, networking. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I do?" Ariana Manov echoes the question. "There is no short answer." 
</P>
<P>
One of the three Los Angeles women going on the convoy, Manov is a journalist 
who co-hosts and co-produces, with Joseph Megel, KPFK's "Morning Magazine." She 
is a mental health counselor for three shelters for homeless women and 
children; she is a teacher and guest lecturer on domestic violence; she is an 
activist who "as a fat woman" engages in what she calls body politics -- "how 
we're manipulated by appearances -- it's a form of cultural imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Western Europe, where her father worked for NATO, she is, she said, 
"sort of an old dinosaur of an activist," influenced first by Britain's Ban the 
Bomb movement of the '50s. Back home, she was "involved in the freedom rides," 
responding to what she calls the "clicks of consciousness, becoming aware not 
that there is injustice in the world, but that it is deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of UCLA in sociocultural anthropology, she has at age 42 worked in 
social services for variously disenfranchised people for 25 years. She shares a 
house in Venice with Mollie Lowery, and, for 10 years, Manov's mother, 
physically and mentally incapacitated by Alzheimer's disease and related 
debilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although this is her first convoy, Manov -- fluent in Spanish -- is no stranger 
to travel in Central America. Thus, she said, she finds herself on the convoy's 
"border-crossing team," a potentially delicate assignment that may, she 
acknowledges, necessitate considerable negotiating skills. "I couldn't be doing 
this without the help of about 50 friends who've given me money," she said of 
the trip. Also Lowery and another friend will be responsible for her mother's 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of other efforts that illustrate we no longer live in a world 
where we can say "them/us. This is one very small planet." 
</P>
<P>
Why this particular trip? "The fact that it's all women, I think. It's an 
unparalleled opportunity to bring North and Central American women together in 
solidarity. There's a sense we truly mean it, that there are no boundaries. 
It's a celebration of that spirit and what we can create. I don't want to 
romanticize it. Things can be difficult. . . . And I'm just talking about the 
women on the convoy itself. Not to mention it's the rainy season -- hot, wet 
and mosquitoes." 
</P>
<P>
The Honda Civic in the driveway of this lovely San Marino home has KO AIDS on 
the license plate. Buttons of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, pictures of the late 
Catholic activist Dorothy Day, ads against handguns and for condoms are on the 
kitchen bulletin board and taped to the refrigerator. Alongside the pool and 
the Ping-Pong table in the back yard is a mural of a female cartoon character 
from "The Far Side" with "Born to Be Wild" emblazoned on it. 
</P>
<P>
An activist lives here. Her name is Mary Nalick. She is: a lawyer who has 
worked with the mentally ill and homeless on Skid Row; a spring graduate of 
USC's School of Social Work who is a counselor and advocate for AIDS Project 
L.A. (APLA); a supporter of the Los Angeles Catholic Worker community who stood 
with them every Monday morning for 1 1/2 years on the corner of 6th and Hope 
streets from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m. demonstrating against U.S. military intervention 
in Central America; an anti-nuclear protester who got arrested at the test site 
in Nevada. She has also been married for 25 years. She and her husband, 
Richard, a physician, have four grown sons. 
</P>
<P>
She delivers a lickety-split run-through of her 45-year life history by 
starting out: "I was born in Pasadena. I've not gotten very far." 
</P>
<P>
She dropped out of college after one semester, got married and worked as a 
medical secretary while her husband finished medical school, then started 
having babies. Her activist phase started when her husband got drafted as a 
doctor and ordered to Vietnam. She wanted to go to Canada; he convinced her it 
was only as a doctor that he would go. She accepted that. He went to Vietnam 
and she went into action. 
</P>
<P>
"I was furious (that he was drafted). I was not a nice person at that time. . . 
. I decided the world was going crazy and I wanted to change it. I decided to 
go to law school." 
</P>
<P>
Now that she also has finished social work school, she said, her priority will 
probably be to continue working with people with AIDS, she said. "When I was 
interviewed at APLA I was asked if I was homophobic. I said, 'I'm probably 
homo-ignorant. I'm a San Marino housewife.' They were wonderful with me. Very 
tolerant." 
</P>
<P>
Her activism won't stop there, however. As a graduation present to herself, she 
had intended to go to Cuernavaca in Mexico to study Spanish for a month. Then 
she heard about the convoy and changed her plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a lot more meaningful. I have a ton of reasons for going, selfish 
and unselfish. Growing and learning, being able to contribute something. I 
think it's going to be the trip of a lifetime, probably life-changing. You 
can't help but be more active around this issue having done this. When I get 
back I'm going to take the month of August off. Come September, I'm going to 
think about the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Edna Williams is the associate director of LAMP, the Los Angeles Men's Place, a 
project that serves chronically mentally ill homeless men on Skid Row. A sunny, 
laughing woman who greets the world with great enthusiasm and warmth, she says 
she does paper work at LAMP, cleans the place, develops programs and cooks. 
</P>
<P>
One recent Saturday morning, she stood in the kitchen at the center waiting for 
six fresh-from-the-oven mince pies to cool. "Out of the box, into the oven. 
That kind of mince pie. Nothing impressive," she hastened to explain. 
</P>
<P>
She has worked at LAMP for the past two years, she said, adding, by way of 
background, that she was born in St. Kitts in the Caribbean, lived in England 
for several years and moved to New York. There she went to school, and, since 
1972, worked in the field of mental health, sometimes doing dance and 
recreational therapy. Now 40, she has been in Los Angeles for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to work with the young mentally ill who are very active and resistive 
to the traditional mental health system. I'm a very active, energetic person," 
she said, explaining that it gave her an empathy with them. "I think it's why 
I'm on Skid Row. These men have a tremendous amount of energy and coping 
ability. They can use that in another way, a way that is more nurturing and 
care-taking." 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a convoyista is a new experience, she said with a grin, especially her 
assignment to drive a one-ton diesel truck. But she is no stranger to social 
action. In New York, she was involved in the "black movement," worked in Harlem 
for gang and delinquency prevention, and since the '70s has been an advocate 
for patients' rights for the mentally ill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She had not been involved much with Central-American issues, she said, but 
became interested in the convoy through Lowery, who directs LAMP. Now she is 
itching to go and has raised the $1,000 fee with the help of family and 
friends, a number of whom had a fund-raising party for her. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a connection with being from the Caribbean," she said of her desire to 
go. "Also I want to learn about those folks there, get to know their culture, 
help them as they start empowering themselves. One group in Chiapas (in Mexico) 
asked for a lot of kitchen stuff. They want to start a preschool for kids and 
have a kitchen in it. So a lot of our supplies are for that. 
</P>
<P>
"These are grass-roots organizations trying to make a change in an aggressive, 
positive manner. We want to be supportive. They're in a difficult time and 
situation."

ASPARTAME HAS AMA SEAL OF APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I was out with some friends recently and I used an artificial 
sweetener, aspartame, for my tea, and one of the other people at the table 
remarked that it was not healthy to use it. I'm usually very careful about what 
I eat, and I was surprised by this comment. I've been under the impression that 
aspartame is safe to use. Have I been wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The American Medical Assn. has accepted aspartame as safe to use in 
normal amounts. Of course, this does not preclude the possibility that a 
particular individual may be sensitive to the product. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My sister just celebrated her 70th birthday, and she mentioned to me that 
her doctor told her that her blood glucose level was high but that she did not 
have to do anything about it. Shouldn't she be getting some form of treatment? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm not certain what your sister meant by "high." The safe range for blood 
glucose levels increases as a person grows older. Your sister's blood glucose 
may be "high" in comparison with that of a younger person, but perfectly normal 
for someone her age. If that's the case, there is no need for any treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I tried breaking in a pair of new shoes, but I developed a corn and now 
can't wear the shoes. Was it the shoes that caused the corn? What kind of 
treatment would you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
A: A corn may form when a spot on the foot is subject to rubbing over a period 
of time. Eventually, the skin thickens in an effort to protect the area; 
however, the thickened skin also results in greater pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Untreated corns may crack, and this, in turn, may lead to infection. A 
podiatrist can safely remove the corns. Over-the-counter preparations are not 
recommended.

NOVELIST GAMBLES WITH COSMOS IN A GIRL'S HEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
The Blue Nature by Suzanne Hamilton Free (St. Martin's: $19.95; 418 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Nature" suffers from a flaw that only the very best first novels 
carry. There's too much stuff in it; the author's reach has far exceeded her 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
This is really two novels; the author writes every sentence as if it were her 
very last chance to reach out to the reader, and so on and so forth. These 
symptoms, these "flaws," if you will, mean that "The Blue Nature" does not read 
easily. For all that, it's wonderfully moving, wonderfully interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Free has thrown craft and caution and even plausibility to the winds, 
taken what must be her own deal of the cosmic cards, and tried to make sense of 
the whole jumble in novel form. This is a woman yelling out into the void -- if 
I read correctly -- "This is how it all seems to me! Does any of this ring a 
bell with any of the rest of you?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Nature" is about Maddie (and note the obvious symbolism of that 
name), a young girl in a moderately remarkable family, whose glamorous, 
melancholy bachelor uncle, Deane, leaves home every few years to go off 
exploring in the Frozen North. Although his married brother, Willy, sees these 
expeditions as "slow treks from nowhere to nowhere," Deane knows them to be his 
salvation, a place of primary colors and primary emotions. The boys' mother, 
Maddie's grandmother, Bert, has described Deane as having a "blue nature," or 
"blue genes," pleasing family euphemisms for what will show up in Part 2 of 
this book as severe clinical depression. 
</P>
<P>
You can see, that's a lot for a first novel to carry: A cast of about 20 
characters, including two separate families, all of Maddie's childhood kinfolk: 
Her Grandma Bert (and an ordinary grandpa), her glamorous Uncle Deane and 
stalwart dad (and her ordinary mom), a sister, Katy, born for doom, and some 
others. Then, in Part 2, Maddie's husband, quite ordinary Nate, Maddie's three 
children, her doctor, and, still, the ghost of Deane, who in some terrible 
twinkling of an eye long ago, went down, got lost, disappeared in Alaskan 
wastes -- no one knows how. Deane's notes and artifacts remain, and an Eskimo 
mask, with holes in its hands, which somehow carries both hope and loss. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this mix about 100 religious questions. Uncle Dean is, if anything, an 
animist, finding the sacred in the Earth itself. Maddie's Aunt Essie is a 
simple fundamentalist, believing in Jesus, and dismissing everyone who doesn't 
as a Communist. When Maddie hits 14, her own melancholy nature responds to a 
Presbyterian service of Tenebrae, that moment of theological darkness on Maundy 
Thursday when all the lights are snuffed out, and God, for awhile, is seen to 
be truly dead. (Do Presbyterians even celebrate this ritual? Even in serious 
Catholicism, you don't see it very often. But the author needs theological 
darkness to correspond with emotional darkness, and so Tenebrae becomes a 
serious symbolic part of this novel.) 
</P>
<P>
In Part 2, an adult Maddie battles terrible attacks of clinical depression. The 
minister she's married to is absent most of the time, courting new members of 
the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
This book is close to life. Credit is given in the last pages to Rodgers Dean 
Hamilton's "The Mask With Holes in Its Hands" and to Bertha Lynwood Hamilton's 
"To a Very Little Girl." These are real people, the obvious ancestors of 
fictional Uncle Deane and Grandma Bert. To make art out of life is always a 
hassle, and Suzanne Free has arm-wrestled her "reality" to an honorable draw. 
This book is well worth the money.

REPORT ADDRESSES CHANGING NEEDS OF FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's all in the family -- wrenching conflicts between responsibilities at home 
and workplace demands, disintegrating support systems and, for the first time, 
the specter of the next generation being downwardly mobile. 
</P>
<P>
That was the message from the Legislature's year-old Joint Select Task Force on 
the Changing Family, whose first report, "Planning a Family Policy for 
California," was presented by co-chairs, State Sen. Diane E. Watson and 
Assemblyman Thomas H. Bates. 
</P>
<P>
The California family is in trouble and the report is "an urgent call to 
action," Watson said at a breakfast Friday in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Bates asked for a public "outcry" demanding that outmoded policies be updated 
and that unresponsive institutions act to meet identified challenges. These 
challenges include an increasing minority population, a growing gap between 
rich and poor, and a diversity of families that bear little resemblance to the 
nuclear family of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends creation of a State Office of Family and Work to assist 
in developing family-friendly work policies, such as flextime and job-protected 
family leave after a birth or adoption. And it suggests that, in the awarding 
of state contracts, preference be given to bidders with pro-family employment 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expansion of subsidized child care for the low-income. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Creation of adult day-care centers and increased in-home professional 
support for care-givers to the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establishment of a network of state-funded programs to provide 
multicultural and multilingual parenting education and support services. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Comprehensive state-funded services, including child care, continuing 
education, health care and vocational counseling, for teen-age mothers and 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A study to determine the best way to ensure physical and mental health 
coverage for all families; this should be followed by a statewide program, with 
families paying a manageable share. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A "Vesper Marriage Act" as an option for those 60 and older, recognizing 
them as married "except for the purpose of taxation, inheritance and the 
receipt of pension benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Child-support payments tied to the cost of living, with a provision that 
the state make payments if a parent defaults, then seek repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expansion of subsidized preschool programs such as Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A statewide elder volunteer action corps matching retirees' interests with 
community needs. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this is going to cost a good deal of money," said task force member 
Leonard Schneiderman, dean of the UCLA School of Social Welfare. But, he 
emphasized, "nothing is more ludicrous" than the belief that cutting back on 
social programs saves money. 
</P>
<P>
There are "three compelling reasons," he said, to spend the money for 
family-oriented programs: to maintain a competitive economy; to lessen the 
polarization between the haves and have-nots; and to prevent diminishment of 
the society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"We are moving very rapidly toward two tiers in everything we do," including 
education, health care and jobs, Schneiderman said, cautioning that "there is a 
limit to deprivation" before the deprived begin to act out. 
</P>
<P>
Watson acknowledged that "we don't have the resources" to implement the 
report's recommendations. Both she and Bates said they favored shifting state 
spending and increasing taxes, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work on Changing Attitudes 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too late" to turn things around, Watson said. "We just have to work 
on changing attitudes before the problems become problems that we all have to 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics cited in the report point up how dramatically the California family 
has veered from the "Ozzie and Harriet" model of 30 years ago: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fewer than 1 in 10 families consist of the traditional model of breadwinner 
father, homemaker mother and two or more children. Today there are domestic 
partnerships without marriage, either hetero- or homosexual; extended families; 
and single-parent families. One recommendation is to outlaw insurance practices 
that discriminate against unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 63% of mothers in two-parent families work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Almost one-fourth of California children live in poverty, a rate that has 
almost doubled since 1969. As the economy has shifted from manufacturing to 
services, real wages have declined as well as benefits such as health insurance 
and private pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the year 2000, Latinos will comprise 27% of the state's population, 
Asians will be 12%, blacks, 8%. The white population will decline to 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "How families fare deeply affects how the state fares," the report states. 
It emphasizes that "paid work and family care-giving are equally important" and 
ways must be found to integrate them -- with policies that enhance, rather than 
replace, family resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defining Family Functions 
</P>
<P>
The task force did not attempt to define "the family." Rather, it defined its 
functions: To take care of the emotional and physical needs of its own; provide 
them with love and security; shape their values and social skills; and provide 
a haven from outside stresses. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis is not on AIDS or drug abuse or gang violence but on nitty-gritty, 
everyday dilemmas such as finding time to sit down as a family to dinner, help 
with the children's homework and get to know their friends. The report notes 
that time spent with the children in a grocery line or a traffic jam is not 
quality time. 
</P>
<P>
Help is needed because "conventional support systems are unraveling," the 
report points out. Today's California family may live hundreds of miles from 
relatives, is apt not to know its neighbors and may move frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it states, "Hard work is no longer necessarily a route out of poverty 
for many families." The immigrant population tends to be segregated into 
low-end jobs, its children into inner-city schools where they are 
"undereducated." 
</P>
<P>
"The pressures on today's families will not fade away," the report concludes, 
but the family will endure as an institution and needs help to solve the 
problems that threaten its health and stability. It asks: "If the public will 
not lobby for the family, who will?" 
</P>
<P>
The task force includes educators, members of the religious community, labor, 
family law and business and representatives of social service agencies. The 
task force will hold its first public hearing on its recommendations June 23 in 
Oakland.

ROCK AND A HARD PLACE;

COMMUNITIES, CLUBS SQUARE OFF OVER NOISE, ROWDINESS

<P>
The way Scott Hunt sees it, his Long Beach neighborhood isn't big enough for 
both his condominium and Fender's International Grand Ballroom, a music club 
that showcases punk and thrash-metal bands on weekends. And Hunt has no plans 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a fundamental right to peace and quiet in my home," he said, sounding 
like a gunfighter as he prepared for the showdown coming June 20 when the Long 
Beach City Council holds a hearing to determine whether to revoke the operating 
licenses held by club owner John Fender. 
</P>
<P>
"Fender has a right to run a business," said Hunt, a 28-year-old accountant. 
"But when he interferes with my rights, he has to change. When he violates 
that, he can be shut down, and that's what we're going after." 
</P>
<P>
One recent show at Fender's by the band Cro-Mags attracted a group of 
white-supremacist skinheads (though the band disavows any connection) and a 
concurrent anti-skinhead protest. And last year a skirmish between rock fans 
and the Long Beach police occured when a concert in a small side room off the 
main ballroom was closed for being overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
But while Hunt's concerned about those kind of troubles, what has him in his 
fighting mood is more the ongoing problems with parking, loitering and trash he 
says comes from the rock shows. 
</P>
<P>
But Fender, too, is ready for a fight. Heading to the hearing with "four of the 
best attorneys in town," the real estate developer and club owner is intent on 
showing that he has been singled out as the target of a crusade to achieve the 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they want is nothing going on in this neighborhood," he said. "No 
traffic whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, it will be the latest of several recent moves against rock 
venues in the Southland, making some promoters wonder whether rock is an 
endangered species here: 
</P>
<P>
*Last month Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation in effect 
halted rock shows at the 1,200-seat John Anson Ford Theatre in Hollywood by 
terminating a contract with H and D Entertainment, which had been sponsoring 
concerts at the Ford for more than a year. Among the problems cited by county 
officials: sound from a Ramones concert last summer disturbed patrons of the 
nearby Hollywood Bowl, causing the Bowl to pay more than $16,000 in ticket 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
John Webber, who oversees the theater for the Department of Parks and 
Recreation, said that the Ford will be used in coming weeks for such events as 
a Korean music festival and a Shakespeare play, but "no hard rock." 
</P>
<P>
*A permit-parking only regulation was recently instituted by the City of West 
Hollywood for residential streets near The Whisky, the Roxy and Gazzari's rock 
clubs, all within a three-block stretch on the Sunset Strip. The intent, 
according to West Hollywood Councilman John Heilman: keep rock fans out of 
residents' yards. 
</P>
<P>
* In November, the Country Club in Reseda was barred from serving liquor when 
the Los Angeles City Council denied a renewal of the club's dance permit after 
11 years of mounting complaints from neighbors about everything from noise and 
vandalism to sex acts on their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
* Laguna Beach's Club Postnuclear is barely surviving after a request for a 
permit to sell beer was denied four months ago due largely to fears from nearby 
residents that beer would attract a rowdy element. That underscored the pattern 
in Orange County of rock clubs being closed or restricted due to friction with 
neighbors, including the 1986 closings of Safari Sam's in Huntington Beach and 
Radio City in Anaheim. On a bigger scale, five years' worth of complaints about 
noise disturbing neighbors of the outdoor Pacific Amphitheatre led a judge to 
order monitoring of sound levels this season in order to determine if 
restrictions should be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, similar closings or restrictions of rock bookings have occured 
with venues ranging from the now-defunct Starwood club in Hollywood to the Rose 
Bowl in a wealthy Pasadena neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
One of the concert promoters most affected by these actions is Goldenvoice 
Productions, an Orange County-based firm that has used the Country Club, 
Fender's, the Roxy, the Whisky and worked with H and D putting on shows at the 
John Anson Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm constantly having to look for new venues to put these shows on," said 
Goldenvoice head Gary Tovar. "We're always on the move. We're still plugging 
away, but it's getting harder to find places to play. I'm getting tired of 
this. " 
</P>
<P>
Concurred Fender: "We're looking for a facility that would be accepted in the 
community, but we've yet to find one. I don't know what's going to happen when 
there aren't any places for the bands to play." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hurowitz, the Country Club's general manager, sees the same consequences 
looming. Though the Country Club has survived, slowly convincing bands and 
promoters that liquor is not necessarily needed as an attraction to rock fans, 
Hurowitz said the club cannot make much money this way and doesn't know how 
long it can last. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens when we all close up?" he said. "Where are the bands going to 
develop? Where are people going to go on Saturday night? It's a shame the city 
can't mediate with these people." 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus, whose Third District includes the 
Country Club and its neighbors, and Long Beach City Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude insist that there has been plenty of mediation. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue was the failure of the owners to adequately protect the neighbors 
from the customers," she said, claiming that the club was given plenty of 
chances to address the problems. "I believe the (club and residents) could have 
coexisted in this case had the Country Club owners been willing to make the 
investment to be good neighbors. But they never made a real commitment to it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Braude: "Consistently Fender has told me that certain things would be done 
to minimize the anguish of the residents in the area -- the constant loitering 
of patrons, the urinating, throwing of bottles and beer cans into the bushes, 
the annoying of passers-by." 
</P>
<P>
Both club operators deny their culpability, claiming that the complaints are 
inflated rantings from community cranks and blame much of the noise and 
vandalism on people not connected with the club and claiming that they maintain 
a security force more than adequate for policing the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
"We never felt we had a problem with the neighborhood, at least not for the two 
and a half years I've been here," Hurowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But one nearby resident, who asked not to be named, said the disturbances never 
happened before the club opened 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor said that a period late last year after the club's license was 
not renewed and the activity dwindled to two or three nights a week was a 
welcomed respite. Informed that the club was booked for five nights a week 
through the summer, the neighbor said with a sigh, "You've just ruined my day." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Fender claims that Braude and Hunt, who lives in a condominium in 
the old Lafayette Hotel that also houses Fender's Ballroom, as blaming him for 
problems that extend beyond his responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a group of residents, one guy in particular (Hunt), and they're 
determined to close every aspect of my business down," Fender said. "But we're 
in downtown Long Beach and have only one show a week, while the area's got 
problems seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
Braude and Hunt agree that not all the problems in the area can be attributed 
to the rock club. But they do point fingers at other Fender-owned operations in 
the area, including a bar and grill and several rental party rooms in the 
Lafayette as the source of other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Braude sees only one solution: "Hopefully we'll go forward to the day I 
can go to the residents and say, 'You don't have John Fender to kick around any 
more.' "

A LOT OF HUSH, TOO LITTLE RUSH FOR COWBOY JUNKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Shhhhh." 
</P>
<P>
That's what was printed on Cowboy Junkies souvenir T-shirts for sale Friday 
night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, where the Canadian band was 
making its first appearance in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual slogan for a rock band, but one that was true enough: "Shhhhh" 
pretty well states the method of a group that has won acclaim for bringing a 
kind of hush back into pop music. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coach House, Cowboy Junkies demonstrated the considerable virtues -- but 
also fell at times into the obvious pitfalls -- of restraining sound and 
emotional expression to the point where they almost seem to be held inside. 
</P>
<P>
The resounding eloquence of quietness has seldom been better illuminated than 
in the Toronto band's version of Neil Young's "Powderfinger." Played as an 
encore during the 90-minute early show, the song provided one of those 
transcendent, unforgettable moments that are a music fan's Grail. 
</P>
<P>
Young's original is a full-bore countrified rocker, a classic song with an 
exploding riff that is one of the signal expressive events in the annals of 
rock 'n' roll guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboy Junkies played "Powderfinger" as a quiet, Appalachian-flavored folk 
ballad. 
</P>
<P>
It featured mandolin and an accordion that turned the rawness of Young's 
original riff into caressing softness that gave comfort to Margo Timmins' 
tremulous yet dignified singing. 
</P>
<P>
Thus muted and stripped down, the Cowboy Junkies' inspired interpretation got 
to the psychological and narrative core of "Powderfinger," a mythic song about 
a young man confronting something beyond his experience, something that can't 
be comprehended, much less controlled. In the song, the youth acts on instinct 
and feeling, challenging that mysterious something -- a sinister gunboat -- and 
dying in the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Timmins' fitting dedication to "the people in the streets of China" added to 
the deep grace and emotional tug of the song. (What's really incomprehensible 
is how some swine in the audience could yell "Party!" midway through this 
pearl.) 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboy Junkies' muted approach was not always appropriate, such as their 
failed attempt at the Rolling Stones song "Dead Flowers," about someone lashing 
out fearsomely over romantic rejection. In the original, making a wrongdoing 
lover bleed with mocking words was not nearly enough for Mick Jagger. He was 
going to dope himself with heroin as well, as if defiant self-destruction would 
be the ultimate revenge. 
</P>
<P>
A staid reading that turned "Dead Flowers" into a routine country lament hardly 
did those raging emotions justice. Some feelings just can't be expressed 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
When the delicate, wistful-looking Timmins sings, the words sound like thoughts 
drifting and flickering in a bone-weary mind that is barely resisting sleep. 
Sometimes, that sad and pretty internalized voice was just right: On meditative 
songs such as "Misguided Angel" and "30 Summers," Timmons sifted through deep 
wells of thought and emotion, evoking a profound sense of love strained and 
embattled. But at other times, as sameness of vocal tone set in, the listener's 
attention drifted. 
</P>
<P>
This would have been a widely uneven show if Timmins' talent was the crux of 
Cowboy Junkies. But the band's essence is really the wonderfully responsive and 
inventive instrumental work of the six men playing behind Timmons on a stage 
decorated by candles flickering in shallow glass holders. 
</P>
<P>
Restraint was the watchword instrumentally as well as vocally. But Cowboy 
Junkies' interactive ensemble playing led to shifts and shadings of tone and 
small surges in dynamics that introduced a fine, low-key energy into most of 
the songs. A few quietly smoldering blues songs early in the show were 
especially effective. 
</P>
<P>
But at any given point, whether the song was based in blues, folk or country 
music, something inventive and lovely was happening: a perfectly placed 
mandolin shimmer, fiddle weave or sharp but muted harmonica cry from 
multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird; a bit of pretty accordion embellishment from 
Jaro Czerwinec; a spare solo or gently twanging rhythm part from guitarist 
Michael Timmins, Margo's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Deschamps' pedal steel guitar work was a special pleasure. As a soloist, he 
summoned understated, mysterious dread during the Robert Johnson blues "Me and 
The Devil," and applied a strange, mad meander to Patsy Cline's "Walking After 
Midnight." Playing with the ensemble, Deschamps seemed to dab on just the right 
hues, for just the right durations, as he took the pedal steel guitar far 
beyond its standard honky-tonk sighs and keens. 
</P>
<P>
As a front woman, Margo Timmins was charismatic in her introverted way. 
Clinging to her microphone stand with both hands, she seemed deep in reverie. 
</P>
<P>
Timmins snapped out it enough between songs to display a wry sense of humor, 
but the wan tone in her speaking voice maintained a distance. 
</P>
<P>
By making an audience want to be drawn in, so that the distance can be bridged 
with concentrated listening, Cowboy Junkies achieved something unusual and 
fine. But if "Shhhhh" turns out to be more dogma than jest, something that 
sounded fresh the first time could easily turn into something pretentiously 
ascetic. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be a bad sign if, the next time around, Cowboy Junkies souvenir 
stands sport T-shirts that say, "Let It Rock."

Finally a stamp of approval for Elvis? Fans of the King can take heart that the 
battle for an Elvis Presley stamp may soon be over. Rep. Don Sundquist 
(R-Tenn.) recently criticized Postmaster General Anthony Frank after Frank made 
critical remarks about Presley's drug habit. Sundquist, who has been a 
proponent of an Elvis stamp, said that Frank then wrote him a letter, conceding 
that Presley rates a stamp on the merits of his music and popularity. Frank 
reiterated his concern about Presley's drug use but nonetheless told Sundquist: 
"My guess is that we will commence a series of stamps on popular American music 
and that Mr. Presley will be represented in this series." Presley's estate has 
exclusive rights to the use of his name and likeness but it has agreed to let 
the Postal Service use Presley's image without paying royalties. An estate 
spokeswoman has said that the Presley depicted on the stamp will be the slim 
Presley of the 1950s and 1960s, not the heftier Elvis of the 1970s. Claudia

Rock star Jon Bon Jovi's parents have started a scholarship named after their 
son to help aspiring artists attending his old high school. John and Carol 
Bongiovi said that the "Jon Bon Jovi Dare to Dream Scholarship" will be awarded 
to artistic students at Sayreville War Memorial High School. They would not 
disclose how much money was involved in the scholarship. The family will 
provide initial seed money for the scholarship fund, which will be supplemented 
by fund-raising events organized by students, said Jim Robinson, a school 
planning board chairman. Mrs. Bongiovi said potential scholarship recipients 
didn't necessarily have to be rock 'n' roll singers: "It could be a kid who 
likes to hammer the piano all day long and is driving everybody nuts." Claudia

Some clothes belatedly painted onto naked bodies in Michelangelo's "Last 
Judgment" in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel could come off during a restoration 
project, returning the work to what the artist originally intended. 
Michelangelo painted "The Last Judgment," conceived as a warning to the 
unfaithful, above the altar between 1535 and 1541, filling the huge fresco with 
writhing naked bodies. Veils were painted over the hips of about 30 figures on 
the orders of Pope Pius IV later in the 16th Century. These cannot be removed 
because the artist used the same fresco technique as Michelangelo. The garments 
scheduled to come off were painted onto the figures when the work was touched 
up in the 18th Century. Restoration to Michelangelo's frescoes in the chapel 
has been under way since 1980. It will take about four years to clean "The Last 
Judgment," the final phase of the project. Claudia Puig

Comedian Chevy Chase greeted the graduating class of the Shipley School in Bryn 
Mawr, Pa., with a "good morning, you little twerps," as he began his 
commencement speech Friday for 12th graders at the private, co-educational

A CAPABLE WATLEY SLICK, ENTERTAINING AT WILTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mostly through the avenue of music video, Jody Watley has already proven 
herself one of the most watchable women in pop -- thanks not only to her 
model-like physique, cheekbones that won't quit and those lips/those eyes, but 
also to real singing and, especially, dancing talents. 
</P>
<P>
In her local headlining debut Saturday at the Wiltern Theatre, Watley showed 
that it's not just camera angles and editing techniques propping up her 
popularity: She's been as blessedly created for the concert stage as she was 
made-for-MTV. 
</P>
<P>
Opening in a red halter and bell bottoms (to be replaced in later costume 
changes with more lacy things) and adorned in swinging crosses, Watley looked a 
little like a skinny Madonna at first. As a hoofer, Watley easily comes out on 
top of that competition; Madonna would kill to move with such relentless ease, 
for the way all of Watley's jerky, high-energy, go-go flair never betrays her 
innate grace. Two terrific female dancer/singers added immensely to the sharply 
and wittily choreographed fun. 
</P>
<P>
Like Donna Summer, Watley the singer is at her sexiest in the low range that 
she too rarely dips into (as in "Still a Thrill," her best single to date). 
There's a sameness to much of her pop-funk material, but her unassuming 
presence, if not necessarily her voice, redeems much of it. She's as sexy as 
they come, but never raunchy, and her winning smile and her penchant for 
offsetting those model-ish poses with daringly gangly moves make her a little 
less aloof, even as you dare not take your eyes from her charismatic visage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was a slight hollowness to the victory. For all the songs she 
sings about "commitment," Watley falls shy of making the biggest commitment of 
all to her audience: self-revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Superior as she is to most in her genre, Watley is beginning to seem a little 
less special as vivacious upstarts like Nenah Cherry and Gail Ann Dorsey appear 
on the scene. To paraphrase a line from Cherry's current hit, you end up 
asking, "What is she like, anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
That you leave Watley's slick, consistently entertaining show without feeling 
that you really know one way or another is a drag, and whether she can 
eventually transform the watchable into the personable may well determine her 
professional longevity. CHRIS WILLMAN

FANCY FOOTWORK FROM THE TOM TOM CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hi everybody! Welcome to the Tom Tom Club," said a beaming Chris Frantz as he 
took his spot behind the drum kit Saturday at the 2nd Coming club. 
</P>
<P>
From his buoyant, kiddie-show-host demeanor, you'd not guess the frustrations 
and fancy footwork that preceded the belated beginning of the Tom Tom Club's 
Los Angeles residency. After last Tuesday's opening at Variety Arts Center was 
canceled because of permit problems, the group scrambled around and finally 
opened Friday at the trendy mid-town dance club, a former Knights of Columbus 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Tom Tom Club, the funky side project of Frantz and his wife, bassist Tina 
Weymouth -- the rhythm section of Talking Heads -- bounced and rocked through a 
no-frills show Saturday that justified the "event" aura of this special 
extended run. 
</P>
<P>
What is light and airy on the three Tom Tom Club albums was downright massive 
on stage. Weymouth (a stronger and more confident singer live than on the 
records) and Frantz -- supported by guitarist Mark Roule, keyboardist Gary 
Pozner and effervescent singers Trish Ippolito and Victoria Clamp -- gave extra 
life to such already lively material as their old rap/funk hit "Genius of Love" 
and tunes from the new "Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom" album. They encored with 
"Under the Boardwalk" and a fun (yes, fun!) version of the Heads fave "Psycho 
Killer." 
</P>
<P>
The arty, post-Nina Hagen opening act Maria Excommunicada added to the "scene" 
feel, as did the inexpensive tickets -- just $12 -- and souvenir T-shirts -- a 
$6 bargain. The engagement continues Tuesday through Sunday.

PARKING-LOT SALE SHOOS WOLVES FROM THE STAGE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>

"I think we have survived!" 
</P>
<P>
With those words, a jubilant but weary Patricia Terry declared that Santa Ana's 
Alternative Repertory Theatre earned enough money at an emergency fund-raiser 
Saturday to keep it from closing because of a financial crisis. "This puts us 
back in the ballpark," said Terry, artistic director of the 2-year-old troupe. 
"I think we are going to have a third season." 
</P>
<P>
ART announced in May that poor attendance since February at its 61-seat 
storefront theater had led to the crisis, and that it would be forced to 
disband unless it raised $7,000 by the middle of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said the troupe netted more than $3,000 from Saturday's huge "Slaves to 
ART Parking Lot Sale," which drew a steady stream of customers for everything 
from used washing machines to home-baked goods and Tarot card readings. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings -- combined with a $1,000 pledge from a Newport Beach benefactor 
and recent income from improved box-office business -- have put ART close to 
its stated goal. "We'll have $6,000 in the bank by Monday morning," Terry 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe, which has come to symbolize the fitful growth of grass-roots arts 
groups in Orange County over the past two years, has produced seven plays since 
the fall of 1987. It's current offering -- William Hanley's "Slow Dance on the 
Killing Ground" -- is scheduled to close Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the latest turn of events, Terry said the troupe "will absolutely" 
seek nonprofit status to make fund-raising more practical. And it will pursue 
more sharply defined marketing plans on the advice of a professional 
fund-raiser who has "talked us through new strategies." 
</P>
<P>
One strategy already decided upon is another yard sale -- with donated items 
left over from the parking-lot sale -- to be held Saturday at 2312 Santa Ana 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ART has pencilled in a new season, though it hasn't yet decided on 
all the titles. A classical Greek play will lead off (Sept. 29-Nov. 18), 
possibly "Lysistrata" or "Medea." A contemporary piece will follow (Jan. 12- 
March 10), possibly "Joe Egg" or "Waiting for Godot." 
</P>
<P>
The third production will be the West Coast premiere of "Yalla Bitch" by Lorna 
C. Hill (April 6-May 26). Hill is the artistic director of the Ujma Theatre in 
Buffalo, N.Y., where she presented and starred in her play earlier this season. 
It is about a black woman's coming-of-age, Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Director's Fest '90" will close the season (June 5-July 2) and will be 
coordinated by Robert Leigh, a drama teacher at Rancho Santiago College in 
Santa Ana. The festival will be designed as an open forum for writers, 
directors and actors -- preferably from the county's ethnic communities -- who 
want to stage their work.

'DOCTOR, DOCTOR': CBS COMEDY ARRIVING IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Doctor, Doctor" begins a six-week run (at 10:30 tonight on Channels 2 and 8) 
deserving of a body bag. There's some improvement in next week's second 
installment of this new CBS comedy, upgrading its condition to critical. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of that second episode, Matt Frewer ("Max Headroom") has indeed 
endeared himself as refreshingly eccentric Mike Stratford, the lone maverick in 
a four-physician partnership whose other members find their profits at least as 
compelling as their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Frewer gives a nice spontaneity to this rumpled, spacey character who juggles 
his practice with his other careers as a novelist and medical expert on a local 
TV show. And there are times when the comedy writing by creator-executive 
producer Norman Steinberg has an appealingly off-center edge. 
</P>
<P>
Not enough times, however. 
</P>
<P>
The opening half hour, directed by Steinberg, is pathetically unfunny. As Mike 
first loses a patient, and then loses his girlfriend to Pittsburgh, you're 
losing your mind watching this idiocy unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Mike's devotion to old-fashioned "doctoring" is explored in a sometimes-amusing 
second episode, where the humor darkens considerably. Directed by John 
Whitsell, its best moments come in clashes between Mike and his 
high-tech-minded associates (Julius Carry III, Beau Gravitte and Maureen 
Mueller), one of whom believes that funerals are "fabulous places to network." 
Undermining that, however, are clumsily rendered sequences involving Mike's gay 
brother (Tony Carriero) and his narrow-minded father (Dakin Matthews). Ugh! 
</P>
<P>
Funerals are also fabulous occasions for burying some TV series. HOWARD

THE GERMAN EXPRESSIONIST VIEW OF MAN IN NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1800s, German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich expressed the 
overpowering feeling of nature by painting a tiny figure gazing out to sea. A 
century later, weary of the stultifying proprieties of bourgeois culture, the 
German Expressionists took a bolder, often fiercer tack. 
</P>
<P>
They exaggerated the contours and contrasts of the world around them to 
synchronize with their own intense sensibilities, recreating nature as a 
mysterious dream world or a monster organism driven by harsh rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
At the County Museum of Art (to Sept. 3), "German Expressionism and Nature," 
drawn from the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies, 
offers a sampling of 80 prints and drawings by major and lesser-known artists, 
grouped in categories such as "Nature as Paradise" and "Creation and 
Destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Although this arrangement makes the development of the movement as a whole 
harder to grasp -- as well as downplaying the artists' affiliations with groups 
like Die Brucke (The Bridge) and Der Blauer Reiter (The Blue Rider) -- it does 
allow the art itself to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
The movement's formal qualities were influenced by such diverse sources as 
medieval woodcuts, sculpture from the South Sea Islands, the graphic work of 
Norwegian artist Edvard Munch and the decorative qualities of Jugendstil, the 
German version of Art Nouveau. Its intellectual basis was rooted in such ideas 
as poet Rainer Maria Rilke's comment that art should be "almost hostile . . . 
to give our existence new meaning." And its emotional expression was as 
individual as the personalities of the artists themselves. 
</P>
<P>
If some of these images are charged with passion -- like Ernst Barlach's 
lithograph, "Star Dance," in which a gaunt, ecstatic figure hugs himself 
beneath a huge star-filled sky -- others simmer on a low flame. In Max 
Beckmann's drypoint, "Main River Landscape," scroll-like clouds and an unusual 
format emphasizing the white of the paper create a flat, diagrammatic effect 
almost like a medieval map. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most striking images in the exhibit are the work of artists whose 
names are no longer familiar. Alfred Hanf turned the natural world of "Country 
Road" into a nervous jangle of swelling and tapering lines that almost swallow 
up the moon and a baying dog. Gustav Wolf's lithograph, "The Fourth Day," 
conjures up the primal world of Creation, with multiple suns like cogs of 
machinery and exploding galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most fervent of these visions, however, is much smaller and paler than 
the kind of massively scaled, boldly outspoken art we are used to looking at 
today. A certain degree of patience helps smooth the transition between Now and 
Then, and so does a degree of empathy with an era more interested in the psyche 
than the body beautiful.

PIERCE DEBUT HONORS O.C. CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a reserved spirit of celebration for the Orange County Centennial, the 
Garden Grove Symphony under the baton of Edward Peterson ended its 1988-89 
season Saturday night at Wash Auditorium. A program of light music headed by 
the works of American composers unfortunately caught more people dozing off 
than appreciating the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Most anticipated was the premiere of Brent Pierce's "Landscapes, A Symphonic 
Tone Poem for Orchestra and Piano in Three Movements." Commissioned by the 
orchestra with donations from Times Mirror Co., Subaru and Disneyland, the new 
work raised few eyebrows, inspired few imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who directs jazz and choral ensembles at Cal State Fullerton, composes 
with a lush tonality that seems to reflect an interest in film music. In 
"Landscapes," he uses lots of notes, glissandos and sweeping passages, 
producing little variation in texture or dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while, more sophisticated harmonies and rhythms occur, sounding much 
like Aaron Copland. The third movement, "La Tierra Nueva," created a few 
surprises with a saxophone solo and what sounded like a quote from Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Most disappointing, the rudimentary piano part -- more suited as simply another 
orchestral part than a solo -- did little to display the talents of local 
pianist Pinio Dovalis-Miner. 
</P>
<P>
Dovalis-Miner's work in Falla's "Noches en los Jardines de Espana" proved more 
of a challenge. This time dressed in a bright blue dress and crossing herself 
before playing, she played with a sincere passion, aptly bringing out the 
Spanish idioms. Yet sometimes her high energy level became forced and, 
consequently, her playing inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson led the ensemble without much flair, locking into tempos that were 
consistently on the slow side. Aligning the varying tempos between orchestra 
and soloist also gave him some genuine problems. 
</P>
<P>
Closing the program was a routine performance of Copland's "El Salon Mexico."

MEA CULPA DEPT.: A reader whose knowledge of art is equalled by her gracious 
way of righting wrongs called to say that in Matisse's painting, "Dejeuner sur 
l'herbe," the nude is on the left, just as depicted in Mark Turnbull's musical, 
"Manet," at Laguna Playhouse. I had remembered it the other way around, and had 
the misfortune to check a reference book in which the photo was reversed, 
confirming my error. So "Manet" gets an A-plus for accuracy!

Canada today recalled its ambassador to China for consultations to protest the 
military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Ambassador Earl Drake will be brought 
back to Ottawa by the end of the week to discuss what the Canadian government 
can do to influence events in China. 
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is working with other countries to see how to 
"encourage the Chinese government to respect the whole democratic process that 
has been shown through the demonstrations by the students and other people in 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Clark told the House of Commons that the decision to withdraw the ambassador 
was made after consulting with Chinese community leaders in Canada, who have 
been demanding that the government break off ties with Beijing.

MAJOR QUAKE UNLIKELY, EXPERTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
TODAY'S MODEST TEMBLOR NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMED, JUST TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT AND 
A SCARY REMINDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The earthquake that struck this morning was a frightening reminder that 
Southern California lies at the heart of earthquake country, but experts doubt 
that the 4.5 temblor was a precursor to a great quake. 
</P>
<P>
The 9:57 shaker terrified many persons throughout the central city, but the 
quake was not nearly as bad as it seemed. It was just a modest quake that hit 
too close for comfort. It was proof once again that a small quake, if it's 
close enough, can rattle nerves even if it can't topple buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The main shock was followed less than half an hour later by a 4.3 aftershock, a 
surprisingly large aftershock after such a short period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's uncommon" for a 4.3 to follow a 4.5 that quickly, Caltech seismologist 
Kate Hutton said. But it's not all that rare, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton and U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Tom Heaton said today's temblor 
was not an aftershock to the Whittier Narrows quake of Oct. 1, 1987, which 
caused three deaths, but they said it occurred on the same fault system as the 
1987 quake. The Elysian Park Thrust System, as it is called, runs from Whittier 
to Elysian Park east of downtown Los Angeles and is considered capable of a 
major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
However, no one could see any reason why the 4.5 quake was a precursor to a 
major shaker. Hutton said she expected more aftershocks but she said there is 
only about a 1% to 2% chance that a larger quake is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
However, that small measure of reassurance must be tempered with the fact that 
there is considerable uncertainty among the experts over the nature and size of 
faults underlying the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Some quakes do not even break the surface of the ground, thus denying valuable 
research data to seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
Today's quake announced itself with a sharp, strong jolt over much of the 
central city, typical of a modest quake that is centered nearby. It shook tall 
buildings, despite its magnitude, because much of the downtown area is built on 
loose soils that allow an earthquake to make itself known over a wide area.

ANTELOPE VALLEY POT SUSPECT HELD

<P>
An Antelope Valley man was being held on suspicion of possession and 
cultivation of marijuana today after authorities found more than 10,000 
marijuana plants growing in the yard behind his home, the Los Angeles County 
sheriff's department reported. 
</P>
<P>
John McDonald, 50, was being held in lieu of $150,000 bail after the plants, 
weighing nearly 1,000 pounds, were seized Sunday at his home in the 20400 block 
of Avenue R in a rural area near Palmdale, Deputy Dan Cox said. Cox said 30 
pounds of dried and packaged marijuana also was found in a trailer on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The marijuana field was spotted by a sheriff's helicopter pilot on a routine 
patrol over the area. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies kept samples of the plants as evidence and burned the rest Sunday 
afternoon. They did not estimate the value of the illegal crop.

DESPONDENT AT LOSS OF JOB, RESEDA MAN KILLS SELF AT POLICE STATION

<P>
A Reseda man who was despondent over losing his job walked nearly a mile from 
his home to a Los Angeles police station where he fatally shot himself this 
morning on the building's front steps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Front desk officers at the West Valley Division in the 19000 block of Vanowen 
Avenue heard the shot and saw the man drop to the pavement outside the glass 
front doors about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The officers ducked to safety thinking someone was shooting at the station, but 
later determined the man, identified as Alan Matta, 21, had shot himself with a 
rifle. He was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center where he died about 
an hour later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was still under investigation but police said it appeared the man 
became despondent over losing a job and left the house he shared with his 
mother and stepfather.

TWIN QUAKES JOLT L.A.;

MINOR DAMAGE IN 4.5 AND 4.3 SHAKES; NO INJURY REPORTS;

<P>
DOWNTOWN HIGH-RISES WOBBLE

<P>
In less than a half-hour, two brief but intense earthquakes wrenched a vast 
area of Los Angeles this morning, causing slight damage, setting downtown 
high-rises swaying, showering ceiling tiles down onto a Board of Supervisors 
hearing and forcing evacuations, but otherwise causing no apparent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The quake and aftershock, 25 minutes apart, were also only a fraction apart in 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Tech seismologist Kate Hutton said the first shock, at 9:57 a.m., had a 
magnitude of 4.5 and lasted about five seconds. The second, at 10:22 a.m., 
registered at a magnitude of 4.3. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was fixed near Montebello, along the same Elysian Park fault as 
the October, 1987, Whittier quake, which killed three people and measured 5.9 
on the Richter scale. The Elysian Park fault extends from Montebello through 
East Los Angeles, skirting north of downtown to Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton said it is "uncommon, but not rare" for similar-sized quakes to occur 
that close together, and added that it presages "a continuing series of small 
aftershocks." Lucille Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey said a 1% to 2% 
chance remains that today's quakes are foreshocks of a larger quake in the next 
day or two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nerves Jangled 
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by today's temblor was minimal and the toll to residents was 
confined to the nervous systems of thousands of office workers and 
schoolchildren who evacuated shaking buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad enough the Lakers lost. Now we have to have this," groused Southern 
California Gas Co. official Ralph Cohen from his 11th-floor office in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the schoolyard at Breed Elementary School in East Los Angeles, several 
students fainted after the sizable aftershock, including a little girl from 
quake-plagued Central America. She was carried away on a stretcher, murmuring 
in Spanish, "Not again, not again." 
</P>
<P>
An elderly man and woman were trapped for an hour in a stalled elevator in the 
eight-story Beverly Tower, a senior citizens' residence in Montebello. Fire 
Capt. Orville Reed said the pair "are fine" and remained calm until help 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Early surveys by government agencies and public utilities found the area's 
systems -- highways, bridges, dams, electricity, gas, water and telephone -- 
were mostly undamaged, although dial tones were slow as thousands of unnerved 
residents grabbed for their phones when the shaking began. 
</P>
<P>
A big-rig truck on the San Bernardino Freeway tipped over in the jolting, 
according to Los Angeles County fire officials. The driver was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
At the 73-story downtown Library Tower, the tallest building in the West and 
still under construction, workers hustled out and watched from a parking lot as 
the tower swayed "noticeably" for several seconds after the quake stopped, said 
a bystander. 
</P>
<P>
In Montebello, near the epicenter, Gina Morales, 29, was at her desk at 
Cleveland Realty when the walls began creaking. "I ran over to my uncle (James 
Cleveland) and we grabbed each other and hung on."

The Supreme Court, in a major setback for affirmative action, today expanded 
the ability of white men to challenge court-approved plans giving preferential 
treatment to minorities and women in government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the justices handed civil rights advocates their latest defeat 
in the case of white Birmingham, Ala., firefighters who say they are victims of 
reverse discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said an affirmative action plan agreed to by public officials and 
approved in court may be attacked even years later in a new suit by workers who 
took no part in the case leading to the original agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling marks the third time this year a newly solidified high court 
conservative majority has dealt a significant blow to efforts aimed at helping 
minorities and women overcome bias. 
</P>
<P>
The court in January ruled that state and local governments generally may not 
impose racial quotas for public works projects. On June 5, the justices erected 
new barriers for minorities seeking to prove with statistics that they are 
relegated to lower paying, less desirable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, dismissed arguments 
that the ruling threatens voluntary settlement of minority employment 
discrimination claims. 
</P>
<P>
"A voluntary settlement in the form of a (court) consent decree between one 
group of employees and their employer cannot possibly settle, voluntarily or 
otherwise, the conflicting claims of another group of employees who do not join 
in the agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them, 
but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the ruling could have 
serious consequences for affirmative action plans agreed to by employers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision "would subject large employers who seek to comply with the law by 
remedying past discrimination to a never-ending stream of litigation and 
potential liability," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling threatens to undo efforts by Birmingham which "has made a 
substantial step toward the eradication of the long history of pervasive racial 
discrimination that has plagued its fire department." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun and 
Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin 
Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.

A twin-engine plane with 11 people aboard disappeared on what was to have been 
an hourlong tour of the Hawaiian Islands, and searchers used helicopters and 
boats to look for the plane, the U.S. Coast Guard said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris searched overnight through the channel 
separating the islands of Hawaii and Maui for the Scenic Air Tour Hawaii plane 
that vanished Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard was concentrating its search for the plane off the northeast 
coast of the island of Hawaii, the last confirmed location of the twin-engine 
Beechcraft. 
</P>
<P>
The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA ground station 
that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui's Kahului Airport, the FAA's George

Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an advocate of better access for U.S. goods in other 
countries, said today the number of imported cars sold here threatens the 
existence of the domestic auto industry and its suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio Democrat said it is essential for the industry's survival that U.S. 
auto suppliers receive more business with foreign car manufacturers because 
Japan already controls one-third of the domestic new car market. 
</P>
<P>
Kaptur admitted the United States is in a weak position to demand better 
access, however, because of Japan's support and involvement in the U.S. 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
She also acknowledged that those circumstances made it difficult to use trade 
sanctions against Japan to force open those markets. 
</P>
<P>
"I am someone who believes that access to our marketplace should be used as a 
tool in order to get access to other people's marketplace," Kaptur said. "There 
should be reciprocity certainly between the United States and Japan."

JUSTICES WILL REVIEW $1.3-MILLION VERDICT ON PRICING BY TEXACO 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court agreed today to review a $1.3-million verdict against Texaco 
for price discrimination in a case that could force big changes in product 
distribution practices of businesses everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The justices will hear arguments next term in Texaco's appeal of a U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the jury verdict against the oil 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether manufacturers such as Texaco can sell their product to 
wholesalers at a lower price than to retailers if such pricing results in less 
retail competition. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury in Washington state found Texaco guilty of price discrimination 
for selling gasoline to 11 Spokane retailers at higher prices than to two 
independent wholesalers, who in turn sold the gas to other retailers who 
competed with the Texaco stations. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law known as the Robinson-Patman Act generally prohibits the sale of 
like goods to different purchasers at a different price but allows 
manufacturers to offer discounts to wholesalers to compensate them for the 
distributional services they perform. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the jury concluded that the wholesale discount was illegal 
because it did not merely reflect the wholesaler's distribution costs but was 
passed on to other retailers whose customers were the same as the Texaco 
retailers'. 
</P>
<P>
The case began when Ricky Hasbrouck, owner of Rick's Texaco, filed suit along 
with 10 other station owners accusing Texaco of price discrimination. The suit 
alleged that from 1972 until 1981 Texaco sold gas at lower prices to John 
Dompier Oil Co. and Gull Oil Co., both of which supplied and operated a chain 
of retail stations in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
During a three-week trial, the Texaco station owners presented testimony that 
they had lost sales and profits as a result of the competition from Dompier and 
Gull. A jury agreed and awarded them $449,900, which was automatically tripled 
by law. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was affirmed by the appeals court in March. 
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the nation's highest court, Texaco argued that the verdict "puts 
in question the normal pricing practices of countless businesses across the 
country and jeopardizes the continued role of wholesalers in the American 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
"In calling for suppliers to sell at different prices within the wholesale 
level of trade based upon each wholesaler's costs, the decision departs from 
established precedent, from practicality and from congressional intent," Texaco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Texaco dealers opposed the appeal, arguing that Dompier and 
Gull Oil were not wholesalers but retailers in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Manufacturers sided with Texaco in the case, telling the 
court that the lower court ruling would "deter if not make impossible the use 
of independent local businesses as distributors."

<P>
British consumers, taking advantage of an unusually warm May, went on a 
shopping spree that added to inflationary pressures and raised concerns that 
further rises in interest rates may be needed to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported today that seasonally adjusted retail sales jumped by 
2.5% in May -- three times the rise economists had predicted -- after a 1.4% 
decline in April. 
</P>
<P>
"This is much stronger than expected and will increase the upward pressure on 
U.K. interest rates," said an economist with Midland Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks eased in London and money market interest rates climbed as investors 
were disappointed that the government's strategy of using high interest rates 
to brake inflation has not yet succeeded.

An accident during a race at Lancaster National Speedway claimed the life of

driven by Bill Carey of Sloan. Both cars spun backward and slammed into a 
retaining wall.
