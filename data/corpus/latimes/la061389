President Bush took his 65th birthday in stride by going on a 
"longer-than-customary" run. "I wanted to show that 65 can still do three 
miles," Bush said during his run at Ft. McNair, an Army post overlooking the 
Potomac River in Washington. Wearing blue shorts with the insignia MSU and a 
white T-shirt, he jogged with Secret Service agents and Joseph Bagnerise Jr., 
the son of Col. Joseph Bagnerise, the post commander. Later, the Marine Band 
played "Happy Birthday" and Budget Director Richard G. Darman -- dressed in a 
gorilla outfit -- pranced on the White House lawn as Bush departed by 
helicopter for Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on the first leg of a trip to the 
West. The gorilla wore a red sash that read "kinder, gentler" and carried 
gas-filled balloons marked "education," "S&amp;L" and "clean air."

 -- Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, has been offered an honorary knighthood 
-- the highest royal honor Britain bestows on Americans, Burke's Peerage said. 
The former President, who is in London on his first visit since leaving the 
White House in January, will be the guest of Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham 
Palace lunch Wednesday, but nobody would say whether she would give him an 
award then. Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of Burke's Peerage, which chronicles 
British aristocracy, said "we understand" the knighthood has been offered "and 
will be accepted either this trip or his next trip, which is expected to be 
next spring." Brooks-Baker said Reagan was offered a knighthood "because of his 
special contribution to the British government under (Prime Minister Margaret) 
Thatcher."

 -- A memorial to women in the military moved a step closer to reality when 
design teams based in Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and Georgia were selected 
as finalists in competition to build the monument at the entrance to Arlington 
National Cemetery. Retired Army Brig. Gen. Wilma L. Vaught, president of the 
Women in Military Service for America Foundation, said three of the four would 
each receive a $10,000 prize. The jury recommended that the fourth team's entry 
be considered as an alternate, in case one of the top three dropped out. But 
Vaught said the foundation decided to make it a finalist because it was the 
only design that included a cultural-educational center. The winner is to be 
chosen in November. The memorial, authorized by Congress, is to be built with 
private funds on a four-acre site at the ceremonial gate to the cemetery.

Iran's Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose political position has 
strengthened since the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death, was reelected to 
another one-year term, the official news agency IRNA said. It reported that 230 
out of 241 deputies at special session of the Iranian Parliament voted to 
retain the Speaker. Rafsanjani, 55, who is also the armed forces commander in 
chief, is the only declared candidate in the Aug. 18 presidential election.

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, served 
notice in a letter to colleagues that he will oppose addition of special tax 
breaks for selected individuals or businesses to any legislation written by the 
panel this year. It has been almost routine for years for members of the 
Finance and House Ways and Means committees to attach amendments benefiting one 
or two individuals or businesses to general tax bills. The beneficiaries were 
seldom named in the bills. The practice was all but abandoned in 1988, 
apparently because of the public outcry that followed inclusion of special 
breaks in the 1986 tax overhaul.

A judge in Atlanta dismissed one of 10 perjury counts against former Rep. Pat 
Swindall as the defense began its case. U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman 
called the count "just too confusing for a jury trial." The judge also threw 
out more than half an hour of testimony by a defense witness, Rep. Barney Frank 
(D-Mass.) who discussed what knowledge that congressmen do and do not have on 
details of legislation. Swindall is accused of lying to a federal grand jury 
that was investigating the laundering of illegal drug profits. The former 
Republican lawmaker negotiated an $850,000 home loan with a businessman who has 
since been convicted on money laundering charges. The dismissed charge said 
Swindall lied when he testified that he knew little about a mortgage company 
created to funnel the money to Swindall.

ARMS TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The role of the United States as a peacemaker in the world brings into question 
the flourishing international arms trade, with the United States as the major 
supplier of armaments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the global trade in major weapons reached $36 billion, of which $24.7 
billion went to Third World nations. The United States is also the major 
supplier of the technology that other countries want in order to produce their 
own nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The military industries thrive 
while the weapons we sell or give outright to countries with whom we share 
security interests encourage invasions, civil wars and the migration of 14 
million refugees roaming the world, driven from their homes by war. 
</P>
<P>
Before World War II the hidden arms trade and black markets were the domain of 
munitions makers. As contracts have grown into billions of dollars, the sale of 
weapons has become government policy. 
</P>
<P>
What is the response of Congress to all of this? What do the American people 
want? Do they want to live permanently in a war economy?

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY QUANDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years ago, a New York utilities analyst estimated that only about 
one-fourth of America's nuclear power plants were run by companies that 
understood the unique challenges of nuclear energy. Rancho Seco, near 
Sacramento, was not among the 25%, so voters shut it down last week. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, which produced less than half of the power it was designed to do -- 
when it ran at all -- was, like some lemon from an automobile assembly line, 
constantly laid up for repairs. It might have worked properly some day, but the 
people who relied for power on the Sacramento Municipal Utility District could 
not count on that. Closing it down probably was a prudent decision, even if it 
will now cost as much as $300 million to seal off all of its radioactive parts. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Seco was the first nuclear plant in the nation to be ordered closed by 
voters, but that is a less important part of history than whether the nuclear 
power industry learned anything from Rancho Seco during the 15 years that it 
operated, off and on. The answer seems to be no. 
</P>
<P>
One clue is that the industry is not clamoring for changes in the system that 
would give new power plants a better chance for a full life than Rancho Seco 
had. 
</P>
<P>
The changes that are needed include standardizing plant design, making tough 
calls about whether a utility company can be trusted with nuclear power and 
following rigid nuclear rules without the kinds of politically based exceptions 
that too often are made on matters such as emergency evacuation plans. 
</P>
<P>
Peoples of the world cannot go on burning fossil fuels to produce energy 
without accelerating a warming of the Earth's atmosphere that already has 
reached a point from which it cannot be reversed for decades or perhaps 
centuries. In the heady days of discovery right after World War II, it seemed 
that nuclear power might provide unlimited amounts of electricity at costs, as 
they said then were "too cheap to meter." Nobody understood the potential 
greenhouse effect then. If they had, they might have worked harder at making 
nuclear power work right. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that so many of America's 110 nuclear power plants give their owners 
so much trouble is that no two of them are alike. Each is tailor-made for the 
company that pays for it. Because there is no standard model, trouble at one 
plant does not necessarily translate into lessons to be learned about 
operations at another. No other nuclear nation that we know of operates that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power advocates are promoting a fresh start, a new round of 
construction of nuclear power plants. Before that happens, Congress must insist 
on knowing whether the last generation of plants needs improving and why there 
is so little standardization among nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
It also must face the possibility that the United States may never be able to 
match the smooth operating record of nuclear power plants in some other 
countries. That would mean putting a similar amount of time and money into 
research on other energy producers such as photovoltaic solar cells or fuel 
cells that create energy from hydrocarbons without burning them as fallback 
resources to help reduce the greenhouse effect.

Just an observation on Archbishop Mahony's policy statement on abortion. As a 
lawyer of some 55 years of active practice, I wish to congratulate him on his 
excellent argument against abortion and its application to Catholic and public 
officials. No attorney could have better presented the facts. It surely gives 
thought to all of them, whether elected or appointed. The easiest position for 
any of them to take is to straddle the fence by arguing that I am not 
pro-abortion, but I will leave it to my constituents for their individual 
freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
It is great to be elected to office, but after obtaining the positions, none of 
them can cast aside the fact that abortion is murder and human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, abortion will, undoubtedly, be with us, but it should not be 
legalized and funded with taxpayers' dollars. I am tired of hearing about 
everyone's rights, but seldom a word of their obligations.

We want to commend The Times' editorial "Zeal and Politics" (June 6) for its 
response to Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's recent declaration that all Catholic 
officeholders in government "have a positive moral obligation" to work for the 
repeal of laws permitting abortion." 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church has every right to express itself on public issues, 
including abortion. As does every citizen, religious group, and voluntary 
association, it has the right to urge a change in the constitutional law of 
abortion, and to call for a re-examination of those public policies which allow 
reproductive choice. In a democracy necessarily committed to freedom of 
expression, no other rule is conceivable. But Archbishop Mahony's recent 
statement that government officials who are Catholics "have a positive moral 
obligation" to work for the repeal of laws permitting abortion stands on a 
different footing. 
</P>
<P>
The Archbishop has a legal right to say what he did. In a pluralistic society, 
however, calls for public officials to act as believers are improper. Public 
officials owe all citizens -- and not just those who share their religious 
views -- a duty to exercise their own best judgment, even though colored by 
religious beliefs -- not blind obedience to ecclesiastical authority, whether 
it be a bishop, a pastor or a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
If the Catholic Church, or any church, can persuade a public official, of 
whatever religious persuasion, that its position on abortion is more consistent 
with the vision of a just society, that official is free to act on that view to 
the extent the law allows. What no church or synagogue should do is demand that 
its adherents holding public office respond in lock step to its religious 
teachings. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in this century, Catholics running for the presidency have faced strong 
opposition from bigots who argues that no Catholic could be trusted with public 
office because they would inevitably take orders from the Vatican. Once that 
opposition defeated an able Catholic candidate, Al Smith; the other time, the 
candidate, John F. Kennedy, overcame that opposition by stating that, in his 
capacity as a public official, he was not subject to the authority of any 
church official. Notwithstanding the sympathy one must feel for those 
confronted with a clash between their most deeply held beliefs and their duty 
to the public to exercise their independent judgment, the balance must be 
struck in favor of the public interest.

MORAL MAJORITY -- AN EPITAPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAL THOMAS, Cal Thomas writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization that once struck fear into the hearts of liberals and inspired 
bumper stickers ("The Moral Majority Is Neither") has been laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
The Moral Majority came in like a lion and went out like a lamb. The Rev. Jerry 
Falwell, who proclaimed the creation of the organization on a mountaintop in 
Lynchburg, Va., in 1979, announced its demise in Las Vegas, a city that some 
believe represents every sin he tried to fight. 
</P>
<P>
The Moral Majority, where I was a vice president between 1980 and '85, never 
lived up to its supporters' highest expectations or its detractors' worst 
fears. It did not achieve its agenda, which included a reversal of abortion on 
demand, voluntary school prayer, a reduction of drug use and restrictions on 
pornography. Though government officials consulted it on nominees for high 
office, the Moral Majority's opinion was not decisive. 
</P>
<P>
What it did was transform the political landscape by re-enfranchising a large 
bloc of people who had withdrawn from politics because they had been taught, 
often by ministers like Falwell, that politics was dirty and secondary to 
Christianity's primary goal of equipping people for heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Articulate and bright, Jerry Falwell spoke for millions of Americans who felt 
leaderless. Without him, the Moral Majority would never have left the launching 
pad. Other conservative leaders, including Paul Weyerich and Howard Phillips, 
were instrumental in its creation, but Falwell provided the charismatic match 
that ignited the political firestorm. He took on the left's biggest stars on 
their own turf, from the Donahue show to Harvard, where he was booed as a Nazi 
by people who claimed to be tolerant and pluralistic. 
</P>
<P>
Even liberals, who denounced his brand of conservatism, came to like Falwell as 
a person. His sense of humor and genuine acts of kindness diffused much of the 
electricity that often surrounded his political views. 
</P>
<P>
I once took Falwell on a tour of inner-city Washington, and we ended up at a 
black church, where he listened to poor people talk about their problems. A 
young black boy wanted to ride with Falwell to the airport after the meeting 
and Falwell asked him if he planned to finish school. The boy said he did. 
Falwell got a piece of paper and wrote down his unlisted home number. "When you 
graduate from high school, call me and you will have a full scholarship to 
Liberty University," he said. (Falwell's school in Lynchburg). 
</P>
<P>
Falwell could be exasperating, including those times when he made outrageous 
claims in fund-raising letters, but his genuine love of people covered a 
multitude of sins and few left his presence with bitter feelings. 
</P>
<P>
If one measures political success in terms of a viable machine that can elect 
or defeat whom it wishes, then the Moral Majority was clearly not a successful 
movement. But if the yardstick is setting the agenda for political debate by 
both parties on the significance of traditional values, a strong national 
defense, pro-life and other conservative issues, then its influence will be 
felt for a long time.

SOVIET CONGRESS SEES A FINE ECONOMIC MESS, BUT THERE AGREEMENT ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONID KORENEV, Leonid Korenev is a senior writer on economics for the 
Soviet press agencyNovosti. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discussion of economic matters at the Congress of People's Deputies 
proceeds amid disquieting signs: In some regions of the country, tea and 
detergents are being rationed, and people are sporadically hoarding certain 
goods that have never been in short supply before. On the whole, the 
consumer-market situation shows more and more signs of disequilibrium. 
According to expert estimates, only 20% of each ruble in circulation is 
actually backed with goods -- and the excess of money over goods keeps growing. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the discussion of economic affairs at the Congress mirrors the 
current situation, the more so since, due to live television coverage, 
virtually the entire population is taking part in the debate. This is vividly 
confirmed by opinion polls. For instance, we hear demands that the Congress 
discuss the so-called Popov Report on measures to accelerate economic reform, 
put forward by a group of Moscow deputies. In much the same manner, all 
proposals made at the Congress evoke instantaneous response. This is 
particularly true of suggestions containing radical and extraordinary elements, 
although they often propose diametrically opposite things. 
</P>
<P>
However, all are unanimous in the opinion that, so far, the economic reform has 
not produced any tangible results, and that the current critical situation 
should not be allowed to last long. 
</P>
<P>
Objectively speaking, two polar approaches prompt themselves: Either we 
recognize that the reform is a flop and move backward to the administrative 
system or admit that the reform was only partial and make a dramatic step 
forward in effecting it. We know that in principle the second option has been 
chosen. At the current Congress, there are no people who want perestroika 
processes to be curbed, at least no one has said so. In this respect the 
debates at the Congress mirror rather accurately the prevailing sentiments in 
society, a majority of which stands for change. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of critical statements and remarks, and nothing is 
off-limits for deputies. The problem is to make the proposed program 
constructive and realistic. There is broad agreement that "holes" in the budget 
should be patched, notably through cutting military expenditures, freezing 
large numbers of unfinished construction projects in industry (their value is 
150 billion rubles, which is more than enough to offset the budget deficit) and 
slashing administrative costs. Finally, it is important that we find a way to 
end enormous losses in the agrarian sector (grain losses alone are equal to our 
grain imports, for which we have to pay in hard currency). Conflicting 
viewpoints are expressed only on the funding of space projects. 
</P>
<P>
It is also very well understood where additional funds should be channeled: 
pensions, education and public health and, finally, importation of consumer 
goods that are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult question is how all this should be done. We have been 
speaking about unprofitable and wasteful projects "of the century" for quite 
some time. Some of them already have been frozen. Yet suddenly, in the years of 
perestroika, there has emerged another "great" plan, a plan to build a gas 
processing complex in western Siberia (according to preliminary estimates, it 
will cost 41 billion rubles, although some say the costs may go up to 100 
billion). In other words, the old economic system is still here. 
</P>
<P>
However, views of the deputies differ precisely on this point: They offer 
various recipes for curbing the "command-and-administer" system of economic 
management. Speaking in simple terms, one can discern two tendencies. One is 
toward putting market mechanisms in operation without delay and making them 
work, the other is toward using the same old command measures to get out of the 
crisis ("desperate diseases must have desperate remedies"). Although the latter 
proved its inefficiency, say, during Khrushchev's "thaw," there are still 
illusions on this score reflecting a nostalgic feeling for a "hand of iron." It 
should be said that such illusions persist in certain strata of society and 
make themselves felt in some remarks at the Congress. In this sense the mirror 
of the economic debate is doing its job fairly well. 
</P>
<P>
Well, thank God, we're witnessing the pluralism of opinion. Outward, deceptive 
unanimity is much worse, as we know from the recent history of our country. 
</P>
<P>
However, for all its accuracy in reflecting images, the mirror has one 
deceptive trait: It turns the image from right to left, making it difficult, 
say, to read texts. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a custom in Soviet public life for a rather long time to describe 
as "leftists" those who were undoubtedly considered "rightists" several decades 
ago -- advocates of commodity-money relations, a traditional parliamentary 
system and so forth. Whereas "rightists," in modern parlance, are those who 
favor an authoritarian economy, pay leveling and so on. But then, with a 
certain amount of experience one can make out who's who. The difficult thing is 
to read the text the right way. 
</P>
<P>
Odd as it may seem, it is deputies representing trade unions (fortunately not 
all trade union deputies) who advocate all kinds of wage "ceilings," oppose the 
right of workers to choose jobs where pay is higher (more often than not the 
cases in point are in the new cooperatives) and favor the preservation of 
various control mechanisms in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one should not be surprised: For too long a time the official trade 
union movement was a driving belt of the state and perestroika proceeds with 
difficulty in it. Besides, deputies from trade unions were chosen in a 
multistage procedure, not by direct voting of rank-and-file members. But let us 
hope that time will finally sort things out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the heated debates at the Congress focus on ways of preventing the 
economic ship from hitting the rocks. But the distance to the rocks is 
perilously short.

ORIOLE GM HEMOND PLEASED WITH TRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the last 2 1/2 months, Roland Hemond, general manager of the Orioles, 
somehow has refrained from making any trades. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got a call I have to return," he said in jest. "And I've got something 
written down on a scrap of paper. Maybe one of those will bring a trade." 
</P>
<P>
The man who has a reputation in baseball as a wheeler-dealer has gone silent in 
the marketplace. Now it is his team that is making all the noise. 
</P>
<P>
But Hemond is ever vigilant after a whirlwind first 19 months with the Orioles, 
when he averaged a deal a month. 
</P>
<P>
"You still pay attention," he said. "You look ahead at your possible needs. 
But, at this moment, that hasn't been pressing." 
</P>
<P>
In great measure, the heat is off because of the success of Hemond's trades 
since last summer, when the Orioles finally made a full-blown commitment to 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
Six players who contributed strongly to the Orioles' first-place drive, Brady 
Anderson, Randy Milligan, Brian Holton, Phil Bradley, Bob Melvin and Mike 
Devereaux, came in transactions engineered by Hemond after the team decided to 
sweep out the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
Two others, Francisco Melendez and Chris Hoiles, have had the proverbial cup of 
coffee with the major-league team and could return. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the average age of the Big Six is 27.5 years, almost seven years 
younger than the average of the six who left in deals during the same time span 
-- Mike Boddicker, Mike Morgan, Eddie Murray, Terry Kennedy, Jim Dwyer and Fred 
Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Another player, pitcher Ken Howell, is not included because he was an Oriole 
for four days, then, presto, he wasn't one because Hemond had struck again, 
trading him and Gordon Dillard to the Philadelphia Phillies for Phil Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with the way things have turned out," Hemond said. "We got 
young players with talent, and they will get better. The plan was that they 
would grow with us, that we will get many more years of production from them. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think anyone could have expected these kinds of results this 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
Judging the outcome of trades is an inexact art at best. Generally, several 
years are required before a gauge even can be applied accurately and unforeseen 
events like career-ending injuries can intervene. 
</P>
<P>
But down the line, after Boddicker and Lynn and Kennedy and Murray have ceased 
to be productive, the Orioles' acquisitions may be going strong. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hemond is not of the school that believes in hornswoggling the other 
team. Ideally, he said he likes his trading partner to receive benefits as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"All you try to achieve is to have a better club after it's all over," he said. 
"You can't be concerned that each and every trade is to your advantage. If you 
can give the other club players they can utilize effectively, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Hemond said he believes in "value for value, needs for needs" and that "you 
have to consistently cross the same bridges and deal with the same people. You 
can't purposely burn them. If somebody gets delight out of getting much the 
better of a trade, that's just their character. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see Morgan and Howell doing well. And Boston wouldn't have won 
the division without Boddicker last season." 
</P>
<P>
At first, his appointment to succeed Hank Peters met with both skepticism and 
criticism. After 1987, the Orioles were wallowing in stagnation and Hemond 
appeared to be plugging gaping holes with Band-Aids. 
</P>
<P>
The deals he made entering last season he described as "not major transactions. 
They were stopgap. We were doing something, trying, but it wasn't until later 
that we figured a definite direction for the club." 
</P>
<P>
Only two players, Mark Thurmond and Jay Tibbs, are with the Orioles from that 
first off-season under Hemond. A third, Keith Hughes, is playing for the Class 
AAA Rochester Red Wings. Of the players the Orioles traded in six deals, only 
Mike Young (Cleveland Indians) is in the majors elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
It was a feeling-out period, much like the early rounds of a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a new organization with people who hadn't worked with each other," 
Hemond said. "We only had three weeks before the winter meetings, and a lot of 
what we were doing was just acclimation. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it important to do something, but we had to be careful about major 
deals. First, we had to learn how people (in the organization) expressed 
themselves and what they meant, how explicit they were, in evaluating certain 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Hemond had not been involved in the operation of a club for two seasons, and 
"what I remembered about players from '85 did not necessarily apply going into 
'88. Some of our people had to save me (in some judgments). 
</P>
<P>
"But that situation leads to the status quo. It's better not to make a move 
than make radical ones you might regret. When you're not on the inside with a 
club, you're seeing it with a different set of eyes. You have to stop on top of 
players' progress month to month, week to week." 
</P>
<P>
So the Orioles were on a treadmill for a season. But after the release of Scott 
McGregor May 2 last year and then Fantastic Fans Night later the same day, the 
commitment to youth was on. 
</P>
<P>
Given license by ownership to start the wheels, Hemond began to resemble Pa 
Bell, a telephone constantly at his side. As in his days with the Chicago White 
Sox with Bill Veeck, he was "Open for Business," a sign those two posted in the 
lobby of the headquarters hotel during the winter meetings one year. 
</P>
<P>
Hemond first concentrated on dealing with pennant contenders who were more 
likely to seek veterans who could help them during the stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Anderson-Boddicker swap started an irreversible trend that accelerated with 
the moving of Lynn and hit a peak with the deal of Murray. 
</P>
<P>
There was no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
The Murray deal actually was three-sided, with Howell going to Philadelphia in 
the trade for Bradley four days after he became an Oriole, and two months 
later, Devereaux coming to Baltimore for Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers might not have been in need of that type of pitching (Morgan) if 
they hadn't traded Brian Holton and Howell," said Hemond. "That was still part 
of the Murray trade." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere inside Hemond, a little voice is exhorting him to talk turkey with 
his fellow GMs. He just can't help himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've made a lot of trades by nature," he said. "It's exciting. You 
remember when you were a fan in Rhode Island waiting for the paper just to see 
the speculation about the Braves and Red Sox. In baseball, there is more 
attention to trades than any other sport. It's part of the lure of our game." 
</P>
<P>
At Hemond's first winter meeting as the GM of the White Sox, 16 players changed 
teams in 18 hours. It's in his blood.

DODGERS FOLLOW GIBSON'S NEW LEAD, 9-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was putting Kirk Gibson in the leadoff role an inspired move? Only time will 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
For the present, however, the Dodgers can't help but be inspired by it. 
</P>
<P>
In joining with Willie Randolph to form a team within a team at the top of the 
lineup, Gibson provided a catalytic punch Monday night as the Dodgers made it 
two in a row over the Cincinnati Reds and salvaged a split of the four-game 
series, 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
A Dodger Stadium crowd of 28,161 saw Gibson single to open a two-run first 
inning, triple to open a one-run third and single with one out in the fifth to 
put the fourth run in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
He also walked in the seventh, when Randolph delivered his second double of the 
game, driving in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson went from first to third on the first of those doubles and from first to 
home on the second, running out from under his helmet and waving his right arm 
as he crossed the plate -- a scene reminiscent of last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who had scored only three runs in the last 30 innings and 
collected only 14 singles in the first three games of the series, got a triple, 
three doubles, eight singles and a two-run homer by Dave Anderson in a 
continued awakening that will put Manager Tom Lasorda back in the third-base 
coaching box for the third consecutive game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
And if the remodeled lineup has truly revitalized the offense, the test will 
come tonight when Mike Scott, 10-3 overall and 3-0 against the Dodgers this 
season, pitches the opener of a three-game series for the sizzling Houston 
Astros, who have won 10 consecutive road games and are coming off a 10-1 home 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan, who had lost three of his last four decisions, was the beneficiary 
of the rare onslaught Monday night, but Ricky Horton and John Wetteland 
provided flawless relief as the Dodgers inched to within 6 1/2 games of the 
idle Astros, who lead the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds trailed only 4-1 and had the bases loaded with no outs when Horton 
relieved Morgan in the seventh, got Jeff Reed to ground into a run-scoring 
force play, popped up Luis Quinones and then yielded to right-hander Wetteland, 
who struck out Joel Youngblood and went on to retire the next six Reds, 
striking out three as he registered his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who allowed a first inning homer by Todd Benzinger, gave up only two 
more hits before the Reds loaded the bases in the seventh on three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's league-leading earned-run average climbed from 1.47 to 1.59 and his 
record went to 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson led off for the first time in Sunday's game. He went 0 for 3, but walked 
and scored the first run of a 3-1 victory after Randolph's hit-and-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after only two appearances as leadoff hitter, Gibson has scored four runs, 
providing a fresh approach for his team and himself. He was one for 17 before 
Monday night's three hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
"Gibson plays one way and that's to win," Red Manager Pete Rose said, adding, 
however, that he has some doubt that the Dodgers can win with Gibson in the 
leadoff role. 
</P>
<P>
"It really seems to have helped him batting leadoff," Rose said, "but he's not 
a leadoff hitter. He got things going for them tonight, but he'll have to hit 
some home runs for them to win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda: "I hate to have him bat leadoff as well, he really should be in 
the No. 3 position, but we needed a spark. What more can you ask for from the 
numbers one and two hitters? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we scored nine runs. Did it matter that Gibby didn't hit a homer?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, who's to say Gibson won't homer as the leadoff hitter. Gibson 
wouldn't say it. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach is the same if I'm hitting first or third," he said. "I'm trying 
to get on, be aggressive, make things happen. We're looking for the right 
chemistry and I'm not a stingy player." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph, meanwhile, has raised his season's average to .291 by batting .342 
over his last 36 games. He is also batting .433 when in the No. 2 spot, and 
said that in the last two games he is "definitely seeing better pitches" with 
Gibson on base and a threat to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think he's an ideal No. 3 hitter, but we needed him up there, we 
needed to get something going," Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got it going against Rick Mahler (8-6). Alfredo Griffin had two 
singles and scored twice. Mike Davis had a 395-foot sacrifice fly and single. 
Anderson scored one run with a squeeze bunt single and then powered his first 
home run since Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers lifted their .226 batting average two points and their spirits 
considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers brought infielder Mariano Duncan off the disabled list and put 
outfielder Chris Gwynn on the 15-day disabled list with a stress fracture in 
his right foot . . . Gwynn believes that he suffered the injury during the 
recent series in Houston but isn't sure how. An X-ray taken in Atlanta was 
negative, but continuing discomfort led to a bone scan Monday and disclosure of 
the fracture.

MORNING BRIEFING: THESE ARE FIGHTING WORDS, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's Morning Briefing is devoted to excerpts from "505 Boxing Questions Your 
Friends Can't Answer," written by Berg Sugar and John Grasso and published by 
Walker and Company. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Jackson,the black Australian whom John L. Sullivan refused to fight, was 
considered to be 'sharkproof.' Jackson was a native of St. Croix in the (Virgin 
Islands) and when he was 12 years old and swimming in the sea, a shark surfaced 
near him and turned upon its side to attack. A yard or so from Peter the fish 
stopped and then streaked for the open sea. The only explanation for this was 
that he was 'sharkproof.' Only one other man among the 5,000 inhabitants of the 
island possessed that gift. The two would often swim together without fear in 
the shark-infested waters." 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Hogan,born Benediel Hagen in Wurttemberg, Germany, was an American 
heavyweight title claimant in 1872. He was both a Union and a Confederate spy 
during the Civil War as well as an oil magnate, theatrical producer and 
gambling house operator during his lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
"Gene Tunney received a check for $1,000,000 for his share as champion in his 
second bout with Jack Dempsey. The bout drew 104,943 spectators at Soldier 
Field in Chicago with gross receipts of $2,658,660. 
</P>
<P>
"Tunney was not entitled to $1,000,000 as his share of the bout. His share 
amounted to only $990,445, but he wanted to receive a check for a million 
dollars and wrote his own check to Tex Rickard, the promoter, for the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What champion fighter scored victories over a father and his son 
14 years apart? "Henry Armstrong defended his welterweight championship five 
times within one month in October, 1939, including two defenses within five 
days on two occasions. He fought in five different cities and had bouts on Oct. 
9, 13, 20, 24 and 30." 
</P>
<P>
"Willie Pep, featherweight champion from 1942 to 1950, and Lauro Salas, 
lightweight champion for five months in 1952, were the only champions whose 
last names read the same backward and forward. (Pep qualifies with an asterisk, 
as his given name is Guglielmo Papaleo.)" 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Louis was able to trace his family tree back to his great-great 
grandfather, who was a full-blooded Indian chief named Charles Hunkerfoot." 
</P>
<P>
"Big Ben Moroz,7 feet 1 inch, 302 pounds, and Gilbert Stromquist, 7 feet, 253 
pounds, met three times in 1943 and 1944, with Moroz winning all three by 
knockout. Moroz compiled a record of 20-16-1 and Stromquist 5-14." 
</P>
<P>
"Vittorio Campolo knocked down Miguel (the Human Yo-Yo) Ferrara 36 times in 
five rounds (on Sept. 7, 1925, at Buenos Aires) for an average of more than 
seven knockdowns per round, or a knockdown less than every 25 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jersey Joe Walcott knocked out Phil Johnson in Philadelphia on 
June 22, 1936, in the third round. Johnson's son, Harold, was stopped for the 
first time in his career on Feb. 8, 1950, by Walcott, also in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Muhammad Ali,in his years as Cassius Clay, the heavyweight contender, would 
write poems predicting the demise of his opponents. A sample, written before 
the Archie Moore bout: 
</P>
<P>
Archie had been living off the fat of the land 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here to give him his pension plan 
</P>
<P>
 When you come to the fight don't block aisle or door 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause y'all going home after Round 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clay won in the fourth."

<P>
ROYAL HUNCH PAYS OFF IN 2-1 VICTORY OVER A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Wathan, the Kansas City Royals' manager, went with his instincts Monday 
night against the Oakland Athletics, and came away with a victory and an 
improved position in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
With Kevin Seitzer at second and two out in the 11th, Jim Eisenreich worked the 
count to 3-and-1 before grounding a single up the middle, scoring Seitzer and 
pushing the Royals past the A's, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The victory at Kansas City, the Royals' fifth straight, moved the team past the 
Angels into second place in the American League West, 2 1/2 games behind the 
A's. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have to do what your instincts tell you to do," said Wathan, who 
allowed the left-handed Eisenreich to hit against left-handed reliever Greg 
Cadaret. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenreich, who was as surprised as any at Wathan's decision, said: "I didn't 
think there was any way I would bat. I kept looking over my shoulder to see 
(right-handed) Pat Tabler coming out of the dugout to pinch-hit." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa had brought Cadaret in from the bullpen in the 
11th to replace Todd Burns and face the left-handed George Brett, who grounded 
out. 
</P>
<P>
LaRussa ordered Cadaret to walk Bo Jackson intentionally, bringing up 
Eisenreich. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the matchup of Cadaret against the left-handers," LaRussa said. "Burns 
had already been in there for three innnings. I was proud of Greg. He made some 
good pitches to Brett and Eisenreich." 
</P>
<P>
It was the 14th time in 18 games that Oakland pitchers have allowed no more 
than two runs. The Athletics have won 11 of them. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals took a 1-0 lead in the second against Bob Welch on Jackson's 
opposite-field home run, his 15th. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics tied it, 1-1, in the sixth on a walk, Mark Gubicza's throwing 
error and an infield out. Mike Gallego, the No. 9 hitter, walked leading off 
and Luis Polonia dropped down a sacrifice bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Gubicza charged and attempted an off-balance throw to first that sailed wide 
for an error, allowing Gallego to go to third. After Dave Henderson struck out, 
Dave Parker grounded to second baseman Brad Wellman as Gallego scored the tying 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Corsi relieved Welch in the fourth when the right-hander pulled a groin 
muscle covering first base on a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Detroit 4 -- Kelly Gruber's fifth hit of the game, a two-run double 
with two out in the 11th inning, lifted the Blue Jays over the Tigers at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays took three of four games from the Tigers and spoiled Sparky 
Anderson's 10th year anniversary as Detroit manager. 
</P>
<P>
The five-hit game was the first of Gruber's career and made a winner of Tom 
Henke. Mike Heath had five hits for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff hit his 14th homer for Toronto, Gary Ward his second for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago White Sox 5, Cleveland 3 -- Steve Rosenberg won for the first time in 
five major league starts and Rich Yett was chased without retiring a batter at 
Chicago as the White Sox beat the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg allowed eight hits and three runs in 6 1/3 innings, striking out four 
and walking none. Donn Pall went 1 2/3 innings and Bobby Thigpen pitched a 
hitless ninth for his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Yett allowed two hits, walked two and hit a batter, and four of the five 
runners scored. It was the first time he has been knocked out in the first and 
his third straight defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Cory Snyder homered for Cleveland, his seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Cubs 10, St. Louis 3 -- Ryne Sandberg drove in three runs with three 
hits, including a two-run homer, and Jerome Walton had four hits for the first 
time in his career as the Cubs defeated the Cardinals at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
With Rick Sutcliffe sidelined with back spasms, Steve Wilson made his first 
major league start and allowed three hits in five innings, walking one and 
striking out three. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, activated Sunday from the disabled list, led off the first with a 
single and was forced by Dwight Smith. Sandberg followed with his eighth homer 
of the season and third in his last three at-bats against Scott Terry, who got 
the loss -- the Cardinals' first in six games.

JOHNSON ADMITS USING STEROIDS, BLAMES COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson admitted publicly for the first time Monday that 
he used anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing substances, beginning 
in the early 1980s, and that he was aware the drugs are banned by international 
sports federations. But he attempted to shift the blame to his coach of 11 
years, Charlie Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the coach," Johnson said. "I just took orders." 
</P>
<P>
On his first day of testimony before the Canadian government's commission of 
inquiry into drug use by athletes, Johnson, 27, also said that he would not 
have used steroids if Francis or Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who supervised the 
sprinter's drug program for four years between the 1984 and 1988 Summer 
Olympics, had warned him of the potential side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody took the time out to tell me what the side effects were," he said. 
"They were happy making money and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
In Johnson's only previous public statement on the subject, he said at a news 
conference here last Oct. 4 that he "never, ever knowingly used illegal drugs." 
That was two weeks after he had tested positive for a steroid at the Seoul 
Olympics and was forced to forfeit the gold medal and the world record of 9.79 
seconds that had resulted from his victory in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 56 days of testimony at the inquiry, which was commissioned 
by the Canadian government's sports ministry less than a week after Johnson 
tested positive, there was curiosity about whether the sprinter would stand by 
his original statement when called to testify under oath. 
</P>
<P>
To do so would have contradicted previous testimony by Francis, Astaphan and 
several of Johnson's teammates, who said they believed he knew he had used 
steroids and was aware of the potential consequences. 
</P>
<P>
It might also have jeopardized his future in track and field if the inquiry's 
commissioner, Ontario associate chief justice Charles L. Dubin, had chosen to 
believe the other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canadian Ban 
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which 
governs track and field, Johnson can return to competition when his two-year 
suspension ends on Sept. 24, 1990. But Canada's sports minister, Jean Charest, 
has banned him for life from representing the country in major international 
competition such as the Olympics and the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Charest, however, said he would reconsider depending on Dubin's recommendation, 
which is expected to be in a report due after the inquiry ends late this year. 
The commission is investigating other sports besides track and field to 
determine whether pressure put on Canadian athletes by the government's funding 
program has driven them to use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
There were 39 witnesses before Johnson, but his testimony was by far the most 
anticipated. About 200 reporters, most of them from Canada and the United 
States but some also from Britain, France and the Netherlands, awaited Johnson 
on Monday outside the downtown office building that was rented for the 
hearings. He arrived with an entourage of friends and family in a gray van with 
tinted windows. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not worked out regularly since the Olympics, he appeared fit. 
Wearing a dark gray pinstripe suit and a black tie, he would not have looked 
out of place among the dozen or so attorneys who are representing the various 
clients at the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's Questions 
</P>
<P>
The only one who asked Johnson questions Monday was the commission's 
co-counsel, Robert P. Armstrong. The others, including attorneys for Francis 
and Astaphan and Johnson's own attorney, will have their turns before the end 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
There were concerns about Johnson's ability to answer for himself. Although 
some people close to him have testified that he is neither as naive nor 
unwitting as his attorney has tried to portray him, Johnson, who came here from 
Jamaica when he was 14, has an accent and a speech impediment that often makes 
it difficult for others to understand him. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no such problem Monday. Although he seemed unable to recall 
certain details and sometimes contradicted himself on minor points, he appeared 
relaxed and confident and displayed a keen sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Francis' squeamish, fumbling attempt to inject him with a male 
hormone, testosterone, in 1985, Johnson laughed and said: "He was all shaky and 
stuff. I said, 'Not any more. You're not giving me any shots.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that he began working out with Francis' suburban track club in 
1977 and recalled that the coach introduced steroids to him in 1982 or 1983. 
But he agreed with Armstrong's suggestion that it could have been 1981, which 
is the year that Francis testified he first put Johnson on a drug program. 
Earlier that year, Johnson had shown his promise as a sprinter by finishing 
second in the 100 meters at the Canadian national championships. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'The whole world is taking these drugs,' and the only way I'm going 
to be better is to take these drugs," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he made no decision at the time but decided later that year to follow 
Francis' advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie was my coach," he said. "If he would give me something to take, I'd 
take them. That's the way it's supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he said that Francis did not tell him anything about the drugs, 
including their names, he said he suspected they were banned because the coach 
hid them from the other athletes at the track when he gave them to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
He said his suspicions were confirmed in the 1983 Pan American Games at 
Caracas, Venezuela, where conversations with other athletes convinced him that 
he had been given steroids by Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he realized at that time that he would be disqualified if he tested 
positive for a steroid, Johnson said that he had. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that neither Francis nor any of the other athletes in the club ever 
discussed the potential side effects of steroids. Medical evidence was 
introduced earlier by Johnson's attorney indicating that the sprinter had an 
elevated live enzyme count in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had told me all the side effects, I wouldn't have been part of the 
group at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few months before Johnson finished third in the 100 meters at the 1984 Los 
Angeles Olympics, he said Francis introduced him to Astaphan. By the end of the 
year, Johnson said Astaphan had taken over the administration of his drug 
program. Even though Astaphan returned to his native Caribbean island of St. 
Kitts in 1986, he continued to treat Johnson through the 1988 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan testified two weeks ago that he informed Johnson of the potential side 
effects of steroids and that the sprinter asked him if the drugs could cause 
damage to his liver, kidneys or heart. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Armstrong if that were true, Johnson snapped, "I'm not a doctor, no." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he would have disassociated himself from Astaphan if the doctor 
had warned about the side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not longer have been involved in any relationship at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't have taken drugs?" Armstrong asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Johnson said.

PROPAGANDA BLITZ UNLEASHED; 
</P>
<P>
IN CHINA'S MEDIA, OFFICIAL VIEW IS THE ONLY MESSAGE 
</P>

BEIJING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Day after day, hour after hour, Chinese government television shows waves of 
mostly youthful protesters attacking army trucks, tanks or armored cars. 
</P>
<P>
The only dead seen in the broadcast videotapes have been three charred corpses 
identified as soldiers. Every one of the injured shown so far has been a 
military man recovering in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In all the broadcasts, no shot fired by troops has been heard on the sound 
tracks, although witnesses heard and saw plenty of shooting June 4, when 
soldiers moved in force into the center of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
China's media are in the midst of a propaganda campaign of a kind not 
experienced here for more than a decade -- and perhaps not matched since the 
1950s campaign against what the government called rightist critics. 
</P>
<P>
Television especially is saturated with stories supporting the government 
version of events two weekends ago, when the army stormed into downtown Beijing 
and used live ammunition to roust pro-democracy demonstrators from Tian An Men 
Square. It has also emphasized the protesters' "criminal" nature with long 
reports on arrests of "thugs" throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is a textbook example of the official view here of mass 
communication more as a tool of unification and pacification than as an 
approach to the truth. 
</P>
<P>
In this time of crisis, persuasion appears to be secondary to another goal: 
letting everyone know what it is permissible to think. As a farmer in Tailing, 
a village outside Beijing, told a reporter: "Television says that the attacks 
were made by thugs. That is all I want to know." 
</P>
<P>
That is not a general attitude, at least here in the capital. Interviews with 
Beijing residents over the past nine days indicate that the effects of the 
propaganda deluge are more unpredictable than the government might like. 
</P>
<P>
One wild card is the role of the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting 
Corp., both of which beam news in the Mandarin dialect to China. Foreign radio 
has proven a formidable competitor to the official broadcasts. In random 
conversations, many citizens of the capital say they listen to one or both of 
the foreign outlets. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Voice of America, China has launched a large-scale effort to 
discredit its broadcasts by accusing it of deliberate misreporting. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, said Monday 
that the VOA could "hardly hide its excitement" over news of the protests at 
Tian An Men. It accused the radio of "spreading rumors," including exaggerated 
casualty tolls and stories about splits in the military. 
</P>
<P>
"VOA spread too many rumors," the People's Daily said. "They played their part 
in helping counterrevolutionary revolt in Beijing. . . . It is time for the VOA 
to take a rest." 
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to head off the foreigners' practice of sending 
in news clippings and leaflets by telephone fax machine. In radio broadcasts, 
the authorities said that they have stationed police by fax machines in China 
to intercept the messages and that any printed material "containing distorted 
propaganda" must be turned over to Beijing's Public Security Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intercepted Material 
</P>
<P>
In another example of state control of all communication, Chinese authorities 
have intercepted unedited ABC News material that was being transmitted to the 
United States by satellite and used it to arrest a man who spoke to an American 
news crew shortly after the martial-law crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The intercepted videotape was broadcast on state-run television Saturday 
evening, showing a middle-aged man speaking vehemently about the killings of 
protesters. The man admitted under questioning by a foreign journalist that he 
had not seen the killings himself. He then attributed his information to the 
Voice of America and added inaccurately that the American broadcast had 
reported 20,000 deaths. The Saturday night broadcast concluded with a plea for 
citizens to turn in the "rumormonger" to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The man appeared again on the Sunday night news, this time in police custody. 
</P>
<P>
Identified as Xiao Bin, 42, the man declared before police officials and a 
television camera: "I confess that I was guilty of making up rumors. If you 
call me a counterrevolutionary, I admit it." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for ABC News in New York objected strenuously to the interception 
of its material and the use of it "for political purposes." 
</P>
<P>
In response, U.S. television networks say they have begun to obscure the faces 
of dissidents interviewed here to prevent identification and retribution by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We began to electronically disguise all people interviewed in Beijing on our 
Sunday evening news programs," an ABC spokesman said from New York. CBS started 
to "blank out" faces in interviews, and NBC said it is showing only silhouettes 
of those who feared reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese have reacted to the propaganda onslaught in a variety of ways. Some 
simply dismiss the information -- at least in the privacy of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
During one news broadcast, residents of a small courtyard home in the capital's 
Qian Men district yelled "False! False!" in response to every official account 
of the events at Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Even Communist Party members, in private, may be heard to reject the official 
line. "The party should not lie to the people," said a four-year member who 
told a reporter that he was sickened by the army violence. 
</P>
<P>
Other Beijing residents have been merely skeptical, especially if they have 
heard foreign reports. Sometimes, when interviewed by a foreigner, Chinese are 
much more interested in finding out what a reporter knows than telling him what 
they think. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who are wary of expressing themselves, such as the farmer in 
Tailing, who viewed the state account as a guideline for staying out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Some would prefer not to hear any version. "I don't go outside to see or ask, 
and I don't watch television," said a proprietor of a small, private dumpling 
restaurant just a block off Tian An Men Square. "The way I look at it, the less 
you know, the better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firsthand Accounts 
</P>
<P>
It has not yet been possible to independently locate anyone in Beijing who is 
convinced by the official reports. This is due in part to the number of 
firsthand accounts of heavy shooting that have spread through the city. 
</P>
<P>
On government news programs, however, there have been numerous interviews with 
disgusted citizens who blame the students and other "counterrevolutionary 
rebels" for unprovoked attacks on soldiers and the state. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, interviewed in Shanghai, told state television that she watched news 
broadcasts of the mayhem in Beijing "four or five times a day." 
</P>
<P>
"It made me extremely angry, the burning of those buses and military vehicles," 
she said. "On top of that, people are spreading rumors, like it was the 
People's Liberation Army that burned the vehicles. Our army would never do that 
kind of thing! 
</P>
<P>
"Watching television . . . isn't it clear that it's the thugs who did this kind 
of destruction?" she asked. She began to cry as she added, "Yesterday, I saw 
that soldier who was burned up that way, and I felt terrible inside." 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed among such interviews were scenes of affection between common 
citizens and the army. In one, soldiers paid visits to a school and helped 
children wash windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, uncle," the children said. 
</P>
<P>
A peasant delivered three live pigs as a gift for one encampment of troops 
deployed in the capital. The perhaps obligatory scene of soldiers helping an 
old lady cross a street has been aired several times. 
</P>
<P>
The testimonies and tributes followed days of repetitive broadcasts of selected 
events from the June 4 weekend in and around Tian An Men Square that appear to 
throw full guilt on protesters. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, along a stretch of Changan Avenue in front of the Military 
Museum, a remote-control, black-and-white video camera recorded what appeared 
to be wave after wave of mob attacks on army tanks, armored cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The date and time of the action was shown at the bottom of the screen. 
Sometimes, from segment to segment, the clock would jump forward two hours, 
then backward five and then forward to the next day. No explanation was given 
for the unsequential editing, and only mob violence was shown. 
</P>
<P>
Youths identified as eyewitnesses in Tian An Men Square said all student 
demonstrators escaped unharmed. No mention is made of the violence on Changan 
or other thoroughfares or of the flatbed carts that were seen bearing bodies 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The one-sided slant is but an extreme example out of modern China's long 
history of communication at the service of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Officialdom's view of the media as mainly a propaganda tool predates Communist 
rule. As early as the first decades of the century, pioneer journalist Liang 
Qichao considered public opinion and its manipulation as a contributor to a 
stable state, not as a means of expressing contending views. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationalist government, which ruled China for a time after the fall of the 
Qing Dynasty, routinely censored books and newspapers critical of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The late Communist leader Mao Tse-tung argued that the role of the press was 
"to bring the party program, the party line, the party's general and specific 
policies . . . before the masses in the quickest and most extensive way." 
</P>
<P>
When in the late 1970s and early 1980s the Chinese press entered an uneven era 
of revealing public wrongs, a Communist Party leader in Canton warned editors 
and reporters: "Exposure of our dark side should not be too frequent nor too 
highly colored. Otherwise, people might get the wrong impression, weakening the 
party's prestige among the masses and affecting stability and unity in ways 
that are not beneficial to socialist construction." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Tian An Men incident, at least, the "dark side" of government has 
received no exposure at all.

DRUG SALE PRACTICES; 
</P>
<P>
IS MEDICINE INFECTED BY MARKETING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few of the millions of Americans who make the U.S. the largest consumer of 
prescription drugs in the world have heard of people like Shellie Rothstein. 
</P>
<P>
Rothstein, a pharmaceutical sales representative whose well-traveled turf is 
doctor-dense Beverly Hills, is a foot soldier in a highly competitive drug 
industry army dedicated to shaping physicians' decisions about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's weaponry is a mix of pedagogy and propaganda -- scientific 
papers, symposiums, research grants, stethoscopes, free samples, frequent-flier 
miles, resort weekends, lavish dinners, $500 honorariums and innumerable 
logo-imprinted pads and pens. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical marketing permeates American medicine to a degree few consumers 
understand. It plays a powerful and controversial role in the complex process 
by which prescription drugs travel from the laboratory to the patient's bedside 
table. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stakes Are Higher 
</P>
<P>
The techniques are not unlike those used by other businesses. They help sell 
everything from breakfast cereal to cars. The difference here is that the 
stakes are far higher and the choice of which drugs patients will take is made 
by a middleman -- the physician. 
</P>
<P>
For many doctors, drug industry marketing is their prime source of information 
about drugs, according to numerous studies. Some medical policy researchers 
believe that its influence eclipses that of professional societies, scientific 
journals and medical school education. 
</P>
<P>
As some physicians and drug industry experts see it, industry marketing is 
indispensable in keeping doctors up to date in a rapidly evolving field. With 
well over 8,000 prescription drugs on the market, they say the industry is 
essential to ensuring that drugs are properly used. 
</P>
<P>
But critics, including professors of medicine, hospital pharmacists and some 
consumer advocates, see a more insidious influence. They say the industry 
cultivates a taste for more drugs, the latest drugs, the most expensive drugs. 
The price of the industry's largess, they say, is paid by patients in the 
spiraling costs of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become a much more flagrant problem" in the last 20 years, said Dr. 
Roger Rosenblatt, a professor of family medicine at the University of 
Washington School of Medicine. "It infects medicine in a very deep way and 
there's much less public debate about it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost a conspiracy of silence in medicine that we will not discuss 
this hidden subsidy, this kind of hidden transfer from patients to 
pharmaceutical companies to doctors that occurs on a day-to-day basis," 
Rosenblatt asserted. 
</P>
<P>
A few recent examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Ayerst Laboratories offered physicians a round-trip ticket to any city served 
by American Airlines if they would prescribe the company's hypertension drug 
Inderal LA to 50 patients and send in details on specially provided, 
personalized prescription pads. 
</P>
<P>
* Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme invited health care managers and their spouses to an 
expenses-paid weekend at the Newporter Resort Hotel in Newport Beach. The 
subject of the symposium, managing patients with high cholesterol, was 
discussed for less than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
* Pfizer Laboratories picked up the tab for a weekend symposium at the Sheraton 
Scottsdale Resort in Arizona on the subject of "Cost Containment and Arthritis 
Therapy." Spouses or guests also received free accommodations -- but had to pay 
their own air fare. 
</P>
<P>
* The Veterans Administration this year disciplined 32 employees for accepting 
honorariums and "gratuities" from drug firms seeking to sell drugs to the VA. 
According to records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, one 
physician had accepted nearly $50,000 from a single firm. 
</P>
<P>
* Ortho Pharmaceutical invited physicians to participate in a drawing for a 
personalized Cross pen and pencil. In return, the doctors were to prescribe 
Ortho's birth-control pills and write on the order "Do not substitute" to 
prevent replacement with a cheaper equivalent. 
</P>

* Jelly beans, grooming sets, opportunities to be photographed with Captain 
America, umbrellas, playing cards and cappuccino were among the gimmicks used 
to attract doctors to sales booths at the recent convention of the American 
Academy of Family Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the meeting waited in line for up to an hour to have models shine 
their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market for prescription drugs is the world's largest, valued at $30 
billion. Drugstores dispensed 1.61 billion prescriptions in 1987. By some 
estimates, two out of every three times an American visits a doctor, a drug is 
prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
The industry that feeds that demand is highly competitive. No single 
pharmaceutical firm dominates the field. The four largest account for just 25% 
of industry sales, and no major company holds more than a 7% share of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Me-Too' Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Every year, the industry brings several dozen new drugs to market. All but a 
handful are so-called "me-too" drugs. That is, they represent little or no 
advance over what is already available, in regulators' opinions. But they 
present a marketing challenge. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 22 different penicillins available in the U.S. There are 
seven different beta blockers, for heart conditions, and 15 versions of the 
antibiotic cephalosporin. A new chemical entity is approved for human use on an 
average of every two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But prescription drugs cannot be peddled like other products. Federal 
regulations prohibit advertising them directly to consumers. Instead, firms 
must target their promotions to doctors, who make choices on behalf of 
consumers, who in turn pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of new drugs is a challenge to physicians as well as 
salesmen. About 70% of all drugs on the market were not around 15 years ago. 
Doctors find themselves forced to choose among products that did not exist when 
they were being trained. 
</P>
<P>
That rapid evolution intensifies the need for continuing medical education. The 
pharmaceutical industry, in cooperation with universities and professional 
groups, has stepped in with an abundance of symposiums and seminars to help 
fill that need. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a socially responsible role for us to take," said Grant 
Denison, president of U.S. operations for G. D. Searle &amp; Co. "Science has 
become so complex, the number of products so vast. Physicians have a crying 
need to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, doubt that the influence is entirely benign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Result of System 
</P>
<P>
"The education of American physicians about drugs . . . has (been) relegated to 
drug companies by default," charged Dr. Jerry Avorn, an associate professor at 
Harvard Medical School who has studied the influence of pharmaceutical 
marketing. "As a result, pharmacological solutions are thought of first, rather 
than nonpharmacological approaches that could be just as effective and safer." 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the marketing and promotion process is so-called detailing, 
a practice one physician likened to lobbying: In face-to-face encounters with 
physicians and pharmacists in offices and hospital corridors, sales reps sing 
the virtues of their products. 
</P>
<P>
As the industry and many doctors tell it, the aim is educational -- to supply 
practitioners with information about new drugs and refresh their memories about 
old ones. Sales people work closely with the profession to ensure optimal use 
of drugs, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But as critics tell it, the aim is propaganda -- to bombard doctors with often 
selectively compiled data, reinforcing the message through relentless repeat 
visits and ubiquitous "reminder items" such as pens, coffee cups and lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Detailing, which is almost entirely unregulated, is widely believed to be the 
most effective of all industry strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the company hinges on that sales representative," said Jim Shamp, 
manager of media relations for Glaxo Inc., the nation's third-largest drug 
company in prescription drug sales. "That's where the rubber hits the road." 
</P>
<P>
Shellie Rothstein is Glaxo's top representative in the Western region, a 
33-year-old pharmacist who left a job with the drug information service at the 
University of Chicago for what she calls "real-world medicine." She is one of 
1,600 Glaxo representatives nationwide; the company hopes to increase that 
number to 2,000 by the year 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Rothstein's territory includes 500 physicians and pharmacists, to whom she 
promotes four Glaxo products. Her success or failure is reflected in her annual 
earnings -- a salary plus a commission based on sales in the ZIP codes she 
traverses. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, her itinerary began with a visit to a gastroenterologist 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He had recently returned from speaking at a 
medical conference, with Glaxo's help. Glaxo had covered the costs of his air 
fare, hotel and honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
Later came an infectious-disease specialist who lectures on antibiotics, 
including Glaxo's, at local hospitals, sometimes with a Glaxo honorarium. 
Rothstein also stopped in at three pharmacies, two hospitals and the office of 
a Beverly Hills internist. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, she dispensed information and a few freebies -- Glaxo pens, 
pads, note-pad holders, pill-counting trays, pamphlets and books. In each 
doctor's office, she checked the free-sample cabinet and replenished the supply 
of Glaxo drugs at the physician's request. 
</P>
<P>
All her clients described Rothstein and Glaxo as highly ethical. They described 
their dealings with the company as mutually beneficial. One crusty pharmacist, 
however, described detailing with some ambivalence, saying it was useful but he 
disliked the "gimmicks." 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we call brainwashing . . . to remember the drug," cracked Max 
Stollman, who runs the Family Pharmacy on the fringe of Beverly Hills. He was 
pondering a black Glaxo pill-counting tray and two Glaxo pens and scratch pads 
he had just received. 
</P>
<P>
Rothstein looked incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you really believe that, Max?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, sure. Getting the name across is the name of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't he reject the offer? a reporter asked Stollman. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't want to refuse it," he said. "That's rude." 
</P>
<P>
Drug companies' generosity extends far beyond counting trays. 
</P>
<P>
Sales representatives buy lunches for a physicians' office staff -- to "make 
their day a little nicer," as Rothstein put it. Some cater lunches to coincide 
with meetings of entire medical center departments, or sponsor lunches with 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Firms invite physicians to dinner at well-known hotels and restaurants, serving 
up a free meal and a speaker on a topic of interest. In addition to picking up 
the tab, firms often reimburse the dining doctors "for their time." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Calvin Kunin, a professor at Ohio State University, said he recently turned 
down a drug company representative's invitation to attend a dinner at a hotel 
in downtown Columbus, listen to an after-dinner talk and receive $100 for his 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Grants 
</P>
<P>
Drug companies also give large grants to physicians working in academic medical 
centers to study the companies' products. In some cases, they pay the 
researchers by the patient -- up to several thousand dollars per patient 
enrolled, some researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the practice say it is reasonable: Who better to study a new drug 
objectively than academic researchers? But some critics suspect that firms use 
some grants to win coveted spots on the hospital's formulary, the list of drugs 
approved for regular use. 
</P>
<P>
Many large companies sponsor symposiums at resort cities. The topic is less 
likely to be the company's product than some condition it treats. The firms 
foot the bill for not only the speakers but often for the carefully selected 
"thought leaders" flown in to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Goldfinger recalls an invitation sent several years ago to 
directors of gastroenterology training programs; each was invited to designate 
one young trainee to a two-day symposium in Florida, all expenses paid by the 
sponsoring drug company. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfinger, associate dean for continuing education and associate professor of 
medicine at Harvard Medical School, calls such arrangements "manipulative 
pedagogy." 
</P>
<P>
"No person attending such a conference should have any doubt about either the 
fundamental motives of its sponsor or the high quality of the market research 
that determines how doctors can be influenced," he wrote in The New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"The assumption that one can accept the blandishments without any risk of being 
compromised is incredibly naive, but even if it were true, would that make it 
right?" Goldfinger asked. "Indeed, isn't it a bit sleazy to take the corsage 
without at least yielding its sender a place on one's dance card?" 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes toward pharmaceutical promotions vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
Most physicians accept and welcome the activities, according to both the 
industry and research on the subject. Those physicians say the information and 
funding helps them and their patients. They say they are capable of judging 
critically anything the industry offers. 
</P>
<P>
One physician, responding to Goldfinger, charged in a letter that Goldfinger's 
criticisms in the journal article "smacked of holier-than-thou moralism that 
harks back to a bygone era." The industry is not the Evil Empire, the doctor 
argued; it is an equal partner. 
</P>
<P>
"I see absolutely nothing wrong with providing a physician medical-education 
events. They are busy people," said Denison of G. D. Searle &amp; Co. "I think 
that's a very, very appropriate role for us to take as a pharmaceutical 
company." 
</P>
<P>
"Good will is certainly a part of it, with no apologies," said Shamp of Glaxo. 
"But it's a whole lot more complex than giving someone a cigar or buying favor 
with a pen. You're selling to a highly ethical, highly skeptical middle-person 
who would not ever be swayed." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, find the practices distasteful. Kunin, of the University of 
Ohio, has a policy of seeing no sales representatives. He calls paid dinners 
"payola." He says he keeps himself up to date by reading the medical journals 
and attending scientific meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"A physician is responsible to keep up and should devote the time to that," 
said Kunin, who has examined the relationship between researchers and the 
pharmaceutical industry. "That's what they went to medical school for and this 
is a service profession." 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be little doubt that drug promotion is highly effective. 
</P>
<P>
In one study on the subject, Avorn of Harvard Medical School examined 
physicians' perceptions of two heavily advertised prescription drugs. Both 
drugs had been shown in scientific studies to differ little from the 
non-prescription versions. 
</P>
<P>
According to Avorn's published report, he found that the perceptions of many of 
the physicians were shaped by advertising rather than scientific literature. 
Yet they were unaware, or unwilling to admit, that they had been influenced by 
non-scientific sources. 
</P>
<P>
The danger, Avorn and others argue, is "irrational prescribing" -- the use of 
inappropriate drugs or inappropriate doses. Such practices may contribute to 
what some researchers believe, and some studies suggest, is a significant 
problem of physician-induced illness. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians are prescribing sleeping pills for problems that could be cured 
through diet and life style, Avorn contends. Expensive new anti-depressants and 
drugs for hypertension and cholesterol are being used where older drugs, or no 
drug, would suffice, he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resistant Strains 
</P>
<P>
Excessive use of antibiotics to treat trivial infections is contributing to 
resistant strains of micro-organisms, Kunin argues. Money is being spent on 
developing, and purchasing, new generations of antibiotics to fight new 
resistant strains. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, pharmaceutical detailing is almost entirely unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has no authority over the practice, according 
to Kenneth Feather, acting director of the division of drug advertising and 
labeling. In his 17 years with the office, Feather can recall no action ever 
taken against detailing. 
</P>
<P>
A few institutions and individuals have begun exploring ways of controlling the 
influence of pharmaceutical promotions -- without, some of them say, 
excessively restricting an industry that has made many important contributions 
to medical care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unbiased Information 
</P>
<P>
One approach entails a practice sometimes called "public interest detailing" or 
"counter-detailing." Pharmacists or other health professionals use the 
techniques of the drug companies to promulgate what they contend is unbiased 
drug information. 
</P>
<P>
In a pilot program, Avorn and other researchers found that public-interest 
detailing accomplished a 14% reduction in prescribing of the drugs being 
studied. An expanded program could save government health insurance programs 
millions of dollars, Avorn estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Permanente, with 2 million members in Southern California, has quietly 
implemented a program in which pharmacists and physicians work together to 
evaluate drugs, taking into account both their therapeutic benefits and their 
cost-effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Connecticut, a new seminar series for doctors in training 
examines pharmaceutical marketing in hopes of turning out new physicians 
capable of critically evaluating information provided by drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
In England, the Royal College of Physicians has suggested that gifts be 
accepted only if they will not impair judgment. The size of any gift should be 
such that the physician would be willing to have the arrangement known 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
A few skeptics, however, wonder whether moderation is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps some middle ground can be found that will resolve the ethical morass 
in which we find ourselves," Rosenblatt wrote recently. "However, I suspect 
that as in many types of addictive behavior, only one therapy will ultimately 
be effective -- abstinence."

The wife of House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles) earned 
more than $100,000 in each of the last two years on Los Angeles International 
Airport concessions contracts designed to help economically disadvantaged 
businesses, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one contract, neither Betty Dixon nor her partners in two firms 
apparently have served in the type of direct management role intended by a 
government program for minority- and women-run firms. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dixon is one of 10 partners who were selected by Duty Free Shoppers Group 
Ltd. Partnership, the world's largest duty-free concessionaire, to boost its 
minority and female participation and thus its chances of winning contracts to 
operate gift shops at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, who until last year operated her own gift shop in Washington and still 
has a business there, said in an interview that she has not served in any 
hands-on management position in one Los Angeles airport contract and has been 
involved only "on a limited basis" in another. 
</P>
<P>
"We set policy, but I have not taken part in any hands-on management as such," 
Dixon said of her partnership. "However, I'm going to try to work at our two 
(airport) terminals sometime during the summer." She added that she is learning 
about the airport concessions business as required by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Julian Dixon, who recently gained national prominence while 
presiding over the Ethics Committee probe that led to the resignation of House 
Speaker Jim Wright, amended his 1986 financial disclosure form to list his 
wife's initial investment in the two firms as less than $15,000. The action 
came after the Dixons were questioned by The Times and the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon told the Associated Press on Monday that there was nothing improper about 
his wife's business arrangement and that she was the "ideal person" to sit on 
the companies' boards because she has a background in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the California investment has been "better than we ever expected," 
Dixon said he was "sorry that I made that mistake" in not disclosing the cost 
of the investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I feel badly about it," said Dixon, who was not available to The 
Times on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The more than $100,000 in earnings Dixon reported was his wife's share of the 
minority firms' income from the concessions agreements. According to the same 
financial report, his wife also received unspecified annual directors' fees of 
more than $1,000. In addition to the earnings, Dixon reported, the value of his 
wife's less-than-$15,000 investment in the firms had increased, in about six 
months, to between $100,000 and $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disadvantaged' Participants 
</P>
<P>
Federal contracting policies established in the early 1980s require that some 
government contracts be awarded to "disadvantaged businesses" run by minorities 
and women. Under the program, minority and women contractors are required to 
play a direct role in management and operations in order to gain first-hand 
experience that eventually will allow them to compete for contracts on their 
own, said Vincent Joubert, civil rights officer for the Federal Aviation 
Administration's Western Pacific Region. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dixon and her partners have "no direct operating responsibility" under 
one contract for several airport gift shops and newsstands while sharing 18% in 
total gross sales for these shops, said Joe Lyons, vice president of business 
development for Duty Free Shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said she has served in an advisory capacity as a director of the two 
firms, known as Mir Kanon Inc. and Peideau Inc., since 1986, but holds no other 
titles. She said that she has been "partially" involved in operation of the 
airport concessions by attending quarterly board meetings and on occasion 
monthly management sessions to oversee Mir Kanon and Peideau as well as the 
duty-free and gift shop businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely interested in learning the business from the ground up," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dixon contended that, despite participating "on a limited basis" in the 
airport shops, she has been "involved in a great deal to understand that 
business." She said her involvement included spending about one week of every 
month reviewing business operations for the duty-free shops, but no time at the 
news and gift stands. 
</P>
<P>
She said she could not work inside the airport shops because she operated her 
own retail shop in Washington, "Much Ado About Something," until it was closed 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also said that she did not feel she needed to spend time in the gift 
shops or newsstands because she already had retail experience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guidelines Explained 
</P>
<P>
Joubert, the FAA civil rights officer, said that serving on an advisory 
committee is "not acceptable" under government guidelines as a level of 
participation for minority- or women-owned businesses. He said that the FAA 
requires "meaningful management and control" by such partners. 
</P>
<P>
Joubert said the firms ought to be participating in the everyday operations of 
the concessions in proportion to the amount of the firms' ownership. Those 
amounts are 20% for Mir Kanon and 12% for Peideau. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind that the whole point of the program is to get disadvantaged 
partners involved in industry where they have not been involved before," 
Joubert said. "Without some involvement there's no way learning is going to 
take place (and) no way to eventually become competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Mir Kanon and Peideau were formed in 1985, shortly before Duty Free Shoppers 
brought the group members into their proposal, as joint venture partners, to 
win a competitively bid Airport Commission contract for Duty Free to run 
tax-free gift shops for international travelers. Mir Kanon qualified as a 
minority-run business enterprise, while Peideau qualified as one run by women. 
Both firms have the same 10 partners. 
</P>
<P>
Duty Free's Lyons said those gift shops had $69 million in sales last year. Mir 
Kanon and Peideau shared in 28% of the profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Duty Free, seeking to get a five-year extension on another 
of its airport concessions contracts -- for news stands and regular gift shops 
-- promised the Airport Commission it would increase minority participation and 
later brought in Mir Kanon and Peideau for that contract. There was no 
competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials could find no records that showed Mir Kanon or Peideau were 
given the gift and newsstand contract. 
</P>
<P>
"How those (minority) companies came in and what they are doing, I don't know," 
said Barbara Williams, the airport official who normally reviews minority 
business programs. "Nothing in my records indicates what they do." Had airport 
officials known about the arrangement, Williams added, it would not have been 
approved without evidence of direct participation. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 minority partners include private business associates and political 
allies of Mayor Tom Bradley, including Myrlie Evers, a member of the mayor's 
Board of Public Works. Although the contracts were approved by Bradley 
appointees on the city's Board of Airport Commissioners, there is no indication 
that the mayor played any role in selecting the minority partners. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Betty Dixon and Evers, the partners are: Desmonia Reese, wife of 
Bradley's former law partner, James N. Reese; Chih Hsing Pei and Hiawatha 
Harris, both principals in a real estate investment company, Peiming Inc., in 
which Bradley is an investor; insurance executive Iris D. Rideau; Alabama 
businesswoman Gwen Scott-Taylor; prominent Atlanta businessmen Jesse Hill Jr.; 
Felker W. Ward Jr. and Herman Russell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Donations 
</P>
<P>
All 10 individuals in the partnership have contributed a total of $85,531 to 
the mayor's political campaigns since they first incorporated in 1985, records 
show. In addition, Duty Free Shoppers has given $42,700 in campaign funds to 
Bradley over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
FAA guidelines in awarding minority contracts require that individuals should 
be "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said Monday they are reviewing their contracts with Duty Free 
Shoppers and the two minority firms to determine whether they are legal and 
meet the intent of the city's minority contracting policy. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. expressed concern in an interview about the 
contracts involving Mrs. Dixon's firms and said the airport has a 
responsibility to audit the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
In filing his amended financial statement Monday, Julian Dixon disclosed that 
his wife paid between $5,000 and $15,000 for a 12% interest in the two minority 
firms in July, 1986, three months after the companies were given the concession 
for duty-free shops at the airport. He said that he initially omitted stating 
how much his wife paid to get into the investments because of a 
misunderstanding about what had to be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not and am not personally or legally involved in this business 
transaction of my wife's," Dixon wrote in an accompanying letter to the House 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
The paid activities of congressional spouses have come under increased scrutiny 
because of the ethics debate touched off by former Speaker Wright. Among the 
charges Julian Dixon's Ethics Committee brought against Wright was that his 
wife received an $18,000-a-year salary, use of a condominium and a used 
Cadillac from a Ft. Worth developer while doing a minimum of work. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the 10 minority partners besides Betty Dixon returned phone calls 
to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles insurance executive Rideau said, "I've been in business for myself 
for 22 years and I've never had to tell a reporter what I do. I'm very 
successful in my businesses that I manage, and I'm very private. I don't care 
to say anything more than that other than it's working very well . . . and we 
have no complaints at all." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how much money each of the minority partners has earned because 
the city Department of Airports has never audited its contractual arrangements 
with Mir Kanon and Peideau. No audits have been ordered because neither Duty 
Free Shoppers nor its minority business partners appeared dissatisfied with the 
arrangement, said Donald Miller, executive deputy director of the city's 
Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the feeling is if anything is amiss . . . we would have heard from 
them," Miller said. "On the surface, everything seems to be working. . . . 
There are no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
The minority firms have operating responsibilities for duty-free shops in 
Terminals 3 and 5, Duty Free's Lyons said. "They have control and are 
responsible for staffing and management," he said, explaining that the manager 
of the shops reports through Pei, a principal in both minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the minority firms are gaining experience in the duty-free shops 
through Pei's involvement, participation in management committee meetings and 
Duty Free Shoppers' agreement to train several minority workers in its 
warehouse and merchandising operations. The airport's Williams also said she 
was satisfied with the minority involvement in the duty-free portion of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But the shops managed by Mir Kanon and Peideau appear to function identically 
to other airport duty-free shops -- using the same Duty Free Shoppers logos, 
uniforms and signs. An employee of one of the minority-managed shops said it 
was run by Duty Free Shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons acknowledged that Duty Free Shoppers hires workers, issues the payroll, 
orders merchandise and keeps the books. He said Pei "doesn't pay any bills. We 
would pay the bills. But she would approve the bills." 
</P>
<P>
As for the newsstands and gift shops contract, the firms involving Mrs. Dixon 
have no operating responsibilities. "They could, but they don't," he said. "We 
just didn't set (part of the operation) aside. I don't know why not." 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two firms has a city business license to currently operate 
retail shops in Los Angeles, records show. 
</P>
<P>
The office locations of Mir Kanon and Peideau and the nature of their business 
are not known. 
</P>
<P>
State corporation records list a Culver City address for the two firms. The 
office at that location bears the name of Rideau &amp; Associates Insurance. 
Iris Rideau is listed as the president of Peideau in state records. 
</P>
<P>
But a woman listed as the registered agent of Mir Kanon and Peideau, Joyce 
Green, said Friday that the two firms are headquartered elsewhere in the city. 
But she would not say where. 
</P>
<P>
A second address for Mir Kanon on Wilshire Boulevard turned out to be the 
psychiatry office of minority partner Hiawatha Harris. Harris is listed as 
president of Mir Kanon, although there was no indication that the firm is doing 
business out of the psychiatrist's office. 
</P>
<P>
Harris refused to speak with a reporter.

GRIM REPORT NOTES SEVERELY DEPLETED WHALE POPULATIONS 
</P>

<P>
The International Whaling Commission's scientific committee released a grim 
report Monday indicating that the populations of some whale species are much 
smaller than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
The most seriously depleted is the blue whale, the Earth's largest animal, 
whose number is estimated at 453, but could be as low as 200. Before the advent 
of widespread commercial whaling, there were an estimated 250,000 blue whales 
in Antarctic waters. Recent estimates had put their numbers at 6,000 to 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we are is far, far worse than any of us had foreseen," said Roger Payne, 
a research scientist with the World Wildlife Fund. "I now think that the 
question of whether blue whales will actually survive . . . has suddenly come 
open again." 
</P>
<P>
The report is the result of eight years of research on whale populations in the 
Southern Hemisphere. It was made public as the commission began its annual 
meeting, which is being held in the United States for the first time since 
1971. The session is the commission's last before its worldwide ban on 
commercial whaling comes up for review next year. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific committee's report also noted a seriously depleted population of 
fin whales, which now are estimated at from 2,096 to 4,000. Both species are 
now "only a very small fraction" of their pre-whaling levels, the committee 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The fin whale population was estimated at 500,000 before widespread whaling, 
according to World Wildlife Fund figures, and in recent years had been thought 
to number about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The research also showed an unexpectedly low 4,047 humpback whales and 3,059 
sperm whales, but noted that the survey area south of 60 degrees latitude 
excluded much of the normal habitat for those species. 
</P>
<P>
Before the session began Monday, Iceland announced it will halt its 
controversial research whaling program after this year. Iceland has complied 
with the worldwide ban on commercial whaling that took effect in 1986, but has 
been killing about 90 whales a year since then under an exception for 
scientific research. The whale meat from those catches is sold commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which complies with the commercial ban under protest and kills several 
hundred whales each year for "research," took a tougher stand Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Regretfully, there is a seemingly irreparable split in the commission, with 
one culture seeking only to destroy the other," said Kazuo Shima, the Japanese 
delegate, in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
"What has developed here is the dominance of the meat-eating culture over the 
fish-eating culture," Shima said. "Despite our great sacrifices, and our 
efforts to ensure conservation, we continue to be vilified by the meat-eating 
cultures because we hope some day to restore whale meat to our diets."

QUAKE DOES LITTLE HARM, BUT IT JOGS THE MEMORY

As soon as the jolt struck his Mobil station in Montebello, the epicenter of 
Monday's earthquake, Al Louie went into his emergency routine: He turned off 
the gasoline pumps, checked the station for damage, then took off in his car. 
</P>
<P>
First stop was his house five miles away, where his wife was in the yard 
watering the grass, "so I knew everything was OK." Then he drove by Schurr High 
School, where one of his four children is a student. "Everybody was out in the 
field, so I figured it was OK, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were, indeed, no reports of serious damage or injuries in the epicenter 
area. But Montebello and the surrounding communities are just west of Whittier, 
where the region's last major earthquake caused extensive damage in 1987, and 
the latest temblor brought back frightening memories for residents. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after Monday's quake and its sharp aftershock, Cora Valeriano kept 
the door to the courtyard open at the De Paul Center, a 14-acre Montebello 
compound for religious retreats. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 shaker severely damaged the center's brick chapel and gym and toppled 
a marble statue of St. Vincent, whose head was severed when it hit the ground, 
smashing through the glass door before rolling to a stop in front of 
Valeriano's office. 
</P>
<P>
"This one scared the heck out of us," she said Monday. "When it hit, I just 
held onto the door frame. And as soon as it settled down, we ran outside." 
</P>
<P>
Valeriano, a secretary at the center, spent the next hour outside with several 
other employees, taking no chances. The facility was being used Monday for the 
annual retreat of eighth graders from St. Bruno's, a Roman Catholic school in 
Whittier. "These kids were through the worst of it the last time," Valeriano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Monday's 4.5-magnitude quake struck, the youngsters were starting a "trust 
walk," an interpersonal exercise in which they close their eyes while being 
escorted through the grounds by partners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under a Walkway 
</P>
<P>
"We were under this walkway thing when it started shaking," said Rudy 
Ceniseroz, 14, pointing to a structure between two buildings, supported by 
columns. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to run because I thought it was going to fall," said classmate Chris 
Gorny. "We immediately think, 'Get to a grassy area.' " 
</P>
<P>
Teachers quickly gathered them on a lawn for a "count-off." After all 27 
students were accounted for, the students fell into giggling banter -- boys 
insisting that the girls were the only ones scared and the girls responding, 
"Yeah, right." 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are fine," concluded Judee Mattson, religious education director at 
the school. "The adults are not so fine." 
</P>
<P>
Reports were similar in surrounding communities. At the Uptown Preschool in 
central Whittier, director Alice De Leon reported that excited students dived 
under the tables, shouting: "Oh good, it's an earthquake!" 
</P>
<P>
"People in our area have been more vigilant -- if not hypervigilant," said 
Albert H. Arenowitz of the Intercommunity Child Guidance Center in Whittier, 
which counseled several hundred people after the October, 1987, quake. 
</P>
<P>
"They do their drills, they keep their flashlights at their bedside," he said. 
"From a psychological point of view, if you are prepared, I think your anxiety 
level won't be quite as high." 
</P>
<P>
But several miles to the west, in Bell, Vickie Moon became one of the day's 
minor casualties when she cut two fingers trying to hide under a counter in a 
Purity liquor store and market. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time, many friends were hurt in Whittier when things fell on them," 
she said. "This time we were the center. I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
A block down Gage Avenue, 300-pound Jesse Gonzales stunned a dozen other people 
washing their clothes at a laundry when he bolted out the door to safety. "I 
was the first one out of there," he said. "They didn't think I could move that 
fast."

NEWLY FOUND FAULT LINE BLAMED FOR RECENT JOLTS

<P>
The 4.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Monday near Montebello was but the 
latest in an unusual rash of temblors in the region over the last three years, 
and bolstered a growing sense among scientists that a newly discovered fault 
running from Whittier to Malibu could be an active supplier of moderate or even 
strong quakes. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes have occurred in Los Angeles and surrounding cities more frequently 
in the last three years than during any other period since roughly 1930, when 
detailed recording of earthquake activity began, seismologists and scientists 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the most significant of these temblors -- including the quake 
Monday, which was followed by an almost equally sharp aftershock -- have 
occurred on a deeply buried thrust fault that was unknown to the experts until 
after the Whittier earthquake of Oct. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Named the Elysian Park Fault, it follows hill lines extending from Whittier 
through Montebello, Elysian Park and the Cahuenga and Sepulveda passes to 
Malibu and Point Dume, but it never breaks the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Experts from Caltech, USC and the U.S. Geological Survey agreed at a briefing 
Monday afternoon at Caltech that at some time in the future, the Elysian Park 
Fault could generate a quake in the magnitude 7 range. Since the fault passes 
underneath downtown Los Angeles and other highly populated parts of the Los 
Angeles Basin, this constitutes a sobering prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accelerated Rate 
</P>
<P>
The experts said the accelerated rate of quakes does not say anything -- at 
least, that they now can understand -- about the probability of a really big 
quake hitting soon. The major quakes that struck Long Beach in 1933 and the San 
Fernando Valley in 1971 were isolated events. 
</P>
<P>
One seismologist, Lucile Jones of the Geological Survey's Pasadena office, said 
that the succession of moderate quakes in recent months increases chances that 
those in the near future will be of similarly moderate power. 
</P>
<P>
Before the spring of 1986, Jones said, there was usually about one 
4.5-magnitude earthquake in the Los Angeles area every three years. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, there have been six quakes of equal or stronger strength, 
ranging up to the 5.9 Whittier temblor. This does not count two of the 
significant aftershocks to the Whittier quake. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of small earthquakes, in the 2-magnitude range, has just 
about doubled, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that during the period 1938 through 1942, Los Angeles experienced a 
similar increase in the frequency of moderate quakes, and USC geologist Egill 
Hauksson recalled that in the late 1940s, there were several 5.5- to 
6.5-magnitude earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault near Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Neither episode of high-quake frequency was followed by a giant quake, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake more than we did 
yesterday," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, the quake on a segment of the Elysian Park Fault several miles 
west of the segment that caused the Whittier quake "confirms that we have an 
active fault structure west of where we've had it in the past." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considerable Distance 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists said that quakes off Malibu in January and near Point Dume in 
1973 now appear to have been on the Elysian Park Fault system, indicating that 
it is active over a considerable distance. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Sieh, a Caltech geologist, said: "Not any of us would be surprised to 
have a flurry of 5s and 6s on this fault in the next 30 years. I would not be 
surprised by a 7.5." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we could rule out a 6.5- or 7-magnitude quake," Jones agreed. 
</P>
<P>
A 7.5 quake would be 1,000 times stronger than the Monday quake, which 
incidentally was only about one-twentieth as strong as the 5.9-magnitude 
Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Sieh said that certain studies indicate that over the last 2 million years 
there has been an average movement of several millimeters a year along the 
Elysian Park Fault system. Over the last 100 years, there has apparently been 
very little movement -- "so we may see more," he said, a prediction based 
strictly on the law of averages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study of Earthquakes 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the San Andreas and the state's other well-known fault systems, in which 
earth on opposite sides scrapes sideways, the Elysian Park Fault thrusts the 
earth on one side upward, while the other side slips lower. This process 
creates great folds on the surface that can be seen in the form of the 
Whittier, Montebello and Hollywood hills. 
</P>
<P>
After the San Francisco quake disaster of 1906, the study of earthquakes in 
California focused for decades on the state's great surface faults, its 
so-called strike-slip faults. For the most part, experts concentrated on the 
San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
After the Whittier earthquake, however, considerable attention began to be paid 
to the thrust, or dip-slip, faults. After recognition of the Elysian Park 
Fault, scientists said the destructive Coalinga quake of 1983 and the 
Sylmar-San Fernando quake of 1971 could have been caused by other dip-slip 
faults. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hills Pushed Higher 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake Monday, as did the Whittier one, had its epicenter deep beneath 
the surface, in this case eight or nine miles, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier quake, USC's Hauksson said, thrust the Whittier Hills up about two 
inches higher than they had been before. Monday's smaller quake probably made 
the Montebello Hills about 0.2 inches of an inch higher than before, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The shaking of the latest quake was very similar to the kind felt in the 
Whittier quake, only less, Hauksson said. 
</P>
<P>
Since scientists became aware of the Elysian Park and possibly other thrust 
faults in the greater Los Angeles region, there has been some attempt to map 
the subsurface cleavages, but this undertaking has not yet been anywhere near 
as extensive as the charting of surface faults. 
</P>
<P>
Hauksson said Monday that while such mapping could delineate potential hazard 
zones, it would "not say anything about probabilities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ELYSIAN PARK FAULT -- The Elysian Park fault was unknown to scientists 
until after the 5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake of Oct. 1, 1987. But since 
then, this deeply buried, fold-and-thrust fault has come to be appreciated as 
perhaps one of the most dangerous in the Los Angeles area. Extending along hill 
lines northwestward from the Whittier Hills through the Montebello Hills, East 
Los Angeles, Elysian Park, the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains 
to the coast off Malibu and Point Dume, the fault, which never comes to the 
surface, may be capable of generating a quake as strong as magnitude 7, 
scientists believe.

NAVY EASES BAN ON BATTLESHIP BIG GUNS 
</P>

<P>
In an indication that equipment failure is no longer considered a prime suspect 
in the April explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, the Navy has partially 
lifted its ban on the firing of the unique 16-inch guns aboard the nation's 
four battleships, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The firing moratorium, imposed a day after a blast ripped through a 16-inch gun 
turret aboard the Iowa April 19, has been modified to permit the use of the 
guns in wartime, for self-defense and during operations designed to send 
political signals to foreign nations, according to Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
A naval commander also would be permitted to order firing of the 16-inch guns 
at special training exercises for a crew being sent on a potentially hazardous 
operation overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The skippers of the nation's four battleships -- the only warships equipped 
with the massive, 1940s-vintage guns -- received word of the new guidelines 
over the weekend. Chief of Naval Operations Carlisle A. H. Trost issued the new 
orders before results of the Navy's investigation of the Iowa blast, which 
killed 47 sailors, reached senior leaders at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
That probe has focused on human factors as the likeliest causes of the 
explosion, rather than on structural flaws that might pose continuing danger, 
knowledgeable defense officials said. Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan is 
directing that investigation, the findings of which were called "inconclusive" 
by one knowledgeable Pentagon official. Suicide by a member of the gun crew is 
being considered as one possible cause. 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, Navy officials have emphasized the guns' long record 
of firing without incident. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Iowa-class battleships have fired more than 13,000 16-inch rounds 
safely since they were first commissioned in the 1940s. The Iowa alone had 
fired 3,500 rounds without incident. Similar explosions, involving the Navy's 
8-inch and 14-inch guns, occurred in 1972 aboard the heavy cruiser Newport News 
and in 1943 aboard the battleship Mississippi. But neither of those guns remain 
in use. 
</P>
<P>
The partial lifting of the firing ban came less than a week after the Iowa left 
its home port in Norfolk, Va., for a deployment in the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable Navy official said the partial lifting of the firing ban also 
would send the message to would-be aggressors in that area -- including Libya 
-- that the Iowa is not defenseless and that it can project American might if 
needed. The 16-inch guns can hurl shells 23 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"The chief of naval operations wanted to make it clear that even with an 
investigation under way, if you're attacked, you can defend yourself," said a 
senior Navy official.

Britain told China on Monday that it should immediately release a Hong Kong 
student arrested in Shanghai and warned that any maltreatment of Hong Kong 
Chinese would have damaging repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canada recalled its ambassador to China for consultations to protest 
the military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators, External Affairs 
Minister Joe Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Ambassador Earl Drake will be brought back to Ottawa by the end of 
the week to talk about what the Canadian government can do to influence events 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is working with other countries to try to 
"encourage the Chinese government to respect the whole democratic process that 
has been shown through the demonstrations by the students and other people in 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Canada, with $2.9 billion in two-way trade and no arms sales to China, has 
little power to force authorities to ease their strong-arm tactics, political 
analysts say. But Canada, with more than 360,000 Canadians of Chinese origin, 
feels it has a special relationship. Canada was one of the first Western 
countries to recognize Communist China in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gravely Concerned 
</P>
<P>
In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said that Deputy Undersecretary David 
Gillmore told Chinese Charge d'Affaires Song Mingjiang that Britain is gravely 
concerned over the detention of Yao Yongzhan -- described as a leader of 
Shanghai's outlawed Autonomous Student Union -- who was seized at the city's 
airport as he attemped to leave Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We urged that Yiu Yung Chin (as Yao's name is rendered in Cantonese) should be 
immediately returned to Hong Kong," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
And the governor of Hong Kong, in the wake of what he called appalling events 
in China, appealed to the British government to deal generously with Hong Kong 
before the colony returns to Beijing's rule. 
</P>
<P>
David Wilson, urging the government to allow Hong Kong citizens the right of 
entry to Britain, said: "If the worst came to the worst, Britain has a very 
strong moral obligation." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, addressing the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, was 
outlining an "Armageddon scenario" for Hong Kong after Britain hands the colony 
back to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a committee member whether Britain should try to wrest more 
concessions, Wilson said: "It is more a question of adding on to rather than to 
start renegotiating. My concept is remedial." He said he was referring 
specifically to the right of Hong Kong people to enter Britain and the 
deployment of Chinese troops in Hong Kong after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Crew Detained 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Broadcasting Corp. correspondent Brian Barron reported from 
Beijing that he and his film crew had been detained for three hours by Chinese 
troops and were forbidden to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
He said the crew, which had been filming clandestinely from their car because 
of martial-law restrictions, were marched to a martial-law center where their 
videotapes were confiscated and their passports briefly taken away. 
</P>
<P>
"They suggested that a number of us should write self-criticisms of our 
mistakes, which I did most eagerly," Barron said. "Then they gave us an 
extremely severe talking-to on what would happen next time and how unpleasant 
the results would be. I am feeling very depressed. They said we cannot leave 
China until they give the authorization."

Two Chinese diplomats who announced Saturday night that they were defecting to 
the United States have not yet decided whether to seek political asylum but 
will be allowed to stay in this country for at least a year, federal 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats, Zhou Liming, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang 
Limin, 25, a staff member, both attached to the Chinese Consulate here, met 
with Immigration and Naturalization Service officials and are staying at an 
undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
The two appeared unannounced Saturday at an outdoor vigil here, attended by 
about 5,000 people, for those killed in military violence against Chinese 
civilians in Beijing's Tian An Men Square on June 4. Both addressed the crowd, 
saying they were defecting because they could no longer support their 
government's actions, then were escorted away by FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
David Ilchert, INS district director, said Monday that the pair had not yet 
decided on their future. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ilchert, Zhou and Zhang can remain in the United States until 
June, 1990, under a special order recently enacted by the U.S. attorney 
general. Under the order, Chinese nationals who have been in this country since 
June, 1989, can stay here for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ilchert said the order was enacted because Chinese nationals might fear 
returning home due to the recent political turmoil in China. "All you have to 
do in essence is say, 'I don't want to go home at this time,' " Ilchert said. 
"It provides a cooling-off period until that situation can be analyzed." 
</P>
<P>
If the two decide to seek political asylum, they must then prove that they 
would be persecuted based on their race, nationality, religion or membership in 
a political group, Ilchert said. He also said that they could remain in the 
United States under a special provision of the Immigration Act that permits 
foreign government officials to stay if they can show compelling reasons why 
they should not return home. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Chinese Consulate issued a brief statement Monday calling the 
pair's actions "utterly unjustifiable" and said they will contact U.S. 
officials regarding the case. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats, who have been in this country for about two years, said in a 
report published in Monday's issue of the San Francisco-based Chinese Times 
that they had planned to defect for days because they felt "deep pain and 
sadness" over the Beijing massacre. 
</P>
<P>
According to an English translation of the article, Zhou said he always 
supported the cause of the pro-democracy demonstrators in his heart but kept 
his views secret because "there were too many eyes and too many ears within the 
consulate." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said they heard about plans for the San Francisco vigil from 
protesters gathered in front of the consulate and decided to sneak out after 
dinner Saturday night, when consulate security was not as heavy as usual. The 
two walked to City Hall, approached organizers of the candlelight vigil and 
showed them their business cards. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech to the crowd, Zhou and Zhang said they could no longer 
support their government's actions or lie to their people.

QUAYLE ASSAILS CUBA, PANAMA AND NICARAGUA

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle sharply denounced "the axis of Cuba, Nicaragua and 
Panama" on Monday, warning that the three nations pose a threat to the region's 
struggling economies. 
</P>
<P>
Using particularly blunt language, the vice president expressed skepticism 
about elections that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's government has 
promised to hold next February, saying they could be a "sham." He said he will 
tell Contra military commanders that their return to Nicaragua to take part in 
the political process is an option available to them, but he would give them no 
recommendations on what course to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at the past track record of Ortega. It hasn't been a good 
one," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president visited Guatemala and Honduras on Monday, the first stops on 
a three-day tour of Central America. The trip is his second to the region as he 
assumes a leading role in the Bush Administration's low-visibility effort to 
make progress in an area that vexed the Reagan Administration for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
At stops in Guatemala and Honduras, Quayle met with elected civilian Presidents 
Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo and Jose Azcona Hoyo, who are struggling to maintain 
fledgling democracies. He stressed the need to adhere to the course of open 
political systems, while seeking to drum up regional pressure against Nicaragua 
and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Time for Dictators' 
</P>
<P>
"The hemisphere no longer has time for dictators of any stripe," he said, 
lumping Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega and the Marxist leaders of Cuba 
and Nicaragua together. "The axis of Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama threatens peace 
and democracy in this hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
"That axis would work very much to the economic decline of this region," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bush Administration stymied in its ongoing effort to remove military 
strongman Noriega from power, Quayle met for 90 minutes late Sunday evening 
upon his arrival in Guatemala City with Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario 
Palencia. Palencia and the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Trinidad-Tobago are 
members of a special mission of the Organization of American States that is 
trying to negotiate a resolution to the Panamanian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force Two as he flew Sunday evening from 
Washington to Guatemala, the vice president said he will tell the Contra 
military commanders this morning that if they are "comfortable" with the idea 
of abandoning their camps in Honduras and returning to Nicaragua, they will be 
encouraged to follow such a course. But he added: "I don't have to tell them 
what Danny Ortega's track record is." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's meeting with the Contra figures this morning at the U.S. Embassy here 
will be the first such conference between a senior U.S. official and the field 
commanders who have been fighting the now-stalled guerrilla war against the 
Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would tell the Contra field commanders if they ask whether a 
resumption of the war is one of their options, Quayle said, "I would say that 
is currently not policy."

STYMIED BY AFGHAN REGIME, REBELS PLAN TO ALTER TACTICS

Anti-government rebels in Afghanistan have lost the "psychological initiative" 
to the Marxist regime in Kabul but hope to regain the edge in coming weeks 
through a military and political offensive intended to force the government to 
defend far more of the nation's rugged countryside, a senior U.S. official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The official, a top Administration strategist on Afghanistan, said the 
U.S.-backed moujahedeen insurgents were "duped" into mounting major -- and so 
far unsuccessful -- sieges of the government-held cities of Jalalabad and 
Kandahar because city commanders sent word that they were ready to surrender 
and defect but, instead, staged effective defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they changed their minds or it was careful misinformation, we can't 
tell," the official, speaking on condition that he not be named, told a small 
group of reporters. "I assume it was the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"The psychological initiative is now with the regime in Kabul," the official 
said. "I suspect that will change in the weeks ahead." 
</P>
<P>
He explained that much of the mountainous country was covered in deep snow for 
most of the spring, making it impossible for the moujahedeen to broaden the 
battle beyond a few important cities. The snow is now mostly gone and probably 
will not return until October, clearing the way for rebel attacks intended to 
"spread the resources of the regime quite thin." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official said, the moujahedeen have resolved some of the 
debilitating internal political conflicts that earlier hobbled military action 
with poor distribution of arms and failure of coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past 10 years, they have believed that belief in Allah and a 
willingness to fight were enough," the official said. "The lesson of Jalalabad 
is they need to be much better coordinated. They have to play a much shrewder 
political game." 
</P>
<P>
The official said the moujahedeen have, in the last few weeks, corrected their 
arms supply problems, sending available weapons to the units that need them 
most. In the past, he said, the arms were distributed primarily on the basis of 
internal political considerations, often resulting in weapons going to units 
that were not actively engaged in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops on Feb. 15, many U.S. 
officials gleefully predicted that the government of President Najibullah would 
collapse in a matter of weeks. The senior official said that U.S. intelligence 
estimates were never that optimistic, although he said the regime was expected 
to last no more than six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The official said it now appears that the government may hold out for a year or 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to see the Afghan war end in a negotiated, political 
settlement, the official said. But he said such a settlement is nowhere in 
sight because the moujahedeen refuse to consider a compromise that would assign 
any sort of role to Najibullah in a future government. 
</P>
<P>
The political solution, therefore, must await the removal of the president from 
the scene -- either by total military defeat, coup d'etat or resignation. The 
official conceded that, after the successful defense of Jalalabad and Kandahar, 
Najibullah can be expected to remain a factor for some time.

RANCHER DENIED AN APPEAL FOR KILLING SHEEP-EATING GRIZZLY

Does a citizen have a constitutional right to defend his property against 
grizzly bears? 
</P>
<P>
Richard Christy, a Montana sheep rancher, thought so. The Supreme Court, 
apparently, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Christy's sheep were being picked off, one or two per night, by 
grizzly bears that lived in the neighboring Glacier National Park. After losing 
27 sheep, at a cost of more than $1,200, Christy decided to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
One July evening, he spotted a grizzly ready to pounce on his herd. Christy 
picked up his rifle, fired two shots and killed the bear. 
</P>
<P>
For that, the government fined him $3,000, because the grizzly is a threatened 
species protected under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
Christy, believing his livelihood was threatened, filed suit against the 
government. In court, he argued that he had a constitutional right to protect 
his property from marauding intruders. 
</P>
<P>
His suit was tossed out of court without a trial. A federal judge in Montana, 
as well as the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers the entire West, 
ruled that there is no such constitutional right. Under the 5th and 14th 
amendments, the government cannot "deprive" a person of "property without due 
process of law," but the judges noted that it was not the the government, but 
the grizzlies that were depriving Christy of his sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the rancher appealed to the Supreme Court, but the justices on 
Monday dismissed without comment the case of Christy vs. U.S. Dept. of 
Interior, 88-1461. Only Justice Byron R. White voted to hear the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The rancher's case was argued on constitutional rights, so the court's decision 
had no effect on local trespassing laws or other measures that protect private 
property.

A sightseeing plane that vanished between the islands of Hawaii and Maui with 
11 people aboard may have sent out an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather 
prevented rescuers from searching for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an emergency signal coming from a valley, and we think it could be the 
plane," said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler. "But the weather's so bad 
helicopters can't go in, and otherwise it's about a 10-hour hike." 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's signal from the 
remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is on the northwest end and 
within the flight path of the missing Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane, Spangler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane disappeared Sunday on what was to have been an hourlong flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting all our information together and seeing if the weather will let 
up," Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds persisted in the area Monday.

ACTIVISTS SAY INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL LIMITS ARE 'WEAKEST' PART OF CLEAN AIR 
PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air pollution experts and environmental groups Monday called President Bush's 
plan for reducing emissions of life-threatening industrial chemicals "the 
weakest" part of his environmental package, complaining it will take too long 
to implement and may allow many dangerous toxins to go unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
Industry groups, however, cautiously praised the plan, saying it will give them 
a say in creating new regulations and will give more flexibility to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"(The plan) appears to have a lot of flexibility in it, and that's good but we 
still don't know how a lot of these pieces fit together," said Theresa Pugh, a 
director of the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan is designed to reduce industrial emissions that now are blamed for 
as many as 3,000 deaths and an unknown number of birth defects and health 
problems each year. At least 2.7 billion pounds of toxic chemicals, many of 
them carcinogens, are released into the nation's environment each year by 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Current Law 
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, these life-threatening poisons are regulated according 
to their impact on public health. But the EPA has only restricted seven of 225 
dangerous chemicals since Congress ordered them to take action in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Abramowitz, program director for the Santa Monica-based Coalition for 
Clean Air, said Bush's plan is "weak" but nevertheless far superior to the 
current program. 
</P>
<P>
"It could result in a much more aggressive federal program to control air 
toxics," he said. "The current program is not working at all. I am hoping the 
proposed weak requirements on air toxics will be strengthened, but any 
enhancement is better than the experience we have had in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan is expected to reduce releases of such chemicals substantially. It 
calls for creating regulations based on the best available emissions-cutting 
technology. Under the plan, the EPA would develop regulations for 10 kinds of 
industries within two years, 25% of all polluting industry within four years, 
50% within seven years and the rest, if necessary, within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Once these regulations went into effect, the EPA would then decide whether the 
state-of-art technology was working to protect public health. The agency 
administrator could decide to set additional standards if the public still was 
being exposed to an "unreasonable risk." But the administrator would have to 
take into account the cost to industry of any new regulations before issuing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Same Wave Length' 
</P>
<P>
"'Most industry is in favor of a technology approach, so at least in general 
principle, we are on the same wave length," said Ronald Hamm, a spokesman for 
an industry coalition that lobbied the Bush Administration on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the fact that the EPA administrator would have rule-making discretion, 
if there is a substance not deemed worthy of control because it is 
technologically not feasible or because the health considerations are not 
significant," said Pugh of the Washington-based manufacturers' association. The 
regulatory process, she said, will give industry, along with environmental 
groups, the opportunity to participate. 
</P>
<P>
But William Becker, executive director of two national organizations that 
represent state and local air pollution control officials, said Bush's plan 
could leave many pollutants uncontrolled until the year 2015. Devising, 
implementing, reviewing and then tightening the regulations may take that much 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker also objected to the provision that gives the EPA discretion in deciding 
whether less-dangerous polluters should be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows the EPA not to regulate all sources that emit air toxics," he said. 
"Instead, it imposes a schedule for regulating 50% of all the facilities and 
then provides EPA with discretion in decisions not to regulate the rest . . . 
If the agency decided the bottom 50% of (industrial) source categories were not 
necessary, the agency could decide not to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Becker said, there is no standard for determining what is an 
"intolerable risk." 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the public and industry to know the benchmark against 
which they are being measured," he said. "There is just no benchmark, no 
criterion, to judge what is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
An "intolerable risk," for instance, could be defined as enough pollution to 
cause more than one person in a million to get cancer after living near a plant 
for 70 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hattoy, Southern California director of the Sierra Club, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, Hattoy said, want regulations that will reduce hazardous 
emissions by 90%. Environmentalists had also hoped Bush's plan would create a 
chemical safety board to investigate industrial accidents in which toxins were 
released into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
By requiring the EPA to consider the cost before tightening regulations to 
prevent an intolerable risk, Hattoy said the plan was "a capitulation to 
industry's demands."

After unveiling his clean air plan in Washington, President Bush flew here to 
tour the site of naturally sparked forest fires that charred nearly a million 
acres of parkland last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Wyoming in mid-afternoon and took a 20-minute helicopter ride 
over some of the area scarred by the fires. On the ground, the President toured 
the Fountain Flats burn area and inspected charred tree trunks and tiny green 
pine sprouts growing in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibility of recovery from the fires, Bush told 
reporters: "We've got a very, very impressive group of men and women working on 
it. . . . They've given a very optimistic assessment." 
</P>

Wearing a leather jacket, forest-green slacks and a blue baseball cap, Bush was

fishing trip on Jackson Lake in the shadow of the snow-capped Grand Tetons.

The radio-commanded firing of an onboard motor shifted a new navigation 
satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles above the Earth, the Air 
Force reported. The Navstar satellite was launched from Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida on Saturday into a preliminary elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 
to 11,000 miles high. The new satellite is the second advanced model Navstar to 
be launched. It is designed to tell U.S. and allied military forces where they 
are within 50 feet anywhere in the world. Ground stations tracked the satellite 
for nearly two days to determine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal to 
start the motor.

Former Rep. John W. Jenrette Jr. (D-S.C.), on probation from bribery and 
conspiracy convictions in the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970s, was found guilty for 
the second time of shoplifting shoes and clothes from a suburban Washington 
department store. A Circuit Court jury in Fairfax, Va., found Jenrette guilty 
of petty larceny through switching price tags at Marshall's discount department 
store in Tyson's Corner on Dec. 7. The jury recommended a $1,000 fine and six 
months in jail for each of the two misdemeanor charges. But the fact that 
Jenrette was on probation could greatly lengthen that term. Sentencing was set 
for Aug. 18. Jenrette had been found guilty on both charges by Fairfax County 
Circuit Judge Donald B. McDonough on Feb. 23. He appealed that verdict in an 
attempt to bring his case before a jury.

The Justice Department said for the first time that Rep. William H. Gray III 
(D-Pa.) is not the target of a criminal investigation. The statement backed up 
what Gray and his lawyer said FBI agents have told them ever since word leaked 
out last month that two agents had visited Gray. Gray and two others are 
seeking to become House majority whip. Government sources earlier said the 
department had opened a preliminary investigation into whether Gray had a 
"no-show" employee. Gray from the outset said he knew of none, and staff 
members have said since that they had found no evidence of one.

The United Nations began one of its most ambitious repatriation operations, 
bringing hundreds of Namibian exiles home to participate in the territory's 
independence process. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees sought to 
repatriate more than 1,300 refugees on 11 flights on the first day, but several 
flights were canceled, allowing only about 700 to return. The United Nations 
wants to bring back 1,000 refugees a day -- it estimates there are about 40,000 
in camps in neighboring countries -- for the next six weeks under the 
independence plan for Africa's last colony, ruled by South Africa for 74 years.

DESTRUCTIVE STORMS HIT TEXAS, OKLAHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fierce thunderstorms raked northern Texas and Oklahoma, uprooting trees and 
knocking down power lines with winds of up to 76 m.p.h. The storms, born in 
humid and unstable air ahead of a cold front, rumbled toward the lower 
Mississippi Valley, prompting forecasters to post a tornado watch for much of 
Arkansas. Early in the day, wind gusts were clocked at 76 m.p.h. at Wichita 
Falls, Tex., 62 m.p.h. at Tulsa, Okla., and 60 m.p.h. in Oklahoma City, the 
National Weather Service said. Trees were felled by 60-m.p.h. winds in Rogers 
County, Okla., and winds tore down power lines at Sentinel, Okla. Hail ranging 
in size from dimes to half dollars pelted towns in Oklahoma, including 
Glenpool, Catoosa, Tiawah and Oklahoma City. More than half an inch of rain hit 
Abilene, Tex., in 90 minutes, officials said.

A former Cal State Chico football player was sentenced to death for the torture 
murders of a couple during a 1987 robbery. Steven Crittenden, 21, had been 
convicted by a jury in Auburn of murdering Dr. William Chiappella, 68, and his 
wife, Katherine, 67, who were bound and gagged, then stabbed and beaten in 
their Chico home. Placer County Superior Court Judge James Garbolino accepted 
the jury's recommendation that Crittenden be put to death, despite defense 
attorney Don Blake's contention that only one person had received the death 
penalty in six neighboring counties in recent years.

Saying it wants to prevent the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, the Bush 
Administration called for stepped-up military aid to the non-Communist forces 
in Cambodia. The United States has been sending about $7 million a year in 
covert aid to a guerrilla coalition headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Robert 
Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee that the increased aid would strengthen Sihanouk's position 
in negotiations next month on a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia as well as 
deter attacks by the Khmer Rouge on his forces.

NASSCO GETS CONTRACT TO FIX VALDEZ'S HULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez, the oil tanker that ran aground off Alaska in March, causing 
the biggest oil spill in U.S. history, will be towed to San Diego next month 
for extensive repairs to its hull, Exxon officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-million repair contract was announced by Exxon Shipping Co. President 
Frank J. Iarossi at a press conference at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding 
Co. yard, where the repairs will be done and where the Valdez was built in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 New Jobs to Be Created 
</P>
<P>
Nassco President Richard Vortmann said the job will take about nine months and 
create 300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Nassco workers are expected to repair an area 700 feet long and 100 feet wide, 
Iarossi said, which will require 3,000 tons of steel, about 10% of the ship's 
total steel weight. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's dimensions were given as 987 feet by 166 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the damage was recorded on videotape, which Exxon officials 
played on two closed- circuit televisions for reporters. Iarossi said a reef 
penetrated the hull as much as 18 feet in some areas. The ship's depth was 
listed as 88 feet, and Iarossi said one area had a hole about 20 feet by 15 
feet, "large enough to drive a trailer truck through." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the environmental damage caused when the ship spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil after striking the reef -- polluting about 730 miles of 
shoreline in pristine Prince William Sound -- Iarossi went to unusual lengths 
to offer assurances that the Valdez is now "environmentally safe." 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi began the press conference by saying: "We at Exxon are truly sorry for 
the circumstances that led to today's announcement." 
</P>
<P>
He said both the outside and inside of the ship have been cleaned and all 
remaining oil removed from the tanks, clearing the way for the ship to be towed 
to Nassco. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past two months, we have been very active in clearing the oil residue 
from the tanks and exterior of the vessel," said Iarossi, adding that the Coast 
Guard has inspected the ship and certified that there is no oil in the tanks. 
"Believe me, the last thing we want is more embarrassment or environmental 
impact from this vessel." 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Bill Ball, a Coast Guard spokesman in Valdez, said the ship's 
tanks "are fairly clean" and added that Coast Guard officials are reviewing 
Exxon's request for a permit to tow the vessel to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Towing Permit Still Lacking 
</P>
<P>
"We have not approved a permit for the vessel to proceed just yet," Ball said. 
"We're concerned that there is a safe transit with no chance for pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they expect to get towing approval later this month, and 
it will take four tugs about 20 days to tow the Valdez 2,500 miles. The tugs 
will follow a course that will keep the Valdez at least 100 miles offshore, 
Iarossi said. The Valdez will not fire its engines during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oregon Port Was First Choice 
</P>
<P>
Portland, Ore., was Exxon's first choice for a repair site. But company 
officials backed away in early April, when Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt and 
managers of the Port of Portland expressed concern that the Valdez would still 
be leaking oil when it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi insisted Monday that the reluctance shown by Goldschmidt and Portland 
port officials to have the repairs done there played no part in awarding the 
contract to Nassco. 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi said the Valdez will carry about 7.3 million gallons of seawater for 
ballast during the trip and contain 7 gallons of oil residue, or about 1 part 
of oil per million parts of water. In fact, Iarossi said, the inside of the 
tanks is so clean that an abundance of sea life, including fish, has sprung up. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jay Powell of the San Diego-based Environmental Health Coalition, said 
his group is not convinced of the Valdez's environmental safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Questions Raised 
</P>
<P>
"It begs the question why they are not going into Portland, when certain 
conditions were attached. Are those same conditions being attached here?" 
Powell asked. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Unified Port District officials could not be reached for comment late 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Federal pollution laws allow the discharge of oil pollutants equivalent to 10 
parts per million, Iarossi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go to extreme lengths to see that no water (from the ballast 
tanks) is discharged into San Diego Harbor," he said, adding that water from 
the Valdez will be pumped into other Exxon ships and taken away when the vessel 
is docked. 
</P>
<P>
Nassco, a shipbuilding institution in San Diego for 83 years, became 
employee-owned earlier this year. The Valdez contract came "at a very 
propitious time for us," said Vortmann, its president. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez and its sister ship, the Exxon Long Beach, were the last two oil 
tankers built in the United States, and both were built at Nassco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Name Considered 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi said Exxon officials are considering renaming the Valdez when the 
repairs are finished. He said company officials "are concerned about the 
feelings of the crew" assigned to a ship that has been linked to a drunken 
captain and an oil spill that is still making news, almost three months after 
it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hazelwood, 42, who was captain of the Valdez, has been charged with 
being drunk at the time of the accident and is facing criminal charges in the 
massive spill.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY ORDERED FOR PUBLIC GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has agreed to spend up to $9,000 to have 
an independent consultant analyze the economic feasibility of a public golf 
course in the southwest portion of the city near City Hall and the old 
Marineland site. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been reviewing the possibility of developing a public golf course 
in conjunction with the proposed resort development at Long Point -- the site 
of the defunct Marineland -- and a proposed residential development along the 
bluffs north of Point Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
The developers of both sites have employed a golf course architect to design 
and engineer the course. The council will review the feasibility report in 
conjunction with a presentation by the developers of the preliminary golf 
course design.

SILBERMAN TRIAL RULED 'COMPLEX,' PUT OFF UNTIL 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge said Monday that he will declare the money-laundering charges 
against San Diego businessman Richard T. Silberman and three other men a 
"complex case," which means that the defendants probably will not stand trial 
until sometime next year, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving signed a protective order 
prohibiting attorneys on both sides of the complicated case from publicly 
discussing the evidence as the lawyers begin the laborious process of trading 
and digesting thousands of pages of documents relating to the criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's actions came in a brief court hearing in which Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Charles Gorder said there are voluminous evidentiary materials in the case, 
including 6,000 pages of affidavits, wiretap applications, court orders and 
other documents, along with 1,000 cassette tapes from the telephone wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reasonable to think it would take a couple of months to digest all that," 
he told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Time to Review 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, attorneys for defendants Silberman, Chris Petti, Darryl Nakatsuka and 
Jack Norman Myers indicated to the judge that they would need until 
mid-September to review the materials. They also requested hearings on ensuing 
court motions for November, which probably would put a jury trial well into 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing their concerns, the judge asked Gorder to draw up an order 
declaring the matter a complex case, to obtain the signatures of the defense 
attorneys, and then submit the order to his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'll submit it to the court, then I'll be happy to sign it," Irving said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the order is filed, the legal requirement for a speedy trial within 71 
days of the indictment will be waived, and attorneys for both sides will be 
granted more time to prepare for the case. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge also made it clear that he does not want the case to drag on 
indefinitely. "I want to get this case started as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge signed the protective order on the request of attorneys for both 
sides, who said it was a routine precaution in high-visibility, complicated 
cases. They said it will mean that neither side can leak crucial evidence to 
the press and that evidence will only become public as is filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are charged with laundering funds represented to them as 
proceeds from Colombian narcotics sales but actually provided by an undercover 
agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who was a close aide to former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 
is married to Susan Golding, a member of the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty. They all remain free on bail, 
except for Petti, whose probation on an earlier bookmaking case was revoked 
after his indictment in the money-laundering case.

<P>
Three grocery chains have settled false-advertising cases brought jointly by 
the San Diego city attorney's office and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office about ads offering "unlimited double coupons." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement reached Friday stipulates that the grocery store companies, 
without admitting any wrongdoing, are permanently barred from using the word 
"unlimited" in advertisements or store signs that refer to doubling the face 
value of manufacturers' coupons when that service is actually limited, deputy 
City Atty. Tricia C. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement calls for penalties of $32,650 against Ralph's Grocery Company, 
$32,500 against Alpha Beta Company, and $32,000 against Safeway Stores, Johnson 
said. The settlement injunction applies to advertisements by the companies 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The cases resulted from a complaint filed with the San Diego city attorney's 
consumer-fraud unit last June. Several limitations to the "unlimited double 
coupon" promotions existed, Johnson said, including the number, type and value 
of the coupons the stores would double. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County became involved because the ads were running throughout 
Southern California.

SCHOLARS SEE CHINA EVENTS TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge history professor Ron Davis said that after watching first 
hand thousands of Chinese demonstrators risk their lives in the embattled 
country's pro-democracy struggle, he felt torn between his family's pleas that 
he return home and his desire as a scholar to remain. 
</P>
<P>
But what began as an exciting, eyewitness look at a revolution had turned into 
a nightmarish Alice-in-Wonderland adventure. Overnight, former supporters of 
the Chinese student demonstrators turned on them, calling them criminals and 
then blaming foreigners -- such as Davis -- for the violence that has shaken 
the embattled country. 
</P>
<P>
So Davis said he chose his family ahead of his profession. 
</P>
<P>
"It was history, but my family was worried to death," said Davis, who flew back 
to Los Angeles from China with six CSUN colleagues Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrived May 30 
</P>
<P>
The six professors and a program administrator cut short their planned stay in 
the Chinese city of Xian, leaving the country at the request of CSUN President 
James Cleary. The group arrived in China on May 30 and was scheduled to stay 
until June 20. 
</P>
<P>
The university is still trying to find one student in an academic exchange 
program who has not been heard from since the trouble in China started, CSUN 
spokeswoman Gloria Welles said. One CSUN student remains in hiding in Beijing 
with the family of a Chinese friend; another has been located in an 
unidentified Chinese city, and four others have decided to stay in Xian, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The professors, all from the school's department of social and behavioral 
sciences, were scheduled to give talks at the Foreign Language Institute in 
Xian to a conference titled "Understanding America." 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be an exercise in learning about China," said Ralph Vicero, 
associate dean and head of CSUN's faculty delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Vicero said members of the CSUN group became fearful after hearing rumors that 
the Chinese army was preparing to enter Xian, about 600 miles south of Beijing. 
But those fears failed to prevent the group from venturing into the city from 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visited Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
Early last week, several of the group members told the driver of a van who was 
supposed to take them on a tour of the countryside to instead drive them to the 
city's square. The driver took the group past blockades to where 20,000 
students were demonstrating, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The chanting, speeches and fervor of the Chinese students reminded him of 
American students protesting the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"But students protesting the Vietnam War risked maybe a year in jail," said 
Davis, who began teaching at CSUN in 1970 at the height of the school's 
anti-war movement. "The Chinese students knew they were asking for something 
that could jeopardize their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The group of Americans was at first approached frequently by Chinese, Davis 
said. "They would say, 'You've got to tell the world about us,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the university where the group stayed gathered around bulletin 
boards in front of the main administration building and read copies of Hong 
Kong newspaper articles posted there, Vicero said. Voice of America broadcasts 
were played at full volume out of dorm windows, and students angrily denounced 
the killing of Beijing protesters. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis and Vicero said they noticed a dramatic change in attitude among 
students, Chinese citizens and officials by the end of last week, after 
Communist Party officials seemed to regain control of their troubled country. 
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese at the university who had earlier praised the Beijing students 
now call them "hooligans and criminals," Davis said. Loudspeakers on Thursday 
suddenly blared messages that urged students to confess to participating in the 
demonstrations and to turn in other students who were also involved, Vicero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"By Friday, it had become very tense," Vicero said. 
</P>
<P>
The group that day witnessed about 100 Chinese students, dressed in black, 
marching solemnly down one street and carrying a large banner that said: "Shoot 
us, we are here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rapid Change 
</P>
<P>
The overnight rejection of the pro-democracy demonstrators by many Chinese was 
especially chilling, Davis said. The killing of students in Beijing, which had 
been referred to in conversation as a massacre, suddenly was called an 
"incident," he said. Then people started saying that no students were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"They started blaming 'outside agitators,' and then people started asking us, 
'Why are you here?' " Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after several days of unsuccessful attempts to leave the country, the 
group booked space on a flight home via Hong Kong. The flight took more than 20 
hours. Vicero was weary from jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "I wouldn't have missed it for the world."

REFLECTIONS: 'IF YOU WERE IN TROUBLE, PEOPLE GOING BY WOULD STOP AND HELP YOU 
OUT.'

During a 35-year-career as an aeronautical engineer, Andrew (A.J.) Kubica 
worked on everything from the X-1 to the space shuttle. He received an award 
from NASA for work on reaction controls for the Mercury program. At home he's 
best known as mechanic for the family cars and rescuer of motorists in 
distress. Kubica and his wife, Betty, live in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The other day I'm going down to get some gas for my wagon, and just as I pulled 
down the freeway off-ramp, I saw this car with a hood up. It was in a place 
where it was a little dangerous because people come off the freeway pretty 
fast. You could have had an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Then I saw this woman trying to go across the street and I just hollered out, 
"Hey, is that your car?" And she said, "Yes." I says, "What's the problem?" And 
she said, "It got awful hot." 
</P>
<P>
I was thinking about pushing her. But then I says the heck with that, I got the 
rope in there, I'll just pull her out of there. All I wanted to do was get her 
out of that predicament and take it down to this neighborhood garage. She said, 
"I can't drive that thing without power steering." 
</P>
<P>
I says, "You just drive mine, and I'll drive yours." She says, "But I don't 
know how to tow a car." "Honey," I says, "you're gonna learn real fast. I've 
raised five daughters, and if they can tow, you can tow. Just back it up a 
little bit, and I'll hook on to you." Then I says, "Whatever you do, just drive 
carefully. If you come to that red light, make sure we slow down so you go 
through it on the green." She did that perfectly, and she just pulled right 
into the garage, just like a pro, and I pulled right up behind her. 
</P>
<P>
I always have a tow rope in the back end of my car, and chains and shovel and 
water. And I have a couple cans of oil, some transmission fluid, some hose 
clamps and belts and some tools. 
</P>
<P>
If somebody's broken down, I'll try to stop. They're awful thankful, just like 
when they help me I'm thankful. 
</P>
<P>
Back in '53, we had just gotten married, and we're going through high country, 
Montana or Wyoming. I was pulling a small trailer with our wedding gifts and 
things. I was up around 10,000 feet, and the doggone car quit on me. This guy 
driving a Volkswagen bug sees me there in trouble. He just whips that little 
Volkswagen right around and the next thing I know, he was hooked to me. He 
snaked me up over the top of that mountain. I didn't think he could do anything 
with that little bug, but he did. I was going to pay him, but he wouldn't hear 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, because of the freeways, whenever I see somebody in trouble, 
usually all I'm able to do is call up the CHP and say there's somebody 
disabled, would you send a tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first times that I ever stopped to help anyone, I had my cousin from 
New York City with me. She was up visiting us on the farm in the Adirondacks. 
We were driving along, and I looked over and there was this car off the road. 
The young fellow was obviously stuck in some soft sand. I just pulled over and 
threw a rope out and yanked him out. It took me all of about a minute to pull 
him out of that sand, and he was grateful for it. My cousin couldn't understand 
why I had stopped. She was from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't unusual where I came from. If you were born and raised in that 
country, it didn't matter who the party was. If you were in trouble, people 
going by would stop and help you out. It was their way of life. I owe an awful 
lot to my parents for having brought me up in that frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
I remember going to Mexico one time, and this lady pulled off on the side of 
the road, and her car was hot. I walked back there with a couple gallons of 
water and put it in her car after it cooled down. That's all she needed. Never 
saw her before, never see her again, but that's all right. I've had them do the 
same thing for me, see. Life is a precious thing, and people are very 
interesting. I find most of the people, they're fantastic people. They're just 
trying to get along. Sometimes they run into trouble.

DYING MAN IDENTIFIED DEFENDANT, WITNESS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A witness testified in Van Nuys Superior Court on Monday that the victim of an 
execution-style murder identified his attacker before he died. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Mendez Herrera, 32, testified that Manuel Abreu told her that "Danny did 
it" moments before he died from a stab wound to the chest. Herrera said she 
knew "Danny" to be Bertulfo Loaiza, 32. 
</P>
<P>
Loaiza is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in connection with the 
Aug. 13, 1987, killings of Abreu, 32, and Javier Restropo, 26. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were stabbed in the chest. Restropo was also shot in the face at close 
range. Police said the victims, who had been handcuffed and gagged, were killed 
because they owed Loaiza money for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, former manager of the apartment complex where the killings occurred, 
testified Monday that she saw Loaiza before and after the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said she saw Loaiza and two other men trying to push open the door to 
the victims' apartment the night of the incident. "I thought they were 
playing," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, she heard two shots, ran to her bathroom window and saw 
Loaiza jump into a white Camaro and drive away, Herrera said. The other two 
men, whom she could not identify, fled on foot, Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
As she called police, a blood-soaked Abreu appeared at her door, Herrera 
testified. She said Abreu's last words were, "It was Danny. Danny did it." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Mark Overland suggested in his opening statement to the jury 
that Herrera is not a credible witness because she did not tell police that she 
knew who the killer was until months after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera testified that she initially did not tell police everything she knew 
because she feared for her life. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Loaiza, a Colombian national, could be sentenced to life in 
prison without the possibility of parole, authorities said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLS HIMSELF ON POLICE STATION'S STEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Reseda man, despondent over losing his job, walked nearly a mile from his 
home to a Los Angeles police station Monday and fatally shot himself on the 
building's front steps, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Front desk officers at the West Valley Division station in the 19000 block of 
Vanowen Avenue heard the shot and saw the man drop to the pavement outside the 
glass front doors about 2 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers ducked to safety, thinking that someone was shooting at the 
station, but later determined that Alan Matta, 21, had shot himself with a 
rifle. He was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he died about 
an hour later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was under investigation, but police said it appeared that the man 
became despondent and left the house he shared with his mother and stepfather.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 GET PRISON TERMS IN 'NO DOPE' DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of what authorities described as a major San Fernando Valley 
cocaine ring were each sentenced Monday to three years in prison for dealing 
large amounts of narcotics even though police found no drugs when they 
investigated the ring last year. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "no dope" drug conspiracy case was the first of its kind in Los 
Angeles County, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo J. Aguilera, 35, of Tarzana and Galo P. Iturralde, 28, of Granada Hills 
are each expected to serve about two years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn 
McNary. Haripal Singh Sagoo, 24, of Granada Hills was sentenced to five years 
probation, McNary said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea agreement last month, Aguilera and Iturralde each pleaded 
guilty to one count of conspiracy to transport cocaine. Sagoo pleaded guilty to 
a felony money-laundering charge. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank police and federal agents last spring linked the three to a narcotics 
transaction involving a 332-pound shipment of cocaine valued at $2 million. But 
when police searched several homes and businesses from which the ring allegedly 
operated, they found only traces -- too small to use as evidence -- of illegal 
drugs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal forfeiture laws, the Burbank Police Department may be allowed to 
keep most of about $1.7 million in cash and other property seized in the 
investigation.

CHANG RANKS NO. 6 AFTER FRENCH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Chang, the Southern California teen-ager whose resolve on center court 
helped him become the first U.S. male since 1955 to win the French Open tennis 
championship, moved to sixth in the world in Monday's Assn. of Tennis 
Professionals computer rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, from Placentia, was ranked No. 19 before the French Open, a clay-court 
tournament in which the 17-year-old upset No. 1-ranked Ivan Lendl in the fourth 
round last Monday after losing the first two sets. Chang defeated Ronald Agenor 
of Haiti in the quarterfinals, Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union in the 
semifinals and Stefan Edberg of Sweden in Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the upset, Lendl remained No. 1, followed by Boris Becker, who lost to 
Edberg in the semifinals at Paris. Edberg remained third, and Andre Agassi was 
No. 4, the highest rated U.S. player. Mats Wilander of Sweden was No. 5, Thomas 
Muster of Austria No. 7, John McEnroe No. 8, Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland No. 9 
and Tim Mayotte No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Curren and Mayotte had little trouble defeating fellow Americans to reach 
the second round of the Queen's Club grass-court tournament at London. 
</P>
<P>
Mayotte, seeded fourth, overcame Matt Anger, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7), after saving a set 
point in the tiebreaker. Curren, seeded fifth, outlasted doubles specialist 
Robert Seguso, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
While Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver prepared for 
comebacks, 11th-seeded Kathy Rinaldi outlasted Masako Yanagi of Japan, 3-6, 
6-3, 7-5, in a first-round match at a grass-court tournament at Edgbaston, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, ranked second in the world, skipped the clay-court season and will 
begin her Wimbledon preparations this week at Edgbaston, in the suburbs of 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
King, 45, is coming out of a four-year retirement to play doubles and work with 
Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, who has not played singles since April, said she hopes to regain her 
enthusiasm before Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to take a pause after playing for 10 years," she said. "I don't know 
if my appetite is back, but I spent four hours on court practicing on Sunday."

<P>
Jack McCloskey has never come across as a man who stays in the background. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't as the skipper of an LST in the Pacific during World War II when he 
was 19; or as a prep coach, when he tried to strangle a referee in the shower 
after a particularly frustrating basketball game; or as a college coach when he 
kicked the scorer's table at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament so hard 
that he put his foot through it -- and he doesn't these days when he plays 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
But here McCloskey sits, an hour before tipoff of a recent playoff game, 
declining to take credit for the Detroit Pistons having reached the National 
Basketball Assn. Finals for the second consecutive season. The spotlight 
belongs to the on-court personnel, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows about Chuck Daly and all the players," said Laker General 
Manager Jerry West, a former co-worker. "But believe me, Jack has had a big or 
bigger impact." 
</P>
<P>
In his 10 years as general manager, McCloskey has built the Pistons from a 
30-52 team in 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
Daly has been coach for the last five seasons, during which time Detroit has 
never won fewer than 46 games. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey has traded for Vinnie Johnson, giving up Greg Kelser; Bill Laimbeer, 
for Phil Hubbard, Paul Mokeski and two 1982 draft picks; and Rick Mahorn, for 
Dan Roundfield. He had a hand in drafting Isiah Thomas, Dennis Rodman, John 
Salley and Joe Dumars. His imprint is clear on the team that is a victory away 
from sweeping the Lakers in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
But then, McCloskey has left an imprint everywhere he has been. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Mahanoy City, Pa., the son and grandson of coal miners. His 
father, who died of black-lung disease in 1974, sought to ensure that Jack 
would not work in the shafts. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me down into the mines once," McCloskey said. "He showed me how bad he 
had it. He said he didn't ever want to see me down there again." 
</P>
<P>
He never did. Jack's future was in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, it was baseball. Although 14, he played in a men's league against 
30- and 35-year-olds, and after the war the Philadelphia Athletics signed him 
as a right-handed pitcher. McCloskey spent about 10 days in the majors, never 
getting in a game, before being sent to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched so often in the Carolina League, however, that he hurt his shoulder. 
He never really recovered and his career as a pitcher was over 2 1/2 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were other opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, McCloskey was coaching basketball at Collingswood High School in New 
Jersey, where he was known for his love of the game -- and his temper, which he 
has since learned to control. 
</P>
<P>
After a game against Atlantic City, McCloskey was so upset by some calls during 
the game that he tried to strangle a referee -- a fully clothed coach standing 
under the shower and choking the naked man. People heard the struggle and 
intervened before things went too far. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him bad," McCloskey said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who knows McCloskey speaks of his intensity. Perhaps it's not the 
temper he demonstrated when he was 23, but an extreme distaste for losing. 
Competitive spirit, they call it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't dare play tennis with him," said West, a longtime friend. "He would 
kill me to win." 
</P>
<P>
Too emotional about sports? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been accused of that," said McCloskey, who plays tennis three or four 
times a week and frequently plays in over-60 tournaments. "But a lot of people 
look at competitiveness as someone who is a degenerate as far as winning goes. 
If I lose -- either in coaching or tennis or whatever -- I don't bang my head 
against the wall and worry about it for weeks. I analyze why I lost and what I 
can do better next time." 
</P>
<P>
It's just that sitting there, in his jacket and tie, none of that comes across. 
He smiles a lot and speaks softly. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey likes to say that if he had been born a couple of centuries ago, he 
would have been an explorer. It's a romantic notion, and, at 63, he is still 
full of those. Some have gotten him into a bit of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He once said that World War II was fun. He isn't sorry he said it, but he is 
sorry that people took it the wrong way. It wasn't really fun, but it was 
adventure, it was action, it was camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the service," he said. "Did I like the war? No. But, damn it, it was 
exciting. You become very mature very fast under those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to our coaches when we were standing around the locker room in Boston 
before one of our first games this year, 'This is the same feeling.' Everyone 
was quiet, some people were pacing the floor, and it hit me. What this is like 
is war. This is like waiting for the invasion to start. Obviously, it's not as 
important as a real invasion, but it's that same feeling." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey was 17 when he joined the Navy. By 19 he was a lieutenant and skipper 
of a landing craft for tanks, which probably made him the youngest man in the 
Navy at the time to command a ship. 
</P>
<P>
By 26, he was coaching baseball, basketball and football at the University of 
Pennsylvania, his alma mater. After 10 seasons there, McCloskey spent six years 
coaching basketball at Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The next step was the NBA. After three seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, 
he joined the Lakers in 1976 and spent three years as West's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
And after basketball? 
</P>
<P>
"Someday, I'm going to be the best senior tennis player in the world," said 
McCloskey. "Even if I have to outlive everyone else to do it."

ABDUL-JABBAR GIVING IT HIS BEST SHOT AS ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER COMES TO A CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Is this goodby? 
</P>
<P>
They've already bade farewell to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 28 cities, including 
this one, bestowing upon him everything from A (a Tiffany's sterling silver 
apple, from the New York Knicks) to V (VCR, New Jersey Nets), not to mention 
that big R (Rolls-Royce, his Laker teammates), but those were just rehearsals, 
and happy moments, besides. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, with somewhat less ceremony and a good deal less joy, the Detroit 
Pistons can ring down the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Like, it's 0-4, and the rest of your life starts now. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a good way for the king to go out," Mychal Thompson said. "That's 
almost the way Nixon went out, and Napoleon. That's unfair. Great men like 
Kareem are supposed to go out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's practice, your basic blues-for-the-morning-after workout, might 
already have been his last. He probably has been to 3,000 of those, and will 
retire still looking for the first one he enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"A necessary evil," Abdul-Jabbar said. "That's the only way I can look at it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to review, we have to keep sharp. The whole way they play this game, 
they really wear you out with the road (schedule) and you're always tired. And 
that makes practice a difficult thing to get into. So you're constantly 
fighting your nature to slack off." 
</P>
<P>
And when you're down 3-0, isn't it even harder to drag yourself in? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's hard," he said. "You want to have something positive to focus on, 
and being down 3-0, there's very little to focus on, other than desperation." 
</P>
<P>
Since the series is still formally on, Abdul-Jabbar tolerated the inevitable 
questions politely but without enthusiasm. In other words, it was like most of 
his interviews in the last 10 years, when he began sitting still for interviews 
in the first place 
</P>
<P>
The real shame? It's not so much that his career is ending, since everything 
has to. 
</P>
<P>
The real shame is that Abdul-Jabbar found the public role that was his destiny 
so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Like everybody else, I thought he was aloof and a real sour person to be 
around," Thompson said. "He seemed to be that way because he's so quiet and 
private in public. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's got as good a sense of humor as Robin Williams and he's got the most 
boisterous laugh I've ever heard. He just enjoys life and you don't get to see 
that in public. He looks real quiet and shy but he's really a jokester and a 
personable person to be around." 
</P>
<P>
One more loss and the personable Kareem won't be around anymore. What chance 
does he have of going out with the kind of kick -- 24 points, 13 rebounds -- he 
flourished Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, whatever I have to give, I will bring and give it," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
"This is no time to leave anything at home, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Said Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "God, I hope not. I want to see no more of a 
vintage Kareem." 
</P>
<P>
Was Daly surprised? Protocol says you answer no, but Daly said yes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I was a little surprised he had that much left," Daly said. "But that's 
the pride of the guy. Major league." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's last hurrah wasn't all laughs and gifts, either. There was a 
whisper or two, too. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation after last season that the Lakers offered to buy out 
Abdul-Jabbar's contract. He says that no one ever approached him and that it 
was writers' gossip. 
</P>
<P>
There was more such speculation at midseason, when he was playing with less 
inspiration than usual, before Pat Riley announced the two-week "evaluation 
period" and Abdul-Jabbar responded promptly. 
</P>
<P>
"I never believed that (he was through) and the team never believed that," 
Abdul-Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed the last two years to help the team. They thought I could be a factor 
in us winning, and we won it last year and we got darned close this year. So, I 
think they were right and the skeptics were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
So we're left awaiting his departure and weighing his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think I belong in that category (the top players)," he said. "I'm not 
going to say that I'm the best. I'll let the fans argue about that. But I can 
say, without a hesitation, I've had a great career, and I'm proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Pistons keep guarding him with one man, as they have been, he might just 
send everyone home with something else to remember. That's the marathon element 
of his legacy: After 20 seasons -- four more than anyone else ever lasted -- 
there are still only a few centers who can handle him one on one. 
</P>
<P>
And if Abdul-Jabbar pulls up short of Sunday's performance, he won't have to 
drive home to Bel-Air and rummage around for what he forgot to bring. He lasted 
long enough to say, without a hesitation, "I gave at the office." 
</P>
<P>
So how will it end? 
</P>
<P>
"Things won't change a bit," Thompson said. "Kareem will be the first one in 
the shower, the first one to leave. Before anybody realizes he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
This time they'll realize it, all right.

SCOTT OSTLER: PISTONS HAVE LOOK OF THE CHAMPIONS THEY NEARLY ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers vs. the Detroit Pistons is one sporting spectacle that makes me glad 
I don't own a giant-screen television, where faces are the actual size of the 
carvings on Mt. Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
I like drama, but I don't want to get that up-close and personal with such 
wrenching scenes of pain and suffering. I'm not talking about the Lakers with 
their physical and emotional traumas. I'm referring to the Detroit Pistons and 
their horrified reactions to every foul and infraction whistled against them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only thing that can derail the Pistons would be if a key player 
pulls a major facial muscle after a foul call. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES (API) -- Piston center Bill Laimbeer will miss the rest of the NBA 
Finals after suffering a strained trombonis spumoni, the muscle that connects 
the jawbone to the brain stem. Laimbeer was injured executing a violent 
jaw-drop when he was called for an elbowing foul during the national anthem 
before Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment, Laimbeer said, "Sorry, the doctor warned me not to move my 
jaAAAAAAAWWWWWWWGGGGHHH!!" 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the Pistons invented crying. Red Auerbach invented it 
70 years ago and it caught on faster than the one-handed jump shot. Magic 
Johnson is a master of foul-reaction disaster; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's indignant 
arm-flap is a much-admired classic. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, however, have elevated the foul-take to an art form. It's part of 
the Piston package, which is a blend of boyish charm, eccentricity, enthusiasm, 
exuberance and wanton violence. 
</P>
<P>
I'm impressed with the way the Pistons have taken advantage of the new 
super-close-up camera shots to convey their sense of injustice. Actor friends 
tell me that many professional acting workshops make use of Piston game 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "See that look, students? That's what I mean when I ask for pathos blended 
with irony and despair! Incredible! And that's the Piston ballboy!!" 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer's speciality is the shock take. It is an expression that says: "Say 
what, Your Honor? You're sentencing me to be dipped alive in boiling gerbil 
saliva for a parking ticket???!!!" 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman and Rick Mahorn have perfected the difficult and annoying 
"radiant smile reaction." It is the expression most commonly seen on the face 
of a Miss Universe pageant winner, Stevie Wonder, or a guy walking barefoot on 
really pointy rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the looks, the Piston players hop and saunter about the court, hands 
on hips, waiting for the governor to call. Rodman locks his hands behind his 
head as if he were being arrested for overacting. All this pacing and spinning 
and lurching would make it difficult for TV to zero in on the player faces, 
except that CBS has assigned 37 hand-held mini-cams to shoot nothing but facial 
close-ups after foul calls. 
</P>
<P>
Although entertaining, these close-up shots present an element of danger. 
Remember, our children are watching. Just yesterday I accused my 5-year-old son 
of playing with his Leggo blocks when he was supposed to be getting dressed for 
preschool, and he nailed me with a Bill Laimbeer jaw-drop. 
</P>
<P>
Actually there is a good reason for the Pistons' agony and ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all for Chuck," John Salley explained recently, referring to Piston Coach 
Chuck Daly. "Everything's for Chuck. You've got to make Chuck think you've been 
cheated. If you (give a so-what shrug), he'll think you don't care." 
</P>
<P>
What the players don't realize is that Daly is so busy with his own shock-takes 
that he hardly has time to notice theirs. Daly is a triple-threat coach, 
equally adept at overreacting to referee miscalls, non-calls and his own 
players' bonehead plays. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong, I like Daly and his Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
How can you not enjoy Rodman, the Human Chandelier, who has invented an 
acrobatic version of the slam-dunk. Rodman dunks, then grabs onto the rim and 
dangles for a minute or two, lest the official scorer credit the basket to the 
wrong Piston. 
</P>
<P>
I certainly hope the Lakers don't resort to secretly smearing Super Glue on the 
Piston rim before Game 4, thus causing Rodman to hang aloft for an entire half, 
because that would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Salley is a funny man, off the court anyway. He has a marvelous sense of humor, 
and a penchant for innocently dropping the names of his famed Hollywood 
buddies, such as Eddie (Murphy), Spike (Lee) and Arsenio (Schmidlap) Hall. 
</P>
<P>
You have to love Joe Dumars, who reported late for training camp and missed the 
Pistons' acting lessons. On a team of alleged thugs and hotdogs, Dumars plays 
cleanly and quietly, like a kid trying to earn a merit badge in jump-shooting. 
</P>
<P>
And how about the amazing Vinnie Johnson, who is nicknamed Microwave, not 
because he heats up quickly like a microwave oven, but because he is built like 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The only time Vinnie has been shut out during this series was after Game 2, at 
the team's postgame locker-room buffet. James (Buddha) Edwards hit the table 
first and was sitting at his locker. Between his feet was a paper plate with a 
pile of chicken-wing bones about two feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave looked at the empty chicken bin, then looked at Edwards and his bone 
pile. 
</P>
<P>
"Buddha ate all the wings," Microwave said in dismay. 
</P>
<P>
Buddha, maintaining his serene character, went right on gnawing on the last 
wing. 
</P>
<P>
I had to dash off to make deadline, but I really wanted to hang around and see 
Bill Laimbeer's reaction.

LEONARD-HEARNS, THE SEQUEL, WAS WORTHY OF WHAT CAME BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOFFER, Times Staff Writer

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Examined from a more distant perspective than 1989, this decade will likely 
loom as one of boxing's greatest, and mostly for the intrigue offered by two of 
its most charismatic performers. Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, though 
shadows of the two men who met in that benchmark of boxing events back in 1981, 
only deepened that intrigue Monday night in a draw that was oddly satisfying 
for all its inconclusiveness. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to believe that Hearns, whose loss to Leonard in this same 
desert setting eight years ago has been one of the sport's more remarkable open 
wounds, did not actually beat his longtime tormentor. Though in perilous 
straits often enough, Hearns did provide the only two knockdowns of the fight. 
And the fact that Hearns himself, he of the glass chin, did not wither under 
Leonard's barrages was also impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Yet few were disappointed by the decision, certainly not the fighters 
themselves, who appeared together after the fight, each wearing a grin of 
gratitude. Perhaps in a few days the fighters will feel regret, sense a missed 
opportunity. Hearns might realize how close he came to the redemption that only 
Leonard offered. And Leonard might wonder why he didn't move more, why his 
classic finishing touch was not quite enough to put Hearns away. He might 
wonder if he'll be dogged another eight years by the indomitable Hit Man. 
</P>
<P>
The fight held the fury of youth, if not the talents. The third round, when 
Leonard cracked Hearns a shuddering punch to the top of the head, developed 
into a scarifying stretch with Hearns coming out on top and driving Leonard 
into the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth round recalled the first fight, when Leonard, trailing on points, 
came back in the 14th round to send Hearns sliding along the ropes. Here, too, 
Hearns appeared to be helpless, wobbly, one more right hand away from a 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
There were moments throughout the fight. At times Hearns sneaked his jab into 
Leonard's face at will. Others, Leonard was backing Hearns up. Several times 
Hearns measured Leonard yet could not hurt him. Leonard's jaw, unlike Hearns', 
is famous for its strong stuff. In the ninth, Leonard wobbled Hearns but could 
not put him away. In the 10th, Leonard cut him below the eye. In the 11th, a 
bravura round, when Hearns should have fought with care and did not, it was 
Leonard whose head was sent swinging back and forth in a brutal delivery of 
punches. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12th, the noise reached a magnificent crescendo and then heightened as, 
even within the round, the momentum changed back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was the fighter who met in 1981, of course. Though just 30, Hearns is 
no longer the guy who says lights out with each right hand. And Leonard, 33, 
was neither pretty nor clever in this one. But they did sustain a decade of 
excellence, a decade that started when both were welterweights and continues 
into super-middleweight days, right up to the end, if indeed this is the end. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't like this fight, you can not ignore the spectacles they have 
staged since then. Leonard was a master at creating drama with his various 
retirements and a decade of will-he-won't-he? that, teased by any other, might 
have infuriated the public. And Hearns became mysterious by his defeat, 
vulnerable (he even had other defeats), but a sulking and brooding presence 
waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
There were fights with Hagler and Duran, an amassing of titles and loot and 
recognition. A level of comfort earned by a dangerous and tricky trade. Cynics 
balked at the rematch, saying it came way too late. Yet cynics, in the end, 
allowed it to go on. These two, after all, never disappointed a fan. Leonard 
was spectacular in his comeback against Hagler. Hearns was even more 
spectacular in his loss to Hagler. Whatever happened in this fight, they 
deserved to trade on full careers, on name recognition if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
But as in the past, they delivered. At the end of the fight, it didn't even 
seem necessary that a decision be announced. Hearns smiled goofily through a 
bloody mouthpiece, Leonard smirked in a self-satisfied way. Whatever had 
happened in the ring, was more important than what happened outside it. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who may have worn the grin of a successful jewel thief, admitted that 
Hearns was more than he could handle. "A tough cookie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns, who was surprisingly content with the decision, likewise allowed that, 
"This man hurt me and he didn't know it." And: "He knew I could take him out 
and yet he came back." He did not have it in him to rage against the decision, 
even question it. He somehow found satisfaction in the event, having decided he 
acquitted himself just fine. After all, there had been eight years of 
wondering. 
</P>
<P>
There are any number of moments to remember from the fight. There is all kinds 
of speculation to follow. Will they meet in a third match to finally resolve 
their destiny or, better yet, will they allow their special decade to close 
with a lingering mystery? Who is better? 
</P>
<P>
After the fight the two men sat next to each on a dais, with press and fans and 
family hooting away. Hearns, strangely ebullient, yelled: "Did we fight 
tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
Then, with his old enemy still smiling at his side: "Did we give you what we

NICHOLLS' PATIENCE PAYS OFF WITH CONTRACT FIT FOR KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls thought he was worth a new contract even before the last hockey 
season began, but he decided against pressing his luck with the Kings' front 
office because, for one thing, he wanted the chance to play with Wayne Gretzky 
and didn't like the trade rumors he kept hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Also, and perhaps more important, he thought maybe he could increase his value 
with one more good season. 
</P>
<P>
He was right on both counts. Playing with Gretzky was all he ever thought it 
would be, and as a result, Nicholls set a club record with 70 goals and 
finished with a career-high 150 points. 
</P>
<P>
And Monday, the Kings announced they have signed Nicholls to a multiyear 
contract. He confirmed that the contract runs five years and will be worth, 
bonuses included, almost $750,000 a year. That represents an increase of about 
three times his previous salary. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this puts an end to all the trade talk," Nicholls said. "I think the 
main reason my name always came up was because I wasn't making anything 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls negotiated with the Kings himself, feeling no need for an agent after 
conferring with Gretzky about what other top players were making and what he 
should expect from the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"To do it that way, I had to trust the Kings, I guess, but I do trust them," 
Nicholls said. "Both Bruce (owner Bruce McNall) and Rogie (General Manager 
Vachon) have been good friends over the years. I knew they would have a fair 
offer ready for me." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings also announced the signing of defenseman Tim Watters to a multiyear 
contract, and Mario Gosselin, a goaltender for the Quebec Nordiques who became 
a free agent after last season. They signed Gosselin without compensation to 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Glenn Healy, who won 25 games for the Kings last season, played out 
the last year of his contract and is a free agent. Healy said Monday that he 
has not had a chance to talk to the Kings about a contract for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never have too many goaltenders," McNall said. "(Signing Gosselin) 
doesn't have anything to do with our negotiations with Glenn. We learned during 
the playoffs when both of our goaltenders got sick that you can never have too 
many."

BRAZIL ORDERS STOCK, OPTIONS MARKETS TO CLOSE FOR ONE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brazilian authorities Monday ordered all stock and options markets shut for one 
day to sort out the chaos caused when checks written by a major brokerage house 
bounced. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal of the banks to honor an 11 million new cruzado ($8.8 million) 
check written last week by Lebanese-born Naji Nahas to a brokerage company, Ney 
Carvalho, has plunged stock exchanges into disarray. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio exchange said in a telex late Monday that a total of seven brokerage 
houses had debts at the close of business Thursday, when the Nahas check was 
cashed. 
</P>
<P>
Nahas, educated in Egypt and London but now a Brazilian citizen, was charged by 
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1985 with illegally 
manipulating silver prices in 1979 and 1980 together with the Hunt brothers. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of helping coordinate silver purchases in a bid to corner the 
silver market sparking a five-fold price jump to a record $50 per ounce in 
early 1980. In 1986, Nahas was fined $250,000 by the CFTC for his role in the 
alleged manipulation scheme. 
</P>
<P>
A stock exchange official said that four firms had been reported on Monday 
night to the Central Bank for failing to pay their debts. The central bank 
would decide whether to close them or impose other penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Exchange sources said the debts in the four companies so far reported to the 
central bank totalled around 20 million new cruzados ($16 million). 
</P>
<P>
But the final total of money involved was believed to be higher, perhaps as 
much as 200 million cruzados ($160 million), they said.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: JACOR CHIEF DEFENDS FIRM'S BID FOR MAXWELL 
LABORATORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAYCOR President James Young on Monday described the privately held defense 
contractor's unsuccessful $17-a-share bid for Maxwell Laboratories as 
"particularly attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Young, in a prepared release issued Monday, said that JAYCOR had "firm 
commitment from major financial institutions" for financing needed to complete 
the proposed $44.2-million deal. Young also complained that Maxwell's board has 
rejected JAYCOR's request to at least open negotiations between the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's board of directors on Thursday rejected the uninvited bid, describing 
it as an "unsatisfactory" and "highly conditional" bid that did not benefit the 
company's shareholders. Maxwell Vice President Sean Maloy on Friday said the 
offer conflicted with Maxwell's growth strategy. Maxwell is a high-technology 
company that manufactures products for defense and commercial customers. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts on Friday suggested that JAYCOR's unsuccessful bid would open 
the door for more bids by JAYCOR or other companies. But JAYCOR Vice President 
Vernon Blackman on Monday declined to comment on whether JAYCOR would make a 
higher bid for Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blackman said that JAYCOR "is only interested in a friendly merger. . 
. . We are not interested in a hostile tender offer for Maxwell. We have the 
highest regard for Maxwell management and its key personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Young "did not understand how Maxwell's board could have found the terms and 
conditions of Maxwell's all-cash merger offer 'unsatisfactory' . . . (or) 
'highly conditional' when the opposite was true," according to the release. 
</P>
<P>
JAYCOR is pressing Maxwell's board to open negotiations between the two San 
Diego-based companies, Blackman said. "We obviously (think) that conditions 
would be altered if face-to-face meetings with Maxwell were to occur," Blackman 
said. "We think there's a lot to be gained by merging these two companies . . . 
and we hope conditions would change if the Maxwell board and ourselves could 
start a dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Blackman on Monday defended JAYCOR's $17-a-share bid. "We've done an extensive 
financial analysis of Maxwell, and Maxwell plus JAYCOR, and we feel that $17 is 
a reasonable price," Blackman said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell closed up $.75 on Monday, at $16.75. GREG JOHNSON

2 HOUSEWIVES RAISE A TOAST -- TO THEIR BABY BOTTLE; 
</P>
<P>
ENCINITAS WOMEN STRIKE IT RICH, SELL CHERUBS TO PLAYTEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Encinitas housewives were car-pooling their infants to preschool five years 
ago when the brainstorm hit: why not start a company that sold decorative, 
"fashion" baby bottles instead of the lackluster, polyurethane containers then 
dominating the market? 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Jennifer Richards and Linda Geitner, both now 39, take their idea 
and run with it, they subsequently built a company from scratch called Cherubs 
that revolutionized the baby-feeding industry. Four years after its founding, 
the company booked $8.3 million in 1988 sales. Cherubs now employs 60 in a 
converted Mayfair supermarket on Vulcan Street in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
The partners found their pot of gold last month when they sold their young 
company to Playtex of Stamford, Conn. Richards declined to discuss the sale 
price but sources close to the company said it was in excess of Cherubs' 1988 
sales of $8.3 million. Thus did the former car-poolers Richards and Geitner, 
who together owned 80% of Cherubs' stock, strike it rich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Tardy Ones Get Together 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the two women became friendly after they noticed they were always 
the tardy ones in their car pool at Bethlehem Pre-School, "making the other 
ladies late for their tennis games." Geitner, who was traveling Monday and not 
available for an interview, was an interior designer before quitting to become 
a housewife full time. Richards, a former registered nurse, has four children, 
and Geitner has three. 
</P>
<P>
Their success story is one that involves daring, 80-hour work weeks and making 
huge personal sacrifices: both women are going through divorces and say they 
regret having spent so much time away from their children during their 
formative years. 
</P>
<P>
The Cherubs story is also one that hinges on the good will of other successful 
businesswomen. In an interview Monday, Richards credited the guidance of 
entrepreneur Sylvia Noble as critical to Cherubs' success. Noble is a co-owner 
of No Jo, an Orange County infant bedding company with $30 million in sales 
that has made several lists of fastest-growing U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Secret: 'Just Do It' 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important lesson that Cherubs offers to would-be entrepreneurs 
is not to be intimidated by any barrier. "We found that the secret to business 
is there is no secret. Just do it," said Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Cherubs, for example, would never have succeeded had Richards not been 
audacious enough to knock on doors that impartial observers might have assumed 
would be closed to upstarts such as her. In 1985, Richards approached the 
foundation that owns the Sesame Street label and characters and asked for 
licensing rights. Although the meeting took place just three months after she 
and Geitner had formed their company and before making any sales, they got the 
license and Cherubs was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from baby bottles, Cherubs makes a line of bibs, pacifiers and other 
accessories that are characterized by vivid designs, colors and high-quality 
manufacturing. In addition to Sesame Street, Cherubs licenses National Football 
League and Major League Baseball logo licensing rights and owns 12 proprietary 
designs and logos. 
</P>
<P>
When Cherubs' first line of baby bottles was introduced in 1985, most mothers 
used nondescript plastic or glass bottles with no lettering or colors. But 
Richards and Geitner reasoned that, if gaily colored baby clothing, mobiles and 
furniture could sell, so could bottles. And, if the argument could be made that 
brightly colored 
</P>
<P>
mobiles could stimulate brain development in infants, the same could be said as 
part of a Cherubs sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with just the idea, the two women soon made believers of a group of 
family and friends who in 1985 invested $80,000 in stock to finance the young 
company. The cash enabled them to to finance the production of prototypes and 
appearances at a critical 1985 trade show in Dallas. Cherubs gained credibility 
by placing a full-page, four-color ad in the trade show program at a time when 
Cherubs was still operating out of Richards' garage. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't afford to look too 'cottage industry,' " Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair spent long hours researching designs, colors, production methods and, 
perhaps the biggest hurdle, obtaining product liability insurance. Once the 
company was able to show a product to independent sales representatives and 
prospective customers, the product literally sold itself, Richards said. 
Nordstrom in San Diego became an early customer, a significant feather in the 
company's cap. 
</P>
<P>
"We literally had no competition when we started out" making fashion-oriented 
baby feeding products, Richards said. From $5,000 in sales in 1985, the company 
grew to $1.3 million in 1986, to $5.8 million in 1987 and to $8.3 million in 
1988. Company sources said Cherubs could have booked $20 million in sales last 
year if it had had the manufacturing capacity equal to demand. 
</P>
<P>
Competition soon surfaced, and now the baby bottle market is awash in brightly 
colored products modeled on Cherubs items, Richards said. Cherubs can maintain 
its market share only by maintaining its reputation for quality, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cherubs has received buy-out inquiries for the last couple of years. But the 
pair decided to sell only after running the company became an all-consuming 
task. Playtex had the good timing to make an offer they could not refuse, 
Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Both will continue to work for Playtex in consulting capacities, developing new 
products and helping out in sales and marketing. Cherubs will remain in 
Encinitas for the time being, although Richards conceded that chances are good 
that Playtex will someday move the company to its New Jersey manufacturing 
complex.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the American Stock Exchange index hitting an all-time high and the NASDAQ 
index flirting with an all-time high, San Diego stocks continued to forge 
ahead, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San 
Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Ten San Diego stocks reported 1989 highs for the week, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Laboratories logged the largest upward move, gaining $3.25 to a new 
high of $17, matching the $17-a-share merger bid announced last week by JAYCOR, 
a privately held defense contractor. Maxwell's board rejected that offer, but 
"it would appear that Maxwell Laboratories will be forced to consider other -- 
and maybe better -- offers as the stock now comes into play," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of Maxwell have vocally expressed disapproval of management at 
past shareholder meetings and probably would be amenable to a buyout at a 
higher price, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor Technologies recorded a new high of $8.125, gaining $1.375 for the 
week. The increase was probably driven by the Bush Administration's clean-air 
policy, which could eventually help Monitor's core air-monitoring business, 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Beeba's Creations set a new high of $15.125 on a report of a favorable upcoming 
earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates helped Great American First Savings Bank to a new high of 
$14.375 and Home Federal to a new high of $41.75. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc., which reported a 43% increase in fourth-quarter earnings and 
annual earnings of $.94 cents per share versus $.72 during the previous fiscal 
year, reached a new high of $21.50. 
</P>
<P>
Other new highs were recorded by Mycogen at $8.25, Burnham Pacific Properties 
at $19.375, and General Microelectronics $5.25. Fisher Scientific Group reached 
a new high of $20.75 after Henley Group, which owns 80% of Fisher's shares, bid 
$20.50 for remaining shares. The market seems to be indicating that the offer 
is inadequate, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
First National Corp. gained $.50 for the week and announced that it was in 
discussions to acquire Torrey Pines Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular Biosystems, one of the rare profitable biotechnology companies, 
reported good earnings for the year of $.24, versus $.11., and gained $.25 for 
the week.

MIDDLEMAN KENFIL GROWING IN TOUGH SOFTWARE BUSINESS 
</P>

Irwin A. Bransky's first experience with computers was a dismal one. It came, 
he said, when he flunked a course in FORTRAN, the granddaddy of computer 
languages, while in college in his native South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Bransky's first business venture in the United States also flopped. It was a 
Pioneer Chicken franchise that he owned in the early 1980s near Beverly Hills, 
hardly a fried chicken kind of town. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those early setbacks, Bransky, 38, a former leftist student leader at 
the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, has combined computers and 
business to build his second venture, Kenfil Distribution, into the nation's 
third-largest distributor of software for personal computers. For the year 
ending June 30, Bransky's privately owned Van Nuys company expects sales of 
just under $100 million. Six years ago, Bransky started the business, operating 
it out of a West Los Angeles garage. 
</P>
<P>
"They've grown enormously in a very difficult and competitive market where many 
others have failed. They hustle," said Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy, chairman of 
Ingram Micro D in Santa Ana, the nation's largest software distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Distributors such as Kenfil are middlemen who buy software from publishers and 
resell it to stores such as the Egghead Discount Software chain and Software 
Etc. Kenfil specializes almost exclusively in selling business software, which 
includes such programs as word processing, database software used for 
information storage and spreadsheet programs, which are something like 
electronic ledgers for accounting. Kenfil's best-selling program is 
WordPerfect, a popular word-processing software package. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its rapid growth, Kenfil is not an authorized distributor for some of 
the biggest and best-known software companies, such as Lotus Development, 
Ashton-Tate and Microsoft. Those companies limit their distributors to a highly 
select group, and Kenfil isn't one of them. Bransky said he is trying to woo 
Microsoft now. 
</P>
<P>
Without the biggest software companies as customers, however, Kenfil has relied 
largely on distributing software from smaller publishers, especially those who 
produce "utilities" programs that help users with such chores as recovering 
data that appears to be lost and software that builds backup systems to prevent 
losing computer data. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is keen in the software distribution business and profits are thin. 
One illustration is Math CAD, a program used by engineers that is made by 
Mathsoft in Cambridge, Mass. Kenfil buys it wholesale for $220 and resells it 
to retailers for $240, for a thin $20 gross profit. 
</P>
<P>
Kenfil has to pay its overhead, the salaries of about 100 employees and try to 
squeeze out a narrow profit. Bransky says Kenfil's profit after taxes is 
expected to be about 2.5% of its sales, meaning that it should net more than $2 
million for its fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Gleicher, chief executive of Soft-Kat, a Chatsworth software distributor, 
said distributors face another problem because large software retailers can 
bypass them and deal directly with publishers on the most popular software 
packages. By buying directly from the publisher, a large retailer can get much 
bigger discounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profits Slim 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the competition, the industry norm for software distributors is 
about 2 cents in profit for every $1 in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Bransky left South Africa 10 years ago, fed up, he said, with the government's 
apartheid policies and the constant strife they caused. A native of 
Johannesburg, Bransky had been active in one of that country's major student 
leftist groups in the 1970s before going to work in market research for A.C. 
Nielsen in South Africa before he moved to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his Pioneer Chicken experience, Bransky went to a computer show. 
As he was standing in line for a free Coke, he struck up a conversation with a 
man who was selling software. Bransky bought about $10,000 of it, figuring that 
he could resell it to a business contact in South Africa. That didn't work out, 
so he sold it to dealers in the United States instead. 
</P>
<P>
Using his father-in-law's garage as his headquarters, Bransky founded Kenfil in 
April, 1983, later moving to a 1,000-square-foot building in Reseda and 
ultimately to a location near Van Nuys Airport. About $50,000 was provided by 
his father-in-law, a developer, who also supplied him with the Kenfil name, 
which he had come up with by mixing the names of his son, Philip, and nephew, 
Kenneth. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bransky jokes, it means "Ken-fil the order." Sometimes, he said, it is 
"Kent-fil the order." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Competitor 
</P>
<P>
Bransky has earned a reputation as a brash, opinionated competitor, a "street 
fighter," as one competitor, who declined to speak for attribution, put it. 
When two competitors, Ingram and Micro D, merged to form the biggest 
distributor in the business, Bransky issued a press release calling the merger 
good for Kenfil because the companies would be too big to be attentive to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bizarre announcement," a Kenfil competitor said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenfil is also known as a price slasher. "We're sometimes referred to as the 
price whores of the industry," Bransky said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Papas, Kenfil's chief financial officer and senior vice president and a 
friend of Bransky's from South Africa, said that despite Kenfil's 
aggressiveness in pricing, the company does not sell products at a loss to gain 
a share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Delivery 
</P>
<P>
Bransky and other software distribution executives said price is no longer the 
primary concern of retailers. It is more important, they said, to be able to 
deliver products quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Kenfil has a reputation in the computer business for running a lean operation. 
In the early days, Bransky reused Styrofoam packing pellets and cardboard 
boxes. Until recently, Bransky and Papas helped pack software in the warehouse 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
They don't do that any more, but the operation is still lean. Bransky has no 
secretary, and the company's offices in Van Nuys are sparse. 
</P>
<P>
Kenfil also has only one warehouse, which it attributes to its decision to 
stick to software distribution rather than offering computer parts as many of 
its competitors do. Because it comes in small, light packages, software can be 
shipped easily and relatively cheaply across the country overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors contend that while Kenfil often slashes prices, it frequently does 
not match them in service and support operations for retailers, such as 
training classes to use the software. 
</P>
<P>
Papas counters by saying that Kenfil provides something many competitors do not 
-- people to talk to when customers call. He said most competitors have 
electronic "voice mail" systems that make it easier to take orders. But, he 
said, it often makes it frustrating for someone with a problem to hook up 
quickly with a person. 
</P>
<P>
"When you call Kenfil, you will speak to a human being," Papas said. "We will 
install voice mail in this company over my dead body."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: INCOMNET TO BUY BACK UP TO 500,000 SHARES OF STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incomnet, a Westlake Village operator of computer networks, said its directors 
authorized the company's repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of Incomnet's 
common stock. 
</P>
<P>
The stock would be bought back in periodic purchases over the next 12 months. 
The stock closed Monday at $1.03 a share in over-the-counter trading; at that 
price, the buyback would be valued at $515,000. 
</P>
<P>
The directors authorized the repurchase plan because they believe the stock is 
"undervalued at the present time," said Incomnet, which has about 13 million 
total shares outstanding.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMGEN PREPARING OFFERING OF DEBENTURES OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amgen said it has started preparing for a $50-million offering of subordinated 
convertible debentures to investors overseas, mainly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A convertible debenture is an unsecured bond that ultimately may be exchanged 
for stock in a company. Amgen, a Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, is being 
assisted in preparing the offering by Morgan Stanley International. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of 
Amgen's biotechnology drug erythropoietin, a long-awaited protein that treats 
chronic anemia in patients with kidney disease.

THE CASE OF THE CRIME-WRITING COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He drives too fast, can't fathom his ladyfriend's trust in institutions and 
wonders why others don't have his credo: If you don't make the rules, you're 
stuck with somebody else's. 
</P>
<P>
A thug? No, he's just the other side of the line -- a fixer for the good 
people. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fictional creation named Fiddler whom one industry source has 
compared to John D. MacDonald's famous knight errant, Travis McGee. 
</P>
<P>
What? Another book about a loner getting into nasty scrapes? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping Him Honest 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but there's a twist: he has a woman to keep him honest. She is Fiora, 
Fiddler's beautiful and brainy ex-wife who spends almost as much time with him 
divorced as she did when they were married. 
</P>
<P>
Fiora is largely the inspiration of Ann Maxwell of Laguna Niguel, who with her 
husband, Evan, created the Fiddler character six years ago by typing out a 
single paragraph on a home computer. 
</P>
<P>
The paragraph went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated violinist, guy from Montana, has perfect pitch but hands like veal 
shanks. Realizing he'll never be Itzhak Perlman, he wanders out to Southern 
California, where an uncle has left him a trunkful of C-notes. Rich now, he 
needs a reason to get up in the morning so he becomes a free-lance "problem 
solver." 
</P>
<P>
The Maxwells write under the name A. E. Maxwell. In the earlier books, 
Doubleday insisted on fuzzing the identity to imply that one person -- probably 
a man -- was writing the books. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann Maxwell did her own marketing research and convinced the publisher that 
thinking was out of date. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only is it OK for a woman to write about a tough guy," she said, "but it 
might even help sell him." 
</P>
<P>
That a woman character in the series is now emerging to be the equal of a man 
is not something you see very often in crime fiction, said Sheldon McArthur, 
who runs the Mysterious Book Shop in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Maxwells' latest book, "The Art of Survival," he observed: "It's the 
best book of the five and you know this series is just going to keep growing." 
</P>
<P>
In the mystery/crime genre a 10,000-book hardback run is considered good. 
Doubleday says its Fiddler series has jumped from a 6,000-copy run for the 
first book to 15,000 for the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The paperback versions have gone from 30,000 for the first book to 60,000 for 
the fourth, published last year, according to Doubleday publicist Sue Laizik. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Fiddler, "Just Enough Light to Kill," was chosen by Time magazine 
as one of the best crime novels of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And of the new one, Kirkus Reviews, a book industry forecaster, writes: "The 
writing is lean and restrained, the series is growing from book to book and it 
now gives Travis McGee a real run for his money." 
</P>
<P>
Travis hung out in Ft. Lauderdale. And Robert Parker's Spenser is from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Fiddler uses his muscle in places like Santa Fe, Newport Beach and Napa. 
</P>
<P>
"The Art of Survival," takes Fiddler from Santa Fe to Newport Beach in an art 
scam involving a faked Georgia O'Keeffe. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the books, Fiddler prevents California high technology from falling 
into the hands of the Russians. In another, a fiend tries to buy up Napa Valley 
property and then get around development restrictions by introducing a disease 
to destroy the vineyards, making the land good for nothing but malls and office 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiora Comes Clean 
</P>
<P>
But it is in book six, "Money Makes Everything Cheap," to be published next 
year, that Fiora really emerges, say the authors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to extend the genre to have a man and a woman working together 
as equals in crime fiction," said Evan Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Ann interrupted: "From the start I have insisted that Fiora had to emerge. In 
the first book she was a plot device -- she got kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally in crime fiction, women exist as a bedroom convenience or to 
screw up in order that the plot may progress. I wanted no part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Ann will work at her computer for a stretch, then pull out the disc 
and hand it to Evan to pop into his machine. Or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Evan, 46, a former reporter for the Los Angeles Times, brings a knowledge of 
law enforcement agencies and, as he put it, "an understanding of just how a 
crime or a big scam goes down." 
</P>
<P>
Ann, 45, not only helped create the Fiddler characters, she makes the stories 
hop, having mastered tight plotting with 30 previous books, most of them 
science fiction and romances. 
</P>
<P>
Much of their time is spent researching plot themes in the University of 
California, Irvine, library. They also visit locales from Seattle to Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The next book, for example, starts with a hike on Orange County's Modjeska 
Peak, where Fiddler and Fiora have decided to take a break from tackling 
people's problems to solve some for wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
They spend a day cleaning out artificial watering devices called 
quail-guzzlers, which dot the chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
But Fiddler does not do it joyfully. In the code he lives by, making animals 
dependent on such gadgets is an example of good intentions gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
As for people's problems, Ann says: "Fiddler is keenly aware that justice and 
law don't necessarily equate." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Maxwell will own up to specific lines in the Fiddler novels. 
</P>
<P>
"We are A. E. Maxwell," Ann said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
And they are reveling in the good news that's coming in these days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book of the Month 
</P>
<P>
"The Art of Survival" will be a Book of the Month Club selection for August, 
the same month the fourth book is released in paperback. 
</P>
<P>
That news the other day called for a nostalgic trip down to Fiddler's refuge -- 
Orange County's Crystal Cove. In the books, he lives in a house here with a 
pond full of koi in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the highway and looking down into this shabby-chic enclave of 1930s 
cottages, the Maxwells said there has been some fear the houses would be torn 
down when complicated leasing arrangements end. 
</P>
<P>
"But even if they bulldoze it," said Ann Maxwell, "Fiddler will live on. That's 
the great thing about creating a character."

JACK SMITH: MR. NICE GUY FALLS FROM HIS PEDESTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My admitting that I could not be a vegetarian because I can not give up eating 
hot dogs at baseball games has brought me more abuse than my revelation that 
God's name is Random Chance. 
</P>
<P>
N. Coulter of Venice calls my column "the subtle height of distaste," and says 
I am no longer "Mr. Nice Guy." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you live long enough," writes Judith Lautner of San Luis Obispo, "to 
think again about your statements on eating hot dogs and beer at baseball 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Yin of Rosemead argues that "speciesism is as indefensible as sexism or 
racism." She says that "animals may not have a right to vote, to enter 
restaurants, or to go to the theater, but they certainly have the right not to 
be mass-produced as a commodity, not to be tortured in laboratories, not to be 
killed in the name of sport." 
</P>
<P>
"The excuses for exploiting animals never cease to amaze me," writes Mary 
Delaney of Laguna Niguel. "Yes, I used to love hot dogs, but the decision to 
make a small sacrifice in order to boycott animal factories was much more 
fulfilling than a Dodger Dog." 
</P>
<P>
I have received many copies of magazine and newspaper articles describing the 
awful conditions in which food animals are kept and slaughtered. James Garner's 
euphoric TV ads for beef give no hint of these horrors. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dunkerly of Whittier sends me a publication of the Christian Animal Rescue 
Enterprise that lists various biblical references to the sanctity of animals. 
It quotes Genesis that animals have the same "breath of life" as man. 
Nevertheless, the Bible also reports that when the prodigal son returned, they 
barbecued the fatted calf. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Baron of Irvine writes that "the true test of a good and decent human being 
is whether we care for the rest of God's creation -- not just ourselves and 
other humans." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Frank Epstein of the Vegetarian Society of Southern California sends me a 
list of appalling statements culled from "Diet for a New America," by John 
Robbins. Among them: Risk of death from heart attack by average American man, 
50%; risk of death from heart attack by average vegetarian man, 15%; 
"hamburgers are ground-up cows who've had their throats slit by machetes or 
their brains bashed in by sledgehammers." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent issue of Newsweek, Meg Greenfield, a columnist whose work is 
usually soundly thought out and forcefully written, skated out on the 
treacherous ice of the vegetarian issue and came up with the strange compromise 
that, being a carnivore, she could not condemn the slaughter of food animals, 
and being a human being, she could not condemn the use of animals in medical 
research; but she came out strongly against the torture of animals in the 
search for a better perfume. Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
Donald G. Way sends me a column by the incomparable Mike Royko of Chicago. 
Royko notes that in April the San Diego Padres became the first baseball team 
in the history of our national sport to sell sushi to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
In a couple of hundred years, Royko said, when this once-great nation falls 
into its decline, that event will be pinpointed as the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
Royko traced this ignominy back to the Dodgers' move from Brooklyn to Los 
Angeles. "It was inevitable," he says. "Years ago, I told my friend Slats 
Grobnik: 'This is a bad thing for the country. Some day they will be selling 
sushi in ball parks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now a true vegetarian will not eat sushi, any more than he will eat hot dogs, 
but it seems to me that many people who pride themselves on not eating red meat 
or fowl have no compunction about devouring the lowly fish, which preceded us 
on this planet by several million years. 
</P>
<P>
Paul M. Thiele thanks me for introducing him to the word vegans, meaning people 
who do not use leather, wool, down or silk, besides not eating animals. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "That must explain the bumper stickers I've seen around town lately 
saying, 'Save the worms.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's his cynicism, not mine. I believe that if we are to grant all species 
the right to life, we must spare worms as well as cows, beetles as well as 
lambs, and pneumococci as well as chickens. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, nothing tastes quite as good as a Dodger Dog, with mustard.

Dr. Leeber Cohen was the active sort when he lived back in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., 
always pedaling his bicycle, jogging down the streets, practicing the piano or 
puttering in his back-yard flower beds in the posh Westchester County suburb. 
</P>
<P>
But about two years ago, the obstetrician, then 32, suddenly experienced a 
mysterious weakness in his right arm. First, medical colleagues said he must 
have suffered nerve damage while cycling. Then came terrible migraine 
headaches, which the experts blamed on stress. And when dizzy spells came on, 
an internist gave Cohen medication for vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing helped. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of feeling lousy, Cohen came up with his own theory -- that he 
had Lyme disease, a sometimes hard-to-recognize, potentially crippling malady 
borne largely by deer ticks that he may have picked up in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Serious Complaints' 
</P>
<P>
Several blood tests, spinal taps, CAT scans and intravenous antibiotic 
treatments later, Cohen thinks he has shaken the illness, though he still has a 
ringing in his ears that may never go away. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never really been on the other side of the bed before," said Cohen, who 
has since moved his practice to Chicago. "This was a very frustrating 
experience for me because I had very serious complaints that weren't taken 
seriously for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Cohen's experience is becoming increasingly common in some parts 
of the country as Americans head into another summer vacation season with 
something lurking in the trees and brush far more dangerous than poison ivy. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us grew up in a situation where you don't have to worry much about 
walking in the woods and catching diseases," said Phillip J. Pellitteri, an 
entomologist and Lyme expert at the University of Wisconsin. "That's changed." 
</P>
<P>
First identified only 14 years ago in Old Lyme, Conn., Lyme disease has swept 
across much of the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Experts say it has hit epidemic 
levels in a few hot spots, most seriously in New York, where more than 2,500 
cases were diagnosed last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control have detected a nine-fold annual increase 
in cases since it first began systematic tracking of Lyme. A spokesman for the 
Atlanta-based centers said more than 14,000 cases had been reported nationwide 
since 1980, most of them on the East Coast or in Wisconsin and Minnesota. 
Because Lyme is so new and symptoms vary so widely, doctors can fail to 
recognize the disease and cases may go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, some experts warn that most outbreaks are localized 
and suggest that the Lyme threat has been overblown in the media, unnecessarily 
scaring many people at low risk and sending hypochondriacs scurrying to their 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"In most of the states, only small numbers of cases have been reported," Dr. 
Theodore Tsai of a federal disease control laboratory in Ft. Collins, Colo., 
told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Though chances of contracting the disease are slight in much of the country, 
health officials say it is spreading and has been detected to varying 
</P>
<P>
degrees in at least 43 states, including California where the bulk of incidents 
have been limited so far to coastal counties north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Murray, a Lyme specialist with the California Department of Health 
Services, said the outbreak is not as serious in the state as elsewhere. But, 
he said, the department has confirmed about 400 Lyme cases that appear to have 
been contracted in California between 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ticks capable of carrying the Lyme bacteria have been found in most California 
counties, but Murray said that to date more than 70% of all cases of the 
disease in the state have been reported from Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and 
Humboldt counties. He added that the number of reported incidents is expected 
to rise in the wake of regulations, which took effect March 30, requiring 
doctors in California to notify state health officials of all suspected Lyme 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Caught early, Lyme is relatively easy to cure with doses of tetracycline, 
penicillin or other antibiotics. The problem, however, is catching it early. 
Ticks are so tiny and their bites often so soft that many victims don't even 
realize it. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically, a victim will come down with flulike symptoms and develop a 
circular rash around the bite area within three to 32 days after contact with 
an infected tick. But doctors say about half the children and one-third of the 
adults who get Lyme never develop the telltale rash. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the disease progresses, later stages are also treatable. But the 
medical regimen is more complex and some symptoms, like the tinnitus in Cohen's 
ears, may linger. Untreated, Lyme can mimic traits often associated with 
syphilis, entering into long periods of latency and then resurfacing with 
serious consequences such as rheumatoid arthritis, paralysis, heart block and 
even dementia. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Minnesota are working on a vaccine, but it is believed to be at 
least five years away from commercial application. 
</P>
<P>
Experts are not sure why the disease is mushrooming, though many believe a 
significant growth in deer herds in many parts of the country may be partly 
responsible. Infected ticks may also be hitching rides on migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
Though dozens of tick species can be found in this country, only a few so far 
have been identified as carriers of the spirochetes, or bacteria, that cause 
Lyme disease. The main culprit in the East and Midwest is Ixodes dammini, 
commonly known as a deer or bear tick. In the West, the primary carrier is 
Ixodes Pacificus, or the black-legged tick, which has slightly different 
feeding habits and doesn't appear to spread Lyme quite as readily as its 
Eastern cousin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chain of Events 
</P>
<P>
Ticks aren't born with the bacteria, but rather are the common carriers that 
transmit it in a complex chain of events that relies on animals as a medium in 
much the same manner that certain mosquitoes spread malaria. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, deer ticks feed and breed on the hides of deer, then females drop 
off to lay their eggs in brush. The larvae hatch and attach themselves to birds 
and small mammals, particularly mice. Many of the rodents already carry the 
Lyme bacteria, possibly having contracted it through previous tick bites, and 
pass it back to the new ticks who in turn can pass it on to whatever animal 
they hop on next. 
</P>
<P>
The spread of the disease is by no means uniform. In some spots in even the 
hardest hit states, entomologists have found tick populations relatively free 
of infection. In other places, however, the infection rate is staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Tests taken recently near Camp McCoy, a National Guard facility in western 
Wisconsin, found that 66% of the ticks, 90% of the mice and 16% of the deer in 
that area had traces of the Lyme spirochete in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling that you could find that high a percentage of ticks that 
are carriers if you're in the right area," said Wisconsin's Pellitteri. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dogs Present Problem 
</P>
<P>
Though they may be carriers of Lyme, mice and deer seem to be relatively 
unaffected by the disease, according to experts. However, veterinarians say the 
disease can produce arthritic and neurological symptoms in dogs, cattle and 
horses. And dogs pose a special problem for humans because they bring ticks 
into the house. 
</P>
<P>
The situation would almost certainly be worse if not for a biological quirk 
that slows Lyme transmission. After a tick latches on to some flesh, it takes 
at least 18 hours and often longer before any of the Lyme bacteria squirt into 
the system of a victim. Someone bitten by an infected tick can take a pair of 
tweezers, quickly remove the pest, and probably avoid the illness. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in New York and Wisconsin say they've fielded numerous inquiries from 
nervous tourists about Lyme, but so far see no evidence that vacationers are 
canceling reservations at resorts and parks. Still, health officials in several 
states have papered resorts, camps and schools with pamphlets warning of the 
dangers and giving tips on how to protect against ticks. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kazmierczak, a Lyme specialist with the Wisconsin health department, 
predicted that the threat will force a change in habits for campers and 
outdoorsmen as they learn to use more insect repellent, stick to the center of 
established forest trails and shun shorts when out in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance of Tick Checks 
</P>
<P>
"And conducting tick checks on yourself and your kids after you've been out in 
an endemic area may become as much a part of the routine of camping as brushing 
your teeth before you go to bed at night," Kazmierczak said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Riddleberger, an official with the New York branch of the American 
Camping Assn., said he was "surprised" that members had not been deluged with 
calls from parents concerned over whether they should cancel plans for their 
kids to attend day or overnight camps this summer. Nevertheless, Riddleberger 
said most camps are training counselors to avoid ticks, as well as cautioning 
parents about the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
And the dangers can be considerable. Just ask Richard Johnson, who finally 
closed his Eagle River, Wis., antique store in the North Woods last year when 
the pain from Lyme-related complications became unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Remain 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 62, thinks he picked up Lyme about six years ago, even though doctors 
didn't diagnose it until last year. Despite three series of antibiotic 
treatments, he still suffers from fatigue, achy joints and muscles, headaches, 
fevers and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
"You always know it's there," he said. "You just keep thinking about it. . . . 
When you feel a muscle cramp or your bones ache or you move one way or the 
other or have trouble sleeping or nerve distractions, naturally you think about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LYME DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
The carrier: The Western black-legged tick is the only tick out of 49 occurring 
in California that is known to transmit Lyme disease to humans, primarily from 
mice and deer. The actual size of the tick pictured at right is about 1/8 of an 
inch long before feeding. 
</P>
<P>
The range: A low percentage of the ticks tested so far are found to be 
carriers, but the ticks range in the state is wide. It can be found on grasses 
and brush in both urban and rural areas, and are most common in the humid 
coastal areas and on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada range. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding contact: When hiking, tuck pants into boots or socks and shirt into 
pants, and wear light-colored clothing so ticks can be easily seen. Use an 
insect repellent effective against ticks. Avoid contact with brush. 
</P>
<P>
If bitten, pull out tick promptly with tweezers so that mouth parts are removed 
from skin. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms: Spreading rash accompanied by flu-like fever and aches. Long-term 
possible complications may include disorders of the heart or nervous system, as 
well as severe arthritis. A blood test is needed to make a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment: Antibiotics during the early stages can cure the infection, but may 
not always be successful in the later stages.

ART BUCHWALD: WORKING OVERTIME AT THE RUMOR MILL

Just down the street from the Republican National Headquarters is a large, 
dirty pool, where reporters and party workers relax after work and exchange 
rumors about politicians. Some people call it mud-slinging, but it's really 
good, old-fashioned jawboning that we all enjoy at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The mud can be supplied by anyone -- from a party secretary to a top-flight GOP 
manager, who has access to the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
This is how it went the other day: An aide came over from headquarters and 
announced, "Congressman Meadowlark is a fly-chaser. Pass it on." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed hard to believe except for the fact that we heard it with our own 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
The questions came out fast and furious. 
</P>
<P>
"Has anyone ever seen him chase flies?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but the source was impeccable. A party intern heard it from his father, 
who dated Meadowlark's sister's roommate." 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be true," a reporter said, "but if I don't write about it, I'll catch 
hell from my editor." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you say, 'There is no truth to the rumor that a congressman, who is 
chairman of a very important committee, was seen chasing flies in the halls of 
Congress after dark'?" 
</P>
<P>
The Republican mud-slinger told him, "I didn't say that he is a fly-chaser now. 
I said that he was one in his youth." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any difference," another reporter added. "I've always thought 
that where there is smoke, there is unethical conduct. Why don't we ask 
Meadowlark outright if he was one? If he denies it, it will be a bigger story 
than if he admits the charge." 
</P>
<P>
The person who leaked the information spoke up, "Don't mention where you got 
it. Everyone around here is very touchy. The last time Mark Goodin, the PR 
director, threw mud at Tom Foley, he was given the ax." 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't a very good sleaze-ball artist," I said. "Or he wouldn't have been 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
A network reporter told us, "We're wasting time. While we're in this dirty pool 
the whole damn press corps is writing about Meadowlark's penchant for chasing 
flies." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican leaker reassured him, "Nobody knows about it but you guys. We 
wanted to make sure that our friends were the ones to run him out of town." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so he likes to chase flies. Does that mean he can't do his job?" another 
reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter next to him, Marilee Keefe, chimed in, "It's not for us to say 
whether he can or not. Our only role is to make sure that the public knows 
about it. If the other party wants a fly-chaser passing laws, good luck to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
I said, "My report will state that while there is absolutely no proof that 
Meadowlark is the biggest fly-chaser in Washington, everyone in this town is 
calling for his resignation." 
</P>
<P>
Another newspaperman, who was working on his word processor at the end of the 
pool, yelled, "Hey, what is the definition of a fly-chaser?" 
</P>
<P>
His buddy answered, "My dictionary says, 'A fly-chaser is a baseball outfielder 
who runs after balls.' " 
</P>
<P>
Everybody in the pool was furious. One reporter spluttered, "They did it to us 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Atwater came out of Republican Party headquarters and spoke to the group, 
"I'm sorry, fellows. I have never seen such a dirty political story in my life, 
and I am going to fire the person who circulated it, because I have to look at 
myself in the mirror every morning."

MAINLY MOZART FESTIVAL A MOSTLY ORDINARY EVENT

David Atherton wrapped up his Westgate Mainly Mozart Festival in style Sunday 
night. A strong all-Mozart program, lively performances from the players, and a 
full house in Davies Festival Theatre provided ample reasons for the British 
maestro's air of self-assurance and confidence on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
In this farewell program, two of the festival orchestra members favored the 
audience with solo turns. Concertmaster William Preucil's performance as 
soloist in Mozart's "Turkish" Violin Concerto was conventional and rather 
small-scaled, although it was still polished and brimming with conviction. His 
sweet, agile sound flourished in the intimate middle movement, where he ably 
captured the composer's transcendental introspection. 
</P>
<P>
Although flutist Jean Larson's solo was limited to the single movement "Andante 
for Flute and Orchestra," K. 315, she made the most of her opportunity. Her 
playing Sunday confirmed the favorable impression she made in a festival 
chamber concert last week: the silver-toned Texas flutist can spin out a 
sinuous melody with grace, charm, and apparent nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to demonstrate Mozart's development as a symphonist, Atherton commenced 
his program with the composer's First Symphony, K. 16 (written when he was 8 
years old), and concluded with his penultimate Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, K. 
550. Even though this First Symphony is little more than a curiosity, the 
conductor took pains to make the most of it, demanding precise articulations 
and assiduous adherence to its naive, rococo contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
If only Atherton had delved as deeply and patiently into the great G Minor 
Symphony. He took an aggressive stance, demanding a Beethoven-like grandeur 
rather than cultivating the undercurrent of turbulence that propels this 
complex, late Mozart work. He was satisfied with high energy and tight 
discipline, but there was little poetry beneath all of that brio. And, although 
this approach may have generated a few more decibels for the unsympathetic 
acoustics of the open-air theater, it brought out an unflattering, hard-edged 
timbre in the strings. 
</P>
<P>
This reviewer's evaluation of the festival's inaugural season remains 
equivocal. While it was well-organized and well-attended, its musical 
achievements were embarrassingly modest. If the level of performance never sank 
below professional respectability, it rarely soared or strayed from the norms 
of traditional Mozart interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Chamber Music Society's annual SummerFest, to cite the record of 
another well-run festival, has provided the crucible for some spine-tingling 
performances and daring interpretations of major works of the repertory. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of repertory, Atherton's choices cry out for improvement, especially 
if the festival is to continue next year. The festival's title may have been 
"Mainly Mozart," but the rest of the repertory was surprisingly miscellaneous. 
Although Atherton's programming did not stray beyond the Classical period -- 
creative choices might have juxtaposed neo-Classical 20th-Century works -- not 
a single major work by Beethoven or Haydn complemented the Mozart repertory.

Authorities in Mexico City have recovered scores of priceless jade, gold and 
stone artifacts taken in the 1985 Christmas Day robbery of the National Museum 
of Anthropology. Federal agents found 133 of the 140 stolen treasures from the 
ancient Mayan, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations in canvas sacks stashed 
in a home in suburban Mexico City. Ten people were arrested after a series of 
raids on several residences. Among the items recovered were a Zapotec mask of 
the bat god Murielago and an obsidian Aztec sculpture of a monkey. Experts have 
described them as two of the most valuable pieces in a museum crammed with 
irreplaceable objects from civilizations dating back thousands of years. ALEENE

Three performers who appeared in "Gone With the Wind" helped mark the 50th 
anniversary of the Academy Award-winning film at the annual Clark Gable 
celebration over the weekend in Gable's birthplace, Cadiz, Ohio. On hand were 
Cammie King Conlon, who played Scarlett and Rhett's child, Bonnie Blue; Patrick 
Curtis, who was Ashley and Melanie Wilkes' infant son, and Fred Crane (the 
former longtime classical music program host at KFAC in Los Angeles), who had 
the role of Brent Tarleton, one of Scarlett's suitors. The celebration was 
sponsored by the Clark Gable Foundation, which plans to build a theater and 
museum where Gable films would be shown year-round. Gable was born in Cadiz, 
but grew up in nearby Hopedale. ALEENE MacMINN

Ex-model and restaurateur Marilyn Lewis, who was once part of the Andy Warhol 
clique and is now making a documentary about the artist, believes Warhol was 
"one of the most unusual men of our times. He was terribly religious. He was a 
voyeur regarding drugs, sex and other elements of life but not a participant." 
Lewis suspects the world hasn't seen the last of Warhol. "I believe Andy is an 
afterlife person. He spent his life preparing for a reincarnation." ALEENE

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: POWERFUL WORKS IN DOCUMENTARY FESTIVAL

The American Film Institute will present the 15th annual Global Village 
Documentary Festival -- consisting of 25 film, video and made-for-television 
documentaries -- in its Mark Goodson Screening Room nightly from Friday through 
June 24. 
</P>
<P>
Living up to its title, the festival offers works ranging from Central America 
to AIDS to child abuse to a 190-minute chronicle about a Houston neighborhood 
that has experienced integration, blockbusting, white flight and now 
gentrification. A preview sampling of the festival's selections is encouraging 
in the utmost. 
</P>
<P>
The festival gets off to an upbeat, inviting start with Laurie Taylor Williams 
and Merce Williams' 75-minute film, "Yours to Keep," an irresistible, 
straightforward portrait of Taylor Williams' 19-year-old brother John, a 
self-described "Down's syndrome kid" who says he's "just a little bit retarded, 
that's all." John has had the good fortune to have a loving family that has 
developed a keen sense of how to be supportive without being overly protective. 
We meet him just as he's off to his senior prom. It's also time for him to 
start looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
After several disappointments, John, out of the blue, lands a role in the film 
"The Seventh Sign," in which he plays a youth with Down's syndrome who is 
sentenced to death for killing his parents because "God told me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
A young man with a sunny, affectionate personality, John possesses an 
encyclopedic knowledge of pop music of the '70s and early '80s, loves to talk 
through his Kermit the Frog hand puppet, which he calls his alter ego -- his 
father makes him look up the term in the dictionary to make sure he knows what 
he's talking about -- and is completely realistic about the odds against 
sustaining an acting career. 
</P>
<P>
Articulate and good-natured, John challenges the conventional notions of mental 
retardation. Remarkably, observing his mother's overjoyed reaction to his 
winning the part in the film, he asks her, "Are you laughing at the irony of 
it, or are you laughing at me?" 
</P>

Estela Bravo's 43-minute video "Holy Father and Gloria" (Saturday at 7 p.m.) is 
the first of several powerful works on political conditions in Latin America. 
The film crackles with emotional intensity as Bravo counterpoints the visit of 
Pope John Paul to Chile with the public emergence of Carmen Gloria Quintero, a 
teen-ager apparently dosed in gasoline and set on fire by the Chilean military, 
who has survived to become a heroine of the resistance against Gen. Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
This is a work of courage and immediacy, recording the impassioned protests of 
the vast numbers of people who have come out to greet the weary, formidable yet 
compassionate Pope, who predictably dwells on the spiritual rather than the 
political. 
</P>
<P>
Screening Sunday, following the 8:30 p.m. screening of an hourlong video on 
writer Alice Walker, is another of the Latin American documentaries, David 
Bradbury's 63-minute "South of the Border," in which Bradbury, an Australian 
film maker best known for the prize-winning "Nicaragua: No Pasaran," reveals 
the importance of music in the lives of the oppressed of Guatemala, El Salvador 
and Nicaragua. Their songs, which are simple, beautiful and impassioned, not 
only sustain them in adversity, keeping alive their cause and preserving their 
culture, they also serve to undercut the pervasiveness of American pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"South of the Border" is followed by Mark Samels and Paul Watson's 
"Revelations," a 57-minute video they made for WNPB-TV in Morgantown, W.Va. For 
reasons not at all clear, the video makers intercut quick cuts of TV 
programming with their study of State Trooper Larry Smith and his family over 
Thanksgiving, 1987. These TV inserts serve only to distract from the Smiths, 
who are worthy of our attention. Larry Smith is a middle-aged Vietnam War 
veteran, conservative and religious. You may not agree with his views on 
homosexuals or share his passion for hunting, but there is no denying he is a 
solid citizen, a staunch representative of blue-collar America rightly 
concerned about the future of his family and his country. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a panel discussion on June 22 at 7 p.m. Full schedule and further 
program information: (213) 856-7696, 865-7787.

The controversy swirling around KVEA Channel 52, the Los Angeles 
Spanish-language station targeted by Latino community protesters last week, 
took a new turn Monday when officials for the station's parent Telemundo 
network agreed to talks next week with some of its critics. Network officials 
made the move after receiving a letter from the Los Angeles-based National 
Hispanic Media Coalition urging Telemundo to discuss its alleged failure "to 
meet the needs of the Latino community." Among other complaints, the letter 
asserts that the directors of Estrella Communication Inc., KVEA's license 
holder, has no Latino on its nine-member board and that there is only one 
Latino on Telemundo's board of directors. The coalition had asked that its 
letter be answered by Friday. ALEENE MacMINN

Martin Scorsese has directed his first commercial for American television, and 
it was only another Italian who could get him to do it. Scorsese was given 
total creative control on the 30-second spot for Armani, Milanese designer 
Giorgio Armani's signature men's fragrance. Insiders report that the commercial 
is minimalist, to say the least. There's no dialogue and the setting is spare 
in the extreme. Armani, for his part, told Scorsese to avoid "just selling sex" 
and wanted an elegant tone. Scorsese, currently filming "Good Fellows" with 
Robert DeNiro, told friends he found trying to tell a story in 30 seconds was 
the "one of the hardest things" he ever had to do. But what really convinced 
him to work with Armani was that he couldn't pass up the opportunity to spend 
some time in Italy. The commercial, filmed in Milan, debuts this week. ALEENE

USC STUDENT FILMS SHOW TALENT AND HUMANE QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lavish University of Southern California Cinema School program "First 
Look," which begins tonight, offers 26 student films in four programs, most 
mixing the usual USC high polish and technical expertise with the new emphasis 
on challenging scripts encouraged by Frank Daniel, dean of the school. Overall, 
it's a fine selection. 
</P>
<P>
The screenings, which continue on Thursday, next Tuesday and June 22, all at 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, at 7:30 p.m., 
show less high-concept glitz, more humane grit. 
</P>
<P>
For the students themselves, there's a new inducement: a school agreement with 
Jonathan Krane of Management Co. Entertainment Group, which will underwrite the 
semi-annual showings, to develop one or more of these scripts and finance one 
or more directors. A fine spur, but it suggests a problem: As in many other 
college film programs, USC's, as of now, doesn't guarantee a fair contest. Some 
films look as if they cost $100,000 or more; some, obviously much less. As 
always, the student who, through independent means or family connections, has 
access to more money, gets a built-in, highly questionable edge. 
</P>
<P>
Those moral issues, however, are for others. We can content ourselves with a 
salute to all the participants: all the high talent and hard work visible here. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's screening includes two engagingly paranoid "What if?" comedies: Bruce 
Worrilow's "The Worst That Could Happen" -- what if an energetic pet-shop Don 
Juan impregnated all three of his revolving girlfriends? And Tony Kant's 
darker-hued "An Even Break" -- what if a distracted wrecker involved in a 
custody battle tore down the wrong house and got blackmailed by his boss into a 
life of crime? Also: Sharon Altman's charming ethnographic cartoon, "Maheo's 
Dance," and David Parks' "Images" a marriage memoir that suggests TV ad 
montages at their most lushly sorrowful. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat more serious is James Middleton's "Solo Run," a very compassionate 
study of the relationship of a young boy, his lesbian mother and his prejudiced 
father and stepmother. And David Hartwell's "Slipknot" -- longest and flashiest 
of the films -- uses Spielberg-DePalma camera angles and glistening colors for 
the hysterical story of a young girl watching her brother slide into drugs and 
madness. Hartwell doesn't indict the usual villains of these "Splendor in the 
Grass"-style romantic essays -- the parents -- and, at times, he overtips into 
"Reefer Madness" camp. But he doesn't shoot a dull frame and his lead actress, 
Kate Hall, has powerful moments. 
</P>
<P>
Program 2 (Thursday) includes two interesting documentaries: Brian Fairlee's 
"My Friends, My Friends" on teen-age drunk driving in a small Northern 
California town and Maria Gallagher's more ambitious "Face Value," which 
follows a young 15-year-old prospective cover girl through the glib wilderness 
of high-fashion huckstering. Elizabeth Passarelli's "Dark Rooms," a blend of 
documentary techniques and drama, re-creates the dilemma of a young girl 
date-raped at a party, with unusual truth and objectivity. Mar Elepano and 
Screescanda's "A La Turk" adds visual embellishments patterned on Norman 
McLaren and Oskar Fischinger onto the Dave Brubeck Quartet's "Blue Rondo." And 
"Channing," directed by John Shorney and written by Adam Belanoff (one of 
several films transferred from video), has effective low-key child acting -- by 
Gary Cohen and Joshua Smith, in a pleasant, if oft-repeated, tale of the brainy 
kid and his schoolyard tormentor. 
</P>
<P>
On Program 3, (next Tuesday), another, more conventional small town -- with 
youngsters seeking escape, ensnared by villains and daddy-cops -- turns up in 
"Shelter in the Storm," directed by David Klass, written by Alex Graves. Both 
"Jack Falls Down" (directed by John Kim, written by Michael Matlock) and "Life 
Could be Worse" (directed by Ron Rosen, written by Jeff X. Rothstein) offer 
romantic fables about games with the hereafter. Death intrudes in the former, 
to bring a couple of insurance people dangerously together in a clock-race 
dance of murder. In the latter, more comically, an obsessed Jewish mortuary 
owner, gets advice from the beyond on handling his recalcitrant son; here, the 
acting ensemble tempers sitcom exaggerations with cute, deft little throwaways. 
</P>
<P>
On Program 4 (June 22), Todd Yellin's racily funny, high-pressure "The Eternal 
Pitch" has another clock-race: a gambling telephone salesman trying to snap up 
10 customers by midnight to save himself from disaster. Howard Slavitt's 
"Summer Rain" is another memory piece -- with sexual tensions lurking under a 
Norman Rockwell period family outing. Charles Evans' "Second Son," a slightly 
strained melodrama about a rich boy seeking to rescue his black ex-maid from 
drunkenness and her macho Marine son, has poignant central performances by 
singer Ketty Lester, Byron Thames and Michael James. And Dennis Dimster-Denk's 
"Concrete River," the only overtly experimental work, is a good, 
impressionistic study of the L.A. freeways, with an undercurrent of malaise and 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
One fascinating comparison: The widely different films that two directors, 
Rusty Gorman and Nicole Bettauer, make from the same screenplay: Paul 
McCudden's excellent medieval fable, "Tree of Battles" -- with its intense 
evocation of a plague-ridden France, a wandering, English knight and the French 
peasant boy yoked to him, by death and isolation. Both versions work: Gorman's 
(on Thursday) is more real, rawer, closer to the ground, shot through the weeds 
and dirt; Bettauer's (next Tuesday) is more glossily epic and picturesque, in 
the "Ladyhawke" vein.

PLAN OFFERED TO MERGE ELECTIONS IN CITY WITH NATIONAL, STATE VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that could dramatically increase the paltry number of Los Angeles 
voters who turn out to elect city officials, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky on 
Monday proposed that city elections be held at the same time as state and 
national balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which would shift city elections from so-called "off-years" that 
end in odd numbers to even years in which higher-level campaigns are conducted, 
comes amid pondering at City Hall about dismal voter turnouts in city elections 
in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
This month's general city election, which filled several school board seats and 
one City Council position, drew only 10.9% of the city's registered voters, 
most of them in the 7th District, where more than 20% of the voters cast 
ballots for incumbent Ernani Bernardi or his unsuccessful challenger, Lyle 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary election in April, in which the mayor and nearly half of the 
City Council were elected, only 24.3% of the city's registered voters 
participated. Overall, almost 1.4 million city residents are registered to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think to have 24% of this city determining who the mayor, the city attorney 
and eight members of the City Council will be is not satisfactory," said 
Yaroslavsky, whose plan would have to be approved first by the council and then 
by voters on the 1990 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is: How do you get people involved? If June and November (state and 
federal elections) have 50% to 60% turnouts and April and June (city elections) 
have a steady decline, then face up to the fact. If you want to get a higher 
turnout, consolidate to the elections with the higher turnout." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, state and federal elections have drawn more voters than local 
elections. Figures collected by Yaroslavsky's staff showed that 64% of the 
city's registered voters cast ballots in the November, 1988, presidential 
election, almost three times the number who showed up for the city election 
five months later. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, general election turnout for even-year state and federal elections 
has exceeded 45%. The last time a city general election surpassed that level 
was in 1973, when then-Mayor Sam Yorty was challenged successfully by 
then-Councilman Tom Bradley after a raucous campaign. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elias Martinez, whose office runs the city's elections, said the 
notion of changing the election date has not been seriously debated since he 
took office in 1983. But those favoring off-year city elections have argued 
that local elections can get lost amid a crush of state and federal issues if 
the elections are concurrent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, he added, voters tend to lose interest as they get to the back 
of a lengthy ballot -- which is where city races would be in a consolidated 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"Voters tend to vote for the most important races at the top of the ballot and 
then lower on the ballot, tend to not vote at all," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
That argument drew a sharp retort from Yaroslavsky, who said the number of 
voters who lose interest toward the end of long ballots is slight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say that city elections could be any more buried than when you 
have a 10.9% turnout," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman's proposal, which will be introduced to the council today, would 
not affect the next round of city elections, which will take place in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In 1992, however, a city primary would be held in June for citywide offices, 
odd-numbered council districts and even-numbered school board districts. Runoff 
elections, if needed, would be held that November. The winners, however, would 
not take office until July, 1993, after the current officeholders -- who were 
elected this year and must by charter serve a full four years -- leave. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, elections would be held in 1994 for terms beginning in 1995. The 1992 
and 1994 winners would serve 3 1/2-year terms, so that they would leave office 
in January at the same time as federal and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
After those cycles, council members would be elected in June and November of 
even-numbered years and would take office in January, serving full four-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also move forward to January, 1992, the scheduled council 
redistricting.

SYMBOL IS UNSHAKEN;

<P>
TEMBLOR, TECHNOCRATS FAIL TO MOVE CHINESE PROTEST MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN and PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing tall against both temblors and technocrats, a hastily erected 
23-foot-high replica of the "Goddess of Democracy" statue destroyed by Chinese 
troops during the Beijing massacre won city permission Monday morning to remain 
atop a Civic Center footbridge. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-pound monument, built of wood and plastic foam, was installed within 
45 minutes by a band of Los Angeles arts activists Monday morning -- without a 
city permit. When police and fire officials arrived minutes later, they quickly 
declared it a hazard to the Temple Street traffic below and ordered it removed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo and city cultural affairs chief Adolfo (Al) Nodal 
stepped in. Calling the statue a "terrific symbol," Woo rushed to the Board of 
Public Works, which had a regular meeting scheduled at 9:30 a.m. The board 
agreed to cut through red tape and take up the unusual matter half an hour 
later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That Tells You Something' 
</P>
<P>
Then, at three minutes before 10 a.m., the earth shook. But despite the 4.5 
magnitude quake, the statue stood unbowed. 
</P>
<P>
"That tells you something," said Tom Van Sant, the artist who began designing 
and constructing the sculpture at his Santa Monica studio last Thursday. 
"Nature can't get it down; only the Department of Public Works can." 
</P>
<P>
When the Board of Public Works finally took up the matter, its members -- 
citing the earthquake as a true test of the statue's stability -- voted 
unanimously to allow it to remain in place for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it just got a special test of its structural integrity," board 
President Edward J. Avila said. "This board would not consider this matter in 
other circumstances, but the force of this message (for democracy) is of such 
magnitude we believe it is important that the symbol remain up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tethered With Cables 
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of Public Works engineers, the board directed that the 
monument be tethered with metal cables. Van Sant, who also designed the 
footbridge for the city in 1974, assured the board that the arched span can 
support his artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"You can put 1,000 people on that bridge and it would not compress," Van Sant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds after the board vote, a 4.3 magnitude aftershock hit, but the statue 
again remained unshaken. 
</P>
<P>
A Public Works crew then went to work at the footbridge, supplying two cherry 
pickers and guy wire. As appreciative onlookers watched, Van Sant boarded one 
of the cranes to crown the monument with a torch held high. 
</P>
<P>
"All right!" yelled Bill Lasarow, former president of the local chapter of 
Artists Equity Assn., a national visual artists service organization. 
</P>
<P>
Lasarow's group of eight artists had decided to erect the monument last Monday, 
two days after Chinese troops stormed Tien An Men Square, killing scores of 
students and bulldozing the towering symbol of their movement. 
</P>
<P>
The statue "is saying we support the aspirations of the Chinese people -- 
freedom, democratic reforms and a more open society," Lasarow said. "We want to 
say we're watching what the Chinese government is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant was initially moved to build the statue after he watched a protest by 
400 Chinese students during a trip to Boston last week. He and other Artist 
Equity Assn. members notified city officials that they planned to erect the 
monument, but did not say where it would go up. Because time was of the 
essence, the artists explained Monday, they decided to act first and then seek 
a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials who had sought to have the statue removed took pains 
to say that their concerns dealt with safety, not the monument's message. "We 
all support what the statue symbolizes; it's just unsafe," LAPD Sgt. Robert 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, police helped block off Temple Street, between Main and Los 
Angeles streets, to assist the Public Works crewmen as they secured the statue. 
Grant joined in the applause when the torch was affixed. 
</P>
<P>
The pedestrian walkway, which connects City Hall East and the north end of the 
downtown Mall near the Los Angeles Children's Museum, will be closed through 
next Monday. During that time, the Board of Public Works will search for 
another site for the statue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Beautiful' 
</P>
<P>
The replica, one of several that have sprung up across the nation in the last 
week, drew support from passers-by. "I think it's beautiful," said Dan Wing, a 
Civic Center worker. "This is a time when we have to state our thoughts and 
support the movement in China." 
</P>
<P>
Others, though, questioned the statue's seemingly precarious perch. And a 
handful remained downright perplexed. "I don't know what it is," said a city 
traffic officer directing vehicles away from the roadway beneath the bridge. 
"It has something to do with China?" 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, the statue had become a certifiable tourist attraction. An 
elderly Chinese couple, who had emigrated from Hunan to Cerritos and just 
received their permanent U.S. residency papers at the nearby Federal Building, 
posed in front of the goddess. And an artist sat at the foot of the statue, 
hoping that his portrayal of the goddess can be sent back to China via a 
facsimile machine for use as a poster. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the response to the project, Van Sant said he wants to build a 
permanent monument. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll make it out of Georgia white marble," he said. "And when (the Chinese) 
finally get democracy and personal freedoms, we'll give one to them."

L.A.'S ETHICS PANEL URGED TO COVER GAPS IN STATE'S SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The architect of the state's Political Reform Act, saying that California's key 
political watchdog agency conducts almost no investigations of city officials 
unless it is tipped off by the press or receives a complaint, Monday 
recommended that the city's Ethics Commission consider creating a local entity 
to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Stern, general counsel for the California Commission on Campaign 
Financing, also recommended that the Ethics Commission explore a law to allow 
random audits of city officials' complete financial holdings, including their 
checking and savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that because the state Fair Political Practices Commission must 
review thousands of economic disclosure forms submitted by state, county and 
city officials, it does not have the staff to "look . . . for substantive 
problems, for thin ice" except among state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the FPPC, confirmed that because the agency 
receives 15,000 disclosure forms from statewide officials and officials of 58 
counties and more than 400 cities each year, it must rely in large part upon 
complaints from individuals and upon news stories to ferret out wrongdoing 
among local officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a monumental task to review everything that's filed with us," she 
said. Although disclosure forms submitted by state officials are reviewed in 
detail, reports from local officials are reviewed only to determine if they 
were properly completed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stern spoke Monday morning before the city Ethics Commission, which is 
appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and is charged with writing a new political 
ethics code for Los Angeles. Stern was joined by Melvin Cooper, director of 
Alabama's Ethics Commission, who is considered an expert in political ethics 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Cowan, chairman of the seven-member city panel, said he expects the 
group to complete a rough draft of the new code in October. Cowan said he and 
other panel members, including Archbishop Roger Mahony, Rabbi Allen Freehling, 
Los Angeles County Bar Assn. President Margaret Morrow and other civic leaders, 
will continue their work independently of the City Council, which plans to 
consider its own package of reforms in mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said that among the questions being investigated by his commission are 
how to relax a state law that severely restricts the ability of the city to 
name a special prosecutor to investigate corruption and how to ensure that city 
lobbyists are more closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Both Stern and Cooper urged the Ethics Commission to consider a plan to require 
more detailed reports on the personal investments of public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, city officials currently are allowed to report stock and other 
holdings in broad categories of $1,000 to $10,000, $10,001 to 100,000, and 
$100,000 and up. The $100,000-and-up category, in particular, prevents the 
public from understanding the true level of a politician's holdings. Stern said 
he would like to see categories created "for over $500,000 and over $1 million" 
in order to correct that problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Holdings 
</P>
<P>
Stern also said, however, that too much effort is spent requiring politicians 
to report small holdings in large corporations over which they hold little or 
no sway. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to see "less emphasis on reporting what you hold in large 
corporations like IBM, and maybe the threshold there can be increased" to 
require only the reporting of holdings worth at least $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper told the Ethics Commission that its prime objective should be to ensure 
that the laws it recommends have enough teeth to "increase the confidence of 
the public in the integrity of government officials." 
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, he noted, any public employee making $25,000 or more must file an 
economic disclosure form. Moreover, all public officials are barred from 
accepting gifts or honorariums. Neither of those regulations exists in 
California.

STATE FUNDS EXPECTED TO AVERT CUTS, HEALTH CHIEF GATES SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health Director Robert Gates told the Board of Supervisors on Monday that he is 
optimistic Los Angeles County will receive enough money from the $2.5-billion 
state surplus to avert long-threatened cuts in health services. 
</P>
<P>
But while providing enough money to salvage needed programs, Gates said, the 
surplus may not prove enough of a bonus to ensure pay raises for all employees 
-- and layoffs still loom as a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people concerned about the threatened cuts -- despite the surplus -- 
turned out at the Hall of Administration to urge the supervisors to supplement 
any state aid with county funds to reduce the long waits for services at 
clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The long lines, speakers told the board, often discourage patients from seeking 
care until they must receive treatment in the emergency room at higher expense. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' hearing, required by state law, was scheduled before state 
officials last month announced that there would be an unexpected surplus in 
California's own revenues that could be used to help local governments and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials earlier had proposed $55.7 million in health cuts 
-- including closing dozens of pediatric facilities, outpatient health centers 
and family planning clinics and reducing services at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm quite optimistic that we won't have to make those curtailments," Gates 
told the supervisors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said he expects the county to receive an additional $123 million in state 
aid. The additional amount, in excess of the $55.7 million, will be used to 
help pay for salary raises for employees and cost increases for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Insufficient 
</P>
<P>
The additional aid, however, may not be enough to cover pay raises for all 
employees, possibly necessitating layoffs, Gates added. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn opened the five-hour hearing by urging people in the 
audience to "go to Sacramento" to lobby state officials for more money for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for speaking," Hahn said before anyone in the audience went to the 
microphone. "But we don't have any money in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers said they have been lobbying state officials. But they 
contended that county officials could find money in the proposed $9.2-billion 
county budget to improve the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
They complained that funding for health services has declined since 1980, when 
a conservative majority came to power on the board and began redirecting funds 
from social services to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gates, funding for health care has been reduced from 16.8% of the 
county's total funding in the 1980-81 fiscal year to 8% in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
'Even if there are no cuts . . . it is very important that the county address 
the existing problems," said Melinda Bird, an attorney at the Western Center 
for Law and Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Bird told supervisors that critically ill patients spend up to five days "on 
gurneys in hallways" waiting for admission to intensive-care units. 
</P>
<P>
She also presented the board with what she said were sworn declarations from 
more than 40 county doctors and nurses attesting to "preventable" patient 
deaths and "unnecessary" suffering they have witnessed due to overcrowded, 
underfunded county health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid attorneys announced last week that they would present the affidavits 
to the board. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Gates said that sometimes "people aren't where they ought to 
be in our system . . . . I think there are compromises (but) we think not to 
the point of seriously affecting patient care." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Pete Schabarum were absent Monday. 
Schabarum had other commitments, according to an aide who declined to be more 
specific. Antonovich was in Switzerland attending an international conference 
on refugee relief. 
</P>
<P>
But conservative Supervisor Deane Dana said that health services "still takes a 
tremendous part of our budget," accounting for $1.9 billion of the proposed 
$9.2-billion spending program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no other areas to cut back," he said. "What do they want us to do -- 
close down the libraries?" 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors will continue public hearings through Friday. Budget deliberations 
will begin July 19.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHILD DEPORTEES FACE ABUSE, ACTIVIST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children deported to Mexico after illegally entering Southern California are 
routinely thrown together with juvenile criminals in Tijuana jails where they 
are often mistreated and abused, according to an immigrants rights advocate who 
visited Los Angeles to rally support for a petition to the Mexican government 
on behalf of the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Perez Canchola, director of the Center for Migrant Investigations and 
Studies, said last week that U.S. immigration authorities turn over about 20 
unaccompanied youngsters daily to Mexican authorities, an increase of more than 
25% over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The increase has also been noted by social workers in Los Angeles who say they 
have seen a growth in the number of homeless immigrant children traveling on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
The children are held in jail for about a week, pending deportation to their 
countries or passage back to their homes in the interior of Mexico, Perez said. 
Most range in age from 9 to 16, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN RAPED, LOCKED IN CAR TRUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were being held for questioning Monday in the kidnaping, beating and 
rape of a Downey woman who was attacked after her assailants deliberately 
rammed their car into hers to get her to pull off the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's ordeal, which began at 1:30 a.m. Saturday on the 605 Freeway in 
Norwalk, did not end until 4 p.m. Sunday, when she was found locked inside the 
trunk of a 1969 Ford Futura that the assailants had abandoned in Wilmington. 
She had been in the car trunk more than 30 hours, according to a sheriff's 
deputy, who said the woman's pounding on the trunk caught the attention of a 
passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
Information from an anonymous tipster to the Signal Hill Police Department led 
investigators Monday to the woman's car and the two suspects, Deputy Detta 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the abduction occurred after the woman drove off the 605 Freeway 
at the Imperial Highway exit and got out of her car.

10-MONTH WAR ON MEDFLY ON WESTSIDE DECLARED WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took more than 10 months of spraying, a billion-plus sterile fruit flies and 
$2 million, but authorities announced Monday that they have finally defeated 
the Medfly invasion of West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not detected any additional fruit flies," said Leon Spaugy, the 
agricultural commissioner for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year after the discovery of 48 Mediterranean fruit flies prompted 
federal, state and local officials to launch an eradication campaign, the 
quarantine was lifted on a 76-square-mile area that includes Hollywood, West 
Los Angeles, Culver City and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last October, state officials released about 1.2 billion sterile flies 
to breed with fertile flies -- producing no offspring. Officials waited for 10 
months (a period which encompasses three fly life cycles) before concluding 
that the flies were eradicated. During that period, the pesticide malathion was 
also sprayed from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The "key to killing them off," Spaugy said, was an "early knockdown" before the 
flies -- which prey on more than 250 kinds of produce -- could establish 
themselves on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the potential for a serious widespread infestation," Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
To limit the spread of the fly, officials banned the transport of produce. 
Street vendors were asked to agree in writing to the restrictions, but Spaugy 
said they were less than diligent troops in the war on the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
At least half of the 239 fruit vendors who congregate on city streets and near 
highway on-ramps violated the quarantine, Spaugy said. Nearly 13,000 pounds of 
citrus fruit and other varieties were confiscated from the vendors. Another 
10,000 pounds were seized from the region's 500 grocery stores and farmers 
markets, which are larger and serve many more customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Pest 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success of the Medfly eradication, the ash whitefly, a more robust 
insect, has infested large parts of Southern California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy says the ash whitefly "doesn't have the potential for being as much as a 
problem" because it attacks a smaller array of plants. Nevertheless, the 
whitefly will be much harder to eradicate because it has already infected large 
areas. Also, Spaugy said, pesticides are ineffective against the whitefly, 
which infests quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very mobile insect," Spaugy said. "It's a hitchhiker."

It used to be The Hump, something very special in old railroad usage. 
</P>
<P>
It was literally a hump with a single track ascending one side, then splitting 
into 64 spurs, like the veins of a leaf, as it descended the other. It was 
Southern Pacific's train factory where long trains were broken up and their 
cars reassembled into other trains, depending on their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Men separated the cars as they came up The Hump. Other men, manipulating hand 
and foot controls in towers overhead, guided them down the right tracks, 
relying on their eyes and coordination to lock the hundred-ton vehicles 
together with a feather touch. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny misjudgments could be heard as resonating booms that spread from the 
Taylor Yard on the bank of the Los Angeles River into the hills of Elysian Park 
on one side and Mt. Washington on the other. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, The Hump fell silent. It had become obsolete. Southern Pacific 
transferred train-building to a computer-controlled yard near San Bernardino. 
Last summer, Southern Pacific unceremoniously removed the track for salvage. 
</P>
<P>
So now, The Hump has been transformed into something special in modern 
metropolitan usage: real estate. There are 150 acres of it, within five miles 
of City Hall. In its usually guarded way, Southern Pacific has let out the word 
that it's now for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer needed for railroad purposes," said Southern Pacific spokesman 
Jerry Pera. "That's the way we say it. Does that mean we would like to sell it? 
Yeah, probably we would." 
</P>
<P>
The Taylor Yard is the largest piece of land so close to downtown to hit the 
market since at least World War II. Actually, it is not just a single piece of 
land, but the largest in a chain of turn-of-the century railroad holdings that 
hug the river from Chinatown to Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
First is the Cornfield, Southern Pacific's retired yard for those aptly named 
piggyback trains made of flatcars carrying trailer-trucks. Then the Bull Ring, 
a switching yard. Last is Taylor Yard, filling the curves between the river and 
San Fernando Road all the way to the Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In all, it is 200 acres of nearly reclaimed open space. Its development, 
whether as industry, commerce or housing, would completely reshape the prewar 
communities along the river. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be simple. 
</P>
<P>
Within the area are holdovers from the old days, such as the swath taken up by 
Southern Pacific's main line along San Fernando Road and the huge locomotive 
repair shop on the east end of the Taylor Yard. Both remain in use, at least 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is the question of how badly the earth under the 500 miles of 
former track has been poisoned by industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
Pera concedes that 80 years of railroading have left their mark, but thinks 
that any polluted dirt could be scraped away. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the political tilt. Councilwoman Gloria Molina, whose 1st 
District holds all that land, would like its development to proceed 
deliberately. She has asked the Los Angeles City Planning Department to study a 
planned community of low-income housing and schools on the Cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will take time to complete. In the meantime, The Hump is up for grabs. 
There have been queries, but no golden offer, Pera said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when you deal with that kind of real estate, you don't have people 
banging on your doors." DOUG SMITH

EXXON WANTS TO TOW VALDEZ TO SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid assurances that the trip will be safe, Exxon officials announced Monday 
that they intend to tow to San Diego next month the oil tanker that ran aground 
off the Alaskan coast in March, causing the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank J. Iarossi said the Exxon Valdez will be 
brought from Alaska to undergo $25 million in repairs at the National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding Co. yard on San Diego Bay where the Valdez was built in 
1986. Nassco President Richard Vortmann said the job will take about nine 
months and will create 300 new jobs at the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are expected to repair an area in the ship's hull 700 feet long and 100 
feet wide, Iarossi said, which will require 3,000 tons of steel, about 10% of 
the ship's total steel weight. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the environmental concerns caused by the ship that spilled 11 
million gallons of oil when it struck a reef and polluted about 730 miles of 
shoreline in pristine Prince William Sound, Iarossi went to unusual lengths to 
offer assurances that the Valdez is now "environmentally safe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Truly Sorry' 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi began a press conference by saying that "we at Exxon are truly sorry 
for the circumstances that led to today's announcement." He said that both the 
outside and inside of the ship have been cleaned and all remaining oil removed 
from the tanks, clearing the way for towing of the ship to the Nassco yard. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past two months, we have been very active in clearing the oil residue 
from the tanks and exterior of the vessel," said Iarossi, who said that the 
Coast Guard has inspected the ship and certified that there is no oil in the 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Bill Ball, Coast Guard spokesman in Valdez, said that the ship's 
tanks "are fairly clean" and added that Coast Guard officials are currently 
reviewing Exxon's request for a permit to tow the vessel to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Safe Transit' 
</P>
<P>
"We have not approved a permit for the vessel to proceed just yet. . . . We're 
concerned that there is a safe transit with no chance for pollution," Ball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they expect to get towing approval later this month, and 
it will take four tugs about 20 days to tow the Valdez during the 2,500-mile 
trip. The tugs will follow a course that will keep the Valdez at least 100 
miles offshore, Iarossi said. The Valdez will not fire up its engines during 
the trip, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In Anchorage, meanwhile, the former captain of the Exxon Valdez pleaded 
innocent Monday to Alaska felony charges of criminal mischief stemming from the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all three counts of second-degree criminal mischief, Joseph 
Hazelwood could face up to 15 years in jail and $150,000 in fines.

A legal fight over Colorado River water ended in a 4-4 deadlock at the Supreme 
Court on Monday, leaving intact a controversial, 11-year-old order from the 
U.S. Department of the Interior that resulted in increased allocations of water 
to three Indian reservations along the river. 
</P>
<P>
The states of Arizona and California had been joined by the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California and the Coachella Valley Water District in 
California in opposing the extra allocations to the reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The water in dispute -- 104,000 acre-feet per year -- is enough to supply 
500,000 people in Southern California, according to the water district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Share of Water 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987 ruled that the Department of the 
Interior correctly added 3,500 acres to the reservations, an action that had 
the effect of increasing the reservations' share of water from the Colorado 
River. 
</P>
<P>
State and water district officials said the adjustment of the reservations' 
boundaries illegally deprived them of their fair share of Colorado River water. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court agreed last year to hear the case. Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
who was the U.S. solicitor general when the court heard an earlier version of 
this dispute, recused himself Monday, thus prompting the tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This just means more delays. We may end up going back to the Supreme Court 
anyway," said Washington lawyer Jerome C. Muys, who represented the water 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Master 
</P>
<P>
The water districts and the states can still directly ask the Supreme Court to 
appoint a special master to study the issue, hear arguments from both sides and 
issue a ruling, much as it would in a dispute between two states. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has not actually deprived Californians of water, officials said. 
Arizona has not been using its full allotment of water from the river, so the 
MWD has been able to get all it is seeking. But that may change due to 
continuing growth in Arizona, according to lawyers, which could make the 
dispute over the Indians' water crucial for the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians say they need extra water to make their reservations economically 
viable.

Arco Announces Test Results: Atlantic Richfield announced that a test oil well 
on Alaska's North Slope confirmed the presence of a "promising" amount of oil 
in a field about two miles from Prudhoe Bay. The test well produced as much as 
5,350 barrels of oil per day, more than twice the 2,500 barrels per day from a 
well drilled late last year. Spokesman Al Greenstein would not speculate on the 
size of the field until results come from another test well now being drilled. 
The field was first announced by Arco and partners Exxon and BP Exploration in 
February.

Winter Wheat Production Hits 11-Year Low: The Agriculture Department said 1989 
winter wheat production is estimated at an 11-year low of 1.41 billion bushels, 
down 10% from last year's harvest of 1.56 billion bushels. Further, the 
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said prospects for this year's 
harvest were down 2% from the May estimate of 1.43 billion bushels. Officials 
said the average yield, based on indications as of June 1, was estimated at 
34.5 bushels per acre, compared to 34.9 bushels estimated in May and last 
year's average of 39.2 bushels per acre.

AMERICAN STORES LAMENTS DELAY IN LUCKY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Stores officials maintained Monday that grocery shoppers are suffering 
because of the protracted legal action that is barring the merger of Alpha Beta 
and Lucky Stores, the company's two California grocery chains. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the worst case is what we've got right now," said Jonathan L. Scott, 
vice chairman and chief executive of the Salt Lake City-based company, the 
nation's largest operator of food chains and drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
By operating the chains separately, he said, the company is unable to take 
advantage of cost savings in advertising, distribution, warehousing and 
manufacturing that American Stores has said would be passed on to customers in 
the form of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
If allowed by the courts, the company intends to merge the two operations under 
the Lucky banner and adopt that company's low-price policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to lower shelf costs by approximately $50 million," he told 
shareholders at the company's annual meeting at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The statements reiterated a stance the company has held during its long battle 
with California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, who last Sept. 1 sued to challenge 
the company's purchase of Lucky on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has contended that a merger of the two big chains would reduce 
competition and force prices up. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31, a three-judge panel for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco reversed a lower court's preliminary injunction that prohibited 
the integration of the two chains. The Attorney General's office immediately 
requested that the case be heard by an 11-judge panel of the court. 
</P>
<P>
The case is still under consideration by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court.

McDonnell Douglas Gets 4 Big Orders: McDonnell Douglas said it has received 
orders and commitments from four airlines for a total of 60 new MD-80 
twin-jets. Alitalia, of Italy, one of the largest MD-80 operators in the world, 
placed 25 orders and 25 options, McDonnell Douglas said. Deliveries are 
scheduled to begin in 1993 and continue through 1997. Minerve, a charter 
airline based in Paris, took options on two MD-83s, scheduled for 1994 
delivery. Transwede, of Sweden, made two options firm and took options on an 
additional four MD-83s. Also, Paris-based Air Liberte placed two orders for 
MD-83s, with delivery scheduled in March, 1991.

California Federal Changes Name: California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 
one of the nation's largest thrifts, has changed its name to California Federal 
Bank, reflecting an increasing homogenization of financial services offered by 
banks and thrifts. Several of the state's largest savings and loans now call 
themselves banks, including Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills and First 
Nationwide Bank in San Francisco. The name change "clearly recognizes the 
evolution of the financial services industry along common lines," said John R. 
Torell III, California Federal's chief executive.

SECURITY PACIFIC BIDS FOR 2 TEXAS BANKING FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. said Monday that it is bidding for two large, ailing 
Texas banking companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles banking company said it has submitted a proposal to the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire the subsidiary banks of Texas American 
Bancshares in Ft. Worth and National Bancshares in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for creating a single 64-branch Texas bank through a 
government assistance package in which the FDIC would assume the risks of 
existing bad loans, said Robert H. Smith, president and chief executive of 
Security Pacific Bank, the company's principal subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The two Texas banking companies have combined assets of about $7 billion. They 
had losses totaling $700 million in 1988, largely because of severe problems 
with real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which regulates banks and insures deposits, has been seeking a single 
buyer for the two banks for more than a year. Monday was the deadline for 
submitting bids. 
</P>
<P>
An FDIC spokesman in Washington said the agency is evaluating several 
proposals. The only other bidder identified by the spokesman was Minneapolis 
businessman Carl Pohlad, but some Texans are also reported to have submitted 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Weeks' Study 
</P>
<P>
A team from Security Pacific has been examining the Texas banks for several 
weeks. Smith said in an interview that details of the offer depend on how the 
FDIC handles taking over the 64 separate banks that form the Texas holding 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said, however, that existing bad loans would be switched to a separate 
new institution. The FDIC would provide funds to cover all losses, and Security 
Pacific would manage the "bad" bank's loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement would leave Security Pacific with a healthy operation that 
would focus on consumers and small and medium-sized businesses, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the losses can be defined as someone else's, we will take the remaining 
portfolio," he said. "We think it can be very attractive, and we can compete 
very well. There is a lot of efficiency to be gained and a lot of creative 
products that can be provided." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Anderson, a bank analyst at Stephens Inc., a regional brokerage firm in 
Little Rock, Ark., said, "Security Pacific can see, as others have, that Texas 
is the third-largest market in the country and won't stay depressed forever." 
</P>
<P>
Pohlad agreed last year to take over the two Texas banks in a deal that 
required $475 million in FDIC assistance. But after examining the books, Pohlad 
found the banks to be in worse shape than he had expected and withdrew the 
offer. Sources have said he wants at least $875 million in federal assistance 
and other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific, which owns banks in six Western states, made an unsuccessful 
offer for InterFirst, a big Dallas bank, two years ago. Security Pacific also 
had been considered a potential bidder for 20 MCorp banks in Texas that were 
taken over by regulators this year and put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extension of California' 
</P>
<P>
"This would be a natural extension of California," said Thomas H. Hanley, 
banking analyst with the New York investment firm of Salomon Bros. "Security 
Pacific is bidding on what in the old days were viewed as two very good banks." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Texas energy and real estate markets has reduced that 
state's banking industry to rubble. Out-of-state banks, including First 
Interstate of Los Angeles, have already acquired most of the other big Texas 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Texas American and National Bancshares, along with the pending sale 
of the 20 MCorp banks, will conclude the federal auction of big Texas banks.

Movie Tickets Shoot to $7.50: A major movie theater chain said it will charge 
$7.50 a ticket on weekends in its Manhattan theaters, a new national high for 
film admissions. Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto-based chain that owns six theater 
complexes in New York and New Jersey, said the $7.50 admission price will be in 
effect Friday nights and all day Saturday and Sunday. The price represents an 
increase of 50 cents a ticket, or 7.14% -- less than the 8.3% increase in the 
consumer price index for the same period in New York, according to a Cineplex 
statement. Film admissions in most American cities range from $5 to $7.

CANON TO INVEST $100 MILLION IN NEXT INC., GET SEAT ON BOARD

Canon Inc. of Japan has agreed to invest $100 million in Next Inc., the 
brainchild of computer pioneer Steven Jobs, to acquire one-sixth of the 
privately held 4-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives Next a hefty financial boost just as it gets set to begin 
volume shipments of its sleek, black computer workstations. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will erase anybody's worries about Next's long-term financial 
stability, its ability to invest in (research and development) and in 
manufacturing," Jobs told a group of reporters and industry analysts before a 
tour of the company's automated factory in Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of Canon's agreement are essentially the same as those negotiated 
with H. Ross Perot when he invested $20 million in the company in 1987. Canon 
will receive a seat on the board of directors of the company and has agreed not 
to acquire more than 20% of the firm for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Canon's investment was widely expected, most rumors speculated that 
Canon would invest $20 million in the company. 
</P>
<P>
But Canon's agreement does not include any technology licenses or manufacturing 
rights -- a point Jobs stressed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Very Difficult Market 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Canon also acquired the right to sell Next's computers 
in Asia as part of the $100-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The distribution agreement opens a big market for Next, but the Japanese 
market has been very difficult for U.S. vendors," said analyst William Lempesis 
of Dataquest.

MAXICARE WINS RULING ON ITS HMO STATUS IN 3 STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for beleaguered Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a federal court in 
Santa Ana has denied regulators in three states jurisdiction over the company's 
subsidiaries that are operating under bankruptcy law protection. 
</P>
<P>
The states -- Arizona, Louisiana and Texas -- had asked the court to dismiss 
several Maxicare health maintenance organizations from proceedings under 
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, arguing that the HMOs in those 
states operate as domestic insurance companies. The Bankruptcy Code precludes 
domestic insurance companies from filing under Chapter 11. The states argued 
that they -- rather than the federal bankruptcy courts -- should oversee the 
reorganization of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
The rulings are important developments in Los Angeles-based Maxicare's favor. 
The company has been seeking to preserve as much as possible of its former 
nationwide network of health maintenance organizations since it filed on March 
16 for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11. Although state 
regulators said they had the expertise to rehabilitate the Maxicare HMOs, some 
industry sources speculated that the states would liquidate the units to pay 
claims owed to Maxicare members and health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
A backlog of past-due debts to providers was among the reasons Maxicare gave 
for filing under Chapter 11 and including nearly all of its operating units in 
the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Specifically Excluded' 
</P>
<P>
Although the three rulings by U.S. District Court Judge John J. Wilson were 
specifically in response to petitions filed by Arizona, Louisiana and Texas, 
the judge's orders seemed to indicate that he is inclined to rule in Maxicare's 
favor on similar pending motions filed by Illinois, Indiana and Ohio 
regulators. Wilson's orders were signed Friday and distributed to parties in 
the case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare argued vigorously that its HMOs are not insurance companies for 
purposes of bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
"This court finds that HMOs are eligible for bankruptcy relief since they are 
not specifically excluded by Section 109" of the Bankruptcy Code, Wilson said 
in his order. "It may be presumed that Congress was aware of the existence of 
HMOs when the code was enacted in 1978. For example, in 1973, Congress passed 
federal HMO legislation 'to provide assistance and encouragement for the 
establishment and expansion of health maintenance organizations.' From the 
failure to include HMOs, it may be inferred that Congress intended to make them 
eligible for bankruptcy relief." 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare has about 625,000 members, down from about 900,000 at the time of the 
bankruptcy law filing and less than half its peak membership in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the court ruling, a Maxicare spokesman said: "Obviously, we're 
pleased. Regardless of these decisions, we want to keep working with each state 
regulator for the benefit of our members." 
</P>
<P>
The state regulators couldn't be reached for comment.

Paramount virtually took over the box office last weekend as ticket sales for 
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" broke the $100-million mark, and "Star 
Trek V: The Final Frontier" opened to sales of nearly $17.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
While "Star Trek V" took in more dollars than any of its predecessors, roughly 
300,000 fewer moviegoers bought tickets for this installment than for "Star 
Trek IV" in 1986. Ticket price inflation of more than 11% since 1986 accounts 
for "Star Trek V's" higher grosses. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek V," which was directed by William Shatner -- known to millions of 
moviegoers and TV watchers as "Captain Kirk" -- faced stiff competition from 
Paramount's own "Indiana Jones." During just 19 days in the nation's theaters, 
"Indiana Jones," starring Harrison Ford, has grossed $102.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Theater owners predict that "Indiana Jones" is the first of what could be as 
many as half a dozen blockbuster films to break the $100 million mark this 
summer. Last summer, only four films reached that level of ticket sales. That 
summer's top-grossing film, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" grossed $125 million for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Below the cannon fire of these blockbuster wars, however, a handful of films 
aimed at older audiences could also enjoy healthy business this summer. One of 
those movies is Disney's "Dead Poets Society," a Peter Weir-directed drama 
about boys at a regimented prep school and the eccentric poetry teacher (Robin 
Williams) who enters their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" attracted ticket sales of $7.5 million over the weekend, 
even though it played in only 687 theaters. "As far as counter-programming 
goes, Disney did a super job," said James Tharp, senior vice president of the 
1,300 theater General Cinema chain. 
</P>
<P>
While Tharp said he had expected the film to do well in a few select markets, 
such as New York and Los Angeles, he was "pleasantly surprised" to find that it 
is drawing a much broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp predicted another sleeper will hit the screens in August: Fox's "Weekend 
at Bernie's." 
</P>
<P>
Also last weekend, Cinecom's satiric comedy "Scenes From the Class Struggle in 
Beverly Hills" enjoyed a healthy $15,719 per screen at eight theaters in major 
cities. This weekend, Columbia's "Ghostbusters II" opens, followed the next 
week by Warners' "Batman," both of which theater owners expect to become big 
hits (the first "Ghostbusters" grossed $181.7 million during the summer of 
1984). In July, Warners also releases "Lethal Weapon 2." 
</P>
<P>
The opening for Fox's "Abyss" has been moved back to August, but theater owners 
are expecting big business on that film as well.

NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM CANCELS GALA FOR OPENING OF CHINA EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural history has canceled a gala party 
originally scheduled for Friday night's opening of a new exhibit of fossils 
from China, billed as the most comprehensive such display ever shown outside of 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
But the exhibit, "From the Land of Dragons," will open Saturday for its 
full-scheduled run through Oct. 15, the museum said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Black, the museum's director, said the party was canceled "in light of 
the events in China and the loss of life there." Black said the fossil exhibit 
is part of an ongoing museum exchange with China. 
</P>
<P>
The museum said the future of the exchange program has been cast in doubt by 
the current crisis in China. Black said he ordered the party canceled because 
he was "saddened and shocked by the action of the Chinese government taken 
against its students and peaceful demonstrators in Beijing and elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will include fossils of dinosaurs and flying reptiles. It includes 
42 specimens, of both carnivorous and plant-eating species. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit was accompanied by four Chinese scholars from the Beijing Institute 
of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. The four are installing the 
displays in the Exposition Park museum. The Natural History Museum said the 
four would remain in Los Angeles until June 18, as scheduled.

HIGH-RISES SWAY AS TWIN QUAKES RATTLE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brief but intense earthquakes whipsawed across central Los Angeles County 
within 25 minutes of each other Monday morning, causing cosmetic damage to 
buildings, triggering precautionary evacuations of schools and some offices and 
slightly injuring two people. 
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt across much of the Southland, with worried residents from as 
far south as San Clemente calling local police and fire officials, but no 
significant damage was reported in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The initial quake and its aftershock were almost equally strong. Caltech 
seismologist Kate Hutton said the first shock, at 9:57 a.m., had a magnitude of 
4.5, and lasted about five seconds. The second, at 10:22 a.m., registered a 
magnitude of 4.3. 
</P>
<P>
Both were along the same Elysian Park Fault line responsible for the 5.9 
Whittier quake in October, 1987, that killed three people and caused about $360 
million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was fixed eight miles beneath Montebello. The twin jolts wrenched 
the city especially hard along the spine of the deep-seated Elysian Park Fault, 
which extends from Whittier through East Los Angeles, downtown, Hollywood, 
Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton said it was "uncommon, but not rare" for similar-size quakes to occur so 
closely, and added that it presaged "a continuing series of small aftershocks." 
Jones said only a 1% to 2% chance remains that the quakes were foreshocks of a 
larger quake within the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's main quake was the sixth temblor of magnitude 4.5 or greater in the 
immediate Los Angeles area in less than two years -- the most in such a time 
period since detailed records began 60 years ago, according to Lucile Jones of 
the U.S. Geological Survey. Five of those have been along various parts of the 
Elysian Park Fault, which was unknown until two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the usual unnerving accompaniment of splintering glass, cracking 
plaster, cascading ceiling tiles and jangling burglar alarms, the quakes' toll 
on people and property was slight. 
</P>
<P>
But at least two minor casualties were recorded: a woman at a downtown court 
building, hit by a falling acoustic ceiling tile, and a Ward Elementary School 
student in Downey who, in her zeal to follow safety measures, banged her head 
as she dived under her desk, and needed stitches to close the cut over her eye. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, identified as Cecilia Ortega, 42, of West Covina, was hit by an 
acoustic tile from the sixth-floor hallway ceiling of the Superior Courts 
building. She was treated for back and neck pain at the Hospital of the Good 
Samaritan and released Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, the shakers set high-rises swaying. Some of 475 
construction workers at the 73-story Library Tower -- still under construction 
and the tallest building on the West Coast, built to withstand an 8.3 quake -- 
scrambled to watch from a parking lot as the tower swayed "noticeably" after 
the shaking stopped. 
</P>
<P>
For drywall worker Don Shephard, who stayed put on the 65th floor, 850 feet up, 
it was lively as a carnival ride: "It was a thrill. . . . I rather enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
The city's emergency operations center was open for only 90 minutes; there was 
little for them to do after initial damage assessments. Inspections and 
helicopter flyovers by government agencies and utilities found the area's 
systems -- highways, bridges, dams and electricity, gas and water facilities -- 
undamaged. A supervisor working in a 60-foot-deep Metro Rail tunnel downtown 
said he thought only that "a big bus or truck came by." 
</P>
<P>
Many telephones in Montebello, the epicenter, were out for well over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuations were precautionary, and brief. About 2,500 people were moved out of 
the State Office Building downtown for about two hours. The 22 downtown 
Municipal Courts and city halls in Montebello, Downey and Compton were 
evacuated while buildings were examined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dash to Exits 
</P>
<P>
One unintended evacuation: About 50 people at a Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors budget hearing, who, in spite of Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's urgings 
to "stay calm, everybody," sprinted for the exits when the quake shook loose 
some ceiling tiles. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
followed earthquake drill procedures, spending an hour or so out on athletic 
fields and playgrounds. Downey and Montebello students were also sent outside 
briefly, district officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
At Breed Elementary School in East Los Angeles, it was the second jolt, not the 
first, that terrified. Children were out on the playground when it struck, and 
many hit the ground. Several youngsters began crying, "Not again . . . not this 
again." A fifth-grader fainted and was revived after about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And about 30 parents, many of them survivors of killer earthquakes in El 
Salvador and Nicaragua, descended on the school to take their children home. 
"At least I'll know that my child is with me at home," said Avelina Molina, 
signing papers allowing her 9-year-old daughter to go home. "I trust the school 
(officials) but they have no control over what God orders." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's quake was not felt nearly as sharply in Orange County as an April 7 
temblor centered under Newport Beach of 4.6 intensity. That quake rattled 
through much of the central county, cracked buildings, caused several school 
closings and frightened even natives because of the severity of its shaking. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of that jolt was on the minds of some local residents Monday. Todd 
Wulffson, a lawyer with the firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers, was in his 17th-floor 
office in Newport Beach when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got this big old desk, and it moved sideways," Wulffson said. "Everything 
kind of moves back and forth when the Santa Ana winds blow and during 
earthquakes. . . . We're kind of used to them by now -- that's what's scary." 
</P>
<P>
Marilee Miller, acting manager of the Emergency Management Division, the 
county's disaster nerve center, said no damage was reported from the quake and 
its aftershocks. But as a precaution, county officials activated the emergency 
broadcast system and issued a bulletin to local radio stations announcing that 
a quake had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, a woman who tried to shut off the natural gas line to her house 
after the quake got more than she bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
When Nancy Johnson rushed outside of her home in the 1300 block of West Ash 
Avenue to turn off the gas, the valve came off, causing a loud pop that could 
be heard for several blocks. As gas spewed into the air, neighbors left their 
homes and gas company workers and firefighters rushed to the scene to plug the 
valve and make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no injuries, no fire and no damage," Fullerton city spokeswoman 
Sylvia Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Southland, residents and businesses reported the standard recitation 
of inanimate casualties that accompany such moderate-size shakers: A fallen 
wine rack and "the usual jars of pickles" at a Vons market in El Monte; broken 
windows at a video store and shoe store along Brooklyn Avenue in East Los 
Angeles, at a Bank of America building downtown, and at a gas company building 
in Pico Rivera; a high school classroom trailer off its base in Downey; a 
slight earthslide on Soto Street in El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
A tractor-trailer rig eastbound on the San Bernardino Freeway near the 
intersection with the Long Beach freeway tipped over in the jolting, according 
to Los Angeles County fire officials. The driver was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
The only buildings with anything close to major damage were commercial 
buildings in Whittier that already were condemned as a result of the 1987 quake 
and are awaiting demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Most residents seemed to handle it just as sturdily: 
</P>
<P>
A man and woman trapped for an hour in a stalled elevator in the eight-story 
Beverly Tower, a senior citizens residence in Montebello, waited calmly until 
rescuers arrived. "I told them they should have had a deck of cards," said Fire 
Capt. Orville Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Gem dealer Jacques Mouw, president of Interdiam, was in his 16th-floor office 
polishing two substantial diamonds of eight and four carats -- and together 
worth "in the high six figures" -- when the quake hit. With the wheel spinning 
at 6,000 r.p.m. "a jolt like that" could have cracked the stones. It didn't. 
"I'm calm," he declared. "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
Even in Whittier, still recovering economically and emotionally from the trauma 
of 1987, reaction bordered on the blase. In Central Park, a woman watching her 
children play on the swings shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
"We run outside, then we go back inside," she said. "What's new?"

O.C. DELEGATION LEANS TOWARD AIR PLAN

The Bush Administration's plan to clean the nation's air appears to blend 
enough elements of flexibility with traditional government regulation to 
satisfy Orange County's conservative members of Congress, whose districts are 
smothered by some of the worst air in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The recognition that we have to move (on the issue of air pollution) is so 
profound . . . that I'm hopeful that before the end of the year, we'll be 
gathered for a bill-signing ceremony at the White House," said Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), the senior member of the county's delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Support from the county's Republican representatives is an encouraging sign for 
the President, according to one Orange County lobbyist, because it suggests 
that Bush's pollution-control plan may not run into stiff opposition from 
lawmakers who traditionally fight proposals for increased government regulation 
and expensive government initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying Group 
</P>
<P>
"The more nonpartisan you can make an issue, the greater the chances that it 
will move ahead," said Thane A. Young, an associate of the Ferguson Co. The 
Washington-based lobbying group represents the Irvine Co. and the city of Santa 
Ana, among other clients. 
</P>
<P>
However, Young and others noted that the politics of air pollution has often 
depended more on local air quality than on political ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer acknowledged that the air-pollution package that emerges from 
Congress may not strongly resemble the one outlined by the President on Monday. 
But he said the final plan is likely to retain many elements of the Bush 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Bush plan would reduce by 40% the standard for tailpipe 
emissions of hydrocarbons, which help create ozone, a major ingredient in smog. 
</P>
<P>
But it would also allow auto manufacturers and refinery operators to determine 
for themselves how best to meet overall standards for pollution reduction set 
by the federal government. In addition, industrial polluters would be required 
to use the "best-available technology" to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would extend to the year 2010 the deadline for meeting federal air 
quality standards for Orange County and the Los Angeles basin, which together 
constitute one of the nation's most heavily polluted areas. Under amendments to 
the Clean Air Act passed in 1977, the region was to have met pollution 
standards by the end of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a reasonableness in this bill that didn't appear in past bills," said 
Brian Bennett, chief of staff for Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Other clean-air proposals, such as a recent bill proposed by Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), "caused conservatives who are worried about the 
environment to say, 'We need a more flexible approach to avoid scaring off new 
businesses and closing existing businesses,' " Bennett added. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), the only Orange County 
representative to co-sponsor the Waxman bill, said Packard believes that 
elements of both the Bush and Waxman plans merit consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman embraces the idea that something needs to be done, whether 
it's Waxman's plan or the President's plan," said David R. DuBose, Packard's 
press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer and Dornan had both opposed Waxman's bill because they believed that 
its proposed sanctions were too strict. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be a part of a law that is so stringent in its application 
that that we're saying to the people of Southern California: 'You're not going 
to be able to hook up any new water meters,' which stops growth, or, 'You're 
denied your pro-rata share of highway funds,' " Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backed by Environmentalists 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have argued that such strong measures are needed if Southern 
California's skies are ever to be clear of smog. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, before Bush's plan was unveiled, Rep. C. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach) called for the Administration to create financial 
incentives akin to some of those outlined Monday by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to generally mandate industrywide reductions in pollution and 
allow firms more flexibility to meet the standards," Cox said. "As a matter of 
general philosophy, it is important that the government take an active role in 
controlling air pollution. The best way for the government to do that is to try 
to use market forces rather than to thwart them." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) declined comment on the Bush plan, saying that 
he and his staff wanted to study it before making any statement.

2 KILLED ON FREEWAY AS CAR GOES OUT OF CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Santa Ana men were killed when their car hit the concrete center divider of 
the Orange Freeway, slid through four lanes of southbound traffic, spun out of 
control, then came to a stop when it struck a tree, a California Highway Patrol 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokesman Matt Clark identified the men killed shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday 
as Ricardo Guzman, 21, and Jose Luis Cruz, 20, who was driving the Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
They were pronounced dead at the scene, Clark said, adding that it appeared 
that both were under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Two passengers in the car were treated at Brea Community Hospital for minor 
injuries, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said a witness told the CHP that the men were following his car too 
closely just north of Birch Street when Cruz abruptly changed lanes, then hit 
the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz's car did not strike any other vehicles as it bounced back through the 
four lanes of traffic and eventually hit the tree.

ATTACK WAS A FAMILY AFFAIR, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy who tried to cite a repeat offender for a leash-law 
violation got into a scuffle with an entire family, including a 79-year-old 
woman who hit the officer with a shoe, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Rivas said a couple he identified as Jack Ketchum, 59, and his wife, 
Neill Brazelton Ketchum, 48, were arrested Sunday on charges of assault on an 
officer and resisting arrest near 4th Street and Pacific Coast Highway after 
they refused to cooperate with the deputy over the leash violation. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman's mother, 79-year-old, Perry Brazelton, was not arrested, even 
though she took part in pummeling the officer, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The leash law was the original thing," Rivas said. "Then he (Ketchum) resisted 
arrest and assaulted the officer. Then the wife also got involved in assaulting 
the officer and resisting him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The mother-in-law is listed as a suspect in the incident because she was also 
hitting the officer with a shoe." 
</P>
<P>
"But she was not taken to the County Jail, due to her age, I'm speculating," he 
said. "It will be up to the district attorney's office to file any criminal 
charges against her."

OCTD PUTS 67 REPAIRED BUSES BACK INTO SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All 67 Orange County Transit District buses recalled on May 4 for repair of 
cracked suspensions were back in service as of Monday, with transit officials 
planning to fine the manufacturer $145,700. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD spokeswoman Joanne Curran said the buses were phased back into service 
gradually rather than all at once, with most back in service last week. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no loss of service, and we anticipate no loss in revenue to the 
district," said Curran. However, she said, OCTD maintenance crews worked an 
undetermined amount of overtime to keep other buses rolling, and the district 
will absorb that expense. 
</P>
<P>
Curran said Hayward-based Gillig Corp. paid for reinforcing a bracket 
underneath the rear suspension of the buses, although the district does not 
know how much the repairs cost. 
</P>
<P>
Curran said the fine of $145,700 was based on a rate of $100 per day for each 
bus that was out of service. The bill has not been mailed yet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig Corp. officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The buses were pulled out of service after two rate rear-end suspension 
collapses with passengers aboard. The passengers were transferred to other 
vehicles while the damaged buses were towed away.

HIGH COURT DECLINES ANAHEIM MAN'S JOB-BIAS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court, having staked out a civil-rights position that critics 
say is hostile to affirmative action, on Monday rejected an Orange County man's 
last bid to show that the county denied him several jobs because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment, the Supreme Court refused to hear a final appeal by Kenneth 
Robinson, 47, of Anaheim. That lets stand a 1987 ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals that found no evidence to support Robinson's claim that the 
county refused to hire him for any of four open professional positions because 
he was black. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came in the wake of a string of major Supreme Court decisions this 
year -- including one Monday involving firefighters in Birmingham, Ala. -- that 
civil rights activists say combine to make it far tougher for minority workers 
to show workplace discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled to see that we've prevailed in the Superior Court," Michael 
Adams, an Orange County personnel manager, said in an interview. "I'd like to 
say that this charge was so clearly unfounded that we always knew we'd prevail, 
but these things are always up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"This should prove that our hiring procedures are aboveboard and that the 
county is working very hard to achieve parity in the ethnic makeup of its 
workplace," Adams added. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson, who has a law degree and is now unemployed, pointed to the 
Supreme Court's refusal to honor his appeal as another example of a 
conservative court that has backed away from the civil rights advances of 
decades past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Robinson moved to Orange County for the sake of his wife's job 
transfer and applied for four jobs with the county in professional investigator 
and examiner positions -- one in Superior Court, another in the Social Services 
Agency, and two in the Community Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Turned down for all four openings, he claimed in a federal lawsuit that county 
officials, despite their assertions to the contrary, knew that he was black 
from his job application. 
</P>
<P>
And he pointed as evidence of a broader racial bias to what he said was a 
complete absence of even a single male black employee at that time in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The county countered with statistics on its female black employees, persuading 
a federal court judge to throw out the claim altogether before it got to trial. 
</P>
<P>
And the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, rejecting Robinson's claim of an 
under-represented black-male work force, asserted in its 1987 decision that: 
"There is clearly no racial discriminatory impact on blacks as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Patterson, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund in Los Angeles, who represented Robinson in his appeal, said that in light 
of the Supreme Court's other recent civil-rights cases, "this result is 
certainly not a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
But he and attorneys for the county cautioned against drawing any broader legal 
interpretations from the court's decision not to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
"They take the cases that they want to take, and you can't read much into 
that," said Robert C. Carlson, an Orange lawyer who defended the county in the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Robinson, however, lashed out at the decision's implications, 
saying: "It just seems that everybody in this country constitutes a class (in 
the area of equal employment practices) except black men, and that's now 
unfortunately the law of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"From slavery times, people have hired black women, but they don't want the 
black men. It's a slave mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Administrator Alan Slater deemed Robinson's claims of racial 
bias "preposterous and groundless." As with all hirings, court officials who 
reviewed Robinson's 1983 application never knew his race, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
County affirmative action officer Ben Alvillar said in an interview that the 
county subscribes to a "voluntary affirmative action" program, meaning that it 
seeks to conduct outreach programs to make up for any "noticeable lack" of 
minority-worker representation but does not use quotas or formulas. 
</P>
<P>
Employee figures provided by Alvillar show that, as of December, 1988, minority 
males made up 11.9% of the total county work force, and minority females 15.9%. 
Minorities showed their highest representation (43.6%) among service 
maintenance workers and their lowest (12.9%) among officials and 
administrators.

INCREASED OCTC OF $11.1 MILLION OKD; IT'S UP 50% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to speed road and commuter-rail improvements in Orange County will cost 
taxpayers more during 1989-90, but county transportation planners decided 
Monday that such projects are worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission adopted an $11.1-million budget 
Monday for 1989-90, up $3.7 million or 50% over spending in the current fiscal 
year ending June 30. Most of the increase is for professional services and 
consultants who are preparing environmental assessment reports on widening 
projects for the Santa Ana and Riverside freeways, as well as development of a 
countywide rail passenger service plan. 
</P>
<P>
The budget discussion revealed that officials are worried about the failure of 
any agency to plan for the expected addition of 50,000 cars per day on the 
northbound San Diego Freeway in Costa Mesa once the San Joaquin Hills tollway 
is built. The tollway, scheduled for completion in the early 1990s, will be an 
extension of the Corona del Mar Freeway and run between San Juan Capistrano and 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The existing transition road from the northbound Corona del Mar Freeway to the 
northbound San Diego Freeway is only one lane. The commission added $200,000 to 
its new budget Monday for environmental studies of plans to correct the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Commission member Dana W. Reed said that construction estimates range from $6 
million to $56 million to "fix" the interchange but that no agency now has the 
money for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developer Fee Increase? 
</P>
<P>
Asked if tollway officials should earmark funds for the interchange, Reed said: 
"They have been discussing raising developer fees (for the tollway), so they 
should take a look at that possibility."

'THE WAR' PRODUCES STALEMATE;

<P>
LEONARD IS DECKED TWICE BY HEARNS BUT GAINS DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Hearns, teetering and tottering at the finish as he was nearly eight 
years ago, survived a furious Sugar Ray Leonard finish this time. 
</P>
<P>
He survived, but he didn't win, as most thought he had. Leonard didn't win, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, they held a $70-million fight Monday night and called it a draw, 
because one judge, Dalby Shirley, couldn't make a decision and called it even. 
Both Hearns and Leonard fought heroically, almost to complete exhaustion, and 
the result was no result. 
</P>
<P>
On a hot night in the desert, a full house of 15,336 in the Caesars Palace 
tennis court stadium booed lustily at the announcement that neither man had 
won. 
</P>
<P>
They also booed because Hearns, who most thought had won a clear decision in 
the super-middleweight bout, had been denied the redemption he sought, after 
waiting nearly eight years. Nearly eight years ago here, Hearns was ahead on 
points when Leonard stopped him in the 14th round. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Hearns put Leonard on the deck twice, in the 3rd and 11th 
rounds, stayed on his feet throughout, and when he survived Leonard's wild 
charge in the 12th and final round, seemed like the winner. 
</P>
<P>
At the final bell, as he sagged on the ropes from Leonard's desperate pounding, 
he stared at Leonard and gave him a bloody, meaningful smile. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's mine, Ray," the smile seemed to say. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that way to nearly everyone, but it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada judge Jerry Roth called it 113-112 for Hearns and Tommy Kaczmarek of New 
Jersey had it 113-112 for Leonard. Then when the ring announcer wnet public 
with Shirley's card, the boos began thundering down from the cheap seats, the 
$100 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Two Times' cards had Hearns winning, 114-112, and 113-111. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard (35-1-1), denied victory for only the second time in his 13-year 
career, seemed on the verge of putting Hearns (46-3-1) away a half-dozen times. 
Yet Hearns remained atop his suspect legs during every crisis, and had Leonard 
in great difficulty several times, too. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard effusively praised Herarns after the exciting, concussive show. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you must understand is the fact that all of a sudden Tommy Hearns 
is a greater fighter than was expected," Leonard said. "The legs were there . . 
. his chin was there. All the attributes you (the media) said were not there, I 
think you should apologize to Tommy. He fought a courageous fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt Tommy Hearns a number of times and he hung in there. He's a tough 
cookie." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, 33, started more slowly than Hearns, 30, and seemed to concede the 
first four rounds to Hearns,30. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns surprised many by not answering the first bell with bombs. Performances 
in his last three bouts indicated that Hearns' legs weren't capable of carrying 
him the distance in a tough contest. On Monday night, they were -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Hearns' knockdown punches were from his right hand, but both seemed to 
catch Leonard off-balance. Other right hands, seemingly thrown with more 
authority, caught Leonard flush in the face and didn't put him down. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns clearly won the first two rounds, then Leonard turned up the heat in the 
third round, trying to counter Hearns' long, snapping jabs. Hearns caught 
Leonard with a big right and Leonard stepped back and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
But the next time Hearns threw the right, it caught Leonard on the side of the 
head and he went down briefly. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the fifth, Leonard seemed ready to finish it. Hearns began the 
round by landing a series of hard, jolting jabs and Leonard chose to remain in 
range, trying to counter. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard caught him with a right-left combination, driving a wobbling Hearns 
into the ropes. In seconds, Leonard had chased Hearns to the other side of the 
ring and was hitting him freely. But Hearns somehow survived and Leonard seemed 
to pay tribute to his courage at the bell, when he tapped Hearns on his heart, 
with his glove. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns showed Leonard early in the sixth that he was by no means calling it a 
night. He whacked Leonard in the ribs with a huge left hook. Leonard leaped 
inside Hearns' longer reach and landed a good jab, and Hearns -- now bleeding 
from a cut inside the mouth -- stuck out a bloody tongue at Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns seemed to have Leonard on the edge of a knockout early in the seventh 
when he cracked him on the jaw with a short, powerful right. Leonard was hurt, 
and hurt even more when Hearns slammed a left hook into Leonard's ribs. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, however, as has been a trademark during his career, Leonard 
cleared his head quickly and resumed his assault. Two body shots landed and he 
then drove Hearns back into the ropes with a combination. Hearns threw a wild 
right hand and when he missed completely, he stumbled awkwardly on the 
overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many thought, Hearns' legs would say good night. 
</P>
<P>
Instead it was Hearns' right hand that departed. Midway through the eighth, he 
caught Leonard flush on the face with a long, straight right, the kind that 
could crack a wall a decade ago. This one, however, didn't faze Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns seemed to be on the verge of victory after the 11th, when he put Leonard 
down, earned a 10-8 round, and on most cards had a lead ranging from two to 
four points going into the last round. 
</P>
<P>
And Leonard, amazingly enough, seemed one round from defeat. But that's how it 
seemed at Leonard-Hearns I, too, when Leonard's desperate 14th round rally 
stopped Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, Hearns wasn't sittiing on a lead, and not backing up. Hearns 
stayed at center-ring and traded heavy blows with Leonard... until Leonard 
caught him with a big right and sent him to the ropes again. 
</P>
<P>
Until the bell sounded, Leonard drove Hearns all over the ring. In one stretch, 
he threw 13 unanswered punches. 
</P>
<P>
And so Hearns survived, a triumph in itself. He had waited nearly eight years, 
and events even in the days before the fight, events seemed to be ganging up on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns' youngest brother, Henry, was charged with first-degree murder by 
Detroit police Monday, after the shooting death of his girlfriend Saturday in a 
Southfield, Mich., home owned by Thomas Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
But no tears will flow for Hearns' not getting what most thought he earned. 
</P>
<P>
The combatants' guarantees for "The War" were $13 million for Leonard and $11 
million for Hearns. But if pay-per-view sales nationwide were as hot as they 
were in Southern California the past 10 days, those numbers could increase to 
$14 million and $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Kulis, the Southern California Leonard-Hearns exhibitor, said at 
mid-afternoon Monday that his 68 Southland cable systems seemed headed to a 
record buy rate for PPV boxing show. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated sales to be at an 11% penetration at 3 p.m. Monday. Late orders, 
he said, would push the final rate well above the record figure, 11.9%, for 
Leonard-Hagler in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
One system, American Cable in Westchester, Kulis said, had already reported a 
buy rate of 24% by Monday afternoon.

And so professional boxing, a strange enterprise which has craftily learned to 
manipulate cable television technology and reward its athletes with 
multi-million dollar paydays, will once again have to address a decades old 
question: Why can't it seem eliminate draws, as amateur boxing did, about a 
half-century ago.

BATES GETS FIRST CHANCE AT THIRD; 
</P>
<P>
ESPERANZA SHORTSTOP SHIFTS FOR ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He's never played third base or played on a winning team in high school, but 
Jason Bates of Esperanza High School will be the starting third baseman for the 
North team at 7 tonight in the 22nd Orange County All-Star baseball game at 
Anaheim's Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It might be a bit unusual in a game that features the best prep players in one 
of the nation's hotbeds for baseball, but then Bates' high school career has 
been unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, who is being shifted to a new position tonight because of a shortage of 
third baseman on the North, played at three high schools in four seasons. He 
played at Santa Fe High in Santa Fe Springs where he earned a spot on the 
varsity as a sophomore before transferring to Whittier Christian, a private 
school in La Habra, for his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a more attractive school to play baseball and go to school," 
Bates said. "But it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Bates' family failed to change residency when he transferred to Whittier 
Christian, so under Southern Section rules he had to play on the junior-varsity 
team. Bates batted .740 on the JV team, but said one of the only things he 
learned was patience. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a football coach who was basically filling in," Bates said. So it was 
time for another change. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Bates' family moved to Placentia where he enrolled at Esperanza for 
his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of playing for Esperanza was real attractive," he said. "The teams 
had been to the (Southern Section) championships for three straight years. I 
came here envisioning greatness." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Esperanza struggled to a 10-11-1 record, finishing fifth in the Empire 
League and missing the playoffs for the first time in Coach Mike Curran's 
seven-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"The season was a disappointment, but I have no regrets about coming here," 
Bates said. "I definitely improved as a player and made a lot of good friends 
here. We didn't have a lot of wins, but I wouldn't trade the experience of 
playing baseball at Esperanza." 
</P>
<P>
Bates was named the team's most valuable player after hitting .430 and stealing 
15 bases. His on-base percentage of .690 was among the best in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"He carried us," Curran said. "Jason was one of the few bright spots this 
season. We had a gaping hole at shortstop and he fit in very well with the 
other players. He's one of the quickest players I've coached." 
</P>
<P>
Curran compared Bates to a player he coached at St. Paul, Oakland Athletics 
infielder Mike Gallego. But while Gallego was highly recruited after his senior 
year in 1978, Bates has failed to attract an offer from a Division I college. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that Jason Bates is the victim of our poor season," Curran 
said. "He's a Division-I player whose recruiting was (hurt) because of a losing 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he if had to do it all over again, he wouldn't change a thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed my high school career," he said. "But sometimes I wonder if my 
future would have been different if I had played four years at Esperanza. It 
was definitely an adjustment coming here. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity of practice was so different. We were constantly doing 
something, there was no wasted time. Everything was so well-organized." 
</P>
<P>
Bates will have a heavy diet of baseball over the summer. He is playing for the 
Orange County Cardinals, a Connie Mack team, through the summer and also will 
play some games in the Metropolitan League. 
</P>
<P>
"I could play every day," Bates said. "In fact, I've played or practiced almost 
every day for two years. I couldn't think of anything better than getting paid 
to play baseball. That would be a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
All-Star Notes 
</P>
<P>
The North leads the series, 11-10, after overcoming a 7-0, first-inning deficit 
to gain a 9-7 victory last year. . . . North Coach Bob Canary of Dana Hills 
shared playing time at shortstop for the North team in the 1969 game with 
former Kennedy star Alan Bannister, who played 12 seasons in the major leagues. 
Bannister is the manager for the Montreal Expos' double-A team in Jacksonville, 
Fla.

Fred Ricart's 127 salespeople managed to sell a record 24,000 Fords last year 
partly because of the zany antics of their boss, a self-confessed ham who 
pitches cars in television commercials by strumming a guitar and crooning 
lyrics written by his 10-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Ricart, with $232.6 million in sales last year, says that -- minus fleet sales 
-- he is the No. 1 auto dealer, although industry accounts and rankings vary. 
</P>
<P>
He chides competitors who include fleet sales when tallying up their sales 
figures. Ricart includes only automobiles sold to individual customers for 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Others say they're the biggest, but I don't believe in comparing apples and 
oranges. We don't include fleet sales, period. No one has ever topped 230 
(million dollars in sales)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cherub-faced Fred (We're Dealin) Ricart is a local celebrity in the country's 
26th-largest auto market, although much of the guitar-toting auto mogul's 
business comes from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his 66 television commercials feature Ricart strumming his six-string 
and singing words penned by his daughter ("This Van Is Your Van, This Van Is My 
Van," or maybe, "Whole Lotta Dealin' Goin' On!"). He plays 19 instruments and 
has a recording studio in his home. 
</P>
<P>
Ricart admits that he couldn't carry a tune in the back of a pickup, but "I 
really am a pretty good guitar player." 
</P>
<P>
People tell him his television pitches are annoying, but Ricart believes that 
they actually enjoy them, and according to the sales figures, they certainly 
remember them. 
</P>
<P>
A $30-million inventory, including his nearby Van Land, sprawled out on 77 
acres on Columbus' east side makes Ricart Ford look more like a small city than 
an auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made this a big Disneyland complex," said Ricart, 38, who left college 
to help rescue his father's ailing Ford business 16 years ago. "You don't see 
someone silly on TV and then come in and see some snub-nosed salesman. We want 
to make it fun." 
</P>
<P>
Parents can soon shop for a new set of wheels while their children play video 
games at Ricart's day-care center, now under construction. Customers who are 
ever-fearful of the auto mechanic can order a videotape of any repair work done 
on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't trust mechanics. You don't know if they do what they say 
they're doing, so we'll videotape it just to be sure," said Ricart, a former 
biology student at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The service center is open 24 hours, but if you're still too busy to take in 
the T-Bird, a $23,000 diagnostic van will pull into your driveway or office 
parking lot, and a technician, clad in coat and tie, will fix it there. 
</P>
<P>
Ricart admits that his prices aren't the lowest. He says, however, his 
dealership fixes many cars for free, even when they are no longer under 
warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Success magazine, which called him the biggest dealer of American autos in the 
world, said Ricart gave away $380,000 in service not covered by warranty last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't really care what they pay for a car. We're more concerned with 
the human factor," Ricart says.

ALMANAC / ORANGE COUNTY CROP REPORT: NURSERY STOCK, FLOWERS TOP LIST OF CROP 
VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the 20th straight year, nursery stock and cut flowers topped the list of 
Orange County crops ranked by dollar value, according to the 1988 Orange County 
Crop Report. 
</P>
<P>
Nursery stock was valued at $123.9 million, a decline of 2% from 1987 but 
almost triple the value of the second-place crop, strawberries, and about six 
times the value of third-place Valencia oranges. 
</P>
<P>
Gross dollar value as measured in the report includes cost of production, 
harvesting and preparation for market, and does not reflect net return to the 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in the animal industry, orchard and truck crops helped push the gross 
value of all crops to $253.6 million, a 3% increase over 1987's total.

HOW AGRICULTURAL MIX HAS CHANGED 
</P>
<P>
The value of Orange County's nursery, orchard and vegetable crops have 
increased substantially since 1968, while the animal industry's dollar value 
has declined. The gross value of all Orange County agricultural products has 
more than tripled since 1968 to $253.6 million. Chart at left does not include 
value of apiculture and field crops. Charts at right show how use of county 
farm acreage has changed since 1968.

<P>
NATIONAL EDUCATION SIGNALS DROP IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Education Corp. in Irvine said Monday that it anticipates a 
substantial drop in second-quarter sales and earnings, compared to the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
After the announcement, National Education stock lost $3.625 per share, or 
18.5% of its value, closing at $16 in heavy volume of 818,000 shares traded on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, the nation's largest educational-training company, said that profits 
would drop because its Applied Learning International subsidiary, which 
recently went eight months without a chief executive, has not met sales 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company could earn as little as $3 million for the quarter, 
compared to $7.2 million in the same period a year ago, according to Douglas M. 
Arthur, an analyst at the New York brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Bert Boksen of Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., 
said negative effects of National Education's recent acquisition binge are 
beginning to surface. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of acquisitions began in 1986 when National Education acquired Deltak, 
an Illinois data-processing firm. In 1987, National bought Advanced Systems, an 
Illinois-based provider of consulting services and training products. It 
combined Deltak and Advanced to form the Applied Learning subsidiary, a 
$180-million-a-year business. Last year, Applied Learning acquired Spectrum 
Interactive, a developer of corporate educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected it to catch up with them, but I didn't expect it to be this fast," 
said Boksen, adding that National Education may have overvalued Advanced 
Systems at the time of its purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Boksen said National Education benefited from its acquisitions last year when 
it reported record earnings of $46.1 million and revenue of $457.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the torrid sales pace that produced a number of long-term contracts last 
year couldn't be sustained, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that before National Education can begin increasing sales and 
earnings again, it must put some troubles behind. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, according to Arthur: 
</P>
<P>
* An incorrectly structured sales effort. When Applied Learning was formed, the 
sales efforts of the subsidiaries were consolidated into a national operation. 
While this has reduced costs, analysts said, it has sometimes been ineffective 
in getting new business. Company spokesman Jerry Derloshon acknowledged that 
the structure has had its drawbacks and that the company is now realigning its 
sales operation. 
</P>
<P>
* Ineffective record-keeping at Applied Learning. Derloshon said the 
integration of the record-keeping of three companies into one has not gone as 
smoothly as expected. He said most of the needed improvements have been 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
* Applied Learning has had difficulty expanding into new markets. The 
subsidiary, widely recognized in the data-processing industry, is not as well 
known in other industries that rely on corporate training and consulting. The 
company also sells a large volume of training videotapes but has been less 
successful at marketing consulting services. Derloshon said that by marketing a 
broader array of training products and consulting services, the amount of time 
it takes to make a sale has been lengthened, which has added to the sales 
slowdown during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
* A loss of top managers. In March, Jerry Cwertnia resigned as National 
Education's president. In September, 1988, Applied Learning chief William Roach 
resigned. Also last year, Chairman John J. McNaughton, who founded National 
Education in 1977, retired at age 65 and was replaced by H. David Bright. 
</P>
<P>
The Applied Learning post, temporarily held by Bright, was filled only three 
weeks ago with the hiring of Kenneth Riedlinger, a former Ford Motor Co. 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Bright, who also took over duties as National Education president upon 
Cwertnia's resignation, has said he has not made plans to hire another 
president for National Education. 
</P>
<P>
"His attitude is that National Education has become a holding company of sorts, 
and he wants top operating people in the operating subsidiaries," said Clarke 
L. Walser, an analyst at Chicago Corp, an Illinois brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
But Boksen said that Bright is being overworked and that the company is now 
thin on top management. 
</P>
<P>
Boksen, who first warned in March that National Education could hit an earnings 
snag, said he expects the company's 1989 earnings to remain below last year's 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
But he and other analysts say that National Education has the ability to turn 
its operations around and that they expect it to reverse the downturn.

IRS INVESTIGATING IRVINE INVESTMENT FIRM THAT SOLD FARMING TAX SHELTER PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service is investigating an Irvine investment firm in what 
a federal agent describes as one of the largest criminal tax fraud probes in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed to obtain a search warrant on the offices of Amcor 
Capital Inc., IRS Special Agent Wilbur Goolkasian alleges that the case 
involves $1 billion in fraudulent deductions. 
</P>
<P>
He said the deductions were taken by about 4,000 investors throughout the 
country who have pumped $356 million into various Amcor tax shelter investment 
programs since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit alleges conspiracy to commit tax evasion and aiding and assisting 
in the filing of fraudulent tax returns, but it is unclear whether individual 
investors are suspected of tax fraud or whether the probe centers only on 
Amcor. IRS agents declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS has been cracking down on tax shelters for several years and has 
uncovered a number of large frauds. But one federal agent who asked not to be 
identified said a $1-billion case would be one of the biggest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Amcor President George L. Wright, in a telephone interview Monday, denied the 
allegations. He also called the dollar amounts cited in the affidavit 
"substantially overstated" and said that if any civil or criminal charges are 
filed against the company "we will vigorously defend ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
But Wendell L. Davies, an attorney in Amarillo, Tex., said in an interview that 
former Amcor President George L. Schrieber and an Amcor attorney, Ted R. Frame, 
personally represented to him that the investments were intended to enable 
investors to claim massive deductions for agricultural expenses that the 
partnerships did not, in fact, incur. 
</P>
<P>
Davies represents a group of Amarillo-area farmers who participated with Amcor 
in a series of deals in which they signed phony land-lease and farming 
agreements. Davies obtained immunity from prosecution for his clients in return 
for their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
He said he brought the case to the U.S. attorney's office in May, 1988, before 
the IRS began its criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
Davies said Monday that IRS agents videotaped one meeting he had with Schrieber 
and Frame last year in which the two men went through his clients' files to 
remove documents they did not want IRS investigators to see. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said he wore a tape recorder at another meeting in which Frame and 
Schrieber outlined the entire scheme and Frame referred to it as "a tax 
gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
Schrieber, a Villa Park resident, could not be reached for comment. Wright said 
Schrieber left the company in April "to pursue other interests." 
</P>
<P>
Frame, in a telephone interview from his offices in the San Joaquin Valley 
farming town of Coalinga, said his lawyer advised him not to comment on any 
specific part of the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can say overall that the conversations reported by the affidavit are 
inaccurate and mischaracterized," Frame said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Amcor officials had no knowledge of any IRS investigation until IRS 
agents served the search warrant in March and seized numerous files and 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The search warrant affidavit was ordered sealed by a federal court judge in Los 
Angeles and was not made public until late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Amcor is the successor of a privately held firm called American Agri-Corp., 
which was founded in 1981 to sell interests in agricultural limited 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farmers Never Saw Money 
</P>
<P>
According to Goolkasian's affidavit, the company has marketed interests in at 
least 192 limited partnerships and corporations that have acquired or leased 
farmlands in California, Texas, Oregon and also in Mexico. Wright said the 
company also has farming interests in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said Amcor signed 119 separate farming agreements with Davies' 
clients between 1982 and 1988. The agreements provided that the farmers would 
grow farm crops for the limited partnerships, but the farmers said it was 
understood that no crops would in fact be grown, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Amcor allegedly funneled more than $100 million in and out of bank accounts 
established for those agreements. However, the farmers never saw any of the 
money and received a payment of about $2 per acre for signing the pacts, Davies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the IRS presses its civil and criminal investigations of Amcor and its 
various officers and subsidiaries, the company -- which went public in December 
in a reverse acquisition of a shell corporation -- is seeking Securities and 
Exchange Commission authorization to sell 600,000 new shares of stock on the 
over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Amcor has also applied to the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the group 
that regulates the over-the-counter market, for listing of its stock on the 
NASD automated quotation system, NASDAQ. Such a listing would make the stock -- 
now only sold by a few independent brokers called market makers -- widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he does not know how the IRS investigation will affect Amcor's 
secondary stock issue or its NASDAQ application.

A FEROCIOUS 'CAT' PROWLS THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all the earned and unearned mystique that surrounds Tennessee Williams a 
mere half-dozen years after his death, his best work seems only to be getting 
better. Perhaps because the faded ferocity of his genteel world is beginning to 
seem otherworldly. Perhaps because there are so few 21-carat poets of the 
theater left among us -- and the ones we have speak another, newer language. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever. A yeasty Seattle Rep production of Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" 
has come to the Southland to make the point. The show paused at Pepperdine 
University's Smothers Theatre last week on a swing through Western states. 
</P>
<P>
It is distinguished by rich Southern flavor, strong direction and heady casting 
fired up by at least two superlative key performances: that of Barbara 
Dirickson as the feline Maggie and William Biff McGuire as the ruthless Big 
Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
This tale of mendacity and greed at the heart of a divided Mississippi Delta 
family thrives on regurgitated truths and hemorrhaging egos. 
</P>
<P>
The excuse for this high-pitched and unsavory family reunion is the party 
celebrating the 65th birthday and supposed clean bill of health of Big Daddy 
(McGuire), the family's relentlessly brutal patriarch. But rancorous Big Daddy 
is dying of cancer and wishes he could take his millions and his 28,000-acre 
plantation with him rather than leave them with his survivors. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is an airhead; one son is a fool; the other, whom he favors, is a 
drunk. What's a tyrant to do? 
</P>
<P>
Williams uses the course of this sultry evening for a string of confrontations, 
confessions and revelations that peel away at a tangle of exposed nerves and 
vulgarly avaricious intentions. This is Southern Gothic at its spiciest, with 
an ending that's a bit too chastened to ring true. 
</P>
<P>
Rep director Mary Robinson has chosen to use a pre-Broadway version of Act III, 
which lies somewhere between the original and the softer Broadway revision. But 
Brick's seeming accession to Maggie's advances at the closing curtain still 
rings false. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking of a virtual moment, however; everything up to that point is 
sterling (except for some verbal -- or acoustical? -- mushiness; you cannot 
speak too softly in these halls). 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's clear reading of the play is aptly shrill and harsh. Dirickson's 
Maggie picks up on the character's self-description as "hard, cruel and 
frantic," delivering a performance that's tough as nails and becomes almost as 
grating to us in its persistent railing as it is to taciturn husband Brick. 
</P>
<P>
As Brick, Stephen Pelinski has the right athletic looks and stony face. The 
role is thanklessly reactive, but he and Dirickson achieve such a high level of 
toxicity between them that it makes such reaction easier -- and the final 
reconciliation even harder to accept. 
</P>
<P>
John Procaccino's Gooper and Marianne Owens' Mae are stamped with the universal 
hallmarks of pious nerds -- small, diligent people with a large appetite for 
malice and a duplicitous spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Big Mama suffers a tad at the hands of Eve Roberts, who cannot adequately 
suppress her own intelligence to convey the stolid huff and puff of this giddy, 
lumbering woman. But she does compensate by delivering the right ferociousness 
in her more indignant moments. John Aylward and Woody Eney round out the 
company as the more peripheral Reverend Tooker and Doctor Baugh, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Jess Goldstein has provided a creamy array of Southern summer 
costumes, and Ralph Funicello has devised an ample, high-ceilinged antebellum 
bedroom to complement them, well-lit by Craig Miller and Rick Paulsen.

BUSEY WANTS TO BOARD THE STARSHIP ROCK 'N' ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Busey has never been cast in any of the "Star Trek" movies, but that's not 
deterring him from trying to boldly go where no actor has gone before: to rock 
'n' roll stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of rockers have beamed up to the big screen, starting with Elvis (the 
Capt. Kirk of rock 'n' roll himself) to the Beatles up through Tina Turner and 
Sting. It's successfully navigating the opposite direction that apparently 
requires greater warp drive. 
</P>
<P>
Busey -- who gained fame playing one of rock's pioneers in "The Buddy Holly 
Story" -- made his latest bid Sunday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, 
where he joined ex-Band members Rick Danko and Garth Hudson and assorted 
friends for the final show of a fleeting three-date Southland tour. 
</P>
<P>
Busey was far more believable in the rock singer role than Dennis Quaid, the 
man who would be Killer in "Great Balls of Fire," the upcoming film biography 
of Jerry Lee Lewis. Quaid-watchers will recall that he brought his own rock 
band, the Eclectics, to Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach for a dull concert in 
March, hinting that if he manages to project any charisma or rock authority in 
"Great Balls of Fire," major credit will belong to the director. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Quaid, Busey has a decent singing voice. If he sounds reminiscent of any 
rocker, it would be Del Shannon, with a similarly clear, piercing tenor 
(although Shannon's power and control are light years beyond Busey's). 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Busey possesses enough basic rock 'n' roll instincts that they 
lifted his performance above the level of one who is merely slumming. Busey 
apparently cares about this music, even if he did flub a lyric here and there. 
As a front man, he was obviously nervous and a bit stiff at the mike early on, 
but he soon felt comfortable enough to get a little chatty with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Busey shouldn't start thinking about trading in his Actor's Equity card for a 
Musicians' Union membership. But in the handful of numbers he led, he seemed to 
have a whale of a good time without embarrassing himself, or those he shared 
the stage with. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did several of Buddy Holly's hits, by the way, he made no attempt 
to invoke the late performer's persona, as he did so effectively in the 1978 
movie. He came across as a man who has spent a few nights in the house of 
Holly, not taken up full-time residence there. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Danko, acting as master of ceremonies throughout the two-hour show, 
quickly established a living-room-jam-session-like ambiance, opening with a 
couple of sit-down, back-porch blues numbers for which he was joined by 
Jefferson Airplane stalwart Jorma Kaukonen on slide guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually vibrating with manic energy, Danko's voice was nonetheless 
distressingly colorless, coarse and flat -- early on. But eventually he hit his 
stride and illustrated the distinction between a competent rock singer, which 
Busey is, and a great one, which Danko can be when so inclined. He sounded most 
inclined in garden-fresh readings of "Twilight" and "It Makes No Difference," 
pulled from a nostalgia-heavy song list that included a half-dozen Band 
chestnuts.

Garth Hudson contributed musical bits and pieces on keyboards and saxophones in 
his characteristically absent-minded-professor manner (in some dead language, 
Garth must mean "The Bearded One Who Never Utters a Word"). Actually, he looked 
remarkably like the mysterious gray-haired deity that the crew of the USS 
Enterprise encounters during its search for God in the new "Star Trek" movie. 
</P>
<P>
In some way, the resemblance was more than coincidental: Hudson created entire 
worlds of beauty out of primordial chords fashioned by fingers that seemed to 
hold the musical wisdom of the universe.

RUBEN BLADES' PERFORMANCE A GOOD OMEN FOR LATIN JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR VALLE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In many ways, Sunday night's Ruben Blades concert at the Ventura Theatre could 
be seen as a good omen for Latin jazz and salsa on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Blades isn't new to this edge of the continent. His mission of broadening 
salsa's boundaries by fusing it with new-jazz and world-beat inflections and a 
rich tradition of Latino narrative balladry has grown synergistically with his 
movie career. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, though the New York veterans who invented salsa more than two decades 
ago are faced with losing a new Latino generation as it forges a Latin hip-hop 
identity, they still tour here. Meanwhile, the handful of local bands, many 
with deep jazz roots, are surviving with modest success. 
</P>
<P>
What Panama's hybrid salsa-jazz-movie superstar brought to his wildly 
enthusiastic fans was the promise of more live performances at smaller clubs 
like the Ventura -- and the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano where Blades 
plays Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite periodic sound problems which made it difficult to hear his voice, 
Blades managed to provide local salsa acts with a new standard. 
</P>
<P>
His band, Son del Solar, has expanded to 11 members with the addition of 
trombonists "Papo" Vasquez and Reinaldo Jorge, who have had a humanizing effect 
on the band: They lend flashes of heat and color to the jazzier, cooler, 
overtly synthesized sound of such songs as "Nacer de Ti" ("Born From You") and 
"Patria" ("Motherland"), Blades' best love song to date, from his current 
"Antecedente" album. 
</P>
<P>
Against the brutal accuracy of Robert Ameen's drumming on traps, Blades 
returned to his extroverted storytelling style. His fans needn't have badgered 
him with requests for songs from his early days (like 1978, when Blades changed 
salsa's face by recording "Pedro Navaja," the music's best-selling single 
ever). He obliged willingly. 
</P>
<P>
If there was an awkward moment during his performance, it was when Blades 
prefaced two of his songs from his English-language "Nothing but the Truth" 
album by taking a shot at critics who have stereotyped him as merely a salsero 
(Third World artist). In some ways Blades is right: His English-speaking voice 
is indeed remarkably flexible, especially in lower, slower jazz registers. 
</P>
<P>
But his performance of "Hopes on Hold" -- a rock-inflected collaboration with 
Lou Reed -- underscored the album's weaknesses in songwriting. Many of the 
songs from "Nothing but the Truth" simply sound stilted -- like 
well-intentioned but awkward translations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Blades plays Wednesday at 8 and 10:30 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

O.C BOARD REFUSES TO BAN BIAS AGAINST AIDS VICTIMS; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS REJECT PLAN ON 3-2 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote before a tense and emotional crowd, the Board of Supervisors 
today killed a proposed anti-discrimination ordinance to protect AIDS victims, 
making Orange County the first urban area in California to reject such a 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors heard about three hours of testimony from nearly 40 speakers -- 
almost equally divided on the issue -- before making their vote shortly after 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition was led by Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition 
based in Anaheim. Sheldon said his group sent out about 1,000 letters to 
encourage people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon and many other critics charged that the ordinance would grant special 
rights to homosexuals, a high-risk group in regards to AIDS, at the expense of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a class of people linked together by behavior," Sheldon said of 
homosexuals. "Reasonable people might want to consider their perverted sexual 
behavior" when asked to associate with AIDS victims in work or social 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who joined Supervisor Thomas F. Riley in 
supporting the ordinance, said, "I support the fears and concerns of those 
opposed to the ordinance -- it is a fear of the unknown. I'm concerned about 
the spread of the disease. I'm concerned about ignorance spreading the 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
All three of the supervisors voting against the ordinance -- Don Roth of 
Anaheim, Roger Stanton of Santa Ana, and Gaddi Vasquez of Mission Viejo -- said 
they believe existing state and federal laws already protect AIDS victims from 
discrimination.

<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors, after hearing more than two hours of 
emotionally charged testimony, rejected an ordinance today that would have 
prohibited discrimination against AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 3-2 against the law, which would have banned discrimination in 
housing, employment, county services or by any business in unincorporated 
county areas because a person has AIDS or tested positive for the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the ordinance makes Orange County the only urban county in 
California not to have an AIDS anti-discrimination law on its books. Los 
Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Riverside and Alameda counties all have 
enacted similar laws.

KUKLA AND OLLIE'S FRAN ALLISON DIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Fran Allison, best remembered as the warmhearted human foil for puppets on the 
popular "Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie" television show, died today at Sherman Oaks 
Community Hospital. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Allison joined the late Burr Tillstrom's puppet show when it began in 1947 on 
local TV in Chicago. She had worked as a singer and radio personality in shows 
originating from Chicago during the 1930s and 1940s, including playing "Aunt 
Fanny" on Don McNeill's "Breakfast Club." 
</P>
<P>
The whimsical puppet program, featuring Tillstrom's "Kuklapolitan Players," was 
one of television's longest-running children's programs and focused on the 
perpetually worried Kukla and the carefree Oliver J. Dragon. 
</P>
<P>
Allison essentially played herself, a Chicago singer and actress who appeared 
in front of the puppet stage. Her sweet interaction with the puppets was so 
natural that she brought the little drama to life for millions of youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Allison was born in La Porte City, Iowa. After studying at Coe College in Cedar 
Rapids, she worked as a public school teacher for a time.

FIFTH AMENDMENT INVOKED BY TOP AIDE IN HOUSING SCANDAL

<P>
The top aide to former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce invoked her Fifth 
Amendment rights today and refused to answer questions from a House 
subcommittee investigating a growing housing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Gore Dean, former executive assistant to Pierce, who headed the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development for all eight years of the Reagan 
Administration, appeared under subpoena before the House Government Operations 
Housing Subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The panel has been investigating influence peddling in the awarding of 
low-income housing contracts and Dean has emerged as the key decision-maker in 
deciding which developers -- often aided by high-priced Republican consultants, 
including former Interior Secretary James Watt -- won HUD contracts for a 
rent-subsidy program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Favoritism and Abuse' 
</P>
<P>
Current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who also is looking into alleged abuses under 
Pierce, has said the program appeared to be "based on the perception and 
reality of favoritism and abuse." 
</P>
<P>
A HUD inspector general's report found that developers who hired GOP 
consultants often won the competition for scarce housing contract dollars, 
while those not using Republican consultants often lost out. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by two lawyers, including Joseph diGenova, former U.S. attorney for 
the District of Columbia, Dean cited the Fifth Amendment protection against 
self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions today. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was unable to respond because HUD documents she said she needs 
have not yet been made available to her. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of my present inability to obtain access to the HUD records which 
would enable me to prepare adequately for testimony that would be complete and 
truthful, I have accepted the advice of my counsel to decline, respectfully, to 
answer any questions posed by the subcommittee at this time on the basis of the 
rights guaranteed to me by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined to Reply 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) tried asking Dean questions 
that involved no self-incrimination, such as the date she began working at HUD, 
but she declined to reply, citing the advice of her lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Dean's stance bothered Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Rep. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.), who said Dean's request for HUD documents was so long -- all 
of Pierce's telephone logs, diaries and other records -- that it might never be 
complied with. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer wondered aloud whether the document request was "simply a gigantic 
roadblock thrown in the way of this hearing." 
</P>
<P>
But Lantos said he had "no reason to assume that Ms. Dean is attempting to 
permanently delay" the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impropriety Denied 
</P>
<P>
Pierce testified before the panel last month and denied any impropriety. Watt, 
testifying last Friday, denied the $300,000 he and associates got for helping a 
Maryland developer win approval of a housing project was improper influence 
peddling. 
</P>
<P>
Dean was quoted in the Wall Street Journal last month as saying the program in 
question "was set up and designed to be a political program" and "we ran it in 
a political manner." She also denied impropriety.

Tests of the vandalized Old Faithful water treatment plant found no 
contamination and visitors to Yellowstone National Park were told they could 
resume drinking the water, a park spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
An Oregon man who allegedly was caught damaging the plant Sunday was still in 
jail at Mammoth, awaiting transportation to Cheyenne to face a federal criminal 
charge. "He's still not talking so we don't have a motive," park spokeswoman 
Marsha Karle said. "The water was not contaminated so we're turning all the 
drinking fountains back on." 
</P>
<P>
A ranger on routine patrol caught Michael J. Willett, 38, of Sumpter, Ore., 
damaging the equipment used to treat water for the Old Faithful area about 9 
a.m. Sunday, Karle said. The damage was estimated at $10,000 to $25,000 and 
officials decided to ban water consumption in the popular area around Old 
Faithful Geyser in the west-central part of the park.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a broad 
declaration today that calls for a 50% reduction in nuclear arsenals and a 
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The document on common principles of both nations was signed on the second day 
of the Soviet leader's first state visit to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The pact signed by Kohl and Gorbachev said their countries have a common 
European heritage, and that European nations should exist in "peaceful 
competition with one another" and reduce their military might. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Common European Home' 
</P>
<P>
It also said cooperation by West Germany and the Soviet Union "is not directed 
against anyone" and that a special place in the "common European home" is 
reserved for the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the agreement could help resolve territorial questions stirred by the 
1939 non-aggression pact signed by Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin -- which 
allowed the Soviet Union to annex three independent Baltic states -- Gorbachev 
told a reporter, "I don't think we need to turn to such a distant chapter of 
history." 
</P>
<P>
He said the joint agreement was to formalize the wish of both Moscow and Bonn 
to enter "a new stage in our relations." 
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was carried live on West German television. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Gorbachev received a rapturous reception that outstripped the welcome 
given two weeks ago to Bush, who scores far below the Soviet leader in West 
German opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Great Joy' 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said today that he does not believe opinion polls showing he is West 
Germany's favorite politician, but the enthusiastic welcome he has received in 
Bonn makes him very happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am quite pleased with the atmosphere here. For me it is a great joy," 
Gorbachev told reporters a few hours after being greeted by thousands of West 
Germans in Bonn's market place. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't really believe in those polls," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev ranks higher than any other leader in West German opinion polls, the 
latest of which showed that 90% of all people surveyed trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Bonn residents showed their feelings today by chanting "Gorby, 
Gorby" and giving the Kremlin chief the most enthusiastic welcome afforded a 
foreign leader in years. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev plunged into the cheering crowds, shaking hands, signing autographs 
and even hoisting a young boy onto his shoulder. Smiling and laughing much of 
the time, he was obviously enjoying himself.

Rangel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the subcommittee on select revenue measures, said 
the minimum-tax bill almost certainly will be modified by the parent panel.

Taiwan will send five missions to the United States between August and early 
1990 to buy American products worth about $1.5 billion to help narrow the trade 
gap between the two countries, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Chang Chung-chien, vice economic minister, told reporters that an agricultural 
team will leave in August to buy about 600,000 tons of wheat and 50,000 tons of 
barley. 
</P>
<P>
This will be followed by an industrial group that will buy machinery and 
equipment for power stations, oil refineries, petrochemical plants and 
telecommunications networks.

Abalkin, nominated to the post last week by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov amid

JOHNSON BEGS FOR 2ND CHANCE TO COMPETE;

Ben Johnson today begged for a second chance to compete for Canada and admitted 
that he took steroids in 1987 before setting a world record in the 100-meter 
dash that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinter told an inquiry into drugs and athletics that he wants to compete 
for Canada in the 1992 Olympics. Asked if he could be the fastest without 
drugs, he replied: "I know I can be." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said he wants to send a message to youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell them to be honest, don't take drugs. I've been there. I know 
what it's like to cheat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he lied about cheating at the Seoul Olympics until now because "I 
was ashamed for my family and friends. I was just in a mess." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Expected 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who lost his gold medal in Seoul because of steroids, also 
acknowledged using them before setting a world record in the 100-meter dash at 
the 1987 World Track and Field Championships in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinter said he was given steroid injections for two weeks at the end of 
June and early July before the August, 1987, meet at which he set the 
still-standing world record of 9.83 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the scandal over Johnson's steroid use, the record has been allowed to 
stand, but athletics officials have said they would review the situation if 
there was evidence that the sprinter had taken banned performance-enhancing 
substances before the event. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinter confirmed that he was given steroid injections by his coach, 
Charlie Francis, last Aug. 24, and by personal physician Dr. Jamie Astaphan 
last Aug. 25 and 28 before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he took no substances on his own between that time and the 
100-meter race at Seoul on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honey-Vinegar Drink 
</P>
<P>
He forfeited the 9.79-second performance that bested his own world record and 
the Olympic gold medal because of a positive test for the anabolic steroid 
stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said that he did not drink a honey-and-vinegar beverage that 
Astaphan sent to him the day of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Although there had been speculation Astaphan was trying to mask the most recent 
steroid injections, the doctor testified that it was nothing but an energy 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he returned to Canada immediately from Seoul after returning his 
gold medal because he was concerned about the security of his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get them out of there quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry panel appears to be headed toward a conclusion that Johnson's coach 
and physician rushed in a last-minute steroid program before the Olympics 
because of Johnson's disappointing August European tour and failed to leave 
enough clearance time. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he wondered about the change from the usual routine of steroid 
treatments in fall, spring and early summer, the athlete answered: "No, sir."

An order to impound the America's Cup catamaran Stars and Stripes for 
nonpayment of a debt has been lifted, the U.S. marshal's office reported today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the marshal's office said a court order was received late 
Friday to lift the lien placed on the boat and other property of Sail America, 
which organized the defense of yachting's premier trophy last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several containers of equipment, including the disassembled catamaran used to 
defeat New Zealand 2-0 last September, were seized on June 5 by the U.S. 
government for nonpayment of a $225,000 debt owed to North Sails Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Hansen of North Sails said the board of directors had unanimously voted to 
drop the lawsuit and attempt to work out a payment plan with Sail America, now 
called the America's Cup Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
A court later disqualified Stars and Stripes and awarded the cup to New 
Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club. That action is under appeal.

OHIO STATE'S WILLIAMS TO COACH AT MD.

Ohio State Coach Gary Williams today was named head basketball coach at the 
University of Maryland, a once-prominent program riddled with turmoil for most 
of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 43, takes over the Terrapin program after three seasons at Ohio 
State, where he had a 59-41 record. He replaces Bob Wade, who resigned under 
pressure May 12 after completing three years of a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Williams' fourth head coaching position in an 11-year career in 
which he has amassed a 217-128 record. He coached at American University from 
1978 to '82 and Boston College from 1982 to '86 before going to Ohio State. He 
posted a winning record and recorded at least two 20-win seasons at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was a three-year starter on Maryland's basketball team before 
graduating in 1968, inherits a team that went 9-20 last year, the most losses 
by a Maryland team since 1940-41, and won only one of 14 Atlantic Coast 
Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NCAA Recruiting Probe 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1988-89 season, the Terps lost six players to transfers, academic 
ineligibility, redshirting or suspension. In March, the program was placed 
under investigation for NCAA recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has yet to make public its findings or whatever penalties Maryland may 
incur stemming from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Terps had losing records in two of the three seasons since the drug-related 
death of Len Bias in June, 1986. From 1971 to '86, Maryland posted 10 20-win 
seasons and two ACC regular-season championships under Coach Lefty Driesell, 
who resigned under pressure weeks before the 1985-86 season. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland's selection of Williams ended a monthlong search by a six-member 
search committee that interviewed five candidates for the job last week. 
</P>
<P>
The other four finalists for the position were USC Coach George Raveling, 
Rutgers Coach Bob Wenzel; North Carolina-Charlotte Coach Jeff Mullins, and Ben 
Jobe of Southern University. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins withdrew his name from consideration last Friday, and Raveling did the 
same Sunday.

Seattle SuperSonics star guard Dale Ellis was fined $346 after being found 
guilty of assaulting his wife and resisting arrest during a January incident at 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who had been scheduled to appear in Bellevue District Court today, was 
ordered to see a private counselor and fined at the non-jury trial Friday 
before Judge Brian Gain. If Ellis does not commit another crime for a year, the 
convictions will be stricken from his record, Gain said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Steve Hayne, who represented Ellis, said Ellis and his wife remain 
together and have purchased a new home in Bellevue.
