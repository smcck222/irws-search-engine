IMPOSED AFTER BEIJING CRUSHED PROTESTS. WASHINGTON HAS OBJECTED.

In the year since the Bush Administration blocked U.S. military sales to China 
after the crushing of democracy protests at Tian An Men Square, Israel has 
emerged as the most important foreign supplier of advanced military technology 
to China, officials in the Bush Administration and Congress say. 
</P>
<P>
According to these sources, Israel increasingly is providing China with 
military technology that China is unable to obtain from the United States. Some 
U.S. defense specialists say that Israel may be supplying China with engine 
technology to build a new combat jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official said the United States has made clear to 
Israel that it strongly opposes the new military cooperation, which undercuts 
the intended effect of the year-old U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is over our objections," he said. "I'd rather not get into the 
tit-for-tat on this. But they know our views." 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials insist that Israel is not operating as a proxy 
for the United States in the military sales, as Israel did when it supplied 
arms to Iran during the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Although Israel and China have no diplomatic relations, the two countries are 
known to have carried out quiet military cooperation with one another for 
nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The growing U.S. concern about Israel's actions was prompted by recent Israeli 
technology transfers to China and by the opening of an office of the Israeli 
Academy of Sciences in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Israelis) are moving in so many areas, it's a matter of sort of 
limiting, somehow, those areas," said the senior Bush Administration official. 
"They've opened this institute in Beijing which is facilitating a whole range 
of military-to-military cooperation between Israel and China." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington declined to comment on 
Israeli military sales to China or the Bush Administration's objections to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western and Asian intelligence specialists, Israel in recent years 
has provided China with some of the advanced technology, such as electronics 
and guidance systems, needed to modernize China's existing jet aircraft and 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Military cooperation with Israel also enables China to obtain advanced 
technology at relatively low cost. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take a plane that costs $1 million, spend $10 million upgrading it 
with advanced electronics, and the result will be a plane that would cost you 
$25 million if you bought it new," one Asian diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese probably see Israel as a back door to U.S. technology that the 
United States won't sell them," observed Morton S. Miller, a retired State 
Department intelligence official who published a report on Israeli arms sales 
to China for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
</P>
<P>
For Israel, cooperation with China is said to provide cash and much-needed 
business for its arms industry. It also enables Israel to obtain valuable 
intelligence about missile programs in China, a leading arms supplier for 
several of Israel's adversaries in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis wanted to get into the Chinese system, to know who is doing what 
for whom and where things are going," said one Western intelligence official. 
</P>
<P>
Another Bush Administration official suggested that Israel's cooperation with 
China also may accomplish broader strategic objectives by giving Israel at 
least a degree of leverage over China's export of missiles to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The official speculated that Israel's cooperation with China may have been one 
factor that has restrained China from exporting its newly developed M-9 
short-range missiles to countries such as Iraq and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"You can work out the logic yourself," the official said. "China needs the 
technology from Israel, and Israel wants to make sure its enemies don't get new 
Chinese missiles." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the United States objected when it learned that China had sold 
CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles to another Israeli adversary, Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Before the United States gives advanced military hardware or technology to 
Israel, it insists on obtaining assurances that Israel is the end-user and will 
not pass the know-how on to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Asian diplomatic sources said it would be difficult to prove that 
Israel has violated these assurances in its military transfers to China. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the Israelis have a lot of things that come from us," said one 
Defense Department official. "It's hard to tell which of the stuff they are 
giving China is indigenous and what comes from us. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . They (the Israelis) are never caught red-handed. They are never found 
with a missile in their hands. It's always (Israeli) technicians and technology 
transfer. When the Israeli technicians go to China, it's hard to tell what else 
is being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
China regularly portrays itself as a strong friend and supporter of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and of Arab governments in the Middle East. 
But Israel gradually has maneuvered itself into a position where it is now, in 
Miller's words, "a very major supplier" of military technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, Israel and China were working together on military 
projects. The first public demonstration of their cooperation came in October, 
1984, at a military parade in honor of the 35th anniversary of the People's 
Republic of China. Surprised foreign military attaches in Beijing spotted 
self-propelled 105-millimeter guns and cannons of Israeli design mounted on 
China's T-59 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
One Western official assigned to keep track of Israeli military activities in 
China visited China's tank production facilities in the city of Baotou and 
found foreigners who he believed were Israelis working at the plant. The 
Chinese tanks were being equipped with Israeli laser range finders. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years of their military cooperation, China and Israel reportedly 
dealt with one another through third countries. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an Austrian connection," said one Asian diplomat. "They were doing 
it through Vienna." 
</P>
<P>
But as the cooperation deepened, the Israelis began to carry out more and more 
business inside China. China opened a travel office in Tel Aviv two years ago, 
enabling Israelis to obtain visas and travel freely to China. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Israelis operated at first through private trading companies and, 
since early this year, through the liaison office of the Israeli Academy of 
Sciences, located in Beijing's Jianguo Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli scientists moved into the new Beijing office last February, and the 
office is formally opening its doors this week. The office is said to be 
responsible for handling academic exchanges between China and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bush Administration suspended U.S. military sales to China a year ago, 
the action blocked 493 license and contract agreements in which American 
companies were selling equipment or technology to China, according to State 
Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, a State Department spokesman said, 18 special exceptions have 
been granted. However, department officials emphasize, the exceptions are given 
only when American technology is primarily designed for commercial use in 
China, rather than for military or intelligence work. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the continuing uncertainty over the duration and impact of the Bush 
Administration's military sanctions, China earlier this year shelved a deal 
with the United States under which the Grumman Corp. was to supply advanced 
radar and electronic equipment to modernize China's F-8 fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, there have been unconfirmed reports that Israel was 
helping China develop a new jet fighter with technology from the Lavi, an 
advanced combat aircraft that Israel attempted to build with U.S. financial 
backing. In 1987, the United States withdrew support for the Lavi project, and 
Israel was forced to cancel it because of delays and rising costs. The advanced 
engine technology for the Lavi came from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese have very definitely been in the market for a new fighter plane," 
said Miller. "There have been reports that they are developing a new plane 
called the F-12. If it wound up looking like the Lavi, I wouldn't be 
surprised."

A SECOND TRANSPLANT REVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW GENERATION OF ANTI-REJECTION CHEMICALS APPEAR MORE POTENT AND MORE 
SELECTIVE. THEY MAY MAKE ORGAN REPLACEMENT EVEN MORE ROUTINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Every week last year, more than 30 livers and hearts were transplanted in the 
United States in operations that, quite literally, gave the patients months or 
years of extra life. Just eight years ago, only 62 livers and 103 hearts were 
transplanted during the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
That sharp increase was a result of the discovery of an anti-rejection drug 
called cyclosporine, which, by making transplants both safer and more 
effective, revolutionized the field of transplant surgery to the point where a 
major organ is transplanted every 40 minutes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Today, surgeons are experimenting with a new generation of anti-rejection drugs 
that may alter the field every bit as much as cyclosporine did. These drugs are 
more potent than cyclosporine at preventing rejection and, so far at least, 
seem to have fewer side effects. Some also are cheaper -- a not insignificant 
consideration for drugs that must be taken for the remainder of a person's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
But more important, most of the new drugs seem more selective, pinpointing and 
suppressing only the portion of the immune system that attacks the organ and 
leaving the rest free to fight off infections. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hans Sollinger, a transplant surgeon at the University of Wisconsin in 
Madison, predicts that the use of transplant drugs will soon bear a strong 
resemblance to the current situation with antibiotics, where physicians choose 
from among 20 or more drugs to treat a certain type of infection and a certain 
type of patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I foresee a time in the future when we will determine the type of rejection, 
what (immune) cell type is involved, and so forth, open our drawer, and select 
the proper drug for a given organ and a given type of rejection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, transplants will become even more routine than they are now. More 
people who have a defective organ will be able to receive a replacement and 
those replacements will last longer than they do now. 
</P>
<P>
On the darker side, however, these developments will increase the demand for 
donor organs, which are already in short supply. More than 19,000 Americans are 
on waiting lists for donor hearts, kidneys and other organs, and increased 
success rates will make the demand even larger. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts at transplants have been recorded as long ago as Egyptian manuscripts 
written in 2000 BC, but it was not until the 1940s that scientists comprehended 
how to successfully carry out a transplant. During that period, the late Nobel 
laureate Sir Peter Brian Medawar of Oxford University demonstrated definitively 
that transplant failure was caused by the very immune system that protects the 
body against infections. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Medawar's work, researchers realized that it was necessary to stop the 
immune system from attacking an implanted organ as it would a disease-causing 
bacterium. Unfortunately, the only technique available to suppress the immune 
system was whole body irradiation, which destroyed all the immune system cells. 
Several kidney transplants were attempted using this technique. The kidneys 
survived but the patients did not, succumbing to infections. 
</P>
<P>
The first successful kidney transplant was achieved in 1954 by Harvard surgeon 
Joseph E. Murray. He used steroids, hormones that suppress the inflammation 
that is part of the rejection process. Because the steroids did not suppress 
the immune system effectively, he was forced to use organs from living donors 
who were closely related to the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, chemist George Hitchings of the Burroughs Wellcome Co. 
synthesized a derivative of a cancer drug that strongly suppressed the immune 
system. This drug, called azathioprine or Imuran, made transplants practical 
when it was used in conjunction with steroids. Its development made possible 
the first heart, lung, liver and pancreas transplants. 
</P>
<P>
But none of these transplant procedures was successful in more than 65% of the 
patients, and most were much less successful. Furthermore, Imuran's broad 
suppression of the immune system left patients susceptible to a variety of 
infections, as well as to an increased risk of cancer, which is normally kept 
in check by the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
That situation changed dramatically with the 1970 discovery of cyclosporine in 
a fungus from southern Norway. Immunologist Jean Borel of the Swiss 
pharmaceutical firm Sandoz Ltd. showed that it suppressed only a part of the 
immune system -- specifically one type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) called 
the T helper cell. He speculated that the drug thus could reduce the chance of 
rejection while leaving most of the immune system intact to fight off 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
Once surgeons began using cyclosporine in the early 1980s, they never went back 
to Imuran. At Stanford University, the two-year survival rate for heart 
transplants jumped from 63% to 83% by 1985. For kidney transplants throughout 
the United States during the same period, the one-year survival rate leaped 
from 60% to 80%. But liver transplants showed the most dramatic increase, with 
one-year survival rates more than doubling, to 70%. Transplant operations 
flowered as never before. 
</P>
<P>
But cyclosporine had its unfortunate side effects as well. Most critical, it 
damaged the kidney by lowering its clearance of wastes from the blood -- a 
supreme irony in that the drug had made kidney transplants so successful. 
</P>
<P>
It also did not greatly improve survival rates after the first year: Fewer than 
70% of the organs that survived for the first year survived for a second, noted 
Stanford immunologist Randall C. Morris. In practical terms, that attrition 
means many patients, perhaps as many as half of all kidney recipients, are 
coming back for second, third and even fourth organs. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers such as Morris are studying a number of new drugs that they 
think will change that curve for the better. One of the most thoroughly studied 
so far is called FK506. 
</P>
<P>
FK506 was discovered in 1984 by researchers from the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical 
Co. in a soil sample taken only a couple of miles from their laboratory in 
Tsukuba, Japan. They were using what Morris describes as an "extremely 
sophisticated" -- and still largely secret -- system for screening soil and 
water samples to look for anti-rejection drugs. It is the first such agent that 
was not found by accident. 
</P>
<P>
The new chemical belongs to a class of bacterial products called macrolides, a 
family that includes the commonly prescribed antibiotic erythromycin. Fujisawa 
scientists found that FK506 was 30 times more potent than cyclosporine in 
suppressing the immune system, which meant that it potentially be could given 
in much smaller doses to minimize side effects. 
</P>
<P>
But FK506 was almost never used in humans. Immunologist Roy A. Calne of 
Cambridge University in England found that it was toxic in dogs, and his report 
in the British journal The Lancet caused many researchers to abandon their 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
But surgeon Thomas E. Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 
found that the toxicity varied from species to species. More important, he 
found that the drug could greatly extend the survival of transplants in animals 
other than dogs and that it could rescue organs suffering acute rejection 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, 28-year-old Robin Ford was brought into the University 
Hospital in Pittsburgh because she was undergoing an acute kidney rejection. 
Starzl decided to use FK506 in conjunction with cyclosporine to try to rescue 
the organ. The combination proved extremely toxic to Ford, but when Starzl took 
a gamble and stopped using cyclosporine, FK506 stopped the rejection episode. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the cyclosporine had already destroyed Ford's kidney, but she 
received FK506 along with a second donor organ and is back at work for the 
first time in two years. Most important, Starzl had seen the potential of the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
Starzl has used the drug in more than 300 liver and kidney transplant patients 
with uniformly good results. Interestingly, Morris said, the drug not only 
halts rejection episodes, it also stimulates regrowth and repair of damaged 
liver cells. "No other drug does that," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Starzl said that most patients who receive the drug leave the hospital within 
two weeks after a liver transplant, about half the recuperation time required 
with cyclosporine. They also have fewer rejection episodes, infections and, so 
far at least, side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the improved recuperation time, Starzl predicted that the cost of 
liver transplants will be reduced by at least one-third from the current level 
of about $200,000, and that cost reductions also will be achieved with other 
types of transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical trials of the drug at other medical centers are expected to begin 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of other drugs that promise to improve on FK506 are being studied at 
Stanford and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
To speed up research on the drugs, Morris has developed an innovative 
technique: He takes small pieces of heart tissue from one strain of mouse and 
places them between the cartilage and skin in the ears of mice from a different 
strain. Blood vessels grow into the heart tissue and within four to six days, 
the muscle tissue begins beating, although it is not pumping blood. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't treat the recipient, it will be rejected in 10 days," he said. "We 
can treat it with new drugs to see how long the hearts beat. This has really 
speeded up the process of drug discovery and development." If drugs appear 
promising, they are tested in rats and monkeys before trials in humans. "When 
we test them head-to-head like this, we can make clear distinctions among them 
and see what the role of each will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One new drug that Morris considers promising is rapamycin, a close relative of 
FK506 that was discovered in the 1970s by researchers from Ayerst Laboratories 
in Canada who were looking for antibiotics to fight yeast infections. 
</P>
<P>
Rapamycin was a good antibiotic, Morris said, but it also interfered with the 
immune system, so it was shelved. But it was that very property -- plus the 
fact that it has a molecular structure much like that of FK506 -- that prompted 
Morris to evaluate it as an anti-rejection drug. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect it to be much different from FK506," Morris said. "I was very, 
very surprised because in rats it is very potent" -- about 60 times as potent 
as cyclosporine and twice as potent as FK506. "It's the most potent drug we've 
ever seen." Morris hopes to begin testing rapamycin in primates this year. 
</P>
<P>
Morris has high hopes for another drug called RS-61443 because it operates by a 
completely different mechanism than FK506 and other macrolides and thus may be 
able to intervene at a different stage of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Morris has tested RS-61443 in all three animal systems -- mice, rats and 
monkeys -- and found that it could prevent rejection and reverse advanced 
rejection. It is particularly promising, said Wisconsin's Sollinger, who has 
also tested it in dogs, because it combats chronic rejection, which none of the 
other available drugs does. 
</P>
<P>
Sollinger used the drug -- which is routinely used to treat the skin disease 
psoriasis -- for the first time in a human transplant patient in April, and he 
and researchers at the University of Alabama plan to study it in more kidney 
transplant patients. Morris said that the Stanford team plans to test RS-61443 
in heart transplant patients, perhaps as early as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Two other drugs deserve mention. One is deoxyspergualin, a bacterial product 
that "is more impressive than FK506 in some species, particularly primates," 
said surgeon Robert Corry of the University of Iowa Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Deoxyspergualin already has been used successfully for a small number of kidney 
transplants in Japan and kidney and pancreas transplants in Europe. Corry is 
head of a group of U.S. investigators who plan to begin testing the drug in 
humans this summer. The test group will consist of patients receiving a second 
kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be dealing with a population for which there is a 60% success rate 
rather than 90%" as is the case with first kidney transplants, he said. "If we 
have a success there, it will be more clear-cut than it would be with patients 
who are already doing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
The other drug that is attracting interest is not new, but it is one that was 
largely discredited 25 years ago. Thalidomide was developed as a tranquilizer 
and a sleeping aid, but those uses were abandoned after it caused unusually 
severe limb deformities in almost 12,000 European children whose mothers took 
the drug while they were pregnant; the drug was never approved for use in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore are 
finding that it is useful in treating recipients of bone marrow transplants, 
which are used for the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as chronic 
myelogenous leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
These transplants are unusual because the transplanted organ -- bone marrow -- 
is the source of lymphocytes and thus part of the immune system. When the 
transplant goes bad, the body does not reject the transplant: The transplanted 
organ rejects the body. This graft-versus-host disease, which affects nearly 
half of the 2,000 cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplants each year, 
causes severe damage to the recipient's tissues, even death. 
</P>
<P>
Thalidomide, said oncologist Georgia B. Vogelsang of Hopkins, is the only drug 
that has been shown to reverse graft-versus-host disease in animals once it has 
started. 
</P>
<P>
Vogelsang and her colleagues have treated about 100 patients with thalidomide, 
and were successful in reversing graft-versus-host disease in about 60 of them. 
In half the other cases, she noted, the drug was not absorbed by the patient's 
body and thus never had a chance to function. 
</P>
<P>
The only significant side effects she has observed, Vogelsang said, are 
sleepiness and mild constipation. Birth defects are not a problem because the 
radiation used to destroy a patient's own bone marrow before the transplant 
sterilizes the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers still do not know completely what to expect with all these new 
drugs. "We're still in our infancy with all these things," Corry said. But they 
all hold out high hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main message to people who will need transplants is to have hope and 
patience because there are some nice therapeutics out there," Morris said. 
"There really is a light at the end of the tunnel."

$2.3-BILLION TAX INCREASE URGED TO FIGHT STATE DEFICIT 
</P>

<P>
Democratic budget and tax committee chairmen, setting the stage for a showdown 
with Gov. George Deukmejian and Republican legislators, unveiled a plan Tuesday 
to raise state taxes $2.3 billion annually to head off a potential budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The tax proposals would hit affluent Californians the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
By outlining what would be the largest state tax increase in recent years, the 
two committee chairmen were first out of the blocks with a concrete plan to 
close a $3.6-billion funding gap. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal follows passage of Proposition 111, the gasoline tax increase 
measure approved by voters in the June 5 primary election and seen by many 
lawmakers as a signal that Californians are willing to pay more for government 
services if a case can be made that the money is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The new tax plan was proposed by Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman 
of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, and Assemblyman Johan Klehs 
(D-San Leandro), chairman of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the plan would raise the top personal income tax bracket 
back to 11%. The top bracket was lowered to 9.3% in 1987 as part of a major 
restructuring of state tax codes triggered by changes in federal tax law 
enacted in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake. It's time to admit it was a mistake," Klehs said. 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the 11% bracket for single taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 a year 
and couples filing joint returns on incomes of $200,000 or higher would 
generate $1.1 billion in new tax revenues, Alquist and Klehs said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten other measures in the Democrats' tax package, which include a sales tax on 
candy, a new tax on oil and reduction in amounts businesses can write off for 
business lunches, would add another $1.2 billion, the lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the rest of the $3.6-billion deficit would be closed by reductions in 
the size of the proposed budget reserve and a 5.2% across-the-board cut in 
various state programs. 
</P>
<P>
Klehs said he and Alquist came up with the plan at the urging of their 
Democratic colleagues as an alternative to deep cuts being suggested by 
Deukmejian. Those cuts would hit hardest at human services programs providing 
aid to welfare recipients, the elderly, the mentally ill and others who benefit 
by health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
Klehs said high-income taxpayers, oil companies and corporations that provide 
executives with "three-martini lunches" were targeted because they were the 
chief beneficiaries of tax changes in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In comments reflecting the spirit of the proposal, Klehs told reporters during 
a Capitol news conference: "The state of California should not be subsidizing 
their (business) lunch. We should be subsidizing the lunches of poor people, 
people who are in need, people who are on limited incomes, and not wealthy 
people who simply write it off." 
</P>
<P>
Klehs said the proposal will be amended into a bill carried by Alquist and will 
be heard first in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating that it will face rough going, Assemblyman William P. Baker 
(R-Danville), vice chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said: 
"The governor and Republicans are adamantly opposed to any new tax increases, 
and I don't expect to see any in the (budget balancing) package. . . . I don't 
think soaking the few is going to balance the state budget." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Republican consensus was forming around the idea that the budget 
problem can be solved through budget cuts. Republicans contend that the problem 
stems from the fact that, while state revenues are growing by a relatively 
healthy 7%, various legally required health and welfare entitlement programs 
and other costs are driving up expenditures at an annual rate of 11%. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to reduce our spending back to the 6% or 7% level that we can 
afford. It is going to be painful, but we are going to do it," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Drafts of a new state budget in the Assembly and Senate put the spending and 
taxing package in the $56-billion range, but they are badly out of balance, 
containing far more in proposed services and programs than the state can afford 
under the current tax structure. Similarly, the $53-billion budget proposal 
being pushed by Deukmejian works only if Democrats agree to make up nearly all 
of the $3.6-billion shortfall through budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the governor and top legislative leaders have indicated a willingness 
to talk about tax increases but have shied away from suggesting or endorsing 
concrete proposals. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deukmejian has indicated he is opposed to the kind of proposal 
outlined by Klehs and Alquist. Michael R. Frost, Deukmejian chief of staff, 
said the governor believes a large tax increase, without changing laws that are 
driving up costs at an 11% annual rate, would be like "pouring gasoline on a 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) was noncommittal when 
questioned about the Klehs-Alquist proposal. "I don't know where it will go, 
but it's certainly worthy of dialogue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Klehs said Republican criticism of his plan reflects a desire by GOP lawmakers 
"to find $2.8 billion in revenue without pain. I don't think the enormity of 
the problem has even begun to set in with the governor and Republican 
legislators."

SOVIETS PROPOSE GERMAN LINK TO BOTH EAST, WEST 
</P>

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, trying to assure the Soviet Union's security in 
a Europe that he sees likely to be dominated by Germany once it is reunified, 
proposed Tuesday that the new German state become an associate member of both 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that such a dual status could be the first step toward ending 
the Cold War division of Europe into rival military blocs and the formation of 
a new all-European security system. 
</P>
<P>
Although Western diplomats saw new flexibility in the Soviet position, 
Gorbachev's proposal was quickly rejected by President Bush in Washington and 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a proposal we consider realistic," Kohl declared. "We reject it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who had discussed the suggestion with Gorbachev during their summit 
meeting in Washington this month, told reporters, "Our position is well-known 
to him -- a unified Germany should be in NATO with no conditions." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, reporting on his talks with Bush to the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's legislature, was more thinking aloud and attempting to bring forth 
new ideas from the West than outlining a hard-and-fast Kremlin position. 
</P>
<P>
"As a hypothesis, I could suggest some form of associated membership of the new 
Germany in the two alliances, at least while they still exist," he said. "Such 
dual membership could become a new form of unifying element, a kind of 
forerunner of new European (security) structures." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, suggesting that the two alliances transform themselves into 
political groupings, said changes in North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
military doctrine would ease Soviet concerns about German membership in the 
Western alliance. "Within such a framework, a new solution could be found for 
ensuring security for a united Germany," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Setting out yet another idea, Gorbachev proposed a transition during which the 
present West German army would remain under the NATO command, the East German 
army would be under the new German government and Soviet and U.S. troops would 
remain there to ensure stability. 
</P>
<P>
Later in his speech, Gorbachev said he had told Bush that the Soviet Union 
"could agree to a united Germany's NATO membership if the United States 
accepted the idea of associate membership and the principle of the convergence 
of (military) blocs in combination with the German reunification process," 
apparently dropping the condition of membership in the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
International talks on the military status of the future German state enter a 
crucial phase in 10 days, when the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the 
Soviet Union and the United States, the victorious Allied powers of World War 
II, meet in Berlin with their counterparts from East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet there, but there is a lot of movement," a Western ambassador 
said, appraising Gorbachev's speech. "The important thing is not to look at 
each idea, each proposal, each 'hypothesis,' if you will, but at the direction, 
the trend, the underlying shifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying that Germany could be a member of NATO under certain conditions is a 
long journey from insisting that it be neutral." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, after accepting the idea of German reunification after years 
of opposition, had originally proposed neutrality for a unified Germany and, 
when that was rejected, put forward a series of other ideas, including full 
membership in both alliances, a new security grouping for Europe to replace 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact -- and even Soviet membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's lengthy discussion of German reunification Tuesday reflected the 
great sensitivity the question has for the Soviet Union, which lost about 27 
million people in World War II, as well as Moscow's search for a new balance of 
power in Europe after the virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I told President Bush that, instead of developing a fixation on the membership 
of a unified Germany in NATO, would it not be much better to think about how to 
bring closer to each other the alliances that still divide Europe?" Gorbachev 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, reminding the West of Soviet sensitivity on German 
reunification, also warned that, unless Moscow is satisfied that its security 
is assured, it will rethink its entire foreign policy if the West forces the 
issue of German membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
"If we develop the feeling that our interests are being neglected in the 
process of German reunification, then developments in Europe will be seriously 
jeopardized," he said. "This is not a bluff. We would be forced by the 
fundamental interests of our people to pause and take a close look at the 
situation. Needless to say, we would not like to do this." 
</P>
<P>
West German government officials in Bonn saw Gorbachev's proposal as a sign 
that Moscow is still searching for a clear position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at six or seven different formulas on the NATO issue from 
Gorbachev alone in recent months," commented one official. "If you include 
(Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze and others, the number is 
larger still. Today's speech only makes it clear there is no fixed idea, but 
Gorbachev wants to impress the public that he's working hard on it." 
</P>
<P>
The officials in Bonn interpreted Gorbachev's remarks as being intended mostly 
for Soviet domestic consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to give him room to deal with his own public opinion," commented one 
official. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a senior Bush Administration official echoed that theme: "I 
think we very clearly are seeing an evolution in Soviet views . . . as they 
deal with the domestic problems that a unified Germany in NATO creates for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration continues to believe that over time, Gorbachev will move 
toward acceptance of the U.S. position, the official said. But, he added, the 
Soviet president must move slowly to prepare his citizens for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The German officials said they expect little give on the delicate NATO issue by 
Gorbachev before next month's Soviet Communist Party Congress or the NATO 
summit scheduled for the following week. That summit is likely to emphasize the 
growing political character of the Western alliance, a development that would 
make NATO membership for a united Germany easier for Moscow to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
As the Bush Administration official put it, changes will be proposed to NATO 
designed "to reassure Gorbachev and the Soviets that NATO is not necessarily 
only pointed at them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Western recognition of Soviet sensitivities reflected in such 
comments, some Kremlin officials are already beginning to express unhappiness 
with what they regard as a lack of response from the West. 
</P>
<P>
Oleg Baklanov, the Communist Party secretary in charge of the defense industry, 
told the Novosti Press Agency in an interview published Tuesday that the West 
is trying to gain unilateral advantages in Europe and tip the balance of power 
in its favor.

Washington, contributed to this report.

CREWS PUT OUT ONE MAJOR FIRE ON GULF TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Firefighters boarded the supertanker Mega Borg on Tuesday and put out the fire 
in the vessel's pump room, a major step toward extinguishing the 3-day-old 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since an explosion transformed the vessel into an inferno, 
the tide turned in favor of the hundreds of workers trying to keep the 
oil-laden vessel from sinking into the Gulf of Mexico about 50 miles off the 
Texas coast. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Hoskins, who heads the salvage operation, boarded the ship late in the day 
and told the Coast Guard that he would characterize the fire as "under 
control." But the hope of quickly dousing the remaining flames below decks 
ended as darkness began to fall. 
</P>
<P>
"They are getting closer to a point where they may be able to put foam on the 
fire," said Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene at a mid-day news conference. "At 
this point, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made. But there is still a 
chance for a major problem, a major release (of oil). 
</P>
<P>
"We're still not completely safe from a major release until the fire is out and 
the ship is stabilized and it is brought on an even keel." 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard revised its estimate of the amount of oil remaining on the 
water to less than 2,000 gallons, down from the 100,000 gallons estimated 
earlier. The total amount spilled from the tanker, which was carrying 38 
million gallons, has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said that the tanker did not seem in danger of sinking and that he hoped 
the foaming operation would begin in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But as the hours dragged on in the afternoon, Smit American, the salvage 
company in charge of the firefighting, continued to hold back on laying down 
the foam. The company said that, if the metal was too hot, there could be 
recurring explosions that could undo all the progress made thus far. 
</P>
<P>
An expert in marine and refinery firefighting criticized Smit American's 
handling of the fire Tuesday, saying the company could have used equipment in 
Texas rather than sending to Europe for it. The transport of the equipment 
delayed the beginning of the actual firefighting by two days, by which time the 
ship had begun to list, waves were washing on the stern deck and thousands of 
barrels of oil were spewing from the stern. 
</P>
<P>
"We have $600,000 worth of firefighting equipment in a Port Neches warehouse," 
said Les Williams, one of the owners of Williams, Boots &amp; Coots, which is 
based in Port Neches, Tex. "If they (the tanker owner) would have called us on 
Saturday morning, Monday morning would have been Miller time." 
</P>
<P>
Williams took issue also with Smit American's contention that high temperatures 
delay foaming. 
</P>
<P>
Smit American could not be reached for comment. The company is a well-known 
salvage and tow operator that in recent years also has been fighting marine 
fires. Greene of the Coast Guard endorsed the company. "If this were my spill, 
I would go out and hire the people doing it right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill began on Saturday morning, when the supertanker was transferring its 
cargo onto another tanker for transport to the port of Houston. Just after 1 
a.m., an explosion rocked the pump house, through which the transferred oil 
must pass, and blew off the roof of the room in the stern of the ship. Two men 
were killed and two others are missing and presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in the stern spread to the engine room and the living quarters, and, 
about 24 hours after the first explosion, there were five more blasts in the 
interior. The damage from those explosions allowed light crude to escape from 
at least one of the 16 compartments on board, sending it rolling afire over the 
stern deck and into the water. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the amount of oil spilling into the water steadily increased through 
the day as the tanker began to list. By late afternoon, waves were crashing 
over the stern deck. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday brought more promise. Smoke surrounded the superstructure of the 
886-foot vessel, but the flames on the water were out, as was the fire in the 
pump room. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fleet of oil skimmers worked around the crippled tanker, trying to 
keep the crude spill from widening. Jim O'Brien, who is serving as a technical 
adviser for the cleanup, said the oil was, for the most part, a very thin sheen 
on the water that should dissipate before it came anywhere close to shore. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that the opportunity to reach the shoreline doesn't 
exist," he said. "I do not see how it could possibly strand itself on the 
beaches of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
He, as well as the Coast Guard, was unable to predict just how much of the Mega 
Borg's cargo had been released from the tanker. O'Brien said no more than 400 
barrels of oil had been recovered. Much of the oil was eliminated because it 
was consumed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Mega Borg is carrying more than three times amount of oil spilled by the 
Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989. That spill was the nation's 
worst.

VAN DE KAMP SUES FIRM OVER CLAIMS IN 'HEFTY' BAG ADS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and attorneys general in six other states filed 
consumer protection lawsuits Tuesday against the maker of Hefty brand plastic 
trash bags alleging that Mobil Chemical Co. used false advertising to sell its 
so-called degradable bags. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, alleges that Mobil 
has misled the public with claims that its plastic bags are good for the 
environment and break down when exposed to the elements. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the suit claims, the bags will not degrade when used in the usual 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Such advertising seizes upon the public's desire to do what is best for the 
environment and then preys on that desire to sell products," Van de Kamp said 
in a statement. "We cannot let such advertising fool customers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for an injunction to halt the use of the allegedly misleading 
claims and for civil penalties of at least $500,000. Van de Kamp was joined in 
his action by the attorneys general of Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, 
Texas, Washington and Wisconsin -- who filed similar suits against Mobil 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Allen H. Gray, a spokesman for the Virginia-based company, denied that the 
labeling is misleading. But he said that, because many consumers are confused, 
Mobil already has agreed to remove claims of degradability from its packaging 
until guidelines can be established. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's a morass out there," Gray said, adding that Mobil has 
volunteered to lead a joint industry-government effort to standardize 
specifications for degradable products. "But you don't achieve anything with 
litigation," he said. "We've got a strong case. We'll fight if we have to. But 
the other alternative is much more productive." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Blanke, Minnesota's assistant attorney general for consumer protection, 
agreed that the definitions of terms like degradable, recyclable or 
environmentally safe are too vague. But like California's suit, Minnesota's 
accuses Mobil of intentionally deceiving buyers of Hefty bags. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's suit concurs. It claims that Mobil fails to tell consumers that 
its theories about degradability are unproved; and that even if they were true, 
consumers would have to expose their trash bags to the sun, wind and rain for 
weeks or months until the bags began to degrade. If used in the customary way 
-- shipped to local landfills -- the bags are not exposed to the elements long 
enough to trigger the degrading process, the suit claims.

EVIDENCE LINKS JAPANESE FIRM TO EPIDEMIC IN 1989; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: A POTENTIALLY FATAL BLOOD AND MUSCLE AILMENT HAS BEEN TIED TO 
IMPURITIES IN THE MANUFACTURER'S SUPPLY OF THE DIETARY SUPPLEMENT L-TRYPTOPHAN.

<P>
Researchers Tuesday presented the strongest evidence to date linking the 
dietary supplement L-tryptophan made by a Japanese manufacturer to an epidemic 
of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in the United States in the fall of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
They also announced that specific impurities in the tryptophan produced in late 
1988 and early 1989 by the chemical company, Showa Denko of Tokyo, is being 
investigated as a possible cause of the potentially fatal blood and muscle 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan from Showa Denko "is largely if not exclusively responsible for the 
problem in the United States," said Dr. Michael Osterholm, the Minnesota state 
epidemiologist, citing Minnesota studies and data from state health officials 
in New Mexico, New York, Oregon and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. "No 
one presented data to refute that." 
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of some of the impurities correlates very highly with the 
case-associated materials" from Showa Denko, said Larry Needham of the Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
But Osterholm, Needham and others cautioned that far more must be learned about 
the ailment and its cause before sales of products containing tryptophan are 
resumed. For example, Needham said, the specific impurities must be fully 
identified and then shown to cause a similar disease in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
The first comprehensive medical meeting on eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was 
organized by Dr. Phillip Hertzman, a Los Alamos family practitioner who helped 
discover the illness last October. 
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 1,500 eosinophilia-myalgia cases, including 27 deaths, have 
been reported to federal health officials, and many patients remain seriously 
ill. Patients have high concentrations of eosinophils, a type of white blood 
cell that is usually uncommon, severe muscle pains and, depending on severity, 
other problems, such as nerve damage, lung damage and significant skin 
thickening. 
</P>
<P>
The number of new cases has dropped precipitously, but a handful of illnesses 
continue to develop. Despite warnings, some individuals continue to use hoarded 
tryptophan supplies. Others have become ill several months after they stopped 
using the supplement. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan was widely used -- perhaps by as many as 2% of adults, primarily 
non-Latino white women -- before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered 
a total recall of the product last November. The most common reasons were 
sleeping difficulties, anxiety, depression and premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Showa Denko was the largest supplier of the bulk amino acid supplement to the 
American firms that packaged and marketed the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur I. Holleb, an American physician who advises Showa Denko, said that 
the company acknowledges the "statistical association" between its tryptophan 
and the development of the illness, but believes that "there is still a long 
ways to go to firmly establish the causative factor." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, health officials from Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico and New 
York presented data showing that about 95% of the eosinophilia-myalgia cases 
they had studied extensively could be traced to Showa Denko. 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, state health department and Mayo Clinic researchers have 
identified specific changes in Showa Denko's manufacturing techniques that 
appear to be related to increased amounts of an impurity in the company's 
tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Showa Denko produces tryptophan from sugars and other nutrients through 
bacterial fermentation. After the fermentation is complete, the chemical is 
isolated and purified so that it is about 99% pure. 
</P>
<P>
The specific manufacturing changes appear to involve a new strain of bacteria 
introduced into the fermentation and a decrease in the concentration of 
activated charcoal used in the purification process, said Dr. Edward Belongia 
of the Minnesota Health Department. Both of these changes occurred in late 1988 
and early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota researchers call the "signature" impurity "peak E," a reference to 
its appearance on the high-performance liquid chromatography laboratory tests 
that were used to identify the material. The researchers do not know exactly 
what the impurity is, but they said it may belong to a family of organic 
chemicals known as "indoles" that are structurally related to tryptophan. 
Before 1988, this impurity was also present, but in virtually undetectable 
amounts.

<P>
It's said that in 1850 this Mother Lode town declared itself the Great Republic 
of Rough and Ready -- or so the story goes. 
</P>
<P>
The nation lasted just 12 weeks, but the town with the long and colorful name 
has been celebrating ever since. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as usual, Rough and Ready is marking its flirtation with 
independence with Secession Days, a two-month festival ending the last Sunday 
of this month. And, as usual, the town's historian, Constance Bear, 65, a 
reporter for a weekly newspaper, is asking for help in verifying the early 
history.

<P>
"For years I have searched libraries, written letters to the Library of 
Congress and the U.S. Archives trying to get information about the Great 
Republic, to no avail," Bear laments. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no documentation . . . no newspaper accounts, no letters from those 
who were here describing what went on." 
</P>
<P>
But tradition has it that the Gold Rush camp declared itself independent from 
California and the United States in reaction to a mining tax that incensed 
local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
At a mass protest meeting reportedly held April 7, 1850, Col. E.F. Brundage 
supposedly delivered a manifesto creating a new nation. The republic enacted 
its own laws, elected its own officers, including Brundage as president. 
</P>
<P>
But the 3,000 miners and others who lived here soon tired of being an 
independent republic and after 12 weeks threw in the towel. They rejoined the 
union on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
These sparse details of the Great Republic are duly recorded on an historical 
plaque in the center of town and in brochures about the community's history. 
</P>
<P>
Bear said she has a hard time believing that more of a record doesn't exist 
about something as momentous as the declaration of a new nation, yet the few 
references to the event are passing mentions in local history books, the 
earliest-known published in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
A "History of Nevada County" published in 1880, for instance, reports that "It 
was during the uncertainty of the 1850s . . . that Col. E.F. Brundage conceived 
the idea of a separate and independent government. He issued a high-sounding 
manifesto and called a mass meeting. The whole affair was severely ridiculed 
and soon The State of Rough and Ready vanished like the mist." 
</P>
<P>
Historian Bear muses that "surely if it happened, there must be descendants of 
miners who were here who wrote letters to relatives back East that are tucked 
away in attics somewhere. My hope is that someday, someone finds something 
written at the time it happened about the existence of the Great Republic of 
Rough and Ready." 
</P>
<P>
Recorded details or not, for this sleepy little hamlet, population 4,000, some 
60 miles northeast of Sacramento, Secession Days are the biggest celebration 
each year. Something special happens each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the celebration, retired cowboy and stagecoach maker Jim West, 75, 
endowed with a great flowing white beard, led a caravan of nine covered wagons 
and 40 horses three nights and four days along the old Immigrant Trail from 
Rough and Ready 30 miles to Wheatland. The group camped out all along the way. 
</P>
<P>
One weekend there was a parade of old cars and on another, a children's parade. 
There has been a chili cook-off, a peddler's fair and several other events. 
</P>
<P>
The Secession Days weekends culminate in the staging of a festival highlighted 
by the traditional outdoor performance of the play "The Saga of the Great 
Republic of Rough and Ready." 
</P>
<P>
The town came by its unusual name in 1849 when Capt. A.A. Townsend and a party 
of 25 gold miners who came West from Wisconsin founded the place. Townsend 
served in the Army under Zachary (Rough and Ready) Taylor, America's 12th 
President, and named the town after his hero. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rough and Ready retains many vestiges of its past, from William Fippin's 
1850s blacksmith's shop to the 1854 frame Grange Hall and the quaint clapboard 
Rough and Ready School that served five generations of the town's children 
until it closed in 1953.

The Liberian government and rebels began peace talks in Freetown, Sierra Leone. 
Liberia Radio quoted President Samuel K. Doe as saying he would welcome an 
international peacekeeping mission to his West African nation if it is agreed 
to at the talks. In Liberia, officials took journalists to the international 
airport, 35 miles from Monrovia, to prove that contrary to rebel claims, the 
government controls the airport.

But Bryson said that "the Justice Department's antitrust division no longer has

Southern California and the West. Merger opponents were uncertain what impact 
the agreement would have on the ongoing state Public Utilities Commission 
merger review. "We haven't seen anything in writing yet, but my understanding 
is that we're still pursuing our (antitrust) case" through the PUC, state 
attorney general's office spokeswoman Regina Birdsell said.

ENERGY: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORTEDLY HAS REACHED AGREEMENT WITH SDG&amp;E

<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice has reached an agreement with Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric that "adequately resolves" 
antitrust issues generated by the utilities' proposed merger, Edison Executive 
Vice President John E. Bryson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman was not available late Tuesday for comment on 
the agreement, but Bryson said that with the negotiated settlement in place, 
"the Justice Department's antitrust division no longer has any concerns" about 
the proposed merger's impact on utility competition in Southern California and 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
"These conditions adequately resolve any concerns they might have had about 
competition," Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hammered out during negotiations that began in April, shortly 
after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission completed fact-finding hearings 
on the proposed merger, Bryson said. While the Justice Department did not take 
a formal position on the merger during those hearings, its antitrust division 
subsequently raised anti-competition concerns, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain Tuesday afternoon whether the agreement would eliminate 
antitrust and anti-competition objections raised by state Atty. Gen. John Van 
de Kamp and state Public Utilities Commission staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is indeed the case, then as we've said before, (Edison Chairman) 
Howard Allen has friends in high places," San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who 
had not yet seen the agreement, said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also had not yet seen the final agreement reached by the Justice 
Department and the utilities, but "we were sufficiently concerned with a 
previous version that Van de Kamp personally contacted the head of the Justice 
Department's antitrust division," Special Assistant Atty. Gen. Mike Strumwasser 
said Tuesday. Van de Kamp "spent an hour on the telephone . . . telling him why 
(the department) doesn't seem to understand this case very well," Strumwasser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego-based consumer group, described the agreement as "a step in the right 
direction" because "it's Edison's first concession that there would indeed be 
anti-competitive problems associated with the merger. . . . But I don't think 
the conditions are going to appease the state attorney general, the PUC's 
Division of Ratepayer Advocates or the utilities in this region." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson, however, maintained that the Justice Department agreement would "refine 
and advance the pro-competitive elements of this merger (as described in) our 
initial filings with" federal and state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department will file its official version of the agreement with the 
FERC later this week, Edison spokesman Lew Phelps said. Justice Department 
officials believe that the conditions in the agreement "adequately resolve any 
concerns" about antitrust and anti-competition issues, he said. "The adequately 
resolve phrase is language that they have specifically authorized us to use in 
our FERC filings." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached would force the merged companies to give other utilities 
limited access to the extensive web of transmission lines that Edison and 
SDG&amp;E own in California and the West should federal and state officials 
approve the $1.5-billion stock-swap merger. 
</P>
<P>
The combined companies' transmission grid would play a vital role for utilities 
that hope to buy and sell -- and then transmit -- electrical power that is 
generated at coal-fired plants in the Southwest and hydropower plants in the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Tuesday, utilities would compete for available 
transmission space on the combined utility companies' transmission lines 
through a bidding system designed in part by a Justice Department economist, 
Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and a group of municipally owned electric utilities in cities such as 
Orange, Anaheim and Colton have been feuding about transmission access for more 
than 20 years. Strumwasser on Tuesday suggested that it would be difficult for 
the Justice Department's agreement to solve that longstanding argument.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: AFTER FOUR YEARS OF WORK, SHE'S THE 
ULTIMATE QUIRK IN THE LAW, BAR NONE

<P>
Warning: The following item could be harmful to the psychological health of law 
school graduates who are burdened by student loans but still cannot pass the 
California Bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
The item: Suzanne M. Quirk, 31, just learned that she passed the three-day exam 
given this spring. 
</P>
<P>
She passed on her first try. Without ever attending law school. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1985, Quirk decided to study law with her husband, Charles E. Quirk, a 
lawyer who does criminal defense, family matters and personal injury cases. 
</P>
<P>
California is one of only seven states that still allow people to become 
lawyers without going to law school. 
</P>
<P>
There are rules, however: The would-be lawyer must study for four years with a 
lawyer or judge, submit periodic progress reports and take the "baby bar" after 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
Quirk did these things and a few more, too. 
</P>
<P>
Like working full time in her husband's Pacific Beach office and also giving 
birth to their first child, Seamus, now 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week of giving birth, Quirk was back at work, answering phones and 
doing research. A playpen was set up in the office. 
</P>
<P>
"It got tough sometimes," said Quirk. "Seamus would crawl all over me, and tell 
me to put down my book. But I had to keep studying." 
</P>
<P>
Quirk got a degree in speech pathology/audiology from San Diego State 
University in 1980. She and her husband will now be law partners. 
</P>
<P>
How rare is Quirk's feat? Very rare. 
</P>
<P>
Even with law school, the bar exam can be a bone crusher. The failure rate 
often hovers near 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 breakdown is not yet available, but only 10 of the 12,117 people who 
passed in 1988 and '89 had not gone to law school. Of those 10, only 3 were 
first-timers. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Quirk says that near the end of their fourth year of study, his wife 
started to argue with him over points of law. Argue and win. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she was ready," he said.

JOHS URGES USING COUNTY FOR FIRE, POLICE SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: THE COUNCILWOMAN SAYS THE FINANCIALLY BELEAGUERED CITY WOULD SAVE MONEY 
BY ELIMINATING ITS OWN PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS.

<P>
Faced with trying to resolve Oxnard's financial problems, Councilwoman Ann Johs 
said Tuesday that the city should consider eliminating its police and fire 
departments and turning those services over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said she believes that the financially beleaguered city will be able to 
save a considerable amount of money by hiring the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department and Fire Protection District, as other cities have done. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which is projecting a $2.8-million deficit in the fiscal year 
beginning July 1, had hoped to raise $5 million a year with a 5% utility tax 
increase on the June 5 ballot. The tax was defeated by a 3-to-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Johs' recommendation to study how much money the move would save the city was 
supported by Councilwoman Geraldine (Gerry) Furr. But it sparked immediate 
criticism by one council member and top city police and fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said she would be reluctant to approve a transfer of 
police and fire services to the county. "It would have to be a very compelling 
reason to make me want to change my mind about police services," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi declined to comment until next week, when Johs is expected 
to explain her proposal in detail to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens said despite Oxnard's current fiscal crisis, the city 
can continue to provide more police services than the county Sheriff's 
Department. He added that Oxnard police officers will not be happy to hear of 
Johs' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Oxnard police officers are fiercely proud that they work for the city," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Fire Chief Ted Christensen said that a transfer of fire services to 
the county may save the city money but would probably reduce the level of 
service provided to Oxnard residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Service level has to be the determining factor, not dollar value," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department now has an average three-minute response time to emergency 
calls, he said. If the county were to take over fire services, Christensen 
said, several fire stations could be closed and the response time could 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
But Johs said she recommended the study because she is worried that the city 
will be forced to reduce its police and fire services to dangerously low levels 
due to current financial problems. City Manager David Mora has recommended that 
the city cut 64 positions -- including 16 police officers and eight 
firefighters -- to help avoid a $2.8-million deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said she realizes that her recommendation would be criticized by police 
and fire officials. "I know they are not going to be happy campers, and I'm not 
a happy camper for suggesting it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department spokesman said he believes that Oxnard would save money 
by contracting with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"In cities that we contract, our per capita costs are certainly lower than some 
other cities," Undersheriff Larry Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sheriff's Department took over police services for Fillmore about 
three years ago, Carpenter said, the city saved about $250,000 from its 
$1-million Police Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell said the Sheriff's Department has provided 
his city more law enforcement services than the city provided at a higher cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet you they'll save a lot of money on sheriffs," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Carpenter said taking over Oxnard's police services would be a 
"monumental task" and could take more than six months to execute. Typically 
when a city contracts with the county to take over police services, many of the 
city's police personnel, including administrators, are hired by the Sheriff's 
Department to continue serving the city, he said.

The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to look into 
establishing a citizens review board to monitor the Sheriff's Department, 
following emotional testimony by the father of a Vista man who was killed by a 
reserve deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's at least make the Sheriff's Department think before they try, convict 
and execute on the spot again," said Joe Bray, father of the young man who was 
gunned down last month at his apartment complex. Deputies mistook Jeff Bray for 
a car thief and shot him when he put his pickup truck into reverse and hit the 
patrol car.

The board's decision came on the heels of a grand jury recommendation to create 
a citizens review board independent of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a credibility gap that's been created, and we need to address that 
gap," Supervisor Brian Bilbray said. "We do not have the level of public 
confidence out in the community that we once had." 
</P>
<P>
The board directed its staff to return within 45 days with a report on how to 
establish the review board, set up its authority and responsibilities and 
select its members. 
</P>
<P>
The staff also was told to consider whether it would make sense instead to form 
a second grand jury specifically to investigate, review and monitor the 
sheriff's practices and policies. Such a jury would serve only a one-year term 
and would be appointed by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The review board could be established through an ordinance or a charter 
amendment. The amendment would require a majority vote in an election. The 
ordinance process would create a weaker board that would lack subpoena powers 
or access to sheriff's investigation and personnel files, which are 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Reed, representing Sheriff John Duffy, said a citizens review committee 
would duplicate agencies already in place, such as the Sheriff's Department's 
internal affairs division, the grand jury, the district attorney's office and 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff feels strongly that the grand jury is the proper mechanism for 
reviewing citizens' complaints," Reed told the board. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Susan Golding, who urged the formation of the review board, said 
a grand jury's one-year term would preclude carrying the experience of one jury 
over to the next. 
</P>
<P>
Golding, who supports having the tenure of grand jury members extended to two 
years, said members of successful citizens review boards elsewhere in the 
nation have four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
The independence of a citizens review committee also is important, Golding 
argued, along with the ability to subpoena and other investigative powers. 
</P>
<P>
Elvira Diaz, an aide to Golding, said San Francisco is the only county in the 
state with a citizens review board of its sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, San Diego County had a citizens review board that failed 
because it lacked the investigative powers that a charter entity would have, 
Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has had a citizens review board for the Police Department 
since 1989, after a ballot initiative passed the previous November. 
</P>
<P>
George Penn, director of the city's review board, said the degree of power and 
independence that such a review board needs depends on the severity of the 
problem at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"A review board needs as much power as it takes to get public confidence back," 
Penn said. "It depends on how severe the climate is, and I would judge, in 
light of the recent shooting and the jail over-crowding situation, that the 
sheriff's situation is severe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that you would need a lot of independence to overcome the community 
and legislative doubt about the forthrightness and fairness of the process in 
the Sheriff's Department. It's obvious they've lost that." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, a candidate for sheriff who is backed by Duffy, 
said he would prefer a second grand jury rather than a review board. Jim 
Roache, a Lemon Grove sheriff's captain and Drown's opponent, said he supports 
the creation of an independent citizens review board.

PROJECT FOR MENTALLY ILL GAINS BACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a proposed low-cost housing complex for the mentally ill received 
assurance Tuesday that the project has the backing of a majority of the County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John K. Flynn, a longtime booster of the proposed $4.5-million 
project next to Camarillo State Hospital, said another supervisor, James R. 
Dougherty, has decided to become the crucial third vote needed to keep the 
project on track. 
</P>
<P>
As it is proposed, the county must provide $600,000 to help build the 
condominium project for 150 mentally ill people who are not confined full time 
to a hospital. The federal government has set aside money to cover the 
remaining cost. 
</P>
<P>
Until Dougherty's announcement, only two board members, Flynn and Susan K. 
Lacey, had committed themselves to the project. Others on the five-member 
board, Madge L. Schaefer and Maggie H. Erickson, had said they wanted to wait 
until formal budget hearings before taking a position. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty, the swing vote, was absent during earlier discussions. Tuesday, 
Flynn read the supervisors a note from Dougherty saying, "I am committed to 
supporting the mental health project at budget time, and . . . I believe 
whatever steps are necessary to assure that the project proceeds in a timely 
manner should be taken immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty, who is recovering from throat surgery, was present but did not 
speak. "This is the go-ahead we've been waiting for," Flynn said after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can proceed with getting a lease from the state, arranging for the 
water supply and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
Project supporters cheered when Flynn made the announcement. They had vowed to 
attend board meetings every week until they were assured that the county would 
pay its share of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"This means we have three of the five votes," said John Ellis, representing the 
Friends and Advocates of the Mentally Ill. "It's important to us to have that 
assurance." JACK SEARLES

SOME CABLE TV RATES TO RISE IN SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable TV costs for some Oxnard and Port Hueneme customers will increase this 
summer by as much as $1.50 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Jones Intercable, which serves about 34,000 people in the two cities, will 
charge $16 for basic cable service beginning July 1, a $1 increase over current 
rates. Remote control cable boxes will cost an additional $3.45, a 50-cent 
increase over current rates, said Linda Merkel, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Jones Intercable plans to use much of the increased revenue to purchase backup 
batteries for its satellite receiving stations, Merkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Lombardi, a management analyst for Oxnard, said that the cities of Port 
Hueneme and Oxnard now do not have the power to regulate cable company rates.

<P>
The man who portrayed Mike Fulton on the television sitcom "Punky Brewster" was 
arrested before dawn in Hollywood Tuesday, standing against a car and babbling 
incoherently. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Kent Carter, 33, of Duarte, who goes by the name of T.K., was booked for 
resisting police after he failed to respond to officers' questions, Lt. Dan 
Walliser said. At one point, Carter allegedly took a combative stance, and 
officers used a stun gun on him three times, with no apparent effect.

Two patrol officers saw Carter standing in the middle of Sunset Boulevard at El

OPPONENTS HEAP CRITICISM ON PROPOSED NORTH COUNTY LANDFILL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county staff proposal to create landfills in Fallbrook, the Pauma Valley and 
Warner Springs was soundly thrashed during an all-day public hearing Tuesday 
before the county Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon session at a Fallbrook church hall drew about 500 angry and vocal 
opponents, including country club members, Indians, a Berkeley attorney, an El 
Cajon Catholic priest and lots of neighboring homeowners who claimed that their 
intellectual opposition to landfills has nothing to do with the so-called NIMBY 
("not in my back yard") philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Because only some of the more than 200 would-be speakers got a chance to reach 
the microphone, the hearing was continued to 9 a.m. Friday at the county 
administrative offices in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission said it will not make a decision on what to recommend 
to the County Board of Supervisors until July 20 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
What opponents lacked in tar and feathers they made up with in videos, 
photographs, maps, graphs, charts, slides and even computer-generated drawings 
that depicted what they called "Mount Trashmore" at the Fallbrook site. 
</P>
<P>
One after another, speakers attacked the findings of an environmental impact 
report that they said is so woefully inadequate for each of the three sites as 
to be sure to invite lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney George Foreman, representing the Pala band of Mission Indians, told 
the commission: "The theme we've heard from the county staff can best be 
summarized by two words: Trust us. How can we? 
</P>
<P>
"The EIR is so legally flawed that it won't be able to withstand the legal 
challenge that would certainly happen if it's adopted. The litigation will take 
a long time. Wisdom would be to spare your fellow citizens from having to go to 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Russell, chairman of the Fallbrook Planning Group, complained that since a 
supplemental EIR must be prepared to address many of the landfill issues, 
Tuesday's discussion was futile and a decision to change zoning to accommodate 
the landfills at any of the three proposed sites was premature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to comment on a document that hasn't been written yet. This is one 
of those rush projects where we (county government) don't know how appropriate 
it is, but let's move forward with it anyway," Russell said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also argued that the county was toying with fate in wanting to store 
trash over major aquifers, including one that serves Camp Pendleton and another 
that contributes to the water supply of Escondido and Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Even a member of the Planning Commission challenged a county consultant's 
explanation of how the bottom of the landfills would be lined with a mixture of 
clay and synthetic material to prevent contaminants from entering the ground 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"Will that liner deteriorate in 100 years?" asked David Kreitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that's a possibility," answered Dan Redmond, a consultant for the 
design engineer for the landfill project. The liner "hasn't been around that 
long and put in this application so that we can answer that question." 
</P>
<P>
Another commissioner, Richard Wright, cut to the quick after continued 
discussion about how the landfills would be "state-of-the-art." 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much we sanitize this, we know that what we're talking about is 
a dump," he said. "A dump is a dump is a dump." 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers offered alternative solutions, such as shipping trash to a desert 
site in Riverside County. Don't count on it, Riverside County officials 
responded. They added that they too are opposed to the notion of a landfill in 
Fallbrook because the odor and dust would waft over Temecula and its wine 
country, just three miles away in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside officials also don't much care for the Warner Springs site, 
because trash trucks would have to drive north on Interstate 15 and east -- 
through Temecula -- along California 79 to return to San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Mayor Ron Parks suggested that trash be dumped at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Others said North County's trash should be shipped to South County because 
North County sites are too environmentally sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers complained that the landfill-generated dust would invite insects into 
their groves and orchards. Indians complained that the Pauma Valley site would 
desecrate a sacred rock and nearby mountain that serves as a spiritual icon. 
There were complaints about the cost to the county to condemn expensive 
residential property around the Fallbrook site. Everyone complained about the 
trash truck traffic and the cost of widening roads and highways. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most deficient, incomplete and inadequate environmental impact 
report I've ever seen," said Gordon Tinker, general manager of the Fallbrook 
Public Utilities District. "The county staff should be taken to task." 
</P>
<P>
Lauren M. Wasserman, director of the county Department of Planning and Land 
Use, told the audience, "There is no potential site for a landfill that will be 
acceptable to all of us who live in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
The proposals have so far generated 1,413 letters of opposition -- only a 
fraction of them mass-produced -- that included more than 10,000 comments and 
questions, the county said.

GRAND JURY FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF CRIME IN SWEETWATER DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allegations that computer and car-theft rings were operated out of the 
Sweetwater Union High School District, as well as an allegation of bribery by a 
teacher -- all highly publicized in local media during the past year -- are 
completely unfounded, a lengthy investigation by the San Diego County Grand 
Jury has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Tuesday, the jury said there was no evidence of criminal 
misconduct, and exonerated the South Bay secondary school district from the 
cloud of suspicion under which it has operated since October, 1989, when 
charges were first raised by a former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury did find problems of sloppy record-keeping, as well as instances 
of low morale among some employees. It blamed the latter on the five-member 
Board of Trustees, citing what it called the board's lack of dignity and 
maturity in some dealings with employees. It called for trustees to work with 
seminar consultants to improve employee relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept trying to remind folks that there was no evidence that any crime had 
been committed but were just these allegations," 20-year board member Judith 
Bauer said Tuesday. "As a board, we had insisted that the matter be turned over 
to the district attorney as soon as the allegations were made, and they could 
never find any crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a long-running version of 'Chicken Little, the sky is falling.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bauer acknowledged, however, that the issues of board decorum and policy-making 
procedures are valid for the grand jury to raise. 
</P>
<P>
"There are occasions when board meetings are not good examples of democracy in 
action and where public policy is not being done in a way that the public 
interest is served," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us should take the comments to heart and explore ways to improve our 
conduct of business," she said, adding that teachers and administrators are 
sometimes reluctant to appear before the board because of harsh personal 
criticism directed at them. 
</P>
<P>
The board has been split 3 to 2 on numerous issues for the past several years, 
even in its original vote to hire Sweetwater Supt. Anthony Trujillo in 1985. 
The district runs 18 junior- and senior-high facilities for 27,000 seventh- 
through 12th-grade students. It is the county's second-largest district behind 
San Diego Unified. 
</P>
<P>
Among the grand jury findings: 
</P>
<P>
* There was no basis to an allegation of bribery by a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
* There was no basis to an allegation of a car-theft ring operating out of the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
* There was no basis to reports that some district employees had been taking 
district omputers to schools and organizations in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
* The district properly instituted centralized controls and record-keeping 
recently to solve problems of lack of travel records, use of district vehicles 
and personnel accounting. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grand Jury observes that remedial efforts for control and oversight of 
records are now being made, even as state auditors are examining the district's 
records," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The jury concluded, "Jurors have listened to testimony involving innuendoes and 
rumors, and to information that is misleading or based on half-truths. . . . 
With difficulty, the Grand Jury has sorted out the facts in this report and has 
arrived at its conclusions and recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
It added that the split among trustees "appears to have caused some of the 
electorate and some district employees to perceive that the district's business 
may not be conducted in a reasonable and impartial manner." 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo said Tuesday that "all of this shows that the district is fairly 
well-managed." He said there has been "some looseness" in auditing procedures, 
but argued that the cost of putting additional controls into effect cut into 
funding of classroom-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is to deal with dropout rates and expectations for kids," 
Trujillo said, referring to efforts in the heavily minority district to boost 
the number of college-qualified graduates and reduce its high number of 
dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo said he does not believe that disputes among trustees have affected 
"the daily operation of the school district."

KEY WITNESS DENIES HE THREATENED SILBERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: GOVERNMENT INFORMER CONTRADICTS SILBERMAN'S CLAIM THAT HE WAS COERCED 
INTO MONEY DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asserting that there were no threats, government informer Robert Benjamin said 
Tuesday that he did not pressure Richard T. Silberman into completing the 
second of two deals at the heart of the money-laundering trial against the San 
Diego financier. 
</P>
<P>
Directly contradicting Silberman's testimony on a key defense theme, Benjamin 
said he did not make either of two early 1989 phone calls Silberman claimed to 
have received from the eight-time convicted felon. It was in those calls that 
Benjamin made the threats, Silberman testified last week. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, however, said Tuesday that he did not make the calls because he did 
not have Silberman's phone numbers. He added that he thought it was 
"ridiculous" to suggest he had made threats against Silberman, a one-time aide 
to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Though most of his testimony involved sparring with Silberman's defense 
attorneys, Benjamin never lost his composure. He appeared to be wryly amused at 
once again finding himself in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who is standing trial on seven felony counts, showed no emotion 
as he listened to testimony from Benjamin, a New Yorker who is in the federal 
witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman is charged with laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent 
allegedly characterized as Colombian drug profits. Testimony in his trial, 
which begin May 18 before U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, is due to 
conclude today. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will get the case after closing arguments Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves two transactions involving cash supplied by the undercover 
agent, Peter Ahearn, who was posing as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian 
drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal is a November, 1988, swap of $100,000 for stock in a Silberman 
gold mine subsidiary. The second is a February, 1989, exchange of $200,000 for 
U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman maintains the first deal was simply a legitimate stock sale. As for 
the second, he testified last week that he was coerced into it by threats aimed 
at his family, claiming Benjamin made them in phone calls Jan. 5 and Feb. 4, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
A central element of defense strategy, throughout months of pretrial hearings 
and in questioning of various witnesses during the trial, has been a focus on 
Benjamin and the purported threats. Benjamin testified at the request of 
defense attorneys, not prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, however, lead defense lawyer James J. Brosnahan never asked Benjamin 
at any time Tuesday -- or during Benjamin's initial, brief appearance last 
Friday on the stand -- about the purported January and February threats. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
finally asked whether Benjamin had ever threatened Silberman. "Never," Benjamin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said he could not have made the Jan. 5 phone call to Silberman's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even have his office number," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he also could not have made the Feb. 4 call, which was to 
Silberman's home. "I never had his number," Benjamin said. "I never called 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of asking about the January and February threats, Brosnahan sought 
primarily to ask about various threats and crimes the defense team contends 
Benjamin -- whose eight convictions include bookmaking and bank fraud -- has 
been involved in over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Irving, however, refused to allow Benjamin to answer questions on unrelated 
topics. However, the judge said he may convene a separate hearing to consider 
the defense contention that Benjamin's past made it "outrageous" for the FBI to 
use him in the case against Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan also focused on a March, 1989, meeting involving Benjamin, Carmine 
DiNunzio and Jack Norman Myers. 
</P>
<P>
DiNunzio is an associate of reputed mobster Chris Petti, through whom Silberman 
met Ahearn. Myers, a Malibu investment banker who was charged with being a 
courier in the alleged money-laundering scheme, pleaded guilty in mid-May to 
one felony count and agreed to testify against Silberman, which he did May 31. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, a lunch at an Encino hotel, was called to discuss why the value of 
the bonds that were delivered in the second deal was perhaps $50,000 less than 
Ahearn had expected. Discussing the shortfall, DiNunzio "got threatening," 
Myers testified a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said Thursday that he agreed with DiNunzio that Myers -- and Silberman 
-- had to make up the difference. But he said he "didn't agree with the 
threats," which he called "veiled at best." 
</P>
<P>
The threats have not been explicitly described in court. 
</P>
<P>
Following Benjamin's recital of the lunch conversation, Brosnahan suggested to 
Benjamin that the meeting was "not the first time you've threatened Mr. 
Silberman." "That's an absolute lie," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan immediately contended that since Benjamin was on the FBI payroll, the 
informer had a financial motive to make the case against Silberman a good one. 
</P>
<P>
"I always need money," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "Mr. Silberman needed money, not me. He sent for me. I didn't 
send for him."

A Ventura County Superior Court jury convicted three men Tuesday of selling 
crack cocaine from a dilapidated house in west Ventura in February. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Haynes, 38, was convicted on one count each of maintaining a house for 
illicit narcotics sales and selling crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Duchon Fields, 23, of Ventura was convicted on two counts of selling crack 
cocaine but acquitted on a third count. Dexter Williams, 23, was convicted on 
one count of selling crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
All three were being held in the Ventura County Jail pending their sentencing 
hearing, scheduled for July 10. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested in a Feb. 26 raid on the house at 948 Olive St. by SWAT 
teams from the Ventura Police Department and the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, a police informant testified that she bought small quantities 
of crack at the house from Fields and Haynes on Feb. 13 and from Williams on 
Feb. 14. MACK REED

U.S. APPROVES BORDER SEWAGE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. authorities have given their approval to initial plans to construct an 
almost $200-million binational sewage-treatment complex near the U.S.-Mexico 
boundary line in San Diego, opening the way for a formal agreement between both 
nations, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The consent of U.S. officials to the proposed project is considered an 
important development in resolving the decades-old dilemma of what to do with 
the huge volume of Tijuana sewage that has long befouled farmland, horse 
ranches, beaches and other land in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The consent of U.S. authorities -- including officials from the State 
Department, Environmental Protection Agency and Office of Management and Budget 
-- had been eagerly awaited by proponents of the project. Mexican authorities 
had already given their imprimatur to the informal agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The joint project -- to be financed with U.S. and Mexican funds -- is viewed by 
many as the only viable solution for the cross-border pollution problem, which 
has at times strained relations between the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the informal pact would allow financially strapped Mexico to pay its 
share of the mega-project -- an amount totaling perhaps $41 million -- during a 
10-year period, thus stretching out the fiscal impact. 
</P>
<P>
However, the planned international sewage treatment complex -- an almost 
$200-million project, including an elaborate system of pipelines on both sides 
of the border and an outfall extending 3 miles into the Pacific -- is still far 
from reality. Many questions about its design and ultimate funding remain to be 
worked out. The Bush Administration is seeking $15.7 million to finance design 
work and initial construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment facility, which would treat up to 25 million gallons a day of 
Tijuana-generated wastes, is not slated to be in operation until the end of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. approval sets the stage for signing the formal agreement between the 
governments of the United States and Mexico, said Jose Valdez, a spokesman for 
Narendra N. Gunaji, U.S. representative on the International Boundary and Water 
Commission, the binational U.S.-Mexico body that is proposing to construct the 
huge project. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-area congressional representatives, in a joint statement, said 
Tuesday that the long-awaited U.S. approval should open the way for formal 
binational adoption of a sewage-plant pact as soon as next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is a giant step for the environment," U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery 
(R-Coronado), said in the joint statement. "It is a pleasure to announce that a 
solution is not only at hand but is now inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Added U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, (R-Calif.), "It's a victory for border residents, 
the environment, and all Californians."

STATE SUES MOBIL OVER HEFTY BAGS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: JOHN VAN DE KAMP, ALONG WITH OTHER STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, FILES 
SUIT TO STOP MAKERS OF THE TRASH BAGS FROM CLAIMING PRODUCT IS DEGRADABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Attorney General John Van de Kamp filed a consumer protection lawsuit 
Tuesday against the maker of Hefty brand plastic trash bags, alleging that 
Mobil Chemical Co. used false advertising to sell its so-called degradable 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
The action, filed in San Diego Superior Court, alleges that Mobil has misled 
the public with untrue claims that its plastic bags are good for the 
environment and that the plastic breaks down when exposed to the elements. In 
fact, the suit claims, the bags will not degrade when used in the usual manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Such advertising seizes upon the public's desire to do what is best for the 
environment and then preys on that desire to sell products," Van de Kamp said 
in a statement. "We cannot let such advertising fool customers . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for an injunction to halt the use of the allegedly misleading 
claims and for civil penalties of at least $500,000. Van de Kamp was joined in 
his action by the attorneys general of six other states -- Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, New York, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin -- who filed similar suits 
against Mobil on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Allen H. Gray, a spokesman for the Virginia-based company, denied that the 
labeling is misleading. But he said that because many consumers are confused, 
the company already has agreed to remove claims of degradability from its 
packaging until common guidelines can be established. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's a morass out there," Gray said, adding that Mobil has 
volunteered to lead a joint industry-government effort to standardize 
specifications for degradable products. "But you don't achieve anything with 
litigation. We've got a strong case. We'll fight if we have to. But the other 
alternative is much more productive." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Blanke, Minnesota's assistant attorney general for consumer protection, 
agreed that the definitions of terms such as degradable, recyclable or 
environmentally safe are too vague. But, like California, Minnesota accuses the 
makers of Hefty bags of not merely confusing but intentionally deceiving 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is abundant evidence that Mobil Chemical Co. was fully aware of what the 
facts are, but they deliberately and cynically chose to manipulate public 
perceptions and to ignore the scientific facts for the purpose of making a 
profit," Blanke said. "The only conclusion you can draw is that the marketing 
department got the better of the laboratories." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's suit concurs. It claims that Mobil fails to tell the public that 
its theories about degradability are unproven and that, even if the claims were 
true, consumers would have to expose their trash bags to the sun, wind and rain 
for weeks or months for the breakdown to begin. If used in the customary way -- 
simply shipped to local landfills -- the bags are not exposed long enough to 
the elements to trigger the degrading process, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suit notes, Mobil states on the front of some products that 
they are "for recycling." The suit claims that Mobil explains on the back of 
the package that the term means consumers can see through the bags to better 
keep track of the trash inside, some of which might be recyclable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a traditional kind of false-advertising case involving representations 
made to sell a product that we claim are either deceptive or, if true, 
irrelevant to the products that are being sold," said Al Shelden, California's 
deputy attorney general for consumer law. The suit was filed in San Diego 
County for convenience, not because the company has any ties to the area, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits stem from an informal task force formed in November by the 
National Assn. of Attorneys General in Washington. In December, the task force 
approached several companies to inquire about the meaning of and the basis for 
several pro-Earth advertising claims. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to put a spotlight on this issue, to test whether it was as serious 
a problem as we thought it was," said Blanke, who helped organize a public 
hearing on the issue in mid-March. At that hearing, attended by attorneys 
general from eight states, he said, "there was a broad consensus that there was 
a problem.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former professional football player who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of 
spousal abuse in the 1988 kidnaping of his then-wife was fined Tuesday and 
placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin Jerome Phillips, 30, of San Diego claims he kidnaped his wife in order to 
deprogram her from the influences of a religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
He was ordered to pay the county for the cost of his defense lawyer, a public 
defender, and was fined $500. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who once played for the San Diego Chargers and two other teams, 
originally was charged with kidnaping his wife, Helen Phillips, 28, on June 2, 
1988, from a Rancho Penasquitos supermarket parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference five days later, the couple appeared and she said she had 
been "rescued" from the influences of a religious cult through the help of 
deprogrammer Ted Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
At the same televised news conference, Helen Phillips' father burst in and hit 
his son-in-law in the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have since divorced. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Helen Phillips told Superior Court Judge William Mudd that she did 
not want her ex-husband to go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"He has made a big mistake, but he has learned from it," she said, adding that 
her ex-husband is still supporting their three young boys, who "need their 
father right now." 
</P>
<P>
Mudd gave Phillips credit for nine days in jail already served in 1988, and 
placed him on three years' probation. The prosecutor made no recommendation in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' attorney, Bill Youmans, told the court the offense was committed "for 
love of his wife and family . . . from what he perceived was a danger." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips now works in the insurance business, Youmans said.

<P>
The U.S. Border Patrol on Tuesday seized 1,100 pounds of marijuana that had 
apparently been backpacked into San Diego from Mexico in 10 large duffel bags 
that were found stashed in heavy brush, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second seizure of a so-called "mule train" load of marijuana 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials say the practice of ferrying in loads of illicit 
substances via the many border paths is on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, agents discovered 1,310 pounds of marijuana in the bed of a pickup 
abandoned near Monument Road, in a thinly populated area to the west of the 
port of entry at San Ysidro. Tuesday's seizure took place in about the same 
area, which has long been a favored route for border-jumpers and is 
crisscrossed with their trails. 
</P>
<P>
At about noon Tuesday, a Border Patrol agent approached two people on a trail 
commonly used by undocumented immigrants, according to the agency. One of the 
two drew a revolver from his waistband and both fled into the heavy brush near 
the Tijuana River, authorities said. Neither was apprehended. No shots were 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
The agent followed the two and discovered 10 large duffel bags concealed in the 
brush, authorities said. The bags held smaller, marijuana-filled containers 
similar to those seized on May 28, authorities said. Authorities said they 
suspect that the substances were to be picked up by a smuggling vehicle.

<TEXT>
<P>
The board of the Escondido Union High School District unanimously approved a 
contract Tuesday to hire a replacement for its much-maligned superintendent, 
John Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Gawronski, superintendent of the West Covina Union School District, will 
take the helm of the 5,700-student school district July 16, replacing Cooper, 
whom the school board asked to resign late last year after complaints about his 
management style. 
</P>
<P>
Gawronski, whose three-year contract calls for a starting salary of $85,000 a 
year, has been superintendent at West Covina since 1987, bringing the district 
back from the brink of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
"There are challenges in Escondido, too," Gawronski said. "But the primary 
challenge is a people one, not a fiscal one. Both problems require process 
solutions, because it takes people to provide solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who still had one year left on his contract, will vacate his post June 
30.

BAY CITIES, PORT CONTINUE TALKS OVER SHARING IN THE WEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cash-starved cities ringing San Diego Bay will have to wait two more weeks 
before finding out how much money the Board of Port Commissioners is willing to 
give them from its healthy treasury. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, the five cities in the San Diego Unified Port District -- 
San Diego, National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and Coronado -- have 
attempted to persuade the Port District they need more money for public 
services they provide on port property. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners, all of whom are appointed by the city councils of the five 
cities, have agreed in principle to the idea, especially since several of the 
cities, such as San Diego, are financially strapped while the Port District 
sits on a cash machine. 
</P>
<P>
As custodian of state tidelands around the bay, the Port District is landlord 
of some very profitable projects, including Lindbergh Field, Shelter Island, 
Seaport Village and Harbor Island. 
</P>
<P>
The cities want to share in the port's success. The district has a surplus in 
the bank of more than $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
While the Board of Port Commissioners wants to help -- a position it reaffirmed 
Tuesday -- an agreement has been delayed while the two sides haggle over a 
distribution formula and whether the proposed agreement passes review by the 
state attorney general. Because the Port District was created by an act of the 
Legislature, there are restrictions about how it can spend its money. 
</P>
<P>
The port's executive director, Don Nay, is scheduled to meet today with the 
managers of the five bay cities to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
While the cities and the district have been reluctant to reveal exactly how 
much money is at stake, San Diego officials said Tuesday the city is counting 
on receiving as much as $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who appeared before them, 
commissioners agreed to schedule a decision for June 26, which the mayor said 
is necessary to meet city budget deadlines for the fiscal year beginning July 
1.

WATER RATE DISCUSSION IS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday agreed to Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
request to delay until early August a discussion of new water rates. 
</P>
<P>
The new rates would penalize single-family water customers who use 
substantially more water than the average utility customer. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor argued that discussion of the new rate structure would "send the wrong 
message" to San Diegans who have cut back substantially on water use since a 
voluntary conservation program began June 1. In early August, the council will 
learn whether San Diegans have met the 10% voluntary reduction being sought. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also voiced concerns that, as proposed, the new rates would apply only 
to single-family homes, not to apartments or condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The five-tiered water rate program is supposed to promote conservation by 
raising the rates as more water is used. The proposed program would replace a 
single-price program now in place.

TRAFFIC CONGESTION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "On a Highway to Nowhere" (Commentary, May 21) does a grave 
disservice to government and industry partners who are willing to try a 
technical solution to a severe social problem, traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The article was inaccurate: It will not cost $80,000 per auto. 
</P>
<P>
The $8 million allocated to the smart car project in Orlando will not only 
include 100 specially equipped cars, but also new traffic surveillance systems, 
a beefed-up traffic management center and instrumented intersections, and 
improved motorist information systems that will benefit all Floridians.

Also, we never said "smart cars" were the only answer. But the alternatives -- 
building more roads, moving employees closer to their workplace or regulating 
the vehicle miles traveled -- aren't exactly met with open arms.

At General Motors, we're willing to invest some of our own money and 
engineering know-how to try smart car projects in hopes of improving the 
motoring experience for all.

LAIDLAW BUS DRIVER ARRIVES DRUNK FOR HIS SENTENCING; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: THE INCIDENT MAY COST HAROLD KEITH LONE A PLEA-BARGAIN AND NEARLY DOUBLE 
HIS POSSIBLE SENTENCE. 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles man who pleaded guilty to driving a school bus while drunk showed 
up for his sentencing Tuesday intoxicated, shouted obscenities in the hallway 
and interrupted court proceedings by muttering, "No way, Jose" as his lawyer 
sought to silence him. 
</P>
<P>
The incident could cost him a plea-bargain and almost double his possible 
sentence, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge James A. Coleman stopped the sentencing 
proceedings and ordered Harold Keith Lone handcuffed and taken to a jail cell 
for a blood-alcohol test. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Lone's blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.35% -- more 
than four times the 0.08% level at which a person is legally presumed to be 
intoxicated, Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Plafker said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman ordered Lone back to court today. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen someone show up drunk on the day of sentencing," said a 
stunned prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Mas. "It's a spit in the face of 
the system." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the district attorney's office said a drunk defendant could be 
considered incapable of understanding court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Mas said the incident threw into question a plea-bargain reached in March when 
Lone pleaded guilty to one count of driving under the influence of alcohol for 
being drunk when he arrived to pick up a busload of children at an Encino 
elementary school in January. 
</P>
<P>
Lone, 40, of Los Angeles, also pleaded guilty to one count of perjury for using 
an alias to obtain a driver's license to secure a job as a school bus driver 
with Laidlaw Transit Co. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Lone used the name Harold Keith Holmes to hide five 
drunk-driving convictions and a lengthy arrest record for crimes, including 
robbery, burglary and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Lone's guilty plea, prosecutors had agreed to drop an 
additional count of driving under the influence and driving with a suspended 
license and agreed to ask for a sentence of no more than two years and eight 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mas said the judge had earlier agreed to the plea-bargain and sentence but now 
might order Lone to stand trial on all four charges, which carry a possible 
sentence of four years and eight months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for the plea-bargain was that Lone pleaded guilty before trial 
and acknowledged responsibility for driving drunk, Mas said. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Lone showed up for court an hour late, dressed in shorts, a 
soiled white T-shirt and a blue jacket emblazoned with the word, "Laidlaw." He 
shouted profanities and made obscene gestures at newspaper photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, Lone interrupted Coleman as he discussed sentencing 
options. "No. No way. No way, Jose," Lone muttered, ignoring pleas to be quiet 
from his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Thom Tibor. 
</P>
<P>
After warning Lone several times to be quiet, Coleman said: "This man sounds as 
though he's under the influence" and ordered Lone jailed for tests, held 
overnight and returned to court today, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Mas said she does not believe that additional charges will be filed unless it 
is determined that Lone drove himself to court. A bailiff, who helped search 
Lone in the courthouse jail, said he found no car keys. Tibor said Lone was 
driven to court by a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 16, a motorist with a car phone called police after he saw Lone's 
otherwise empty school bus weaving across three lanes of the Hollywood Freeway 
at speeds of up to 70 m.p.h. The motorist followed the bus to Lanai Street 
Elementary School where Lone was to pick up 57 children. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Lone was staggering, his speech was slurred and he appeared 
confused. A breath test showed that he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27% -- 
more than three times the new legal limit of 0.08%, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Motor Vehicle records show that Lone has five drunk-driving 
convictions dating back to 1982. His driver's license has been suspended since 
1983, but he continued to drive despite repeated warnings not to do so, the 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
Lone was hired as a $7.75-per-hour school bus driver in September after he 
presented himself to Laidlaw as a self-employed handyman named Holmes with 
valid credentials and a clean driving record, Laidlaw officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw, a U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian corporation, is the largest school bus 
company in the world, operating about 20,000 school bus routes in 16 states. 
</P>
<P>
Another Laidlaw bus driver, Joseph Bolden, was arrested in San Diego on 
suspicion of driving drunk after his bus crashed into a pickup truck Feb. 2. 
Three people were injured, including a high school passenger who suffered a 
broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, Laidlaw bus driver Wesley Reed Jr. was arrested in 
South-Central Los Angeles and charged with misdemeanor counts of carrying a 
loaded, concealed pistol. He had one previous drunk-driving conviction and two 
accidents, the city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, another Laidlaw driver pleaded no contest in Glendale to having sex 
with a 15-year-old hearing-impaired passenger.

MAKES SHAMIR LOOK LIKE A MODERATE; 
</P>
<P>
* NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS NOT BUILT FOR COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's new government represents the most dramatic lurch to the right in the 
country's 42-year history. And that is not going to help the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's new government represents the most dramatic lurch to the right in the 
country's 42-year history. And this is not going to help the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Its narrow base -- it was approved by only 62 members of the 120-member Knesset 
-- leaves Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir dependent on two small parties best 
known for wanting to annex the West Bank, and on a third that would expel all 
Arabs living there. Further support comes from Orthodox religious elements 
expected to demand tougher dietary and Sabbath closing laws. 
</P>
<P>
In short, it is a government of rigidly fixed and obdurate views, of men who 
for the most part have little inclination to pursue the democratic political 
norms of compromise and conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
What do Israelis think of such a coalition? An opinion poll published last 
week, before Shamir finally forged his new alliance, found only 14% of voters 
favoring establishment of a regime based on far-right and religious parties. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, that is the kind of government Israel now has. Israelis 
uncomfortable with annexationist and expulsionist views may find consolation in 
the prospect that internal disputes could soon send the coalition flying apart. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir himself has been restrained in hailing the end of the 88 days of interim 
government that followed the Labor Alignment's decision to pull out of its 
coalition with his Likud party. His own preference clearly was to revive the 
troubled but tolerable marriage with Labor that had produced six years of power 
sharing. That would have assured continued paralysis in a number of areas, key 
among them decisions about dealing politically with the Palestinians. But it 
would also have spared Shamir the need to placate the extremists to whom he was 
forced to turn for support. It says much about the political cast of the new 
government that Shamir, by comparison, emerges as one of its more moderate 
members. 
</P>
<P>
In partial recognition of the trouble-making potential of his multiparty 
government, Shamir has set as its first priority the integration of the 250,000 
Soviet Jewish immigrants expected this year. It's a reasonable goal, first 
because Israel remains appallingly ill-prepared to house and employ the sudden 
wave of immigrants now flooding in, second because absorption is probably the 
one issue most Israelis can agree on for now. 
</P>
<P>
The drawback is that the man Shamir has put in charge of housing is Ariel 
Sharon, the former defense minister and architect of Israel's disastrous 1982 
invasion of Lebanon. It's no secret where Sharon would prefer to build 
accommodations for new citizens: on the West Bank. Such an effort could set up 
a renewed confrontation with the Bush Administration, which strongly opposes 
the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The shift to the far-right makes it all but inevitable that Israel will do even 
less than it has so far to pursue political talks with the Palestinians. David 
Levy, the new foreign minister, opposes Shamir's own 1989 plan for elections in 
the occupied territories. In any event, the attempted May 30 attack on Israeli 
civilian targets by an element of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and 
the PLO's typically self-wounding refusal specifically to condemn such 
terrorism, could force an effective suspension of the U.S. intermediary role. 
</P>
<P>
That won't disturb Israel's hard-line government. But there's plenty about the 
new government that can be expected to disturb the Israeli people, and distress 
Israel's friends.

NEW HOPE IN THE LAND OF THE INCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 500 years ago the Inca Empire stretched from the Amazon to the Andes, 
ruled by one chief, the Inca, from a stronghold in Peru. The Inca ruled 
because, with a sundial carved of stone, he was wise and powerful enough to 
control the waxing and waning of the seasons. After winter's scarce, thin 
sunlight, the Inca would call the sun, the Inti, to return and bless the 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
If only such a mystical device existed today. For Peru's new president-elect, 
Alberto Fujimori, may need a touch of shamanism to bring prosperity back to 
Peru. 
</P>
<P>
When Fujimori is inaugurated July 28, he will inherit an awesome list of 
problems: An inflation rate of more than 2,000%. Bitter racial and class 
differences that divide Peruvians of Indian and Hispanic descent. A war against 
a tough guerrilla army with an ideology of indiscriminate violence that so far 
claims 20,000 lives and shows no signs of abating. And fertile acres dedicated 
to the Andean region's only paying cash crop -- coca leaves, the source of 
America's cocaine plague. Compounding his financial problems, Fujimori will 
also have to renew ties with international bankers who cut off credit to 
outgoing President Alan Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori appeared on Peru's political scene 
just a few months ago. A dark horse with no political experience, he trounced 
conservative Mario Vargas Llosa, the world famous novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Exit polls indicate Fujimori's victory was due to his popularity among rural 
and lower-class Peruvians who found the traditional political structure unable 
to offer any promise that a way out of Peru's political morass can be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration plans to send $35 million in military aid and U.S. 
military advisers to Peru's most conflict-ridden region to train the military 
to fight both drug trafficking and the guerrillas, battles the Peruvians have 
in the past been loath to fight and which Fujimori says militarization has only 
worsened. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori's election sparked music and dancing among the descendants of the 
Incas. They are hoping that he will garner enough international support to 
break Peru's cycle of destitution and violence. They are clamoring for crop 
subsidies to diminish the attractions of growing coca. They are clamoring for 
employment and health care in the hope the guerrillas will fade away. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should work cooperatively with Fujimori, who wants input and 
help in formulating new economic policy. Washington should also support the 
necessary, if difficult, route of economic development. This is certainly as 
critical a juncture in Peruvian history as the rise and fall of the Inca: No 
talisman will be as effective as truly well-targeted international aid.

SECRETARY KEMP BEATS A SMART RETREAT; 
</P>
<P>
* PULLS BACK FAST ON COUNTERPRODUCTIVE HUD RULING ON IMMIGRATION FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp knew how to read a defense in 
his days as a football quarterback, and now he has made the right call on the 
bureaucratic playing field. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp scrambled deftly out of the pocket on Monday to escape the fierce 
political pressure generated by his department's insensitive response to Costa 
Mesa's immigration policy. He suspended an opinion rendered by his general 
counsel that had managed over the weekend to offend a vast cross section of 
immigration groups and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa had no idea it would stir such national outrage when its divided 
City Council last summer passed an ordinance requiring charities receiving 
funds to monitor the immigration status of recipients. The city fathers were so 
unsure of the fairness of their own decision that they actually rescinded the 
ordinance later on, all the while looking to Washington, the source of 
community development money, for clarification. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor had been the swing vote when the ordinance passed and again when it 
was pulled back. Then came a stunning decision from HUD's general counsel last 
week that a city could, in effect, turn nonprofit groups into unwilling 
deputies to enforce immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, immigration groups, already concerned about a recent report 
that found widespread discrimination by employers against immigrants, were very 
upset. And so the legal opinion presented political problems both for the mayor 
of Costa Mesa and for the secretary of HUD. The Bush Administration, after all, 
has been trying to cast charities as points of light, not grand inquisitors. 
Politically, it necessarily looks to immigrants for support as the old 
Republican Sunbelt strongholds shift in ethnic composition in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Jack Kemp. He saw correctly that even if his lawyer had issued a 
perfectly sound legal opinion, based on HUD's own regulations, it wasn't 
necessarily good policy. The legal ruling indeed had opened an amazing 
Pandora's box: Nonprofits were to be co-opted into doing the federal 
government's immigration screening, immigrants were to be subjected to new 
discrimination. Kemp was right to retreat from the ruling and to put things on 
hold until they can be sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
Two conclusions are inescapable. City councils shouldn't try to transform 
charities into arms of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. And 
Washington's opinions may follow the letter of the law and still be bad as real 
public policy.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIREFIGHTER HURT IN $500,000 HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that heavily damaged a large Woodland Hills house Tuesday morning caused 
an estimated $500,000 in damages and sent a firefighter to the hospital with 
exhaustion, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 4:22 a.m. in the two-story, 4,500-square-foot house in 
the 4400 block of Da Vinci Avenue, just south of Mulholland Drive, Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Sunny Olins said she and her family were able to escape with their 
pets -- two birds and a dog -- after discovering the fire. She said the family 
had lived in the house 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the fire started in the garage and then spread 
through the attic, Wells said. It took two dozen firefighters an hour to 
extinguish the flames. An unidentified firefighter, who was overcome by 
exhaustion while battling the blaze, was taken to Humana Hospital-West Hills 
for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not known and was under routine investigation, Wells 
said. The estimated loss included damage to the house, furniture and two cars.

PROPOSED AIRPORT NOISE LIMITS CRITICIZED ON BOTH FRONTS; 
</P>
<P>
VAN NUYS: THE ORDINANCES COULD BAR HALF OF THE JETS. AIRPORT OPERATORS SAY THE 
LIMITS WOULD HURT BUSINESS, BUT A HOMEOWNER ACTIVIST SAYS THEY DON'T GO FAR 
ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aircraft operators at Van Nuys Airport are organizing to fight two proposed 
ordinances to be considered tonight that would clamp down on the noisiest jets, 
but homeowner group leaders say the suggested regulations would bring little 
relief from jet roar. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ordinances to be considered by the Los Angeles Board of Airport 
Commissioners would ban takeoffs and landings of the noisiest jets over the 
next eight years. The other would immediately bar additional noisy jets from 
being based at the private aviation facility. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate ban would permit no additional jets that generate 77 or more 
decibels on takeoff to be based at the airport -- a standard that is not met by 
half of the 90 jets now based there. The ban "will be a severe hardship" on the 
charter and aircraft servicing businesses that operate at Van Nuys, said Rick 
Voorhis, president of the Van Nuys Airport Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"What about someone who has put a deposit on a plane that doesn't meet the 77 
d.b.a. rule?" he asked. "It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
And the gradual phasing out of the noisiest jets will "shrivel up much of the 
businesses at the airport," said Voorhis, who said his group represents more 
than 200 businesses and individual pilots operating at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
But the two proposed ordinances are "too little and way too late, considering 
how much noise this airport causes," said Gerald A. Silver, president of 
Homeowners of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
He has led efforts for a complete ban on planes that generate 74 decibels or 
more. "The airport people are just throwing us a bone." 
</P>
<P>
A study of airport records indicates that an outright ban on planes that 
generate 74 or more decibels would affect no propeller-driven planes and would 
bar "only about 25% of jet operations, and with that the neighborhood would 
grow much quieter," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport commissioners are to consider both proposed ordinances at a meeting at 
7 p.m. at the Airtel Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager Charles Zeman said he is expecting a "contentious meeting, 
based on what I've heard about the noise regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Airports staff has suggested that only the ban on basing more 
noisy jets at the airport be contained in an interim ordinance. It would go 
into effect immediately and last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the noise regulations, contained in a long-range ordinance, 
would be opened up for comment for six months, then brought up for final 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, starting next January, the maximum noise level 
would be set at 85 decibels -- a level that airport officials said would affect 
only a handful of older craft. 
</P>
<P>
Between next January and January, 1998, the maximum level would gradually be 
lowered to 77 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
That would force out about half of the 90 jets now based at the airport, 
according to airport officials. About 800 non-jets are also based at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the airport has only one noise regulation -- banning takeoffs by 
airplanes generating more than 74 decibels between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed long-range ordinance, that nighttime ban would be moved up 
to 10 p.m., but not until January, 1996.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $4-MILLION NORDHOFF BRIDGE, LINK OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $4-million connector road designed to ease congestion on Nordhoff Street in 
Northridge was opened to traffic Tuesday, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly half-mile long connector, which includes a bridge over Southern 
Pacific railroad tracks and Limekiln Creek, closes a gap in Nordhoff between 
Tampa and Corbin avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The city has wanted to link Nordhoff into a continuous thoroughfare since 1972, 
but the project was not funded until 1986, when the owners of the Northridge 
Fashion Center agreed to pay $1.5 million of the cost in return for city 
permission to expand the mall. 
</P>
<P>
City officials expect the extention to carry 35,000 vehicles a day.

COUNCIL IGNORES WARNING, OKS ZONING LAW ON BURBANK AIRPORT TAXIWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council was warned Tuesday that passing a zoning law to 
restrain Burbank Airport from extending a taxiway would be illegal, but the 
council ignored the warning. 
</P>
<P>
By a 13-0 vote, the council approved a zoning law that would require the 
airport to submit any construction plans to the city for an environmental 
review if the projects are to be built within Los Angeles city limits. 
</P>
<P>
The law is aimed at Burbank Airport's plans to build a 2,000-foot addition to 
its Taxiway B, situated on the west side of its north-south runway. It could 
set the stage for a showdown between the airport and the city, which have often 
clashed in recent years over airplane noise. 
</P>
<P>
The northern tip of the airport extends over the Burbank city line into Los 
Angeles. The taxiway extension is to be built on 53 acres situated entirely in 
Los Angeles, and the airport plans to begin grading next month. 
</P>
<P>
The measure to restrict the airport was introduced by Councilman Joel Wachs, 
who represents nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs has said the law may give the city leverage over airport expansion plans 
that have been in the works for years and are opposed by many Los Angeles 
homeowners. "It'll be effective if they need this property for their expansion 
project," Wachs said a week ago when the measure was first reviewed by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs was in Europe at a housing conference. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the council for the Burbank Airport's governing board was attorney 
Chris Funk, who said the new zoning law would be illegal because the U.S. 
Supreme Court has ruled that local zoning laws cannot supersede Federal 
Aviation Administration guidelines for airports. 
</P>
<P>
The city law would "thwart the objectives of the FAA" and be contrary to "good 
public purposes and safety," Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
Funk said the extension of Taxiway B is needed to enhance safety. Because the 
taxiway is too short, aircraft on the west side of the north-south runway must 
cross the runway -- at right angles to other traffic -- to reach Taxiway A on 
the opposite side in order to arrive at the northern end of the runway to take 
off.

BORDER PATROL MAKES FIRST OF I-5 SWEEPS FOR ILLEGALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal immigration authorities have begun what will be occasional closings of 
a three-mile stretch of Interstate 5 near the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort 
to sweep the freeway corridor for illegal aliens and to cut down on the number 
of undocumented pedestrians struck by vehicles, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The first shutdowns and sweeps occurred Friday and Saturday evenings, resulting 
in the quick arrests of 334 undocumented foreigners -- including 213 
apprehended Saturday, said Ted A. Swofford, a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers attest to the high volume of undocumented people who gather along 
the freeway each day, often waiting for rides to the north provided by area 
smugglers who wait near the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol will repeat the operation in coming months, Swofford said, 
but manpower limitations make it impossible to launch such sweeps every day, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it was a success; we were able to apprehend a lot of people and we 
were able to identify some of the smugglers," said Swofford, who explained that 
the weekend was targeted because it is traditionally a high-volume period for 
illicit border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Following the sweeps, Swofford acknowledged, undocumented people quickly 
returned to the freeway median and to areas along the highway where they have 
long congregated. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists driving along border-area roads are often startled to see groups of 
pedestrians -- including women and children, the young and the old -- 
negotiating the area's high-speed roadways, particularly I-5. The grid of 
highways that converge at the border form imposing and hazardous barriers for 
the hundreds of illicit crossers who enter the United States from Tijuana each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, vehicles on border-area highways in San Diego have struck and killed 
13 undocumented pedestrians, said a spokesman for the California Highway 
Patrol. There were 28 such deaths in 1988 and 24 in 1989. Many other people 
have been injured, often by hit-and-run drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, state highway officials have added lighting in the area, 
repaired fences, trimmed roadside brush that provides cover and installed 
flashing warning signals advising motorists to be alert for pedestrians. But 
the problems have continued. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol operation was launched Friday evening with assistance from 
the CHP and the San Diego Police Department. Highway officials closed the 
approximately three-mile stretch of I-5 -- from the off-ramps leading to I-805 
in the south to the junction of California 905 in the north. City police, 
meanwhile, directed traffic away from the affected entrance ramps. 
</P>
<P>
During the operation, traffic was diverted onto I-805, which parallels I-5 on 
its north-south route. California 905 was used as an east-west connector for 
the detour. The diversion lasted 18 minutes Saturday evening and 30 minutes 
Friday.

'OFFENSIVE' ITEMS EXCISED FROM STUDENT MAGAZINE; 
</P>
<P>
JOURNALISM: REDONDO UNION HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIALS RESTRICTED ENTRIES IN A 
LITERARY PUBLICATION THEY THOUGHT WERE OFFENSIVE. IRATE STUDENTS ARE CHARGING 
CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid charges of censorship, students at Redondo Union High School went to press 
last week with a student literary magazine in which more than a half dozen 
allegedly offensive artworks, poems and stories had been altered or excised at 
the behest of school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Powell, the 18-year-old editor of the student publication Opus, said the 
changes were forced on staffers after a teacher who was not involved with the 
magazine seized the galleys 2 1/2 weeks ago and complained to the principal 
that some submissions were sacrilegious and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items the teacher found objectionable, Powell said, were a poem by an 
honor student titled "(expletive) Authority" and a drawing of a demon 
swallowing a crucifix on which the face of Christ was a Happy Face logo. 
</P>
<P>
"The material that was presented to me was very obscene," said Principal Jack 
Clement, who added that he responded by convening a five-member committee of 
faculty and administration "to review the literary merit" of the publication. 
</P>
<P>
"As a school official, I feel I have a responsibility to make sure the image 
our school projects reflects our various audiences," he said. "Yes, there ought 
to be freedom of expression. I firmly believe in the 1st Amendment. But we 
serve several different audiences, not only in our school but in our community, 
and our charge is to bring out the best in our students in terms of their 
writing and talent." 
</P>
<P>
But students disagreed, as did the magazine's faculty adviser, David Lemire, 
who, like Clement, sat on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the things (Clement) wanted edited were so insignificant," said 
Lemire, an English teacher who has been volunteer adviser to the magazine for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire noted, too, that this is Clement's first year with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he just wanted to avoid any potential phone call from any potential 
parent of any potential frame of mind," Lemire said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire said that even though the author of the poem had already agreed to 
change its title and the magazine staff volunteered to excise the sketch, 
Clement alerted the committee to dozens of submissions that he felt should be 
censored, ranging from a sketch of a serpent entwined around a crucifix to the 
use of such words as rape. Most of Clement's suggestions -- including those two 
examples -- were overruled by the committee, Lemire and Clement agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But, Lemire added, the principal exercised veto power over the committee in 
some cases, insisting that all profanity involving the word god be removed from 
the students' short stories and poems. 
</P>
<P>
Clement denied that he had used veto power over the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an open, collaborative effort, and . . . we walked away feeling that we 
had enhanced the quality of the product," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire said he and Powell plan to take the matter before the South Bay Union 
High School District trustees at their next meeting. Moreover, he said, he has 
consulted the American Civil Liberties Union about his concerns, along with the 
Washington-based People for the American Way, a national First Amendment rights 
watchdog organization. Ironically, People for the American Way recently lauded 
Redondo Beach's elementary trustees for withstanding efforts by a local 
Christian parents' group to censor the grade-school reading curricula. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Walter Hale defended Clement's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"What is commonly misunderstood by youngsters is that they have rights, but 
they also have responsibilities to maintain professional standards of language 
and journalism, and from what I understand, those standards were not upheld," 
Hale said. "The school has some rights, too, about what it's going to publish." 
</P>
<P>
Students, meanwhile, remained incensed about the controversy, which has spawned 
a line of anti-censorship buttons and reams of flyers protesting Clement's 
actions.

FREE DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR ASIANS GOES INTO SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A free telephone directory assistance for Asians began full-scale operation 
Tuesday in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Asian-owned companies, the service -- called the 777-CLUB -- is 
expected to attract 2,000 calls each month, said Marty Shih, president of the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Callers seeking business, community group or government services numbers can 
receive information in Chinese -- Cantonese and Mandarin, and, by the end of 
the year, Korean and Japanese should be added, Shih said. Residential numbers 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
Callers also can get more than just phone numbers. "If people with a language 
barrier or translation problem have an emergency, they can call us and we'll do 
the translating," said Shih, who gave the example of someone being robbed. 
</P>
<P>
The service was developed by Los Angeles-based Asian Business Connection, a 
long-distance carrier that also offers a credit card network, travel services 
and a telephone network shopping service. Its partners in the 411-type service 
include the Chinese Daily News, which is doing the marketing, and the Chinese 
Yellow Pages, which will provide updated directory information for 10 years, 
Shih said. 
</P>
<P>
The service has been tested since April, and so far response has been strong, 
attracting 400 calls a day, Shih said. The service, which is available 
nationwide by calling 1-800-777-CLUB, is expected to draw about 2,000 calls per 
day now that it is in full service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the added calls, Shih estimated the cost of operating the directory line 
at $42,000 each month. That will be paid by Asian Business Connection as an 
advertising expense, he said. "It's a win-win situation," Shih said. 
"Hopefully, people will use the . . . line, then think about us when they order 
airline tickets." 
</P>
<P>
While callers from anywhere can use the service, the data base lists numbers 
from Los Angeles to San Francisco, as well as Houston, Dallas, Chicago, New 
York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"We can manually check numbers in other cities," Shih said. "But people will 
have to be patient -- we don't have everything yet, so we don't guarantee."

Egypt, in the World Cup tournament for the first time since 1934, continued a 
tournament trend of upsets when Magdi Abdelghani converted a penalty shot with 
eight minutes remaining to tie the European champion Netherlands, 1-1, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The draw was a good result, we played very well," Eygptian Coach Mahmoud 
el-Gohary said. "I had hoped that we would win for our country." 
</P>
<P>
If not for the work of Dutch goalie Hans van Breukelen, Egypt might have won. 
He made two brilliant saves, with a dive on Ahmed el Kass' left-footed drive 
and with both hands on a spectacular header by Abdelghani late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands struggled for almost an hour against Egypt's conservative 
style. Then substitute Wim Kieft scored on a crossing feed from Dutch star 
Marco van Basten at 58 minutes, to put the Dutch ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
But Netherlands' slow defense faltered in the 82nd minute when Eygptian striker 
Hossam Hassan, using his considerable speed, broke through. The Netherlands' 
Ronald Koeman pulled him down in the penalty area, setting up Andel-Ghani's 
penalty shot. 
</P>
<P>
Andelghani beat van Breukelen low to the left corner to tie the game and give 
Egypt its first World Cup goal in 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If, with the talent we have, we cannot win a match like this, then it is a 
debacle," Kieft said. "Now we have to win the next two games. Such a team can 
only play well when we play badly." 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, looking lethargic in the muggy weather, suddenly came to life in the 
58th minute when van Basten made a powerful run on the left wing. He sent in a 
low cross that Frank Rijkaard missed. But Kieft was right there to flick the 
ball past goalie Ahmed Shoubeir. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt kept fighting back, led by Hassan, who had several chances to score. 
</P>
<P>
The much-heralded Dutch trio of van Basten, Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit were 
outplayed by such unknown players as Hassan, el-Kas and Gamal Abdel-Hamid as 
the trend of surprises in the first round continued. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing badly for two years," Gullit said. "We don't have enough 
confidence. It's hard to concentrate after winning (the European title)."

Belgium frustrated South Korea's attack and pulled away to a 2-0 victory on 
second-half goals by Marc Degryse and Michel De Wolf in the opening World Cup 
match for both teams Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Degryse put Belgium ahead, 1-0, in the 53rd minute when he floated an 85-foot 
shot over goalie Choi In-Yong, after the South Korean ventured too far from the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
In the 64th minute, De Wolf intercepted a pass in the South Korean end of the 
field, then maneuvered into position and scored from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many surprises in the World Cup. Some small teams have 
beaten giants. We had to win this match," Belgian defender Eric Gerets said. 
"We weren't afraid, but we had a lot of respect for the South Korean team." 
</P>
<P>
More than 32,000 fans saw Belgium take an early lead over Group E rivals 
Uruguay and Spain, both considered as strong as the top-seeded Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
"Belgium has its first two points in its pocket, that is the most important," 
Coach Guy Thys said. "But I would have loved to see a couple of more goals."

<P>
LAW GOES BEYOND BAN ON HUNTING MOUNTAIN LIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS and PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 117, the Wildlife Protection Act, doesn't merely ban the hunting of 
mountain lions in California. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mansfield, the Department of Fish and Game's assistant division chief for 
wildlife management, and DeWayne Johnston, chief of enforcement, say that the 
law -- which went into effect upon approval June 5 -- also prohibits 
Californians from hunting lions in any of the other 10 Western states where it 
is legal and bringing their trophies back into the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It would prohibit possession, unless you can prove the lion was in your 
possession before June 6 of 1990," Mansfield said. "It would prevent you as a 
hunter from going to Montana, killing a lion legally, and then bringing the 
pelt, the carcass, whatever back into California. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, (the proponents') intent was not only to stop lion hunting in 
California but to stop California residents from hunting lions in any other 
state." 
</P>
<P>
The state's houndsmen -- hunters who use dogs to pursue game such as bears and 
lions -- probably have seen the last of pursuit permits -- usually 85 to 120 a 
year -- that allowed hunters to chase game with dogs, tree it but not kill it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, a tight reading by the enforcement guys is that it would eliminate 
the opportunity to use pursuit permits," Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after proposed lion seasons were thrown out by courts in 1987 and 
'88, the Fish and Game Commission also lost its bear season, and the pursuit 
permits increased to 447. For those houndsmen, apparently, the sport was not 
the kill but the chase, although proponents of Proposition 117 were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my doubts that that's in fact what they do," said Gerald Meral, the 
Sacramento lobbyist whose Planning and Conservation League sponsored the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mansfield: "We're taking steps to amend Section 265 (of the state's Fish 
and Game Code) to conform with the initiative and delete the option for pursuit 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
"The interesting thing is, you've never been able to sell a mountain lion or 
parts of mountain lions -- such as pelts -- in California. This initiative now 
allows you to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a poorly worded section. The intent was (something else). But in essence, 
it would allow lions and their parts to be sold if you could prove you had 
(them) before June 6 of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Summer is still a week away, but don't tell anyone fishing off Santa Catalina 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer has kicked in, and the water's warmed up," said Ray Province of L.A. 
Harbor Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Province said boats from the landing -- after an on-again-off-again spring -- 
have been doing well at the island all weekend, but the action really picked up 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun, with 39 passengers, had 14 yellowtail weighing up to 32 pounds, and 
seven white sea bass to 38 pounds. The haul also included 410 barracuda and 250 
calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Top Gun had only seven anglers, who caught 25 yellowtail averaging 21 
pounds, one white sea bass, 70 barracuda and 40 calico bass. Two of the white 
sea bass taken Sunday aboard the Top Gun weighed more than 40 pounds. The Outer 
Limits on Monday had 20 catch 15 yellowtail, five white sea bass, 102 barracuda 
and 87 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best fishing in many, many years," said Bobby Taft, skipper of the 
Top Gun. "If you can (catch) squid (for bait) at Catalina, it's a guarantee 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Black Jack, out of Redondo Sportfishing, reported early Tuesday that its 
passengers had already boated 30 yellowtail, 22 white sea bass and 150 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sportfishers out of San Diego are beginning to catch more and larger 
yellowtail in California waters only 16 to 20 miles west of Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 21 passengers aboard Buzz Brizendine's Prowler caught 61 yellowtail 
averaging close to 12 pounds. The Pacific Queen, fishing the same area, 
reported 22 yellowtail for 12 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
In previous weeks, most of the yellowtail had been taken 40 to 60 miles 
southwest of San Diego and had averaged between six and eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Boris apparently did not adversely affect the fishing off southern 
Baja California. Blue marlin and wahoo have moved into the area, and striped 
marlin remain extremely active only eight to 10 miles off the arched rock 
signifying land's end. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had several blues in the 250- to 280-pound range, two over 500 and the 
638-pounder," said Darrell Primrose of Tortuga Sportfishing. The 638-pounder 
was caught Monday by Dale Poynter of Delano. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Boris served to pump warm water into the area. Water temperatures 
are averaging between 80 and 82 degrees, Primrose said. 
</P>
<P>
In the East Cape region, fishing remains excellent. Dan Perry and 12 friends 
from Las Vegas spent two days' fishing from the fleet at Hotel Palmas De 
Cortez. Their catch: seven blue marlin, 28 sailfish, 14 dorado, 10 yellowfin 
tuna and one wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Tag applications and regulation booklets for deer, bighorn sheep, elk and 
antelope are available at sporting goods stores and Department of Fish and Game 
offices in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants for X Zone and special deer, antelope, bighorn sheep and elk hunts 
must file by June 25 to be eligible for the computerized, random selection of 
assignments. Deer tags for A, B, D and Archery Only zones are available at 
authorized outlets. 
</P>

The San Diego Marlin Club's annual Just for the Halibut tournament, proceeds of 
which will benefit the Wheelchair Regatta sponsored by the Silvergate Yacht 
Club, will be held Saturday from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. Prizes will be awarded for 
the largest halibut, and anglers can fish from Oceanside to Point Descanso. The 
cost is $20 for adults, $7.50 for those 16 or younger. Information: (619)

FISHING REPORT: LEFTOVERS BIG ENOUGH AT BIG BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It rained through the weekend in the Big Bear Lake area, and while the storm 
kept the crowds down, it didn't seem to affect the fishing.

DIGEST: MOORPARK HIGH TO PLAY CANADIAN SCHOOL IN FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark High has scheduled a football game for Sept. 14 against a team from 
Canada, giving the area two such matchups that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark will play host to Okotoks High from Alberta, one night before Village 
Christian meets St. Mary's of Calgary at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark originally was scheduled to play Village Christian that weekend, but 
Coach Mike Plaisance arranged the St. Mary's game and asked Moorpark to release 
his school from its contract. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Coach Rob Dearborn agreed on the condition that Moorpark find a 
replacement. When Dearborn failed in that endeavor, Plaisance arranged for the 
second Canadian team to head south. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-handers Robert Ramirez and Jakob Jensen of Highland Hall have been 
selected to the All-Southern Section Small Schools Division first team by a 
panel of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez (12-3, 1.83 earned-run average, .579 batting average) was selected for 
the second consecutive season. Jensen batted .518 and was 9-1 with an ERA of 
2.85.

<P>
TRIALS FOR DASH FOR CASH SET TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD McKINZIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trials for the Grade I Dash for Cash Derby will be held tonight at Los 
Alamitos with Newmont, the Los Alamitos Derby winner, and Ourautograph, the 
Laddie Handicap winner, heading the list of 18 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 fastest qualifiers in tonight's two trials will earn a spot in the final 
of the Dash for Cash Derby on June 24. That racing date will be the first 
Sunday afternoon program for Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Leonard Stein of Two Rock Ranch paid the $8,300 late fee to make Newmont 
eligible for the Dash for Cash Derby trials. Trained by Tom Bazley, Newmont 
scored a stunning upset in the Los Alamitos Derby on May 12, which was enough 
to prompt Stein and Bazley to take a shot at the Dash for Cash. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave some thought to going to the Rainbow Derby (at Ruidoso Downs in New 
Mexico) with him, but we wound up staying closer to home," Bazley said. 
</P>
<P>
Newmont will be facing a tougher test in the Dash for Cash Derby. Several top 
3-year-olds who passed on the Los Alamitos Derby will be coming out for this 
race, among them Ourautograph and Mighty Easy Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Bob Baffert, Ourautograph won last year's Kindergarten at Los 
Alamitos and recently won the Laddie Handicap in impressive fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Like Newmont, Ourautograph almost passed on the Dash for Cash Derby in favor of 
the Rainbow Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought about it, but it cost $20,000 to pay in late to the Rainbow and 
that slowed us down," Baffert said. "(Ourautograph is) doing great right now 
and I think he'll win this derby." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing right next to Ourautograph in the second of the two Dash for Cash Derby 
trials is Mighty Easy Pass, last year's Dash for Cash Futurity winner. 
</P>
<P>
A daughter of Easy Jet, Mighty Easy Pass will be trying to become the fourth 
horse in the 10-year history of the Dash for Cash Derby to win sweep both the 
futurity and the derby. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Ourautograph seems to be at the top of his game, Mighty Easy Pass may 
be a race away from her best effort. 
</P>
<P>
After her tough 1989 freshman campaign, Mighty Easy Pass was sent home to Utah, 
where bone chips were removed from her knee. In her first race after that 
surgery, the filly won a trial for the Kansas Derby at Ruidoso Downs but failed 
to go fast enough to qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
"She's only been here since June 7 so we're cutting it pretty close for the 
trials," said Carlos Lopez, who trains Mighty Easy Pass in California. "I'm 
just hoping she qualifies. If she does, we have 10 days before the final to get 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
The Dash for Cash Derby trials will be the eighth and ninth races on tonight's 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Lasix, which seemed to be the dominant story of this 
year's Belmont Stakes, has pretty much avoided Los Alamitos, but it seems that 
the use of the diuretic used to combat stress-induced bleeding from the lungs 
in thoroughbreds, is on the rise in quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
In last Saturday night's $148,000 Vessels Maturity, seven of the 10 entrants 
were listed as having been treated with Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
Although 70% of a quarter horse field may seem startling, veterinarian Nancy 
Goodman said the quality of the field may account for the high percentage of 
Lasix users. 
</P>
<P>
"The better horses run faster and they run harder," she said. "The harder and 
faster a horse runs, the more stress they put on their system and the more 
likely they are to bleed. 
</P>
<P>
"I also feel that you see more bleeders among the older horses, which is why 
the Maturity (a race for 4-year-olds) may have had seven horses running on 
Lasix." 
</P>
<P>
In the $233,000 Kindergarten, for instance, a race for 2-year-olds held June 2 
at Los Alamitos, only three of the 10 entrants raced on Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
One horse in Saturday night's Vessels Maturity racing without Lasix was the 
surprise winner, Jazzing Hi. 
</P>
<P>
Sent off at 9-1, Jazzing Hi set a stakes record with his 21.41-second 
quarter-mile victory. 
</P>
<P>
The victory in the Maturity was the first in a stakes for Jazzing Hi, although 
students of bloodlines, both human and horse, should not have been surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Jazzing Hi is trained by Daryn Charlton, the nephew of former quarter horse 
trainer Wayne Charlton, who won the first Vessels Maturity in 1972 with the 
champion mare Charger Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having good human bloodlines on his side, Jazzing Hi is a son of the 
top stakes mare Anna Hi, for several years the holder of the Los Alamitos 
870-yard track record. 
</P>
<P>
With his victory in the Vessels Maturity, Jazzing Hi earned an invitation to 
the $250,000 Champion of Champions to be run next winter at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Bob Gilbert unleashed a promising young runner in the 2-year-old 
Copauino, who scored her first victory in Saturday night's seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
A striking, gray daughter of Beduino, Copauino turned in an overpowering 
display in her second start as she won by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Jimmy and Elaine Coffman of Texas, Copauino is a half-sister to the 
stakes winner Packin Sixes and she may make her next start far away from Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know for sure, but I just may wait for the All American Futurity 
trials (in New Mexico) before I start this filly again," Gilbert said. "She 
acts like a real nice filly and I wouldn't want to hurt her before we get a 
chance at the big money." 
</P>
<P>
The $2.5-million All American Futurity is the richest event in quarter horse 
racing, with the final set for Labor Day.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PINIELLA ISN'T PANICKING, BUT REDS LOSE 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella says there is nothing to worry about, but the Cincinnati 
Reds are no longer looking like an outstanding team. 
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the Reds had a 31-12 record. They were leading the National League 
West by nine games. They had everything going for them. They combined hitting, 
pitching and defense. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last 10 days the Reds have not played well. They were at their 
worst Tuesday night at Cincinnati, losing a doubleheader to the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Greg Olson hit a grand slam and Tommy Glavine (3-4) went the 
distance and the Braves won, 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Gant, who had two doubles in the opener, had a triple and a home run in the 
nightcap as rookie Tommy Greene, recalled from from the minors, won, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
In their last 11 games, the Reds are 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who was with triple-A Richmond until Sunday, gave up three hits before 
being replaced in the sixth inning with none out. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine, one of the league's top left-handers, has had a circulation problem 
that has caused his left hand to become numb. Between innings he kept the hand 
in hot wraps. 
</P>
<P>
It must have helped because he went the distance for the first time in 12 
starts. He gave up seven hits and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Ken Griffey hit his first home run of the season, but it 
came after the Braves took a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the team to forget the road trip and go get the Braves," Piniella said. 
"Maybe they didn't hear me. On the trip, we didn't score runs. And we fail to 
hold the lead in close games. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's anything to get excited about. We're too good to go sour 
for any length of time. The poor trip doesn't bother me, because, after all, we 
won 17 of our first 21 away from home." 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing twice, the Reds, with nearest pursuer San Diego losing, still 
lead the West by five games. But the Braves cut the margin between first and 
last to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
New York 19, Chicago 8 -- There was a 25-m.p.h. wind blowing out at Wrigley 
Field, but only the Mets took advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets hit four home runs, two of them by Kevin McReynolds, and the Cubs 
didn't hit any. 
</P>
<P>
With his team scoring four runs in each of the first two innings, Dwight Gooden 
(4-5) didn't need to pitch well. He didn't. He lasted seven innings, giving up 
a career-high 11 hits and six runs, perhaps his worst performance of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In his four victories, Gooden's teammates have scored 44 runs. 
</P>
<P>
The team with the worst batting average in the league hammered the Cubs for 21 
hits, 12 of them for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Magadan, who had driven in only six runs in 75 at-bats, had four hits, 
including a home run, and drove in six runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been scrambling for playing time," Magadan said. "It's been a frustrating 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Tom O'Malley, who didn't get into the game until the fourth inning, had three 
doubles for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 7, San Diego 2 -- Rookie Rick Parker and veteran Gary Carter hit 
home runs for the Giants at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Although they lost another pitcher when Don Robinson had to leave the game 
because of a leg injury, the Giants won for the 10th time in their past 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, 14 games behind the Reds on June 1, are now only 7 1/2 games out of 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Thurmond took over for Robinson (2-0) after six innings and gave up the 
final San Diego run in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 7, Montreal 2 -- Ken Howell is merely carrying on tradition. For 
many years former Dodger pitchers have pitched with success throughout 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who couldn't make it as a relief pitcher for the Dodgers, has become 
the ace of the Phillies' staff. 
</P>
<P>
Howell won his sixth in a row and improved to 8-3 with a strong eight innings 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Dave Hollins, benefiting from early batting practice, hit a three-run 
home run in the second inning and Howell made sure the Phillies ended their 
five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal Manager Bob Rodgers was impressed by Howell. 
</P>
<P>
"He got stronger as the game went on," he said. "I though we'd get him, but he 
got us." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, St. Louis 3 -- Despite his fine record, left-hander Neal Heaton 
had been having trouble lately. He had not won since May 27. 
</P>
<P>
But Heaton (9-1) ran his record to 5-0 lifetime against the Cardinals in this 
game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton went seven innings, giving up all three runs and seven hits, but joining 
Frank Viola of New York as the only nine-game winners in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla had two doubles and a single and first baseman Sid Bream was four 
for four. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who have lost five of their last six games, got a two-run home 
run by Todd Zeile. 
</P>
<P>
The victory increased the Pirates' lead in the East to 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, in last place in the East, fell 11 1/2 games behind. DAN HAFNER

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: BREAST CANCER STUDY

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My college roommate recently went to her doctor for an examination, 
and he found a small mass in her breast. I don't know if the doctor was just 
trying to make my roommate feel better, but he was very reassuring about the 
future and said he was not even going to refer her for a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
I realize you can't give an educated opinion about a specific, hypothetical 
situation, but don't you think that the doctor is treating the entire situation 
a little too lightly? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: As you say, I have absolutely no way of evaluating the physician's 
approach to the problem you present. Since you are college students, I assume 
you and your roommate are in the 18 to 22 age range, and breast cancer is rare 
in women under age 30. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, researchers from Emery University School of Medicine in Atlanta 
reviewed a number of breast biopsy records. No cancer was found in the 178 
patients who were under 20 years of age, and only two cancers were found in the 
150 patients who were 21 to 25 years old. This low incidence of cancer in young 
women may account for the conservative approach being taken by your roommate's 
physician.

LETTERS TO FREYA, 1939-45 by Helmuth James von Moltke Edited and translated by 
Beate Ruhm von Oppen Alfred A. Knopf $24.95, 414 pages 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 21, 1941, a young German officer in the Abwehr military intelligence 
service sat down to a write a letter to his wife. He described some of the 
atrocities of the recent fighting -- villages burned to the ground, thousands 
of men and women murdered in reprisal executions, the Jewish citizens of Berlin 
rounded up, beaten in the streets, then deported to an unknown destination and 
an ominous fate. 
</P>
<P>
"And all this is child's play compared with what is happening in Poland and 
Russia," the young man wrote. "May I know this and yet sit at my table in my 
heated flat and have tea? Don't I thereby become guilty too? What shall I say 
when I am asked: And what did you do during that time?" 
</P>
<P>
The question is answered in "Letters to Freya," a remarkable collection of the 
wartime letters that Helmuth James von Moltke wrote to his young wife, Freya. 
The book is a unique historical document, a morality tale, a love story, all 
set within the very heart of the Third Reich and, in a real sense, in the soul 
of a man of conscience. 
</P>
<P>
The letters collected here show Moltke to have been a civilized and courageous 
figure set among barbarians and cowards, a strict moralist in a world where 
evil had become something casual and commonplace. A member of the Prussian 
gentry, a descendant of Bismarck's famous field marshal, a student of law and 
history, Moltke used his position as a legal adviser in the Abwehr to voice a 
principled opposition to the excesses of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Moltke organized the so-called Kreisauer Circle, a kind of underground whose 
members contemplated the rebuilding of Germany after what they regarded as its 
inevitable defeat. Ultimately, Moltke was arrested, condemned on charges of 
treason and put to death, but his letters continued until the very end as a 
stirring and enduring moral testament. According to George Kennan, he was "one 
of the few genuine Christian-Protestant martyrs of our time." 
</P>
<P>
"Letters to Freya," selected from more than 1,600 letters that Freya von Moltke 
hid from the Gestapo in the beehives on the Moltke estate, shows us the real 
man in all of his aspects. Moltke's letters report on what he ate for lunch, 
his lumbago, his suggestions on where the lilacs should be planted on his 
estate, the number of grains on a stalk of wheat that Freya sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Moltke's firsthand observations of the Third Reich that make "Letters 
of Freya" so fascinating and so important. He gave Freya a day-by-day account 
of the war, with eyewitness descriptions of Dunkirk, the Maginot Line, Paris 
under Nazi occupation, Berlin under an Allied air raid. "An uncanny sight to 
see," he wrote of the Fellini-esque scene of children at play among the festive 
ruins of a bombed-out shop that sold carnival decorations. "An apocalyptic 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
Moltke was too honest and too perceptive to close his eyes to the monstrous 
crimes that were committed behind the tattered veil of legality that he tried 
so hard to preserve. He made himself a firsthand witness to the Holocaust and 
the other crimes against humanity. As early as October, 1942, Moltke wrote to 
Freya that he heard "an authentic report on the 'SS furnace' (probably at 
Treblinka)" from an acquaintance who witnessed the ghastly scene. Moltke wrote: 
"So far I had not believed it, but he assured me that it was true: 6,000 people 
a day are 'processed' in this furnace." 
</P>
<P>
There's a certain preciousness that comes across in Moltke's letters. He 
complained, for example, that he was so distracted by the war news that he 
"wasn't even able to listen properly to the 'Eroica.' " And Moltke was clearly 
a man of ideas and ideals, not a man of action -- he declined to participate in 
the Stauffenberg plot against Hitler, although he was ultimately swept up by 
the Gestapo in the aftermath of the failed assassination. 
</P>
<P>
As I marveled over the moral spectacle of one man at war with the Third Reich, 
I kept reminding myself that more men and women like Moltke would not have 
stopped Hitler and the Nazis once they came to power. But I was tantalized -- 
and, at the same time, heartbroken -- by the thought that more men and women 
like Moltke might have stopped the Nazis from coming to power in the first 
place.

SHARING JOYS OF PARENTHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA CITY COLLEGE COURSE LETS PARENTS ENJOY KIDS BEING KIDS WITHOUT FLASH 
CARDS, COMPUTERS OR OTHER SUPER-BABY TOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, Klein is a regular contributor to San Gabriel Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two dozen women dressed in shorts and T-shirts sat on the floor of a sunny 
classroom, clutching wiggly 2-year-olds and singing "The Itsy Bitsy Spider" and 
"I'm a Little Teapot." 
</P>
<P>
As the melodies grew, the grinning children's personalities began to shine like 
the morning sun filtering through the windows. Some cautiously watched the 
group from their mothers' laps. Others enthusiastically belted out the lyrics 
and pantomimed along with the nursery rhymes. One red-haired girl -- freed from 
mommy's grasp -- ran up to the front of the room to lead the rest of the class. 
</P>
<P>
Watching kids being kids is the joy of parenthood, according to the philosophy 
fueling the morning's activity at Pasadena City College's Parent Education 
Class. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there is tremendous value in play and in children learning through 
discovery and hands-on experiences," said Mayris Wells, coordinator of the 
parent education classes offered free through the college's continuing 
education office. 
</P>
<P>
Sit in on a session of the course and you will not find super-babies or flash 
cards, nor will you hear computer keyboards clicking. But you will find swings 
and sandboxes and hear silly songs about popcorn popping and monkeys jumping on 
the bed. 
</P>
<P>
"Academic learning is not the goal of this program. We're creating space for 
the child to learn on his own," said Judy McCord, a 15-year veteran teacher of 
the program, who says the classes are as much for parents as they are for 
children. The children and their parents -- or full-time baby-sitters -- attend 
the courses offered at 10 San Gabriel Valley sites. 
</P>
<P>
"When you send your child away to preschool or you drop them off at a 
baby-sitter, you miss a lot of the joy that goes with parenting," McCord said. 
"We happen to believe that parenting is a relationship, not a role. To have a 
relationship you have to be connected, to have shared experiences and time." 
</P>
<P>
The no-credit parent education classes are funded entirely by the state and are 
organized for specific age groups of children, from newborns to 
pre-kindergarten. Each three-hour session includes time for free play, singing 
and motor development, and an hourlong discussion for the parents on a variety 
of topics related to the family. 
</P>
<P>
The course reflects the philosophy of Gertrude Laws, a Columbia University 
graduate with ideas about early childhood that were considered outlandish in 
the 1930s. Laws and another woman, Pauline Gartzman, started the parent 
education classes at Pasadena City College in 1933, said Ann Reynolds, the 
college's assistant dean of continuing education. 
</P>
<P>
Most adults at that time saw childhood as an annoying stage that should be 
grown out of as soon as possible, and they were taught to treat children as 
miniature adults, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Laws, on the other hand, believed that there was value in childhood and 
believed that parents ought to learn about children's behavior from their own 
offspring, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Laws' theories, which now coincide with those of many early-childhood experts, 
endured and so did the classes she founded. Like many other things in Pasadena, 
they became a tradition, passed on from generation to generation for nearly 60 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the teachers in the program today took the class as a child in 1938. And 
Pat Edmunds, a 65-year-old Pasadena grandmother who attends a class with her 
2-year-old granddaughter, also attended 38 years ago with her daughter, Caryn. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the classes have changed over the years. Fathers now attend regularly, 
McCord said, a phenomenon she never witnessed until a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said a new class that was started this year for Japanese-speaking parents 
was so successful that it will be repeated next year. Two bilingual 
Spanish-English classes are also offered, and Wells said she would like to see 
more bilingual classes for Armenian, Korean and other parents who aren't native 
English speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the classes, held on weekday mornings, attract mostly parents who are 
homemakers or work part time, Wells said she hopes to be able to include more 
full-time working parents by offering night classes in the fall that focus more 
on parenting skills and deal with all age groups, up to adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
A large focus of the classes is on establishing support groups for the parents, 
who say they form lasting friendships there. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-year-olds' class on a recent Wednesday morning, parents were sharing 
advice about preschool, potty training, temper tantrums and social interaction. 
</P>
<P>
In the newborn classes, McCord said, the parents discuss colic, sleep 
deprivation and the impact a baby has on its family. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the fact that you get out of the house, share what you're going through, 
listen to other people, is helpful," said Karen Tanner of Arcadia, whose son, 
Miles, spends much of the playtime on the swings. "It's good to see all these 
other kids, doing the same thing your kid is doing that's driving you crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"Parenthood can be really task-oriented and a lot of it can be drudgery. This 
makes it a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
The morning's discussion focused on how to keep marriage interesting despite 
the sometimes-numbing stress of having young children. 
</P>
<P>
McCord gave out advice gleaned from her own experience of rearing five 
children. "There's one thing to do," McCord said. "Turn off the TV." 
</P>
<P>
One mother looked at her in mock horror. "What do you do -- talk?" 
</P>
<P>
Another woman chimed in to recommend a plan used by her neighbors who couldn't 
afford a vacation. They parked their three children with a friend for the 
weekend and spent the time in their own back yard, lounging around the pool, 
barbecuing and drinking pineapple drinks with umbrellas stuck in them. 
</P>
<P>
Creative ideas like that motivate McCord to continue teaching the classes after 
15 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After working with the victims of child abuse and with troubled families in her 
private marriage-and-family counseling practice, McCord said, she likes to 
remind herself that there are caring, healthy families. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real personally enriching for me to see how much these parents are 
willing to invest in their kids. These children are going to be people of 
value. What they'll have is a real good sense of self. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they have to do, they'll be equal to it because these parents are 
educating their children simply by being with them." 
</P>
<P>

FINAL CHAPTER IN A 42-YEAR LOVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rio Hondo Elementary School lets out for summer break June 21, 
kindergarten teacher Doris Ann Walters will not only say goodby to her 
students, she will also bid farewell to the classroom in which she has taught 
for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 colleagues and former students will honor Walters today at a 
retirement party at the school on East Wildflower Road in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Walters has been a teacher with the El Monte City School District for 42 years, 
teaching first at Cherrylee Elementary School in El Monte. Then, when the 
district built Rio Hondo in an unincorporated area of Arcadia in 1952, she 
asked for a transfer to the new school, located around the corner from her 
home. "I walked to school for six years," said Walters, who has since moved to 
another part of Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a teacher who loved doing what I did," she said, adding that she 
never thought of teaching higher grades because her kindergartners "were 
curious about everything, and so willing to please." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a delightful age to be with. I'm going to miss them."

A Little Help From His Friends: Paul McCartney plans to perform a tribute to 
John Lennon when he appears in Liverpool on June 28 at the King's Dock Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The former Beatle has been rehearsing "Imagine" and "Strawberry Fields Forever" 
during what representatives are calling a "specially created" new show that 
will be more "Beatle-y." McCartney has also asked the audience to show up in 
1960s gear such as bell-bottoms and headbands. The tribute is in part a 
response to the recent heavily criticized Lennon tribute held in London where 
several artists performed Lennon songs. BETH KLEID

From Breathless to Blondie: Based on the runaway success of "Batman" and the 
anticipated success of "Dick Tracy," Walt Disney Pictures is preparing a 
feature musical film based on the comic strip "Blondie." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Uhry, who won an Oscar for the screenplay adaptation of "Driving Miss 
Daisy," will do the screenplay. The film is tentatively scheduled to start 
production next spring for a 1992 summer release. Disney is in active 
discussions with Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who won Oscars for their work 
on "The Little Mermaid," to write the score. Dean Young, who writes the 
nationally syndicated comic strip seen in some 2,000 newspapers, is set to be 
executive producer. BETH KLEID

MORNING REPORT: CBS' '48 HOURS' IS A TOP 10 SURPRISE

With reruns dominating the network schedules last week, there were also reruns 
on the Nielsen winners' list that came out Tuesday. "Roseanne," the top-rated 
show of the past season, was the most-watched show of the week, and NBC 
captured the network sweepstakes, as it did during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Both drew smaller ratings than usual, however. The big surprise in the Top 10 
was the CBS news program "48 Hours," which finished 10th among the week's 85 
prime-time programs. This was for a special Wednesday-night broadcast that 
aired opposite the Rock Awards on ABC, which ranked 55th. The regular Thursday 
night telecast of "48 Hours" placed a more normal 58th. The full list of 
ratings is on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* After two weeks on the air and two weeks in the Top 10 -- thanks in no small 
part to the lead-in from the ever-popular "Cheers" -- "Seinfeld" was picked up 
Tuesday by NBC for a regular season run. The comedy, starring Jerry Seinfeld, 
finished third in its first week and No. 8 last week (down about 1.8 million 
homes from the previous week). NBC, which had delayed putting the current batch 
of episodes on until after the season was over, ordered 13 episodes of the 
comedy for scheduling next year.

In an ideal universe, all rock albums would be titled "Adventure," or at least

Television did indeed claim "Adventure" as the title to its second LP, that's 
the whole point of the music.

"It always surprises me when I hear so many bands sounding like so many other 
bands," Verlaine said in a recent phone interview from his Manhattan apartment. 
"I always felt like there was an obligation to either do something fresh or to 
do something that somehow was like making something for yourself, really to 
surprise yourself." 
</P>
<P>
With Television then and in a solo career dotted with infrequent pulses of 
brilliance, the singer/songwriter/guitarist has created a body of songs that so 
sharply delineate interior emotional landscapes that they can seem like dreams 
held in place with a spike. 
</P>
<P>
Using a standard rock instrumentation, Verlaine's recordings construct 
multitiered architectures of sound, inhabited by a fearless fretboard style 
that shoves his electric guitar beyond the boundaries of musical reason. 
</P>
<P>
In light of his history of amplified excursions, Verlaine's current move 
certainly qualifies as adventurous. He has embarked on a solo acoustic tour, 
which began Tuesday at San Juan Capistrano's Coach House and continues tonight 
at Bogart's in Long Beach and Thursday and Friday at McCabe's -- with 
intentions of issuing an equally acoustic album later this year. But while at 
odds with practically everything he has put on record, the acoustic side is 
nothing new to Verlaine. 
</P>
<P>
"All the songs in the last bunch of years are written on acoustic guitar, and I 
started playing acoustic shows in '85 in Europe," he said, "It just had a 
certain appeal to me. Maybe it's an intimacy factor. It really puts you into 
your voice. And it actually puts you into your body in a way that electric 
music doesn't. It's a mystery to me, but it's something I like to hear and do." 
</P>
<P>
He initially wanted to do an acoustic album in 1984, but the idea was turned 
down by his record label, Phonogram in Britain. That proved to be the least of 
his troubles with the label, which, Verlaine claims, refused to issue one 
completed album and grievously remixed and delayed his last two releases, 
"Flash Light" and "The Wonder." The latter, recorded in 1988, wasn't issued in 
Europe until earlier this year, and remains unreleased in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If Verlaine's songs seem to be born of a dreamlike reverie, that isn't far from 
the actual source for many of them. "Pillow" on "The Wonder" is a haunting 
lullaby made up of fragmentary scenes from a relationship, some observed by a 
dove outside the couple's window. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the ideas I get seem to be when I'm falling asleep at night," 
Verlaine said. "I often hit this place where sometimes I can remember and 
sometimes I can't, but something goes on there. And sometimes it's literally 
like there's a bird there that you're having a conversation with. Often there's 
music there as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can wake myself out of it, or generally I kind of double up out of it -- 
it's a weird state -- I'll go to the tape deck and hum a melody, then fall 
asleep, and the next day I'll hear it and it'll bring some of that back." 
</P>
<P>
When not working on music or traveling -- he likes extended visits out of New 
York, such as the two months he spent in L.A. last year -- Verlaine pursues a 
fascination with the byways taken by the human mind. He says he once spent five 
months studying various psychoanalytic theories. 
</P>
<P>
"Or I hit moods where I want to learn about how somebody thought things that 
could be so foreign to me. It could be a poet, a theorist, a linguist, or a 
composer that grabs you. I was reading some letters by Liszt, and this guy's 
outlook is just so totally different from anything you would imagine for 
yourself, very courteous but ferocious, a strong character. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think these interests color what I write. But I think that it helps 
keep your brain strong by studying outlooks that are so foreign to your own. I 
try to work out 'How and why did this person ever develop this?' " 
</P>
<P>
And if someone were to pore over Verlaine's own works with such an intent? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'd say, 'Well, this guy's method was chaos.' " 
</P>

PICK A VIDEO: CABLE'S NEW JUKEBOX NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: WITH A $3 TELEPHONE CALL YOU CAN AVOID RAP OR HEAVY METAL OR SUGARY POP 
BY PROGRAMMING YOUR OWN VIDEOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the same old story -- or, in this case, the same old music video. 
</P>
<P>
You tune into MTV or VH-1 to catch your favorite video and find yourself 
quickly tuning out after you OD on rap, heavy metal and New Kids on the Block 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
What if there was a cable network that allowed the viewers to program the 
videos? 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Jukebox Network, what its backers call the first interactive cable-TV 
network. With a $3 phone call, you can pick the video you want to see. 
</P>
<P>
First tested in 1985, the Jukebox Network -- which is owned and operated by 
Miami-based Video Jukebox Network, Inc. -- is in 94 locations across the 
country and hopes to be in 30 more by year's end. It is carried locally by 
United Artists Cable, which serves Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys, Toluca Lake and 
Pacoima, Sammons Communications in Glendale and Comcast in northern Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
When no video is playing, a scroll appears on the screen, listing a succession 
of as many as 100 videos that can be ordered, from Phil Collins to Public 
Enemy, from Billy Joel to Billy Idol. The viewer notes the code number that 
appears to the left of the title, then calls the 900 or 976 phone number shown 
at the top of the screen and punches in the appropriate code. If the Jukebox 
Network isn't particularly busy, the video will start playing within two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company puts each call on the customer's bill and takes a small 
percentage of the $3 fee for itself. The balance goes to Video Jukebox Network, 
Inc., which in turn passes on some of the money to the cable company that 
generated the call -- usually 5 to 7 cents per call. 
</P>
<P>
That's part of the appeal to cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
"We say, 'You won't get rich with us, but you'll make some money,' " explained 
John Robson, director of corporate communications for Video Jukebox Network. 
"They are also looking for value-added programming, and the channel is locally 
originated and responds specifically to their viewers." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a smart move to put it on," said Dan MacKenzie, manager of pay-per-view 
entertainment services at United Artists, which has carried the Jukebox Network 
since December. "It's definitely paying for itself. It's just an additional 
piece of icing for the customers to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Sampling Jukebox on Sammons, though, one tends to see the scroll more often 
than videos. Sammons general manager Tom Robbins insisted, nonetheless, that 
Sammons is very pleased with the response from its customers. "Sometimes there 
is more activity than other times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The patented technology for the Jukebox Network was developed before anyone had 
a good idea of how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried things like classified ads, a movie guide and a real estate service," 
Robson said. Finally, someone hit on the idea of a video jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
The first video jukebox was launched on the TCI system in Miami on Dec. 20, 
1985. Two years later, another box was added in Jacksonville. After three more 
years of testing in Florida, national roll-out began on March 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most researched and developed projects," said Andy Orgell, 
president of Video Jukebox Network. "The product was fine-tuned while it was on 
the air and developed over a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Cable companies and subscribers don't need any extra equipment for the Jukebox 
channel. A box the size of a small refrigerator is placed in the cable company. 
It contains laser discs of the music videos and is activated by the viewer's 
phone call. 
</P>
<P>
"We can play something like half-a-million separate songs every month," Robson 
said. "There is no entity who can play as much music as we can." 
</P>
<P>
If there are videos that the system isn't carrying, viewers are invited to 
request them by calling a toll-free number. "We receive 50,000 calls a month," 
Robson said. 
</P>
<P>
The line is also used to lodge complaints. Les Garland, vice president of 
programming, maintains that only 4% of the calls find fault with the network 
and none complain about the cost of the videos. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not such a sensitivity about the phone bill," he said. "People seem 
to get their telephone bills and just pay it." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we have done from day one is pound the price home," Robson 
said. "We put the price right in the middle of the (TV) spot and we also put 
the price message on the phone message." 
</P>
<P>
Ordering a video through Sammons, though, the price message was delivered after 
the video was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Garland believes the network will be able to predict hits very quickly. "It's a 
very active audience," he said. "It's a 12- to 25-year-old audience. They are 
watching the network and telephoning in to make requests. They are also record 
purchasers. They are the trend-setting, on-the-cutting-edge kind of young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
A small number of videos are not available to the network because of the 
exclusivity MTV has with some record labels. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have world-premiered a number of videos," Robson said. "We have a great 
opportunity to show more videos than MTV because they don't play as many songs 
as we do. We have shown local videos that wouldn't fly anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Garland said that the network is not trying to "take on" MTV, where he formerly 
worked as programming vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"We really see the Jukebox as a place for people to come to discover the talent 
of tomorrow. It's an alternative music channel," he said. "It's the first 
alternative music channel that has come along since MTV in 1981. We can play 
things you are not going to hear on the radio or any of those other channels. I 
think the public has a desire to have a choice. It's the wide array of music 
which will position us." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact the Jukebox Network is now seen by nearly seven million 
customers, Orgell admits the public company hasn't turned a profit. "We did 
make an operating profit during the first quarter," he said. "But we are still 
not bottom line profitable -- yet." 
</P>
<P>
Video Jukebox Network sees itself primarily as an interactive company and not 
just a music company. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jukebox Network is our first product," Robson said. "We are committed this 
year to have another product line on the air. It will be nothing to do with 
music, but we are not 100% sure what it will be. We are looking at a lot of 
things."

SURVEY TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF L.A.'S ARTISTIC TASTES; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: THE STUDY WILL BE USED TO SHAPE LOS ANGELES' CULTURAL MASTERPLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau isn't the only organization that's got your number. If 
you're on the mailing list of any arts organization in L.A. County, you may 
receive a detailed survey this week asking questions about your theatergoing 
experiences, what prevents you from attending art exhibits, and where you like 
to go to see arts events. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-question survey -- 5,000 of which have been sent out to artists and 
audience members throughout the county -- is part of a study that will be used 
to shape Los Angeles' five-year Cultural Masterplan. An additional 2,000 
surveys will be mailed next week to arts organizations throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really important survey because it's an opportunity to collect 
information about all of the arts community," said Moira Adams, project manager 
for Morris McNeill, the L.A. research firm conducting the study. "The study 
will be used to set the goals and plans for arts spending for the next five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the 5,000 artists and arts goers who have been sent the study were 
chosen from 200,000 names compiled from nearly 100 mailing lists from diverse 
arts organizations such as the Music Center, the Korean Cultural Center and 
Plaza de la Raza. Those receiving the survey were chosen so as to reflect 
artists and audience members from all disciplines and ethnic groups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the audience survey, we ask questions about their general opinions, 
questions like what they want to see funded, where they want to see arts 
presented, what disciplines they're interested in, how often they attend, and 
what they think the purpose of art is," Adams said. "This will give us general 
opinion information as to how people perceive the arts and whether they think 
it is important for Los Angeles to be a major arts center." 
</P>
<P>
Adams explained that the survey's results will also be used for a Nexus Study 
that is required before the Percent for Art program -- which allocates 1% of 
the cost of private commercial developments to the city's arts fund -- can be 
put into effect. The latter study is the result of a new state law which 
requires that cities show a connection between fees on developments and what 
the revenues will be spent on. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to show a link between commercial development and increased cultural 
facilities, and we're hoping through this survey to get information on which to 
base that connection," Adams said. "What we want to show is that increased 
development brings more people into the area, which brings an increased burden 
on the cultural services. . . . (But) we expect some of the developers might 
challenge that connection in court, so our research has to be very sound so it 
stands up. . . . The response to this survey is very critical." 
</P>
<P>
Adams added that the artists' survey will ask questions about work spaces, 
demographics, funding and other areas in an attempt to "really get a sense of 
what their needs are . . . in all the disciplines and in all ethnic groups."

NEA CHAIRMAN'S TALK TO COVER TOPIC OF OBSCENE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts will speak at 
an open forum Saturday at the Lyceum Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
John Frohnmayer, appointed by President Bush last year, will talk about the 
controversy over reauthorizing the National Endowment for the Arts, said 
Victoria Hamilton, executive director of the San Diego Commission for Arts and 
Culture. The forum, which will include public questions and comment, will be 
held at 3:30 p.m. in the theater at 79 Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said the federal arts agency provides grants to San Diego arts 
organizations, the city arts commission and individual artists. Last year, San 
Diego received 28 NEA grants totaling $1.1 million, said Romalyn Tilghman, 
regional representative for the NEA in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA has been mired in controversy since last year when it awarded grants 
totaling $45,000 to two touring art exhibits: a show of photographs that 
included homoerotic and sexually explicit images by the late photographer 
Robert Mapplethorpe, and a show of works by award-winning artists that included 
an Andres Serrano photograph of a crucifix dipped in urine. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment's $171-million budget for 1990 was amended by conservatives in 
Congress to outlaw funding of artworks the NEA determines to be obscene, and 
requires grantees to take an anti-obscenity oath. In the uproar after the 
restrictions, the University of Iowa Press and New York theater producer Joseph 
Papp turned down $62,000 in NEA money. The New School for Social Research in 
New York City has sued the endowment to try to gain a court order to strike 
down on constitutional grounds the anti-obscenity oath. The provision requires 
grantees to certify in writing that they will not produce obscene work. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the NEA is faced with seeking congressional reauthorization and 
approval of its 1991 budget. The agency is usually reauthorized for five years, 
but, faced with a growing move among conservatives in Congress to clamp down on 
what some view as government funding of obscene art, the White House is seeking 
a cooling-off period. Instead of a five-year renewal, the White House asked 
Congress last Wednesday to reauthorize the NEA, without any restrictions, for 
one to three years while a commission reviews the agency's grant-making 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment's authorization is set to expire Sept. 30, the end of the 1990 
fiscal year. However, it is unclear whether Congress will have time to consider 
the White House request and the proposed $175-million budget for 1991 before 
recessing for week beginning July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer, the NEA's fifth chairman, is also in San Diego to give a keynote 
speech at a convention of the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies. The 
service organization is a coalition of municipal and nonprofit arts 
organizations, arts leaders and corporate representatives, Hamilton said. The 
convention, June 15-19, is expected to draw more than 500 arts leaders from the 
United States, Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer is former chairman of the Oregon Arts Commission and was most 
recently a partner in a Portland law firm. He also served as chairman of the 
screening committee to select art for the Oregon Capitol. His performing 
background as a singer includes appearances in musical productions in New York, 
Chicago, California and Oregon.

GIVING IN TO VOCAL FOES, ITALY KILLS BID FOR VENICE WORLD FAIR

<P>
Surrendering to an angry opposition that ranged from international 
environmentalists and art lovers to hometown politicians and gondoliers, the 
Italian government Tuesday formally withdrew Venice's candidacy as site of a 
world's fair in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute decision was a major defeat for Italian Prime Minister Giulio 
Andreotti and Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, a persuasive and ambitious 
Venetian who had spearheaded the campaign for Expo 2000 in Venice and almost 
single-handedly engineered initial government backing for it. 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of the candidacy brought applause Tuesday across the Italian 
political spectrum, from Communists to Social Democrats to neo-fascists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a victory of reason over speculation," said Gianni Tamino, a Green 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"A senseless plan has failed, and thus Venice can breathe a sigh of relief," 
said Carlo Ripa di Meana, the Italian who is the European Community's 
environmental commissioner, and a member of De Michelis' Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Vocal international and domestic opposition to Venice's candidacy, which 
climaxed this week with a revolt in the Italian Parliament, focused on concern 
for the environmental health of the delicate, tourist-besieged lagoon city that 
is universally regarded as a priceless landmark of world heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a relentless onslaught of day-trippers, 1,200-year-old Venice is being 
abandoned by the Venetians. Since World War II, the population has dropped by 
about two-thirds to a current 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
De Michelis and supporters of Expo 2000 contended that the exhibition would 
reinvigorate the city. The number of visitors could be controlled, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
Venice's withdrawal leaves Toronto and Hanover, West Germany, as contestants 
for the fair.

ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS TAKE LEAD IN ALGERIA VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH AFRICA: THE RULING PARTY TRAILS IN THE FIRST MULTI-PARTY BALLOTING SINCE 
1962.

<TEXT>
<P>
Algeria, the feisty revolutionary republic that surprised the world nearly 
three decades ago by throwing off French colonial rule, opened its first door 
to democracy Tuesday when voters cast their ballots in the first multi-party 
election since independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
At voting stations ranging from schools in teeming downtown slums to mobile 
voting trucks to remote Bedouin desert camps, Algerians considered the first 
official challenge to the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) and prepared 
to decide the future of one of the most powerful Muslim fundamentalist 
movements in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Although final results were not available, Interior Minister Mohammed Salah 
Mohammedi reported early today that the Arab world's first legalized Islamic 
party, the Islamic Salvation Front, (FIS) had surged into the lead, leaving the 
FLN in second place. 
</P>
<P>
Ten new opposition parties fielded candidates against the FLN, the party that 
presided over Algeria's bloody battle for independence and subsequent evolution 
into one of the Middle East's few bastions of socialism. It launched an 
egalitarian experiment in open education and free health care that began 
sinking in recent years with dwindling oil prices and a sluggish state-run 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in municipal and provincial elections is not only the future of 
President Chadli Bendjedid's political reforms but also how those reforms will 
stand up against the Salvation Front, the muscular Muslim fundamentalist 
movement. It is seeking to enlist the hundreds of thousands of unemployed youth 
who populate the streets of Algiers and other urban centers in a campaign to 
turn Algeria into a conservative Islamic state. 
</P>
<P>
Affluent Algerians who grew up under the influence of the FLN are alarmed at 
the growing apparent power of the fundamentalist party, as are governments 
throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean. They are looking to the 
results of balloting in Algeria for an indication of the growing political 
power of radical Muslims in what has historically been moderate regions of the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Abassi Madani, the spiritual leader of the FIS, has predicted that the party 
will gain 75% of the vote, and at a press conference Monday, he warned that he 
might not be able to control his followers if there is evidence that the 
government has rigged the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and government officials here say privately that they do not 
expect the FIS to gain anywhere near 75% of the vote, but even the 30% that 
many analysts predict could spell trouble for the ruling FLN, which still holds 
all the seats in the national assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's balloting covers only about 1,800 municipalities and 
provincial councils, many predict that the failure of the FLN to maintain a 
credible majority of the vote could force the president to dissolve Parliament 
and schedule national elections much sooner than 1992, when deputies' present 
terms expire. 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers here say the FLN's problem is that the majority of 
Algerians have been born since the revolution.

'ALARMING' INCREASE IN AIDS REPORTED; 
</P>
<P>
EPIDEMIC: U.N. AGENCY PREDICTS 6 MILLION CASES BY THE YEAR 2000. DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES ARE HARDEST HIT.

The World Health Organization on Tuesday predicted a cumulative global total of 
at least 6 million cases of AIDS by the year 2000, with "an alarming rate" of 
increase of new infections in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
Also, 15 million to 20 million people around the world could be infected with 
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS by the year 2000 because of 
the soaring rate of new infections in developing countries, WHO said in 
updating its worldwide AIDS projections. 
</P>
<P>
"If the situation in Africa continues to increase and if we continue to see a 
rapid rise of infections in Asia and Latin America, then I think these 
estimates we're giving are minimum," Dr. Michael H. Merson, director of the WHO 
global AIDS program, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The projections are more pessimistic than those of about a year ago. Although 
WHO initially released similar figures at that time, they were then considered 
middle-range estimates, rather than the lowest possible. 
</P>
<P>
Six million to 8 million people worldwide -- or about one of every 400 adults 
-- are now infected with HIV. Most of them ultimately will become ill "unless 
therapeutic drugs are developed soon," WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
The international health organization said that it is "very unlikely" that the 
global prevalence of AIDS infections will stabilize or level off for at least 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
As of this year, about 60% of all global infections had resulted from 
heterosexual intercourse. WHO predicted that by the year 2000, 75% to 80% of 
all HIV infections will result from heterosexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where there has been a cumulative total of more than 
132,000 AIDS cases, the majority of cases have occurred among homosexual and 
bisexual men. 
</P>
<P>
However, WHO said that heterosexual transmission of AIDS infection is 
increasing slowly in industrial nations, especially in urban areas with high 
rates of other sexually transmitted diseases and intravenous drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
"Large numbers of uninfected IV drug users remain in many areas, and explosive 
spread might occur among them if they continue their risk behavior," WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
In North America, WHO estimates, one in every 75 men is HIV infected. In South 
America, the estimate is one in 125 men; in Western Europe, one in 200. 
</P>
<P>
Among women, WHO estimated that one in 700 women in North America is infected; 
in South America, one in 500 women; in Western Europe, one in 1,400. In Eastern 
Europe, Asia and the Pacific region, there are about 50,000 infected women, or 
one in 20,000, WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
Saying "it is clear that the global balance of HIV infections is rapidly 
tipping toward the developing countries," WHO noted that in 1985 about half of 
the world total of infections were in developing countries. Today, WHO said, 
the developing world accounts for an estimated 66%, and the figure is expected 
to reach 80% to 90% by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
"The world outlook is increasingly somber," Dr. June Osborn, a member of WHO's 
Global Commission on AIDS, said in an interview. "In particular, we've seen a 
startling emergence of new HIV infections related to intravenous drug use and 
subsequent sexual spread in Southeast Asia that reminds us of the flash-fire 
potential everywhere when HIV and illicit drug use are combined." 
</P>
<P>
The current level of infection is "most acute" in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said, 
estimating that about 3.5 million people were HIV-infected by mid-1989. These 
figures include 1.5 million to 2 million women. WHO estimated that one of every 
50 adult men and women in sub-Saharan Africa is now infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
Further, as of this year, about 200,000 HIV-infected infants had been born in 
Africa, and by the end of the decade, "an additional million or more may be 
expected," WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
As of mid-1990, more than 250,000 new cases of AIDS have been reported from 
more than 150 countries, WHO said. But because of under-recognition, 
under-reporting and delays in reporting, the health organization said that it 
estimates that nearly 700,000 cases may have already occurred.

SOVIETS, EGYPT ASK PLO TO SAVE U.S. TALKS, BAKER SAYS

The foreign ministers of at least seven nations, including Egypt and the Soviet 
Union, have agreed to call on the Palestine Liberation Organization to save its 
dialogue with the United States by repudiating and punishing the perpetrator of 
an abortive terrorist attack on Israeli beaches, Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he has not yet decided 
whether to break off contact with the PLO over the May 30 attack on crowded 
beaches near Tel Aviv by the Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO splinter group. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that "an extraordinarily large number of our allies and friendly 
governments" have warned that suspending the dialogue would damage the 
prospects for Middle East peace. Baker said he agreed that the U.S.-PLO 
contact, now in its 18th month, "has important implications for the 
Arab-Israeli peace process." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he discussed the matter last week in Europe with the foreign 
ministers of Britain, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Turkey and the Soviet 
Union and by telephone with the foreign minister of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"Each and every one of these ministers responded by saying that they would go 
to the PLO and urge it to take steps to condemn the act and to disassociate 
from it," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, President Bush told reporters that he raised the issue by 
telephone with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see this terroristic act condemned," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
All seven nations have maintained cordial relations with the PLO over the years 
and are thought to exert substantial influence over the organization. The 
Soviet Union has been the organization's primary source of military equipment, 
and Egypt has sought to represent the PLO's interests in talks with the United 
States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that the PLO will follow their advice. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the assault, which Israeli forces thwarted, leaving four 
attackers dead and 12 in custody, the Bush Administration said that it would 
have to break off the talks unless the PLO unambiguously condemned the raid and 
took steps to punish PLF leader Abul Abbas, who claimed responsibility for the 
action. Abbas is a member of the PLO's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, the PLO's public and private responses have fallen short of the 
mark," Baker said. "The PLO official statements have disassociated the PLO from 
the May 30 attack, but neither the May 31 statement in Baghdad issued after the 
executive committee meeting, nor (Monday's) statement condemned the PLF attack 
in its own right. And moreover, they gave no indication that the PLO intends to 
begin to take steps to discipline Abul Abbas." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government and its American supporters, who have opposed the 
U.S.-PLO dialogue since its inception in December, 1988, cited the attack as 
proof that the PLO is not keeping its commitment to give up use of terrorism.

QUERY ON CIA TIE TO MANDELA CASE DEFLECTED 
</P>

<P>
The White House, embarrassed by stories linking the CIA to Nelson Mandela's 
arrest 28 years ago, tried Tuesday to shift attention away from President Bush 
and toward his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Bush would apologize to Mandela for reported U.S. involvement in his 
1962 arrest when the two men meet June 25, White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater initially refused to make any comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We find no value in reviewing a 30-year-old history in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, however, Fitzwater changed his stance. 
</P>
<P>
"This happened during the (John F.) Kennedy Administration," he said. "If you 
want to ask Pierre Salinger or Nicholas Katzenbach or Jack Kennedy or Teddy, go 
do it. But don't beat me up for what the Kennedy people did." 
</P>
<P>
Salinger was President Kennedy's press secretary and Katzenbach the deputy 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't like it when people question our motives on blacks or on Mandela 
because of an incident that happened 20 years ago in another administration," 
Fitzwater added. "Go ask the Kennedy Administration." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) declined to comment on 
Fitzwater's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later in the day whether he would apologize to Mandela, Bush said that he 
is not sure. He has "not looked into" the reports of CIA involvement, Bush 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The focus on the CIA's role in Mandela's arrest began Sunday with a story by 
the Cox Newspapers chain reporting that a CIA agent in South Africa at the time 
had played a key role in helping South African authorities find and arrest the 
African National Congress leader. Mandela served nearly 28 years in prison from 
the time of his arrest until released in February. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's unusually testy reaction to the questions reflected a general White 
House discomfort over policy toward South Africa that has deepened as Mandela's 
visit nears.

FBI EASING POLICY ON WHEN TO SHOOT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: AGENTS WOULD BE PERMITTED TO FIRE AT FLEEING SUSPECTS THEY BELIEVE HAVE 
KILLED SOMEONE. SOME SEE PLAN AS A BAD EXAMPLE FOR OTHER POLICE AGENCIES.

<P>
The FBI -- long a voice of restraint in police use of deadly force -- is 
changing its policy to permit agents to fire at suspects fleeing from crimes in 
which they are believed to have killed or seriously injured another or 
attempted to do so, it was learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy would also allow shooting at a fleeing suspect who is believed 
to be armed and has a history of killing or attempting to kill, government 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The shift from a standard that permitted agents to fire only in self-defense or 
to protect innocent people from death or serious injury occurs as police 
officers are facing mounting danger, particularly in drug cases, supporters of 
the policy noted. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Director William S. Sessions signed off on the new policy only after sharp 
debate inside the agency, where opponents contended that the looser standard 
would subject the bureau to intense criticism and set a dangerous example for 
police departments in which officers get less training than FBI agents, 
according to the sources. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Davenport, the FBI's chief spokesman, refused to confirm or deny the policy 
shift, but sources familiar with it provided the details on condition that they 
not be named. 
</P>
<P>
The broader discretion is being extended to agents just as the FBI is changing 
its issued weapons from .38-caliber revolvers to 10-millimeter semiautomatic 
pistols capable of firing more rounds faster. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, which has yet to be disseminated to agents in the field, will 
also permit agents to fire warning shots if that can be done without risk to 
innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who is traveling in Europe, said: 
"That proposal has not come to the attorney general's office." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was suggesting that department officials have reservations 
about the new policy, spokesman Dan Eramian said: "I can't comment one way or 
another." Thornburgh could order the policy reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
civil and constitutional rights, which watches over the FBI, said that he hopes 
the bureau will re-examine the new policy. "I'm not at all sure it's a good 
idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards stressed the FBI's status as a role model for smaller police agencies 
in expressing his doubts about the shift. "The FBI is looked upon as the model 
police agency of the world -- the elite," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The current, more restrictive standard "seems to be a responsible one," Edwards 
said. "If a few people are not captured or shot, I don't think the crime wave 
will get out of control." But a bureau source who supports the new policy said 
that it has been made necessary by "the increased exposure and incidents of 
shootings that our special agents are encountering on the street and the amount 
of danger they are exposed to. There's no question that it's drugs." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the source conceded being concerned "from a leadership point 
of view. In the hands of a highly trained law enforcement officer, the policy 
is appropriate," he said. "But for a police officer with minimum training who 
is confronted with a complex situation," it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Fyfe, a former New York City police lieutenant who now teaches police 
and law enforcement at American University here and frequently serves as an 
expert witness in police shooting cases, said he was "sorry to see the change. 
The bureau's example was very important." 
</P>
<P>
Fyfe said that he is surprised that the FBI plans to permit warning shots when 
pursuing persons suspected of killing or seriously injuring others. 
</P>
<P>
"What goes up must come down," Fyfe said of warning shots, adding that he knows 
of cases in which police officers fired shots unjustifiably, then claimed that 
they were warning shots. 
</P>
<P>
"The only big municipal (police) department that permits warning shots is San 
Jose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In permitting warning shots, the bureau's policy, which until now has been 
"shoot to kill," provides that the warning fire must not constitute risk to an 
innocent person, such as a bystander watching from a second-floor window. 
</P>
<P>
Both present and incoming agents will be given "a very rigorous block of new 
training" to carry out their broader discretion, a federal law enforcement 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is in line with the March 27, 1985, ruling by the Supreme Court 
that struck down as unconstitutional a Tennessee law authorizing police to use 
"all necessary means" to apprehend escaping suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In that ruling, the court said also: "If the suspect threatens the officer with 
a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime 
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, 
deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape and if, where feasible, 
some warning has been given." 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the policy shift attributed it in part to the April 11, 
1986, shoot-out near Miami in which two FBI agents were slain and five were 
wounded, along with two heavily armed bank robbery suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, FBI agent Edmundo Mireles Jr., despite serious wounds, 
dragged himself to an automobile and killed both suspects. Mireles, who took a 
year to recover from his wounds, received a Justice Department award and in 
April became the first recipient of the FBI's medal of valor. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the incident said that Mireles may have technically 
violated the FBI's policy that shots are to be fired only in self-defense. By 
the time Mireles reached the suspects' car, they had stopped shooting.

HATCH ACT REVISION PASSED OVER WARNINGS OF A VETO

<P>
The House, ignoring the Bush Administration's most recent veto threat, Tuesday 
gave final congressional approval to legislation that would lift a 50-year-old 
prohibition against federal employees engaging in partisan political activity 
in their off-duty hours. 
</P>
<P>
The representatives voted 334 to 87, 52 votes more than the two-thirds majority 
required to override a veto, for a Senate-passed revision of the Hatch Act and 
sent it to the President over fresh objections from Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the change said it would mean "political emancipation for 3 million 
federal workers." Opponents said it would "politicize" the civil service and 
undermine public confidence in the U.S. government's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The vote in the Senate was 67 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Hatch Act, enacted in 1939, was designed to insulate federal employees and 
postal workers from political pressures. Advocates of the change, however, said 
that about 80% of federal workers today are protected by civil service rules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big deal to give them a right to participate in the political 
process if they want," said Rep. Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.). He said federal 
workers have a stake in the political process because of recent cuts in their 
benefits and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to . . . allow federal employees, on their own time, just like 
their neighbors, to exercise the basic, fundamental rights of political 
participation that the rest of us enjoy," Rep. William D. Ford (D-Mich.), floor 
manager for the bill, said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh protested that the measure would permit "virtually unbridled 
partisan activities by federal employees, which -- history shows -- would in 
turn inevitably lead to the politicization of public administration." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general argued that the legislation would, for example, permit 
district managers of the Internal Revenue Service to serve as officers of 
political parties after working hours and allow loan officers of the federal 
housing agency to organize partisan campaigns in their off-duty time. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe, on the basis of experience, that most federal employees . . . 
simply have no desire to politicize their lives and their jobs by engaging in 
partisan activity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is, we think, significant that there has been no groundswell of popular 
support for this bill from the ranks of federal civil servants," Thornburgh 
added in a letter to Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the House minority whip. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), who led the opposition to the bill on the House 
floor, said the change would help the Democratic Party more than the GOP. The 
bill allows federal workers to make political donations only to a labor 
organization's political action committee, and Armey said that union PACs 
overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates in their contributions.

TANKER SPILL THREAT IN GULF GENERATES POLITICAL FALLOUT;

<P>
For three tense days, many feared that the crippled Norwegian tanker Mega Borg 
could leave a wake of oil three times larger than last year's 11-million-gallon 
Exxon Valdez spill. Now those fears are easing, but the political fallout is 
just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
From the Galveston City Council to environmentalists in Washington, the Mega 
Borg explosion has added yet more fuel to the controversy over offshore oil 
operations and development. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16 months since the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound, there have been an estimated 10,000 oil spills on land 
and water, including major spills off Huntington Beach, Calif., and in New York 
harbor, and now the spectacular blaze in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In Austin, the capital of this state traditionally friendly to oil, there were 
renewed calls for increased liability limits on oil spills and far greater 
readiness to quickly respond to spills. At this point, powers taken for granted 
by California state officials, such as conducting oil spill response drills, 
have hardly been exercised here. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, the state has joined in only one spill response drill and 
that was two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Galveston City Council later this week is scheduled to take up a resolution 
urging the federal government to step up regulation of offshore oil transfer 
operations, known as lightering. County commissioners are expected to take up 
the issue next week. The explosion last Saturday occurred during such an 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, environmentalists renewed their calls for switching 
to what they say are safer energy alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
There was also speculation that the spill may have caused yet another delay by 
President Bush in announcing his decision on whether to push ahead with new oil 
and gas drilling off the coasts of California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The President on Tuesday said he would announce his decision "very soon now." 
</P>
<P>
"The political process always responds to emergencies. It's amazing how things 
are raised on the radar screen much more quickly," said Thomas Henderson, 
executive assistant to Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, an elected official 
who oversees management of 4.5 million acres of state submerged lands, bays, 
beaches and estuaries. 
</P>
<P>
While local and state officials here are not calling for an end to offshore oil 
operations and development, as have some in California, they are nonetheless 
calling for new restrictions and safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
The threat from the spill appeared to have diminished on Tuesday, but concern 
remained that any reversal in the ship's condition resulting in a catastrophic 
spill would threaten sensitive bird estuaries as well as the fishing, shrimp 
and tourist industries. 
</P>
<P>
Galveston Bay includes the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and Matagorda 
Island, both the homes of waterbirds that are currently breeding. There were 
also concerns for two endangered species, the Ridley sea turtle and brown 
pelican. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the second-worst time of the year for oil to hit the beaches," said 
William Reffalt of the Wilderness Society. A worse time, he said, would have 
been during the winter and spring migrations. 
</P>
<P>
Galveston Mayor Barbara Crews said the message to the oil industry is clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community is very concerned. We would like better coordination, quicker 
response and more regulation so this kind of potential disaster does not occur 
without extraordinary precautions and preparations being taken before hand," 
Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
As modest as the resolution may seem to some, she said it is the kind of 
council action that might not have come up before. The four counties around 
Galveston Bay comprise a major refining and and petrochemical center. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Whitledge, a senior research scientist with the University of Texas 
Marine Science Institute who helped win national estuary status for Galveston 
Bay, said the public is beginning to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain public apathy that has been in the system. I think we're 
starting to realize that kind of apathy catches up with us. I think the public 
is tending to pay more attention to the accidents they are hearing about and 
kind of wondering if there is something we should be doing about it," Whitledge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the year since the Exxon Valdez accident, oil spill liability legislation 
has remained stalled in Congress, tied up in a joint House-Senate conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The impasse, in turn, has resulted in the oil industry postponing the 
operational date for its promised five regional oil spill response teams first 
announced last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some hope the Texas spill will spur action.

SENATE NARROWLY SUSTAINS VETO OF AMTRAK SUBSIDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting arguments that the nation's passenger rail service was at stake, the 
Senate on Tuesday narrowly upheld President Bush's veto of continued federal 
subsidies for the Amtrak railway system. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats fell just two votes short of winning the two-thirds majority 
needed to hand the President what would have been his first defeat on a veto 
override. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has rejected 11 bills in his 17 months in office, and all the vetoes have 
been sustained -- although some, such as the Amtrak bill, were upheld by slim 
margins only after intense lobbying on the part of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak vote was 64 to 36. Republicans on their way to the President's 66th 
birthday party turned up in formal dress to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), however, served notice that 
the Democrats have not given up on the Amtrak issue. He switched sides and 
voted to sustain the veto at the last minute. That gave the Democrats another 
chance to defeat the veto, since parliamentary rules allow a member of the 
winning side to request reconsideration of a vote. The House voted, 294 to 123, 
to override the Amtrak veto last week. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell did not indicate when he would schedule another Senate vote. 
Congressional sources said that he obviously hopes substantial popular support 
for the Amtrak legislation will generate enough lobbying pressure in coming 
days to switch at least two Republican votes. 
</P>
<P>
"A vote against Amtrak is always a loser. There is no political capital in 
voting with the President on this," conceded an aide to one Republican who 
supported the veto. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, all but 10 Republicans voted with the Administration, but many of 
them appeared to have done so reluctantly and because of intensive White House 
lobbying led by Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Transportation Secretary 
Samuel K. Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.), the bill's Democratic floor manager, said that some 
Republicans also may have been swayed by the fact that they were on their way 
to the President's birthday party. There was "some talk" that sustaining the 
veto would be "the good and kind thing to do" on Bush's birthday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although an override would have had symbolic importance, breaking Bush's 
winning streak on veto votes, both Democrats and Republicans sought to play 
down suggestions that the political significance of the vote went beyond the 
merits of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no strong political message here like there was in the fight over 
the Chinese-students veto," one Democratic congressional source said. "This 
fight was over one relatively narrow provision in the Amtrak bill." 
</P>
<P>
That provision, which the White House denounced as "reregulation," would 
subject certain types of railroad acquisitions to closer scrutiny from the 
Interstate Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Bush cited this as his sole reason for vetoing the bill on May 24, and offered 
to sign a substitute bill without the ICC provision. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats said it could take weeks or months to pass a new bill through all the 
committees having jurisdiction over it.

90-YEAR-OLDS SHOW GAINS IN WEIGHT-TRAINING STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At an age when most of their contemporaries are worrying about simply keeping 
their blood pumping through their veins, 90-year-olds in a nursing home in 
Boston have been pumping iron. 
</P>
<P>
The frail, institutionalized men and women have undertaken regular weight 
training to improve their strength and mobility and thereby reduce their 
susceptibility to injury in falls and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the six women and four men in the original pilot program improved their 
strength threefold to fourfold over an eight-week period, and all except one 
who dropped out because of a previous hernia are "stronger than they had been 
many years previously," physicians from Tufts University report today in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the patients who walked with a cane at the beginning of the program can 
now manage without it, one can rise from a chair without using his arms for the 
first time in years, and five of them walk 50% faster. All are more mobile, 
have better balance and have suffered fewer falls since the training began, 
said geriatrician Maria A. Fiatarone of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this study is that it shows that, even at a very advanced 
age, physical frailty is treatable," said Evan C. Hadley, chief of the 
geriatric branch at the National Institute on Aging. "This could greatly reduce 
the need for nursing home admissions by maintaining the mobility of older 
people and thus their ability to live independently." 
</P>
<P>
According to census figures, more than 3.5 million Americans are over the age 
of 85 and 1 million are over 90. 
</P>
<P>
The study was so successful, Fiatarone said in a telephone interview, that the 
pilot trials have now been extended to about 30 additional people, one of whom 
is 100 years old, at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged, and the first 
subjects have been enrolled in a continuing weight-training program. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the positive results from this pilot study, the National 
Institute on Aging and the National Center for Nursing Research have awarded 
$2.9 million to the Hebrew Center and seven other institutions for further 
studies on this and other interventions for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"The exciting results from this study really served as an impetus for 
developing the (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention 
Techniques) research project," Hadley said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 people in the original program ranged in age from 86 to 96, with an 
average of 90. They had an average of 4.5 chronic diseases and had been 
institutionalized for an average of 3.4 years. Eight had a history of falls and 
seven habitually used a cane or walker. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects used a resistance training device. Sitting in a chair, they raised 
one leg at a time to lift a weight. At the beginning of the study, they could 
lift 17 pounds per leg on average. By the end, they could lift an average of 45 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
That response, Fiatarone and her colleagues wrote, "is remarkable in light of 
their very advanced age, extremely sedentary habits, multiple chronic disease 
and functional disabilities and nutritional inadequacies." 
</P>
<P>
Fiatarone emphasized that, like younger people, the patients lost some of their 
gains if they stopped exercising. When the subjects were assessed four weeks 
after the end of the pilot test, they had lost 30% of the strength they gained. 
Most went back to exercising.

A state appeals court on Tuesday upheld the conviction of Rep. Donald E. (Buz) 
Lukens on a charge that he had sex with a teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Middletown Republican was convicted in May, 1989, of a 
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor. He was accused 
of paying a girl to have sex with him at his Columbus apartment in November, 
1988, when she was 16. 
</P>
<P>
A Franklin County Domestic Relations judge sentenced Lukens to 30 days in jail 
and fined him $500. He has been free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
Lukens finished third in a field of four GOP candidates in the 8th District 
primary election in May.

SHOE BUSINESS' STAR-STUDDED SNEAKER WARS

L.A. Gear signed Michael Jackson and Paula Abdul, Converse tagged Magic 
Johnson, Nike managed to lure the elusive Spike Lee. Now, Reebok is hustling to 
pull out what could be the ultimate plum -- Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
But this isn't show biz, it's shoe biz. Forget technical advancements, comfort, 
quality of performance. In the war among athletic shoe manufacturers, the race 
is on to capture the most celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Recall all the famous faces you've seen in recent commercials for running, 
dancing and working-out footwear. The list seems all but endless. Margot 
Kidder, "Saturday Night Live" comedian Victoria Jackson, even earthy Aretha 
Franklin, are now striking active poses for magazine ads featuring V-striped 
Tretorn tennies. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Abdul and superstar Jackson, L.A. Gear products are plugged by 
Priscilla Presley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar while basketball whiz Jordan and 
football/baseball switch hitter Bo "You Don't Know Diddley" Jackson, along with 
Spike Lee, are stumping for Nike. 
</P>
<P>
VPs at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., are convinced that their company's 
celebrity endorsement program helped it grab 26% of the total $5-billion 
athletic footwear market in 1989. VPs at Reebok, where sales of $1.8 billion 
worldwide were posted last year, say the same. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with Madonna have been slowed by her recent worldwide concert 
tour. But Reebok executives hope for even greater financial reports in 1990 if 
they finally do book her, said Rob Apatoff, vice president of marketing for the 
Massachusetts-based company. 
</P>
<P>
Just to show how intense the competition can be, Madonna is threatening to sue 
Nike for $4.25 million she says is owed her for an endorsement contract. Nike 
claims they did nothing more than talk about a contract. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrity sell is hardly new, but with the plethora of younger stars now 
promoting athletic footwear, the trend is bigger than ever. Active wear 
companies concede, however, that such talents don't come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jackson is said to be collecting $20 million for his L.A. Gear 
endorsement, scheduled to blast across the airwaves as of August. The company's 
marketing executives do not confirm or deny dollar estimates, but they do say 
celebrity endorsements are well worth their hefty price tags. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a great commercial, but your recognition factor is far higher 
with a celebrity," said Sandy Saemann, executive vice president for L.A. Gear. 
Saemann added that the price his company pays to secure big names is not out of 
line, based upon the company's costs of producing its slick commercials and 
buying air time. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear recently announced a loss of about $365 million in second-quarter 
profits, but Saemann said that was related to problems caused by sales of 
"promotional" or off-price models and had nothing to do with the high price the 
company pays for celebrity endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jackson sold millions and millions of dollars in footwear," for the 
company, he said. Another star in the L.A. Gear galaxy, San Francisco 49er Joe 
Montana, also did very well, he added. 
</P>
<P>
How are the celebrities selected? Methods and reasons vary from company to 
company. When it comes to lining up L.A. Gear's roster, "gut feeling," as well 
as the celebrity's personal interest in the product plays a big role. And, of 
course, star quality is also a factor in deciding who gets tapped for a 
commercial role, according to Saemann, who is instrumental in making final 
decisions on L.A. Gear endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is not a mutual admiration, and the striking of a friendship on a 
personal basis, then there's no deal," said Saemann. "I want to be able to drop 
by Joe's," he said, casually referring to Montana, "and see him wearing L.A. 
Gear shoes because he likes them." 
</P>
<P>
As for personal interest, a number of celebrity endorsers take a direct hand in 
styling the products they wear. Gear's Saemann said Paula Abdul was "enticed" 
to sign with the company in May by offering her a signature line of active wear 
and sport shoes that she will be actively involved in designing. 
</P>
<P>
Pro golfer Greg Norman, who wears and endorses Nike footwear and golf fashions 
while playing on the PGA tour, was encouraged to shape the look and style of 
the collection that features his name. 
</P>
<P>
"Like many of our other endorsers, he is very particular about what he wears," 
said Apatoff. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had tremendous input into how the Air Jordan shoe would look, according 
to Fred Schreyer, director of sports marketing for Nike. He met with designers 
to give them his ideas and inspired their final product. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're talking about key guys like him, the shoes reflect the athlete," he 
said. "The styles reflect their personalities and are built around their 
image." 
</P>
<P>
In a particularly pampering move, Nike offers bonuses, or performance 
incentives, to its team of celebrity endorsers. These are additional revenues 
promised if the endorsed product exceeds certain sales expectations. Some 
athletes have it in their contract that they also will receive extra dollars if 
their own career takes a giant leap forward. 
</P>
<P>
At Tretorn, a division of the Etonic company based in Brockton, Mass., the use 
of celebrity tie-ins is in its infancy. Only in the last three months have 
Margot Kidder, Aretha Franklin and Victoria Jackson appeared in ads. 
</P>
<P>
Although not involved in developing the fashion look of her footwear, Jackson 
said, she did become involved in planning her photograph for the ad. She is 
pictured doing a handstand, in a shot that took quite some time to get right. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the handstand for about an hour and a half," said the blond New Yorker, 
who is the daughter of a gymnastics coach. "I guess I can't blame them since it 
was my idea." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other celebrities who pose for athletic wear, Jackson gets her share 
of free Tretorns, a perk she prefers to the freebies she has received for 
appearing in other commercials. She didn't care for the dozen free bottles of 
Amaretto liqueur she received when she posed in an ad for that company. "It's 
pretty fattening," she said of the after-dinner drink. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the 25-year-old Tretorn company relied on sales to come from word 
of mouth and a cult following of college coeds and aging preppies. They decided 
to go the celebrity circuit, said marketing director Deborah Dumel, to woo a 
new target audience, aged 15 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, we have been pretty low-key, but we are in a more competitive 
market these days," Dumel said. "Celebrity connections appeal to the youth." 
</P>
<P>
While the others race to catch Nike, they aren't exactly imitating that 
company's approach, since it doesn't often use Hollywood faces to peddle its 
products. Along with Bo Jackson, other current Nike endorsers include tennis 
stars John McEnroe and Andre Agassi, as well as American runners Joan Benoit, 
Lynn Jennings, and Patti Sue Plumer. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of them are household names, but Nike isn't worried. "If celebrities 
choose to wear our products, that is great. But they are not as important to 
the positioning of the brand as athletes are," Schreyer said. "Most are 
well-known to our target audience, but that isn't why we select them. We do it 
because they are authentically athletic." 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Gear, Saemann said, the game plan is to maintain its celebrity 
endorsement program with a diversified team of star representatives, to attract 
the company's target market -- an international audience. The line-up of sports 
figures, such as Abdul-Jabbar, Houston Rocket hoopster Akeem Olajuwon and Karl 
Malone of the Utah Jazz basketball team, may appeal to American sports fans. 
But such music industry superstars as Abdul and Jackson, who have an 
international following, come in handy since, as Saemann put it, "Joe Montana 
just doesn't play in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
But he might. 
</P>
<P>
At least one jock who poses for Nike ads has picked up other work. "Bo Jackson, 
who has been used heavily in our ads, got an AT&amp;T commercial," said Nike's 
Schreyer. "We feel that the relationships are good for both parties."

SENIORS ARE DITCHING SCHOOL AND NO ONE, IT SEEMS, CAN STOP THEM

Surrounded by classmates, the three honor students from San Fernando High 
School are baking on the sands of Zuma Beach. Clad in neon trunks, their toes 
dug into the sand, they are immersed in the three R's: rays, rap and 
relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
And it's just the beginning of what should be fourth-period class. 
</P>
<P>
"You only live once -- that's our motto," says Alex Padilla, 17, the student 
body president. "This is living." 
</P>
<P>
Senior ditch day has arrived for the San Fernando students, and they have lots 
of company. Echoing the general sentiment, "Let's get lost," graduating seniors 
from at least four other Southern California high schools also are playing 
hooky at Zuma Beach this day. It's a tradition that other schools have already 
honored in recent weeks and one that will be observed this week as well, just 
days before public schools close on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Ditch day, in which students take the day off "unofficially" and flee from 
teachers, classrooms and tardy bells, has become a ritual that ranks right up 
there with prom night. Many students will get their parents to excuse them from 
classes. Others confess they will forge their own excuse notes so they can 
worship the sun in Malibu, ride Magic Mountain's Viper roller coaster or hang 
out at the mall. Indeed, before L.A. city schools sound the final bell of the 
semester, hundreds, if not thousands, of the 25,581 graduating seniors will 
have ditched for a day. 
</P>
<P>
And no one, it seems -- not even the feared assistant principal -- can stop 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mishef, San Fernando's assistant principal, throws his arms up in 
disbelief when he hears that an extra 200 to 250 students, most of them 
seniors, are reported absent, a direct result of ditch day. "You generally know 
it's coming," Mishef says about the unsanctioned holiday last Friday. "You know 
because it's usually the day before the prom. 
</P>
<P>
"You try your best to tell kids to stay in school. You tell them you're going 
to call their parents when they are absent. You tell them it's not a free day 
and that we frown on it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"But the students -- even though they are good students and we do have great 
kids here -- think it's a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mishef says all absent students "have to return to school with an 
excuse," he concedes he does not have the manpower to check the validity of 
each one. So as long as the note appears plausible, students are off the hook. 
But five or more consecutive absences and a student has to "see me personally," 
Mishef says. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators across the Los Angeles Unified School District report similar 
senior ditch days, even though warnings against the practice were announced to 
students over the school's public address system. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Morrison, El Camino Real High School senior class sponsor, director of 
student activities and math teacher, says the tradition "has gone on for many, 
many years" at her Woodland Hills school. El Camino Real seniors had their 
ditch day June 1, the day before their prom. On Monday, when school resumed, an 
unusually long line wound its way into the attendance office with students 
holding handwritten excuses, some proclaiming near-death illnesses for their 
time off. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that no Southern California school district is immune to this 
senior-class custom. Ardis Bonozo, assistant principal at Santa Monica High 
School in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, says: "We 
experienced more absenteeism than usual" on the Friday before the senior prom, 
May 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard people talking about (ditching), talking about not showing up," 
Bonozo says. "We would like to see it not happen. The easy excuse is that, 
'Everyone is doing it' and so (seniors) join in and some parents say it's OK. 
You hear comments from teachers who planned important lessons for the day and 
no one was there, other teachers who planned exams and were disappointed" 
because the students didn't show. 
</P>
<P>
What's more important for parents and students to realize, she and other 
administrators contend, is that students 17 and younger who ditch are breaking 
the law. (Students 18 and older are not subject to compulsory attendance laws.) 
</P>
<P>
And, generally speaking, from the habitual truant to the occasional ditcher, 
students with unexcused absences are costing school districts money. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District alone, unexcused absences cost the 
district $110 to $120 million dollars this school year, says Joe Fandey, 
administrative consultant for the district's student attendance and adjustment 
services office. Fandey says the district receives $16.39 a day in tax dollars 
for every student who comes to school. The money is used for a variety of 
things, from paying teacher's salaries to building new schools and buying 
books, equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Fandey says his biggest worry is for students' safety. "When it becomes clear 
that there is a ditch day going on, that is cause for concern because the 
students' well-being becomes the overriding interest," he says. "But we never 
know until the roll is called and it becomes obvious that a ditch day is 
occurring." 
</P>
<P>
Ditch day at San Fernando High doesn't become officially unofficial until after 
the second period roll call when attendance records are filled in. 
</P>
<P>
But the word is out among students days before, according to senior Amy 
Sandoval, 17, who is in charge of decorating the school courtyard to kick off 
ditch day and prom night. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 a.m., about 50 San Fernando seniors start to transform trees and 
pillars into a forest of emerald green and black, the senior colors. 
</P>
<P>
Varsity cheerleader Ana Del Toro and Alma Avitia, a student government 
representative, both 18, hurriedly put the finishing touches on the last tree 
trunk, wrapping it in a green and black crepe paper braid. Liliana Curioca and 
Fernando Ortega, also 18, haphazardly toss leftover streamers into treetops, 
creating a ribbon effect that elicits oohs and aahs from passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, student body president Padilla and his best friend, Xavier Velazquez, 
17, join in the rush to string a senior-autographed banner between two trees. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:53 a.m. the school bell sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Maldonado, 18, senior class historian and yearbook photo editor, 
frantically works to capture the frenzied work of her classmates on film. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have 10 minutes to clear out, vanish and otherwise get lost," says 
Maldonado, who opts to join friends at a San Fernando hamburger joint. Then she 
leaves to get a haircut, pick up her prom dress, buy some makeup and rendezvous 
with her boyfriend, who attends Sylmar High and is also ditching school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teachers anticipate this day," Maldonado says. "A lot of us discuss it 
with parents. In a sense we're not really playing hooky. It's like we deserve 
the day off. I mean I was going to stay at school, but then I thought, 'Why?' 
when I could really use the day for my prom errands." 
</P>
<P>
Avitia, who plans to become an elementary teacher, has similar plans: a 
manicure, shopping, getting together with girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom knows," Avitia says. "She said 'Fine,' when I told her I wasn't going 
to school except to decorate it. She knows I have a lot to do before the prom, 
and I won't really have time to do it all on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
For Padilla; Ruben Moncada, 17; Velazquez and Greg Tan, 18, co-valedictorians 
with a grade point average of 4.0, the day's itinerary is packed with trips to 
familiar haunts and a new adventure at a funky Santa Monica shoe store. 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast at the hamburger joint, the students fan out to various 
locales. Those bound for Zuma Beach agree to meet at about 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
While they wait on friends who are running errands, Padilla and Velazquez, who 
have known each other since the fifth grade, talk about their futures, which 
are filled with promise. The two will travel to the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology to begin four-year study programs -- funded with scholarships, 
grants and student loans -- June 24. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to Zuma Beach is filled with pulsating, heart-pounding rap music: the 
cassette rhapsodies of BBD -- Bell, Biv, DeVoe -- Digital Underground, Public 
Enemy, Ice T, A Tribe Called Quest and Maestro Fresh Wes alternate with an AM 
radio station billed as the country's only 24-hour rap station. 
</P>
<P>
"The rap music we listen to promotes intelligence," Velazquez says as he and 
his pals engage in a rap session about rap music. "And intelligence is in. 
These rap groups aren't about money. They want to get their messages across, 
messages about your heritage, about being anti-gang, about thinking positively 
and promoting intelligence as the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Says Padilla: "Ignorance is out. To be intelligent is to be cool." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it means missing Mrs. Mildred Rubinstein's (secretly referred to as 
"Milli Vanilla" by students) fourth-period senior English class, which is what 
the the Zuma-bound seniors are doing. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading to lifeguard tower No. 6 -- where San Fernando High seniors have 
been gathering all day -- the four break into precision dancing, hours of 
practice and camaraderie evident. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Electric Slide," announces Tan, senior class sergeant-at-arms and 
varsity wrestling champ, while the quartet, who have removed trousers to reveal 
boxer trunks, line up, take three steps back, three steps forward, tilt, and 
repeat the routine to M.C. Hammer's "You Can't Touch This." 
</P>
<P>
"Now this is the Humpty," Velazquez says. He and his buddies bounce as their 
arms slowly reach toward the sky and then slowly drop to their sides. "The 
trick to this dance is to grab your shirt like this with one hand as your arm 
goes up," Velazquez says, while slowly pulling the front of his T-shirt up to 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
The impromptu dance demonstration concludes with a "Shouster thumb shake" -- 
the quick pressing together of two thumbs. Then it's straight to the sand. 
</P>
<P>
With beach towels, sun block lotion, boogie boards and tons of attitude, they 
join the dozens of seniors at Zuma 6 who have come to the beach on a day filled 
with talk about plans after graduation, philosophy about life, but, mostly, 
about cruising for chicks. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at Zuma 7, is a pack of students from Sylmar High in wet suits gabbing 
about the big one ("a monster wave, dude," explains a student with curly golden 
locks) that got away. Over by Zuma 4, sprawled on a Bartman towel -- named for 
TV's underachiever Bart Simpson -- are seniors from Polytechnic High in Sun 
Valley. And in the vicinity of Zuma 5, reports are wafting in that bikini-clad 
girls from Hollywood High are also playing hooky. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hernandez, his ankles deep into sand, is a 17-year-old peer counselor at 
San Fernando. The peer counseling experience has been an eye-opener, he says, 
and because of it, he'll attend Valley Community College and then, he hopes, 
UCLA to study psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are having all kinds of problems -- drugs, alcohol, relationships, 
families, school, money. Most of them are scared to move on. I'm scared to move 
on. There's so much sadness and fear, especially fear of graduating," Hernandez 
says, while the circle of guys around him listen with interest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," Padilla says later. "A lot of bad stuff is going on out there with 
people. But I have to believe that these are the best of times. Sometimes we've 
got to kick back and relax and not worry about stuff. That's what we did today 
and it was a blast. It ranks right up there. So we broke a rule, but the world 
went on whether we went to school or not."

NEIL C. SANDBERG'S TENURE WITH AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE SPANNED 40 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Mazel tov," Monsignor Royale Vadakin of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles said in his best Yiddish to Dr. Neil C. Sandberg upon his retirement 
after 40 years with the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Jewish Committee, a 
national human rights organization. For the last 28 years, Sandberg served as 
Western regional director. 
</P>
<P>
His retirement elicited all forms of congratulations and best wishes Monday 
night at a cocktail reception at the Beverly Hills Hotel preceding the 
organization's annual dinner meeting where Oregon governor Neil Goldschmidt 
spoke. Robert M. Jones, executive director of the Southern California Region 
National Conference of Christians and Jews, received the Dr. Max W. Bay 
Memorial Award. 
</P>
<P>
The list of leaders attending from religious groups and race relations 
organizations was a testimony to Sandberg's skill as a bridge builder between 
communities, as John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, put it. 
</P>
<P>
They included Bishop Oliver Garver of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles; 
Venerable Dr. H. Ratanasara, president of the Buddhist Sangha Council of 
Southern California; Dr. Fred Register, president of the Interreligious Council 
of Southern California; John Saito, executive director of the Japanese American 
Citizens League, and Rev. Spencer Gibbs, director of the Urban and Black 
Ministry of the United Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Los Angeles City Council members Joy Picus, Nate Holden, 
Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky; former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Dr. Julian 
Nava; Ran Ronen, consul general of Israel; Dr. Franz Cede, consul general of 
Austria, and Dr. Klaus Aurisch, deputy consul general of the Federal Republic 
of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil is, simply put, Mr. Human Relations of Los Angeles," suggested attorney 
Bruce Ramer. Sandberg, it turns out, isn't going too far when he retires. He is 
simply moving his office down the hall as director of the AJC's newly 
established Pacific Rim Institute. Sandberg said he'd be doing pretty much the 
same things he always did, only in another part of the world -- building 
bridges.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MEXICO FREE-TRADE PACT WOULD HELP U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the United States and Mexico have agreed to start talking about a free-trade 
agreement -- similar to the one negotiated a year and a half ago between the 
United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
So what? Such talks may be bold in concept, but do they really mean anything 
much to you? 
</P>
<P>
More than you may think. Mexico offers the United States an opportunity to 
create the world's largest market here in North America -- after two decades of 
feeling pressured economically by other nations or trading blocs, from OPEC to 
Japan's industrial machine to the European Community. A North American 
free-trade area, including Canada, would be larger in population and economic 
size than the 12-nation EC. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, fears of an isolated, threatened U.S. economy would evaporate; 
economically, an enlarged market would increase jobs and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
But any such grouping will face tremendous obstacles. In fact, whether the 
potential is ever realized may depend on how well we understand what the talks 
with Mexico are all about. 
</P>
<P>
They're about a potential market and industrial producer that could put Eastern 
Europe in the shade. Mexico, with a growing population of 88 million -- 40% 
under the age of 15 -- is a larger market for U.S. goods than all of Eastern 
Europe. And as a producer of goods, it could surpass South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
For some, that may raise a specter of low-cost imports and loss of American 
jobs -- Mexican workers make $2 an hour, compared to the U.S. average wage of 
$10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
But in Mexico's case, that perspective misses half the equation. When Mexico 
exports, it also imports; unlike many places in Asia and Europe, Mexico uses 
U.S. machinery to make its goods. Last year it bought more than $10 billion 
worth of U.S. machinery, computers and tools. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Mexico purchased $25 billion of U.S. exports and sent $27 billion 
northward as U.S. imports in 1989, as machinery, food, oil, motor vehicles and 
parts flowed in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
All three U.S. car makers manufacture in Mexico, for both the U.S. and Mexican 
markets. With 6 million cars for 88 million people -- compared to 185 million 
cars for 240 million Americans -- Mexico is one of the greatest potential car 
markets on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Still, potential has been there for years without fulfillment. In the 1970s, 
Mexico found new oil deposits and tried to take an industrial leap forward. But 
it over-borrowed, wasted money and fell back, buried under billions of dollars 
in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Even today's enthusiasm for free trade with the United States is due to 
desperation. Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari needs foreign 
investment. And U.S., European and Japanese investors aren't eager -- having 
lost too much in peso devaluations in the '80s. In any case, says a business 
leader in Japan, where Salinas visits next week, Japanese firms can get 
low-cost manufacturing elsewhere:"We have Mexicos closer to us, called Thailand 
and Singapore." 
</P>
<P>
So Salinas, the 41-year-old, Harvard-educated economist, must try to attract 
back some of the billions of dollars -- perhaps $100 billion, says one expert 
-- that wealthy Mexicans have sent abroad. "To do that he wants to tie the 
economy to the United States," says Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor 
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas will have to overcome opposition at home from those who say he is 
selling out Mexico to the United States, and from U.S. labor and some 
industries who see free trade only as cheap competition. And he'll have to 
overcome widespread skepticism among global business people and investors that 
Mexico can really get its act together. 
</P>
<P>
But Mexico may surprise the skeptics. Despite the reversals of the last decade, 
Mexico's economy is in better shape than Spain was 15 years ago when it began 
to modernize. Today, thanks to entry into the European Common Market, Spain has 
blossomed into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. 
</P>
<P>
With national income per person of $2,300 a year, Mexico today is entering 
another, higher stage of economic development, say experts. With help and 
orders from U.S. firms, Mexican companies are now beginning to make precision 
parts for computers and medical equipment. As they learn, Mexican companies 
will make -- and also use -- more complex equipment -- selling to and buying 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And as Mexico develops jobs and opportunities at home, fewer of its people will 
need or want to go north to pick crops or do menial jobs in U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, that vision may sound ideal. But there is an example to back it up in the 
U.S.-Canadian auto agreement of 1965, says Prof. Jose de la Torre of UCLA's 
Center for International Business. In that pact, the U.S. auto industry, the 
United Auto Workers union and the two governments agreed that certain car 
models could be manufactured in Canada and come duty-free into the U.S. market. 
In return, U.S. industry got to sell more goods to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a tremendous boon for Canada, lifting pay scales and living 
standards. But the agreement also expanded the Canadian market for U.S. goods, 
so that it remains by far the largest customer for U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
In international trade as in any other business, the moral is simple: You help 
others, you help yourself. That's why President Bush later this year will talk 
about free trade with President Salinas.

PROGRAM TRADING TRIGGERS LATE RALLY; DOW SOARS 40.85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices rose sharply Tuesday on computer-driven program buying that sent 
the Dow Jones industrials to within two points of their record highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow, up 30.19 Monday, gained 40.85 to 2,933.42, much of that in the final 
hour of trading. It was the second-highest closing in history, eclipsed only by 
the record 2,935.19 reached June 4. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2-to-1 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,003 up, 545 
down and 473 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 157.10 million shares, up from 
a two-month low of 119.55 million shares Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the rally to a bout of program trading, the computerized 
strategy of buying and selling large quantities of stocks and stock index 
futures to exploit price disparities in the two markets. They said buy programs 
kicked in automatically late in the day when futures prices substantially 
exceeded stock prices, making stocks an attractive buy. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the rise) caught everyone by surprise," one trader said. "There was no 
follow-through on the downside, so (stocks) turned right back up." Analysts 
also said large institutions were late buyers, as some began moving money from 
bonds into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people expected it to sell off, and when it firmed, that got 
people afraid they'd miss the rally and they hopped aboard," said Oppenheimer 
&amp; Co. market strategist Michael Metz. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the surge provided evidence that last week's drop in prices 
was just a temporary setback. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there are a lot of skeptics still on the fence, and the performance of 
the market has been dragging more of the skeptics into the market," said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Volume again was light, although analysts expect trading to pick up later in 
the week when the government releases reports on producer and consumer prices. 
"It looks like a market waiting for news or waiting for something to happen," 
said Robert Farrell, strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's advance was led by Procter &amp; Gamble, up 3 1/4 to 84 1/4; Merck, 
up 2 5/8 to 83 3/8, and 3M Co., up 2 to 85 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Oil service stocks saw significant buying. Halliburton rose 1 to 46 7/8, and 
Baker Hughes rose 1 to 28 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also flocked back to high-tech stocks. Sun Microsystems jumped 1 3/8 
to 33, Apple gained 1 1/2 to 40 1/2 and International Rectifier rose 1 1/4 to 
12. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana-based Tokos Medical rocketed 4 1/4 to 15 on news that it is buying a 
company in the same line of business as Tokos: monitoring devices for pregnant 
women who are at high risk of premature labor. Tokos will exchange 2.7 million 
of its shares for private Physiologic Diagnostic Service of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
New Line Cinema jumped 3/4 to 13 1/4 after declaring a 25% stock dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Other active stocks posting gains included General Electric, up 1 3/8 to 70 
1/4; Exxon, up 1 to 48 7/8; Coca Cola, up 7/8 to 45 3/8; IBM, up 3/8 to 120 
1/4; Westinghouse, up 3/8 to 37 7/8, and Philip Morris, up 7/8 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the yen's weakness discouraged stock market investors. The blue-chip 
Nikkei 225-share index lost 217.87 to close at 32,322.31. In London, prices 
closed higher but off their peaks for the day. The Financial Times 100-share 
index ended up 21.9 at 2,370.7. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index dropped 9.30 to 1,800.36, as investors 
continued to fret about pending German unification.

Bond Prices Dip in Sluggish Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were off slightly in another slow day on the bond market as 
investors awaited economic reports due out this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market's activity could be concentrated between Thursday morning 
and Friday morning," said Maria Ramirez, of Maria Ramirez Capital Consultant's 
Inc. in New York. She said most activity will be based on the producer price 
index for May due Thursday and the consumer price index for the same month to 
be released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face 
amount, while its yield rose to 8.45% from 8.44% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from Monday.

CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
British Pound Leaps to Four-Month High 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mixed against other key currencies, but the spotlight in 
foreign exchange was on a soaring British pound, which reached a four-month 
high against the U.S. currency in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said dollar trading was slow and in a narrow range before 
economic data scheduled for release later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the market's interest Tuesday was focused on a rush to buy sterling. 
The pound rose against other currencies and reached a four-month high against 
the dollar in Europe on reports that Britain plans full membership in the 
European Monetary System within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Treasury officials expect Britain's 
underlying inflation rate to be low enough toward year-end to include the pound 
in the monetary system. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling traded at $1.7020 in London, up from $1.6858 late Monday, and at 
$1.7035 in New York, up from $1.6860. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a 
closing 154.40 yen. It was quoted at 154.55 yen in New York, down from 154.77 
Monday.

Gasoline Futures Rebound Sharply

Gasoline for July delivery soared more than 2.6 cents a gallon on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, erasing steep losses registered during the three previous 
trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the rally reflected a bevy of minor influences, including 
jitters about the crippled oil supertanker Mega Borg off the Texas coast. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures were mixed, livestock 
futures fell and pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale gasoline futures settled 1.3 to 2.62 cents higher, with the contract 
for delivery in July up 2.62 cents at 58.5 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures finished 3 to 69 cents higher, with 
July at $17.51 a barrel; wholesale heating oil ended 0.60 cent to 1.66 cents 
higher, with July at 48.29 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts viewed the rally partly as a technical correction after a three-day 
decline in which the July gasoline contract fell a total of 2.48 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Buying by wholesalers and distributors in the cash gasoline market also 
contributed to the run-up, as did concerns about the burning supertanker in the 
Gulf of Mexico.

Bank Profits Recover in Quarter: Earnings at commercial banks bounced back to 
$6.2 billion in the first three months of 1990, despite spreading problems with 
real estate loans, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report. That 
was a big improvement over the preceding two quarters but still marked a 14% 
decline from a record $7.3-billion profit in first quarter 1989. Banks earned 
only $2.1 billion in fourth quarter 1989; that was revised down by $590 million 
from an earlier report after banks acknowledged more problem loans.

Studios Postpone Fin/Syn Talks: Hollywood studios asked the television networks 
with which they are negotiating to postpone the final round of their talks on 
financial interest and syndication rules. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission has set Thursday as the deadline for the 
sides to reach agreement. The networks and studios were supposed to meet 
Tuesday at Warner Bros. in Burbank, but Jack Valenti, president of the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America, said the studios needed more time to prepare their 
90-page filing with the FCC. The studios are expected to argue against the 
networks being allowed to enter the lucrative TV re-run business. Final 
negotiations are scheduled for 9 a.m. today. Chances of a settlement appear 
remote.

CENTURY 21 DROPS ITS L.A. AD AGENCY; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: MCCANN-ERICKSON LOSES THE $30-MILLION ACCOUNT TO A MINNEAPOLIS 
FIRM. THE MOVE IS A BLOW TO THE LOCAL INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In one of the biggest advertising deals this year, Century 21 Real Estate Corp. 
on Tuesday awarded its $30-million national account to Minneapolis-Advertising, 
dropping incumbent McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to split with the agency, which had the account for seven years, 
is a blow to the local advertising market because it pulls a trophy account and 
major piece of business out of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based Century 21's switch, which takes effect in 60 days, also 
underscores the tenuous relationships between ad agencies and real estate 
firms. As the real estate market has softened, several large real estate 
companies have switched agencies in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising is a high-visibility component of any business, and it often 
translates to problems (for the ad agency) when business takes a downturn," 
said Rich Edler, managing director of McCann-Erickson/L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate and BBDO/Los Angeles parted company in 
January after four years. Coldwell last month gave its $15-million national 
account to the Los Angeles office of Grey Advertising. And in April, Coldwell 
Banker Commercial switched its $5-million account to the Los Angeles office of 
Della Femina, McNamee WCRS after J. Walter Thompson/Los Angeles resigned from 
the account. 
</P>
<P>
Century 21, the nation's largest franchiser of real estate brokerage services, 
put its account up for grabs in March. The company said more than 100 agencies 
initially responded to its call for proposals and that seven agencies were 
invited to make creative presentations -- basically, to outline their proposed 
ad campaigns -- at its headquarters last week. 
</P>
<P>
McCann-Erickson/L.A. was one of the contenders, as was the firm's New York 
office. Two other Southern California firms, Chiat/Day/Mojo of Venice and 
D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles/L.A., also were finalists. 
</P>
<P>
A Century 21 spokesman said Tuesday that the company was not unhappy with 
McCann-Erickson's work but had put the account up for review in March because 
it wanted to see ideas offered by other firms. 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce Oseland, Century 21's senior vice president for marketing, said in 
March that when an account is put up for review "there generally is some level 
of concern about a particular aspect of the advertising." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
McCann Erickson's Edler said loss of the account would result in a staff 
reduction, but he could not say how many jobs would be lost. The firm employs 
120 in the Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
"From time to time," Edler said, "clients and agencies separate, and sometimes 
it is difficult to understand exactly why.

NBC FOLLOWS ABC WITH NEW AD POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping up pressure on advertisers, National Broadcasting Co. said Tuesday 
that it would follow competitor ABC's lead and institute a new policy on how it 
sets ad rates. 
</P>
<P>
The networks are abandoning the old method of how they guaranteed audience 
levels to advertisers because of what the networks claim are flaws in A. C. 
Nielsen Co.'s "people meter" national ratings system. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen has come under fire from ABC, CBS and NBC because television viewership 
declined sharply in the first quarter of the year and the ratings service has 
not been able to explain the falloff to the satisfaction of the networks. 
Nielsen maintains that it has inspected the system and can find nothing wrong 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
Although technically different from ABC's new policy, NBC nonetheless seeks the 
same thing: to limit its liability from the steep falloff in viewers as 
recorded by Nielsen earlier this year. The NBC decision will affect a big chunk 
of the projected $4.3 billion in advertising time to be sold in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the networks used the previous season's ratings for a show to set 
advertising rates for the upcoming year. Under the new system, NBC will use 
data from the previous six years, when available, to set the rates. 
</P>
<P>
All three networks are worried about the accuracy of the current Nielsen system 
they might have to give advertisers hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
free advertising time if ratings do not measure up to expectations. Only the 
fourth network, Fox, will guarantee the ratings of its shows based on the 
method used in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales for NBC, called the 
new policy an "interim solution" to the problem until a new measurement system 
could be devised. "We recognize there has been a trend in declining viewing, 
but what happened in the first quarter is larger than anything we've seen." 
Predictably, NBC's announcement was no more enthusiastically embraced by 
advertising agencies than ABC's decision had been the week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBC plan builds in some anticipated decline," said Betsy Frank, director 
of television and new media at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Inc. in New 
York. "But it's basically the same thing as ABC's." 
</P>
<P>
Frank and other advertising agency executives say they are satisfied with 
Nielsen's contention that the current "people meter" system is working 
properly. The agencies contend that the networks are using the current 
controversy to take the spotlight off their rapidly eroding market share. 
</P>
<P>
Despite agency protests, however, there appears to be little that the agencies 
can do. Network television is still the only medium that provides the broad 
reach required of major packaged goods companies, and the alternatives, such as 
cable or syndication, are not yet big enough to attract national-scale 
advertising dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But Hoffner acknowledged the confusion over new ad rates could extend the 
negotiations for the purchase of advertising time weeks beyond the customary 
July 4 wrap-up date. "It looks like a long summer," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is expected to announce its own ad rate policy by the end of the week.

Banks Optimistic About UAL Buyout: Banks are generally optimistic on financing 
a $4.4-billion employee buyout of UAL Corp., although the talks are in their 
initial stages, a spokesman for the buyout group said. Gerald Greenwald, the 
executive leading the buyout effort, has had talks with about six banks, said 
the spokesman for United Employee Acquisition Corp., the buyout group formed by 
UAL's three major unions. The group has until Aug. 9 to line up financing for

Delinquent Consumer Loans Drop: The American Bankers Assn. said a survey of 800 
banks showed a delinquency rate on consumer loans of 2.46%, down from 2.64% in 
the fourth quarter but slightly higher than the 2.39% rate a year earlier. The 
rate had hit a 10-year high of 2.88% in the third quarter of 1989. The 
delinquency rate includes seven types of closed-end consumer loans: personal, 
two types of auto loans, mobile home, recreational vehicle, property 
improvement and home equity.

<P>
STOCKS: AN NYSE STUDY GROUP BACKS AWAY FROM CONTROLS ON PROGRAM TRADING BUT 
URGES MORE TRADING HALTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York Stock Exchange study group Tuesday recommended increased use of 
trading halts to combat market volatility, but it backed away from urging 
controls on the computer-directed program trading that some have blamed for the 
market's dizzying slides. 
</P>
<P>
In a report commissioned after last October's market fall, a group headed by 
General Motors Chairman Roger B. Smith concluded that computer-directed trading 
isn't the primary cause of the turbulence -- and, moreover, isn't a great 
concern to average investors. 
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the best remedy for volatility is to provide more "time out" 
for investors during crises, to unify market regulation, to ensure greater 
liquidity for investors in turbulent markets and to better inform the public of 
the causes of market gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
The "circuit breaker" proposal would halt trading for one hour when the Dow 
Jones industrial index has moved up or down 100 points from the previous day's 
close. The proposal would close trading for 90 minutes when the move was 200 
points; for two hours when it was 300 points, and for four hours when it was 
400 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
The halts are intended to give investors time to assess their positions and 
decide what their next move should be. The Big Board already has "circuit 
breakers" in place that halt trading for one hour if the Dow moves 250 points 
and for two hours if the index moves 400 points. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which included members of the futures and stock industry, 
industrialists and academics, concluded that the public's fears have been 
fanned by misinformation by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
The report's conclusions are likely to be highly controversial among the "old 
guard" segments of the securities industry that sell stocks to individual 
clients and look with suspicion on the more recently developed, rapid-fire 
trading of large blocks of securities. Program trading was much criticized 
after the stock market's October, 1987, collapse, and again after last Oct. 13, 
when the Dow Jones index fell 190 points in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading's most common form is index arbitrage, in which traders sell 
huge baskets of stocks and stock index futures to profit from tiny price 
discrepancies between the markets. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen B. Timbers, who is chief investment officer of Kemper Financial 
Services and was a panel member, issued a statement saying Kemper "remained 
concerned" about the effects of index arbitrage and the high level of borrowing 
now permissible in the markets. Timbers said the firm supported the eight-point 
plan, however. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Metz, a market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. and longtime critic 
of program trading, said the report was "the most unimpressive piece of garbage 
I've seen in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we won't really address this problem until we have another 
disaster," Metz said, adding that he spoke for himself and not for his firm. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority on the panel felt they couldn't effectively ban program 
trading but rather could only, at most, force investors to execute such trades 
abroad, Smith said at a Big Board press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst that could happen would be to drive these trades out of the market," 
Smith said at a Big Board press conference. Such a move would in turn further 
shake the confidence of the small investor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In connection with the study, the Big Board undertook a study of individual 
investors' views that suggested minimal concern about program trading. 
</P>
<P>
About 53% of the direct shareholders whose opinions were sampled said they had 
never heard of program trading; 18% said the practice "should be controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who described themselves as "very concerned" about market trends 
and economic conditions, only 11% said they were very worried about program 
trading. Thirty-nine percent said they were worried about insider trading, 
while the largest category -- including 58% of respondents -- were worried 
about "the honesty and ethics of stock brokers." 
</P>
<P>
The study panel also recommended: 
</P>
<P>
* Improved systems to detect intermarket abuses, such as "front running." The 
term refers to the practice of using advance information on planned trades of 
others to profit in trades. 
</P>
<P>
* Entrusting to a single regulatory body the authority to set margins for 
securities, futures and options. 
</P>
<P>
* Development of new investments that would allow individual investors to 
protect themselves from market swings. 
</P>
<P>
* A campaign by the exchanges to work with the news media to better inform the 
public about the causes of volatility. 
</P>
<P>
* Changes to make it easier for corporations to buy back their stock in 
volatile markets. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations will be considered by the NYSE's board of directors, which 
in turn will propose changes to regulatory agencies and Congress. NYSE Chairman 
John J. Phelan said he believes the eight points have an "excellent" chance of 
implementation.

EUROPE'S REAL ESTATE INVESTORS FAVOR L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
European real estate investors and lenders consider Los Angeles and California 
as the most attractive city and state to invest in, according to a survey 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The preference and optimism about Los Angeles and California expressed by 
European firms were comparable to similar assessments by Japanese firms, which 
Mead Ventures Inc. surveyed on the same questions six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The European firms also said they did not expect events in Eastern Europe or 
the unification of the European Community in 1992 to have any effect on their 
activities in the United States, according to the survey by Mead Ventures. The 
Phoenix firm surveyed 115 American subsidiaries and branch offices of European 
real estate companies. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the interesting thing about these Europeans . . . they are designating 
Los Angeles as an international city of the first rank, like New York City, 
London or Paris. Whereas in the past, most Europeans and maybe most Americans, 
too, have maybe thought of Los Angeles as one rank below New York in 
international appeal, attractiveness and cachet," said Christopher Mead, 
president of the business information firm. 
</P>
<P>
While the European firms listed Los Angeles as the most attractive U.S. 
metropolitan area and California the most attractive state, the survey fell 
short of measuring their actual plans for the real estate investment activities 
in these specific areas. San Francisco ranked as the fifth most attractive U.S. 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. government tracks foreign investment by different countries 
(Britain is No. 1), it does not break out the data by type of investment or by 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the Europeans have a significant investment," said Jack Kyser, 
chief economist at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "We forget that 
Carnation is owned by Nestle, Baskin Robbins by Allied-Lyons PLC, and British 
firms also are active in the entertainment industry." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Volvo has a marketing and design facility in Camarillo and 
Volkswagen has a facility in Westlake Village. "Mercedes has an advance man 
scouting because they need one here, too," said Kyser. While he conceded the 
lack of specific data on European investment in the area, Kyser said the 
importance of Los Angeles to West Germany is seen in the trade flow. The Los 
Angeles Custom District shows trade with West Germany at more than $3 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Kyser said his office has been receiving an increasing number of calls from the 
local consulate offices and trade missions of European countries seeking 
economic information about Southern California. "Japanese activity has sort of 
fallen off; it's definitely European now." 
</P>
<P>
He believes that some European firms may be increasingly attracted to Los 
Angeles as a connecting point with countries in Asia. "The idea is you can do 
business with London, Paris or Berlin in the morning and in the late afternoon 
you can do business with Tokyo. It's a good halfway point."

SENATE TO BEGIN HEARINGS ON DIGITAL TAPE RECORDERS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTRONICS: A NEW BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE MACHINES TO CONTAIN A COPYRIGHT 
PROTECTION CIRCUIT TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM MAKING COPIES.

<P>
After four years of controversy over the adverse impact the technology might 
have on music sales, the Senate communications subcommittee today is scheduled 
to open hearings on a measure that is expected to pave the way for the 
introduction of digital audiotape recorders. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen record company officials, music publishers, manufacturers and 
songwriters are scheduled to testify on a bill that requires all DAT recorders 
sold in the U.S. to contain a special copyright protection circuit that would 
prevent consumers from making copies of their digital tape recordings. 
</P>
<P>
However, the coalition of record companies and equipment makers that had helped 
hammer out the compromise DAT measure introduced by Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.) is in danger of falling apart under pressure from disgruntled music 
publishers and songwriters. Rather than a copyright protection circuit, 
composers and publishers want a royalty on each blank digital audiotape sold to 
compensate them for potential lost sales due to home taping. 
</P>
<P>
"What we hope is that Congress will not act on this legislation," said Edward 
P. Murphy, president of the National Music Publishers Assn. "There is no 
consensus on DAT. There is only a great deal of confusion." 
</P>
<P>
"They are just being hard-headed and misinformed," said Thomas P. Friel, 
chairman of the Home Recording Rights Coalition and an executive at the 
Electronics Industries Assn., a trade group that represents equipment 
manufacturers. "We have a grand compromise here; it's a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sony, Technics, JVC and Denon announced last week that they plan to start 
shipping DAT machines with copyright protection circuitry as early as the end 
of this month. But some experts say that years of delay and political 
controversy over DAT may have dampened consumer interest in the machines. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that DAT will cause more than a ripple, but it won't be the 
revolution" for the music industry that compact discs have been, said Lionel S. 
Sobel, editor of the Entertainment Law Reporter in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Once hailed as a device that would usher in a new era in audio technology 
because of its superior sound recording capabilities, digital audiotape 
machines have been unable to generate critical record industry support. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential is there . . . but we've waited an awful long time for DAT and 
you just wonder if the buzz is not off," said Bob Buziak, president of RCA 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
Sony Classical is one of the few to offer prerecorded digital audiotape 
selections. By contrast, Bertelsmann Music Group -- parent company of the RCA 
and Arista labels -- says it doesn't believe there is a "viable mass market for 
DAT." Spokesman for Capitol and Elektra are similarly pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, DAT may soon face competition from newer digital technologies such 
as recordable compact discs and a new digital tape machine being developed by 
N.V. Philips that offers near-CD quality sound from standard audio cassettes.

SUPERVISORS WILL GIVE UP FOSTER HOMES LICENSING; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD WELFARE: STATE WAS EXPECTED TO REMOVE COUNTY AUTHORITY ANYWAY. LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL FIGHT TO ADMINISTER PLACEMENTS AND REST OF THE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors, convinced that the state intends to strip the 
county of its authority to license foster homes, voted Tuesday to voluntarily 
relinquish licensing responsibilities at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
However, local officials said that the county Children's Services Department 
would fight to administer foster care placements, along with the rest of the 
$300-million child welfare services program. 
</P>
<P>
The action marked the latest escalation of a tangled dispute between the county 
and the state Department of Social Services, the outcome of which will 
determine who decides the fate of 10,000 foster children and possibly 40,000 
other displaced children. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors said they were surprised and disappointed by the state's seizure 
Friday of county foster care records. The seizures came amid allegations that 
the department had failed to protect children by assigning them to foster homes 
with documented histories of molestation, abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
State administrators, who on Monday began reviewing the seized files, said the 
system may be more deeply fraught with problems than they previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen a number of the files -- about 15 -- and 10 of those are pretty 
bad," said Lawrence Bolton, assistant chief counsel for the Department of 
Social Services. "I'm hopeful that it won't be that high a percentage 
throughout." 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert Chaffee, director of county children's services, said most of 
the 15 cabinets full of files taken by the state were older cases that predate 
a computerized placement process instituted last June. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression all this would give is that something is radically wrong," 
Chaffee said. "My comment would be, 'No, nothing is radically wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
Only 10 California counties leave foster care licensing to the state, said 
Kathleen Norris, spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services. Most of 
them are smaller rural entities, such as Mono and Lake counties, which find 
that policing the system taxes their budgets and staff, she said. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. County supervisors said they decided to surrender licensing 
responsibilities in hopes of mollifying the state Legislature and the 
Department of Social Services. It was clear that the state was moving in that 
direction, they said. 
</P>
<P>
State legislators had added the licensing transfer to the proposed state budget 
after listening to a litany of allegations about foster care problems in Los 
Angeles during hearings last week in Sacramento. Witnesses told the lawmakers 
of a number of alleged atrocities, including sexual molestaton and beatings of 
children by foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to try to cooperate with the state to give them what they want . . . 
or we're going to be made the bad guy," said Supervisor Ed Edelman. "It is, I'm 
afraid, past the point of working it out." 
</P>
<P>
Loss of licensing responsibilities would mean 60 county workers would be 
transferred to other jobs. The county would be forced to forfeit $3.3 million 
in funds it receives from the state to oversee licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman and other supervisors peppered Chaffee with questions about county 
foster care, asking him whether any of the state's allegations could be true. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee acknowledged that with a 10,000-child caseload, "we do have some 
parents who do become abusive" in foster homes, but he turned the brunt of the 
blame back on the state, which he said is acting out of an unreasonable fear of 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton, the state attorney, said that defense misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is, sure we're concerned about liability -- we don't want to leave 
children with convicted abusers," he said. "But the liability isn't what's 
driving it, it's the safety of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the licensing transfer, the proposed state budget calls for a 
thorough review of all Los Angeles child welfare services programs, including 
placements in group homes and with relatives. If problems are documented and 
Los Angeles does not correct them, the state would move to take control of the 
entire program at the end of the year, affecting 40,000 children in addition to 
the 10,000 foster children.

SUPERVISORS HUDDLE ON ORDER TO REDRAW LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With their court-imposed deadline just 15 days away, four of the five Los 
Angeles County supervisors began private deliberations Tuesday over how to 
comply with a federal court order to redraw district boundaries to remedy 
discrimination against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum, whose district was at the center of 
litigation alleging the supervisors effectively have prevented election of a 
Latino candidate, was absent from the meeting. Other supervisors said Schabarum 
was fishing in Montana, and an aide to the supervisor said he was keeping in 
touch by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's whereabouts was one of the few revelations of the day, as 
supervisors and their most trusted staff huddled in their eighth-floor suites 
in the Hall of Administration. Sources among those present said that the 
supervisors dusted off old maps and talked about new ways to create a Latino 
district without destroying their own political bases, but few significant 
details leaked from the secret meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing you can quote me on is that Supervisor Edelman has no comment," 
said Joel Bellman, a spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon last week ruled that the five Anglo 
supervisors drew their district boundaries in 1981 in a way that dilutes the 
voting power of the county's 3 million Latinos. He gave supervisors until June 
27 to draft a new plan that would enhance the chances of the first Latino being 
elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have voted to appeal the case, which now has cost the county $4 
million and could cost another $2 million if the judge awards the plaintiffs 
attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
The four supervisors who met Tuesday were told that county counsel DeWitt 
Clinton later this week will hand-deliver to their offices a new redistricting 
plan that would comply with the court order. 
</P>
<P>
The map would consolidate heavily Latino neighborhoods in East Los Angeles and 
the San Gabriel Valley, now fragmented among three districts, into a single 
district, from which the first Latino would have an improved chance of winning 
a seat on the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
But the county counsel is expected to leave to the supervisors which of their 
colleagues is placed in the district, if anyone. Supervisors could still expand 
the board to provide a seat for a Latino without affecting an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters is Schabarum's decision not to seek reelection. Earlier 
this month, a crowded field competed for the seat, but none emerged with the 
majority needed for election. A runoff is scheduled to be held in November 
between the two top finishers, a former Schabarum aide and a Superior Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
The board on Tuesday delayed for three weeks -- until after Kenyon's deadline 
-- a vote on a proposal by Supervisor Kenneth Hahn to put a measure on the 
November ballot to expand the board to seven or nine members. County attorneys 
have said that the board could agree to expansion without a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
According to board sources, the board's conservative majority of Mike 
Antonovich, Deane Dana and Schabarum privately are drafting a plan that would 
place the liberal Edelman in a new Latino district. It involves drawing a 
finger that extends from the core of the district just east of downtown all the 
way to Edelman's home in Westwood so that the supervisor could run in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Such a proposal, however, could cause problems for the conservative Dana, who 
would be forced to pick up liberal Westside neighborhoods from Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
A county source said that Edelman is considering personally negotiating with 
the plaintiffs in the redistricting case. But an Edelman aide declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The other liberal on the board is Hahn, but his position seemed more secure. 
</P>
<P>
"What do we have to worry about?" a Hahn deputy asked. Hahn is safe because the 
supervisors cannot under the Voting Rights Act greatly juggle the boundaries of 
Hahn's heavily black district.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : NO LINK FOUND IN DEATHS, DUMPING OF 
CHEMICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no evidence to support allegations that toxic chemicals dumped at a 
Santa Clarita Valley defense plant led to five cancer deaths in a family that 
lived nearby, state health officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a new study, the state Department of Health Services said the deaths, which 
occurred between 1983 and 1989, may never be explained, but suggested that a 
genetic defect could have contributed to four of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The study examined the health history of the family of Diane and Robert 
Hercules, who moved to Sand Canyon from Culver City in 1979. The family lived 
less than a mile away from Space Ordnance Systems, an explosives maker 
convicted in 1986 of illegally dumping and storing hazardous chemicals.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : CITY FORMS DEPARTMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council Tuesday unanimously approved the establishment of 
a new Housing Preservation and Production Department to help cope with the 
city's housing affordability crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The new department, which will be advised by an Affordable Housing Commission 
appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley and City Council President John Ferraro, is 
expected to cost $10.8 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to come from federal grants and landlord fees and will not require 
cutbacks in other programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the staff will be transferred from the housing division of the 
Community Development Department, which has been the subject of complaints by 
Bradley and other city officials for poor administration of housing programs.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : 7 ARRESTED AFTER AIDS PROTEST TO SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest protest by AIDS activists targeting the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors, seven people were arrested Tuesday for disrupting the board's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators knelt in a front aisle as supervisors were beginning their 
meeting and, backed by about two dozen supporters, broke into a hymn in which 
they identified themselves as lesbians and gays "who are singing for our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested were Dave Johnson, AIDS coordinator for the city of Los 
Angeles, and three people dressed as members of the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors are debating the 1990-91 budget, which calls for no increases in 
the $60 million for AIDS services allocated last year. AIDS activists are 
demanding at least $9 million more. 
</P>
<P>
The seven protesters were arrested without incident.

DEPUTIES RESCUE KIDNAPED MAN, ARREST THREE SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An East Los Angeles businessman was kidnaped Tuesday and held for ransom in a 
South Gate garage, only to be rescued hours later by sheriff's deputies who 
arranged a phony ransom exchange with his abductors, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Abel Valenzuela, 52, was uninjured after the daylong ordeal during which he was 
handcuffed, blindfolded and held at gunpoint in the garage of a home in the 
10500 block of Jackson Avenue, Deputy Bill Linnemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Three men, Alfredo Garcia, 34, and brothers Crispin Mejia, 25, and Narciso 
Mejia, 23, were arrested and booked on charges of kidnaping for ransom, 
Linnemeyer said. They were each being held in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, owner of Abel Valenzuela Furniture on Whittier Boulevard in East 
Los Angeles, had been driving to work at 9:15 a.m. Tuesday when he was abducted 
about a block from his South San Gabriel home. 
</P>
<P>
Two men in a pickup truck cut Valenzuela off at an intersection, where one 
jumped out, pointed a gun at Valenzuela's head, and put the businessman in the 
back of the truck, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"Valenzuela's car was found in the middle of an intersection with the keys 
still in the ignition," Linnemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour later, Valenzuela's wife, Graciela, received a phone call in 
which the abductors "said they had kidnaped her husband and wanted $150,000 for 
his safe return," the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives then arranged a phony money drop in the parking lot of a store in 
South Gate near the intersection of the 710 Freeway and Firestone Boulevard, 
Sheriff's Sgt. T.J. Hageboeck said. 
</P>
<P>
About 4:30 p.m., an undercover deputy, pretending to be Valenzuela's daughter, 
drove to the designated drop-off point, where she met two of the alleged 
abductors. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and the older Mejia were arrested, and deputies traced the license plate 
of their car to the Jackson Avenue home where they found the third suspect and 
Valenzuela, Hageboeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the truck allegedly used in the kidnaping, deputies also found a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at the home, Linnemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the kidnaping apparently followed a failed business deal between 
Valenzuela and Garcia in which the two men were going to start a chain of 
stores.

COUNCIL OKS PROJECT SOUGHT BY FORMER YAROSLAVSKY AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

At the urging of Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the Los Angeles City Council on 
Tuesday authorized a nonprofit group represented by the husband of 
Yaroslavsky's longtime top aide to build housing over a city-owned parking lot 
in Sherman Oaks, sidestepping competitive bidding procedures. 
</P>
<P>
To comply with legal requirements, the council declared that awarding 
construction rights to the Jewish Federation Council was "in the public 
interest and necessity." 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish federation still must obtain a $6.25-million loan from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development to fund its 83-unit senior citizen 
housing project next to a bustling Ventura Boulevard retail strip that has 
recently become a favorite haunt of stylish youth, dubbed "the Melrose of the 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Representing the Jewish federation in its negotiations with the city has been 
Westside attorney Howard Katz, husband of Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief 
deputy. Katz said his maximum fee for developing this project -- as set by HUD 
-- would be $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a fraction of what I get paid by my other clients," Katz said. "This is 
not a windfall." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky could not be reached Tuesday to comment on Katz's involvement in 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Katz -- a former Yaroslavsky aide -- said it was immaterial that he had worked 
for Yaroslavsky and that his wife now works for the lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has not been ramrodded" by Yaroslavsky, Katz said. "I had to yell 
and scream to get it. . . . I didn't have the cooperation of the city, 
including Zev Yaroslavsky." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said competitive bidding for the right to build housing over city parking 
lots "takes too long" and "it becomes political." 
</P>
<P>
The motion to grant the Jewish federation the construction rights was 
introduced by Yaroslavsky on May 25. Yaroslavsky subsequently introduced 
another motion to amend the Sherman Oaks community plan for the project, change 
the site's zoning from parking to residential, and provide a 50% unit density 
bonus.

<P>
EXPENSES: CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE VOTES 2 TO 1 TO RECOMMEND PAYMENT OF $2,800 
BILL FOR CHARTER FLIGHT. THE ACTION IS OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF CITY CONTROLLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Over the objections of City Controller Rick Tuttle, a key City Council 
committee on Tuesday narrowly approved payment of controversial $2,800 
round-trip charter jet flight to Sacramento taken by Department of Water and 
Power General Manager Norm Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the expense "exorbitance that rises to the level of unlawful," Tuttle 
said he will urge the full City Council later this month to ignore the 
committee recommendation and force Nichols to pay for the flight himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The council should rule it to be unlawful and the city should not pay for that 
travel and Mr. Nichols should," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said his schedule was too tight on April 24 to take regularly scheduled 
commercial airlines for a 45-minute meeting in Sacramento with California 
Department of Energy officials. Although the Sacramento meeting was arranged 
weeks in advance and the charter flight booked 12 days ahead of time, Nichols 
told the committee, "we attempted to adjust staff and calendar" but could not 
free up enough time to take available commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee approved payment of the charge on a 2-1 vote, the 
council members clearly did not approve of Nichols' actions. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the Commerce, Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, said, "This kind of expense and conduct is not 
acceptable." She said she would not consider paying for similar expenses in the 
future. But, Flores said, she recommended payment of the bill because the DWP's 
expense policy was not clear cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel the flight was justifiable," Flores said, "but it may not have 
occurred to you that it was not acceptable. . . . I believe that you didn't and 
your staff didn't give enough importance to the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle, who as city controller oversees all city expenditures, said he believes 
that city expense policy is explicit. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle cited a 1980 report by the city attorney that found that among the few 
expenses that would be unacceptable on their face would be renting 
"presidential suites" and "charter plane flights." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who voted against paying for Nichols' chartered 
flight, said: "I agree with Tuttle. There is a policy and it is clear. They 
should have been able to adjust their schedules." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle and Nichols have differed on expense account charges before. In the 
past, Tuttle has refused to pay for high-cost luncheons for DWP staff, 
including one event at a private club. Flores suggested that Nichols "begin 
treating the city money as if it was your own," saying that might stop such 
expensive practices.

A study of drug abuse among San Jose State athletes led to the firing of 
football Coach Claude Gilbert and uncovered problems among players in other 
sports, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A confidential report, prepared by Heitzinger and Associates and sent to 
then-athletic director Randy Hoffman Oct. 5, 1988, became public this week. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hoffman, the report warned that football players had admitted 
taking amphetamines before games. It also said three players admitted using 
steroids.

IT'S A GUARDING PARTY FOR DETROIT TRIO; 
</P>
<P>
PISTONS: THOMAS TAKES OVER IN KEY THIRD-QUARTER RUN, DUMARS PLAYS WELL DESPITE 
HIS FATHER'S DEATH AND JOHNSON FINALLY HEATS UP OFF THE BENCH AS TRAIL BLAZERS 
ARE SHOT DOWN.

The Palace guards held their ground again, this time away from home and under 
the most difficult of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The backcourt of Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Vinnie Johnson went for 32, 26 
and 20 points, respectively in the Detroit Pistons' 112-109 victory Tuesday 
night. Thomas strolled into another one of those shooting zones that helped him 
erupt for 33 in Game 1 at the Palace of Auburn Hills. After scoring two and two 
in the first two games in these NBA finals, Johnson came off the bench with his 
second solid performance. Dumars, carrying the biggest load of all, the death 
of his father, played as if without any heavy burden. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, everyone moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
No one had more concerns coming in than Dumars, greeted by the Portland 
Memorial Coliseum crowd with supportive applause during introductions of the 
starting lineups. He had originally planned to go home to Detroit for the 
services of his father, namesake and hero, but family in Louisiana postponed 
that until Saturday, part of a two-day break in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars' performance, however, made it a very real possibility that the series 
might not last beyond Thursday night. Shaking off a one-of-six first quarter, 
when the Pistons hit just 36%, he went eight of 15 the last three periods. In 
the final five minutes of a close game, he made six free throws without a miss. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't surprise me," Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman said. "That's just the 
way he is -- such a class person. Maybe it was a good outlet for him." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was important to get this first game behind him. A relief, if 
nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think so," said Piston General Manager Jack McCloskey, who has stayed close 
to Dumars since Sunday. "That was pretty evident." 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, staying clear of the media, didn't need to say anything afterward to 
prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"He accomplished something," McCloskey said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, fast making the series MVP balloting a non-question, had a showing 
reminiscent of Game 1 back home, No, a show more than a showing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Twenty-two points in the third quarter, connecting on eight of 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four consecutive three-point baskets, the last of which gave the Pistons a 
16-point lead, 81-65, with 2:17 to play in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixteen consecutive Detroit points, going from a baseline left jumper to 
three-point bomb to rebounding his own miss for a layin to a pair of 
straight-away three-pointers to another from the right corner. It was like he 
was playing around the world by himself. Or H-O-R-S-E. Or M-V-P, and no one 
else got a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt real good," said Thomas, limited to only three shots and 10 minutes 
the first two quarters after picking up three fouls. "I felt in the first half 
that I was shooting well, and then I got in the early foul trouble. As I sat 
there, I sensed we could take advantage of them, really take control. More or 
less knock the emotion out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I hit a couple shots, I felt like I could make them from anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
In the scheme of the Piston offense, when four players funnel the ball to the 
hot shooter, that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of pressure, because it is not something I like to do all the 
time. But you have to be man enough to shoulder the blame. . . . It gets tough 
sometime, but we've got some great guys on this team and when things don't go 
right they understand." 
</P>
<P>
No need to find a sympathetic soul. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe this was the same Vinnie Johnson who struggled to reach awful 
earlier in the series. Even after going nine of 13 in Game 3, his percentage in 
the finals was still 43.5% at the start of play Tuesday. For a player whose 
solitary role is to score off the bench, this was known as trouble. 
</P>
<P>
From this came a nine-for-12 night. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the three best guards in the league, period," said John Salley, a 
forward. "That's why it's a guard-oriented offense. When they get rolling, 
there's no stopping us."

BUCKS' HARRIS: DUNLEAVY IS UP TO THE JOB

<TEXT>
<P>
Del Harris, coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, said Tuesday that Mike Dunleavy, his 
former assistant who was named Laker coach Monday, is ready for the job despite 
his lack of NBA head coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is a bright guy, and I gave him a lot of freedom of expression here," 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been associated with him since 1977, when he was a player and assistant 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He will develop -- and has (developed) -- his own ideas as well as assimilate 
the things he learned from Nellie (Don Nelson) and me and from playing. He's 
willing to take responsibility. He will allow players to play, but when the 
tough decision time comes, he's not afraid to take the ball in his own hands. 
As a player, he was not afraid to take the last shot, and as a coach, he can 
make the tough call." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that this season Dunleavy alternated setting the Bucks' game plans 
with Frank Hamblen, the Bucks' top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're dealing with a special guy," Harris said of Dunleavy. "He's a 
bright and astute person. It's a tough task with the Lakers, but he is equal to 
the challenge." SAM McMANIS

RYAN'S ONLY NL NO-HITTER SUMMED UP BY FINAL OUT

Nolan Ryan has since departed Houston, but at least one prominent member of the 
Astros will cherish what Ryan left behind -- the memories of the pitcher's only 
National League no-hitter, a 5-0 victory over the Dodgers on Sept. 26, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I only caught one ground ball that day, but it was the last one," recalled Art 
Howe, the Houston manager who was the Astros' third baseman then. "I remember 
Dusty Baker coming to the plate and he was a pull hitter and I knew, if there 
was going to be a ground ball, I was going to get it. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided that whatever happened, I would get squarely in front of the ball, 
so if I booted it, there would be no question that it was an error," Howe said. 
"Then when I caught the ball, I wanted to get rid of it as fast as I could. It 
was like a hot potato." 
</P>
<P>
He made the throw to first base, and the final out was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard it so loud," said Mike Scioscia, who was catching. "The 
Astrodome was so loud, it was shaking. I couldn't even hear myself think." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia, who watched Houston fielders catch four hard line drives to right 
field in the Astros' 5-4 victory Tuesday, said those plays reminded him of that 
1981 day. 
</P>
<P>
"In my last at-bat against Nolan, I remember hitting the ball to right-center 
field, and I thought, 'This is it, it's in the gap.' " Scioscia recalled. "But 
no, it was caught. And I never got another chance." 
</P>
<P>
Those who were involved in that game agree that not much about Ryan has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"He still grunts when he pitches," Astro reliever Dave Smith said, "which I 
could never figure out because usually when you grunt, that means you're 
overthrowing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Howe: "And you still know, if that curveball is working in the first 
inning and he doesn't throw it in the dirt, he has a chance at a no-hitter."

BAVASI STILL TAKES THE HEAT FOR LETTING RYAN GET AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buzzie Bavasi, the man who let Nolan Ryan get away from the Angels, sent him a 
note Tuesday in the wake of the pitcher's record sixth no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
It read: "Nolan, some time ago, I made it public that I made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi, then the Angels' general manager, allowed Ryan to become a free agent 
in 1979 after the two failed to agree on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I could live with the salary his agent, Dick Moss, was asking," Bavasi said 
Tuesday from La Jolla, where he is living in retirement. "It was the other 
things I couldn't live with. There were incentive things like innings pitched. 
Things not based on performance. Things that many players could have 
accomplished. If we had given it to him, it would have opened up a real 
Pandora's box. 
</P>
<P>
"But although I'm writing to Nolan tongue in cheek, I want to make sure he 
knows I was responsible (for Ryan leaving), not (owner) Gene Autry. A mistake 
was made, but I was the one who made it. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought Sandy Koufax was the best I ever saw. But I've got to put 
Nolan Ryan right next to him. He's a remarkable young man." 
</P>
<P>
That's not what Bavasi was saying 11 years ago when Ryan took his fastball to 
Houston. Ryan was coming off a 16-14 season with the Angels. Asked how he would 
replace the right-hander, Bavasi replied: "You mean, where can I find two 8-7 
pitchers?" 
</P>
<P>
He found several of those. But somehow, it just wasn't the same.

Cal Ripken Jr. has the second-longest playing streak in major league baseball, 
yet the Baltimore Orioles' shortstop has received as much criticism as acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken played in his 1,308th consecutive game Tuesday night at Baltimore in a 
game in which Randy Milligan hit his 10th home run leading off the 10th inning 
to give the Orioles a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who trailed most of the game, tied it, 3-3, on Mickey Tettleton's 
home run with two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken passed Everett Scott for the No. 2 spot in longevity behind Lou Gehrig. 
Ripken is 822 games -- or more than five seasons -- way from Gehrig's record of 
2,130. 
</P>
<P>
But many believe Ripken should not even try to break the record. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore fans claim Ripken has looked lethargic and even weary lately. He was 
0 for 4 against the Brewers and is batting only .163 since May 18 (14 for 86). 
</P>
<P>
When asked about it, Ripken said, "The only thing I'm tired about is hearing so 
many people asking me if I'm tired. I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, who went into a slump late last season, is batting only .213 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what I've done," Ripken said, "but there isn't any big special 
feeling. I don't mean to downplay it, but it really is just another game. 
Maybe, if by some stroke of luck I catch Gehrig, then that will really be 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, who will be 30 in August, would be 35 if he plays every game until he 
reaches Gehrig's record. 
</P>
<P>
His streak began after a day off following sitting out the second game of a 
doubleheader on May 29, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any idea this would happen," he said. "It wasn't something I set 
out to do. It's something I never consciously said I was going to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief, in a way. But I never did understand the meaning of the streak 
and all the attention that has been poured into it." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken may not be impressed, but his peers certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," the Brewers' Paul Molitor said. "He can take a foul ball off 
the foot or get hit by a pitch, but he's still climbing Mt. Everest. He's 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Oakland 5 -- Dennis Eckersley failed in relief for the first time in 
21 tries. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley, who has 20 saves, was brought in with the Athletics leading, 5-2, in 
the ninth inning at Oakland. An error by shortstop Walter Weiss started the 
Rangers' rally, and Eckersley, who issued his first two walks of the season, 
gave up three hits. 
</P>
<P>
Of little solace was Rickey Henderson becoming only the second player to reach 
900 steals. Henderson stole second and third bases in the first inning to reach 
the goal. Jose Canseco was released from the hospital, where he has been 
treated for back problems, but he will not accompany the team to Chicago after 
today's game. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Minnesota 4 -- A three-base error by Twin second baseman Fred 
Manrique allowed Toronto to score two unearned runs in the seventh inning at 
Minneapolis and put the Blue Jays into first place in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth loss in a row for the Twins after their 21-7 record was the 
best May in their history. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins led, 4-3, when Mookie Wilson singled with one out in the seventh 
inning. John Candelaria relieved Kevin Tapani and got Junior Felix to hit a 
potential double play ball, but the ball rolled through Manrique and gave 
Toronto its winning runs. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Boston 4 -- Steve Balboni's run scoring, pinch-hit pinch-hit single 
snapped an eighth inning tie at New York and the Yankees knocked the Red Sox 
out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti got the last three outs for his 12th save this season and the 
200th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game the Yankees learned that pitcher Pascual Perez, who has made 
only three starts since signing a three-year $5.7 million contract, may require 
shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 7, Detroit 3 -- Chris James hit a three-run home run and Sandy Alomar 
had three hits at Detroit to lead the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Black (5-3) gave up seven hits and walked three, but pitched his second 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
James capped a four-run third inning with his fourth home run of the season and 
the Indians were never headed. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lindeman, making his first start for the Tigers, homered and drove in all 
three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Johnson helped spoil the White Sox hopes of 
moving to within a game of Oakland in this game at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson (6-3) won his third in a row, giving up three hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
Buhner hit his fifth home run this month. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, who had won four in a row, are two games behind Oakland in the 
West.

<P>
Dan O'Brien set a world best in the decathlon long jump Tuesday and took the 
lead in the Mobil Outdoor Track and Field Championships at Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, 23, of Portland, Ore., completed the first five events of the 
demanding 10-event competition with 4,656 points. The previous first-day best 
by an American was 4,526, set by 1968 Olympic gold medalist Bill Toomey at the 
Mexico City Games. 
</P>
<P>
Toomey's total, however, will stand as the American record, because O'Brien's 
performance was wind-aided. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Dave Johnson and Sheldon Blockburger, are tied for second 
with 4,359 points. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a little beyond my expectations," O'Brien said. "I always thought I 
had the ability to put it together. Now I'm doing it." 
</P>
<P>
In the long jump, O'Brien went 26 feet 4 1/2 inches on his third jump , 
breaking the mark of 26-3 set by Mike Herman in the 1960 national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the record jump, O'Brien had the fastest time in the 100 meters, a 
wind-aided 10.40 seconds; a 50-4 3/4 shotput, second-best in the 16-man field; 
a 6-11 3/4 high jump, matching the top performance; and a 49.25 for 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
In the heptathlon, Cindy Greiner, a two-time Olympian making a comeback at 33, 
led by nearly 100 points with 3,763 points after the 100-meter high hurdles, 
shotput, high jump and 200-meter run. 
</P>
<P>
Kym Carter was second with 3,666 points and NCAA champion Gea Johnson of 
Arizona State was third with 3,659. 
</P>
<P>
Today's final events in the heptathlon will be the long jump, javelin and 800 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
Track and Field Notes 
</P>
<P>
Among the bigger names to commit to specific events Tuesday were Carl Lewis, 
who will run in the 100 meters qualifying heats Thursday; Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
in the long jump and shotput (but not the heptathlon, in which she holds the 
world record), and Mary Decker Slaney in the 1,500 meters Friday. Athletes may 
make general entries but must indicate three days before competition the 
specific events in which they will compete. . . . Steve Scott of Upland and 
formerly UC Irvine, will attempt to become the winningest active TAC competitor 
when he tries for his seventh title in the 1,500. . . . Among the top U.S. 
career records are George Gray's 10 titles in the shotput in the 1880s, Maren 
Seidler's 11 women's shotput titles in the 1960s and '70s; Dorothy Dodson's 11 
straight javelin titles from 1939 to 1949, and current star Evelyn Ashford's 
five titles each in the 100 and 200 meters. Ashford will compete in only the 
100 this week.

SOUL &amp; EGO: When the $17.6-million Irvine Theatre (F1) opens in October, 
the city will finally have "a soul," says Mayor-elect Sally Anne Sheridan. . . 
. The 750-seat theater will also have a new name -- the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
-- in honor of Richard H. and Marjorie Barclay of Newport Beach, who pledged $1 
million to help complete construction. Barclay, a Southern California 
developer, concedes there is "probably a little ego" in his donation. Mark I.

OLYMPIC GRANTS ELUDE NEEDIER AREAS IN O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: THE SURPLUS FROM THE GAMES SO FAR HAS GONE TO TWO AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES 
-- LAGUNA NIGUEL AND NEWPORT BEACH -- FOR A DIVING PLATFORM AND BOATS.

<P>
The 1984 Summer Olympics left a rich legacy: $90 million in profit to be used 
for amateur youth sports in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But of the $30 million distributed so far, Orange County-based programs have 
received about 1% -- and nearly half of that went to buy a diving platform for 
a Laguna Niguel swimming pool and boats for a private Newport Beach rowing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines of the nonprofit, tax-exempt Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los 
Angeles, which distributes the Olympic largess, stress that "special emphasis" 
be given to "groups or communities that are most in need. These will often be 
communities of lower income." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the programs in Newport Beach and Laguna Niguel, two of Southern 
California's most well-to-do communities, received $165,000 of the $336,000 
given to Orange County organizations since the grant program began five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, needy amateur sports groups in Orange County, which hosted four 1984 
Olympic events, suffer from shortages of equipment, inadequate facilities and 
bank accounts in the red. Many of these groups apparently have been unaware 
that there is money available for the asking. Ironically, some may not qualify 
under AAF guidelines simply because they are too needy. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, successful foundation grantsmanship may not hinge entirely on need. 
Connections seem to help. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
The private Newport Aquatic Center, where lessons cost $50 and it costs $250 a 
year to join, received a $115,000 grant in December, 1986, to buy 15 racing 
shells. Among the center's board of directors when it applied for the money 
were two former U.S. Olympic rowers -- Bruce Ibbetson and Curt Fleming -- and 
an ex-Olympic rowing coach -- David Grant. Ibbetson wrote the application for 
the grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact we were all on the Olympic team didn't hurt," conceded Grant, 
longtime Orange Coast College crew coach who last month was named the community 
college's president. 
</P>
<P>
The Crown Valley Recreation Center in Laguna Niguel was awarded $50,000 in 
October, 1989, to buy a diving platform and a water bubbler that will benefit a 
competitive diving team that practices at the public pool. The grant 
application was written by Dick Wilson, who was competition director for diving 
at the 1984 Summer Olympics and also the official announcer at those Olympic 
events. Wilson said his Olympics involvement made him aware of the grant 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I'm aware of what the grant will do, that gave me an edge," 
Wilson said. "I did the (application) up right . . . to show how there was such 
a need." 
</P>
<P>
For example, without the expensive new diving platform, Wilson pointed out, the 
Crown Valley Divers would have to travel to Mission Viejo or Irvine to practice 
on a diving platform. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a long drive," said Wilson, whose wife, Ida, is the Crown Valley 
Divers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
The AAF says it considers grants for "any bona fide organization devoted to 
amateur sport," adding that its money is "aimed primarily to youth who are not 
at elite levels of sport accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, foundation officials concede that there is some advantage for 
applicants who have been affiliated with the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I would assume people affiliated with the Olympics would get first choice," 
foundation chairman David Wolper said. "If somebody was an Olympic coach, he 
would be very high on our listing and should be." 
</P>
<P>
At stake is a seemingly endless supply of Olympic profits. By investing its 
money, the AAF has been able to give away and spend about $30 million just by 
drawing on interest and without touching the original $90 million allotted for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, demand for the money has been less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been overwhelmed with requests for money," said Los Angeles 
attorney John C. Argue, a member of the AAF board of directors who sits on the 
foundation's Grants Committee. One estimate has the AAF approving perhaps as 
many as 80% of the applications it receives. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to put it into areas that need it the most. It's one of our primary 
goals," Argue said. "What we're trying to do is put balls and bats in the hands 
of kids." 
</P>
<P>
June Canham would like that. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly could use it," said Canham, volunteer treasurer of the Southeast 
Santa Ana Little League, which serves children in one of the poorest 
neighborhoods of Orange County's most impoverished city. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Southeast Santa Ana Little League ran into financial 
difficulties. Children did not get their trophies because there was no money. 
There was a shortage of uniforms, so neighboring Little Leagues donated some. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the league had to raise sign-up fees from $30 to $35 per child. The 
league remains about $17,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Canham estimates that there would be at least twice the 200 youngsters ages 5 
to 14 who participate in the program if they could afford to join. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing our utmost to keep the children off the streets," Canham said. 
There are no other organized sports programs serving the youth of the 
high-crime, low-income neighborhood around Standard Street and Edinger Avenue, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Southeast Santa Ana Little League may be too impoverished to qualify 
for an AAF grant. The foundation's criteria discourage grants to pay off debts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say (that they are) $20,000 in debt and would like a grant to get 
. . . solvent -- we do not do that," said Judith Pinero, AAF's vice president 
in charge of grants. "We want to fund programs that . . . have had some degree 
of self-sufficiency. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to provide funding without interest or repayment to organizations 
that run quality sports programs and we're here to help them enhance what they 
are already doing well." 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Santa Ana Little League's current board of directors inherited 
the budget deficit, according to Robert Jackson, Little League District 30 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was ready to shut down the league until Canham and other volunteers 
came forward last year. 
</P>
<P>
Canham, who took over management of the finances, only recently learned of the 
Olympic grant program when advised by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of leagues probably don't know anything about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the AAF's Pinero conceded that despite widespread publicity and 
promotion of the grants, "there are a lot of people who don't know about us. . 
. . We are constantly trying to get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
"When we have money," Argue said, "you'd assume that a lot of people would like 
to have some of it. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) people need to apply to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Argue maintains that a "lack of infrastructure" to encourage communication 
between leaders of many youth sports is what makes it difficult for local 
groups to obtain grants. As a result, the AAF has resorted to "creating our own 
programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have formed sports clubs in public housing areas and get the people 
involved" in East Los Angeles and South Central Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County since the 1984 Olympics, the AAF has awarded direct grants to 
17 locally based groups, such as $3,500 to Tustin Pony Baseball and $67,400 to 
the Huntington Valley Boys and Girls Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think quite a substantial amount of money has gone out there," Argue said. 
</P>
<P>
But a much greater percentage of the grants has gone to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tendency to give more money where more events were held," Argue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
(During the '84 Games, Orange County hosted Olympic team handball at Cal State 
Fullerton, wrestling at the Anaheim Convention Center, cycling on the streets 
of Mission Viejo, and the pentathlon at Coto de Caza and Irvine.) 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's announced intention is to serve the "same broad cross-section 
that contributed so much to the success of the 1984 Olympics."

"Take a baseball team in East L.A.," Argue said. "If we buy bats and balls and 
uniforms, then it means that the neighborhood doesn't have to, so they don't 
have to charge anybody anything to play." 
</P>
<P>
That scenario sounds wonderful to Tim Bradley, a father of seven who volunteers 
to help run the Tri-Cities football program in Buena Park, La Palma and 
Cypress. Bradley also was unaware of the AAF grants. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids we seem to attract are from the lower-income areas -- mostly Buena 
Park," Bradley said. "Their parents really can't afford our fees." 
</P>
<P>
Although registration is $75, it totals about $240 per child for equipment, 
insurance and other costs, Bradley said. The balance must be obtained through 
fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to run about 20%, but now we're up to about 40%" of parents unable to 
pay registration, he said. "It just seems like every year it gets to be a 
higher and higher" percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"Our home field is around an area that is not very good, and it seems like we 
get a lot of those kids. We try to take them off the street." 
</P>
<P>
What are the options for youngsters who can't afford to sign up? 
</P>
<P>
"Stand around and get shot," Bradley said. "Right next to our field, we had two 
people get shot by drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
Some Orange County organizations have been aware of the AAF grants, but the 
grant applications were turned down, Pinero said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, there was a request from the Anaheim Parks and Recreation Community 
Services Department to fund "a recreation and socialization program for the 
physically disabled and head-injured adult population." 
</P>
<P>
Pinero said the application was rejected because the AAF does not give money to 
governmental agencies or fund programs for adults. 
</P>
<P>
Were the AAF to fund public agencies, Pinero said, "city councils and the 
powers that be would just say: 'Hey, the foundation will do it, why should we 
do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
The AAF may frown on giving money directly to public entities, but the 
foundation has given sizable grants to a private foundation that uses the money 
to provide a service to Los Angeles public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Rights Foundation has used its AAF money to conduct a Sports 
and the Law Workshop for Los Angeles Unified School District teachers who 
integrate it into their eighth-to-11th grade curriculum, Pinero said. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation provides the workshops and curriculum because the school 
district won't pay for it, Pinero said. 
</P>
<P>
AAF officials say that Orange County also benefits from grants to agencies that 
transcend geographic boundaries, such as about $230,000 contributed to the 
National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis and $61,000 to the California Amateur 
Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the largest grant to an individual program based in Orange County has 
been the $115,000 to the Newport Aquatic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Every three months, new grants are announced. About $300,000 will be awarded 
Friday, but there are no Orange County groups being considered, Pinero said. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, however, Orange County might be in line for some more Olympic 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Both Grant from the Newport Aquatic Center and Wilson from Crown Valley Divers 
say they probably will ask for more money. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to go back to the Amateur Athletic Foundation for more equipment and 
more support," Grant said. "It seems like you can't do anything for less than 
$100,000." 
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't rowing be as exciting as football in high school?" Grant asked. 
"Why should rowing have to have the bake sales? Why should these sports 
struggle like this? We clearly need some help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

$90 million in profits to be used for amateur youth sports in Southern 
California, Orange County groups have been left out in the cold. They've 
received only 1% of the $30 million distributed so far, and nearly half of that 
went to buy a diving platform for a Laguna Niguel pool, shown at left, and 
boats for a private Newport Beach rowing program. Ironically, some groups may 
not qualify because they are too needy. At left, Arika Earley, 13, of Mission

'VERY MINOR' OIL SPILL HITS THE BEACH AT BOLSA CHICA; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: OFFSHORE RIGS ARE SUSPECTED, BUT THE SOURCE IS UNCERTAIN. CLEANUP 
BEGINS ON FOULED STRETCH OVER A MILE LONG.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 168 gallons of oil fouled more than a mile of Bolsa Chica State Beach 
early Tuesday evening and investigators said leaking offshore oil rigs may be 
the source of the spill, U.S. Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lt. Vincent Campos said an emergency cleanup crew hired by Unocal, 
which operates three offshore oil platforms in the area, was dispatched to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very minor spill," Campos said. "We don't have anything from Fish and 
Game yet, but it may have involved a couple of birds." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica is located just north of the main stretch of Huntington Beach that 
was soiled when almost 400,000 gallons of crude oil spewed from the crippled 
tanker American Trader 1.3 miles offshore in February. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's spill was minor by comparison, it was enough to leave a mile 
and a quarter of the state beach covered with small patches of oil. Petty 
Officer Lindsay Dew said the heaviest patch was an eighth of a mile long, in 
some sections 12 to 15 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
Several Coast Guard officials estimated the total amount of oil spilled at four 
barrels, or 168 gallons, which they said can easily spread over large areas of 
ocean in a thin film. By late Tuesday, officials stressed the spill appeared to 
be minor. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no animal life being affected," said Dew. "The oil has all washed 
up on shore. We don't believe there's any left in the water." 
</P>
<P>
State and federal wildlife officials were not immediately available for 
comment, but officials at the scene said only one duck had been found covered 
in oil. However, the grunion were supposed to run overnight and they too could 
be affected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game also dispatched a team to take 
samples of the sand and to observe wildlife in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the source of the spill was not yet determined, Unocal decided to take 
responsibility for the cleanup. Company spokesman Barry Lane said the firm's 
emergency crews would work with shovels to remove the contaminated sand by the 
sackful. He said the company took on the job because "We operate in that area 
and we have people there." 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard spokesman said a 20-person cleanup crew from Long Beach-based 
Chempro, the same company that worked on the American Trader oil spill, would 
work through the night and could have the entire spill cleaned by early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Lane said the firm operates platforms Eva, Edith and Esther, all of which are 
between one and three miles off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shell Oil Co. also has platforms in the same area, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's spill was discovered on the beach shortly after 6 p.m., officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said a Shell Oil helicopter spotted the 
slick before it hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a shame we have to continue going through these problems," he 
said. "We've had minor problems with the platforms off the coast before, but I 
believe this is the first time the oil got to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's Lane said his company reported a 10-gallon spill at Platform Eva to 
the Coast Guard on Monday night but he said that incident is believed to be 
unrelated to the oil that washed up on Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a crew out at dawn looking for any oil on the water and couldn't find 
any," Lane said of the Monday night incident. He said a shield designed to trap 
oil had failed because of high winds, which sprayed the crude around the 
platform.

AIRPORT SET TO CROSS BRIDGE TO THE PRESENT

<P>
John Wayne Airport finally entered the 20th Century this week with delivery of 
Jetways, the telescoping passenger loading bridges that most large, urban 
airports have had for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
No more will bedraggled passengers have to trod across the concrete apron to 
reach their plane, only to have to climb a treacherous, metal 
stairway-on-wheels to get inside the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, passengers at John Wayne won't actually be able to use the 
Jetways until the airport's new $61-million terminal opens on Sept. 16, 
replacing a cramped, outdated facility reminiscent of airports in Third World 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"These Jetways will serve the aircraft, delivering power and water to the 
planes as well as passengers," said Bill Early, a construction supervisor for 
HPV, the firm hired by the county to manage the $310-million airport 
improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
During a media tour of the airport Tuesday, Early pointed to workers' 
connecting a complex system of hoses and electrical power cords from the gray, 
boxy bridges, which are supported at one end by a double-wheeled strut similar 
to an airplane's landing gear and at the other by the new, 338,000-square-foot 
terminal building. 
</P>
<P>
The new terminal will boast 14 of the Jetways, one for each gate. With the cost 
at about $214,000 each, the total bill for all 14 will be about $2,990,000, 
airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lego-like loading bridges are being installed by the same company that 
makes them in Ogden, Utah -- Jetway Systems Inc., a division of Abex Corp., 
which has been selling them to airports since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport officials said the small, existing passenger terminal, 
opened in 1967, was never equipped with Jetways because the grossly inadequate 
facility could park and service more aircraft without them. Jets are often 
double-parked next to the terminal, and passengers must walk on the apron 
between the terminal and the planes. The existing terminal was built to 
accommodate 400,000 passengers annually, but currently serves nearly 4.75 
million a year. The new passenger terminal will serve about 8.4 million 
passengers per year. 
</P>
<P>
The Jetways, which weigh 45,000 pounds each, are being delivered to the 
terminal in three pieces on flatbed trucks. Airport officials said it takes an 
average of five days to install each bridge, and all 14 will be completed and 
tested within 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Airline personnel will then undergo training in the use of the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
With controls in a cab at the front of the bridge, an operator can telescope 
the Jetway and move it around, sideways, and up or down. 
</P>
<P>
The smallest jetliner expected to use the loading bridges is the BAe-146, a 
small, twin-engine aircraft on which the fuselage hangs below the wings. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bridges will be longer than the others to accommodate larger 
aircraft, such as the Boeing 767. 
</P>
<P>
The bridges are connected to openings in the side of the new terminal building. 
The passenger waiting areas near the gates appeared almost finished Tuesday, 
except for airline ticket collection booths and chairs. The area looks like a 
long barn, with beige marble, beige carpeting and soft, indirect light from 
shell-shaped light fixtures and a vast expanse of glass window, all under a 
curved roof. 
</P>
<P>
One worker was vacuuming the carpeting while others were completing electrical 
wiring. Only short, see-over glass partitions separate each airline's passenger 
waiting area. 
</P>
<P>
The news media were invited to view the bridge installation work Tuesday, 
officials said, because the event is considered an important milestone that 
shows progress on the terminal construction project. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been troubled by delays and cost overruns. The Jetway "tour" 
came a day after the Orange County Grand Jury issued a report criticizing the 
management of the project.

The Irvine Co. will provide up to $19 million in funding for school 
construction at planned developments on the Newport Coast and in the San 
Joaquin Hills in lieu of future developer fees under an agreement announced 
Tuesday with the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the Irvine Co. to drop a lawsuit brought against the 
district in March, 1989, that challenged the amount of developer fees the 
district attempted to levy for construction of schools in the new communities. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was approved unanimously by the school board Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been involved in negotiations for over 18 months," said John Nicoll, 
Newport-Mesa school superintendent. "This is a splendid example of how the 
private sector and public sector can work together to solve some difficult 
problems. We feel this is a very fair arrangement and will work out to the good 
of the developers as well as the school district." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., which plans to build up to 6,000 residential units within the 
boundaries of the Newport-Mesa district, filed the suit in protest of the 
district's plans to charge the maximum allowable developer fees under state law 
of $1.50 per square foot for residential areas and 25 cents per square foot in 
commercial areas in the planned communities, said Jeanette Justus, schools 
facilities coordinator for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced Tuesday, the Irvine Co. will provide up to $19 
million for district use in the new communities planned in the Corona del Mar 
area in eastern Newport Beach. The figure includes a $5-million endowment for 
use as the district sees fit, of which $2 million will be provided immediately. 
The district will receive the remaining $3 million after the Irvine Co. 
receives the go-ahead from county planning officials and the Newport Beach City 
Council to start future development, Justus said. 
</P>
<P>
"This endowment is a direct contribution from the Irvine Co. to the children 
and families of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District," Irvine Co. Senior 
Vice President Gary Hunt said in a statement to the school board Tuesday. "It 
gives the district maximum flexibility in the use of these funds to develop and 
implement innovative programs and enhance the quality of education throughout 
the district in whatever way this board deems best." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for the Irvine Co. to immediately provide $4 million 
in funds for renovation of existing schools to serve students residing in new 
developments in San Joaquin Hills and the Newport Coast. Up to $10 million more 
would be made available for purchase of a 10-acre site and construction of a 
new elementary school if deemed necessary by the district, according to the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am personally very pleased and excited about this proposal," Hunt said in 
his written statement to the school board. "I am pleased because it resolves 
the current pending litigation between the district and the company and because 
of the opportunity it presents to us both to provide . . . for the school needs 
of new residents while at the same time benefiting existing residents of the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton H. Parker, an attorney representing the Newport-Mesa district, said 
both sides were pleased with the agreement. "We think it's a good deal," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. lawsuit marked the second time in as many years that the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District was challenged over developer fees. In 
1988, the Building and Industry Assn. filed a similar suit seeking repayment of 
$3 million in fees from the district. In March, 1989, Superior Court Judge 
Leonard Goldstein ruled that the district failed to show that its financial 
needs justified the maximum fees possible under state law and ordered the 
district to refund $600,000 in fees to a group of developers.

BOY TESTIFIES IN SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: HE SINGLES OUT HIS MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND AS THE MAN WHO BEAT HIS INFANT 
SISTER TO DEATH.

<P>
A 5-year-old boy, seated on a blanket and a pillow so he could see better from 
the witness stand, pointed to Steven Delgado on Tuesday as the man who he 
watched beat his infant sister to death in a night of terror last September. 
</P>
<P>
In a quiet courtroom, Johnny Ortiz, at times fidgeting with a paper cup, spent 
more than an hour testifying in the murder trial of Delgado, who was 
romantically linked with the boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve came in, he hit Amanda and hit me, and that's how Amanda died," the boy 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado, 22, is on trial for the slaying of 11-month-old Amanda and an assault 
on Johnny last Sept. 26 in the apartment of the boy's mother in Santa Ana. If 
convicted of first-degree murder, Delgado could be sentenced to a maximum of 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Neither prosecutors nor police have suggested a motive for the killing. But 
Manuel Ortiz, the father of both children, said he believed that Delgado killed 
his daughter because she was interfering with Delgado's romantic relationship 
with the mother, Elizabeth Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
In initial questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr., the boy 
identified Delgado without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on the floor, and I was in the bed," he said, describing the moments 
before the attack that left his sister dead. "She was just going to come up to 
bed, and I helped her up." 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who is now in the custody of his father, told jurors that he was in 
bed with his sister when Delgado entered the room, threw Amanda against a wall, 
beat her repeatedly with his fist, and then hit him in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony matched a videotaped statement he made to police last year. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy found that injuries to the girl's abdomen were the primary cause of 
death. Two skull fractures and multiple chest bruises also were found, Gannon 
told jurors in last Wednesday's opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite close questioning by defense attorney Frederick L. McBride that 
produced apparent inconsistencies in his testimony, Johnny maintained his 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
McBride focused his questioning on the "two bad men" who Johnny first told 
authorities had entered the apartment and struck him that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had told the police any lies, Johnny responded, "No." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Officer Michael D. Fuller testified last week that he found no 
signs of forced entry into the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the boy also acknowledged that he had told police that Delgado 
did not kill his sister. But when asked whether that was the truth or a lie, 
the boy said he did not remember. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, McBride tried unsuccessfully to have the boy's testimony excluded 
from the trial. He contended that an interview conducted following the 
investigation was "so suggestive that the child's memory was distorted." 
</P>
<P>
Gannon said Delgado and Ruiz, who worked together at a Santa Ana insurance 
firm, became romantically involved five months before her child's death. 
Delgado had a key to Ruiz's North Durant Street apartment and had known her 
since childhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At times, both McBride and Gannon appeared frustrated with Ruiz's testimony. 
Last week in the courtroom of Orange County Superior Judge Ragnar Engebretsen, 
both questioned her repeatedly about inconsistent accounts she has given of the 
events that occurred on the night her daughter was killed. Ruiz testified that 
she was not present at the time of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Because they were witnesses in the trial, neither she nor Johnny's father was 
present in the courtroom Tuesday while he was testifying except when he was 
asked whether he could identify the person who committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, both mother and father were brought into the courtroom and 
seated in the front row. Gannon declined to explain why. 
</P>
<P>
After the boy identified Delgado, the parents were escorted out by bailiffs. 
Gannon said the unusual action had been agreed upon in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony by young children is not unusual in criminal cases, said James G. 
Enright, the county's chief deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"They have several young victims testify in child molestation cases," Enright 
said. "The main determination is that they can recall (what happened) and they 
know what it is to tell a lie."

The Police Department has announced plans for its second annual decoy program, 
a sting aimed at stores and bars that sell liquor to minors. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, on a random basis, young-looking Police Department workers will be 
visiting stores and restaurants. If they are not asked for sufficient 
identification, then the store will be cited for serving or selling liquor to 
minors, Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
It is important for business owners to know that alcohol violations increase 
during the summer, he said, and that by strictly checking identifications, 
drunk-driving accidents can be reduced. LAURA MICHAELIS

COUNCIL VOTES DOWN STOP SIGNS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After occasionally angry public testimony both for and against the idea of 
putting six new stop signs along Balboa Boulevard, the City Council voted 5 to 
2 against it Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council voted to accept a motion by Councilman Donald A. Strauss 
to install reflective plastic strips at all existing crosswalks and add six new 
crosswalks. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 50 people turned out for the meeting, and audience members 
appeared nearly split on the issue. Some residents argued that speeds on the 
boulevard are too high, making it difficult and dangerous to cross the street. 
Other homeowners said that more stop signs would exacerbate already serious 
weekend traffic problems and called for stricter enforcement of existing speed 
limits instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Presently, I have eight stops to make; to add six more is just totally 
ludicrous," peninsula resident Richard Voit told the council. "I'm sick of 
having to spend my summers in traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's proposal for more stop signs came out of a series of meetings by a 
committee of residents, council members and city traffic staff. Residents and 
homeowners' associations along the peninsula have been asking the city to slow 
traffic along the main street for years and have strongly opposed the 
suggestions of a city consultant to eliminate crosswalks in favor of fewer, 
lighted pedestrian crossings. 
</P>
<P>
There are now seven traffic signals and one stop sign on Balboa Boulevard. 
Monday's decision means that the city will not establish signs at the 
intersections of Balboa and G Street, Island Avenue and 10th, 18th, 35th and 
42nd streets. 
</P>
<P>
But the council approved the installation of high-visibility crosswalks at all 
current crosswalk locations on Balboa as well as at new walkways at 34th, 35th, 
36th, 40th, 42nd and 44th streets at a total cost of $38,000. LAURA MICHAELIS

U.S. TO FUND LATINO LANGUAGE PROGRAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About $1 million in federal money will be used to fund a five-year program to 
help Latino youngsters gain language skills. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which begins July 1, will target students in kindergarten through 
second grade whose primary language is Spanish, said Gail Reed, director of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"If a student has strong Spanish skills, they usually make the transition very 
quickly and easily into English," Reed said. "But many students come to us 
lacking skills in their primary language. (For them) making a transition takes 
much longer than it should." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education will provide about $215,000 for each of the 
five years of the program. The money will pay for classroom costs, as well as a 
secretary and three community liaisons who will work with parents to encourage 
participation in helping their children learn. 
</P>
<P>
The project will serve about 450 students in bilingual classrooms. DAVID F.

40 PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN ABORTION PROTEST

<P>
More than 40 Operation Rescue supporters, including former Tustin Councilman 
John Kelly, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges related to an April 
anti-abortion protest in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's solidarity, everyone's sticking together," said Kelly, who was arrested 
three days after failing to win reelection to the council. 
</P>
<P>
A July 11 pretrial hearing was set for the majority of the cases, according to 
John Kuhl, executive officer for the Central Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
John Barthrop, attorney for 42 of the cases, said he unsuccessfully tried to 
negotiate a plea bargain for the defendants. The deputy district attorney 
handling the cases was out ill on Tuesday, but Barthrop said a representative 
of the office told him that any deal would include three years' informal 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are willing to perform community service but do not want to be 
on informal probation, Barthrop said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district attorney's office has also indicated that the 
demonstrators may be required to pay for some of the police costs related to 
the demonstration. A Tustin Police Department spokesman has said the four 
police agencies responding to the protest racked up more than $14,000 in costs. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters were originally charged with criminal trespassing, but the 
charges were later changed to obstructing a passageway and resisting a peace 
officer in the discharge of duties, Barthrop said. 
</P>
<P>
The protest occurred on Good Friday outside the Doctors Family Planning Medical 
Group on Irvine Boulevard. About 350 Operation Rescue supporters blocked the 
clinic's three entrances for nine hours. SHANNON SANDS

EXTORTION NETS $19,500 FROM COMPUTER STORE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ASIAN GANG MEMBERS ARE SUSPECTED OF ABDUCTING A COMPUTER STORE OWNER AND 
AN EMPLOYEE AND FORCING THEM TO WITHDRAW FUNDS FROM A BANK ACCOUNT.

<P>
When Michelle McDonald opened her computer store four months ago, she knew it 
could be targeted for robbery by Asian gang members who have preyed on similar 
businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Vietnamese-American entrepreneur said her worst fears came true 
when four men kidnaped her and a store employee at gunpoint and forced them to 
withdraw $19,500 from the store's bank account. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were crazy," McDonald said, describing four-hour ordeal at the 
hands of her captors. "I was scared something like this might happen." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Asian gangs have pulled off a number of computer thefts 
throughout Orange County, stealing millions of dollars worth of computer 
microchips and computer hardware. In some cases, the gangs also have taken 
large sums of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Several crime rings, involving groups operating mostly out of Westminster, 
Garden Grove and Santa Ana, are under investigation by federal and local 
authorities. In many cases, investigators say, the bandits have carried out 
highly organized, paramilitary-type missions at some of the state's best known 
computer concerns -- binding and gagging workers and routinely issuing death 
threats against them. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, police said that McDonald, 21, of Westminster, was 
accosted by four men as she was opening the doors of Compu+plus Inc. at 15569 
Brookhurst St. about 9:10 a.m. The suspects forced McDonald and the store 
manager, David P. Tran, into a 1984 black Chevrolet Blazer and took them to an 
empty house in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the men then demanded that she go to her bank in Garden Grove and 
withdraw $10,000, while they stayed in the house holding Tran hostage. 
</P>
<P>
When she came back with the money, the men then demanded an additional $10,000, 
she said. This time, Tran went to the bank while McDonald was held at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said she was unexpectedly released by her captors before Tran returned 
to the vacant house with $9,500 in cash he had withdrawn from the bank. 
McDonald said the 34-year-old Tran gave the abductors the money but refused to 
cooperate further. 
</P>
<P>
According to McDonald, Tran then escaped on foot as one of the gunmen fired two 
shots, apparently into the ceiling of the house. McDonald, meanwhile, had 
contacted police and led them to the house, but the gunman had already fled. 
</P>
<P>
Neither McDonald nor Tran was hurt in the ordeal, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators would not say if the suspects in the case were believed to be 
members of the same Asian gangs that have preyed on other computer businesses 
in recent months, and they declined to release details of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Asian gangs have stolen computer microchips, devices used to store 
and retrieve data, and sold them on the black market, police investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's "terrifying experience" McDonald said she is "scared this might 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
But despite her kidnaping, McDonald said she will not close her store. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to live the American way," she said. "Computers is a good business, but 
it's dangerous."

charged with finding a new airport site in or near Orange County, voting 
instead to pursue a remote location in the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
It had taken members of the Airport Site Coalition, a broad-based group of 
civic and business leaders, more than two years to narrow its search to four 
locations, two of them in South Orange County. But the supervisors and a 
county-appointed committee took less than two months to reject all four 
locations, citing "significant impediments to each of them." 
</P>
<P>
"For me, to envision any kind of major aviation activity in Orange County is 
beyond the reach of possibility," Board Chairman Don R. Roth said after the 
meeting. "To try to build an airport in an area as congested as this county is 
just impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Roth is an outspoken advocate of super-speed rail, and proponents of that 
system say it could make the desert airport site more realistic by providing an 
easy way for Orange County residents to use the proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
Both the supervisors and members of the Airport Site Coalition are trying to 
find a suitable location for another regional airport in Southern California in 
order to relieve congestion at already crowded John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, delivered in April, the coalition's recommendation of airport 
sites included Cristianitos Canyon east of San Juan Capistrano and Potrero Los 
Pinos in the Cleveland National Forest -- both located inside the county. The 
coalition also recommended South Camp Pendleton in San Diego County and March 
Air Force Base in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the coalition, however, the Board of Supervisors is under strong 
political pressure to resist an Orange County site. The board favors George Air 
Force Base, about 80 miles north of Anaheim near Adelanto in San Bernardino 
County. The base is scheduled to close within three years, and Adelanto's mayor 
urged the supervisors Tuesday to consider that site. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Adelanto welcomes your interest in this project," Mayor Edward 
Dandelinger said. "We have an airport that has the capacity to handle your 
needs for the next 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, advocates of the desert site see it as far more than just another 
local airport. Armed with an array of glitzy visual devices, Costa Mesa Mayor 
Peter F. Buffa touted the site, which he referred to as a "mega-port," and 
predicted that the new facility could not only support new air traffic demand 
but could also be home to a proposed "space plane." 
</P>
<P>
For Adelanto, the airport proposal represents a potentially huge source of 
revenue at a time when the town is losing its Air Force base. That city's 
eagerness to accept an airport was in marked contrast to the reaction of 
officials from Orange County, who also appeared at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We will use every means at our disposal, legal, political and otherwise to 
stop an airport at Cristianitos," San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Larry 
Buchheim warned the supervisors. He warmly welcomed the George Air Force Base 
proposal, however, calling it "absolutely fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Costa Mesa and San Clemente also said they would reject any 
proposal to build another Orange County airport, and Mike Eggers, a staff aide 
to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), reiterated Packard's longstanding opposition 
to construction of an airport in South County. 
</P>
<P>
While the Orange County officials are eager to see the George Air Force Base 
option succeed, the proposal faces formidable problems. It is by far the most 
remote of the options under consideration, and transportation to and from the 
airport would be over huge distances. 
</P>
<P>
A super-speed train offers the simplest solution to that problem, but officials 
concede that many details about it remain uncertain. San Francisco-based 
Bechtel Corp. has indicated interest in building the rail, and putting the 
airport on one of its lines would make it more profitable.

A tip from a concerned sister led police Tuesday to the body of a 27-year-old 
accountant who was apparently stabbed to death in his apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Glenn Deveney said the victim was identified as Mark Tomasulo, who 
shared an apartment on the 2400 block of Nutwood Avenue with a 19-year-old man 
whose whereabouts were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Deveney said that police received a call shortly after 3 p.m. Tuesday from 
Michelle Fredrickson of Fullerton, who requested that officers check on the 
welfare of her brother because he had not been seen or heard from since 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police went to the Nutwood address and found Tomasulo's body bearing stab 
wounds, Deveney said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim reportedly worked as an accountant for Beckman 
Instruments and had not been at his job for two days.

COCAINE BABIES: BORN IN AWFUL FIX; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: RESEARCHER TELLS AUDIENCE OF PEDIATRICIANS ABOUT DEFORMITIES AND WARNS 
THAT 'THERE IS NO SAFE TIME' FOR USE DURING PREGNANCY.

"There is no safe time to use cocaine in pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
That was the message pediatric researcher Ira J. Chasnoff brought to 100 Orange 
County pediatricians Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his nationally known research on addicted mothers and their babies, 
Chasnoff said cocaine use in pregnancy can cause not only low-weight, 
premature, highly irritable babies, but also anatomical deformities -- among 
them urinary and genital tract malformations, bowel perforations and tiny hands 
with only two fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The baby may have been normal, the Chicago researchers said, but a single hit 
of cocaine may cause blood vessels in the mother and her fetus to constrict, 
digits on the developing baby to hemorrhage and the baby to be born without 
some of its fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Chasnoff was invited to Orange County not just because local doctors were 
interested in the issue. Rather Orange County has a growing problem of 
drug-exposed babies too. County officials say more than 1,200 "drug babies" 
were born here last year and many experts here believe the number is even 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Before Chasnoff spoke, pediatricians from Fountain Valley and Los Alamitos said 
they have seen a growing number of drug-exposed babies in their private 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a (hospital) nursery in the county where you don't have two to 
three babies lying around whose mothers were on drugs," said Burton Willis, a 
Fountain Valley pediatrician who is president-elect of the Orange County 
Pediatric Society. 
</P>
<P>
Chasnoff said his studies show that white, middle-class women who visit private 
doctors are using drugs at about the same rate as black women who receive 
prenatal care at public clinics. 
</P>
<P>
He sounded one note of hope, however. Drug-exposed babies at age 2 have caught 
up to normal babies in both weight and height, he said. Further, he emphasized, 
"these babies are not retarded." 
</P>
<P>
Some of them may have school problems, he said, but at this point studies have 
not been completed on these children past age 2. Also, he said, rather than 
being "doomed" because they were exposed to drugs before birth, the babies can 
be helped by physicians to catch up to their peers.

QUOTES OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sorry, but I'm not much of a morning person." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brea-Olinda guard Aimee McDaniel, who emerged from the locker room wearing 
pink slippers after Auburn Placer had ended the Lady Cats' 55-game winning 
streak in the State Division III championship game played in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not going to Disneyland; I'm going to Vegas!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Esperanza sprinter Roshawn Sims, after winning three events at the Orange 
County Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
If we do wind up ranked No. 1, you won't find me reading about it. What does it 
mean? One day you're up and the next day you're a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Rofer, Edison boys' volleyball coach, after the Chargers upset 
Huntington Beach, ranked No. 1 in the Orange County Coaches' poll at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Apologetics. That's the defense of the Christian religion. I think a 
creationist theory is intellectually supportable. . . . I'm fascinated by 
morality and ethics and why people follow certain religions." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saddleback High School distance runner Robby Price, a straight-A student, 
junior theologian and heavy-metal drummer. 
</P>
<P>
I guess I'll just study." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former Servite running back Derek Brown after learning last summer that he 
had to sit out his freshman year at Nebraska because he failed to meet academic 
requirements under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
I hate it. I think it's real stupid. The SAT and the ACT are just trying to get 
your money. You could be a 4.0 student and you could still get a low score on 
the test. The tests have nothing to do with your schoolwork. I totally dislike 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brown, after passing the ACT last winter and becoming eligible for the fall 
semester at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Something that's easy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Alamitos basketball player Robert Conlisk when asked what would be his 
major at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
It's sad but funny. Nobody won the game, we ended up forfeiting their forfeit." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fountain Valley Athletic Director Mike Henigan after the Barons had to 
forfeit a football game to Huntington Beach because of an ineligible player. 
Huntington Beach had already forfeited the game to Fountain Valley for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
When the fleet's in, they're mighty tough." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laguna Beach Coach Ed Bowen when asked what he knew about the Coronado 
basketball team. 
</P>

We're the bad boys of the South Coast League and sometimes we have to defend 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Capistrano Valley basketball player Scott McCorkle after the Cougars had 
been involved in two fights in two games. 
</P>
<P>
I think (Southern Section Associate Commissioner) Dean Crowley wants to make 
sure he gets home in time to watch David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magnolia High School Coach Bob Mangan, on the announcement that the triple 
jump portion of Southern Section track and field championships would be 
postponed for three days because the meet was running late. 
</P>
<P>
I think the pineapple was the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dos Pueblos basketball player Adam Estabrook, who was one of five Charger 
players who came down with food poisoning the day of the Southern California 
Regional Division II final against Servite. The night before the game, the 
players had eaten a pizza topped with pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and 
pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
You just climb way up in this tree and jump. You let yourself fall, and the 
boughs kind of catch you. You can get pretty scraped up, but I've never really 
gotten hurt . . . I'm not that crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- El Toro hurdler David Fair, on his favorite hobby -- flying from trees. 
</P>
<P>
You have to be careful with Estancia, they run a Heckle and Hyde." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Servite basketball coach Richard Smith during a practice prior to the 
Friars' Southern Section 3-AA championship game against Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
If the playoffs had been postponed a week, Coy (Collins) could have played. 
Maybe we should have filed something in court." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loara football Coach Herb Hill after the Saxons, minus their star running 
back, lost to Santa Ana, 3-0, in the first round of the Southern Section 
Division III playoffs. Collins, who rushed for 1,666 yards, missed the game 
because of a deep thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
The thing doesn't bark, howl or whine. It could be the perfect player." 
</P>
<P>
 -- La Serna baseball Coach Vern Hodge describing the team's mascot, an iguana 
owned by pitcher Willie Adams. 
</P>
<P>
I even made them sign a contract. No kidding. My parents are tricky people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dana Hills discus thrower Andy Marrone on his parents' promise to buy him 
the car of his choice if he threw more than 190 feet this season. Marrone threw 
192-1 May 18, and less than 24 hours later, drove away with "the whole primo 
four-wheel drive vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
It was like all of us were in a fog. Huntington Beach was in a San Francisco 
fog and we were in a Laguna fog. Their fog was thicker than ours." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lance Stewart, boys' volleyball coach at Laguna Beach, after watching his 
team defeat Huntington Beach in a sloppy five-game match. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been nice to get at least one more win before retiring . . . or 
even a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Alamitos baseball Coach Mike Gibson after the Griffins were no-hit by 
Ocean View's Jim Gwaltney in the first round of the Southern Section 5-A 
playoffs. It was Gibson's last game as coach.

PREPS: LEGAL CHALLENGES TO SOUTHERN SECTION'S AUTHORITY BY FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS 
AT HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SAVANNA WAS SCHOOL YEAR'S TOP STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two ineligible football players, the forfeiture of two league championships and 
14 victories and, finally, three court cases testing the Southern Section's 
supremacy added up to the story of the year in Orange County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High's football team forfeited eight victories and its share 
of the Sunset League title and was ruled ineligible for the Division I playoffs 
last fall by a vote of its league's principals for using an ineligible player 
the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Savanna's football team was forced by league principals to 
forfeit six victories, its Orange League co-championship and a berth in the 
Division VI playoffs for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a week of restraining orders, student protests, appeals 
panels and litigation. Judges, not the players, were deciding who wins football 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach played a game of legal Ping-Pong, regaining its playoff spot 
through a temporary restraining order that threatened the existence of the 
Southern Section, the organization that governs member schools throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach replaced Fountain Valley in the Division I playoffs and was 
scheduled to meet top-seeded Fontana on a Tuesday. Two days later, the Oilers 
were thrown for a loss after a three-judge panel of the Fourth District Court 
of Appeals took Huntington Beach out of the playoffs and reinstated Fountain 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals panel ruled that the Southern Section had the right to bar the team 
from competition for using an ineligible player. Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half hours before Fountain Valley was scheduled to meet Fontana, the 
father of a Huntington Beach player filed a federal lawsuit in a last-ditch 
effort to stop the game, but a judge refused to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing the impact he faced if he granted the order to stop the game, U.S. 
District Judge J. Spencer Letts said, "It looks like the choices are to forfeit 
the game and watch the riot or play it and then not count it." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Patterson, CIF attorney, watched the clock ticking to 6 p.m. and 
wondered if the Southern Section could stop the game at that hour. 
</P>
<P>
"The school buses have left and the field is open to the public," Patterson 
said. "One or more of the teams is practicing on the field right now." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Savanna, about 1,000 students walked out of their classes that 
week in protest of the team's last-minute disqualification for playing a 
fifth-year senior who had attended three public high schools and two 
continuation schools since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions over an administrative error spilled onto the Savanna campus, where 
hundreds of students congregated on the front lawn, yelling slogans and waving 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's boosters took their case to the courtroom, where an Orange County 
Superior Court commissioner ruled that the team had been properly removed from 
postseason play by Orange League principals. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no abuse of discretion or violation of the rules," said Commissioner 
Julian Cimbaluk in ruling that there were no grounds to reinstate Savanna in 
the playoffs. "They (the league principals) didn't arbitrarily disqualify the 
team. They had the right to do so under the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, players, students, administrators, parents and boosters from both 
schools were distraught. Huntington Beach had earned only its third playoff 
berth in 23 years. Savanna had won its first league title since the school 
opened in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Courtroom cases had the biggest impact in the 1989-90 school year, but there 
were other noteworthy accomplishments, both on and off the athletic fields. 
Here's the best of the rest: 
</P>
<P>
The Shot of the Year: It was more of an afterthought than a shot, but point 
guard Jason Quinn's 20-foot desperation shot with 1.8 seconds remaining gave 
Mater Dei a 46-45 victory over Long Beach Poly in the Southern California 
Division I title game. Mater Dei went on to win its second state title. 
</P>
<P>
A Gentleman Coach Retires: Herb Hill surpassed Anaheim's Clare VanHoorebeke as 
the county's winningest football coach in his final season at Loara. Hill, 59, 
won 191 games in 28 seasons as Loara's only coach since the school opened in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
Who's No. 1?: The question of the county's best football team was settled in 
the final regular-season game, when Capistrano Valley met El Toro in a battle 
of unbeatens. Capistrano Valley won, 22-21, when tailback Chris Adams scored a 
touchdown and added a two-point conversion run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
An Impressive Streak Ends: The Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team had won 55 
consecutive games when it entered the Oakland Coliseum Arena for the State 
Division III title game against Auburn Placer. Brea's players left in tears 
after a 54-43 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's Minor Miracle: Three-year starting catcher Robin Lindsey quit the team 
for three days, Coach Paul Renfrow's job was in jeopardy at one time and the 
school's baseball team had failed to qualify for postseason play for 10 years. 
But the Vikings scored five consecutive upsets to win the 5-A division title at 
Anaheim Stadium. Lindsey got the championship game-winning hit in a 6-4 victory 
over Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Getting to the Point: Amy Jalewalia of La Quinta established a county 
single-game scoring record with 60 points in an 85-32 victory over Kennedy. 
Jalewalia broke former Whittier Christian standout Cindy Vyskocil's mark of 59 
points set in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Tough: Reacting to increased violence at prep games, principals of six 
high schools in the Fullerton Union High School District adopted an athletic 
conduct policy that allows schools to suspend coaches or players who are 
ejected from athletic events, involved in altercations or leave the sideline or 
bench during an altercation. 
</P>
<P>
A Record Leap: Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia set a county record in the 
triple jump with his leap of 51 feet 7 3/4 inches -- the second-best mark in 
the nation -- to win the state title. Singbandith, a native of Laos, immigrated 
to California with his family as a 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
An Undefeated Career: Zach Cooper, Canyon's 191-pound wrestler, capped a 
brilliant career by winning the first National High School Wrestling 
Championship in Pittsburgh, Pa. Cooper won 100 matches without a loss over the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
A Parochial Decision: Members of the Southern Section's general council voted 
that "program compatibility" is not a criteria for placing schools into 
geographic areas for the purposes of putting them in a league. The vote opens 
the door for private schools in the county to join public leagues in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY RECORD-SETTERS 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
D.C. Olsen of Fullerton set two county single-season records. His 13 home runs 
surpassed the 12 hit by Andy Ruscitto of Valencia in 1986, and his .595 batting 
average bettered the .585 mark set in 1980 by Steve Evans of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia of La Quinta set a county single-game scoring record of 60 points 
in an 85-32 Garden Grove League victory over Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Fischer of Edison set a national record for three-point baskets in a 
season (105). She also set a Southern Section record for most three-point 
baskets in a game (10), a feat she managed twice. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Ron Papazian of Whittier Christian set a county single-season record with 35 
touchdowns, breaking the former mark of 32 set in 1984 by Esperanza's Jim 
Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
With a 43-7 Empire League victory over El Dorado, Loara Coach Herb Hill 
recorded his county career record 191st victory, surpassing the 190 games won 
by Clare VanHoorebeke, former Anaheim coach. 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
Gavin Arroyo of Villa Park set a Southern Section record in the 100-yard 
freestyle with a time of 45.30 seconds, which broke the 45.31 mark set in 1987 
by Darren Ward of Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Carlson of Katella won the state high jump title with a leap of 7 feet, 
breaking the former county record of 6-11 3/4 set in 1983 by Foothill's Doug 
Dreibelbis -- a record tied by Carlson earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia set the county record in the triple jump with 
a leap of 51- 3/4 at the Arcadia Invitational. Singbandith bettered that mark 
with a 51-7 3/4 to win the state title. The previous county record of 50-3 1/2 
was set in 1982 by Troy's Ken Williams.

SAUDI BUSINESSMEN SEE BIG MARKET FOR SAVVY U.S. FIRMS;

TRADE: JAPAN HAS SURPASSED THE UNITED STATES AS THE ARAB NATION'S LEADING

As Saudi Arabia gears up to build more schools, erect steel plants and expand 
its hospital facilities, U.S. companies will have increased opportunity in that 
market -- but not if they don't pay more attention to local market needs and 
social customs, several members of a Saudi business delegation said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Dabbagh, secretary general of the Saudi Council of Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry in Riyadh, said U.S. companies have lost their edge in 
the Saudi market and noted that Japan has surpassed the United States as the 
Arab nation's leading trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Dabbagh blamed a lack of aggressive marketing by U.S. companies and their 
reluctance to learn foreign trade practices. He also said a lack of long-term 
commitment by U.S. firms and weak government support have hurt U.S. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago," he said, "the Japanese overtook the United States as our 
country's leading trade partner," despite a strong appreciation of the yen, 
which made Japanese products more expensive to foreign consumers. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Japanese companies, with a sound marketing strategy and a 
sizable share of the Saudi market, will continue to prosper at the expense of 
U.S. competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi business group was visiting Newport Beach at the invitation of the 
World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County. The Saudi business leaders met with 
executives from the county's computer, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries 
to discuss opportunities for foreign companies in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
James Chang, president of Compulink Associates, an Irvine trading firm 
specializing in high-technology goods, said he hopes to supply Saudi Arabian 
companies with computer parts from the suppliers in Orange County and the Far 
East. 
</P>
<P>
While Dabbagh said he believes that U.S.-Saudi trade relations are relatively 
sound, he added that conflicts between the two countries continue over Middle 
East policy and U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia accounts for 50% of all U.S. trade with the Arab world, making it 
the eighth-largest trading partner of the United States. In the last year, 
bilateral trade reached $11 billion, with the U.S. suffering a multibillion 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
One major reason why U.S. businesses are falling behind is that U.S. companies 
have not kept up with changes in the Arab country, asserted Wahib BinzagrCQ, 
chairman of the Saudi Cairo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"American companies should adapt to Saudi specifications, especially in selling 
environmental equipment in our country," he said. "If not, they will lose out 
to more aggressive companies from the Pacific Rim, such as Japan, South Korea 
and Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
More important, the U.S. government should allow U.S. businesses more leeway in 
selling their goods abroad, members of the delegation said, referring to U.S. 
government restrictions on the sale of military equipment to the Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't buy (defense-related equipment) here, we can always buy it 
elsewhere," Dabbagh said. "There are the British, Italians and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Saudi Arabians would rather buy U.S. defense and 
technology equipment because of its superior quality.

GROCERY BILL TOO HIGH? JUST STEP OVER TO TELLER CAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: AS COMPETITION FOR DEPOSITS INTENSIFIES, UNION BANK WILL OPEN BRANCHES 
THIS WEEK AT SUPERMARKETS IN SANTA ANA AND FOUNTAIN VALLEY. 
</P>

<P>
Soon you will be able to pick up a car loan along with the carrots, cookies and 
canned goods. 
</P>
<P>
Union Bank, the state's fifth-largest banking organization, said Tuesday that 
it will open full-service bank branches this week in two Ralphs supermarkets in 
Orange County -- one at 1900 N. Grand Ave. in Santa Ana and the other at 18405 
Brookhurst St. in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
While some grocery stores now have automatic teller machines where customers 
can withdraw money any time, this marks the first time in Orange County that a 
major bank will offer branches open every day of the week and staffed with 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is part of the increasing competition in California for consumer 
deposits. Union and other major banks have been offering a variety of services 
-- from free checking to debit cards -- to attract new customers. 
</P>
<P>
And what better place to put a branch than a grocery store -- a place most 
people spend money weekly? "You don't see as many people in almost any retail 
outlet as you do in a grocery store," said Steven Rizzuto, administrating 
manager for Union's in-store banking. "We'll see 15,000 to 20,000 faces a week, 
or about 10,000 households. That demonstrates the convenience aspect of what 
we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Union, which opened five branches in Ralphs stores in San Diego in February, 
plans to open 15 branches in Ralphs stores in Southern California by the end of 
the year and up to 50 branches in various supermarkets throughout the state in 
the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
The first 15 branches will be concentrated in Orange, San Diego, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers of the San Francisco-based bank can make deposits, take out loans and 
conduct any type of business at the bank with these exceptions: There are no 
safe deposit boxes and no bank personnel to handle corporate customers who want 
commercial loans. 
</P>
<P>
Each Union branch takes up 275 to 300 square feet. Up to eight employees will 
man each branch, with half on duty at any one time. The store branches are open 
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Union is not the first bank in the state to launch Sunday hours or banking in 
supermarkets. Two smaller banks, Antelope Valley Bank in Lancaster and Freemont 
Bank near San Francisco, opened in grocery stores with Sunday hours shortly 
before Union did. And Citicorp Savings has an experimental program with three 
branches open on Sundays in Ralphs stores in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Union, with more than $16 billion in assets and 170 branch offices, is the 
biggest commercial bank so far to move into supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto said one of the bonuses with a store branch is that little money is 
spent on the bricks and mortar of a bank building. 
</P>
<P>
"The grocery store itself is our lobby," he said.

BILL MAY CURB CREDIT REPORTING ABUSES; 
</P>
<P>
PRIVACY: FIRMS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING HIGH ERROR RATES, FAILING TO PROVIDE 
CREDIT HISTORIES TO CONSUMERS AND SELLING DATA TO DIRECT-MAIL MARKETERS.

A House subcommittee and the Bush Administration appeared to be moving closer 
to agreement Tuesday on legislation that would put greater limits on the 
private data banks -- including Orange-based TRW Credit Data -- that keep 
computerized credit records on millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration representative, the Federal Trade Commission and public 
interest groups backed many of the major provisions of a compromise bill. It is 
one of three competing bills before the House consumer affairs subcommittee 
that are aimed at overhauling the Fair Credit Reporting Act's provisions on 
credit reporting agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The act has come under fire in recent years as being riddled with loopholes 
that have allowed abuses in the credit data industry. The "credit bureaus," as 
the information storehouses are commonly called, have been accused of having 
high error rates that result in denial of credit, failing to provide complete 
copies of credit histories to consumers and invading personal privacy by 
selling some of their information to direct-mail marketers. 
</P>
<P>
While hundreds of credit bureaus exist around the nation, the industry is 
dominated by three giants -- Equifax Inc., TRW Credit Data and Trans Union 
Corp. The agencies tell merchants whether prospective customers pay their bills 
in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Guiton, director of the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs and a special 
assistant to President Bush, praised some major points in the compromise bill. 
Among them was a provision to allow individuals to prevent credit bureaus from 
adding their names to junk mailing lists that are sold to marketers. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise bill offered by the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Richard H. 
Lehman (D-Sanger), represents a softer approach to the mailing list issue. Two 
other measures before the subcommittee would ban the practice altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Guiton said Administration opposition to the Lehman bill centers on provisions 
that would require credit bureaus to give consumers one free credit report a 
year and offer updates for no more than $8 each. She said credit bureaus should 
be allowed to charge a fee that will cover their actual costs of providing the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three major credit bureaus and their trade organization 
said they believe that the legislation is unnecessary. They said the 
subcommittee should not pass a bill based simply on a handful of highly 
publicized complaints about allegations of wrongdoing and illegal taps into 
credit bureau computers. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that is prudent to alter radically a law and a system that 
has served both consumers and the credit granting community on the basis of a 
few horror stories," said Walter R. Kurth, president of the trade association, 
Associated Credit Bureaus Inc.

San Francisco-based Community Arts Inc. has been chosen by the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors to curate the inaugural exhibit of an arts program at the 
new John Wayne Airport Terminal, slated to be dedicated Sept. 7. The nonprofit 
firm has been coordinating San Francisco International Airport's exhibition 
program for 10 years, a county official said Tuesday.

The inaugural exhibit, expected to last through December, will focus on Orange

Seminal British punk-era band Wire will not perform Friday at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre as originally announced. No replacement has been set for Wire, 
which was scheduled to open for Erasure. A spokeswoman for Avalon Attractions, 
which books Irvine Meadows shows, did not give a reason for the change. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents Come Out," a video that profiles six families and how they cope with 
the news that a child is gay or lesbian, will air today through Friday on 
Irvine's public-access cable station, Channel 3. The 30-minute video was 
produced by the San Francisco chapter of Parents and Friends of Gays and 
Lesbians. The screenings, at 8 p.m. today and 7:30 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 
are sponsored by Irvine Citizens United, a group formed last year to combat 
Measure N, the Irvine initiative that eventually eliminated protections against 
discrimination based on sexual orientation from the city's human rights 
ordinance.

<P>
ADMINISTRATION: AN ANGLO HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR, 
RAISING CONCERN ABOUT COMMITMENT TO INCREASING WOMEN AND MINORITY STUDENTS AND 
FACULTY.

A UC Irvine dean's nomination to be the university's No. 2 administrator has 
raised fears among some on campus that it signals a shift away from a strong 
commitment to raising the number of women and minority faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason has recommended that L. Dennis Smith, UCI's 
dean of biological sciences since 1987, be named executive vice chancellor for 
academic affairs, a spokeswoman for Peltason confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents holds the actual hiring authority and it is scheduled 
to consider the chancellor's recommendation during a special closed session 
Friday at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 52-year-old Anglo, would replace Chang-Lin Tien, the highest ranking 
minority member at UCI, who has been widely praised for backing efforts to 
recruit, hire and keep minorities and women on campus. Tien becomes chancellor 
at UC Berkeley on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that most of the administrators and deans here are white males, to 
replace an Asian administrator with another white male is symbolic," said one 
woman faculty member who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. "It sends 
a message that they (the university's search committee) were in such a hurry 
they couldn't find (qualified minority candidates)." 
</P>
<P>
Others say Smith has a record of supporting and fostering affirmative action 
programs in biological sciences, where there is a nationwide shortage of women 
and under-represented minorities such as blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Eloy Rodriguez, a professor of cell biology at UCI, said Smith joined him in 
seeking a $1.2-million, five-year grant from the Hughes Foundation that is 
expected to bring 100 minority students a year into UCI's biological sciences 
program. "Dennis understands the importance of this, and he seems to be highly 
committed and supportive of (affirmative action efforts)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel N. Gomez, an assistant vice chancellor who oversees UCI's efforts to 
attract women and minority students, predicted that Smith would "continue the 
powerful momentum" to increase diversity started by Peltason and Tien. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Peltason nor Smith returned telephone calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The names of three white men and one black woman were among the four finalists 
whose names were forwarded to Peltason last month, according to sources close 
to the 20-member search committee. 
</P>
<P>
While all four finalists were rated extremely qualified, several campus sources 
said there was a deep division among the 20-member search committee. Several 
women and minority members reportedly favored UCLA Vice Chancellor Claudia 
Mitchell-Kernan, the only woman and minority among the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell-Kernan, an anthropology professor who last year was named UCLA's vice 
chancellor for graduate programs, declined comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The other finalists were: David J. Ramsay, senior vice chancellor for academic 
affairs at UC San Francisco, and Paul S. Sypherd, UCI's vice chancellor for 
research and graduate studies. Ramsay and Sypherd were both unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith came to UCI after seven years in Indiana as head of Purdue University's 
department of biological sciences. He has a bachelor's degree in zoology and 
chemistry and a Ph.D. in experimental embryology, both from Indiana University. 
He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences' committees on space science 
and space biology and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
At Purdue, Smith had a track record of being "fairly decent and sensitive" to 
black faculty and students, according to a prominent black official at UCI. But 
he and women faculty said Smith has been criticized for hiring too few 
minorities and women at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, however, noted that this year alone two black professors are joining the 
biological sciences department under a special affirmative action program. 
</P>
<P>
Even critics say that much of the concern stems less from Smith's track record 
than the symbol of having another white male in UCI's second most powerful 
position, one that sets academic policy as well as makes the all important 
hiring and recruitment decisions. With few exceptions, the top ranking 
administrators are white males at UCI, which last fall became the first UC 
campus to have a freshman class composed of more than 50% minority students. 
</P>
<P>
"The women and minorities on campus had hoped we would have an executive vice 
chancellor who would symbolize the more diverse academic community we are 
trying to develop at UCI," said one faculty member. "The real concern . . . is 
about a lack of commitment."

Thousands of Indochinese "boat people" face grave peril if Southeast Asian 
countries, exhausted by waves of refugees, make good on threats to begin 
refusing new arrivals next month, refugee advocates warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a solution is reached, flimsy boats filled with desperate asylum seekers 
may be pushed back into the sea, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Towing people out to sea into pirate-infested waters and saying 'good luck' is 
a totally unacceptable way to treat people seeking asylum," said Lionel 
Rosenblatt, president of the Washington-based group Refugees International. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt came to Orange County for strategy meetings Tuesday and Wednesday 
with Vietnamese-American community leaders, including newspaper publishers, 
religious leaders and refugee groups. They plan a campaign to draw attention to 
the plight of their countrymen and to urge the Bush Administration to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most serious crisis since 1979 . . . when hundreds if not 
thousands drowned, and we are about to see a repeat of that unless the U.S. 
takes a leadership role," Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will take advantage of this year's election to put pressure on the 
politicians, congressmen and senators of both parties, to work on our behalf -- 
especially Sen. Pete Wilson," said Nhi Ho, an Orange County Republican Party 
activist. "He is running for governor of California and California has the 
largest (overseas) Vietnamese community in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, more than 1 million boat people have sought asylum in Malaysia, 
Indonesia, Hong Kong, and other Southeast Asian nations. Under new screening 
procedures, many are deemed to have fled for economic reasons and are refused 
refugee status. Hong Kong's decision to send 51 such boat people back to 
Vietnam in December triggered an international outcry. But no permanent 
solution for their resettlement has been found. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Southeast Asian countries and Hong Kong threatened to stop offering 
new arrivals temporary refuge starting July 1. They have demanded that the 
United States and Britain either agree to force the boat people to return to 
Vietnam, or set up and pay for a temporary holding center on U.S. or British 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials say Malaysia already has begun to push back seaborne 
asylum-seekers, four of whom have died. Washington has vigorously protested 
Malaysia's actions, calling it a breach of international agreements. More than 
8,300 boat people have made their way to Indonesia this year after being 
rebuffed by Malaysia, but there are no estimates of how many others may have 
drowned or fallen victim to Thai pirates, Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
"By definition, when whole boats go down, there isn't any evidence; so we're 
afraid that there are many more tragedies than the four deaths we know about," 
he said.

In a related development, the Philippines has refused to admit 101 Vietnamese 
boat people who were rescued on the South China Sea and have been stranded 
aboard a U.S. Navy supply ship in Subic Bay for two weeks, the Washington Post 
reported this week. Citing the 25,000 refugees already in the Philippines, 
officials there said they will no longer allow U.S. vessels to leave refugees 
on their shores without a guarantee that they will be resettled elsewhere 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an empathy fatigue for refugees," said Mai Cong, chairman of the 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a social services agency. "However, 
I strongly believe that as a country who wants to see freedom for everyone, we 
shouldn't turn our back." 
</P>
<P>
Cong and Nhiem, who have each been active in opposing forced repatriation, said 
they would organize letter-writing campaigns, petitions or demonstrations to 
draw attention to the latest threat. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at what we can do to help," Cong said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 Asian-American groups from across the nation are also purchasing a 
Washington newspaper advertisement this week urging President Bush to act 
before the July 1 deadline. Among the backers, Rosenblatt said, are the Boat 
People SOS Committee in San Diego, Project Ngoc of Irvine, the Vietnamese 
Community of Southern California Inc. and the Council for Refugee Rights in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese-American community is going to have to come of age politically 
if we are to get action on this," Rosenblatt said. "Their compatriots' lives 
are at risk and we want them to use all of their political clout and economic 
muscle." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster newspaper publisher Yen Do signed the ad and pledged his support to 
the campaign Tuesday. But the publisher of Nguoi Viet said he doubted that 
Asian-Americans could budge an administration that has rejected the idea of a 
holding center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the U.S. government doesn't want to be tied diplomatically to any 
further measures in Southeast Asia," Do said. But, he noted, "forced 
repatriation in Hong Kong produced a huge reaction around the world, and I 
think the same thing will happen when the Southeast Asian countries begin 
pushing the people away." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt said he also hopes the educational campaign will persuade 
California's Vietnamese-American citizens to write their friends and relatives 
back home and urge them not to attempt to flee Vietnam by boat. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings in the Vietnamese press have apparently had little effect, he said. 
Refugees he met six weeks ago in camps in Malaysia and Indonesia told him that 
they would not have attempted the trip had they understood the dangers of the 
ocean crossing and the stricter criteria for resettlement in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the Vietnamese have also been joined by a new stream of Cambodian boat 
people, who do not meet the international criteria for refugee status. 
Rosenblatt said there are unconfirmed reports that among the Cambodians who 
have fled by boat are low- or mid-level officials in the Vietnamese-backed Hun 
Sen government. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said the 
commissioner leaves today for visits to Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and the 
Philippines, where he will discuss the asylum issue. 
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the commissioner hoped the impasse could be 
resolved at a meeting of the steering committee of the international conference 
on Indochinese refugees scheduled to take place in Geneva late this month or 
early in July.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paula Michaud, a 37-year-old single mother, works part time and takes a full 
load of college courses in addition to raising two sons in a one-bedroom 
Huntington Beach apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Covering the rent, she says, consumes 90% of her monthly income, a meager 
combination of a welfare check and some take-home pay from a clerical job. She 
cannot afford to own a car, and paying for such basic necessities as food and 
child care is a month-to-month struggle. 
</P>
<P>
But to Michaud, her present living situation is "a dream come true." Though her 
apartment is modest and her budget remains tight, it certainly beats life in a 
homeless shelter. That's where Michaud and her boys spent last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Like hundreds of other single parents throughout Orange County, Michaud has 
scratched her way from rock bottom to a slightly higher perch, nudged upward by 
undaunting determination and a dose of luck. 
</P>
<P>
But she and hundreds of others throughout Orange County have had help along the 
way. A network of public and private organizations throughout the county aid 
single parents toeing the economic edge, providing everything from job training 
to housing assistance to loans for bus fares. And many single parents say they 
are climbing above the poverty line and into the mainstream as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Even as opportunities have improved for the county's welfare mothers -- and a 
smattering of welfare fathers -- to wriggle loose from the grip of poverty, 
many experts say the available services remain woefully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
And that shortfall of services may only get worse as the number of 
single-parent families continues to rise. More than half of U.S. children born 
today will live in single-parent homes before their 18th birthday, according to 
a May 1989 Ford Foundation study. 
</P>
<P>
With single parents finding it increasingly difficult to juggle work, child 
care and, in some cases, educational endeavors, many of those children will be 
raised in a landscape of poverty. Already, 25% of America's children under age 
6 live in households below the poverty line, the Ford Foundation study said. 
</P>
<P>
A separate study commissioned by the state last year concluded that families 
make up the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population, and most of 
those are headed by a lone parent. 
</P>
<P>
"From all indications," says Carol Runzel, coordinator of Huntington Beach 
Project Self-Sufficiency, a city-staffed, federally funded program that aids 
single-parent families, "the new poor in this country will be the nation's 
women and children. I find that appalling." 
</P>
<P>
But efforts such as Project Self-Sufficiency are helping to ease the problems 
of single parents burdened by poverty and welfare dependency, at least in the 
northeast corner of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1985, Project Self-Sufficiency provides housing aid for single 
parents who live in or around Huntington Beach. The agency originally offered 
rental assistance for just 25 individuals, but today it provides housing help 
to 121 single-parent families. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most vital component of the project is its link with an intricate 
network of public agencies, local churches and other private organizations that 
provide a kaleidoscope of services, including free or low-cost child care, 
donations of food, clothes and furniture, job training and loans to cover the 
month's utilities or pay for car repairs. 
</P>
<P>
A key element of that network is Golden West College's single-parent assistance 
program, formed last fall through its financial aid office. Through an 
intensive recruiting effort, the office, which a year ago served just a handful 
of students who are single parents, now provides aid for 90 of them, says Karen 
Hinton, coordinator of the new program. 
</P>
<P>
She says 176 single parents now receive educational, financial and emotional 
counseling from the program. 
</P>
<P>
Michaud credits Hinton's program for paving the way for her to realize a 
lifelong ambition in September, when she enrolled in her first college courses 
at Golden West, which she hopes will eventually lead to a teaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"When I met Karen," Michaud says, "and she said to me, 'Let's go downstairs and 
sign you up for classes,' I couldn't believe it. It's hard to put into words 
what you feel when a dream comes true." 
</P>
<P>
Sabrina Scotch, 30 -- a high school dropout and mother of a 9-year-old girl -- 
is in her second semester at Golden West, maintaining a 4.0 grade-point 
average. After years of shuffling from one living arrangement to another, 
Scotch moved into a comfortable, two-bedroom apartment in August with aid from 
Project Self-Sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Alerted by the agency, local churches have donated furniture to furnish her new 
place and have brought Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners to her door. The 
program has also given her emotional support, helping to reverse her sinking 
self-esteem, Scotch says. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Project Self-Sufficiency and the Golden West (financial-aid) office, 
there's no way I'd be where I am now," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Several "graduates" of the program have moved on to full-time careers or 
four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
But the Huntington Beach program is the only city-sponsored effort of its kind 
in the county. Garden Grove also participated in the original Project 
Self-Sufficiency pilot program, funded initially through the federal Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, but it collapsed in 1987 because the city 
lacked the type of services network that has sustained Huntington Beach's 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The only comparable aid available for single parents in the rest of the county 
is on community college campuses, all of which offer a limited number of grants 
through their financial aid offices. Several also have programs targeting 
single parents. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton and Rancho Santiago colleges last year adopted a state-funded program 
that provides about 50 single-parent students on each campus with grants to 
defray the costs of child care, tuition, tutoring, books and other school 
supplies. Rancho Santiago this month also just formed an on-campus support club 
for single parents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast College features a similar club, as well as the only campus 
child-care center in the county that accepts infants younger than 2. During the 
past year, the college has also expanded its women's re-entry center, holding 
information and support workshops that often address issues of particular 
concern to single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress College offers 15 child-care grants each semester and recently set up a 
federally funded career-guidance and support program exclusively for single 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Coastline Community College's financial-aid office is linked with Project 
Self-Sufficiency and an array of service organizations throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton each provide child care and programs to help 
women re-enter the work force. Fullerton has a single child-care center, while 
Irvine tends to nearly 600 children of students and staff members at its six 
centers and newly opened on-campus preschool. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the college services help just a slice of the county's 
single-parent population, county social workers say. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the single parents on welfare do not attend school, says Dee 
Lacey, a case worker for Greater Avenues for Independence, a government program 
that offers help to welfare parents. 
</P>
<P>
Several welfare recipients called Greater Avenues for Independence just another 
tangled web of bureaucracy. But Lacey, a 10-year veteran of social work, calls 
it the first government program that genuinely aims to help parents shed the 
straitjacket of welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by state and federal funds, it provides welfare parents of children 
older than age 3 with job training and financial aid for child care, 
transportation and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
But gaping holes remain in the safety net for needy single parents, many 
current and former welfare dependents say. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see things as moving in a positive direction at all," says a 
40-year-old Los Alamitos single mother who was once dependent on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"I see people helping, like Project Self-Sufficiency. . . . But things are just 
not that different for single parents. There are a lot of women out there who 
are still struggling."

TITANS' BORGOGNO FORGOES SENIOR SEASON TO SIGN WITH GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton second baseman Mate Borgogno signed with the San Francisco 
Giants Tuesday and will report tonight to the team's Class-A affiliate in 
Everett, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Also signing with major league teams Tuesday were Brent Bish, a former 
two-sport standout at Esperanza High School, with the San Diego Padres and Troy 
Paulsen, a former standout at La Quinta, with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno, an 18th-round draft pick in last week's free agent amateur draft, 
wasn't happy with the team's original offer and had considered returning to 
Fullerton for his senior season. But a meeting Tuesday morning with a team 
official made his decision a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk money matters, but they doubled their original offer and 
I'm happy with that," Borgogno said. "I loved playing at Fullerton, but once 
they came up with the money, it wasn't a hard decision." 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno, a left-handed hitter, was the Titans' second-leading hitter with a 
.376 average, and he had 16 doubles, 44 runs scored and a team-high 54 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
He also was one of the main reasons Fullerton went from a poor defensive team 
in 1989 to what Coach Larry Cochell called "the best infield I've had in 24 
years." After committing 29 errors in 1989, most of them at shortstop, Borgogno 
made only nine errors this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bish, a junior shortstop at Cal State Los Angeles, was drafted in the 16th 
round and will report Thursday to the Padres' Class-A team in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Bish was The Times' player of the year in soccer and the starting third baseman 
on the Esperanza baseball team that reached the 1987 Southern Section 5-A 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Bish becomes the third infielder from that Esperanza team to sign professional 
contracts, joining Tom Redington (Atlanta Braves) and Doug Saunders (New York 
Mets) in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen, a second baseman for Stanford, will report to the Phillies' 
instructional team in Clearwater, Fla. Paulsen was named to the all-tournament 
team at the recent College World Series.

GIRL SAFE AFTER KIDNAPING IN HER MOTHER'S STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old girl kidnaped while she slept on the back seat of a car stolen 
from her mother knocked on an apartment door this morning in South-Central Los 
Angeles, eight hours after she was reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
Lanesha Lynn Thomas told police that she awoke about 8 a.m. in the car, which 
the thieves had abandoned on West 75th Street, Inglewood Police Officer Calvin 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who answered the door at the nearby apartment fed the little girl 
breakfast while she waited for officers to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The girl and her mother, Katherine Toney, 26, were reunited at the Inglewood 
Police Station. 
</P>
<P>
Toney told police she was driving through Inglewood shortly after midnight when 
the driver of a black Nissan lightly bumped her car near the intersection of 
Century Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Toney followed the car until it stopped on a side street. When she walked to 
the back of her car to survey the damage, the passenger in the Nissan jumped 
into her car and sped away with Lanesha. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's grandmother, Judy Wilson, said she waited hours by the telephone for 
word from police while Toney scoured the area looking for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects and only general descriptions of the driver and 
passenger. Both were teen-agers. One had long, curly hair and acne scars and 
was wearing a black-and-white checkered shirt and black pants. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said Toney's car was not damaged and Lanesha was not hurt.

JUVENILE HALL REFORMS ORDERED; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE IN OC LIMITS USE OF RESTRAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Calling for better treatment of youngsters confined at Juvenile Hall, a 
Superior Court judge found today that errant teens are thrown into padded rooms 
or cuffed to metal-frame beds without proper care and supervision, and the 
judge imposed strict new guidelines for such punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin concluded that the 
current practice of subjecting unruly teens to leather-cuff restraints or 
placing them in "rubber rooms" violates their constitutional right to be free 
from bodily restraint because it is ordered by unqualified staffers and 
undertaken with inadequate medical supervision. 
</P>
<P>
In a written decision issued after a five-week civil rights trial, McLaughlin 
acknowledged that restraints were generally used only when minors posed a 
danger to themselves or those around them. But she also ruled that the 
potential psychological and physical injury that could come from putting a 
youth in restraints calls for the intervention of a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin ordered the county to obtain a psychiatrist's approval before 
cuffing detainees to beds or locking them in "rubber rooms." If such approval 
cannot be quickly obtained and it is a "clear emergency," the decision to 
restrain a youth may be made by Juvenile Hall staff members, but only those who 
have been certified by a psychiatrist as trained and qualified to make such a 
decision, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Once an adolescent is in cuffs or a rubber room, a nurse must supervise and 
keep records of the entire incident, McLaughlin ordered. Within five days of 
the youth's release from restraints, a psychiatrist must review all records of 
the incident and submit a written approval of the way it was handled, 
McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and San Francisco's Youth Law 
Center, who brought the lawsuit, deferred comment until they had a chance to 
read McLaughlin's 49-page decision. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin's decision also gave the civil-rights lawyers one other victory: She 
agreed that Juvenile Hall's procedure restricting attorney access to detainees 
is unconstitutionally vague and must be rewritten. That procedure requires a 
lawyer who wishes to see a detainee to get permission from the youth's Juvenile 
Court-appointed attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But McLaughlin handed the plaintiffs' lawyers a string of defeats on a host of 
more minor challenges to other Juvenile Hall practices. She said there was 
nothing unconstitutional about the way youths were sent to their rooms when 
they misbehaved or the kind of access they were given to legal materials on 
request. She also saw no problems with the reading and censoring of the youths' 
mail, the monitoring of their visits and phone calls or the restrictions on the 
kinds of reading materials they were permitted to have. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin agreed that the Hall frequently exceeded its rated 314-person 
capacity, but said that overcrowding did not rise to the level of a 
constitutional violation because the basic needs of the minors are still being 
met. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs had also complained that youths are disciplined without adequate 
grievance or due-process procedures and that they are given insufficient access 
to toilets or outdoor exercise, but McLaughlin said she disagreed.

A divided House subcommittee pushed a constitutional amendment against flag 
desecration toward the House floor today with a recommendation that it be 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the House Judiciary 
Committee, a panel dominated by five veteran Democratic liberals, voted 5 to 3 
to tell the full committee that the brief amendment should be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The full committee next Tuesday is expected to send the amendment out to the 
House floor for a vote that could come late next week. Subcommittee Chairman 
Don Edwards (D-San Jose) predicted a close vote. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after voting to report the amendment to the full committee 
"adversely," the committee voted 6 to 2 for a resolution condemning flag 
burning and reaffirming the values protected by the Bill of Rights, a proposal 
senior panel Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin labeled as a "patent 
attempt to provide political cover for people who for one reason or another 
oppose the constitutional amendment."

<P>
ADN said Inge Viett, 46, was arrested late Tuesday in the East German city of 
Magdeburg. 
</P>
<P>
She is accused of taking part in the murder of prominent West Berlin Judge 
Guenter von Drenkmann in 1974 and the kidnaping a year later of West Berlin 
Christian Democratic leader Peter Lorenz. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, West German wanted posters appeared in Magdeburg, with names

<TEXT>
<P>
Black candidates made political gains in South Carolina and Arkansas as they 
captured major party nominations for governor and lieutenant governor, figures 
showed today. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Theo Mitchell won the Democratic nomination for South Carolina 
governor Tuesday, becoming the first black candidate nominated by a major party 
for statewide office in South Carolina since Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell garnered 60% of the vote to defeat his opponent, fellow state Sen. 
Ernie Passailaigue, for the right to challenge Gov. Carroll Campbell in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, a Republican elected in 1986, was unopposed in the GOP primary. He is 
expected to be a heavy favorite in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
In the state's Senate race, there was no opposition for Republican Sen. Strom 
Thurmond. Democrats had no candidate. 
</P>

Socialite and businesswoman Georgette Mos bacher, whose name is a familiar 
fixture in columns that chronicle New York's rich and famous, made the police 
blotter today after she was robbed at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old wife of Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher ran into a 
well-dressed Uzi-toting thief in the plush halls of the Barbizon hotel on 
Manhattan's Upper East Side Tuesday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, widely touted as one of the most glamorous figures in the Bush 
Administration, told the Daily News that she refused the gunman's demand that 
she open the door to her room and go inside with him. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she said she gave him the jewelry she was wearing -- worth about 
$30,000 -- and some personal papers. Then, as the gunman's hands were full, an 
elevator door opened and, Mosbacher said, she dived in, "screaming and yelling 
and leaning" on the emergency buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby 20 floors down, she alerted the hotel staff. The gunman was long 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hell," Mosbacher told the newspaper. "I'm lucky to be talking to you. 
It's amazing at the moment when it was happening how calm I was. I remember 
when I was bitten by a snake in Texas, and I went absolutely berserk. This time 
I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, owner of La Prairie, a women's cosmetics firm headquartered in 
Switzerland whose products are sold in exclusive department stores, said that 
during the confrontation, the well-dressed gunman poked a submachine gun at her 
and whispered, "Open your door." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'The door won't open, the key won't work.' He opened the door, and I 
told him, 'I'm not going in there. I'm not going to shout.' 
</P>
<P>
"I took off my earrings and said, 'There's a bench over there and I'm going to 
sit.' I said to myself, 'I'm not going to live,' but I thought I'd have a 
better chance in the hallway," Mosbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things she did after the ordeal was "order a stiff drink" and 
call her husband in Washington, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher was staying at the hotel while the couple's upper Fifth Avenue 
cooperative apartment is being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
The Barbizon, once a fashionable women's hotel and residence, is owned by a 
corporation formed by the one-time owners of Studio 54.

The owners of a stranded communications satellite today said they will pay NASA 
for a shuttle rescue mission with spacewalking astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
Intelsat's board of governors authorized the rescue effort, which will cost 
millions of dollars, during a weeklong meeting in Barbados that ended today. 
</P>
<P>
The uninsured $157-million satellite is orbiting uselessly about 345 miles up. 
It ended up 22,000 miles lower than intended when it failed to separate 
properly from a Titan 3 rocket March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Corp., which conducted the $272-million commercial launch, 
blamed an engineering design error in the rocket. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration last month said it would send 
up a shuttle to rescue the Intelsat VI satellite if Intelsat paid for it.

The use of improper bolts probably caused a cockpit windshield to blow out of a 
British Airways plane at 23,000 feet during the weekend, almost sucking the 
pilot out of the aircraft, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators have determined that of the 90 bolts used to retain the 
windscreen, 84 were of an incorrect size for the captive nuts into which they 
were installed," a Civil Aviation Authority official said. 
</P>
<P>
"This explains the windscreen's blowing out when exposed to the cabin pressure 
during the climb." 
</P>
<P>
Officials reported the incorrect bolts were 1.5 inches in diameter, 1/32 of an 
inch smaller than they should have been. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways said it has suspended the engineer responsible for fitting the 
bolts, pending completion of the inquiry by government investigators.

President Corazon Aquino today signed a bill banning the "pernicious trade" in 
mail-order brides, which she said insults national pride and breaks the hearts 
of young women and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino hailed the new law's prohibition of the "commerce in women under the 
guise of legitimate marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The measure outlaws the "solicitation or inducement" of Filipino women to 
become members of any club or association whose objective is to match women for 
marriage to foreign nationals -- either on a mail-order basis or through 
personal introductions for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ernesto Maceda, sponsor of the new law, said he was spurred to action by 
the "alarming rate" of battered Filipino wives married to foreign nationals 
through the mail-order bride business. 
</P>
<P>
Any foreigner convicted under the new law faces the same fine and jail time, 
plus deportation.

U.S. WARNED ON FOREIGN INVESTMENTS

The federal government must keep closer watch on foreign investment in this 
country, backers of legislation to let federal agencies share data on investors 
told a House panel today. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have the right to know what foreign interests are buying up our 
country," said Rep. Doug Walgren (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee's subcommittee on commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the United States nearly quadrupled during the last 
decade, from $500 billion in 1980 to nearly $1.8 trillion in 1988, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When a foreign investor buys a U.S. firm it often means U.S. technology is 
transferred abroad," Walgren said during a subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is considering an Administration bill to give the Commerce 
Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis access to Census Bureau data on 
foreign-owned U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce keeps data only on each foreign investor as a whole, while the Census 
has information on each location that is owned by foreign interests. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Norman F. Lent (R-N.Y.), a co-sponsor of the Administration-backed bill, 
noted that foreign investment brings substantial benefits, "the most important 
being 3.2 million jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.), also a co-sponsor, said the government now has "an 
incomplete and distorted picture" of the extent of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"I have repeatedly expressed my concern about America's growing dependence on 
foreign capital," Exon said. "At risk is America's economic independence." 
</P>
<P>
A broader proposal by Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.) also would give Commerce 
access to data from other agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service. 
However, the Administration contends that it could allow confidential business 
records to be publicly disclosed and would thus discourage foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) contended, however, that the Sharp measure would 
protect confidential information and that it would require no new information 
to be given to the government.

The stock market sustained some scattered losses today after making a 
short-lived run at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 10 points at its afternoon 
peak, closed with a 3.72 loss at 2,929.70. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 711 up, 774 down and 507 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 158.91 million shares, against 157.10 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell .66 to 199.00. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported this morning that retail sales fell 0.7% in 
May, registering a sharper decline than most analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
That evidence of continued softness in business activity helped push interest 
rates lower in the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $7.50 for each $1,000 in face 
value, lowering their yields to the 8.38%-8.41% range. 
</P>
<P>
But stock traders didn't show such clear-cut enthusiasm over the news. Analysts 
said investors were a little unsettled by signs that consumer spending was 
slipping at a time when economic growth appears to be sluggish at best. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, traders appeared reluctant to chase after stocks in advance of 
government reports Thursday and Friday on consumer and producer prices. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose between 1/8 point and 9/32 point, intermediate maturities rose between 
5/16 point and 15/32 point and long-term issues were up 5/8 point to 11/16 
point, according to the Telerate financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.94% as the discount fell 4 basis 
points to 7.69%.

MIDOL PAYING $375,000 TO SETTLE CASE OVER AD CLAIMS

The nation's largest manufacturer of over-the-counter menstrual relief medicine 
must pay $375,000 to settle charges that it made unsubstantiated advertising 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Drug Inc. reached agreement Tuesday with the Federal Trade Commission 
concerning a 1985 complaint that eventually encompassed advertising for all but 
one of the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement "is without admission of any wrongdoing," said Terry Kelley, 
spokesman for Sterling Drug Inc., which makes Midol brand products. 
</P>
<P>
"Sterling will continue to manufacture and market the Midol brand products," he 
said, adding that all the questionable ads were halted by March. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC said Sterling had violated a 1985 order prohibiting product performance 
claims unless a company has "competent and reliable evidence for those claims." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said Sterling ran certain ads for Original Formula Midol and 
Maximum Strength Midol for Cramps from March, 1985, to January, 1986, and in 
April, 1988, that claimed or implied one of the ingredients was a muscle 
relaxant for menstrual cramps that would quickly help relieve muscle 
contractions. 
</P>
<P>
"The ingredient in question has been removed from the product," according to 
Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
Also cited were ads for Maximum Strength Midol PMS which claimed "total" or 
"complete relief" for the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC also said the company had no scientific evidence that Original Midol 
Multi-Symptom Formula and Maximum Strength Midol Multi-Symptom Formula relieved 
menstrual water-weight gain.

The Philippine government wants to sell part of the national airline to a major 
foreign investor before listing the company's shares on the local stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Feliciano Belmonte, general manager of the Government Service Insurance System, 
which owns 75% of Philippine Airlines, told reporters he would like to see a 
foreign airline take equity in the national carrier. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was scouting for a group that would buy into the airline but 
declined to name companies that have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said British Airways is among them. 
</P>
<P>
Belmonte said he expects the privatization of the airline by next year but gave 
no date for the public offer. 
</P>
<P>
It is among about 300 government properties due for transfer to private hands 
under President Corazon Aquino's privatization program.

Police warned record stores Tuesday to stop selling the controversial album "As 
Nasty As They Wanna Be" by rap group 2 Live Crew or face possible obscenity 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no prior restraint. 
</P>
<P>
We're just asking for voluntary compliance," said Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander 
of the vice squad. 
</P>
<P>
In about five days, police will begin conducting undercover investigations and 
arresting anyone still selling the album, Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, when something like that occurs, the clerk that sells the 
record is often the one that gets arrested," he said. "I don't think the 
business owners want that." 
</P>
<P>
Pittman said Bexar County Assistant Dist. Atty. Mike Schill reviewed 
transcripts of the album lyrics and listened to them on tape before determining 
that some words violate state obscenity law. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida last week, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled material on the 
album obscene under that state's law. On Sunday, two 2 Live Crew members were 
arrested on obscenity charges after performing the banned lyrics.

Comedian Jackie Mason has been ordered to pay his former Florida girlfriend 
$2,000 per month in child support, marking the end of a bitter three-year 
paternity lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
A Florida court of appeals late Tuesday upheld the monthly paternity award 
retroactive to the Dec. 15, 1985, birth of Ginger Reiter's daughter, Sheeba. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that Mason, a comedian who starred in last year's television 
series "Chicken Soup," could better pay for the child's support than Reiter, 
37, who operates a singing telegram service.

In what has become an annual field trip to Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor 
extends an open invitation to radio listeners to "A Prairie Home Companion: The 
4th Annual Farewell Performance." 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Minnesota Public Radio in conjunction with KSUI-FM in Iowa City, 
the show will be broadcast live Saturday from the University of Iowa on 
American Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
This "4th Annual Farewell" stems from a tradition started on June 13, 1987, 
when Keillor gave his final live performance from the World Theater in St. 
Paul, Minn. Audience response prompted Keillor to return for a "Second 
Farewell" at New York's Radio City Music Hall in June, 1988, and then a third 
in Los Angeles in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Keillor are Jean Redpath, a Scottish folk singer; mandolinist and 
fiddler Peter Ostroushko; and singer Greg Brown.

The British government has granted Soviet dancer Irek Mukhamedov a "leave to 
remain" in Britain after he resigned from the Bolshoi Ballet and joined 
Britain's Royal Ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
Reports today called the move the first major artistic defection of the 
glasnost era. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet performer, who critics have hailed as the world's most exciting 
dancer, arrived in Britain on June 3 to discuss his upcoming work as guest 
artist with the Royal Ballet for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Ballet spokeswoman Amanda Jones said that, after a meeting Tuesday, 
Mukhamedov sent a telex to the Bolshoi Ballet announcing his resignation, 
signed a five-year contract with the British company, and went out with his 
pregnant wife to look for an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major coup for us," she said. "We have a number of principal dancers, 
of which he will be one." 
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper said the dancer had "effected the first artistic 
defection of the glasnost era," the liberalization of Soviet society under 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The rather businesslike manner of Mukhamedov's taking up residence in Britain 
was in marked contrast to the defection of Rudolf Nureyev, who in 1961, as the 
last Soviet dancer to join the Royal Ballet, approached a police officer in 
Paris and asked for protection from two men nearby he said were KGB agents. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said no response had yet come from the Bolshoi company, which the 
Independent said "may now begin to have mixed feelings about the thaw in 
international relations."

SHEEN JOINS FOLGERS BOYCOTT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Martin Sheen urged a supermarket chain to boycott Folgers coffee to 
persuade Procter &amp; Gamble to stop buying beans from war-torn El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen joined a demonstration in Beverly Hills Tuesday by about three dozen 
people outside a shareholders meeting of the Arden supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott was started in November by peace organizations to protest the 
slayings in El Salvador of six Jesuit priests. Salvadoran military officers 
have been implicated in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
"My country should not be funding the killers of the Jesuit priests with our 
tax dollars or our consumer dollars," Sheen said. 
</P>
<P>
An Arden spokesman, Ernest Klinger, said the company would continue to stock 
Folgers to give consumers a full selection. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tassone of P&amp;G, which makes Folgers, called the boycott "preposterous." 
He said that P&amp;G buys coffee from at least 30 countries and that the 
Salvadoran product amounts to less than 2% of the coffee in Folgers.

LIZ SMITH: CAN ALL THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY TRIP UP TRUMP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"TRUMP IS the victim of his own peculiar naivete about the way life works. 
Couldn't he see what all of his shameless self-promotion was setting him up 
for? Schadenfreude -- a German word for glee over the misfortune of others -- 
is actually as American as casino gambling," writes Jonathan Alter in the 
current Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts come under Alter's heading "The Fame Game: Why Everyone's 
Gloating," in the magazine's cover story, "Trump: The Fall." 
</P>
<P>
IT IS in this issue that Donald Trump is quoted, saying: "Negative publicity 
has no effect in my life." 
</P>
<P>
If this is true, then Donald is in a class by himself. Negative publicity 
almost always takes its toll, however, in psychic distress if nowhere else. But 
then, matters tend to settle, so that the public makes final perceptions and 
summings-up of high profile people that usually are pretty much correct. 
</P>
<P>
The function of the press, with all its hits and errors, is to add to this 
ability of people in general to draw fairly accurate conclusions. And, as 
Americans are more prone to be fair than to be unfair, somehow most stories 
work out on the fair side. 
</P>
<P>
I SUPPOSE the press can't be blamed too much for falling for that elaborate and 
absurd hoax about Elizabeth Taylor's 23-year-old "new love." But anybody who 
has ever dealt with Taylor's formidable press rep, Chen Sam, immediately 
recognized this story as a fake. Never in a million years would Chen (or anyone 
working for her) dare to talk of Elizabeth's "depression" or of her intimate 
affairs. They particularly wouldn't make those National Enquirer-type quotes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, bamboo shoots under the fingernails couldn't make Chen Sam, a woman 
with a rather blind-sided view of what constitutes her job, even tell you what 
color dress Elizabeth Taylor is wearing! 
</P>

KANIN GAININ' on marryin' Marian! Garson Kanin, the famous 
screenwriter-playwright-director par excellence, was wed for many happy years

</P>
<P>
Since Ruth's death several years ago, Kanin has been keeping company with 
Broadway's most enduring actress, Marian Seldes. (She has appeared in two of 
the Great White Way's longest-running hits, "Equus" and "Deathtrap," and is 
currently in Chester, Conn., with the out-of-town "Annie II.") 
</P>
<P>
Now Kanin and Seldes plan to tie the knot on June 19 in New York City. It 
couldn't happen to a nicer couple.

<P>
Erin Fleming, one-time companion of the late comedian Groucho Marx, was 
arrested after walking into a sheriff's station with a loaded .357 Magnum 
revolver in her purse, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, 48, walked into the West Hollywood sheriff's station at 720 N. San 
Vicente Blvd. carrying a large handbag at about 11 p.m. Tuesday, sheriff's 
Deputy Chris Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
"As she spoke with station deputies, she placed the handbag on the counter," 
Wahla said. "Visible within the handbag was a 2 1/2-inch stainless steel 
revolver which, after inspection, was found to be loaded." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming was arrested on suspicion of carrying a concealed loaded firearm in a 
public place. She was released on her promise to appear in Beverly Hills 
Municipal Court for arraignment July 6. 
</P>
<P>
"A computer check revealed that the handgun was registered to her," Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming was a companion to the late comedian Groucho Marx and was a beneficiary 
of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies would not say why Fleming went to the station.

MORGAN'S 3-GAME SUSPENSION UPHELD; GLOATED OVER BEAN BALL

<P>
American League President Bobby Brown today upheld his three-game suspension of 
Boston Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was suspended after gloating about Roger Clemens hitting Cleveland's 
Stanley Jefferson with a pitch June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens opened the bottom of the first inning by drilling Jefferson with a 
fastball, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred the day after Indians reliever Doug Jones threw a pitch 
near the head of Tony Pena. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it. We got even, didn't we?" Morgan said after the June 3 game. "We 
voted as a team 34-0 that it would be such." 
</P>
<P>
Brown suspended Morgan on June 5 for those remarks and "circumstances," but the 
Boston manager appealed and had a hearing in New York on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension takes effect beginning with tonight's Red Sox-Yankees game in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Third base Coach Rac Slider will manage the team in Morgan's absence.

The United States' 5-1 loss to Czechoslovakia in its World Cup opener Sunday 
was watched by fewer than 2% of the nation's television viewers. 
</P>
<P>
The match, which began at 8 a.m. PDT, got a 1.8 overnight rating and a 6 share, 
Turner Broadcasting Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Saturday's game between Italy and Austria got a 74 share in Italy, 
the RAI network said. 
</P>
<P>
A rating point is said by A. C.Nielsen Co. to represent 921,000 homes, or 1% of 
the 92.1 million U.S. households that have TV. The share is the percentage of 
television sets that are on at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup games are on Turner Broadcasting's TNT cable network in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The overnight ratings are based on survey's of the largest U.S. television 
markets. The final national ratings will not be available until the end of the 
week.

U.S. TEAM REALISTIC AS IT FACES GAME WITH ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TIRRENIA, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though they may walk into the Valley of Death. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Having had their eyes opened in their opening World Cup game, a 5-1 loss to 
Czechoslovakia, most of the U.S. soccer players have no illusions about their 
chances Thursday against the tournament favorite, Italy, before an anticipated 
sellout crowd of 72,303 at Rome's Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They can hardly take issue with the predictions in the Italian press of a 
goleada. Roughly translated, that means there may be a blackout in Rome because 
of all the electricity that will be consumed by the Italian side of the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
In his column for Il Messagero, Giorgio Chinaglia, a former Italian national 
team member who finished his career with the New York Cosmos, said the game 
against the United States will provide an "occasion to dance" for the Italian 
forwards, Giannini Vialli, Andrea Carnevale and Salvatore Schillaci. 
</P>
<P>
The world press concurs. 
</P>
<P>
London Daily Mail columnist Ian Woolridge wrote, "(The Americans) lost to 
Czechoslovakia by only 5-1, thus inspiring hope that they may possibly be able 
to confine Italy to a dozen goals or fewer." 
</P>
<P>
History would suggest fewer. The United States played Italy to a scoreless tie 
in 1984 in the Meadowlands. In the three other games between the two teams, 
Italy won by only 7-1 in 1934, 9-0 in 1948 and 10-0 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Carnevale said that a 3-0 victory would satisfy him, but the Italians need a 
more conclusive victory because goal differential is important in determining 
rankings within the six groups. To gain the advantage in Group A, Italy needs 
to beat the United States by one more goal than the Czechs did. 
</P>
<P>
One factor in the United States' favor is that Italy has scored more than four 
goals in a game only eight times in the last 20 years. In one five-game stretch 
this year, the team went 473 minutes without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the field, the Italians have not allowed a goal in 653 
minutes, including last Saturday's 1-0 victory over Austria. Any goal for the 
United States would be considered a remarkable achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"What would you consider a good result?" an Italian journalist asked U.S. Coach 
Bob Gansler this week. "12-0, 10-0, 7-0 or 5-0?" 
</P>
<P>
"How do you expect me to answer that?" an exasperated Gansler said. "Next 
question." 
</P>
<P>
The journalist later tried the question on combative midfielder John Harkes. 
</P>
<P>
He responded that a good result would be "a tie or a win." 
</P>
<P>
The speechless journalist looked at Harkes as if he had just announced that he 
was the man in the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"A tie or a win," Harkes repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," Harkes added, "if we do lose, we want to at least show the Italians we 
can play." 
</P>
<P>
While some of his teammates said they intend to play with more intensity and 
better skill than they did against the Czechs, they seem resigned to their fate 
against Italy. It is like a team of college basketball all-stars facing the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We really did just about as good as we can do against the Czechs," midfielder 
Tab Ramos said. "We were as ready for the game as a team possibly could be. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is going to be more difficult because the Italians are better than 
the Czechs. The first few minutes are going to be difficult to stay composed. 
Then it's only going to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before the World Cup that we might play the best games we've ever 
played and lose them all by 3-0 or 4-0. That's a reality. It's not something 
we're ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler said the players appear to have recovered from their shock after the 
loss to Czechoslovakia. They were so spirited Tuesday that he interrupted 
practice to tell them to save their hard tackles for the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
He has been forced to make one change in the lineup because offensive 
midfielder Eric Wynalda of Westlake Village was automatically suspended for a 
game after receiving a red card against the Czechs. Defender Jimmy Banks is 
likely to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a chance that Gansler will start San Diego State's Marcelo Balboa 
of Cerritos in the midfield for John Stollmeyer and John Doyle of Fremont, 
Calif., as a defender for Steve Trittschuh. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle's assignment would be to man-mark Carnevale, while the team's best 
defender, Desmond Armstrong, will draw Vialli. 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation may be hopeless, the players seem to be looking forward 
to the experience. Goalkeeper Tony Meola has prepared a jersey to give as a 
gift to his Italian counterpart, Walter Zenga. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it as an inspiration to play against the best in the most 
spectacular environment imaginable," midfielder Paul Caligiuri said, sounding 
like a tenor who has been asked to appear at La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the time of my life, and I'm going to make the best of it. I want to step 
up and take the challenge."

Pitching in Greenville, S.C., where he finished 7-7, Tom Lasorda took a wife. 
He married a local woman whose family didn't exactly rejoice bringing into the 
nest of Southern Baptists an Italian Catholic, particularly one with the unique 
personality of Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
Searching their memories, folks in Greenville could never recall encountering 
someone quite like Tom. It suggested the story told by the late husband of 
Debbie Reynolds, Harry Karl, who accompanied his wife on location at a 
backwoods town in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
A villager kept staring at Karl, who, uncomfortable, walked away. The villager 
followed and kept staring. 
</P>
<P>
Harry finally asked, "Is anything wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
The guy answered, "No, I just ain't never seen a Jew before." 
</P>
<P>
In Greenville, the bride's family, not to mention the bride, never had seen 
anyone the likes of Lasorda, whose marriage has now lasted 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tom was an unlikely figure, too, to become manager of the Dodgers after the 
retirement of Walter Alston. The club's owner at the time, Walter O'Malley, 
worried whether Lasorda was mature enough to lead major league players. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley also disliked managers who were kicked out of games, and in the 
minors, Tom usually captured, or contended for, that title. 
</P>
<P>
Managing Spokane, he got kicked out one day before the game even started. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Malley's son, Peter, and Vice President Al Campanis supported Lasorda, 
persuading the owner to try him. 
</P>
<P>
And 14 years later, Lasorda not only remains on the job but has been tendered a 
contract extension of two years. 
</P>
<P>
If he lasts, that would take him to 65, consummating one of baseball's most 
interesting adventures -- a mad odyssey, in fact, in which Tom has soared to 
riches on a rocket of energy and with a fund of inventive ways to get paid. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial empire he has built is astonishing, said to produce revenues 
greater than what he earns as senior manager -- on the same job -- in baseball 
today. 
</P>
<P>
As a public speaker, his fees are high, rarely less than $10,000, and unlike 
his pitchers, he will work every day. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda also does TV and radio commercials. He endorses products. He markets 
spaghetti sauce. This is a fat cat, if you will pardon such reference to one 
enlisting diet powder as a client. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Tom activated his baseball pension, which had reached its maximum 
payout -- $112,000 a year. A millionaire, Lasorda no longer needs the Dodgers, 
or anyone else, but the job continues to offer carbonation, and his dedication 
to selling tickets is unmatched by managers anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda goes through life moving tickets, selling the Dodgers to audiences 
throughout the land. He sells the Dodgers to the press. He sells them to people 
downing their pasta e fagioli in the places in which he eats. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, paisan!" someone yells, spotting Lasorda making his way through the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
This can trigger three minutes from Tom on Dodger Blue. 
</P>
<P>
Some detractors laugh at Lasorda, describing his act as wilted, his appetite 
for a buck insatiable. 
</P>
<P>
But he has traversed a long, hard road from a flat in Norristown, Pa., where he 
slept on the third story, one above where the heat from the coal stove ended. 
</P>
<P>
A scout, minor league manager and big league coach, Tom struggled most of his 
life to pay the tabs, taking on winter work as a manager in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Bagging the job as manager of the Dodgers, he would land, luckily, in 
baseball's least-nervous environs. Walter O'Malley was asked one day why he 
kept Walter Alston for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief," the owner answered, "that if you keep one manager 23 years, 
or hire 23 managers for a year each, your results will be roughly the same. The 
organization usually dictates your place in the standings." 
</P>
<P>
The line of succession in the Dodger front office picks up this philosophy, 
proof of which is Peter O'Malley sticks faithfully with Lasorda, good seasons 
and bad. 
</P>
<P>
And now Tom puts the arm on two more years, at a time he doesn't need it but 
seems to owe it to his Muse to go on. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of prose has been devoted to the celebrity wall Lasorda maintains in his 
office, where autographed photos of the greats appear. 
</P>
<P>
But if he consorts with the Sinatras and the Rickleses and the Iacoccas, he 
never has chosen to live among them, retaining, for all his bankroll, the same 
modest tract house he bought in Fullerton for $27,000 shortly after the Dodgers 
arrived in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is relative," he once explained. "Compared to Beverly Hills, my 
house is humble. But compared to Norristown, it is a palace."

OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Valentine, who played center field for the Angels that night, remembers 
chasing down a fly ball in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
What inning, he's not sure. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers sprinting to the mound at the end, after right fielder Ken Berry 
made the catch that provided the last out. 
</P>
<P>
And he remembers the celebration in the clubhouse afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to provide details, though, Valentine's memory fails. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I got so caught up in the excitement that it's blurred on me," 
Valentine said of the first of Nolan Ryan's six no-hitters, a 3-0 victory over 
the Kansas City Royals on May 15, 1973, at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
But Valentine recalls vividly the young, overpowering Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Should Valentine's memory lag, Ryan provides frequent reminders of his 
greatness, as he did again Monday night at Oakland, allowing the Athletics no 
hits in a 5-0 Texas Ranger victory and becoming, at 43, the oldest player to 
throw a major league no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
According to Valentine, the Ranger manager, little about Ryan has changed in 
the 17 years between the right-hander's first and latest no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"He has more control now, a little less hair, a few more wrinkles," Valentine 
said. "He's not much different otherwise. His windup is almost precisely the 
same. He has a changeup now. He only had a fastball and curveball then, so his 
arsenal is a little different. 
</P>
<P>
"But he still throws it very fast. He still walks down off the hill the same 
way when he misses. He still catches the ball back from the catcher the same 
way. He doesn't quite cover first base as fast as he once did. 
</P>
<P>
"He still works the long, laborious hours of training and conditioning. And 
he's still the same guy from Alvin, Tex., (of whom) everybody used to say, 
'Gee, how could he be such a great guy?' 
</P>
<P>
"So, really, not that much has changed -- remarkably so." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
How has Ryan endured? 
</P>
<P>
As Valentine noted with a laugh, it was said 20 years ago that Ryan threw the 
ball so hard that surely his arm would fall off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key is conditioning," Ryan said during one of many interviews 
conducted Tuesday before and after the Rangers' 6-5 win over the A's. "I've 
been blessed with a good body and maybe the aging process hasn't caught up with 
me as early as it has some other players. 
</P>
<P>
"And, also, I think that concentrating my entire career on proper mechanics is 
paying dividends now." 
</P>
<P>
One of those dividends was throwing a no-hitter in front of the two youngest of 
his three kids, Nolan Reese Ryan, 14, and Wendy, 13. 
</P>
<P>
They flew in from Texas Monday with their mother, Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Reese, who stayed home with his grandmother when Ryan pitched his fifth 
no-hitter for the Houston Astros against the Dodgers in 1981, was in the dugout 
Monday night, at one point massaging his father's back, which has been sore for 
six weeks and will be examined today in Los Angeles by Dr. Lewis Yocum. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the doctor is concerned because (the pain) has been persistent and 
hasn't really improved," Ryan said. "I think he feels like if it was a muscle 
spasm, we would have seen improvement in it." 
</P>
<P>
His son, too, was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"He came over in the seventh and asked me how my back felt and started rubbing 
it," Ryan said. "I think he was nervous and really didn't know what to do with 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Valentine, who positioned himself at the opposite end of the bench, had 
purposely avoided making eye contact with Ryan because he did not want to see 
his pitcher grimace or acknowledge the pain in his back. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted only the good to happen," Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the game, though, he stole a glance toward Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"Reese was on his side, looking up at him, patting him on the leg and rubbing 
his back," Valentine said. "It was a Norman Rockwell scene." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the eighth inning, Reese told his father, "We only need three 
more," and Ryan smiled back at him, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't Reese realized that by acknowledging the no-hitter in the dugout, with 
the game still in progress, he had breached baseball etiquette? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it would matter," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the pain in his back -- Ryan came off the 15-day disabled list only 
last week and told reporters after the game Monday night that he had planned to 
pitch only seven innings -- Ryan was strong at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike 17 years ago, Valentine could only sit and watch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot more of a participatory role (in 1973)," Valentine said. "I was 
sweating and wanted the ball and couldn't wait. It was breaking on every swing, 
yelling. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, it was lot more controlled anxiety, kind of sitting there not being able 
to do anything, knowing it was 5-0 and I wasn't going to manage anymore." 
</P>
<P>
After his first no-hitter, Ryan told reporters: "I never honestly felt I was 
the type of pitcher to pitch a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
"Most said his stuff was unhittable," Valentine said, "so you thought that 
someday he would throw a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
On certain nights, of course, Ryan is still unhittable. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early '70s, his curveball was more devastating," Valentine said, 
acknowledging changes in Ryan. "It was harder and it had a bigger break. When 
he started it out at a right-hander's head, sometimes they would literally fall 
down and it would break over for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have that curve anymore, and yet he has better control of his 
fastball. His fastball used to be up and out of the strike zone a lot. Now, 
it's mostly in the strike zone, and off the plate to either side." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said that he has better command of his pitches, adding that, "as a 
pitcher, I'm much more knowledgeable.' 
</P>
<P>
He spent most of Tuesday making such statements in his laconic drawl, stepping 
from one interview to the next. He postponed an appointment with Yocum, he 
said, to handle the media's demands. 
</P>
<P>
He took calls from President Bush and former boss Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to explain how you feel," Ryan said at one point. "It's been so 
hectic since (the game) -- things really haven't settled down -- that it will 
be a few more days before it sinks in a little more. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that makes it so meaningful is that it came at such a late stage in 
my career and so much time had elapsed between the fifth and sixth 
(no-hitters). Because of that, and all the near misses, I think this one means 
more to me than maybe the others did." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan kept the ball that was used to record the last out. He sent his cap to 
Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Reese was asked if he'd ever been to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir," he said. "I plan on going in about five years." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
His father might still be playing.

A MILKY WAY OF LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
SINCE '47, DELIVERYMAN HAS BROUGHT MILK AND KINDNESS TO CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A small pile of wrenches and bolts rattles on the dashboard. A spare clutch 
plate and extra brake pad are stashed behind the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important piece of equipment in milkman Bill Ogburn's clunky, 
25-year-old truck is stored atop crates of low-fat milk when he makes his 
rounds at the edge of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's a box of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
"These are for the dogs," Ogburn said. "I give each of them one every time I 
see them. I don't have any bad dogs on my route. They know they're going to get 
a cookie." 
</P>
<P>
Ogburn, 64, has been delivering milk -- and cookies -- to Boyle Heights since 
1947. He hopes to retire after January when he turns 65. As he bumps along the 
neighborhood's hilly streets in his aging white truck, he realizes he is a 
dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
He sells about 600 gallons of milk a week. Customers who once ordered four or 
five gallons of milk at a time for their growing families now take only a 
half-gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"My son wanted to get into the business, but I told him, 'No way,' " Ogburn 
said. "It's a dead business. He decided against it -- he's an engineer with one 
of the aerospace companies instead." 
</P>
<P>
It was different in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 milkmen cruised the streets of Los Angeles and surrounding 
communities when he climbed into his first ice-cooled delivery truck, Ogburn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To young families just starting out after World War II, the milkman was just as 
important as the mailman. 
</P>
<P>
There were no supermarkets then. Many of the new neighborhoods that were 
springing up in the Los Angeles basin lacked the convenience of a local grocery 
store. And in the older neighborhoods, some families still used wooden ice 
boxes, where milk and butter could not be stored for long. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles dairy officials say there are fewer than 200 local milkmen still 
making their rounds today. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining milkmen are independent contractors who buy their own merchandise 
and provide their own trucks, gasoline and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Ogburn pays Adohr Farms $110 a month for office space and a place to park his 
truck where its electric refrigeration system can be recharged at night, said 
Cecelia Martin, retail delivery coordinator for the dairy. Home-delivered milk 
is generally priced about 40% more than store-bought milk, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects are slim for finding a replacement for Ogburn willing to work a 
12-hour day that starts at 3:30 a.m. Particularly when an increasingly 
dangerous, 30-mile route is involved. 
</P>
<P>
On two occasions, Ogburn said he has awakened homeowners and helped extinguish 
house fires he has spotted while driving on neighborhood streets. Once, he 
discovered the body of a customer who had been murdered in her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Ogburn has been robbed twice. Attackers broke his wrist last June and smashed 
his teeth and glasses three months ago. He no longer carries cash when making 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can take another beating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to many of Ogburn's 300 customers, he is like a trusted member of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
He regularly extends credit to those who need it. About 20 residents have given 
Ogburn their house keys so he can deliver their cheese, butter and milk 
straight to their refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
Many rely on him for groceries as well. He delivers ham, bread, flour and other 
items upon request. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like my adopted son," said Dora LaChance, a Cornwell Street resident who 
for 42 years has purchased milk from Ogburn for her family and herself. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll make special trips for me. I'm pushing 80 and I can't get out as well as 
I used to. I don't know what I'd do without him." 
</P>
<P>
LaChance soon may find out after Ogburn's scheduled retirement next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a vacation in so long that I've forgotten what it's like. I 
haven't taken off in 20 years," Ogburn said. Some of his customers, he said, 
still owe him money, but he knows some of them will never pay. "If they tell me 
the truth, I won't cut them off," he said. "I've got a lot of great folks." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, Ogburn drove his rusting Divco milk truck past derelicts 
lying on sidewalks and police making arrests near the crime-plagued Aliso 
Village housing project. He stopped for a lengthy front-porch chat with a 
customer on Boyle Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I've served that lady for over 30 years," he explained when he stepped back 
into his truck. "I've watched her children grow. She just was telling me that 
her daughter was mugged right in the front yard on Mother's Day." 
</P>
<P>
He released the huge lever that controls the truck's parking brake and pumped 
the gas pedal to bring its wheezing motor to life. Before pulling away from the 
curb, Ogburn checked his cookie supply. There were plenty left. 
</P>
<P>
"I love dogs," he said.
