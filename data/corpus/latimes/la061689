U.S. POLICY IN CENTRAL AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another fallout or residue of the Reagan legacy made print on the front page of 
The Times ("U.S. Seeks to End Contras' Base in Miami, Rebels Say," June 8) 
showing how our past President wasted taxpayer money in pursuit of his "dirty 
little war in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
The story reveals how a small group of Contra leaders now refuse to return to 
their homeland to participate in efforts to ensure democratic elections, 
preferring, in the words of a Bush Administration official, to live "the easy 
life in exile" in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Further in the story it was revealed that since 1982, the CIA has been funding 
these people to the tune of $500,000 a month. They've now been reduced to 
$200,000 monthly. The Contra military organization also receives $4.5 million a 
month in non-military aid to maintain an estimated 12,000 troops and their 
families in Honduras and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
How many homeless Americans would this money house? How many hungry Americans 
would this money feed? How many elderly Americans would this money comfort? 
</P>
<P>
When will our so-called leaders, both in the executive and legislative branches 
of government, open their eyes and bring an end to this madness? 
</P>
<P>
I submit, at this point in time, the enemy is not in the Soviet Union or its 
satellite nations; the real enemy is in Washington, D.C.

DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West must be careful to avoid spurious parallels between China and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
That it might do so is probably one reason that Mikhail Gorbachev has been 
watching events in Beijing with his heart in his mouth. He not only must worry 
that his own country may experience a similarly difficult popular uprising, but 
also that Western outrage over the Chinese government's brutal crackdown will 
spill over onto his own brand of communism, prolonging Western distrust of his 
reform program and endangering the chances of negotiating economic aid from 
Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of its reforms, China received many economic benefits from the 
West: observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
sales of technological equipment including military weapons and millions of 
dollars from more than 7,800 joint ventures established with U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev wants and needs similar economic boons. Items on the Soviet wish list 
include manufacturing and agricultural equipment, preferential treatment for 
Soviet exports and a trade agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is currently considering easing trade restrictions on 
Moscow, actions that could include repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment that 
ties most-favored-nation status to levels of Jewish emigration, and lifting the 
Stevenson Amendment that sets a limit of $300 million on Soviet borrowing in 
the United States. Meanwhile, thousands of businesses are considering 
joint-venture arrangements with Soviet firms. 
</P>
<P>
In that process, Washington should bear in mind that in deciding to reward 
China's economic liberalization, it held the Chinese to significantly lower 
standards than it set for the Soviets. The U.S. government did not require a 
particular level of emigration, for instance, or any promises whatsoever in the 
area of human rights. It did not demand that political reform accompany 
economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that Washington should excuse Soviet human rights abuses. On 
the contrary, the government should ensure that any policy changes clearly 
serve U.S. interests and promote universal values including free emigration. 
Likewise, all business deals with the Soviets should be prudent, based on solid 
commercial interests, not ethereal good will. 
</P>
<P>
China's betrayal of political freedoms does not portend a similar betrayal by 
Moscow. Domestic unrest may yet force Gorbachev to an unconscionable crackdown, 
but until then he should be judged on his own successes and failures, not 
China's.

'DEALING WITH MISS ETHEL'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read Al Martinez's column quite frequently and usually like what he writes. 
</P>
<P>
However, his "Dealing With Miss Ethel" upset me and I have a feeling I'm not 
the only one. 
</P>
<P>
I am (for the last 12 years) one of the those "Miss Ethels." I give my time as 
a volunteer working in a hospital gift shop and I think all of us who do this 
kind of work deserve praise. 
</P>
<P>
So most of us are about 70 and over and perhaps our eyesight isn't the best any 
more. We still give of our time and of ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
I think you did "Miss Ethel" and all the rest of us a great injustice.

Amen to your editorial opposition to covert electoral support to the Nicaraguan 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But how can you maintain that it is the Sandinista government which has made a 
mess of Nicaragua's economy? Surely most of the blame must fall on the U.S. 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
I hope President Bush will recognize that, and lift the embargo. After all, he 
made the welcome and humane statement that he would not countermand grain sales 
to the People's Republic of China as a sign of U.S. dismay at the Tian An Men 
Square massacre. We should be unwilling to inflict starvation and misery on any 
people, be they Chinese or Nicaraguan!

AID TO ISRAEL

How atrocious, how gruesome, how heartbreaking it was to watch Chinese people 
being murdered for the "crime" of wanting more independence, more democracy. 
Our President, expressing the outrage of the people of this country, has 
declared military sanctions against the government that has committed this 
atrocity. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, does the U.S. continue to send military aid to a government that 
ruthlessly and relentlessly murders a people who are also guilty of the "crime" 
of wanting their independence? That ruthless country is Israel and the victims 
are the Palestinians.

'DEALING WITH MISS ETHEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Al Martinez's column "Dealing With Miss Ethel" (May 30) about his 
trauma with "Miss Ethel" at Tarzana Hospital was amusing, I must take issue 
with his inference that hospital volunteers are all 70-ish, simply have time on 
their hands, and are "not too bright!" 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer workers at hospitals are of all ages and offer untold (non-medical) 
assistance for no pay. It isn't that they simply have time on their hands, it 
is simply that "they have time" to work in gift shops, manage blood banks, 
provide clerical assistance, work at reception or admitting desks -- in other 
words, assist in any of more than a dozen and a half areas. I have been a 
volunteer in the gift shop at St. John's Medical Center in Santa Monica for 18 
months. I can't believe the services provided by male and female volunteers at 
St. John's. They need our help and our smiles. 
</P>
<P>
I am also a new volunteer at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in its 
Heartline Program, a support group for heart surgery patients. We Heartline 
volunteers have all had heart surgery, also. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, after 41 years of being a businesswoman I have time to give, as do 
hundreds and hundreds of other volunteers who are willing to offer business 
expertise or do some menial task such as stuffing envelopes, because the 
hospital needs our help. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it be Tarzana Hospital, St. John's, Good Samaritan, St. Vincent's, 
etc., volunteer workers are worth their salt (in gold) for their services. It 
would be difficult for hospital administrators to estimate the value of our 
free and willing services. They need us. Perhaps "Miss Ethel" just had a bad 
day!

PROPOSITION 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November, 1984, Ronald Reagan achieved a landslide electoral victory, 
winning 49 of 50 states. He received 59.2% of the popular vote, to Walter 
Mondale's 40.8%. This margin of victory was considered to provide a "mandate" 
for a continuation and expansion of Reagan's policies. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, 62.3% of the voters of South Pasadena supported Proposition A, a 
measure to impose a modest parcel tax for the support of the local schools. 
However, this mandate was rejected because of an especially stringent clause of 
Proposition 13 requiring a two-thirds majority for passage of any new tax. But, 
the realities are, if Ronald Reagan couldn't get 60% of the vote in 1984, a 
requirement for 66.7% is unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Proposition 13 did not need a two-thirds majority for its 
passage. One could debate the merits of many aspects of Proposition 13, but 
certainly the two-thirds requirement is excessive, and must be replaced.

FANG LIZHI, THE 'CONTAMINANT'; 
</P>
<P>
DISSIDENT'S IDEAS LIVE IN THE PEOPLE -- AND INSIDE THE EMBASSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE GOLDMAN and MARSHALL I. GOLDMAN, Merle Goldman is a professor of 
Chinese history at Boston University; Marshall I. Goldman is a professor of 
economics at Wellesley College and the associate director of the Russian 
Research Center at Harvard. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In our first meeting with Chinese physicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li 
Shuxian, we came to understand why they have so enraged Chinese authorities. 
They refuse to accept not only the dictates of the Chinese Communist Party but 
its very legitimacy. Like the prophets of the Bible, as well as fellow 
physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife, Elena Bonner, Fang and Li hold to a 
different -- and to many, a higher set of values: human rights, decency and 
democracy. Neither the Fangs nor the Sakharovs have any patience with the 
excuse that arbitrary state controls are essential because the masses in China 
and the Soviet Union are not yet ready for self-rule or democracy. The Fangs 
and the Sakharovs are iconoclasts in societies where secular icons, arbitrarily 
decreed by the ruling Communist officials, are not to be challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Why was it, we asked the Fangs, that it was the hard scientists and a small 
number of literary intellectuals, such as Liu Binyan, who like the Fangs and 
the Sakharovs were among the first to challenge Communist Party orthodoxy? Why 
not the social scientists who, after all, presumably specialize in such 
matters? To Fang, the answer was simple. As a physicist, he had access to 
scientific literature from the outside world. He recognized that the official 
Chinese depiction of science differed from what fellow scientists in the 
outside world accepted. It was scientific criteria rather than political 
accommodation that affected his thinking and values. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way he came to question official Chinese descriptions of political, 
social and economic conditions both in and outside China. That meant that Fang 
and Li were among the first to question not only Mao but the entire Chinese 
Communist Party system. To Chinese officials, this meant that Fang was a 
troublemaker and a contaminant to be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Fang's ideas and his actions have had an impact on the 
democracy movement in China. In many ways, he served as the inspiration for the 
student demonstrations that occurred in December, 1986. But the irony is that 
in the recent demonstrations, Fang consciously kept a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities, however, must find someone or something to blame, and 
Fang is a convenient scapegoat. It is so much simpler for the leadership to say 
that Fang and a few student leaders caused the whole problem. Otherwise, the 
implication would be that poor political leadership and corruption among 
officials had provoked the student demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
By blaming someone prominent like Fang, they also can explain away the chaos 
and disorders that occurred and the fact that workers and ordinary people as 
well as students joined in the demonstrations. Since the creation of the 
Solidarity movement in Poland, there is nothing as frightening for Communist 
Party authorities as the nightmare that workers may take to the streets to 
protest not only economic upheaval but political deprivation as well. 
</P>
<P>
Against this background, it may be easier to understand why the Chinese 
leadership has called for the arrest of Fang and Li, even though of necessity 
this has created an inevitable fight with the United States. President Bush was 
embarrassed because he and his staff did not make more of a fuss when the 
Chinese police kept Fang from attending Bush's dinner in China a few months 
ago. Providing temporary refuge for Fang and his wife helps to compensate for 
that earlier show of timidity. 
</P>
<P>
Yet from the Chinese point of view, the safety provided by the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing is infuriating. It brings back memories of the 19th Century and 
extraterritoriality, when foreign governments set up special enclaves and 
declared themselves exempt from Chinese sovereignty. Under the circumstances, 
we cannot assume that the Chinese will respect international law and customs 
that are supposed to protect the operation of foreign diplomats and embassies. 
Whether we see a repeat of the sacking of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, we should 
remember that during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Chinese put embassies 
under siege for two months. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards torched 
the British Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Recent Chinese history has been scarred by periodic shifts between rationality 
and chaos. Admittedly, during the last few years, the Chinese seemed to be 
moving closer and closer to what appeared to the outside world to be normalcy. 
Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that rapid change and rapid economic 
growth can be disruptive, be it in China, Iran or the Soviet Union. The danger 
is that the conservatives overreact, as they seem to be doing now. 
</P>
<P>
It is tragic that recent events should be reduced to an assertion by the 
Chinese government that what happened never happened, and to an attack on the 
U.S. government for sheltering Fang. But in many ways this shows how difficult 
change can be for totalitarian regimes and how heroic, prophetic individuals 
symbolize both bravery and hope.

HARBOR GATEWAY RESIDENTS WANT RIGHT OF WAY TURNED INTO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS AGUILAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third time this decade, Harbor Gateway residents say they plan to fight 
possible development of an abandoned railroad right of way on Normandie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the estimated 85 people at a Harbor 
Gateway-Torrance Community Assn. meeting Tuesday night agreed to start a 
petition drive asking that the empty, 3.8-acre strip, which resembles a median, 
be made into a park area with grass, trees and bus-stop benches. 
</P>
<P>
The petition will be aimed at the area's City Council representative, Joan 
Milke Flores, and the owner of the land, Southern Pacific Transportation Co., 
which is negotiating to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the San Francisco-based company wouldn't disclose details of those 
discussions. "It would be premature," company spokesman Gerald Pera said. 
</P>
<P>
But residents at the meeting wanted immediate answers. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know, if we don't start something fast, this area is going to get more 
crowded than any of us wants," resident Tanya Burchad said. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents said they were concerned that a development on the land would 
add to traffic congestion. Others were worried that their property values would 
decrease if low-income housing were built. Twice before, residents have started 
petition drives to stop development of the strip. In 1981 and 1984, R.J.B.R. 
Development Co. of Harbor City was interested in buying the land and putting 
low-income housing on it. Each time, about 1,500 residents signed a petition 
opposing the project. In 1981, the developer withdrew the proposal. In 1984, 
the deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couldn't Estimate Cost 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by community activists Rochelle Bullock and Aloma L. Obringer to urge 
the city to buy the land and convert it into a park have failed. Neither city 
officials nor residents could estimate how much it would cost to turn the land 
into a park. 
</P>
<P>
Niki Tennant, field deputy for Flores, said, "In the past it was quite clear 
that residents didn't want development on the strip, but we never got a clear 
consensus that the majority of property owners wanted to pay the extra taxes in 
order to pay for the proposed green area." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said that in response to the 1984 development proposal, the city 
distributed to community activists a petition that residents could sign to set 
up an assessment district to pay for converting the land into a park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petition Failed 
</P>
<P>
The petition, which required signatures from 80% of the property owners in a 
half-mile radius of the strip, was never turned in. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock said that petition failed because no one wants to pay extra taxes for 
the proposed green area. "I think we could get the park built through a 
community block grant or recreational and park funds . And I'm going to make 
sure that's the way we get this green area," Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
She believes this may be the last chance to have the strip turned into a park. 
</P>
<P>
"How can this not be our last chance?" she said. "Look how many more people 
have moved here and how many housing units have been put up since 1980." By 
1986, the latest year for which the Los Angeles Planning Department has 
figures, Harbor Gateway population had increased by 15%, to 34,951. Only 
Westwood had a larger population growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's a Wasteland' 
</P>
<P>
Pera said the company would consider selling the land to the city. "The company 
doesn't mean to sound uncaring of the residents' needs, but the whole point is 
to sell the area because currently it's a wasteland," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents agree. Rusted track and overgrown weeds dot the narrow, gravel 
strip. Occasionally, teen-agers use it as an unofficial motorcycle raceway and 
scurry off before police arrive. A couch was dumped near Torrance Boulevard 
recently, and people leave old cars bearing For Sale signs near the Carson 
Street intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think grass and trees would look so much better there," Bullock said.

CABLE TV RENEWAL PROPOSED IN P.V.E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council this week introduced an ordinance that 
will, if adopted, renew for 10 years the Times Mirror Cable Television 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the new agreement, which has been negotiated for a year, 
Times Mirror Cable will provide access for 1,800 more homes within a year after 
the contract is granted. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance is adopted as expected after a public hearing on June 27, it 
will become effective July 27, and Times Mirror will have 30 days to supply its 
cabling maps to the city for final approval of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 13-year-old franchise with the cable company, 60% of the city, or about 
3,200 homes, has cable access. The new agreement will provide access to the 
remaining homes.

catch Frisbees for fun and prizes starting at 10 a.m. at Torrance Park, 2001 
Santa Fe Ave. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to bring their dogs out and throw a few Frisbees around for the 
dogs to catch," said John Jones, a city recreation supervisor. "People like to 
watch it because it's a great spectator sport." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, tortoise and turtle fanciers will take over the Torrance Recreation 
Center, 3341 W. Torrance Blvd., at 10 a.m. to show off the attractions of 
keeping the slow and quiet critters as pets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're clean and low-maintenance," said Betty Chambers, who has kept 
tortoises in her back yard for 15 years since the first one wandered in. "They 
don't have fleas, they don't bark, and you don't have to walk them." 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Parks and Recreation Department has staged the free dog 
Frisbee-catching contest for 10 years as part of the nationwide Ashley Whippet 
Invitational competition. 
</P>
<P>
It's named for a celebrity dog who could leap 9 feet in the air, run 35 miles 
an hour and catch Frisbees at sports and charity events. Ashley -- who even 
played the White House during the Carter Administration -- died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said 25 to 30 dogs usually turn out in Torrance, competing for T-shirts 
and Frisbees. Dog owners may register at 9:30 a.m. before the contest, which 
lasts until 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
One event is judged on the basis of how many plastic discs a dog can catch in 
90 seconds, while the other is judged on style. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where things get real fancy," Jones said. "A lot of times, the owners 
will do throws from behind their back and the dogs will turn in midair to make 
a catch. The best catch is when the dog is completely off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
He said up to 150 people turn out to cheer on their favorite dogs and snap 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Things will be a little more down to Earth the next day when the turtle and 
tortoise show focuses on these reptiles who love to burrow -- and aren't seen 
for weeks while they hibernate. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who come to our show are already interested, but some are 
walk-ins who discover a new hobby," said Cathy Berrett, president of the 
Westchester Chapter of the California Turtle and Tortoise Club. It is 
sponsoring the event that lasts until 4 p.m. Donations of $2 for adults and 
$1.50 for senior citizens are asked. 
</P>
<P>
Turtles from around the world will be shown, including one from Africa that is 
spotted like a leopard, a rare land tortoise whose shell pattern suggests a 
star, and a matamata from India. "It looks like a leaf, which is perfect 
camouflage for a damp, foggy area," Berrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Incubators containing turtle eggs will be on display, along with hatchlings. At 
the other end of the spectrum will be mature turtles over the age of 50. 
</P>
<P>
Although the terms turtle and tortoise are interchangeable, tortoise is more 
commonly used for the land animal, while turtle is associated with the reptile 
who swims in the ocean or freshwater. 
</P>
<P>
Experts will be on hand to provide information about housing and feeding 
turtles and tortoises and coping with their ailments, which can run from 
viruses to malaria. A turtle boutique will sell such things as turtle hats and 
hand puppets, mugs and magnets with turtle decorations and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
People who want to begin a collection will have it easy on Sunday. Turtle 
fanciers often have surplus animals and the club has an adoption service for 
those needing homes. "It's a very inexpensive hobby," Berrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Turtle collectors concede that some of their friends think it's strange to make 
a pet out of a turtle. After all, turtles can't even begin to catch Frisbees. 
But their owners say they enjoy their animals, which crane their necks out of a 
great sense of curiosity, sometimes follow them around in their yards and have 
a peacefulness that smoothes out the worst days. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a calming thing for me," said Diane Brouhard, who has 20 turtles. 
"When I'm stressed from the day, I hang out with the turtles and watch." 
</P>
<P>
Berrett said turtles have a way of living that their owners get to know. 
</P>
<P>
"They mate quite freely and you can watch them dig and burrow," she said. "They 
all learn to know you and know when it's time to eat." 
</P>
<P>
One of her desert tortoises is a crusty old fellow with a cracked shell. Old 
Timer, as he's called, is about 90, Berrett said. 
</P>
<P>
"I love his majesty," she said. "I look at him and know that he was on Earth 
before the automobile was (common). I think of how life has changed. It makes 
you feel humble."

WEEK IN, WEEK OUT, SOME SOLID ADVICE FROM NUWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an improbable source of mom-and-apple-pie-wisdom: a laundry company's 
sign board on a dowdy strip of Anaheim Street at the edge of the Cambodian 
business district. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there, week in and week out, year after year, Nuway Linen and Uniform 
Rental Service of Long Beach dispenses doses of homey sayings in four lines of 
80 characters or less. Drivers never know, cruising down Anaheim, what gem of 
Ann Landers-like advice will confront them, encouraging, teasing or 
sermonizing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you worry about missing the boat, remember the Titanic," Nuway counsels the 
keep-up-with-the-Joneses set. 
</P>
<P>
"To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing," the laundry 
instructs the sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
"Macho isn't mucho," it informs would-be tough guys. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep flaring and you will burn out soon," it warns the angry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began in 1950s 
</P>
<P>
The drive-by homilies have been appearing on the board since the 1950s, when 
Nuway erected the sign. But it was not until the 1970s that they became the 
board's regular fare, attracting a faithful following of readers who comment, 
offer their own slogans, and even kvetch if a boring advertisement too long 
replaces the tips for living. 
</P>
<P>
The musings are, in their down-home way, of course, a far more memorable 
advertisement for the commercial laundry than a "give us your dirty sheets" 
entreaty could ever be. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows where Nuway is, but if you say I work where the sign is, they 
know," said Rod Chandler, the company office manager who 11 years ago turned to 
one of his employees, Gini Conner, to take over the tradition of free advice. 
</P>
<P>
Conner, a Nuway worker for 13 years, feels the weight of her responsibility. 
After all, she has a reputation to uphold. 
</P>
<P>
People tell her they drive down Anaheim just to read her thought of the week. 
She has received fan letters ("They are not the ordinary, trite, cutesy quotes 
in the least," wrote one devotee), been invited to a bar by someone who wanted 
to buy her book of slogans (she didn't go and doesn't have the book), and had 
people walk in off the street to declare the rightness of her slogans. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to say they came out of my head, but it's not the truth," 
concedes Conner, who works in the accounts receivable department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alert for Ideas 
</P>
<P>
Ever alert for the appropriately sized quote, Conner snatches them from the 
Reader's Digest, greeting cards, books and anybody who gives her one she likes. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged widow and mother of two grown children, Conner has her standards. 
The phrases can't be too political, too religious or too far out. By and large 
they reflect a "plain ol', every day, apple-pie, baseball and American-flag 
philosophy." It just so happens to be hers, and she says, "I think a lot of 
people still have those ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Only twice, Conner recalled, has anyone complained about the slogan of the 
week. One was perceived as anti-feminist. It was something about women and 
grocery lines. 
</P>
<P>
Only once can she remember being stuck for something new to put on the board. 
That was a few weeks ago, for Mother's Day week. She headed for a nearby 
drugstore, browsed through the cards and found something. "I didn't buy the 
card," she confessed. 
</P>
<P>
She tinkers with the idea of putting together a book of all the sayings she has 
used. People already think she has one. In fact, a teacher called her once, 
asking for a copy for her students, and got irate when Conner told her there 
was no such book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone to the library and looked at quote books and I know I could do much 
better," she said, adding that they tend to be full of long-winded quotes from 
long-dead men such as Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
The laundry firm dates back to the 1920s, and although it was bought out by a 
national company in 1981, Nuway executives seem to like the old-fashioned 
flavor reflected by the sign board. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can they declare, as the board did: "Conference, a meeting of the 
bored."

DUNCAN PROVIDES LIFT IN 11TH; 
</P>
<P>
HE DRIVES IN STUBBS TO GIVE DODGERS WIN AND SWEEP OF ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The series finale with the Houston Astros Thursday night came down to Mariano 
Duncan driving in Franklin Stubbs in an unlikely scenario that lifted the 
Dodgers to a 2-1 victory in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently lifted the Dodgers in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as confident and high as we've been all year," starter Tim Belcher 
said. "It's early enough that we feel we can make a move and win again. 
</P>
<P>
"We've proved it the last three days by sweeping a team that had swept us." 
</P>
<P>
The three in a row at Dodger Stadium served as redemption for the four in a row 
that the Dodgers lost in Houston recently and also moved the Dodgers to within 
4 1/2 games of the first-place San Francisco Giants in the National League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Houston had arrived with a winning streak of 10 on the road and six overall, 
but it is the Dodgers who have now won five straight, ignited by the move that 
put Kirk Gibson in the leadoff role and sustained -- as they have been 
throughout the season -- by a pitching staff that has allowed two earned runs 
or less in 33 of 64 games and leads the major leagues with an ERA of 2.64. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 42,782 saw Belcher shake off a sinus infection to strike out 10 and 
allow only four hits over the first eight innings Thursday night, yielding the 
Astros' only run in the fourth on a single by Louie Meadows, a stolen base, and 
a single by Bill Doran. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell pitched two shutout innings before John Wetteland, who earned his 
first major league save Monday night, gained his first major league victory by 
pitching a scoreless 11th. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros, who had made a specialty of winning close games, going 9-4 in extra 
innings and 20-11 in games decided by one run, had only six hits. The three 
Dodger pitchers struck out 12 and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got only seven hits but benefited from seven walks and the speed of 
their new leadoff hitter. Gibson, on base 14 times in his five games in that 
role, reached Thursday night on two walks, a fielder's choice and an infield 
single that helped tie the game, 1-1, in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Schatzeder walked Alfredo Griffin to open that inning after 39-year-old Bob 
Forsch had shut out the Dodgers on four hits through seven. 
</P>
<P>
A sacrifice by Dave Anderson, batting for Belcher, moved Griffin to second. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson then hit a slow chopper that the charging Doran fielded. Doran looked at 
first base and saw he had no play on Gibson then wheeled toward third and fired 
across the diamond attempting to catch Griffin in a wide turn. 
</P>
<P>
The throw was wide and low, however, and bounced into the Dodger dugout as 
Griffin trotted home with the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed did it again," Manager Tom Lasorda said, alluding to Gibson's hustle in 
taking the play away from Doran and forcing the error. "I mean, I've never seen 
anyone get down the line like he does." 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Juan Agosto was the Houston pitcher in the 11th, which Stubbs 
opened with a looping single to left. Stubbs had replaced Eddie Murray at first 
base in the top of the inning when Lasorda did a double switch involving his 
pitcher's place in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
The infrequently used Stubbs had been hitless in his only four at-bats against 
left-handers this year. He had also stolen only one base before taking 
advantage of Agosto's breaking ball repertoire to steal second and then move to 
third on Mike Scioscia's groundout to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton was walked intentionally, and Duncan then batted for John Shelby. 
It was Duncan's first at-bat since May 26 and first game action since May 27, 
when he cut and sprained his right hand fielding a ground ball against the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
He came off the 15-day disabled list Monday, which weighed on Houston Manager 
Art Howe as he decided whether to walk Duncan with a base empty. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to force the pitcher to work with the bases loaded and I figured 
that since he hadn't played in a while he might be rusty," Howe said. "I guess 
he wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan jumped on the first pitch and rammed it to the warning track in center 
field, a double or triple normally but a single in the game-ending situation. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda had come down from the third base coaching box to tell Duncan to be 
alert for a squeeze sign ("We were going to get that run in some way," the 
manager said later), but when he didn't get it, Duncan said he looked "for a 
pitch I could drive" and did get that. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming out early, taking extra batting practice," he said. "The hand 
is 100% and I've been hitting good even though I haven't played in about 20 
days." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the real hero was Scioscia for advancing the runner, though coach 
Joe Ferguson had an early premonition as to whom the hero would be. 
</P>
<P>
"He came over to me in about the seventh or eighth inning and said he had a 
feeling that I would do it tonight," Duncan said, having made a prophet of the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray struck out twice and was hitless in five at-bats, stranding seven 
runners Thursday night. He has only four hits in his last 47 at-bats and has 
not hit a home run in 30 games, a span of 110 at-bats. Murray is hitting .226. 
He was at .307 on May 3. . . . John Shelby's struggle continued as well. He 
grounded into two double plays and struck out for the 51st time as his average 
fell to .161. . . . Houston shortstop Rafael Ramirez left the game in the third 
inning with a sprained left wrist suffered on a tag play at second base.

CLARK BACK ON THE JOB; PADRES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He stood at home plate Thursday afternoon in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, 
watching the flurry of 12th-inning activity around him and waiting for 
who-knew-what. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark's in-season vacation had been interrupted, after he had viewed the 
past 20 innings of baseball from the Padre dugout, attempting to purge from his 
mind the memory of 10 strikeouts in his past 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
So he stood at home in the late afternoon shadows and waited for something, 
anything, good to happen. 
</P>
<P>
He took a few swings, a few more stretches, put one foot in the batter's box 
and scanned the field. 
</P>
<P>
What he saw was Mark Parent at second and Garry Templeton at first. Cincinnati 
pitching coach Scott Breeden walked out to the mound and called for 
right-handed reliever Kent Tekulve to replace Tim Birtsas. 
</P>
<P>
When the preliminaries finally ended, Clark stepped up for his first pinch-hit 
appearance this season. And he tapped a full-count single to left field, 
allowing Parent to rumble home from second to give the Padres a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second victory in two days for the Padres, and modest though it may 
be, it takes away some of the sting of a seven-game losing streak that ended 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
While helping to salve Clark's psyche, the victory also allowed Bruce Hurst to 
keep his sanity. Hurst pitched brilliant baseball for 10 innings, allowing 
eight hits and striking out 10. But he left with a 0-0 score and memories of 
two other times the Padres failed to come up with a run when he pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris (2-2) limited Cincinnati to one hit in two innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no doubt that this day belonged to Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Despite carrying a .217 batting average, a zero-for-20 slump and a major 
league-leading 77 strikeouts with him as he came up in the 12th, Clark received 
a partial standing ovation from what was left of a crowd of 20,942. That became 
a standing roar from fans and Padre players after he won the game. Teammates 
spilled onto the field as Clark returned to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on this ballclub is delighted for Jack," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "I think it's a tremendous lift for him. I tell you, you couldn't have 
seen 30 guys more happy for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Clark was facing a two-strike count before he had a chance to take the bat off 
his shoulder. "I thought the first one was low," Clark said. "The second strike 
was in a good spot, outside, but I didn't really want to try to hit it because 
you can pull the outside pitch into a double play." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Clark watched three consecutive balls sail by, fully aware that there 
were two runners on and just one out -- not to mention two strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I have a lot of strikeouts this season, I'd rather strike out in 
that situation and give one more guy a chance to get a hit there than hit into 
a double play," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the oh-and-two count was probably the best thing that could have 
happened to me because it helped me concentrate a little more." 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the rest hadn't hurt, either. McKeon took Clark out of the 
lineup Wednesday hoping to take some pressure off. He said that Clark also 
would not start today against Houston right-hander Jim Clancy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to sit back and observe," Clark said. "That was one of the first 
times this year that I felt like I was going to get a hit rather than feeling 
like I had to get a hit." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he didn't hit the pitch, a slider down and away, that hard: "It just 
hit the right spot." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tekulve: "It was a good pitch, right where I wanted it. He just hit it. It 
was the same pitch he's been striking out on for the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two strikes were fastballs. After that, I wanted to set him up for 
the slider, because that's been getting him out. I did just what I wanted to 
do. It just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Hurst; a scoreboard reading of "Padres 0" is all too familiar to 
him. He didn't get the decision Thursday, remaining 5-5, but didn't get the 
loss, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about that stuff," Hurst said. "How many runs I get . . . I 
don't care. Sometimes you have to win, 1-0." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst reached double figures in strikeouts for the second time this year and 
15th time in his career. He struck out six in the first three innings before 
settling back and letting his fielders do some work. 
</P>
<P>
The results were completely different than his last outing, a 12-2 loss to San 
Francisco in which he allowed six runs and 10 hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Dobber (pitching coach Pat Dobson) and I talked between starts about keeping 
the ball down, and I made a conscious effort today to keep it down and throw 
strikes," Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst threw 79 strikes and 40 balls Thursday. He needed every strike, because 
Cincinnati starter Tom Browning was just as tough. Browning went seven innings 
and held the Padres to three hits. Browning, who shut out the Dodgers, 5-0, in 
his last start, ran his consecutive scoreless innings streak to 17. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine innings, no Padre runner advanced beyond second. The Reds, 
meanwhile, were able to get Rolando Roomes to third in the fifth against Hurst, 
but he was left there. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's replacement at first, Rob Nelson, gave the Padres their best chance to 
score a run when he hit a ball into deep right field in the fourth inning. But 
Roomes drifted back to the fence and leaped high above the 327-foot marker to 
steal a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton was the only Padre to have more than one hit. He doubled in the fifth 
-- his third in three games -- and singled Parent to second in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
That set up the game's two most dramatic events: Clark's hit and Parent's 
sprint home. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati left fielder Van Snider looked as if he might catch the 225-pound 
Parent at the plate, but the throw was about 10 feet up the third-base line and 
off toward the Red dugout. Parent slid anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out there (to second base during the pitching change) twice to make 
sure Parent took a good lead," said Sandy Alomar Jr., the Padres' third base 
coach. "My plan was to send him all the way if he got a good lead. Snider 
played for me in Puerto Rico, so I know he has a very good arm, but the only 
way I was going to hold Parent up was if Clark hit a bullet right at Snider. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I saw the ball hit, and where Snider was playing -- pretty deep -- there 
was no doubt in my mind I'd send Parent. I was running with him to the plate, 
and I almost beat him there." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Mark Parent raised some eyebrows in the 12th by having a few words with 
plate umpire Fred Brocklander before slicing a single to right-center field. 
Benito Santiago had already pinch-hit and was out of the game. "Things got 
scary in the 12th with Bernie (Parent's nickname) arguing with the umpire," 
Tony Gwynn said. "We would have had to win it there (if Parent had been 
ejected) because we have no catchers left." The likely choices to catch in that 
scenario would have been Luis Salazar or Carmelo Martinez, who were both in the 
game at the time. . . . Cincinnati outfielder Eric Davis left the game in the 
ninth inning after aggravating an injury to his right hamstring. He likely will 
sit out today's game in San Francisco and return Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
HE LET JACK DO IT 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was happier about the winning hit than newest Padre Shawn Abner, who was 
on deck. Page 11A.

"There's more exciting Pacific Coast League action tomorrow when the Dukes and 
Stars play at 7 p.m. The Dukes thank you for your support and ask you to please 
drive home safely -- and you kids get off that dugout right now!" 
</P>
<P>
As "Cub Scout Night" gets predictably out of hand in the Albuquerque Sports 
Stadium -- scores of uniformed children asking, nay, demanding autographs and 
sweatbands -- another mark is etched in Dennis Burtt's voluminous minor league 
ledger. 
</P>
<P>
He was the Albuquerque Dukes' starting pitcher that Tuesday night against the 
Las Vegas Stars. The Dukes, the Dodgers' triple-A affiliate, won the game, but 
Burtt was lifted with one out in the second inning and his team trailing, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes came back for a 16-13 victory, which meant Burtt neither won nor lost 
in his 336th minor league pitching appearance. If you're wondering, 336 is not 
a record, just nearly half a man's life and practically all of his aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Burtt has spent 14 summers pitching in such places as Elmira, Winter Haven, 
Pawtucket and Toledo. He's in his third summer at Albuquerque, living with his 
wife, Terri, and his 2-year-old daughter, Nichole, in a pink stucco apartment 
that borders a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
His baseball life spans teammates named Kevin Costner -- yes, that Kevin 
Costner -- Bruce Hurst and Wade Boggs. There was a brief trip to the major 
leagues, a 31.50 earned-run average that sent him back to the minors and then 
last Tuesday night against the Stars when he walked off the mound in the second 
inning and into the dugout, placing his glove, cap and self down gently on the 
bench, because that's his way. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries not to let things get to him," Terri said. "He's even tempered and 
easygoing. He might be stirred up inside, but basically he keeps a lot of 
things inside." 
</P>
<P>
He was once told by someone in the Boston Red Sox organization that he didn't 
get mad enough to be a big league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Brent Strom, the Dukes' pitching coach: "If Dennis didn't have the 
temperament he has, I'm sure he would have developed a drinking problem by 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Burtt is 31 and has an 0-3 record this season with a 7.42 ERA. They love him in 
Albuquerque, though. They think he's a great influence on the younger kids, the 
prospects. When it comes to his prospects, however, his age undermines another 
shot at the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the chances of Dennis pitching with the Dodgers are slim," said 
Charlie Blaney, Dodgers' director of minor league operations. "That's not to 
say Dennis doesn't have a place in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
And the minors have been his place for 14 years. Perhaps it is his saving grace 
-- and tragic flaw -- that Dennis Burtt was given enough talent to chase his 
dream every summer, but only enough to chase. 
</P>
<P>
The gods sentenced Sisyphus to an eternity of pushing a boulder up a mountain, 
only to have the rock roll down every time he was ready to push it over the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
In more recent mythology, a hero named Crash Davis (a.k.a. Kevin Costner) spent 
a lifetime in the minor leagues, including one season with the Class-A Durham 
Bulls. What sustained him in the movie "Bull Durham" was a brief taste of the 
major leagues, a genuine love of the game and the fear of what life would be 
like without it. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is here and Dennis Burtt has started yet another push. Seemingly a deep 
well of optimism, even he gets discouraged and angry. When he does, he throws a 
ball against a wall. The ball hits the wall, then bounces back. 
</P>
<P>
So does he. 
</P>
<P>
Where Burtt's love of the game comes from, he doesn't know. He played a lot of 
sports as a kid. Baseball was always his favorite, but it wasn't a passion. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that his father, Howard, was enamored of the game and passed that on 
to his son. Howard didn't play the game. The closest he had been, before he 
started coaching Dennis in Little League, was selling seat cushions during 
Hollywood Stars' games. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had fun playing," Dennis said. "Maybe it's because I always won." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he holds the distinction of having won championships in all five minor 
leagues in which he has played. Is that one a record? Good luck checking it 
out. Burtt seems both proud -- he displays the championship rings in a glass 
case hung on a wall -- and embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"How many guys have been around the minors that long?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
He played at Villa Park High School. He was a sophomore whiz kid. In one 
inning, he played shortstop, catcher and pitcher. Also on that team was a 
chubby-faced kid with a bad haircut named Kevin Costner who didn't make much of 
an impression. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he played with Costner in high school, Burtt said no, then 
paused. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that who that guy was," he said. "I knew a guy named Costner. Was that who 
he was? Gee, I always thought his name was Keith." 
</P>
<P>
Burtt graduated in 1975 and spent a year at Rancho Santiago College -- then 
called Santa Ana College -- before signing with the Red Sox. He was sent to a 
rookie team in Elmira, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
So were 18 other pitchers. Elmira didn't have a staff, it had a mob. 
</P>
<P>
"And they kept every guy for the whole season," Burtt said. "But some of those 
guys only got a couple innings of work all year." 
</P>
<P>
Burtt got 44 and was 5-0 with a 1.23 ERA. The Elmira team was 50-20 that summer 
and easily won the New York-Penn League championship. Burtt got his first ring. 
So did Bruce Hurst and a singles hitter named Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Duly impressed, the Red Sox assigned Burtt to their Class-A team in Winter 
Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"What I remember about Winter Haven is that high school football was huge there 
and that we didn't draw very well," he said. "I think we averaged 50 people a 
night, unless a grocery store was giving away free food and then they'd pack 
the place. But come Friday (when the high schools played football) you could 
forget about it. Nobody showed up." 
</P>
<P>
He spent three seasons in Winter Haven, helping the team win the Florida State 
League title in 1979 by going 11-10 with three saves and a 2.37 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he moved up to the double-A team at Bristol, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Bristol was beautiful, very green, but it was very hot and humid during the 
summer," Burtt said. "One day, when the team was out of town, a storm came 
through and knocked down part of the right-field wall, tore off the stadium's 
aluminum roof and knocked down some light poles. So when we got back, they told 
us we'd have to play two weeks of games at noon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so hot. You'd cover yourself in wet towels and you still couldn't stay 
cool. We took up a pool to guess how many people would show up to those games. 
Two and three were very popular guesses. Actually, about 20 showed up. I don't 
know why." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be asked about Burtt. Why? He doesn't have a stock answer for 
what seems, by now, a stock question. He only says, "This is what I do." 
</P>
<P>
He also says there are only two things that will make him quit: injury or the 
lack of a team willing to sign him. Burtt, a finesse pitcher who is most 
effective when he's throwing in the mid-80s, believes he can pitch for another 
five or six years. 
</P>
<P>
And there is every indication that there will still be clubs willing to pay 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis is the ideal triple-A player," said Pat McKernan, general manager of 
the Dukes. "He does his job, he's a great example to the young kids and he does 
whatever is asked of him. I think for guys like Dennis, there should be a 
special designation, like 4-A." 
</P>
<P>
Clubs especially love Burtt because he causes no problems. If they ask him to 
be their long relief man, he agrees. Short relief, sure. Starting rotation, 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one reason I've been around, because I don't cause any hassles," Burtt 
said. "I basically did whatever I was told. But now I think, maybe if I would 
have complained, or got a little mad, maybe it would have helped me move up. 
It's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Burtt was 10-8 with a 2.81 ERA and Bristol won the Eastern League 
championship. For the two years he played in Bristol, he was writing letters 
and making long-distance phone calls to Terri, whom he met during the 
off-season in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of each season in Bristol, Terri would meet Burtt, then drive 
back home with him after the season. The routine remains much the same after 
nearly seven years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
After every season, they get into their van -- complete with customized bed -- 
and drive back to California. They have put 120,000 miles on the van, pulling a 
small trailer that contains most of their possessions and stopping at virtually 
every national park and monument that presents itself interstate close. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean everyone doesn't pack everything they own and drive hours and hours 
and unpack, then do it all over again a couple months later?" Burtt asked. 
</P>
<P>
They never truly unpack. There is no home to unpack in. What with the sudden 
moves and the uncertainty and the fact that it doesn't always pay a lot of 
money to be a baseball player, they haven't bought a home. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Burtt will make the most he's ever made, $35,000. But there was 
one summer at $14,500, and several at $17,000 and $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
They spend half the off-season with his father, who lives in Moreno Valley, and 
the other half in Stockton with Terri's parents. 
</P>
<P>
When they can, they try to earn a few extra dollars. Terri works as a dental 
assistant. Dennis has worked at art supply and hardware stores. "Dennis is real 
content, no matter where he is," Terri said. "To me, I think it might be nice 
to be able to have some place to call our own." 
</P>
<P>
But she says the thought of asking him to quit does not cross her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told him that baseball has got to be his decision," Terri said. "He has 
to be finished with it, otherwise he'll never be happy. My dream is to have our 
own house. I know we'll get that down the line. To do something like tell him 
to give up his dream, something that can come back and haunt us, just isn't 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Terri has been with Dennis every season since 1982, the year, Dennis was 
promoted to the Red Sox triple-A club at Pawtucket, R.I. While he was gone on 
the first trip of the season, Terri decided to go to the local shopping mall. 
She got lost, panicked, finally found her way home "and didn't go out of the 
apartment for the rest of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has made solo trips in the van from Florida to Toledo and from 
Florida to Minnesota -- when Dennis was called up by the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
"For wives, there are a lot of lonely times in baseball," Terri said. "But I 
like the life style. And I think, best of all, this kind of life has showed me 
that I can do things on my own. I can drive into a strange town like Toledo by 
myself and find us a place to stay for that summer." 
</P>
<P>
But next winter, Terri would like to stay in Stockton. She's expecting the 
couple's second child in early September. They have been offered the use of her 
parents' house. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis wants to play winter league ball in the Dominican Republic. Terri 
has been along on all the winter ball trips -- her first was to Venezuela -- 
but now she wants to have a home, if only for a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be our own place," Terri said. "Right now, for this one winter, that 
really appeals to me." 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable question was asked: What if you have a boy and eventually he 
wants to play pro baseball? What would you tell him? 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have a talk with him and let him know what he's getting into. But I think 
baseball is a good experience for most guys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if Nichole wanted to marry a minor league player? 
</P>
<P>
Terri laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I would have a very different conversation with her." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the Red Sox organization after the 1984 season, Burtt was picked 
up by Minnesota and played with their triple-A affiliate in Toledo, where he 
was 14-8 and was called up to the big league club near the end of the 1985 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He was 2-2 in that time and made the team the next spring. "I can't describe to 
you how that felt," Burtt said. "It was just outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of his major league career hasn't been. He gave up seven runs in 
the two innings he pitched in the '86 season. He was sent down and has never 
made it back. 
</P>
<P>
But in that short time, he can tell you everything, and in great detail, as if 
he has a movie playing over and over in his head. 
</P>
<P>
He can tell you about Twin pitcher Mike Smithson handing him the baseball from 
Burtt's first victory. He can tell you about the coach who pulled him aside 
after a bad outing and told him, "Ray (Miller, then the Twins' manager) has no 
confidence in you." 
</P>
<P>
He can tell you not only that a guy singled off him, but that the ball bounced 
off the shortstop's glove. Or that another player hit a lousy blooper that 
landed just out of the reach of the third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one of these guys who remembers every pitch he ever threw," Burtt 
said, "But I think you remember the best and worst times. That was the major 
leagues for me. Being there was the best time I've ever had. Having to leave 
was the worst. One thing I think about once in a while is how a lot of players 
get called up and sent down, then called up and sent down again. They get a lot 
of opportunities. But all I got was that one shot. But I guess I got one more 
than a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
And if he never gets another shot? "I can be happy with the career I've had," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has won 116 games, lost 87. He thinks that after his career is over, he'd 
like to be, surprise, a pitching coach, ideally with a Class-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Crash Davis loitering around with a Class-A club when we last left him? 
And what about Crash Davis? When Burtt saw "Bull Durham," did he wince? 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit, he reminded me of someone I know very well."

JIM MURRAY: FIRST DAY IS OFTEN FOR OUTSIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROCHESTER, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to Wuthering Heights West. 
</P>
<P>
How do you par a swamp? What club do you use for ooze? 
</P>
<P>
If you're ever in Rochester, bring a raft. It's hard to tell where the Genesee 
River leaves off and the town begins. It'd be a nice town, but it leaks. Two 
more days of this and the Open may find itself on Mt. Ararat. 
</P>
<P>
You would think a golf course like this would be harder to play in the rain 
than a tuba. Not so. It plays longer. You don't get any roll. But it plays 
softer. You don't want any roll on a green. 
</P>
<P>
The leader board looks as if it's bleeding to death. Red numbers, signifying 
under-par scores, make it look like an explosion in a ketchup factory. You can 
play target golf when the greens are as soft as a bowl of Cream of Wheat. The 
ball sticks like a dart where you hit it. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, you can't fly a ball at the flagstick in a U.S. Open. The greens 
are harder than a landlord's heart. The fairways move a ball faster than an 
ocelot. You defend yourself against a U.S. Open course, usually. 
</P>
<P>
When it's wet, you fly at its throat. 
</P>
<P>
The old-timers in this 89th U.S. Open field can't believe their good luck. They 
try not to lick their chops as they look out there and see a bog instead of a 
dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
You look at the leader board and it looks like the Supreme Court. Not precisely 
the nine old men but certainly the three wise men and company. There's Jack W. 
Nicklaus. And Raymond Floyd. There's Tom Kite. You keep looking around for Gene 
Littler. 
</P>
<P>
These guys know what to do with an Open course that's lying on its side with an 
arrow in it. They're like Dempsey with his man on the ropes and cut. 
</P>
<P>
See Jack Nicklaus as he comes in with a 67. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have rain, it modifies the peril of an Open course," Nicklaus 
concedes. "The golf course gets easier, even if it gets longer. The fire of a 
U.S. Open golf course is the fastness of its greens and fairways. Rain dampens 
this fire." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Open is supposed to belong to the guys who have been here before. It is 
like a college reunion. It's supposed to belong to the legends. 
</P>
<P>
The lords of the game fly in on their own jets or the Concorde from Europe. 
They have people who meet them with limos, they stay in private homes, have 
breakfast in bed and dinner in sumptuous private dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
They usually make the history books, but they don't always make the first-day 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you have to remember that a young Ben Hogan once teed it up in one of 
these things with the dew cutters' patrol, mail-order slacks on his skinny 
butt, fingers trembling slightly as he wrapped them around the club, maybe a 
ball with a little cut in it and clubs with electrician's tape on the handles. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest scores for single rounds are not always shot by name pros. The golf 
world was shocked in 1950 when someone named Lee Mackey Jr. stepped up with the 
dawn patrol and shot an opening 64, the lowest score ever posted to that time 
in a U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
The glass slipper didn't fit. Lee Mackey Jr. shot an 81 the next day and wound 
up making $100 for the week and drifting out of the public eye except as a 
trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
But it took 16 years for another player to match that score. A club pro out of 
Texas, Rives McBee, shot his 64 in the second round. But when he surrounded 
that with rounds of 78-76-74, he managed to take only $1,700 back to Midland. 
</P>
<P>
There are 156 players in this Open field. There are only about 50 who 
realistically can win. Still, there are a lot of guys who come here with dreams 
of glory dancing in their heads but not much money in their lockers. No one 
sends a jet -- or even a limo or taxi -- for them. No one knows their names. 
They put up at a motel that has a telephone, king-sized bed, telephone and 
shower over the tub. They probably eat in the room. 
</P>
<P>
The world expects them to be gone by Friday night, when the field is scissored 
to accommodate the real high-rollers and send the ribbon clerks on their way 
back to the mini-tour or a job cleaning clubs in Ottumwa. 
</P>
<P>
No one gets in this thing on a pass or a note from home. You shoot your way 
into an Open. The aristocracy make it on past performance -- they won this 
event in the past 10 years or a Masters or British Open in the past five. Or, 
they've won a million or so dollars on the tour in the past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Emlyn Aubrey is none of the above. He got in this thing basically because he 
won -- a little traveling music, professor -- the Philippines Open! 
</P>
<P>
That was a tournament Seve Ballesteros and Jack Nicklaus never did have to tee 
it up in, but Aubrey tried three times to get his tour card on this continent. 
When he couldn't, he had to round up three sponsors from his hometown of 
Reading, Pa., and see if they would bankroll him on the Asian tour. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many guys would take their clubs to Kuala Lumpur and courses where they 
had to chase the monkeys -- and the cobras -- off so they could tee it up. But 
Aubrey didn't have much choice. 
</P>
<P>
There was more than $36 million to be played for on the American tour last 
year, but the Asian tour held out considerably less. About $35 1/2 million 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's like cleaning elephants. You have to do it if you want to stay in 
show business. So, Aubrey took the act to the jungles. 
</P>
<P>
ABC didn't have any cameras there. In the Philippines Open, he didn't have to 
hold off Greg Norman or Fuzzy Zoeller. In fact, he had to make up seven shots 
in the final round against a Swedish golfer, who obligingly shot a final- round 
77. Sweden, of course, does not have a winter tour. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer has his own jet, but the players on the Asian tour travel in 
converted World War II cargo planes. The one Aubrey found himself in, flying 
from Pakistan to Calcutta, had the requisite number of engines and wheels. The 
only trouble was the fuselage. It had this little 6-inch hole in the floor. He 
could see the ground real clear. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if you know anything about flying, you know that, at altitude, a hole in 
an airplane tends to get bigger and a condition known as explosive 
decompression takes place, which can suck you and whoever's near you right out 
of the plane and into the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Aubrey's plane never got much higher off the ground than the 
hedges. He got safely to Calcutta -- if that's a place any golfer would really 
want to be -- but after that experience, a 15-foot, two-break putt would be a 
box of chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
Winning the Philippines Open didn't put Aubrey in the U.S. Open, although it 
did the British. Here, he had to undergo sectional qualifying at the site of 
the Kemper Open. Winning at Manila merely excused him from the first 
qualifying, or local, stage. 
</P>
<P>
He shot a 69 Thursday and briefly led the U.S. Open, since his was the third 
group to tee off. Leading the Open when you have a 7:27 tee-off time is no 
great trick and some of the registered giants of the game had already gone by 
him by the time the sun set on Oak Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Winning the U.S. Open and the Philippines Open in the same year is not exactly 
the Grand Slam. But Aubrey's the only one who's still alive in that difficult 
double. Look at it this way: Did Hogan ever do it?

Ted Sator, who coached Buffalo to a pair of third-place finishes but was unable 
to get the Sabres past the first round of the National Hockey League playoffs, 
was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that this development became necessary," Sabre General 
Manager Gerry Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
Sator, who succeeded Craig Ramsay as coach in December, 1986, had a 96-89-22 
record with the Sabres, which became the eighth NHL team to change coaches 
since the end of the regular season.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE CAN MAKE SOME BIG MONEY, BUT HE'D PROBABLY PAY FOR IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tyson, after describing how he would dispose of scheduled opponent Carl 
(the Truth) Williams and proposed opponents Evander Holyfield and George 
Foreman, said: "I will whip Tony Mandarich's tail, also. Oh, yes, I would love 
to make him suffer. He is a big man. I would love to make him cry." 
</P>
<P>
Would Mandarich be wise to take such a match, even for $10 million?. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Dave Kindred of the Atlanta Journal writes. "For that much money he can 
get a private room, 24-hour nursing, a heart pump and a very nice neck brace. 
Accepting certain limitations, he has a chance to live a meaningful life." 
</P>
<P>
Add Mandarich: According to USA Today, a radio station in Antigo, Wis., had a 
weekend fund-raiser to help the Green Bay Packers sign Mandarich, their No. 1 
draft choice. Mandarich is asking for $1.8 million. The fund-raiser netted 
$13.98. 
</P>
<P>
Add Tyson: Says Matt Baranski, who has worked the corner in most of Tyson's 
fights but was in Holyfield's corner when the two squared off in a sparring 
session at the 1984 Olympic trials: "Evander did very well with Mike. It could 
have gone either way. But now, Mike will knock him out. I've seen Holyfield, 
and he's too easy to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Add Baranski: He no longer works for Tyson, having been cut adrift when Tyson 
fired trainer Kevin Rooney, but he told the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union: "I was 
told that Mike still says I'm his main man. We were always good friends. I 
never interfered with his private life. Mike is a very intelligent kid, but 
some of the things he has done have given me second thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What title was at stake in the Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns 
fight? 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Bud Grant, on how he learned about discipline playing 
for Paul Brown at Great Lakes Naval Station during World War II: "One day a 
player who had been drinking showed up for practice. Coach Brown ordered him 
back to his barracks, and when the guy got there, they already had his orders 
ready, shipping him to the South Pacific. From that day on, the rest of us were 
afraid to sneeze." 
</P>
<P>
It ain't bluegrass: When Rick Pitino signed a reported seven-year, $5.7-million 
contract with the University of Kentucky, it ended speculation that he was 
using Kentucky to squeeze more money out of the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Paul Daugherty of the Cincinnati Post: "Pitino couldn't make that kind of 
money anywhere else and still be called Coach. And anyone who drives a Mercedes 
on an annual income of $35,000, as Pitino did a decade ago at Boston 
University, appreciates the color of money." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The World Boxing Council super-middleweight title, which was 
held by Leonard and retained by him, by virtue of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: San Diego Padre Manager Jack McKeon, asked the name of a recently 
born granddaughter: "They haven't decided. She's the baby to be named later."

STATE DFG OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING FOR GILL NET OFFENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the State Department of Fish and Game are looking for Nhieu Van 
Nguyen of Montebello, who was caught and cited for illegal use of a gill net 
early this month off the Malibu coast. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen was arrested June 3 by DFG warden Jorge Gross, who was on routine patrol 
when he encountered the fisherman in a near-shore area off Point Dume. 
</P>
<P>
Gross cited Nguyen for using a gill net with a mesh of less than six inches in 
water less than 48 feet deep, and for commercially fishing for surf perch 
during a closed season, June 1-Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said that upon review of a log kept by Nguyen, he has since added a 
charge of false documentation of records. Each charge is a misdemeanor with a 
maximum penalty of $1,000 and a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, however, may be in more serious trouble. His net was secured to his 
boat with steel cables by Gross and he had three days after the arrest to post 
bond to have the net freed for use, but has failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have to use bolt cutters to free the net and if he has done that, he 
will have tampered with evidence, and that's a whole new ball of wax," Gross 
said. "If he has done that, he could have his gill net privileges revoked." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gross, Nguyen had 107 pounds of black surf perch, 66 pounds of 
assorted other fish, which included the state protected Garibaldi, and 274 
pounds of opaleye aboard his boat. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said he also has video tape of about 500 dead kelp bass floating near 
Nguyen's boat. Kelp bass are off limits to commercial fishermen and Gross said 
it appeared that Nguyen caught the fish in his net and dumped them over the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"These fish are spawning and many are juvenile fish, and the law's designed so 
that these fish are not impacted in the shallow areas," Gross said. "When 
something like this does happen, there can be a substantial loss in the 
near-shore fishery." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, 47, is scheduled to appear at Malibu Municipal Court on July 19. PETE

Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Butch Reynolds led a star-studded group of withdrawals 
Thursday from The Athletics Congress Outdoor Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster, Andre Phillips and Danny Harris also were among the late 
withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meet, several world-class athletes, led by six-time Olympic gold 
medalist Carl Lewis, said they would not appear. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of this meet qualify for the U.S. team for the World Cup meet at 
Barcelona, Spain, Sept. 8-10. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, the 1988 Olympic champion in the women's long jump and 
heptathlon, pulled out of the 400-meter intermediate hurdles because of 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, two-time world champion and 1984 Olympic silver medalist in the 
110-meter high hurdles, withdrew because of foot problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, world record-holder and the Olympic silver medalist in the 400 
meters, withdrew from the 200 because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, Olympic champion in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles, was entered 
in the hurdles and the 400 meters, but reportedly is suffering from a virus. 
</P>
<P>
No explanation was given for the absence of Harris, 1984 Olympic silver 
medalist in the intermediate hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Other big-name athletes who said before the meet that they would not compete 
were Edwin Moses, Mary Slaney, Al Joyner, Willie Banks, Valerie Brisco, Judi 
Brown-King, Billy Olson, Kevin Young, Danny Everett, Joe Falcon, Jim Spivey and 
Sydney Maree. 
</P>
<P>
Among those advancing to the semifinals in the high hurdles were: two-time 
Olympic gold medalist Roger Kingdom, who won his heat in 13.28 seconds; Arthur 
Blake, who was second in 13.30, and Tonie Campbell, who finished fourth (13.53) 
in his first race since ending a 90-day suspension for refusing to take a drug 
test.

DAVIS PERFORMS IN GRAND STYLE FOR SEATTLE, 9-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin Davis' grand slam in the seventh inning and Greg Briley's two-run homer 
in the eighth inning led the Seattle Mariners to a 9-5 victory over the Twins 
at Minnesota Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Infield singles by Omar Vizquel, Harold Reynolds and Briley loaded the bases 
before Davis connected for the sixth grand slam of his career and his seventh 
homer of the season to put Seattle ahead, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Briley then hit his second home run of the season with Vizquel aboard. Vizquel 
reached base on a one-out single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre is happy to have Davis back in the lineup, after 
Davis recently spent time on the disabled list with a strained left calf 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed him when he was on the disabled list," Lefebvre said. "He means so 
much to this team because he is our top threat. He's a guy we rely on. Hitting 
that grand slam is another one of those things that makes him great. 
</P>
<P>
"We have guys who can hit well ahead and behind him in our order. Now he is in 
a perfect batting position." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Dennis Powell (2-2), retired the Twins in order in the sixth to get 
the victory. Mike Jackson pitched the final three innings to gain his third 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 6, Toronto 4 -- Gary Sheffield's seventh-inning sacrifice fly drove 
in the winning run and Rob Deer hit two home runs at Milwaukee as Brewer 
reliever Tony Fossas earned his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gantner and Paul Molitor opened Milwaukee's winning rally with consecutive 
singles. Gus Polidor forced Molitor at second before Sheffield drove in Gantner 
with a flyball to left. 
</P>
<P>
Said Deer, who has 15 home runs this season: "The first time up (a line drive 
to shortstop), I hit a slider. I hit it hard so I thought I wouldn't see 
another slider. I went up looking for fastballs after that and that's what I 
got. It was just one of those days when I got good pitches to hit and I hit 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto starter Jimmy Key (6-6) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Yount's club record for most consecutive games played ended at 276 when 
the Brewer center fielder missed the game with a bruised left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Cleveland 4 -- Bill Buckner reached 1,200 career RBIs by driving 
in three runs, two of them during a three-run eighth inning that gave the 
Royals a come-from-behind victory at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals trailed, 4-0, after two innings and were behind, 4-2, entering the 
eighth. But George Brett started the inning with a walk, finishing Cleveland 
starter John Farrell, and Bo Jackson singled off reliever Doug Jones (2-3), who 
blew a save for only the third time in 17 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
After Jim Eisenreich struck out, Buckner doubled just inside the left-field 
line, scoring both runners. Pinch-runner Bill Pecota went to third on Matt 
Winters' single, and pinch-hitter Pat Tabler grounded to second, scoring Pecota 
with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Saberhagen (6-4) gave up four runs, three of them earned, and seven hits 
in seven innings. Jeff Montgomery and Steve Farr each pitched an inning, with 
Farr getting his 15th save in 17 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 3, New York 2 -- Rene Gonzales singled home the winning run with two 
out in the 10th inning to give the Orioles a victory at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' hit snapped an 0-for-9 slump and drove in Mickey Tettleton, who led 
off with a double off Lance McCullers (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Mark Thurmond (2-1), pitched the 10th inning and earned the victory for 
Baltimore after starter Jeff Ballard allowed two runs and 10 hits in 7 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
After Tettleton's double, Joe Orsulak was intentionally walked, Randy Milligan 
popped out and Larry Sheets flied out before Gonzales got his game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, the Orioles completed the first AL triple play of the 
season and their first in 10 years. After singles by Rickey Henderson, Steve 
Sax and Don Mattingly gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead, Steve Balboni lined to 
shortstop Cal Ripken, who threw to second baseman Bill Ripken to double Sax, 
and the relay to Milligan at first got the third out.

<P>
Less than 24 hours after she received her diploma from El Dorado High School in 
Placentia, Janet Evans conducted business as usual Thursday, the first day of 
the Mission Viejo Chrysler Motors International Swim Meet of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the first of eight events in which she is scheduled to compete 
during the four-day meet, Evans won easily in the 800-meter freestyle with a 
time of 8 minutes 39.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Ensimon, who lives in Santa Barbara, finished second in 8:55.58, 
followed by Sarah Anderson of Riverside, who had a time of 9:00.93. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who last year set the world record of 8:17.12, took an early lead and 
pulled away from the field to win by 25 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a workout swim for me," said Evans, who will attend Stanford in 
the fall. "I just tried to keep getting ahead of my competition and see how far 
along I am in my training. I was happy with the way I swam." 
</P>
<P>
Evans will compete in the 400-meter individual medley and 200 butterfly today; 
the 400 freestyle and 200 backstroke Saturday, and the 200 individual medley, 
200 freestyle and 200 breaststroke Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her graduation the night before, Evans said: "Picking up my high 
school diploma was a little different. It was a sad experience for me, but I 
was also happy. I'm going to miss high school, but I'm real excited about 
starting college." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the men's 800 freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat overcame a strong 
challenge from fellow Pole Mariusz Podkoscielny to take the event with a time 
of 8:08.62. Both swim for the Mission Viejo Nadadores team. 
</P>
<P>
Podkoscielny, who finished second in 8:10.79, stayed with Wojdat until Wojdat 
edged ahead with 200 meters left. U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen finished third in 
8:14.86.

ARREOLA STRIDES CONFIDENTLY IN MIDDLE DISTANCES AND HER PERSONAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a gift from her grandparents when Darcy Arreola was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
And the "Born to Run" necklace that the Cal State Northridge junior wears 
describes her now -- she is one of the nation's finest young middle-distance 
runners -- as accurately as it did in 1986 when she won the state high school 
title in the 1,600 meters and was ranked second in that event in Track and 
Field News' national high school rankings. 
</P>
<P>
While running is still Arreola's top priority, her reasons for competing have 
changed since high school. 
</P>
<P>
Running served as an escape for Arreola then. Enjoyment and satisfaction keep 
her going now. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked going out there and running every day by myself, because at my house 
there were four kids," said Arreola, who will run in the semifinals of the 
1,500 meters in The Athletics Congress track and field championships tonight at 
the University of Houston. "I shared a room with two sisters and I never had 
any time to myself. I think I liked running so much because it allowed me some 
time to be with myself." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Arreola, 20, spends much of her time with her boyfriend, Dan Lange, 
who won the hammer throw for Northridge in the 1987 and '88 California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, running was all I had," said Arreola, who placed third in the 1,500 in 
the NCAA Division I championships two weeks ago. "But now, I have a serious 
boyfriend and that's helped me to relax. There's more to my life than just 
running. . . . I still want to win as badly as before, but I have something 
else, which makes it more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Her athletic success also has helped transform Arreola from a painfully shy 
girl into a fairly gregarious woman. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola wouldn't talk to her teachers in elementary and junior high school, and 
she was "terrified" when reporters interviewed her in high school. Now she 
smiles and laughs when interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to tell me in high school that I was the worst interview," said 
Arreola, who has earned eight NCAA Division II All-American certificates in 
track and cross-country. "I was so afraid of talking to reporters back then. It 
was scary. Now, it's a lot easier because I'm used to talking to people. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what got me over my fear. I was forced to talk to people. I couldn't 
just walk away." 
</P>
<P>
Lange, 24, has noticed a big change in Darcy's personality since he was 
introduced to her in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just a very shy, little girl when I met her," Lange said. "It took me 
about a year to get to know her before I asked her out. . . . She just has a 
lot more confidence now in herself and her ability to express her feelings. 
She's better at communicating with people and it's helped her confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola attributes some of her childhood shyness to a family tragedy. Her 
mother was killed when she was 3 years old, after which she, her two sisters 
and brother were raised by her grandfather, Fernando Arreola, and his second 
wife, Diane. 
</P>
<P>
"She was known as the little girl who didn't speak to anyone," Diane Arreola 
said. "She was the little shy one of the family. Her brother and sisters were 
much more outgoing than she was." 
</P>
<P>
Said Darcy: "Although I don't remember anything, it had to have affected me. 
Perhaps me worse than my brother and sisters. If I saw a 3-year-old kid 
suddenly put in a new home -- a completely different environment -- I would 
expect it to have an effect on that kid." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola's older brother Paul introduced her to running when she was in 
elementary school. After she graduated from junior high in 1982, he agreed to 
buy her running shoes and clothing if she continued in high school. He also 
promised to continue a tradition of buying her doughnuts after she won races. 
</P>
<P>
"I did pretty well when I was a little kid," Arreola said. "Although I never 
trained. I just ran the races and whenever I won, I got my doughnuts, and 
thought, 'cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
After being ineligible her freshman year at La Mesa Grossmont High because she 
lived in the district of another high school, Arreola became serious about 
running in her sophomore season after winning the 800 meters in 2 minutes, 13 
seconds at the Grossmont League finals, and, a few weeks later, the San Diego 
Section 800 title in 2:16. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big surprise," she said. "But it made me think, 'Hey, I could be good 
if I started training more.' " 
</P>
<P>
After training diligently in the summer of 1984, Arreola reaped the benefits in 
her junior season, winning section titles in cross-country and in the 1,600. 
She placed second in the 800 and third in the 1,600 at the state championships 
and ran bests of 2:09.06 in the 800, 4:38.6 in the 1,500 and 4:56.43 in the 
1,600. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, she successfully defended her section cross-country and 1,600 
titles, ran 4:23.9 in the 1,500 and 4:42.77 to win the 1,600 in the state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
She intended to run for San Diego State that fall but was informed on a 
recruiting trip to Arizona that she had failed to meet Proposition 48 
requirements in core curriculum classes, having completed only 1 1/2 years of 
science classes when two were required. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard of Proposition 48 until then," Arreola said. "My counselors 
didn't know what it was and neither did my coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Having been mistakenly told that she couldn't make up the required units in 
summer school, Arreola considered going to Grossmont College before Division II 
schools Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Northridge entered the picture. She 
initially favored San Luis Obispo over CSUN, but when Northridge Coach Don 
Strametz expressed more interest in her than Mustang Coach Lance Harter, she 
became a Matador. 
</P>
<P>
Harter's loss was Strametz's gain. It enable him to work with a Division 
I-caliber athlete at a Division II school. But he has been wary of abusing the 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, she is undertrained," Strametz said. "Judging by what I have seen 
and what I have read, her best years are way down the line. She's not going to 
run her best times until she's in her late twenties. . . . My goal is to have 
her graduate from here with a healthy body so that she's capable of doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola had a superb freshman season, placing 11th in the Division II 
cross-country championships in Riverside, running 2:05.73 in the 800 and 
4:15.35 in the 1,500, and finishing second in both events at the Division II 
meet in Cape Girardeau, Mo. She concluded her season with a 10th-place finish 
in the 1,500 at the TAC meet in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Her progress has been painstakingly slow since then, however. 
</P>
<P>
Although she won Division II titles in both the 1,500 and 3,000 -- in which she 
has a personal best of 9:13.2 -- in San Angelo, Tex., as a sophomore, Arreola 
failed for the first time to lower her 1,500 best (running 4:15.39) during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frustrating," she said. "Because I had always improved a lot each 
season until then. . . . I was in shape to run a lot faster than I did last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
According to Strametz, Arreola had a legitimate shot at nabbing the third and 
final place on the 1988 U. S. Olympic team, but she ran poorly in the trials in 
Indianapolis -- finishing 11th in a semifinal (4:18.48) -- and failed to 
qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
"She was in 4:05 or 4:06 shape," Strametz said. "But she just didn't run well. 
It was the end of a long year. It had been 10 1/2 months with no breaks since 
she started the cross-country season. And she was scared. She felt that she 
didn't belong at that level." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola concurred with her coach, saying that she was confident of running well 
at the trials until she stepped to the starting line in her qualifying heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just like, 'No way, these girls are just way better than me,' " said 
Arreola, who won the 3,000 and placed second in the 1,500 (personal best of 
4:14.15) in last month's Division II meet in Hampton, Va. "I didn't feel like I 
belonged there. . . . Looking back, it was stupid. I had as much right to be 
there as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Strametz hopes that the experience of last year's trials and this year's 
Division I and II meets has taught Arreola a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very conscious of splits and at times that's caused some problems," 
Strametz said. "She always wants to run fast. She needs to worry less about 
certain times and more about just competing. She competed at the Division II 
meet and she ran a (personal record), even though she probably didn't expect 
to. She competed at the Division I meet and although she died in the last 300, 
she competed." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes, the last 300 meters of a race, the bane of Arreola's racing career at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Never the strong point of her race, her kick was particularly weak in the 
Division I meet, which was held in the rarefied air at Brigham Young 
University, 4,549 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
Running stride for stride with Wisconsin junior Suzy Favor at the 1,200-meter 
mark, Arreola watched helplessly as Favor (4:15.83) surged away in the final 
300 meters, and as Rosalind Taylor (4:21.97) of Maryland swooped past her in 
the final 10 meters of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really into that race mentally, but I just slowed down so much in the 
last lap," said Arreola (4:22.40), who ran a 58.4 final 300 after averaging 68 
seconds per 400 for the first three laps. "With a lap to go, I was thinking, 
'relax, relax.' I was feeling so good -- and it felt so easy -- that I was 
thinking, 'I can win this.' But when she took off, I just tensed up and started 
to slow down. When (Taylor) passed me, I just thought, 'OK, come on, where are 
the rest?' " 
</P>
<P>
Strametz attributed Arreola's demise to the altitude. He said that many of the 
runners -- such as Favor -- had been in Provo for two weeks prior to the meet, 
which allowed them to become better acclimated to the elevation than Arreola, 
who flew into town a day before she ran in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"With a 300 to go, it looked like someone had erected a brick wall in lane 1 
1/2 and she hit it and Favor went through on the inside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Altitude notwithstanding, Arreola learned from that race that she must improve 
her upper body strength to become one of the nation's top runners. "Stram told 
me that in the past," Arreola said, "and I know he's right now. I mean, you 
look at the other girls and I look a lot weaker than them." 
</P>
<P>
Strametz said that the 5-foot-6, 108-pound Arreola needs to increase her 
workout weight in the bench press from 90 pounds to 120. 
</P>
<P>
Serious weightlifting will have to come later in the year, however, as Arreola 
could be racing in late August if things go well this weekend. If she places 
among the top two collegians at TAC, she will qualify for the World University 
Games in Duisburg, West Germany, Aug. 22-30. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want her to compete this week," Strametz said. "If she competes, I 
think we're both going to come back with big smiles." 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically, Arreola is looking for a fast time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm in shape to run under 4:10, but I could live with a 4:11," she 
said, laughing. "Four-fourteen is just not doing it."

<P>
KINGS BEGIN PAYBACK FOR GRETZKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings will begin paying the draft-pick portion of the price tag on Wayne 
Gretzky this weekend, when Edmonton steps forward to claim what would have been 
the Kings' first-round pick in the entry draft Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The powers that be in the National Hockey League are gathering in Minneapolis 
for meetings, for the supplemental (college) draft this morning and for the 
vastly more important entry draft Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In return for Gretzky last August, the Kings gave up Jimmy Carson and Martin 
Gelinas, $15 million and three first-round picks, one each in 1989, 1991 and 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out, though, that Edmonton's own first-round pick is better than the 
one it has from the Kings. Edmonton will use its own pick for the 15th 
selection in the first round and the Kings' pick to claim the 18th selection. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' first pick will be No. 39, late in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The experts are saying that this will be a weak draft. But who knows? As 
Pittsburgh General Manager Tony Esposito has put it, speculating on the 
potential of 18-year-olds is a crapshoot. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' philosophy has been to take the proven talent and win now, letting 
others do their gambling through the draft. "I've heard that some people think 
this is a bad year for the draft," King owner Bruce McNall said. "But I don't 
know that that means all the way through. I think they're talking about the 
first few picks. They haven't seemed to agree on a big star. It really 
shouldn't affect us, where we're drafting." 
</P>
<P>
After claiming No. 39, the Kings will sit back and wait for No. 81 in the 
fourth round. The Kings' pick in the third round went to the New York Rangers 
in the deal that sent Marcel Dionne and Jeff Crossman to New York in March of 
1987 for Bob Carpenter and Tom Laidlaw. The Rangers later traded the pick to 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Even more uncertain than the talent in the entry draft is the talent in today's 
supplemental draft, a draft of college players, 21 or older, who have never 
played professional hockey. 
</P>
<P>
With so many general managers, owners and coaches gathered in one spot, trades 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
McNall, who has been trying to persuade the rest of the league to go along with 
him in his desire to add West Coast teams, realign the divisions, or both, to 
make the Kings' travel schedule more reasonable, will use the opportunity to 
continue his lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
"Those issues are not on the agenda this time, but of course I'll do some more 
lobbying," McNall said. "Not that it's done me much good. I can't seem to get 
my points out of the lobby and upstairs into a meeting."

The St. Louis Blues on Thursday traded their all-time leading scorer, Bernie 
Federko, and left wing Tony McKegney to the Detroit Red Wings for center Adam 
Oates and right wing Paul MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Federko, 33, who has played his 13-year career with the Blues, scored 1,073 
points in 923 games. He said he was sorry to leave St. Louis but looked forward 
to going to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Demers is a very good coach," Federko said. "I had three of my very 
best years with the Blues when he was coaching, so I'm excited that I'm going 
to be back playing for him." 
</P>
<P>
McKegney, 31, after scoring 40 for the Blues in 1987-88, had only 25 goals and 
17 assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
Red Wing General Manager Jimmy Devellano said he needed to find replacements 
for Bob Probert and Petr Klima, who are not expected to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
Oates, 26, is coming off his best season. He had 16 goals and 62 assists for 78 
points in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, 31, scored 36 goals and 35 assists for Detroit, but finished the 
season in Demers' doghouse.

COULD CAUSE RECRUITING PROBLEMS;

<P>
'WESTHEAD LEAVING' RUMORS FLY AS FAST AS LOYOLA'S ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sports rumor mills have worked overtime since Paul Westhead arrived as 
basketball coach at Loyola Marymount, especially in the last two years when 
Westhead's teams have set scoring records and appeared in the NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead has been mentioned for virtually every coaching opening from Stanford 
to Washington to Texas to Providence. Reports have had him interviewing across 
the country, from sea to shining sea, from the high and mighty (Kentucky) to 
the lowly and downtrodden (Clippers). 
</P>
<P>
The rumors and Westhead sightings have stopped just short of the supermarket 
tabloids linking him to extraterrestrial teams and recruiting Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing is, Westhead has not actively sought another job since coming to 
Loyola four years ago and has rarely been contacted by the dozens of teams 
supposedly craving him. 
</P>
<P>
The latest stops on the reported Westhead itinerary were the University of 
Maryland and the New York Knicks. The Baltimore Sun reported that Westhead was 
a prospective candidate for the Maryland opening; apparently that was 
speculation. Maryland did talk to several coaches -- including USC's George 
Raveling -- before hiring Gary Williams from Ohio State. But Westhead said he 
"was never involved" in the Maryland hiring process. 
</P>
<P>
So the day Williams was hired at College Park, another report hit the news 
wires saying Westhead was talking to Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi. And, 
indeed, Westhead said he had spoken with Bianchi this week. But, Westhead said, 
linking a conversation with Bianchi to a job offer was jumping to a conclusion. 
It was merely a conversation between old friends, Westhead said, about 
everything but the job opening. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Newsday's report that the two talked business? "I did speak 
(with Newsday) and made it very clear we did not talk about the job," Westhead 
said. "There's nothing to it." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said the constant job rumors are more amusing than irritating. "It's 
not like every week you're indicted for something," he joked. "I don't put a 
lot of stock in (rumors) but I don't find it annoying. If your name is being 
mentioned, I guess the spill-off is it's a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
He has found that it can cause anxious moments when recruiting. "It is curious 
when I talk to a prospective recruit," he said. "They or their parents will 
invariably say, 'We hear you're leaving.' My feeling is it's kind of 
interesting. I'm here starting my fifth year and the rumors always come from 
places where the coach has been there a lot less than five years. But if the 
recruit is concerned, there could be damage." 
</P>
<P>
One signing was held up recently when Westhead's name surfaced for the Kentucky 
job. Tony Walker, a guard out of Ventura College, finally signed a few days 
later. The Kentucky job wasn't filled until last week, when Rick Pitino was 
hired away from the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
While the Westhead rumor mill continues to churn, he said his summer travel 
schedule is built around recruiting for Loyola, scouting the high school 
all-star camps and tournaments at Princeton, N.J., Santa Barbara and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead, who last coached in the National Basketball Assn. in 1983, has always 
maintained that he would listen to an attractive offer (Knicks?) but is happy 
at Loyola, where his fifth team -- with a nucleus of Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble 
and Jeff Fryer -- appears capable of a West Coast Athletic Conference title and 
a three-peat in the WCAC Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead's only other coaching plans for the summer involve a fast-break clinic 
in Great Falls, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me they have the greatest hunting in the country there," he said. "I 
said, 'I don't hunt.' They said they have some of the best fishing in America. 
I said, 'I don't fish.' They said they have a couple of the best golf courses 
around. I don't golf. But they said, 'C'mon up anyway, we'll have a great 
clinic.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, sounds fishy. Is there a coaching opening at the College of Great Falls? 
</P>
<P>
Back spasms cost Loyola star Hank Gathers a possible spot on the U.S. team that 
is competing in Mexico City to qualify for the World Games. The 6-foot-7 
Gathers was reportedly 
</P>
<P>
felt he was not sufficiently healed to accompany the team to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers is back in Los Angeles, Gathers is back in Los Angeles, has resumed 
normal workouts and training and said he felt that he made a good impression on 
pro scouts who attended the workouts. Westhead, who attended part of the 
tryouts, said Gathers "was certainly everyone's equal" and "was clearly in the 
plans" of U.S. Coach Bobby Cremins. "The spasms took a couple of days to cool 
down. It's nothing really serious. He's back lifting weights." 
</P>
<P>
Although the West Coast Athletic Conference hasn't been considered one of the 
nation's premier basketball leagues, WCAC teams did well in the 1980s. As the 
WCAC prepares to enter a new decade, it will be building on a 10-year winning 
percentage of .550. The WCAC's eight teams played better than 200 games above 
.500 at 1,185-971. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams played above .600: Pepperdine (187-110, .630), Santa Clara 
(178-113, .612) and San Francisco (123-80, .606). Three more were above .500: 
Gonzaga (157-106, .597), St. Mary's (147-130, .531) and Loyola (138-137, .502), 
and San Diego was right behind at 134-138 (.493). Only Portland was truly in 
arrears, at 121-157 (.435). Over the last four seasons Loyola has won nearly 
two-thirds of its games at 79-42. 
</P>
<P>
During the decade, half the teams had top seasons of 25 wins or more -- Loyola, 
Pepperdine, San Diego and USF. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine makes a pretty good case for being the WCAC's program of the decade. 
Not only did the Waves have the best record in men's basketball, they also were 
tops in baseball at 397-203 (.662) and won every WCAC baseball title for the 
last six years. The Waves were also strong in volleyball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount lost its top baseball recruit to the pros. Third baseman Andy 
Fox out of Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento was a second-round 
choice in the pro draft and signed with the Yankees this week for a large bonus 
. . . Loyola outfielder Travis Tarchione, who was not drafted last week, has 
signed a pro contract with Salt Lake City. Teammate Miah Bradbury, a junior who 
was expected to be taken in the first couple of rounds, is reportedly 
disappointed at being a sixth-round pick and is leaning toward returning to 
Loyola. The catcher was selected by the Phillies . . . Cal State Dominguez 
Hills golfers Jeff Manare and Rick Chartrand have received All-Region honors . 
. . Dominguez Hills soccer players Chris Wilson and Kristi White have been 
named to the West Regional Olympic Development teams, making them part of the 
talent pool that will provide the 1992 Olympic teams.

6 ERRORS COST CITY ALL-STARS IN 8-2 DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the City Section All-Star baseball team, the humor in Thursday night's game 
against the Orange County All-Stars could not have been accurately measured by 
a laugh-o-meter. 
</P>
<P>
The number of errors committed gave a much more precise gauge. 
</P>
<P>
The City team made six miscues in an 8-2 loss to Orange County at USC's Dedeaux 
Field. All the Orange County runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that say six or eight?," City 4-A Player of the Year Gino Tagliaferri of 
Kennedy High said as he looked at the right-field score board. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, normally a shortstop, played third base and started the comedy of 
errors in the second inning when a throw from Chatsworth catcher Eric Johnson 
bounced off his glove and into left field, allowing Laguna Hills' Rob Milo to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
The City added three errors in the third, giving Orange County five unearned 
runs and a 6-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Take those errors away and we're better," Tagliaferri said. "We're just out 
here for fun anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The City pushed across its first run in the fifth when Taft's Jason Shapiro, 
who singled and stole second base, scored on Damian Valdivia's bloop single to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County added two more runs on two City errors in the sixth to take an 
8-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester's Victor Darenzbourg, pinch-running for Adam Zutler of Taft in the 
seventh, scored on a two-out single by University's Eric Alexander to account 
for the final City run. 
</P>
<P>
Six Orange County pitchers combined for a five-hitter and struck out 10 in the 
nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hits by Shapiro, Valdivia and Alexander, Mark Flores of 
Fremont and Jesse Espinoza of Banning each singled for the City. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth's Derek Wallace pitched the fourth and fifth innings for the City, 
allowing no runs.

WOMEN'S PRO VOLLEYBALL RETURNS THIS WEEKEND

<TEXT>
<P>
The women's professional beach volleyball tour will return to Southern 
California this weekend for the $15,000 Huntington Beach Open. 
</P>
<P>
About 32 two-woman teams will play in the tournament all day Saturday and 
Sunday on the sand courts south of Huntington Beach Pier. The winning team will 
divide $3,700. 
</P>
<P>
The tour's top team, Jackie Silva and Patty Dodd, will vie for a fourth 
tournament victory in five events this season. Silva and Dodd are well ahead on 
the tour with $6,000 in winnings apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The money is nowhere near the six-figure incomes of the top players in the 
men's game, but things are looking up, according to Craig Elledge, promoter of 
the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't even have a tour until a few years ago," said Elledge, who started 
in volleyball promotion when he worked for Group Dynamics Inc., the firm that 
promoted the men's professional tour until two years ago. "I worked on the 
first big women's event for Group Dynamics in 1987. When it started, it wasn't 
even worth it for the girls to come out. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, we had $5,000 events. Then, last year, it was $10,000 and this year 
it went from $10,000 to $15,000. So it's been going up in blocks of five." 
</P>
<P>
And Elledge says you can see the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls are taking the sport more seriously. A lot of them came out this 
year in a whole lot better shape. They were thinner and they had grown some big 
muscles, so they've been spending some time in the weight room." 
</P>
<P>
There has also been changing of partnerships. The most significant involved two 
of the most dominating players on the beach, Silva and her partner from last 
year, Linda Chisholm. This year, Silva -- the former Olympian from Brazil who 
is considered by some the best player on the women's tour -- opted for Dodd, a 
Colombia native who is married to Mike Dodd, one of the stars of the men's 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
This left the 6-foot-2 Chisholm, an Olympic silver medalist in 1984, to team up 
with Janice Opalinski. And, according to Elledge, the result could be 
devastating to the rest of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to see them improve a lot," he said of the pair that won 
a tournament in Cleveland two weekends ago -- the only event that didn't go to 
Silva-Dodd. "Opalinski is a fiery back-court player who played for three years 
with Kathy Gregory (the long-time beach star who retired after last season). 
She's not a big blocker and hitter, but she keeps the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
"Paired with Chisholm, who's a big hitter and big blocker, they could be a lot 
like (Sinjin) Smith and (Randy) Stoklos on the men's side. Chisholm can 
dominate the net while Opalinski roams the back court." 
</P>
<P>
Another new duo that has found success this season is Nina Matthies and Elaine 
Roque, veterans who join Silva-Dodd and Chisholm-Opalinski as the top three 
teams on the tour, Elledge said. Also challenging for top spots are Lori Kotas 
and Gail Castro, Dale Hall and Karolyn Kirby and the imposing pair of Lisa 
Strand (6-foot) and Judy Bellomo (5-foot-10). 
</P>
<P>
The next stop on the women's tour is the John Shaw Open at Manhattan Beach Pier 
on June 24-25.

ROLLER HOCKEY DEVOTEES EXPANDING INTO LEAGUES, NATIONAL COMPETITION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marco Thompson is the president of a multimillion-dollar computer design firm. 
Paul Chapey owns a marketing consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
But every Sunday night they can be found at the Sweetwater Roller Rink, rubbing 
elbows and swinging sticks with the opposite end of the economic spectrum -- 
7-Eleven clerks, beach bums and unemployed students. 
</P>
<P>
The common ground? 
</P>
<P>
A passion for the sport of roller hockey -- hockey played on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
"I live for roller hockey," said Thompson, who says he often works up to 80 
hours a week. "I can work and be successful at my job, but I have more fun 
playing roller hockey with these guys than anything I do." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, Chapey and a small group of others began playing together in San 
Diego about eight years ago. That group has grown to 60, enough that Chapey 
decided to organize things. 
</P>
<P>
At 45, Chapey is the oldest player in the six-team San Diego Roller Hockey 
League, which formed this year. He is also the league's commissioner and the 
coach of the San Diego Hosers, an all-star team that will represent San Diego 
in the national championships July 9-13 in Mt. Clemons, Mich., a suburb of 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Chapey said he is putting in a bid for San Diego to be the host city for next 
year's national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a big boost to the sport locally if we could get it," said Chapey, 
who grew up playing roller hockey in the streets of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Flames forward Joe Mullen recently gave the sport a boost nationally 
through an article in Sports Illustrated. Mullen and his brother, Brian, who 
plays for the New York Rangers, grew up playing roller hockey in the Hell's 
Kitchen section of Brooklyn, N.Y., where the style of play closely resembles 
the National Hockey League's. 
</P>
<P>
The article mentioned that riot police once arrived by helicopter at the 
Brooklyn roller rink where the Mullens played. 
</P>
<P>
Chapey said the New York brand of play reminds him of the movie "Rollerball" -- 
a science fiction thriller that took a masochistic look at the sport of roller 
derby. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego -- and at the national tournament -- a more wide-open, 
finesse-type game is played. Checking is prohibited, and five players (four 
skaters and a goalie) are used instead of six. There are also no blue lines or 
red lines, meaning there are no offsides calls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the no-checking rule is safety. Since the Sweetwater 
Rink has cinderblock boards, a hard check into them could mean the end of a 
season or a career. 
</P>
<P>
It also requires defenseman to play the puck instead of the person. 
</P>
<P>
But there still is a fair amount of incidental contact. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like basketball,' Francis Weidinger, a member of the Hosers who has 
been playing roller hockey since grade school. "They say basketball's a 
non-contact sport. We're not like New York, but we have our share of pucks in 
the face and bumps and bruises. Non-contact makes a lot more sense. And you 
don't have the bad rap that hockey has with all the fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Chapey said he believes the San Diego style lends itself to a more exciting 
brand of play. 
</P>
<P>
"We play more of a laid-back game, but the guys love it," Chapey said. "There's 
no stoppage in play for line calls, and it's a faster paced game." 
</P>
<P>
The pace has become even faster in the past couple years with the invention of 
"in-line skates," with the wheels in a straight line so that the look like ice 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
Chapey said the in-line skates are revolutionizing the sport and adding 
interest to it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people that skate down on Mission Beach began wearing in-line skates, 
and we've had a lot of those people join our league," Chapey said. "They 
simulate ice skating pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Chapey, who still wears the conventional-style skate, said there are advantages 
to both. 
</P>
<P>
"The conventional skates are good for stopping and starting and they're more 
stable," he said. "The in lines are faster and better for quick acceleration." 
</P>
<P>
Still, as Joe Mullen said in the March 27 magazine story, roller skating will 
never be exactly like ice skating. 
</P>
<P>
"Roller skating takes a different style from ice skating. You don't glide well. 
In fact, if you don't keep your legs moving, you'll fall on your face. You can 
do almost anything on roller skates that you can do on ice except one thing: On 
roller skates you can't stop." 
</P>
<P>
But, Chapey said, with the new in-line skates, "you can't stop on a dime, but 
you can stop on a quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The only player who isn't required to wear skates in the San Diego league is 
the goalie. Chapey said many of the goalkeepers are former street hockey 
players with little or no skating experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to find goalies in our league," Chapey said. "Many of them are kind 
of flaky and don't last too long." 
</P>
<P>
The other equipment difference between ice and roller hockey is a lighter puck 
-- a hard cover with a plastic filler. The puck weighs three ounces rather than 
the six-ouncer used in ice hockey. It also does less damage than a regular puck 
to the Sweetwater Rink's maple floor, which is covered with a plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
Internationally -- where Chapey said the sport is more popular -- the game is 
played with a field hockey stick and a ball. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, roller hockey rules are governed by the United States Amateur 
Confederation. Chapey is a member of that five-man committee that controls 
roller sports in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
New York is the only city that does adhere to USAC rules. It is also one of the 
few cities which does not participate in the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Hosers, named by Chapey after the insult used by the McKenzie brothers on 
the SCTV television show, finished fifth at the nationals in 1987 and fourth 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger said this year, the Hosers hope for much more. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try and win it all this year," Weidinger said. "We've begun to 
take this thing seriously. Paul has us studying old films, and we're working a 
lot more on game strategy and our passing skills. We're now playing with more 
of a purpose." 
</P>
<P>
But Weidinger said the main purpose is still to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since we changed our name from the Black Hawks to the Hosers in 1983, it 
became more of a fun thing," Weidinger said. 
</P>
<P>
It became such a fun thing that Weidinger, a part-time film producer, is making 
a movie about the trials and tribulations of the Hosers. Weidinger said it will 
not resemble a Walt Disney production. 
</P>
<P>
"It will mostly be about all the wild and crazy things we do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger said you have to be a little off-center just to play roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, you have to be rather nutso to play it," he said. "People look 
at us and say, 'Why are these people playing hockey on roller skates in San 
Diego when they could be doing other things?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Weidinger, a former surfaholic, says there is nothing else he would rather 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in my life," he said, "revolves around what I can do to play roller 
hockey."

NEWLY ARRIVED ABNER IS HAPPY TO JUST LET JACK DO IT IN THE 12TH

<P>
Shawn Abner had more than one reason to be happy when pinch-hitter Jack Clark 
singled home the winning run for the Padres in the 12th inning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just the flush of the Padres' 1-0 victory over Cincinnati that 
brought a smile to Abner's face. The newly arrived outfielder was relieved to 
have been spared the trauma of batting against the submarine pitches of 
43-year-old Kent Tekulve with the game on the line at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Abner, who will be 23 Saturday, was in the on-deck circle when Clark lined 
Tekulve's 3-2 pitch to left field. Mark Parent lumbered home on the hit, and if 
he hadn't made it, Abner would have had to bear a burden that he wasn't quite 
ready for in his first game back from triple-A Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was saying to myself, 'Please get a hit, Jack,' " Abner said. "I've never 
hit against a guy like that. I've always liked to come up in that situation, 
but my first day back, I'd rather have Jack do it." 
</P>
<P>
Abner was recalled from Las Vegas Wednesday after infielder Tim Flannery was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list with a partially torn muscle in his right 
wrist. He didn't play Wednesday night but started in center field Thursday. 
Manager Jack McKeon said he would be platooned with Marvell Wynne for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
This is a crucial test for Abner, who has been a disappointment since he was 
acquired from the New York Mets in December 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After a promising 1987 season, in which he hit .300 at Las Vegas and .277 in a 
September trial with the Padres, Abner made the San Diego club in spring 
training last year. But he hit just .181 in 37 games, was sent back to Las 
Vegas and hit only .254 there, with four home runs and 34 runs batted in in 63 
games. 
</P>
<P>
With those negative numbers on his record, Abner was given a third ticket to 
Las Vegas for 1989. He again failed to tear up the Pacific Coast League, but 
his .269 average in 56 games included eight home runs and 31 RBI, so when 
Flannery got hurt, McKeon gave him another chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find out if he can do it." McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Abner's latest debut didn't prove anything, of course, but it gave cause for 
encouragement to both him and McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Leading off, he had one hit in five at-bats with one strikeout and hit one 
other ball well. In the field, he handled three fly balls without incident. His 
only regrettable act was a base-running gaffe that blunted what might have been 
a game-winning rally in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After leading off the ninth with a single off Rob Dibble, Abner was sacrificed 
to second by Roberto Alomar. Tony Gwynn hit a hot bounder back to John Franco, 
who had replaced Dibble after Abner's hit, and Abner made the mistake of 
straying too far off second. Franco picked him off easily, and Carmelo Martinez 
ended the inning by lining to center. 
</P>
<P>
"He just went a step too far," McKeon said. "But he played OK. He hit the ball 
good. One ball that was caught, he just got under it or it would've been a home 
run." 
</P>
<P>
To McKeon, the most positive aspect of Abner's performance was that he acted as 
though he felt he belonged in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed much more poised, much more relaxed," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a self-assessment, Abner said, "I feel pretty good about the game I 
had. My first time up (against Tom Browning), I just missed getting all of it. 
Another inch, you don't know what might have happened." 
</P>
<P>
And Abner's unfortunate incident at second base? 
</P>
<P>
"The ball was hit so hard, I figured it would go to the left of the pitcher," 
he said. "I had a good lead because I wanted to score and win the ballgame. I 
thought maybe Franco would hesitate or something, but he didn't. I knew then 
that I was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Although he had played 53 major league games previously, Abner admitted that he 
had butterflies when he took the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care whether you've been around 10 years or 30 days," he said. "When 
you've been playing in front of 3,000 people and you see more than 20 grand in 
the stands, you get a little nervous." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that Abner will be around only until Flannery comes back, but he 
is determined to make his stay permanent this time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was here last year, I played about every five days," he said. "Now I 
just want a chance to prove myself. I'm going to bust my butt for 15 days and 
see what happens."

A Woman of Singular Occupation by Penelope Gilliatt (Scribners: $17.95; 180 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Known for her incisive New Yorker film reviews, the wry and worldly script for 
"Sunday Bloody Sunday," five distinguished short story collections, four prior 
novels and a variety of essays and criticism, Penelope Gilliatt appears here in 
another persona altogether. The easy and natural dialogue of her earlier 
fiction has been supplanted by sentences that yield their meaning only after 
the third re-reading, and then grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the heroine, Catherine, explaining the magic of the Orient Express to 
her lover, Thomas. "Oh dove, that train. It's stood for so great a change in 
us. All the way through the 19th Century it was something purely thought, 
something true, an expression of a real belief in the perfectibility of man. 
But now here we are, having proved ourselves to be so imperfect that the 
species has spawned the Nazis. The tonic fact is that a great many men and 
women haven't allowed themselves to be jaded" -- and this is pillow talk; the 
heroine unrehearsed and at her most spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absolutely Impenetrable 
</P>
<P>
Catherine in public can be absolutely impenetrable. "The discovery of the 
essential tuning solution that the seven semitones of a perfect fifth should 
not be tuned as 7 but as 7.109550008654. The brilliant tiny difference called 
the Pythagorean comma" -- a mouthful calculated to challenge the verbal gifts 
of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Catherine, of course, is not only an 
extraordinarily gifted musician, but also a foreign agent. Still, a novel is 
meant to be read, not decoded. 
</P>
<P>
The plot begins straightforwardly enough, but soon becomes so entangled, opaque 
and confused that it actually defies description. Though usually the reviewer 
must struggle to avoid giving away the resolution of an espionage novel, in 
this case the risks are negligible. Only the author knows what really happened, 
and she has apparently decided to keep some of the crucial secrets to herself. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine de Rochefauld is the dazzlingly beautiful and formidably talented 
wife of the French ambassador to Turkey. The year is 1939, and the novel opens 
as she is traveling alone to Istanbul on the Orient Express. Her husband is an 
ardent supporter of the Vichy government. For some time now, Catherine has 
shared neither his politics nor his bed. Thomas Drake, a young American banker 
posted to Istanbul, sees Catherine on that most romantic of trains and is 
instantly smitten. Although a passionate affair immediately ensues, Thomas is 
disturbed by Catherine's mysterious errands, frequent disappearances and 
elliptical allusions to dark secrets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sympathetic Character 
</P>
<P>
Only 28 years old, far from home and totally bewildered by events around him, 
Thomas is by far the most sympathetic character in the book. His predicament is 
at least perfectly understandable, while everyone else's remains obscure. 
Catherine has an American friend, Ann Wisner, who shares her fondness for 
elevated discourse and also seems to have come to a similar sort of 
understanding with her Turkish husband, Kemal. 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious fortune teller, Hilda, is less easily definable; a pity, because 
she plays a pivotal role in the novel. Her profession entitles her to speak 
even more circumlocutiously than anyone else, which is saying a lot. Regardless 
of nationality or proficiency in English, everyone in the novel attempts to 
speak in Catherine's lofty style, a technical feat beyond them all. 
</P>
<P>
Vital codes are hidden in shoes and transmitted by wireless to De Gaulle; 
people are exposed to terrible dangers, missions are accomplished and the war 
is finally over. Suddenly, we're in the 1980s, and Thomas Drake is a 
74-year-old nuclear physicist. He has never forgotten Catherine and those 
wonderful years in Istanbul, and miracle of miracles, the last 2 1/2 pages are 
as clear and to the point as anything Gilliatt ever wrote for the New Yorker.

BRITISH GIVE UP, BRAND COLD FUSION A 'MAD IDEA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that virtually buries hopes for cold fusion, the British Atomic 
Energy Authority said Thursday it has abandoned efforts to replicate a 
controversial Utah experiment and branded claims of achieving fusion-in-a-flask 
"a mad idea." 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Britain's Harwell Laboratory is particularly significant 
because one of the scientists who made the startling announcement in Salt Lake 
City last March is a consultant to the lab and made materials he had used in 
the Utah research available to his British colleagues. In addition, the 
scientist, Milton Fleischmann, worked with the Harwell team in an effort to 
repeat the results he claimed to have achieved with fellow electrochemist B. 
Stanley Pons of the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Ten scientists worked full time at the lab, located near Oxford, and more than 
100 others participated from time to time, according to David Williams, who 
headed the effort. In all, they tried 125 variations of the experiment over a 
three-month period and spent more than $486,000. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, their highly sophisticated instruments detected no excess heat, 
which would have demonstrated the energy-producing potential of the experiment, 
and they found no neutrons, which would have proved that fusion was taking 
place. 
</P>
<P>
It all added up to a devastating blow to cold fusion enthusiasts, because it 
was widely believed that Harwell, with Fleischmann's full cooperation, had the 
best chance of confirming the Utah experiment, which had held the promise of 
ending the planet's energy woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply have to stop because we can't think of anything else to do at the 
moment," Williams told reporters Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the experiments "clearly documented" that cold fusion was not 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
In a reference to Fleischmann, he added: "When brilliant people have mad ideas 
it can come down on them like a ton of bricks. What's happened here is that a 
brilliant man has had a mad idea." 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann was "out of town" for a couple of days and could not be reached, 
according to a man who answered the phone at his London residence. Pons could 
not be reached in Salt Lake City, either. The University of Utah said he is in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
But James J. Brophy, vice president for research at the University of Utah, 
said the university continued to support the claims of Pons and Fleischmann. 
Brophy said he was "at a loss to explain" why Fleischmann's colleagues in 
England could not repeat the experiment even though they had a palladium 
electrode supplied by Fleischmann. The electrode was part of a simple table-top 
experiment that the University of Utah had claimed offered a "clean, virtually 
inexhaustible source of energy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointment in Utah 
</P>
<P>
"It is disappointing that they have not been able to do the experiment 
properly," Brophy said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The startling announcement last March sent shock waves through the scientific 
world. Thousands of experts around the globe dropped whatever they were doing 
and turned their attention to the experiment, although most scientists were 
skeptical from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, a number of laboratories and institutions worldwide reported partial 
confirmation of the Utah experiment, although no one was able to duplicate all 
the results claimed by Pons and Fleischmann. 
</P>
<P>
Why some have claimed partial success while many others have failed remains a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, reported confirmation of the 
experiment, only to have to back off days later and admit failure. 
</P>
<P>
But others, including scientists and engineers at Texas A&amp;M and Stanford 
University, have reported results that so far have defied explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting positive results," said A. John Appleby, director of the 
electrochemical center at Texas A&amp;M. But the results are not always the 
same, adding more mystery to what will surely rank as one of the most unusual 
chapters in the history of science. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Appleby said in a telephone interview Thursday, the electrodes 
produce tritium -- a byproduct of fusion -- but other scientists with identical 
electrodes on other parts of the College Station campus are unable to get the 
same results. Some experiments at Texas A&amp;M have also produced excess heat, 
but other experiments on the same campus have not. 
</P>
<P>
"Something seems to be happening" that does not conform to conventional 
understanding of either chemistry or physics, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I believe in cold fusion," he said, "but we have heating we 
can't explain by normal means." 
</P>
<P>
Other research institutions, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, have 
reported some evidence of fusion in electrodes like those used by Pons and 
Fleischmann, but not nearly on a scale that would suggest that the process has 
any application in the production of energy. Instead, the Los Alamos results 
tend to support the far less extravagant claims of another Utah scientist, 
Steven E. Jones of Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
Jones claims that he has caused atoms of deuterium -- a heavy form of hydrogen 
-- to fuse in a palladium electrode, but the reaction is very weak and does not 
produce excess heat. There is growing support for Jones' work, although most 
physicists are still mystified over how fusion could occur unless it is heated 
to temperatures equivalent to the core of the sun. Jones, as well as Pons and 
Fleischmann, have claimed that fusion occurred at room temperature when an 
electric current was passed through an electrode immersed in water that had 
been enriched with deuterium. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Pons and Fleischmann, Jones does not claim that his experiment can 
ever be used to produce energy. 
</P>
<P>
The March announcement by Pons and Fleischmann during a Salt Lake City press 
conference sent scientists scurrying to their laboratories, since both men had 
solid reputations in electrochemistry even if they were a bit out of their 
field in claiming to have achieved a historic breakthrough in physics. What 
followed was a bizarre series of events. 
</P>
<P>
Because Pons and Fleischmann used a magic word -- fusion -- to explain a 
process they admitted they did not fully understand, it set off a chain 
reaction among scientists who have long dreamed of harnessing the energy that 
powers the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Had they not claimed that the heat they were seeing was produced by fusion, 
noted UCLA nuclear engineer Robert Conn, "none of this brouhaha would have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing Signature 
</P>
<P>
The problem for physicists from the beginning was that none of the signatures 
of fusion were present. Had fusion been taking place, for example, it should 
have produced a lethal dose of neutrons. 
</P>
<P>
When other scientists pointed that out, Pons and Fleischmann responded that the 
fusion was mysteriously benign -- creating four times as much energy as it 
consumed, but not producing the dangerous byproducts associated with fusion. 
</P>
<P>
That meant that other scientists had to search for a mysterious nuclear 
reaction that did not carry the normal signature of fusion. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, men such as UCLA's Conn were saying that the chase had ended. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann may have seen something that convinced them that they were 
producing energy from fusion, he said, but it was not fusion. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental signature isn't there," Conn added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, halfway around the world, the scientist who directed the Harwell 
lab's effort and has worked with Fleischmann for years spoke of the burden that 
will have to be carried by a friend who came up with a "mad idea." 
</P>
<P>
"Martin Fleischmann is a very, very clever man and he has these ideas all the 
time," David Williams told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But "not every mad idea works out. Maybe this one has, and maybe it hasn't. It 
certainly hasn't worked out for us. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the sad thing is that there has been this amazing, hysterical 
overreaction, certainly in America."

AIRPORT CHIEF QUESTIONS 2 MINORITY PACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The chief of the city's Department of Airports has ordered a review of two 
multimillion-dollar food service contracts whose partners include several 
politically well-connected minority leaders, among them Los Angeles Urban 
League President John Mack and church leader H. H. Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
The review will center on whether concession agreements, awarded under a 
program to increase participation of disadvantaged minorities and women in city 
contracts, provide for the minority partners a clearly defined, hands-on role 
in the running of the concessions. Such a role is required by both city and 
federal government contract guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking what have they done, what are their plans for the future and how 
have they met the (minority participation) objectives," said Clifton Moore, the 
department's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements are between the city and Host International Inc., a subsidiary 
of the Marriott Corp., and eight minority partners. The contracts cover 
operations of cafeterias and other food services at Los Angeles and Ontario 
international airports. According to public records and interviews with Host 
and others, the minority participants receive a share of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
The business activity of the minority partners varies from attending board 
meetings to recruiting employees, according to interviews with participants. 
</P>
<P>
Mack said he does not spend a lot of time involved with the food service 
concessions. He said it was management's responsibility to handle employee and 
payroll matters. Brookins was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Martinez-Zapata, another of the minority partners, said: "(Host) told us 
they were looking for a group to advise their management committee. This was 
not ever intended to be a hands-on type of management." 
</P>
<P>
Airport Commissioner Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who has sought more minority and 
women's participation in airport concession partnerships, said of the cafeteria 
contract: "My idea is there needs to be hands-on participation. I think as part 
of the deal (the minority partners) should actually be running the food 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
The move to review the food and beverage contracts at city-owned Los Angeles 
International and Ontario airports comes after news reports this week about 
contracts for gift shop concessions with other minority and women partners, 
including the wife of House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles). Dixon, who has denied any improprieties, reported that his wife 
collected at least $150,000 over the last two years for her participation in a 
joint venture partnership with Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. Partnership. Betty 
Dixon acknowledged in an interview with The Times that she had limited 
involvement in the operation and had invested no more than $15,000 in the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Moore asked Duty Free for a written explanation of what functions 
the minority partners perform in the gift shops and news concession operations. 
Moore said that Betty Dixon's portrayal of her responsibilities in the airport 
concessions does "not seem to be consistent" with the minority participation 
program approved by the department. 
</P>
<P>
As for the cafeteria concessions, The Times has learned that airport officials, 
including Moore, had some reservations about the contracts involving the 
minority partners even as the contracts were being renewed, without competitive 
bidding, by the Airport Commission in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to renew its food and beverage contracts at the two city-owned airports, 
Host sought out women and minority partners to increase its chances. 
</P>
<P>
Internal memos show that Barbara Williams, who heads the airport's minority 
business program, began warning commissioners and managers at the time that 
proposed contracts did not clearly define a business role for the minority 
partners, as required by city and federal guidelines. Federal guidelines apply 
because the airport received federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Transportation Department lawyer Robert Ashby told The Times on Thursday 
that federal rules require minority participants to be more than passive 
investors or merely attend board of directors meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual has to be there (on the job site) a fair amount of time, has to 
talk to the people to whom jobs are delegated, has to be performing as what a 
reasonable person would think a manager in touch with a business should be 
doing," Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
The minority partners brought into the cafeteria contracts by Host include 
Mack, a longtime supporter of Mayor Tom Bradley; Brookins, a politically active 
bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church who helped launched Bradley's 
career; Martinez-Zapata, a former aide to Bradley and fund-raiser for 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina; and attorney and restaurateur Andy M. Camacho, a 
close political ally of Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
The other partners are: Ernest M. Camacho, a Pasadena businessman and brother 
of Andy Camacho; Earl E. Gales Jr., a partner in Jenkins-Gales-Martinez Inc., a 
Los Angeles architectural and engineering firm; Treva D. Metoyer, a Lynwood 
businesswoman, and Luis C. Valenzuela, a real estate developer and fund-raiser 
for Molina, Alatorre and other Eastside politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Host formed -- and the Airport Commission approved -- the first joint 
venture to boost minority involvement in its $4.4-million-a-year concession 
contract at the Ontario airport. That group involved all of the partners except 
Brookins and Mack. The two men were added in 1988, when Host received 
commission approval for a similar arrangement to share in $49 million in annual 
cafeteria sales at Los Angeles airport. 
</P>
<P>
According to airport records and interviews with Host and four of the eight 
partners, the minorities were not required to put any cash into the venture. 
They each received a varying share of the concession business and they are 
guaranteed payments from the profits 13 times a year. These payments range from 
$13,000 a year (to Mack) to more than $65,000 a year (to Brookins), according 
to Host. The payments are expected to increase as sales rise. The concessions 
at the two airports grossed more than $53 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts provide for minority partners to get minimum payments or a 
percentage of the profits, whichever is larger, according to Mack. 
</P>
<P>
The minority partners attend quarterly management meetings primarily to listen 
to reports by Host executives on the food concessions business and recruit 
minority vendors and employees to Host, according to interviews and public 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The time the partners have devoted to the business varies. Mack said that he 
spends "maybe a couple of hours a month" on the business, attending meetings, 
making phone calls and writing letters. "Clearly, it has not consumed an 
inordinate amount of my time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Brookins moved to Washington last summer he has attended few management 
meetings, two partners said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gales said he works up to 40 hours a month on the concession business, 
mainly making telephone calls and recruiting potential employees. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's Williams said she expressed her concerns about the lack of a 
direct participation plan to her superiors as the Host contracts came up for 
renewal. But Gary Netzer, the senior assistant city attorney in charge of 
airports, said the degree of participation was a policy decision for the 
Airport Commission to make. 
</P>
<P>
Other airport managers, including Moore, maintained in interviews that they 
shared some of Williams' concerns. Moore said the issue was "sort of a value 
judgment" for the Airport Commission to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran said those concerns were never expressed to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable airport source, who asked not to be identified, said some 
airport officials suppressed their concerns because of the "sensitivity" of 
Anglo-led airport management criticizing a business arrangement designed to 
increase minority participation. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the mayor's office said it also shares concerns that the 
contracts lack meaningful minority participation and may not meet city 
guidelines. "Somebody made a mistake," said Deputy Mayor Michael Gage, who 
added that the minority partners should be involved in the concession 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In its role as overseer of all city minority-contracting programs, the mayor's 
office was making inquiries about the status of the contracts, records show. 
One memo describes the office's concerns that it was not being kept fully 
apprised. However, there is no indication that Bradley himself intervened in 
any way. 
</P>
<P>
Mack said he does not believe that hands-on involvement is necessary to learn 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not hiring or firing anybody," Mack said. "I'm not doing the payroll. That 
is what we have (Host) management to do. . . . It may not be the best approach, 
but it is a beginning step in the direction of trying to correct some past 
inequities."

3 SENTENCED TO DIE FOR BURNING SHANGHAI TRAIN 
</P>

<P>
China's crackdown on demonstrators in the pro-democracy movement escalated 
Thursday when authorities sentenced to death three men accused of torching a 
train during a protest in Shanghai early last week. 
</P>
<P>
The three were part of an angry mob that attacked the Beijing-Shanghai Express 
on the night of June 6 after the train plowed through a crowd blocking the 
tracks, killing six people, state-run Shanghai Television said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide television announced the arrests of two more fugitive pro-democracy 
leaders named on recently publicized lists and broadcast scenes of a show trial 
of 26 protesters in the northeastern city of Changchun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protesters Blocked Tracks 
</P>
<P>
Although the circumstances of the train accident and subsequent fire in 
Shanghai are not entirely clear, it appeared that protesters were blocking the 
tracks in part of a citywide civil disobedience campaign to halt public 
transportation in a protest of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Beijing the previous weekend. Students and workers erected 
barricades across Shanghai that snarled traffic and nearly shut down the city 
from June 5 through June 7. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have described the initial incident in official news reports as a 
"traffic accident." They denounced as "hooligans" those who set fire to the 
train and allegedly attacked railway security officials and firemen attempting 
to douse the flames. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the climax of protests in Shanghai, China's most populous 
city, as citizens reacted to reports that hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
people were killed when the army shot its way into central Beijing on the night 
of June 3-4 to clear pro-democracy protesters from Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji defused the situation with a conciliatory June 8 
speech reassuring citizens that the military would not be called into Shanghai. 
City officials then hired hundreds of worker "volunteers" to remove 
commandeered buses blocking major intersections and to patrol the streets. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 23 people have been reported arrested in the train incident, out of 
more than 150 students and workers detained in Shanghai in connection with 
protests and more than 1,000 arrests nationwide. Thursday's verdicts were the 
first death sentences made public in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television showed the three men in court listening impassively to the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"Their crime is very serious," the judge was quoted as saying. "We will punish 
them heavily and as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The men were given three days to file appeals. Death sentences in China are 
sometimes suspended for a period, and may be changed to life imprisonment upon 
good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency identified the men as Xu Guoming, a worker 
at a Shanghai brewery; Bian Hanwu, an unemployed worker, and Yan Xuerong, a 
worker at a Shanghai radio factory. It was not clear whether the three men had 
been protest leaders, or whether they simply were unlucky enough to be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The New China News Agency portrayed their actions as purely criminal, making no 
mention of the protesters killed by the train or the political context. 
</P>
<P>
"On the evening of June 6, when a traffic accident took place at the Guangxin 
railway crossing, the three criminals and other scoundrels frenziedly smashed 
the railway carriages and set fire to police motorcycles and the carriages," 
the news agency said. "They also prevented firefighters from extinguishing the 
fire and beat them cruelly." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants in the Changchun trial were shown on television with their heads 
shaven, being led by police onto a stage in front of a crowd in a packed hall. 
The men were accused of having "stopped traffic and advocated a strike among 
workers." Placards hanging around the necks of some of them gave their names 
and accused them of instigating social unrest and spreading rumors. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television also showed scenes of detainees being led into police 
stations in the painful posture called "the airplane position" -- arms wrenched 
behind and in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Television news reported that Xiong Wei, 23, a Qinghua University student who 
was one of 21 student leaders included in a most-wanted list broadcast 
nationwide Tuesday gave himself up to authorities at the urging of his mother. 
He was shown being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested was Liu Qiang, a leader of the Beijing Autonomous Workers Union. 
Liu was shown in handcuffs being taken off a train in Inner Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian press, quoting anonymous sources, has reported that another 
fugitive student leader, Chai Ling, 23, a graduate psychology student at 
Beijing Teachers University, has been given refuge inside the Australian 
Embassy in Beijing. Chai had disappeared a few days before the June 3-4 army 
crackdown, after saying that she had decided to go into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Australian officials have declined to comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
China's most famous pro-democracy advocate, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, and his 
wife, Li Shuxian, a Beijing University physics professor, have been granted 
refuge inside the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. action, confirmed by officials in 
Washington, has prompted bitter criticism in the Chinese media. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese media also have bitterly attacked the Voice of America for its 
reporting on the pro-democracy protests and their suppression. The New China 
News Agency continued these attacks with a report issued early today repeating 
its assertion that the U.S. government-funded station "has ceaselessly created 
various rumors on the student unrest, turmoil and counterrevolutionary 
rebellion" in China. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its reports showing the full force of China's security apparatus 
employed against the dissidents, the television news has been filled with 
reports praising the soldiers who imposed martial law on Beijing against the 
resistance of huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese Red Cross, which had displayed considerable 
sympathy for the student protesters, had initially reported 2,600 deaths in the 
June 3-4 massacre. 
</P>
<P>
The government, for its part, at first said that only about 300 people had 
died, then reduced the official figure Wednesday to about 200. Under martial 
law regulations in Beijing, it now is an illegal act of "spreading rumors" for 
Chinese citizens to say that more people died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Red Cross Retracts Figure 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Red Cross issued a statement Thursday retracting its previous 
figure, which had been issued orally to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Cross Society of China has never published any figures about the 
deaths in the June 4 incident in Beijing," a spokesman told the New China News 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also referred to reports that a senior official of the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry recently cited the 2,600 figure and attributing it to the 
Chinese Red Cross. The Red Cross spokesman said Thursday that this figure "does 
not conform to reality and is sheer fabrication," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Gruesome scenes were broadcast Thursday of soldiers using shovels to remove the 
charred remains of six soldiers who were killed by crowds that blocked their 
truck during the night of June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Infuriated crowds did kill some soldiers and police officers -- nearly 100 by 
official count -- while resisting the army's advance. Some corpses were doused 
with gasoline and set afire. In one incident, the charred body of a soldier was 
hung from a pedestrian overpass. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong was shown on television Thursday offering words of 
comfort to the mother of this soldier. 
</P>
<P>
"Your child is very glorious," Chen said. "Thank you for having such a good son 
who died for the defense of the Communist Party leadership, the motherland and 
the capital." 
</P>

LAPD RAID DID LITTLE GOOD, THEY SAY; 
</P>
<P>
ON 47TH PLACE, RESIDENTS LIVE WITH DRUG SCOURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer, 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nighttime is the worst, said the 39-year-old school custodian and mother of 
four as she quieted her infant son in a corner of her lightless living room, 
careful to avoid the window and the possibility of being struck by a stray 
bullet from a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime, she said, is when the crack cocaine dealers come in droves to sell 
their "rocks" from the porches and yards on her block of 47th Place, an 
otherwise quiet street of bungalows between Central and Hoover avenues just 
south of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ask them not hang around in front of your house, or at least not to do their 
business from the porch of an aged, invalid lady who lives on the block, the 
woman said, and they may go away for a while. Or they may not. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I come home from work at night I want to cry because I have to come 
on this street," said the woman who, like all residents interviewed, requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 100 Los Angeles police officers -- inspired by neighborhood 
complaints, led by Chief Daryl F. Gates and armed with search warrants and a 
battering ram -- swooped along the street, crashing through windows and walls 
of 10 houses at one end of the block. They arrested four men -- two for 
allegedly selling cocaine and two for allegedly possessing small amounts of 
marijuana. Police also seized 74 grams of cocaine, five guns, a police scanner 
radio and $222 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the raids, which police ballyhooed as but "one step in 
eradicating this neighborhood of dope dealers," some people who live along 47th 
Place talked with a reporter about their street and the frightening way it came 
to accommodate what one narcotics officer said may well be the largest 
concentration of crack dealing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
They told how in the last two years, Crips gang members called Four Treys have 
converged on the block each evening from other parts of the neighborhood, 
apparently attracted to the relatively serene and out-of-the-way setting it 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
"About two years ago, you could sleep with your door open," said a woman who 
lives on the block. "You sit out there now and you are liable to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
At first there were only a few dealers, and they congregated on one corner. 
Then they began to move down the block. They started dealing on sidewalks where 
children play, and then they camped out on porches -- apparently because it 
afforded a shady place to sit. Eventually, residents said, some gang members 
actually rented houses on the street, increasing the drug-buying traffic. The 
entrenchment was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Just how many gang members live in houses on the block, and how many merely 
operate off front porches, remains a matter of contention between police and 
47th Place residents. No one, though, disputes that drug-dealing is epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is a Gang Street' 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it, but this is a gang street and a dope street," said one 
resident, a slightly built, middle-aged woman. "But how do I look trying to 
make these gangsters leave? They're not even afraid of the police." 
</P>
<P>
"It has gotten to the point where it is a part of life," said a 21-year-old 
tenant. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, most of whom are renters, said the late-night raid a week ago 
Wednesday was a welcome -- but misdirected -- attack on the problem. The 
raiders, several residents said in interviews, in some cases went to the wrong 
houses, arrested the wrong people and did not seem to understand fully the 
dynamics of drug commerce on their block. And finally, they said, the raid 
accomplished little. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as residents shared their story, drug dealers already were 
returning to 47th Place, brazenly selling their crack for as little as $1 a 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from residents began to pour in to police less than 24 hours after 
the raid, said Lt. Lindsey Harmon of the Police Department's Central Division 
narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policeman Agrees 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a 23-year police veteran who participated in the raids, agreed with 
47th Place residents that the crack sellers on their block are gang members, 
but he contended that a gang could not operate there as it does without 
assistance from at least some residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reason to believe that sellers pay some of the people for use of their 
houses" to stash their cocaine, he said. "If you are in a tight financial 
situation and someone offers you three or four hundred dollars, it might be 
better for you" than welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon acknowledged that he has no concrete proof to support such a theory, but 
he pointed out that undercover officers, during a monthlong investigation that 
preceded the raid, made "controlled buys" outside each of the 10 houses. 
</P>
<P>
"The seller got the narcotics from inside the house in all 10 cases, every one 
of them," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the narratives offered by police and people who live on 47th 
Place take contradictory paths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police See a Victory 
</P>
<P>
Police cast the raid as a victory against, as a department press release put 
it, "the criminals who are destroying the country and particularly the cities 
of our nation by engaging in the sales of narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that one suspect fired at officers as he escaped -- no 
one was hit -- and it offered the seizure of the police scanner radio as 
evidence of the sophistication of the gang dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, however, said the raid missed its target. They said the vast 
majority of drug sales on the block occur on the porches and in the yards, not 
from inside houses. There is no doubt that some of the homes are occupied by 
crack sellers, they said, but they contend that at least five of those went 
untouched by police last week, while officers raided homes occupied by 
law-abiding people. 
</P>
<P>
"They broke into my father's house down the street and I can tell you that he 
don't sell no dope," said one woman, who described her father as a 70-year-old 
retiree. 
</P>
<P>
She complained that a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old in the house at the time were 
forced to lie face-down on the floor while police searched the home. The 
father, who the woman said was not arrested in the raid, could not be located 
for comment. Another daughter, who lives with him, would not talk to a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The police press release said a man identified as Jack Davis Palmer was 
arrested in the house the night of the raid for allegedly having marijuana -- 
less than an ounce -- on his person. Harmon said Palmer was later given a court 
date and released. No cocaine was found. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing occurred at a three-bedroom house that is owned by 105-year-old 
Martin Jones. Police found no cocaine in the house, but did arrest a man they 
said had a small amount of marijuana. He was identified as Leonel Lloyd Lewis. 
The disposition of his case could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a minister who lives in another section of the city, was at the house 
this week, trying to repair broken windows, window frames and torn-away 
security bars so he can rent the home again. 
</P>
<P>
His tenant of five years, he said, moved out of the house the night of the 
raid, after police broke through the windows and handcuffed her. 
</P>
<P>
"She had never been in handcuffs before," Jones said. "She moved out the same 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the woman was involved in drug dealing, Jones considered 
the question for a moment and shook his head: "Of course, I could be wrong," he 
said, "but I never saw nothing like that." 
</P>
<P>
He described the woman as an active member of his church who had been a 
candidate for the ministry until she became pregnant with the first of her two 
children. He is considering filing a formal complaint against police for 
damaging his property and raiding the wrong house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they have to do their jobs," Jones said, referring to the officers who 
conducted the raid, "but they don't have to tear up things like this." 
</P>
<P>
As he talked, a young man bounded up the stairs of the house and asked Jones if 
he could rent it. "I got the money, right now. I got it right now," the younger 
man said urgently, after Jones told him he probably already had a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the same man was seen standing in the middle of street 
waving cash in his hand. Why he was waving money around was not clear. He wore 
what authorities describe as a classic gang uniform: a black Los Angeles 
Raiders cap and a blue sweat shirt with blue shorts drooping on his hips. 
</P>
<P>
The man would not answer questions about himself, but he taunted the police. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get nothing (in the raids) but two guns," he said laughing. "Tell 
them that they might as well make dope legal."

Accusing him of using tactics from the Spanish Inquisition, the Assembly's 
leading Republican publicly upbraided Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) Thursday 
for "harassing" Assembly Republicans during budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, in an unusual speech to the full Senate minutes later, accused Ross 
Johnson of La Habra of making anti-Semitic remarks to him and said that such 
"absolutely disgusting conduct by the leader of Assembly Republicans is not in 
the realm of something that can be excused or tolerated by a member of our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins drew immediate support from Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman 
of the joint Assembly-Senate budget conference committee, who deplored 
Johnson's conduct as "totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Utter Nonsense' 
</P>
<P>
Johnson then hurried into the Senate chamber and denied to reporters that he 
made any anti-Semitic statements. "That's nonsense, utter nonsense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he had made a "joking" reference to "Sen. Torquemada" as he strode 
into the conference committee to complain about Robbins' rough treatment of 
Assembly Republicans who appeared before the committee to plead for funding for 
their pet projects. Tomas de Torquemada was the grand inquisitor during the 
Spanish Inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who is Jewish, said the reference was anti-Semitic because it was 
Torquemada who played a key role in expelling Jews from Spain in the 15th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Second Reference 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, senator," Johnson said during the committee session, "I should have 
referred to Sammy Glick." Glick was a character in Budd Schulberg's 1941 novel, 
"What Makes Sammy Run," who was portrayed as a ruthless movie mogul who was 
Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson entered the Senate chamber, he was surrounded by both Republicans 
and Democrats, some of whom moments before had hugged and embraced an emotional 
Robbins. Johnson said he came to "confront" Robbins directly, but Robbins 
apparently had departed. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 minutes later, Johnson issued a statement to the press and called 
Robbins a "bully who had intimidated our (Republican) members unmercifully all 
day." But he insisted, "If I inadvertently said anything that could be 
misinterpreted in that manner, I most sincerely apologize and would 
unhesitatingly apologize to Sen. Robbins." 
</P>
<P>
An angry Johnson said he decided to face Robbins in the conference committee 
after he heard that the senator had been accusing Republicans of engaging in a 
conspiracy several weeks ago to block a Robbins insurance bill. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins complained that the Republicans used parliamentary procedures to kill 
the bill that would have imposed stiff fines on insurance companies that tried 
to escape provisions of Proposition 103 by mass cancellations of California 
policyholders. The initiative, approved by the voters in November, requires 
insurers to reduce rates. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect to participate in that type of conspiracy and expect to come 
here and have this particular conferee be receptive . . . to your request," 
Robbins told one Assembly Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans denied there had been any conspiracy. Johnson said the bill had 
been voted down twice in the Assembly and Republicans saw no need to bring it 
up a third time. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire your tenacity," he told Robbins, "but I don't admire at all your 
harassing individual members of my caucus. . . just because they voted against 
a bill that you authored." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the exchange between Robbins and Johnson, the decorous proceedings 
of the six-member conference committee had turned into a donnybrook when 
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) threatened to block funding for 
rural parks. She said that since suburban and rural legislators are pushing 
legislation to take school funding away from inner-city school districts, it 
would only be fair to do the same thing with their park money. 
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks as Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge) argued 
for funding to acquire parkland in the Santa Susanna Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) many of your constituents enjoy these mountains," La Follette protested. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what my constituents enjoy," Waters snapped. "Every time you 
want some more money for the mountains, you say that. . . . You would like to 
think that, but let me tell you, they don't." 
</P>
<P>
The conferees are expected to take at least a week to negotiate a compromise on 
the state's $50-billion budget.

GILLESPIE, HAYDEN INCH TOWARD RACE; 
</P>
<P>
BOTH TAKE STEPS TO BECOME FIRST ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

Taking her most definite steps yet toward running for state insurance 
commissioner when it becomes an elective post next year, Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie has filed a "candidate intention statement" with the 
California Fair Political Practices Commission and scheduled at least three 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said 
Thursday that Hayden is forming an exploratory committee "to take a good 
serious look at the insurance commissioner's position." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gillespie, a Republican, and Hayden, a Democrat, are probably the most 
widely known of the prospective candidates for the state's newest elective 
office, several others have been making political noises as the opening moves 
are made in the developing race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others in the Race 
</P>
<P>
Among these are State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis, television 
commentator Bill Press, tort reform activist Tom Skornia, trial attorney Ray 
Bourhis and insurance agent Frank Thomas. All except Skornia are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gillespie nor Hayden said Thursday that they are committed at this 
point to being candidates, and neither set a date for finally making a 
decision. But in separate interviews both said they are seriously exploring the 
possibility of running. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, who until recently had disavowed any intention of being a candidate, 
has been Gov. George Deukmejian's appointed insurance commissioner since June, 
1986, and recently, as a result of the passage of Proposition 103 and her 
responsibility for deciding which insurance companies will be subject to rate 
rollbacks, has been much in the public limelight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State of Campaign Organization 
</P>
<P>
She said in an interview that she has scheduled an initial Southern California 
fund-raising event June 28 under the leadership of Peter Caloyeras, president 
of Axios, a Greek-American association. Gillespie was born in Greece and has 
been making a number of calls in California's Greek community in recent weeks 
to form a base of support. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner noted that state election laws require that a candidate 
intention statement be filed before any money is raised. She also this week 
filed a statement of campaign organization with California Secretary of State 
March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case, running would be a big step," Gillespie said. "I have to think 
about it. I don't know enough about the process." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden declared, "On the recommendation of some of my long-time friends and 
advisers, I've agreed to explore the question of running for commissioner more 
formally, although I still have a lot of reservations about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not speak out on insurance issues until I've made a decision to run. If 
I start speaking out, it'll look like I'm running . . . and that would only 
create momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden aide Bill Schulz said that while an exploratory committee of five to 10 
people is being organized, Hayden is not filing a candidate intention statement 
at this point because he does not intend to be raising any money during the 
exploratory period. 
</P>
<P>
Schulz said Hayden had been contacted by "people within the insurance industry" 
and would be meeting with them as well as with consumer representatives during 
his exploration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Skirmishing 
</P>
<P>
Already, meanwhile, there is some political skirmishing between prospective 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Collis, for example, took credit Thursday for prodding Gillespie into a 
somewhat more flexible position on the standards she will use in judging 
whether insurance companies will be forced to give their customers rate 
rollbacks and rebates as called for in Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, until recently, had said she would reach these judgments separately 
for each line of insurance sold by each company. Then, after an exchange of 
correspondence between her department and Collis, she indicated that in some 
cases she might make a collective judgment based on all of a company's lines 
affected by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner said she has not made up her mind yet about a change 
of standards and is not even sure such a change would benefit consumers. But 
Collis said Thursday that he is convinced she will begin bending more toward 
consumers now that she is thinking of becoming a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"Her tactics will be to grant 20% rollbacks and then have companies come in and 
sue her," Collis said. "Then, it will seem she's not in their corner anymore. 
That's sure to be her tactic. She's unquestionably doing that for political 
reasons, but I don't care. What's important is that consumers obtain their 
rollbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Collis' remarks, Gillespie shot back, "Conway Collis has not prodded me 
to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to be as professional as I possibly can about this. Whatever 
I do, I want it to be upheld by the courts, if it comes to that. The whole 
nation is going to be watching what we do here in California, and I want to do 
the right thing, not the political thing." 
</P>
<P>
Press, meanwhile, said he has gone farther toward running than any of the other 
prospective candidates, hiring both a campaign manager, David Mixner, and a 
fund-raising consultant, Joann Ruden. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised there are not even more candidates yet, because I believe this 
is a very important post," he said. "It's a unique opportunity to create a 
consumer advocate for Californians. That's why I'm interested in it." 
</P>
<P>
Press earlier in the week had accused Gillespie of contacting Greek diplomatic 
representatives in California for help in raising money for a race. Gillespie 
denied doing so.

GORBACHEV ENDS TRIP, OFFERING HOPE THAT BERLIN WALL CAN COME DOWN

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended his landmark visit to West Germany 
on Thursday, offering the hope that the Berlin Wall will come down one day and 
divided Germany will be reunited. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also told a closing news conference that the Soviet Union sees a role 
for the United States in what he refers to as the "common European home," in 
which the divisions between East and West will fade away. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an understanding both in the East and the West of the role of the 
United States in Europe," he told about 600 reporters here. "I can't imagine a 
realistic policy of the Soviet leadership that would have the objective of 
pushing the United States out of Europe, of hampering the interests of the 
United States in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smooth Performance 
</P>
<P>
In his news conference, Gorbachev appeared to be trying both to raise German 
hopes and calm German fears in what observers said was a very smooth 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Challenged about West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's charge that, with the 
improvement of East-West relations, the Berlin Wall is an "unacceptable symbol" 
of the Cold War, the Soviet leader replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is eternal in this world. The Wall appeared in a certain situation and 
not as a result of an evil intention. . . . The Wall could disappear once the 
conditions that generated it disappear." 
</P>
<P>
In his view, Gorbachev said, the Berlin Wall is not "the sole barrier between 
East and West. We must improve many situations in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about German reunification, Gorbachev responded in somewhat vague terms, 
declaring: "The situation in Europe was shaped by our postwar realities. 
Everything is quite possible, but this is the world we have, and time should 
decide." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that he was referring to a time when East-West tensions would 
subside significantly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Share an Understanding' 
</P>
<P>
As he elaborated: "We welcome the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany and 
the German Democratic Republic share an understanding that the danger of war 
must never again emanate from German soil." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's visit dramatized the profound changes that East-West relations are 
undergoing, in particular those between West Germany and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Of those relations, West German government spokesman Hans Klein said that 
Gorbachev's intensive talks with Kohl led to "significant increase in mutual 
trust and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
And the spokesman said there was no attempt by Gorbachev, despite Western 
fears, to drive a wedge between West Germany and its North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization allies on the issues of nuclear arms reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Klein added that West Germany is "very grateful" that Gorbachev emphasized that 
the "common European home" should "have room and space for our friends in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
He also declared that the huge and warm welcome extended the Soviet leader by 
the West German people reflected "the hope he had given West Germans about the 
future of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
"The existence of the Federal Republic of Germany is closely linked to what 
happened in the Soviet Union after the war and its expansionist tendencies," 
Klein added, recalling the formation of the Federal Republic 40 years ago as a 
key Western ally in containing Stalinist communism. "So when a man who supports 
and is in the vanguard of the policy of openness comes, Germans, who are the 
main group affected by the division of Europe, have hope." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also addressed this critical topic when, referring to his 
enthusiastic welcome, he said: "Everywhere, people want changes for the better. 
Everywhere, people are tired of war. Everywhere in the world people want our 
global problems resolved. We are trying to do that and that is why people 
receive us so warmly." 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviet president said of the changing East-West climate, "I think we 
have moved out of the period of the Cold War and gone beyond it. But sometimes 
there are still frosts and cold drafts." 
</P>
<P>
As for the recent NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Gorbachev said the arms 
reductions proposals put forward by President Bush and the accompanying 
Brussels Declaration represent an important step forward. 
</P>
<P>
But, Gorbachev added, "it contains a lot of elements of the old philosophy, 
that of the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there is new packaging, there is new rhetoric," he said, "but the 
thrust is still deterrence, nuclear deterrence. I must say we were unable to 
regard the Brussels Declaration as a breakthrough. We are for a reduction and 
then the complete elimination of nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
"I have to note that with some sadness," he said, his voice deepening. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, the West German spokesman, said that Kohl would call President Bush, 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois 
Mitterrand to report on the results of his talks with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President Bush to 
Brunswick, Ga., later confirmed that Bush had received a telephone call from 
Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher will fly to Washington next week to 
brief the Bush Administration more fully on the visit, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl spent an unscheduled 4 1/2 hours with Gorbachev late Wednesday evening, 
believed to be one of the longest single talks that Gorbachev has had with 
another world leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I attach great importance to the good personal relationship that has developed 
between me and Chancellor Kohl," Gorbachev said in his press conference. "This 
makes it possible to discuss openly and effectively all sorts of questions 
which might otherwise be hard." 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a steel plant in Dortmund in the industrial Ruhr Valley, Gorbachev 
received another noisy welcome by hard-hatted workers. He was cheered after 
almost every sentence when he told about 7,000 workers at Hoesch Steel that 
during his trip: "We have seen many faces, looked into many eyes, and we sensed 
an enormous empathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would describe it as a movement of souls, the desire of our peoples to come 
together." 
</P>
<P>
In the cavernous strip-mill building, he told the workers: "We do not claim a 
monopoly on truth. Our policies are an invitation to all governments and 
peoples to search for ways to a better world." 
</P>
<P>
Trade union leader Werner Nass, who had invited Gorbachev to come to the Hoesch 
works, said the Soviet leader should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize 
this year.

Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told Communist Party activists in Uzbekistan 
on Thursday that corruption, political intrigue and ethnic hatred led to 
violence against the Meskhetians, a Turkish minority. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov completed a four-day investigation of the rioting with a party meeting 
in the republic's capital of Tashkent, the official news agency Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the work of ruthless and cruel hands of those to whom inter-ethnic 
enmity has always been the soil for the criminal mentality that everything 
goes," Tass quoted him as telling party officials. "Corruption and shady 
economic and political dealings" played a role, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov said the violence was well-planned and aimed at destabilizing the 
republic and the country. He did not identify any group or people he held 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
At another party meeting Wednesday near Fergana, the city hit hardest by the 
unrest, Ryzhkov said party and government officials gave gasoline, 
transportation and vodka to attackers who killed the Turks. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, the party daily, said prosecutors have arrested several hundred people 
on charges of organizing pogroms and violent actions and that proceedings have 
begun in more than 60 cases. Up to 100 people were killed and hundreds were 
injured in the attacks.

<P>
For the first time since the surge in opening of diplomatic relations between 
China and non-Communist countries in the 1970s, Beijing is being buffeted by 
human rights criticism from which it had largely been immune. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only the United States that has made the basic rights of Chinese 
citizens a key factor in bilateral diplomatic relations. From Canada to 
Australia, throughout Western Europe and into Southeast Asia, governments have 
suddenly -- some say belatedly -- taken stands that they once seemed to reserve 
for the Soviet Union and other nations with a record of persecuting political 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is perhaps tragic that it took oppression of this magnitude to bring on an 
outcry," said a Western diplomat here, referring to the bloody suppression of 
anti-government protesters June 3-4. "But now at least, governments have to 
take human rights into account.' 
</P>
<P>
China rejects the criticism as interference in its internal affairs and 
maintains that it is only the work of a "small number" of countries. The United 
States has been singled out because it is sheltering dissident leader Fang 
Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, in the U.S. Embassy here. 
</P>
<P>
Even several Communist-led countries from which little or no outcry might been 
expected have spoken up. On Thursday, the last day of his visit to West 
Germany, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said, "I think all of us are 
very much concerned at what is happening in China." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which has been at odds with China for many years but which has been 
seeking better relations, issued a statement denying reports that it supported 
the crackdown. It called the bloodshed "regrettable," although earlier Hanoi 
Radio, in an echo of the official Chinese version, had labeled the violence the 
work of "ruffians." 
</P>
<P>
Among the surprise critics was Mexico, which often steers clear of even 
symbolic expressions on such messy foreign issues. The government there 
expressed disapproval by canceling a visit by Foreign Minister Fernando Solana 
to China that was scheduled later for this year. A reciprocal visit by Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Mexico was also suspended, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, even President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua issued a mildly worded 
reproof, saying his country "cannot applaud the violence in Asian countries 
such as China or against the Palestinian or South African people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visa Extensions Offered 
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Australian and Canadian governments, besides expressing disapproval, 
have all said they will grant the Chinese students in their countries extended 
visas if they fear returning home. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign students around the world have protested the army assault 
on the demonstrators in and around Tian An Men Square. In a sense, the youthful 
demonstrations are an indication of a 30-year turn in the foreign view of 
China's government. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, China was the darling of activist students in far-flung lands. 
When Mao Tse-tung called out the youthful Red Guards to overturn the party 
bureaucracy during the Cultural Revolution, thousands of students around the 
world mimicked the hordes, often wearing the floppy caps of the People's 
Liberation Army and waving the Little Red Books of Mao quotations. 
</P>
<P>
Now there have been reports of student demonstrations from such disparate 
countries as Britain, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines and Indonesia, which has 
been considering a renewal of ties with China after a 22-year-break. 
</P>
<P>
Some governments of nearby countries have been restrained in their criticism 
for fear of severely damaging relations with China. The end of China's support 
for guerrilla wars in the region is credited with keeping most of Southeast 
Asia in relative peace since the end of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
China is considered a key participant in peace talks aimed at ending the 
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; China's consent is considered necessary if 
the brutal Khmer Rouge is to be kept out of a future government there. Thailand 
expressed concern that with a power struggle under way in Beijing, China might 
not continue to pay attention to the search for a solution in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, after some mild expressions of concern about the violence, has stopped 
short of commenting on China's current manhunt of student leaders and other 
protesters. A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Japan said this week that "the 
crackdown is an internal affair." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tazio Watanabe said: "It is our hope that the 
Chinese government will be fully cognizant of the international implications of 
the developments . . . and of its own status in international society." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Only to U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is China's second-leading trading partner, after Hong Kong. It is second 
only to the United States in terms of money invested in China. 
</P>
<P>
The economic fallout of the diplomatic flare-up is hard to measure. A Chinese 
trade delegation returned ahead of schedule from Europe last week when the 
European Community canceled meetings with it in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency, reporting Thursday that "disturbances over 
the past two months caused direct economic losses of more than $270 million to 
the Chinese capital," said that "statistics from the foreign trade departments 
show an export reduction of more than $26 million, while some business 
negotiations were canceled and contracts withdrawn." It added that the Beijing 
Tourist Administration reported a loss of $14 million from canceled tourist 
reservations in May and early June. 
</P>
<P>
Some private Japanese loans are on hold, and the Japanese government suspended 
its huge economic assistance program after the shootings, although it stressed 
that the move was a practical matter, not a sanction. Japan's economic 
assistance amounts to 56% of all foreign aid to China. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has tried to separate its hard-line policies over the 
crackdown from its economic relations. State television has broadcast several 
pictures of foreign businessmen banqueting and visiting factories as an 
indication that all is safe and normal. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the United States had rarely criticized China's human rights 
practices as harshly as it did those in countries with political systems 
similar to China's. In its latest human rights report, issued in February, the 
State Department said that "periodic setbacks in the human rights situation 
serve to highlight the limits on the rate and scope of liberalization" in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Subtle' Retribution 
</P>
<P>
It cited "violent suppression" of anti-Chinese demonstrations in Tibet as one 
of the setbacks as well as the "subtle" retribution meted out to dissidents, 
including the refusal of permission to travel abroad and obstruction of career 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
The report mentioned, however, that there appears to be a liberalizing trend 
and concluded that "there is reason to believe that this liberalizing trend 
will continue . . . in fits and starts in the coming years."

ENVOYS DID 'DAMNEDEST' FOR AMERICANS, STATE DEPT. SAYS

The State Department, responding to complaints that it was slow to react to the 
violence in China, said Thursday that U.S. Embassy staff members in Beijing did 
"their damnedest" to evacuate Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is certainly there that the U.S. Embassy in China did not 
anticipate and, therefore, was not prepared to deal adequately with this crisis 
in China. We should have known!" California Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), 
chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, said at a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
He said many American students told of difficulty in leaving China and had not 
gotten much help from the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Williams, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian 
and Pacific Affairs, said Ambassador James R. Lilley and the embassy staff 
worked around the clock to help Americans in China after the violence in Tian 
An Men Square early on June 4 when Chinese troops fired on demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 6,000 Americans left China safely over the past week, one of the 
largest evacuations of Americans in a crisis situation since World War II," 
Williams said in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"No American died in the crisis in China, and only two U.S. citizens were 
injured. Maybe it wasn't perfect. But they (the embassy staff) gave it their 
damnedest." 
</P>
<P>
When Americans were advised to leave China, Williams said, embassy officials 
contacted as many of them as possible and organized convoys to the Beijing 
airport for more than 200 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that about 1,000 Americans remain in China, including 182 U.S. 
government employees. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Administration official said the turmoil in China does not 
necessarily mean the country has turned its back on economic and political 
reforms, the Associated Press reported. The official, who requested anonymity, 
suggested that the United States still can do business with supreme leader Deng 
Xiaoping despite the military crackdown and the massacre of hundreds -- perhaps 
thousands -- of people.

7 AT INS CENTER NAMED IN DRUG INDICTMENTS

A six-month undercover investigation has led to federal drug indictments 
against nine people, including seven who worked at an Immigration and 
Naturalization Service center, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments, issued in McAllen, were ordered unsealed Thursday after seven 
arrests were made, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Crews said. An eighth person was 
arrested later Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of those indicted had worked either for the INS or a private security 
firm at the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, where illegal aliens are 
detained before deportation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments allege that cocaine and marijuana were sold to someone working 
in cooperation with investigators, Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts of drugs are relatively small," he said. "What makes it 
exceptionally significant, to us, however, is that the offenses are alleged to 
have occurred either at the service processing center or by individuals 
employed by the United States."

WON'T ABANDON CAUSES, DEPARTING KOOP VOWS

Departing Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, reflecting on his eight years as the 
nation's top doctor, promised Thursday that after leaving government he will 
not abandon any of the causes he has actively and publicly promoted. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like someone to say five years from now that when Koop left the office 
of surgeon general he continued to be the health conscience of the country," he 
said, speaking in his final meeting with reporters as surgeon general. "I will 
continue to deliver health messages to this country as long as people will 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
Koop, who will leave his post July 13 to write his memoirs, said that his 
greatest satisfactions have come from the public response to his anti-smoking 
campaign, in which he called for a smoke-free society by the year 2000, and to 
his 1986 AIDS report, which, he said, "is just as accurate today as it was 
then." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His 'Top Success' 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of Americans who smoke dropped to 26% from 34% during his 
tenure, he said, and his anti-smoking messages have inspired many changes in 
state and local laws regarding smoking in public places. He said that "in the 
matter of numbers," it was his "top success." 
</P>
<P>
But it was his report to the public on AIDS -- in which he called for AIDS 
education in elementary school and urged the use of condoms to reduce 
transmission of the virus -- that forced a national public debate on issues 
that many Americans had been unwilling to confront, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I faced the issue squarely and used the language that I did -- and I 
don't know what you can call a penis, a vagina and a condom other than what 
they are -- that finally pushed people reluctantly and slowly into a position 
of reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that "certain very conservative" members of the Ronald Reagan White 
House staff, whom he did not identify, "would have done almost anything to shut 
me up." In fact, he said, only one week after the release of the AIDS report, 
they urged him to "update" it by eliminating the references to condoms. He 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
"They left my office in a huff," he said. "They're gone -- and I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given Free Hand 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "Never since I have been in this job has anyone at a high 
level criticized me, or suggested that I not say something, or say something 
that I didn't believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Koop raised the ire of many conservatives with his AIDS document, and also by 
his refusal to write a report describing the physical and psychological 
ramifications of abortion, a study he said could not be supported by scientific 
data. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was this same constituency that had avidly backed him during the 
10 months it took for his confirmation to be approved. Congressional liberals, 
led by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), had stalled the nomination because 
they considered Koop a right-wing religious zealot with little experience in 
public health. Since then, Waxman and others have become ardent admirers of 
Koop. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to me is a lesson about labels," Koop said. "I have always been 
conservative, but never the arch-conservative that the right-wing politicos 
thought I was. When I arrived, I never promised to espouse any causes. All I 
have done in this job is to face issues and deal with them as honestly as I 
could under the umbrella of public health." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Education as Key 
</P>
<P>
An avowed opponent of abortion, Koop said that he believes the only way to 
eliminate abortion is not to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court Roe vs. Wade 
decision, but to "educate people in a way we've never done" in matters of 
sexuality and contraception. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a social issue which divides the people of this country like nothing 
else since the days of slavery," he said. "Both sides have become more 
entrenched, and I don't see any flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, preventive medicine in the form of increased education is the 
only solution. "If you want to get rid of abortions, you'd better get rid of 
the reasons for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koop, a former pediatric surgeon, said he had hoped to be named secretary of 
health and human services in the Bush Administration. "I would have liked to be 
secretary, and I think I would have done a very credible job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koop said he would not have remained as surgeon general, even if the Bush 
Administration had asked him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 73," he said. " . . . I don't know how much time I have left ahead . . . I 
would like to take a crack at the private sector and try, if I can, to make 
some kind of impact on health from that perspective."

CRANSTON CHARGES BUSH NOMINEE KNEW OF CONTRA AID 
</P>

In a belated echo of the Iran-Contra affair, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
charged Thursday that the Bush Administration is "stonewalling" Congress about 
the role played by aides to then-Vice President George Bush in providing secret 
aid to Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston used a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing to press an effort 
to block confirmation of Bush's nominee as ambassador to South Korea, Donald P. 
Gregg, but he said that the panel's investigation of Gregg has been hampered by 
the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Important Questions' 
</P>
<P>
"Many important questions may never be answered satisfactorily, especially 
because we've been stonewalled by the Administration," he said. "The National 
Security Agency has rejected our legitimate inquiries out of hand. . . . The 
State Department's response was utterly non-responsive." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston also released new evidence that he said suggested that Gregg, who was 
Bush's national security adviser during the Ronald Reagan Administration, knew 
more about secret aid to the Nicaraguan Contras than he has acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
But Gregg rejected Cranston's charges as "a conspiracy theory," and Republican 
members of the committee said they believed the Administration had cooperated 
adequately with the inquest. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators said that in the absence of a "smoking gun," Gregg is likely 
to win confirmation as ambassador to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll do fine," Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has charged that Gregg, a former CIA officer, was involved in the 
secret efforts of White House aide Oliver L. North to provide aid to the 
Contras during the period when Congress had prohibited U.S. funding for the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
He has accused Gregg of "misleading" the committee by denying that he knew 
anything about North's covert operations in Central America during 1985 and 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Gregg stuck to his account that, despite several meetings with North and 
others involved in the operation, he did not realize what was going on until it 
was exposed in news accounts at the end of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that I was hiding anything," he said. "I just didn't put it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
When he finally did learn what had been going on, Gregg added: "I was furious 
at North, I felt very let down by (his associate) Felix (Rodriguez) and I 
faulted myself for not putting the pieces together." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston released a memorandum written by a North aide which indicated that 
Rodriguez was working with North to help the Contras as early as January, 1985. 
Gregg had contended that Rodriguez did not work on the Contra effort until 
September, 1985, but confronted with the memorandum, conceded that Rodriguez 
might have misled him. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and other Democratic senators also called on the White House to seek 
the release of North's notebooks, which include detailed records of the aide's 
dealing with Gregg and others. Congress has been given only heavily censored 
copies of the notebooks, in which huge portions have been blacked out by North 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like Doonesbury, only worse," said Cranston, displaying an 
ink-blotched page of the notebooks. By "Doonesbury," he was apparently 
referring to the comic strip, whose panels this week have included, in a 
self-parody, massive ink blots. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said: "I'm willing to vote for Mr. Gregg if we will 
get the notebooks. . . . Let's get the documents." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) noted that the committee has already 
subpoenaed North to turn over the notebooks and North has refused. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to go further than a subpoena," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to vote on Gregg's nomination on Tuesday. Cranston 
said he would not predict the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some senators who are uncertain," he said.

SLEEPING CYCLES RESET BY DOSES OF BRIGHT LIGHT

<P>
Carefully timed doses of bright light promise to be an effective tool in 
resetting the internal clocks of people troubled by jet lag and similar sleep 
disturbances, scientists reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A team of Boston researchers said tests of 14 men found that humans' natural 
alarm clocks are far more sensitive to light than expected, and "can be reset 
to any desired phase by scheduled exposure to light for two to three days." 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, it can take nine days or longer for the body to adjust to a new 
sleep-wake cycle after long international flights or working a swing shift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Lead to Cures 
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the journal Science, the scientists speculated that 
their technique may pave the way for "rapid and practical" treatments for 
people plagued by sleep disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The research, directed by Dr. Charles Czeisler, expands on his 1986 study that 
showed light has a direct biological effect on sleep-wake patterns, rather than 
just indirectly throwing the cycle off by making it difficult to fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
The body's internal clock, or "circadian pacemaker," is located in the 
hypothalamus -- the brain's regulatory center for sleep and other vital 
activities. Nerves from the eye's retina are linked to the hypothalamus, and 
Czeisler theorizes that most resetting action comes from light's impact on that 
system.

"We thought the rain would keep everyone away, but look who's here," said art 
gallery manager Charmain Guzman as customers streamed into the three-tiered, 
12-acre complex of restaurants and stores that is built partly under the city's 
downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Andrew Young was heckled by advocates for the homeless when he took the 
stage to officially open the project. But the protesters, who handed out 
leaflets questioning the city's spending priorities, were booed into silence by 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aimed at Suburbanites 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta hopes the complex, which was funded by the city through development 
bonds and private investment, will not only bring suburban residents back to 
downtown after dark but also be an incentive to tourists and convention-goers. 
</P>
<P>
The original Underground Atlanta opened under the city's viaducts in 1969 but 
was closed in 1982 because of the perception that it was riddled with crime. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the new complex, which contains 100 retail shops and 22 restaurants 
and nightclubs, will be the site of a Coca-Cola museum honoring the city's 
best-known product, a museum on Atlanta history and an antique railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had planned to release 3,000 balloons during Thursday's opening 
ceremonies, which were to feature marching bands and dance troupes. But 
downpours forced festivities indoors, where children were handed balloons and 
bands marched in place instead.

<P>
The Yugoslav Parliament on Thursday passed a law banning future construction of 
nuclear power plants or facilities for processing nuclear wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency said the ban also applied to any planning for new plants. 
The Parliament rejected a government proposal to ban new nuclear plants only 
until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has only one nuclear power plant, at Krsko in the northwest republic 
of Slovenia. Plans to build four more by the year 2000 were shelved under 
public pressure after the Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The plant at Krsko, built by Westinghouse Corp., has suffered frequent 
breakdowns that have prompted questions in the press about the technology.

YOUNGSTERS IN DRUG TRADE EASILY GET GUNS, PANEL TOLD

Eighteen-year-old Detra J. of the District of Columbia, saying "everyone knows 
how to get a gun if they want one," told a House panel Thursday that she knows 
children as young as 12 who arm themselves because they are involved in drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"If they hustle for a person -- he's a runner or a hit man -- he's getting a 
gun to carry out the orders the man has given him," Detra, whose last name was 
not revealed, told the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people she knows have been shot to death, she said, adding: "Half had 
guns and were in a gunfight, and half of them were innocent bystanders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Financial Rewards 
</P>
<P>
But the deaths do not keep others from getting involved in the drug trade, she 
said. "Most of them, after their friends die, they get deeper into it," because 
of the financial rewards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They get involved because they want fast money, to buy cars, jewelry and 
radios. They don't get (legitimate) jobs because the pay is too low," said 
Detra, who works in a local Recreation Department program. 
</P>
<P>
She said many ideas floated by lawmakers to keep young people from obtaining 
guns will not work, including making it more difficult to buy weapons legally. 
The District of Columbia has one of the toughest gun control laws in the 
country, yet young people have no trouble getting them illegally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Holding parents liable for their children's use of weapons will fail because, 
she said, "there's not too many youth today who talk to their parents. . . . 
It's not a family bond anymore" and parents do not have control over their 
drug-dealing children. 
</P>
<P>
Two experts who testified differed on the seriousness of gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatrician Katherine K. Christoffel of Chicago, representing the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, said that "10 American children ages 18 and under are 
killed every day in handgun suicides, homicides and accidents. . . . In 1987, 
gun injuries were the fourth-leading cause of unintentional-injury death for 
children ages 14 and under." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kleck, an associate professor of criminology at Florida State University 
in Tallahassee, said that accidental shootings of innocent bystanders "are 
extremely rare," involvement of guns in youth suicide has been decreasing since 
1979, except for a slight upturn in 1984 and 1985, and fatal gun accidents have 
been declining for 20 years.

FDA APPROVES SALES OF AIDS PNEUMONIA DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved prescription sales 
of aerosol pentamidine, a medication to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 
the most common life-threatening infection seen in AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
The medication is already widely used by AIDS patients under a expanded 
distribution scheme announced by the FDA in February, and final marketing 
approval had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal action ensures that almost all health insurers will now cover 
the expensive monthly treatments. Previously, many insurers, including the 
federal Medicare program, had refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, hailed the 
approval as a key step that may help "an estimated 100,000 or more individuals" 
who are at risk of developing the pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"It should improve the quality of life for those at highest risk from this 
infection," he said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
News of the FDA action was greeted with elation at San Francisco General 
Hospital, where much of the key data leading to aerosol pentamidine's approval 
was compiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Super," said Dr. Paul A. Volberding, director of the hospital's division of 
AIDS activities. 
</P>
<P>
Volberding said the announcement "shows that advances are being made" against 
AIDS and that the FDA "is listening to the pressure of the epidemic and the 
calls from the (patient) community for a more rapid response." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fred R. Sattler, coordinator of the interdisciplinary AIDS Clinic at 
County-USC Medical Center in Los Angeles, said aerosol pentamidine "was the 
best studied form of pneumocystis prophylaxis that we have right now." 
</P>
<P>
Sattler said effective use of aerosol pentamidine and other medications, such 
as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, may "reduce the incidence of pneumocystis 
five- to 10-fold." But he cautioned that aerosol pentamidine was "far from 
perfect" and would need to be improved upon. 
</P>
<P>
The medications work by preventing the pneumocystis germ from multiplying in 
the lungs and creating a serious infection. 
</P>
<P>
Aerosol pentamidine is manufactured by LyphoMed Inc. of Rosemont, Ill. 
According to the FDA, the drug is recommended for AIDS patients who have had at 
least one episode of pneumocystis pneumonia, as well as individuals who have 
never had pneumocystis but are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus 
and have T-4 lymphocyte counts of 200 per cubic millimeter or less. 
</P>
<P>
The drug is inhaled into the lungs as an aerosol spray. The FDA said it should 
be administered once every four weeks, using an inexpensive inhalation device 
known as the Respirgard II nebulizer, which is manufactured by Marquest Corp. 
of Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of aerosol pentamidine to pharmacies is $99.45 per 300 milligram dose, 
but the drug's manufacturer estimates that one year of treatment might cost 
patients more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primary Goal 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control published 
recommendations for greatly expanded voluntary AIDS antibody testing in the 
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The primary goal of this expanded 
testing is to identify individuals who may benefit from treatments to prevent 
pneumocystis. 
</P>
<P>
Aerosol pentamidine is the first new drug to be approved based on a clinical 
trial conducted largely by a group of practicing physicians. The group is the 
San Francisco Community Consortium.

JURY HEARS FINAL ARGUMENT IN CASE OF MAN ACCUSED OF BID TO RIG VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal jury preparing to deliberate the fate of a Los Angeles businessman 
charged with illegally trying to financially engineer the defeat of a U.S. 
Senate candidate heard him accused Thursday of being a man engaged in "stealth 
and deception" and defended as a respected philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Goland, long active in backing candidates who support Israel, 
recognized that his secret attempt to win reelection for Democrat Alan Cranston 
could have "disastrous consequences" for Cranston if discovered during his 
neck-and-neck race with Ed Zschau, Assistant U.S. Atty. George Newhouse said in 
his closing argument to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Goland embarked on a campaign of "stealth and deception" to conceal from voters 
that it was really a Cranston supporter who was paying $120,000 for the widely 
broadcast television commercial on behalf of American Independent Party 
candidate Edward Vallen, soliciting 55 straw donors to act as conduits for the 
money, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the public had learned what Mr. Goland was doing in California in the fall 
of '86, it would have hurt Sen. Cranston, and because Cranston was strong on 
Israel, it would have hurt Israel," Newhouse told jurors. "Mr. Goland had no 
intention of being publicly tied to this campaign to defeat Mr. Zschau." 
</P>
<P>
Goland, 41, who had engaged in a successful 1984 campaign in Illinois that 
helped defeat former Republican Sen. Charles Percy, has said he intended to 
mount a similar campaign in California under laws that make it legal for third 
parties to front independent expenditures on behalf of a political cause. 
</P>
<P>
But his lawyer, in a heated argument to the jury, declared that Goland had been 
betrayed by the aides he had hired to carry out the campaign, who he said took 
the money for the commercial and made it look as though it were an illegal 
contribution to Vallen, rather than an independent expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
The young Washington campaign consultant he hired to manage the effort, Colleen 
Morrow, turned into "the daughter of Frankenstein" and began giving Goland 
orders, defense lawyer Nathan Lewin asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin emphasized that Goland never stood to benefit from his donations on 
behalf of Cranston, who allegedly did not know about the effort and, in fact, 
dispatched his aides to talk Goland out of even a legal independent expenditure 
effort, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"What is this case? It is a criminal charge against a man for giving away his 
money the wrong way," Lewin said. "Why would a respected philanthropist who has 
been known throughout the community for supporting charities, giving away 
millions of dollars for society's good, commit criminal acts?" 
</P>
<P>
Through nearly four weeks of testimony in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
the government has attempted to portray Goland as an arrogant political 
mastermind who had emerged from a host of Federal Elections Commission 
complaints stemming from the Ohio campaign with a single $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pleas from both Cranston and the White House to avoid a similar 
campaign in California, Goland was spurred on by polls that showed Cranston and 
Zschau in a virtual dead heat as the November election approached, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Vallen emerged with 110,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The defense presented only four witnesses, and Goland did not testify. But 
Lewin said the case did not warrant a lengthier defense. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is so full of dozens, hundreds of reasonable doubts, that it's 
incredible that we're here at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse argued that Goland's claim to have thought that he was running an 
independent expenditure campaign was not believable. He said it would have been 
illegal to have used Vallen in the commercial if it were being funded as an 
independent expenditure. Moreover, Goland never filed the required reports with 
the Federal Elections Commission for an independent expenditure, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewin countered that it also makes no sense to believe that Goland was 
deliberately trying to break the law. If he were as expert on election laws as 
the government claims, Lewin said, he would never have asked his cohorts to 
collect checks from straw donors ranging from $1,000 to $4,000, when he knew 
that federal law limits legitimate individual donations to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Goland is charged with a total of five counts of conspiracy to violate federal 
election laws, causing false reports to be made to the FEC, making excessive 
contributions to a candidate and making a contribution under the name of 
another. If convicted on all counts, he faces up to 17 years in prison and a 
$1-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was to begin deliberating this morning.

'JUMP-START' FOR RECYCLING PLAN GAINS IN SENATE VOTE

The Senate, hoping to "jump-start" the state's sluggish beverage container 
recycling program, voted Thursday to more than double the redemption rate on 
beer, soft drink and other drink containers. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would increase effective 
Jan. 1 the current rate of 1 cent per recyclable container to 5 cents for two 
containers and boost to a full nickel the rate on a 24-ounce plastic container. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said aluminum cans are recycled at a rate of 57%, followed by the anemic 
showing of glass at less than 40% and plastic at only 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, starting in January, 1993, a nickel would be paid for any 
beverage can or bottle of a type that fails to reach a 65% recycling rate. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-2 vote sent the bill to the Assembly, where Hart said he "would be 
surprised if it ran into any major problems." Similar efforts to increase 
refunds for recyclable containers have failed during the nearly two years the 
program has been in operation in California. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist critics have charged that the disappointing low recycling rate 
of beverage containers in California is a result of paying a redemption rate of 
only a penny per plastic, glass or aluminum beverage can or bottle. 
</P>
<P>
They maintain that a larger sum would make it more worthwhile for Californians 
to participate. Many other states offer 5 cents per container and have 
dramatically higher recycling rates. 
</P>
<P>
Hart told the Senate that the California program "doesn't work very well 
because of the low reimbursement rates" and needs a financially rewarding 
"jump-start." 
</P>
<P>
Current law, enacted as a compromise in 1987 after years of battling between 
environmental organizations and beer and soft drink manufactures, will 
automatically boost the penny-per-container rate to 2 cents on Jan. 1 if a 65% 
recycling goal is not met and to 3 cents in 1993 if the goal still is not 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
An effort by state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to exempt 
24-ounce plastic containers from the refund increase was defeated.

Ghana has banned foreign adherents of the Mormon Church and Jehovah's Witnesses 
and given their missionaries one week to leave the nation. The government of 
Flight Lt. Jerry J. Rawlings, in a statement carried on state-run Accra Radio, 
accused the two groups of disturbing public order and threatening Ghana's 
sovereignty. Accra Radio said two small, domestic sects, Nyame Sunkwa and Jesus 
Christ of Dzorwulu, also were banned. Of Ghana's population of 13 million, 43% 
is Christian. The other major group, 32%, adheres to traditional local beliefs.

Scuba divers blew up three boats carrying badly needed food to Lebanon's 
embattled Christian heartland, and two people died in a new round of Syrian 
shelling. The supply boats were blown up in the southern port of Sidon, about 
25 miles south of Beirut, after frogmen apparently attached mines to the 
vessels, a police spokesman in Beirut said. Syrian forces have blockaded 
Christian-run ports in the Christian enclave north of Beirut. The supply 
vessels were carrying fruit, vegetables and other goods. Syrian gunners 
bombarded the Christian enclave with howitzers and rocket launchers, killing at 
least two people.

Swedish prosecutors in the case of slain Prime Minister Olof Palme suffered 
another setback when a third government witness backed off from earlier 
statements implicating defendant Christer Pettersson, 42. Prosecution witness 
Harri Sandberg-Miekkalina said police misunderstood a pretrial statement he 
made about Pettersson in which he told them Pettersson hated Palme. "It was I 
who hated Olof Palme, not Pettersson," he said, adding police induced him to 
incriminate Pettersson by suggesting he would get part of a $7.5-million 
reward. Later witnesses gave contradictory testimony regarding Pettersson's 
whereabouts on the day of Palme's slaying.

The Transportation Department is considering expanding its drug-testing program 
to include random checks for alcohol abuse among 4 million transportation 
workers, Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told Congress. Skinner also said that he 
would recommend that President Bush veto a House anti-drug bill, if passed, 
because the measure covering railroad workers would require the Administration 
to start over on a drug-testing program it has already ordered. Skinner made 
the announcement on alcohol testing before a Senate committee considering its 
version of legislation to require random testing throughout the transportation 
industries. The Transportation Department last November ordered drug testing 
programs in private transportation industries beginning at the end of this 
year, but the programs face court challenges.

A federal court jury hearing a mock trial in Cincinnati said it would award 
neighbors of a Department of Energy plant $136 million in damages from the 
former operator of the facility, which processes uranium used in producing 
nuclear weapons. The jury, in a non-binding verdict intended to encourage a 
settlement, ruled that National Lead of Ohio Inc. operated the Feed Materials 
Production Center at Fernald in a way that lowered property values and caused 
emotional distress to neighbors. The company, which operated the plant under 
contract for the government from 1951 through 1985, and its parent company, 
National Lead Industries Inc., are defendants in a class-action lawsuit on 
behalf of 14,000 people. The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of 
radioactive dust have been released from faulty filters since the plant opened.

For the second time in less than two weeks, thieves broke into a locked cage 
and stole a rare bird from the San Diego Zoo. The stolen 30-year-old male 
African bateleur eagle had lived at the zoo since 1961. On June 3, a female 
African milky eagle owl was stolen from a cage about 100 yards away. Zoo 
officials said the thefts apparently were well planned by someone with specific 
knowledge about the birds. There was no evidence the thefts were committed by 
the same people.

An association of Chinese students and scholars at Stanford University urged 
the Chinese government to guarantee the safety and free trial of those arrested 
in recent pro-democracy demonstrations. "We are very much concerned about the 
safety and freedom of innocent people who have done nothing wrong but only 
organized peaceful demonstrations or spoken against the Chinese government 
based on truth and out of their own conscience," said an open letter from the 
association. The letter said, "It is apparent that some of the arrested have 
been sentenced to death." Three activists were given the death penalty by 
Chinese officials for setting a train on fire in Shanghai.

Over objections of the Bush Administration, the House Ways and Means human 
resources subcommittee voted to raise the tax that finances federal 
unemployment insurance. The proposed tax increase, which would be paid by 
employers, is the first voted this year by any House or Senate subcommittee. 
When fully effective in 1992, the proposed increase would cost employers $4 for 
each employee per year, a total of $10.6 billion over the next five years. The 
tax increase is part of a broad package of changes in federal unemployment and 
welfare programs, including a $1.77-billion child-care initiative over the next 
five years.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INITIATIVE WOULD LET DOGS RUN UNLEASHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dogs will be able to run without leashes on Hermosa Beach's greenbelt if a 
petition submitted last week qualifies for the November ballot and is approved 
by the voters. The petition, circulated by a group of pet owners called 
Watchdog, carried 2,108 signatures, about 800 more than needed to qualify as an 
initiative. The city must verify the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would exempt dogs from the city's leash law as long as they 
remained under the "confident control" of their handlers on the Santa Fe 
Railroad right of way, a strip of land running through Hermosa Beach between 
Valley Drive and Ardmore Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would eliminate the city's right under current open space 
zoning to use 10% of the open space for development. Some City Council members 
have proposed construction of gazebos, shelters, public toilets and visitor 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted in February to apply the leash law to the strip after its 
purchase of the land is finalized Jan. 1, 1990. That decision aroused pet 
owners who have exercised their unleashed dogs for years on the right of way 
without interference from the railroad company.

CONFEREES DISCUSS 'KILLER' BEE QUARANTINE SITES AND EMERGENCY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture officials from California, Texas and Arizona discussed plans 
Thursday to quarantine sites of initial swarms of Africanized honey bees and 
prepare emergency services in cases of massive stinging attacks if or when the 
bees arrive to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Task forces to handle the anticipated northward migration of Africanized bees 
into the United States -- as early as next spring, some say -- are determining 
how each state's agencies and departments should react. 
</P>
<P>
Conferees at a symposium that ended Thursday in Mission Valley continued to 
debate what impact the so-called "killer" bees might have in the more temperate 
climates found in the United States. Africanized bees prefer tropical to 
subtropical climes. 
</P>
<P>
California has already been given the go-ahead by Gov. George Deukmejian to 
appoint a task force to study the impact of the bees headed by the Department 
of Food and Agriculture, said Len Foote, control and eradication chief of the 
Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeopardizing Honey Industry 
</P>
<P>
The migration of the bees into California would jeopardize the $18-million 
annual business of the honey industry, as well as result in loss of livestock 
and small animals caused by mass stinging by the bees if precautionary steps 
are not taken, conferees said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the infrastructure for the task forces, though, is already in place. 
</P>
<P>
"California is prepared to deal with Africanized honey bees which arrive in 
advance of the migratory front," Foote said. Baited hive traps have been set at 
ports along California's coast to trap any swarms that might come over by ship, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A joint San Diego and Imperial counties task force should be in place by 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Approval for a Texas Africanized Honey Bee Management Plan is expected soon, 
said John Thomas, an entomologist with the Texas Agricultural Extension 
Service. The Texas plan, which the other states have followed in slightly 
modified versions, stresses rapid detection and eradication of the isolated 
Africanized colonies that are likely to precede the bees' main migratory 
population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Establishing Quarantine Zone 
</P>
<P>
Once an Africanized colony has been identified, a 150-mile quarantine zone 
around the area will be established, Thomas said. Conferees could not agree on 
what methods would be most effective in handling the pest, if or when it 
becomes well-established. 
</P>
<P>
Two contingency plans in combatting the insect have emerged. One idea is to 
destroy all feral, or non-commercial, bee colonies. Proponents of destroying 
these "wild" bee colonies say it is necessary because the colonies' domestic 
European bees are easily overtaken by the Africanized strain. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts say that destroying all wild beehives is unrealistic. 
Authorities are bound to miss some. 
</P>
<P>
Bees "can nest just about anywhere," said Ivan Shields, director of the Arizona 
Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture. "If that's happening now, it's 
certainly going to happen with the Africanized variety, probably even more so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mating Queens With Drones 
</P>
<P>
Another idea is to continuously repopulate colonies with the European variety 
of queens. The Texas plan requests funding for research into mating the 
European queens with European drones under controlled conditions, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Under natural conditions, honey bees always mate in flight. The Africanized 
drones, faster than their European counterparts, are generally more successful 
in mating with a European queen. Previous, unsuccessful attempts at controlled 
mating were conducted in cages or closed rooms with little or no regard to 
flight behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are looking into designing a wind tunnel to simulate natural 
conditions for free-flying mating. If successful, such a wind tunnel could be 
used for large-scale production of "pure" European honey bee queens. What is 
not certain is how effective this method might be in combatting feral 
Africanized colonies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more intriguing problems posed by the bee is liability in the event 
of a stinging death. Under current laws, commercial bees -- those handled by 
beekeepers for apiary products -- are classified as domestic animals, according 
to Ivar Leetma, a San Diego attorney specializing in environmental issues. 
Those laws may change with the advent of Africanized bees, Leetma said. 
Governmental agencies could be held liable if signs warning of the danger of 
the bees are not placed in public parks or other open areas where a stinging 
death might occur, he said.

MAYOR URGES USING POTENTIAL ARTS FESTIVAL PROFITS FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linking two of her pet projects in an optimistic economic scenario, San Diego 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Thursday recommended that a potential $1-million 
profit from this fall's Soviet arts festival be used to avoid cutbacks in 
after-school recreation and other youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-page memo to her City Council colleagues, O'Connor urged that proceeds 
from the three-week arts festival in San Diego be earmarked for city-funded 
children's programs tentatively scheduled for budget cuts in the fiscal year to 
begin July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor's desire to preserve various youth programs drew a favorable 
response Thursday from several council members, some of them questioned the 
wisdom of depending on still-speculative profits from the arts festival to 
underwrite those key services. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my first reaction was, 'What profits?' " City Councilwoman Judy 
McCarty said. "I'd like to have the money in hand before we start making 
promises. And to this point, the thinking has been that we might be lucky to 
not lose money, much less make $1 million on the festival." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reservations Cited 
</P>
<P>
However, mayoral staffers and festival officials, pointing to encouraging 
ticket reservations and projected merchandising revenue, described the $1 
million profit figure as a realistic -- perhaps even conservative -- estimate 
for the Oct. 21-Nov. 11 event. The $6-million cultural affairs festival will 
feature folk art, theater, films, religious icons and more than two dozen of 
the famous bejeweled Faberge Imperial eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can resolve the children's program funding crisis by wedding the 
virtues of art and children to increased tourism and profit (resulting from the 
festival)," O'Connor wrote in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Long a staunch advocate of youth programs, the former schoolteacher argued 
that, the city's severe budget constraints notwithstanding, cutbacks in those 
programs would be particularly ill-advised this year, which she declared the 
"Year of the Child" in January's State of the City address. Although O'Connor 
did not mention it in Thursday's memo, such cutbacks also could be politically 
embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 'Year of the Child' we cannot possibly abandon our commitment to the 
after-school recreation program, the summer water safety and portable pool 
program, the bookmobile and other efforts that serve the developmental needs of 
tens of thousands of our children," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$577,000 Cut Proposed 
</P>
<P>
In the proposed $931-million fiscal 1990 budget that he unveiled last month, 
City Manager John Lockwood recommended a $577,000 reduction in after-school 
recreation programs that would eliminate half of the 74 sites and a $205,000 
cut to be achieved by closing eight city-run pools for nine weeks in the fall 
and spring. Under Lockwood's proposal, library hours also would be curtailed in 
several neighborhoods and a city bookmobile would be taken off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
To find additional money to meet the council's overriding goal of expanding the 
city's police force, Lockwood is expected to outline in another budget memo 
today deeper cuts in youth-oriented programs. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, however, argued vigorously that budget-cutters should look elsewhere 
in their search for scarce dollars to bolster police manpower levels. Those 
"pressing police needs" could be addressed, O'Connor said in the memo, through 
cuts in other unspecified areas, early paybacks on downtown redevelopment 
debts, and state and federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in the youth programs could even have the ironically unfortunate 
consequence of increasing crime problems, O'Connor said, noting that the 
programs "provide children with alternatives to the dead end of gang 
membership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorsed Objective 
</P>
<P>
Council members interviewed Thursday strongly endorsed O'Connor's objective of 
protecting the youth programs from severe budget cuts. However, while sharing 
the mayor's goal, they questioned her proposed method of accomplishing it -- in 
the process, showing that that they remain skeptical about O'Connor's rosy 
forecast for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"Those kids' programs would be one of the things at the top of my list to 
continue," Councilman Ron Roberts said. "My major concern is that there's no 
guarantee this profit from the festival is going to materialize. I'd rather 
find a guaranteed source of funding to keep these programs alive." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty added: "If there are $1 million in profits, we'll be absolutely 
thrilled, and many programs will be standing in line to spend that money. But 
that still seems optimistic to me. I don't want to take the chance. What 
happens if there are no profits?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident of Profit 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's aides and festival executives, however, insist that they are 
increasingly confident that the festival -- financed in part with $3 million in 
public funds allocated by the council -- will finish in the black. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Herring, the festival's executive director, said Thursday that the 
projected $1-million profit is based on revenue from advance ticket sales, 
lower-than-expected costs for expenses such as air fare for the Soviet artists, 
and a percentage of funds from T-shirts and other merchandise to be sold during 
the festival by merchants licensed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also anticipate that additional revenue will be realized through 
private evening showings of the Faberge eggs, icons and folk art to be marketed 
to corporations, Herring said. Moreover, festival directors forecast that the 
city will benefit through more than $35 million in so-called "indirect revenue" 
spent by festival visitors for hotels, meals and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"Every early sign indicates that (the festival) will be a resounding success," 
O'Connor said in the memo. "How appropriate, then, that the revenue originally 
generated by a tourist tax will bring San Diego priceless art exhibits and even 
more tourism, and then eventually produce proceeds to underwrite our children's 
needs . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Uneasy 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that O'Connor has monitored the festival's planning more 
closely than they have, council members said they remain to be convinced that 
the mayor's optimism about its economic outlook is merited. Customary budgetary 
caution and their ardent support for the youth programs, they explained, 
combine to leave them somewhat uneasy about relying too heavily on the 
festival's projected profit. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor sounds pretty confident that that $1 million is going to be there," 
Roberts said. "If it turns out that's the only money available for the 
children's programs, fine. But I guess I'd just feel more comfortable using 
funds we're certain about. Any revenue or profit from the festival is going to 
be speculative for at least another six months. I don't want to leave these 
kids' programs hanging on the line."

ESCONDIDO COUNCIL CHOOSES OFFICIAL FROM MARIN COUNTY TO BE THE NEW CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Escondido City Council has hired the 42-year-old city manager of a small 
Marin County community to replace Vern Hazen, the city's former chief 
administrator who resigned in January under pressure from council members. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Clark, city manager of Larkspur, a town of 12,000, was the unanimous 
choice of the five council members, who often do not see eye to eye. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Doris Thurston made the announcement of Clark's hiring at Wednesday 
night's council meeting and Thursday commented that the new manager was "a very 
creative and personable" man. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was chosen over six other finalists, a group that included three 
Escondido city staff members. He is expected to assume the post July 17, 
replacing acting city manager Ray Blair. Blair, former San Diego city manager, 
did not apply for the Escondido post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100,000 Annual Salary 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido position carries a salary of $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Long Beach, Clark worked for 14 years for the city of Costa Mesa in 
Orange County, rising from assistant planner to development services director 
for the city of about 90,000. In l986, he became Larkspur city manager and 
finance director. 
</P>
<P>
Thurston said Orange County officials who worked with Clark during his years at 
Costa Mesa described him as an "outstanding person and administrator." 
</P>
<P>
Each finalist was interviewed for two hours by the council, Thurston said, and 
Clark emerged as the unanimous choice. The mayor cited Clark's financial 
experience as a factor in his selection over other qualified candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis said Clark's "tremendous broad base of 
experience" in government tipped the scales in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Team Leader and a Team Player 
</P>
<P>
"He is a high-energy type of guy who will fit in well with the highly qualified 
city staff we already have here," DeDominicis said. "He will be a good team 
leader as well as a team player." 
</P>
<P>
Clark received his bachelor's degree and master's degree in teaching from 
Whittier College and received a Rotary Foundation fellowship for a year's 
graduate study in urban and regional studies at Birmingham University in 
England. He also studied public administration at Cal State Fullerton and 
received a certificate in effective management from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is married and has a son, Philip, who is 12. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Clark said that he was aware of the split in growth 
philosophies among Escondido council members and had experienced "the same kind 
of planned growth debate" during his years at Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he planned to "take some time to assess the situation" in Escondido, 
and would make "no pronouncements from the hip" until he had learned more about 
his new position.

1 KILLED, 1 HURT AS GUNMAN FIRES INTO GROUP AT PUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man angry over a fight with his girlfriend shot into a group of people in 
front of the Leprechaun Irish Pub in Van Nuys, killing one bystander and 
wounding another, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
A Salvadoran immigrant, who was not identified, was being sought in the 
shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
George Huck, 20, of Van Nuys was killed by a bullet in the head, and Gary 
Frakes, 20, of Van Nuys was shot in the leg in the incident about 9:30 p.m. 
Wednesday in the 6500 block of Ventura Canyon Avenue, Detective Don Tabak said. 
</P>
<P>
Frakes was reported in good condition at Valley Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Warren Knowles said that an hour before the shooting, a couple had argued 
in the bar and the man, in a jealous rage, struck the woman. The man then left 
but was followed by two other women who caught up with him and hit him back. 
</P>
<P>
He left in his car but a short while later telephoned the bar and "said he was 
coming by to get even," Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
The threat was announced in the bar, and several patrons either left or went 
outside to move their cars from the front of the building, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
"After doing that, they were still standing outside when the suspect drove by," 
Knowles said. "They were clear targets because now there were no cars in 
front." 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fired six to eight shots at the crowd, striking Huck and Frakes, 
police said. The victims apparently did not know the suspect or were acquainted 
with him only through the bar. They had no connection to the earlier fight 
between the suspect and his girlfriend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching for a brown Toyota Celica with white hubcaps that 
officers believe carried at least two men during the shooting.

Six people, including a pregnant woman who had to be rescued from a car, were 
injured Thursday morning in a three-vehicle collision in North Park, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police and firefighters responded to the accident at 10:32 a.m. at 
Texas Street and Lincoln Avenue. All three drivers and their passengers 
suffered minor injuries and were treated at local hospitals, a spokesman for 
the Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The pregnant woman was trapped in a small sedan when its doors, damaged in the 
collision, would not open. It took 10 minutes and a hydraulic-powered prying 
device to free the woman from the car, authorities said.

SHERIFF'S VOLUNTEER HELD IN ATTACK ON WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civilian Los Angeles County sheriff's volunteer was arrested Thursday on 
suspicion of slapping and sexually molesting a Tujunga woman after using a 
police-style flashing red light to halt her car, Burbank police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Nikki Amorosino, 39, was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail on suspicion of 
felony sexual battery, said Sgt. Don Goldberg. Arraignment is scheduled Monday 
in Burbank Municipal Court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old victim, who is married to a California Highway Patrol officer, 
was treated for bruises and scratches at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank 
following the 8 a.m. Wednesday attack, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman wrote down the license plate number of the van that pulled her over, 
and police traced it to Amorosino's Arleta home, where he was arrested, 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Pat Hunter said Amorosino, a self-employed fireworks 
technician, was a volunteer in the department's media resources office in 
Whittier, which produces training films for deputies and recruits. Officials in 
the office could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Goldberg said 
sheriff's officials told him that they had ended Amorosino's connection with 
the department because of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pulled in Front of Car 
</P>
<P>
Police said the assault occurred after Amorosino repeatedly pulled in front of 
the woman's car as she drove south on Buena Vista Street. When the woman 
attempted several times to pass Amorosino's slow-moving van, he caught up with 
her and again pulled in front of her car, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Amorosino then pulled alongside the woman's car, put a flashing red light atop 
his van and motioned for the woman to stop, Goldberg said. The woman, thinking 
that the man was a police officer, stopped and got out of her car at Buena 
Vista and Victory Boulevard, Goldberg said. Amorosino, enraged and shouting 
obscenities, ran up to the woman, identified himself as a sheriff's deputy, 
grabbed her arms and slapped her head, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Amorosino then allegedly threw the woman against the side of his van, reached 
under her blouse and grabbed her right breast, Goldberg said. When the woman 
yelled "Rape!," Amorosino returned to his van and drove off, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Police searching the van after Amorosino's arrest found a red light believed to 
be the one used to stop the woman's car, a sheriff's deputy's cap with badge, a 
pair of handcuffs and several explosive devices, Goldberg said. The Los Angeles 
Police Department bomb squad was called to take custody of the explosives, he 
said.

WARNER CENTER OFFERS INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYEES TO SHARE RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Warner Center business group Thursday announced a $400,000 package of 
financial incentives aimed at doubling -- to about 4% -- the proportion of 
employees riding van pools to work. 
</P>
<P>
Among the inducements to get workers out of single-occupant cars and into 
15-passenger vans are fare subsidies and a free ride home in the event of an 
emergency that keeps an employee at work late or requires him or her to leave 
early. 
</P>
<P>
The free rides home will be by taxi or rental car, said Christopher Park, 
manager of the Warner Center Traffic Management Organization, which is 
administering the program. 
</P>
<P>
Also, those who have been with a van pool for 11 months will get the 12th month 
free under the program "to hold onto those we now have in the van pools," Park 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly fees for van pool riders range from $52 to $65, depending on distance. 
</P>
<P>
The incentive program is being financed with money from the Los Angeles City 
Council-created Warner Center Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Voit, Warner Center's major developer, was required by the council to 
place $5.5 million into the fund, which is controlled by the city's 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street Widening 
</P>
<P>
Besides subsidizing ride-sharing, the fund is being used to widen streets and 
improve traffic signalization in an effort to offset the traffic impact of the 
center's 35,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The council in recent years has been requiring major developers to underwrite 
traffic improvements and ride-sharing programs for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 26,000 workers employed by the 19 firms that have formed the Traffic 
Management Organization, 17% car pool to work, about 2% ride van pools and 1% 
ride buses, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
He said fewer than 1% ride bicycles or walk to work.

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST MAN IN 15-YEAR-OLD SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge dropped charges Thursday against a San Fernando man recently arrested 
in connection with a 15-year-old slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber dismissed a charge of involuntary 
manslaughter against Juvenal Camarena Mena, 51, of San Fernando, who had been 
arrested on suspicion of murder during a routine traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael E. Plotkin asked that the case be dismissed because 
the law requires prosecutors to file involuntary manslaughter charges against a 
suspect within three years after a crime is committed. 
</P>
<P>
Mena originally was charged with murder in the Jan. 12, 1974, shooting of 
Carlos Rodriguez Camacho, 32, during a drunken argument. That charge, which is 
not covered by statute of limitation laws, was reduced to involuntary 
manslaughter after Mena's arrest in February because of a lack of evidence in 
the 15-year-old incident. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando police said Thursday that witnesses had identified Mena as the 
gunman, but that investigators were unable to locate him. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to numerous family members," Detective David Harvey said. "Nobody 
knew where he was. After awhile, you can't keep up with every arrest warrant 
ever issued." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owns Business 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin said his client owns a house and a wrought-iron business in San 
Fernando, where he has lived for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They screwed up," Plotkin said of the police. "They had 15 years to arrest 
him, and he was sitting right here in his house in San Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
Mena was arrested in Burbank in February after he was stopped for a traffic 
violation. But prosecutors said they were unable to locate witnesses to the 
shooting and could not pursue a murder charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, witnesses told police that Mena and Camacho had 
been drinking at Camacho's apartment when the two began arguing. 
</P>
<P>
Mena left. But as he got into his car, Camacho came after him and they fought, 
a witness told police. The witness said he heard a gunshot before Mena drove 
off. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Mena told police he was afraid of what the victim might do, 
so he pulled out a shotgun and aimed it at Camacho. He said that he did not 
intend to kill Camacho, but that the victim grabbed the barrel of the gun and 
it went off.

NERDS GETTING THEIR REVENGE IN GRAND STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY COREY, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For decades, schoolyard bullies yanked the clip-on tie from his neck, stole his 
pocket protector and broke his black-rimmed glasses so often that only reams of 
tape held the frames together. 
</P>
<P>
But the archetypal, Grade A, never-met-a-math-equation-he-didn't-like nerd -- 
who shunned sports the way other students avoid homework -- is getting the 
ultimate revenge. 
</P>
<P>
He's becoming hip. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In malls, nightclubs and classrooms nationwide, many young adults are emulating 
the straight-arrow style of the math and science whiz ridiculed for so long. 
Shirts are being buttoned to the collar. Pant legs end before the ankle to 
reveal -- egads! -- white socks. Thick black-framed glasses cover eyes that 
often have 20/20 vision. 
</P>
<P>
"The nerd begins in the 1950s as a victim and he rises in the '80s to be a 
hero," says Richard Martin, a fashion expert. 
</P>
<P>
But if there's one thing that separates today's chic nerd from his 1950s 
predecessor, it's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the nerd has been portrayed as socially maladroit, while his more 
recent counterpart wears his mismatched plaids and high-water pants with cool 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be very self-confident and somewhat conceited to do this," says 
Christopher Pallo, a 25-year-old art director with a Baltimore publishing 
company who abandoned his preppy ways for nerd chic several years ago. "You 
know that you're not dressed like everyone else, but you still look good." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Huppert agrees. "It's calculated, it's extreme. The things are often all 
cotton, linen or silk," says the 35-year-old furniture store co-owner. "You 
wouldn't see somebody trying to pull this off in a brown textured polyester 
suit." 
</P>
<P>
Witness the birth of the neo-nerd. 
</P>
<P>
In composite form, he's an artsy intellectual, a young city dweller. He shops 
secondhand and listens to musicians like the Smiths, the Proclaimers and Billy 
Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
(Experts agree, by the way, that nerds and neo-nerds are strictly male 
phenomena. "But I'm sure Madame Curie was a nerd," says one.) 
</P>
<P>
The pejoratives for outcasts date to the early '20s, when geek first surfaced 
as carnival slang for a snake charmer and later came to mean a sideshow freak 
who bit the head off a live chicken, according to Robert Chapman, author of the 
"New Dictionary of American Slang." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evolution of Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Nerd followed in the early '50s, with dork coming into vogue a decade later. 
Although the '80s have brought us dweeb, Chapman sees geek making a comeback 
among teen-age name-callers. 
</P>
<P>
"Geek has been around for a long time, but it's finally coming into its own," 
says the lexicographer, who saw the word used a dozen years ago by students at 
Drew University in New Jersey to berate their college president. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the evolution of the neo-nerd fashion trend, however, involves more 
guesswork. Martin first noticed shirts being buttoned to the collar in the 
early '80s, after art students grew tired of the contrived fuchsia hair and 
black leather of the punk movement. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the trend had been anticipated by new wave rockers such as Elvis 
Costello and David Byrne of the Talking Heads, whose underground music helped 
introduce neo-nerd fashion to the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Flickering Image 
</P>
<P>
TV also deserves credit for upgrading the image of the geek. More than a decade 
ago, Bill Murray and the late Gilda Radner sounded the nerd alert on "Saturday 
Night Live" by playing the love-struck dweeb couple Lisa Loopner and Todd 
DiLaMuca. Today, Elvis Costello, wearing his signature geeky glasses and clunky 
work shoes, takes his latest single, "Veronica," to the top of video charts on 
MTV. And Pee-wee Herman is transformed from dork to comic darling on Saturday 
morning TV. 
</P>
<P>
Mike MacDonald, a former scientific computer programmer and self-professed 
outcast, has made a career out of the belief that "everybody, at one time or 
another, has felt like a nerd." Nearly three years ago, he created Rent-A-Nerd, 
an Illinois-based company that sends dorky-looking characters to ham it up at 
bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations and even office meetings with such 
quips as "I long for the day our pocket protectors meet" and "Hey, babe, want 
to floss in the moonlight?" 
</P>
<P>
What has really surprised this entrepre-nerd, as he calls himself, is the 
popularity of his characters, especially his alter ego, Hornby K. Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the hippest people think Hornby's cool," says MacDonald, 29. "Isn't that 
an oxymoron -- a cool nerd? But he's been called cool because he's totally 
satisfied with himself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respect for Brains 
</P>
<P>
Chapman attributes the turnaround to a new reverence for intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"The cycle that we capsulized with the Me Generation, which was extremely 
hedonistic and basically anti-work, may be turning around a bit. Now that we're 
losing our primacy in technology, we've tried to stimulate pride and sound the 
alarm. The one thing that has happened has been that the image of the eggheady 
guy with the helicopter cap on his head has changed to someone who isn't quite 
as repulsive." 
</P>
<P>
If society is beginning to re-evaluate the importance of technology, it also 
seems to be redefining its norms for male beauty. And what once might have been 
considered unattractive has done an about-face. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that it's difficult today to define what the norms of 
male beauty are," Martin says. "With the male stars of the '30s or '40s, 
everyone knew: It had to be the Latin lover or the blond god. Today, there's a 
certain body-aware type -- a (Sylvester) Stallone or (Patrick) Swayze. . . . 
But there's also more latitude." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Rueful Confession 
</P>
<P>
As neo-nerd fashions enter the mainstream, many who observe the trend can't 
help but see the paradox in transforming once-dorky attire into high fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"The validation or redemption element is part of the irony," Chapman says. 
"(Neo-nerds are making) this one rueful confession: 'Yeah, you nerds were right 
about something, but I'm also right. This requires that I not dress exactly 
like you. I'll wear these few tokens, but I'm still behaving in a cool way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Martin is the curator of "From Jocks to Nerds," a recent exhibit chronicling 
men's fashion trends at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, who 
recalls spending his adolescence in "funny short-sleeved shirts buttoned to the 
collar." For former nerds like him, the popularity of the neo-nerd style does 
have a special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel vindicated," he says. "The nerd can have some kind of 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
But have things improved for the stereotypical dork -- the young physicist or 
budding mathematician who lives for final exam week? 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't done a . . . thing," says Rent-A-Nerd owner MacDonald. "Kids are 
still kids. Everyone still picks on the (real) nerds."

AN ENVIRONMENTALIST FOR ALL SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Felicia Marcus lives only a block from the Santa Monica Bay, yet she rarely 
gets over to see it. That's because she has been so busy trying to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus is an environmental activist and lawyer -- neither especially remarkable 
on the issue-oriented Westside. But in addition to belonging to a myriad of 
environmental groups, she is a founder of Heal the Bay, the burgeoning 
volunteer organization that has successfully pressured the City of Los Angeles 
to stop dumping sewage sludge into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
As a key strategist in Heal the Bay's ongoing campaign, Marcus has spearheaded 
what is arguably one of the most effective grass-roots environmental campaigns 
of the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Felicia is extraordinarily committed," says Jan Chatten-Brown, environmental 
affairs assistant for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who has known Marcus for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's had a significant role in Heal the Bay's success because of the 
way she has chosen to pursue issues, combing through the existing laws that are 
already on the books, persuading public officials to listen. She has given Heal 
the Bay credibility by taking careful, analytical positions on the various 
legal issues." 
</P>
<P>
What Marcus emphasizes is an overview of systems. "Everything is connected -- 
if you throw something away, it goes somewhere," she comments. "Who we are as a 
society depends on how we take care of things." 
</P>
<P>
She is a particularly good example, say friends and associates, of the kind of 
person who got involved in environmental issues long before it was trendy, and 
who has done it the old-fashioned way: by learning what the Clean Water Act 
really says, the structure and vulnerabilities of storm drain and sewer 
systems, the real potentialities of recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Board memberships give some indication of her depth of commitment: Coalition 
for Clean Air, Environmental Quality Board, League of Conservation Voters and 
National Estuary Program are only a few. 
</P>
<P>
"I have breakfast meetings every day and evening meetings almost every night, 
and I read when I get home, mostly environmental studies and engineering 
reports," she said, adding ruefully, "I don't know when I last read a novel." 
</P>
<P>
And all that is in her spare time -- outside her work. Marcus, who lives in 
Venice, is director of litigation for Public Counsel, the Los Angeles County 
and Beverly Hills bar associations' public-interest law firm -- the nation's 
largest -- which provides legal services to the poor in areas ranging from 
children's advocacy, immigration, civil rights and consumer issues, to housing 
discrimination and homelessness. "It makes a nice balance," says Marcus, of her 
ambitious two-part career. "I do get tired, running from one thing to another. 
. . . But I know hundreds of interesting people. It gives me a lot in return." 
</P>
<P>
And although neglect of the environment may have been the rule up to now, 
Marcus thinks the tide is turning. "This is a great time to be an 
environmentalist," she proclaims with characteristic optimism. "We can fix this 
stuff!" 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in her mid-Wilshire office -- a sea of paper, posters, files, cardboard 
boxes and books -- Marcus, 33, apologized for serving coffee in a 
non-biodegradable plastic foam cup ("I've been meaning to bring in some paper 
cups") and talked about the particular challenges of being an environmentalist. 
Her conversational style is disarming, spilling over with facts, figures, case 
studies and philosophic reflections. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a clear issue, like race discrimination, where there are rights and 
wrongs," she said. "It's a huge number of facts, and to be an effective 
advocate, you have to know what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tedious Work 
</P>
<P>
And despite a certain glamour to the idea of saving the air and water, the 
reality is tedious plugging. (One of Marcus' working memberships is the Sewer 
Limitation Ordinance Citizens Advisory Committee). 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know how a recycling plant works and how a sewage treatment plants 
works," she said. "It can bury you in paper work and meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, until recently, environmentalism didn't seem a very urgent or 
especially compelling issue. While civil rights or the plight of the homeless 
might provide passionate conversation at a dinner party, the primary screening 
of sludge was hardly a topic to be introduced along with the coffee and 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it wasn't a topic that Marcus herself focused on when she began 
thinking about a career. She grew up in the San Fernando Valley and graduated 
from Birmingham High School. "It was the end of the '60s activism," she 
recalls. "The students just behind us were more interested in sock hops. I was 
a current-affairs person. I read all the newspapers and Time and Newsweek." 
</P>
<P>
She went to Harvard, where, intrigued by China, she majored in East Asian 
studies and learned to speak Chinese -- with the notion of being an influential 
academic. "I was going to enlighten foreign-policy makers. I planned to write 
important articles for Foreign Affairs journal, concentrating on Sino-Soviet 
competition in the Third World, pulling all these things together. It was a 
grand scheme." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change of Plans 
</P>
<P>
But after a year on a fellowship in Hong Kong, she decided it might not be 
foreign policy that intrigued her, but just the intricacies of policy per se. 
Maybe the domestic front offered more opportunity than foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
That notion was confirmed when she went to work in the Washington office of 
Rep. Tony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
When Beilenson needed a legislative aide to work on environmental affairs, she 
"snapped it up," and was on her way. It was the late 1970s and the oil crises 
of '74 and '79 had sparked a national interest in energy programs. Beilenson 
was spending a lot of time on the Santa Monica Mountains, offshore oil drilling 
and the Channel Islands National Park -- all issues Marcus found challenging 
from a policy perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's undeniably important and the trade-offs are fascinating in terms of how 
to sensibly run our affairs. Look at the oil drilling battle that has gone on 
and on, and the battle to figure out a sensible energy policy. It just gets to 
the core of things." 
</P>
<P>
She was fascinated by the intricacies of environmental problem-solving and the 
discovery that solutions exist. "We have great environmental statutes on the 
books -- the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. (But) I could see that law 
school would be a necessary tool." 
</P>
<P>
She went to New York University and specialized in environmental law, thus 
joining a rather select community. "There just aren't that many people who like 
to read EIRs (Environmental Impact Reports). I do -- it's fun, like a puzzle, 
because it involves large-scale governmental decisions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Came West 
</P>
<P>
She liked the East Coast life style, but in 1983 she came home because "the 
things I care the most about are here." And she believed that, more than in an 
Eastern city, "Los Angeles is a place where things can change. The government 
is more open, we are moving from our first stage to our second stage." 
</P>
<P>
She joined a small group on the Westside that was protesting a request by the 
City of Los Angeles to continue dumping partially treated sewage into the Santa 
Monica Bay (which sweeps from Palos Verdes to Malibu). 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 they formed Heal the Bay. "There were six of us in Dorothy Green's 
living room in Westwood," says Marcus. "It was a remarkable, caring group of 
people with a common approach -- a willingness to dive into details and a 
willingness to pound tables." Their timing was right -- the group has enjoyed 
spectacular growth and recently passed the 6,000-member mark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Jumped In' 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Green, president of Heal the Bay: "Felicia was there at the very 
inception and she jumped into it with both feet." 
</P>
<P>
Heal the Bay joined in an EPA lawsuit against Los Angeles because the city was 
in gross violation of the Clean Water Act. The pressure on the city and its 
neglected sewage treatment plant took many other forms -- letter-writing, press 
conferences, demonstrations at the beach after sewage spills and buckets of 
sludge carried in protest to the Water Board meetings. Eventually Heal the Bay 
was invited by the courts to monitor the city's 12-year cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
Says Green: "Felicia wrote briefs, letters to the judge and helped to negotiate 
with the city how best to fulfill their obligation. She has a remarkable legal 
mind and an ability to synthesize technical and legal issues." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus also gets high marks for diplomacy from L.A. Deputy Mayor Mike Gage. "I 
first met Felicia in City Hall when she was representing Heal the Bay in a 
meeting with our city engineers and sanitation folks. They were a bit on pins 
and needles -- here was somebody who'd filed a suit against them. But even 
though she was an advocate for her position, I felt she worked very well with 
people theoretically on the other side. She was clear, cogent, insightful and 
easy to work with. She defined the issues well and set the parameters for 
resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus emphasizes the conciliatory approach. "You don't just go in shouting, 
'Raw sewage is bad and you've got to stop pouring it into the bay!' You have to 
understand the basic characteristics of the storm system and the sewage system. 
You have to realize that everything that gets flushed down the toilet ends up 
in the bay. You have to suggest solutions." 
</P>
<P>
And, she added, you realize that your adversaries are not terrible people. 
"Sanitation engineers don't go to school so they can preside over the 
deterioration of waste systems. People can work together on these things." 
</P>
<P>
Heal the Bay's brochures can now boast that no new sludge is going into the 
ocean, that sewage is being fully treated, and that, while many more cleanup 
measures are needed, a healthy start has been made. 
</P>
<P>
And Marcus, who can vigorously rattle off the number of outlets in the city's 
storm drain system and explain the need for pumping stations throughout the 
sewage system (it's not an all-gravity flow system), says: "I can look at the 
Santa Monica Bay and know we have made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsung Dedication 
</P>
<P>
Observers note that Marcus is one of a number of dedicated, unsung watchdogs 
who are seeing a phenomenon many thought they never would -- popular opinion 
coming around to their way of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create a political climate where it is appropriate to be an 
environmentalist, and I think this is happening." 
</P>
<P>
The old conventional wisdom -- that in Southern California you don't mess with 
peoples' cars or their trash -- is no longer applicable, she maintains, ticking 
off the evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The City of Los Angeles is committed to the most ambitious recycling plan 
in the country. That's astonishing! 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The City of Los Angeles has enacted a sewer limitation ordinance, limiting 
building permits. This would have seemed impossible just a few years ago, when 
they were even denying the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The City of Los Angeles voted to support air quality management." 
</P>
<P>
So while others may bewail the deterioration of air and water in Southern 
California, Marcus looks around and sees a "lot of newborn environmentalists 
appearing all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an interesting time for those of us who've been environmental 
infrastructure nuts," she says. "It's like the time has come. With any kind of 
social activism, you have to keep beating the drums for years and years, you 
have to be there and not get disheartened. Now it's very exciting because the 
public's consciousness is raised. They are starting to demand accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time to be an activist."

ARCHITECTURE: MEMPHIS GROUP FOUNDER SEES WORK AS CHILD'S PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ettore Sottsass, the godfather of Italian New Wave design, goes about creating 
his brightly colored eccentric furniture, architecture and interiors like a 
child at play. 
</P>
<P>
"My deepest images are the ones I recall from kindergarten building blocks," 
the 72-year-old designer said. "From the regime of education, professional 
training, technological method and brute necessity, my mind escapes to my play 
blocks like a kid let out of school." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Sottsass founded the influential Memphis Group, whose building-block 
creations influenced Post-Modern design at every level. Using bold geometric 
shapes, primary colors, vivid textures and a wide palette of materials, the 
group created a wide range of radical designs, from European showrooms for 
Fiorucci and Esprit to Olivetti typewriters and lighting for Knoll. Sottsass' 
famous "Treetops" floor lamp, for example, has a perky yellow metal hat perched 
on a long curve of peach-colored steel tubing that slides into a green 
triangular boot at the base. It is, like all Sottsass designs, not just a 
functional object but a personality in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Sottsass completed his first Los Angeles design -- the 
Mayer-Schwarz gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. The gallery's dramatic 
doorway, made up of irregular folds and jagged angles of multicolored terrazzo, 
leads into a space Sottsass described as "a metaphysical place." The gallery 
interior is cool white, offering respite from the busy sidewalk beyond the 
powerful doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Sottsass also designed a pagoda in Malibu for art collector Max Palevsky, as 
yet unbuilt. He currently is building houses for clients in Ridgeway, Colo., 
and Maui, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
On his most recent visit to Los Angeles, Sottsass described the personal events 
that led him to join with other "radical" Italian designers Aldo Cibic, Matteo 
Thun and Marco Zanini and art historian Barbara Radice to form the influential 
Memphis Group in Milan in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Modernism 
</P>
<P>
"We were in reaction to the cerebral Modernism that ruled Italian -- and 
European -- design in the decades after World War II. A narrow functionalism 
dominated every field, from architecture to industrial design. Objects as large 
as buildings or as small as lamps were locked into an often elegant but 
generally sterile 'honesty' of use expressed in their purist shapes. Emotion 
was eliminated as sentimental." 
</P>
<P>
In an exhibition catalogue written in 1980, Sottsass shocked modernists with 
the confession that he chose materials such as spongy paper from government 
account books and mosaics of public conveniences that abandoned any 
intellectual intent or expectation. 
</P>
<P>
In halting but expressive English peppered with evocative phrases, Sottsass 
explained that he offers no ideological system but rather a collage of 
thoughts, which he calls a series of private gossips. 
</P>
<P>
Though a resident of Milan, where he shares an apartment with Radice, Sottsass 
considers himself a foreigner everywhere. "Milan is so moral and modernist in 
its ethos, so obsessed with its design purity, that they scowl at my 
frivolity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking about this "foolish purity," Sottsass' ancient bloodhound eyes and 
lugubrious mustache are lightened by a charming grin. 
</P>
<P>
Sottsass' destiny began in Innsbruck, Austria, where his Italian father was an 
architect. He graduated in architecture from the University of Turin in 1939, 
"just in time for World War II." After six years of army service, Sottsass, 
like the rest of his countrymen, found himself in a country devastated by 
Mussolini's failed ambition to create a new Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Struggles 
</P>
<P>
The young architect starved and struggled until the late 1950s, when Olivetti 
commissioned him to design a computer housing system for its newly created 
electronics division. 
</P>
<P>
"For me the computer was a magic cabinet, a kind of electronic divinity that 
had to be clothed in somber and systematic armor," he recalled. "I was still a 
strict modernist, laboring at design as if it were a purely mental exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Two very different streams of influence converged to begin Sottsass' conversion 
to non-rational design. One was the deep impact made upon him by a 1961 visit 
to a 1,000-year-old Indian temple with "paving stones polished by the wax of 
millions of ancient candles and by the bare feet of marvelous dancing girls." 
The other was '50s U.S. pop design with its freewheeling informality -- the 
polar opposite of high-minded European purity. 
</P>
<P>
These disparate emotional experiences were intensified by the political and 
social upheavals of the '60s, in Europe and the United States. Sottsass met 
radical poet Allen Ginsberg and several of the leaders of the 1968 Paris 
student uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"These people and events, joining the wellspring of my own feelings, led me to 
reject the designer's role as a slave of the consumerist system," he said. 
"There had to be a way in which everyday objects, whether mass-produced or not, 
had to recover their sensorialita -- their emotive power as personalities in 
their own right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Withdrew 10 Years 
</P>
<P>
The name Memphis, Sottsass explains, came about quite casually. "A bunch of us 
were sitting around drinking and listening to Bob Dylan's 'Memphis Blues.' The 
music was so soulful it made us weep into our wine." 
</P>
<P>
To rethink his notions of design, Sottsass more or less withdrew from 
professional activity for a period of 10 years, in favor of pure play. In 1972 
he produced a series of fantasy architectural drawings titled "The Planet as 
Festival." 
</P>
<P>
The series, which became an icon of radical thinking in the '70s, illustrated 
the myth of a society with only leisure time. Freed from work, citizens were 
entertained in phallic temples by erotic experiences and other electronic 
events. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of sly and gnomic wit informed Sottsass' explorations in the '70s and 
became integral to his '80s designs. The fanciful highway for ants and small TV 
for butterflies led directly to his more practical bookcase for fallen books 
and the quirky shapes, textures and striking color contrasts that give all his 
objects a tremendous sense of personality. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Sottsass does not see himself as an artist but as a designer. He vehemently 
resists the notion that his designs, like art objects, belong in a gallery, a 
trend that has become increasingly prevalent in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider all my works to be notes leading toward some unknown end," he said. 
"They are not personal dreams bound by their own self-obsesssed logic, but 
items meant to enhance the daily life of their owners and viewers. I prefer 
them to be used with delight rather than contemplated in awe."

RAIL REVIVAL IS A TERMINAL CONDITION IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SILK, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, Boston's South Station looked like a haunted house. Long dark 
corridors snaked through it. Pigeons roosted in its perpetual twilight, secure 
in the near-abandoned upper reaches of this massive granite structure. The old 
train station was a grimy and gloomy portal for travelers arriving in Beantown. 
</P>
<P>
The situation seemed beyond hope. Respected planners pronounced that the depot 
would be easier to demolish than renovate. 
</P>
<P>
South Station got a reprieve from the wrecker's ball in 1975 when the 
distinctive architecture of Head House, the terminal's main building, earned it 
a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Now the station is in the final stages of an $80-million make-over and, thanks 
to a railroad renaissance, on its way to a future as Boston's transportation 
hub. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Money Helping 
</P>
<P>
Like several other train stations in the Northeast, including terminals in 
Hartford and New Haven, Conn.; New York City; Wilmington, Del., and Washington, 
South Station is benefiting from its share of $2.2 billion of federal money 
earmarked to improve the Northeast railway infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, stations are 
being renovated, and tracks, bridges, tunnels and catenary (the overhead wire 
system that powers today's trains) are being improved and repaired. 
</P>
<P>
The newly renovated Boston station preserves the neoclassical revival 
architectural style that wowed travelers passing through the portals of what 
may once have been the country's busiest railway terminal. In 1916, nearly 
twice as many travelers passed through South Station as through Grand Central. 
</P>
<P>
Like Grand Central, South Station was built as a double-decker station; trains 
arrive and depart from two levels. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the renovated terminal will also feature direct road access to 
the Massachusetts Turnpike, a bus station and shuttle service to Logan Airport. 
Basic renovation to the station itself should be completed this fall, 
developers said. New road accesses and the bus station will be built later. 
</P>
<P>
The reborn South Station will serve as more than a transportation center. 
Everything from fresh croissants to gourmet-to-go meals will be available in a 
two-story food hall inside the station. Restaurants, shops and kiosks selling 
flowers, newspapers and magazines will also be built in the newly enclosed 
Grand Concourse, once an open-air platform nearly the size of a football field. 
</P>
<P>
Developers behind Boston's South Station project say they do not expect 
tourists to flock to the new station, though shopping and restaurant facilities 
will attract office workers from nearby financial, retail and leather 
districts, as well as residents of the Ft. Point Channel and Chinatown areas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really part of the growing downtown business district," said Robert 
Flack, senior project manager for the Beacon Cos., developers of the South 
Station renovation. Besides, he said, tourists would not easily be lured away 
from the popular shops and restaurants of the historic Faneuil Hall area. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other single factor, the increasing popularity and practicality 
of railroading has put South Station back on track as a transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the train has become an enticing option for commuters tired of battling 
Boston's semi-permanent gridlock and fed up with the hopeless quest for a 
downtown parking space. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, Flack says, the number of commuters opting to take the 
train has doubled to more than 15,000 daily. And he says that number is 
expected to double again by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak is booming, too. Ridership beat all records in the 1988 fiscal year as 
the company posted its first billion-dollar-plus year. And in 1989, ridership 
may be even higher. Amtrak can hardly keep pace with the increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're splitting at the seams," Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said. "We just 
don't have the space to handle all the people who want to ride." 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak has always attracted plenty of riders in the Northeast, particularly 
business people shuttling between cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Boston 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distance Demand Growing 
</P>
<P>
In the last three or four years, there also has been an unprecedented demand 
for long-distance travel. Low-priced package deals made train travel more 
appealing to vacationers, said Marian Jordan, a travel agent at Executive 
Travel in Newington, Conn. Now passengers hoping for a berth in a sleeping car 
should make reservations months in advance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Increased air fares and Amtrak's new and more user-friendly schedule sent 
ridership soaring, U.S. Travel Data spokeswoman Julie Bowers said. And, she 
said, "they've done a heck of a lot of advertising; that can't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Black attributes the ridership resurgence to increasing disenchantment with 
airlines and frustration with crowded highways. In trains, he said, passengers 
are free to move around, socialize or simply contemplate the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their reasons, travelers are rediscovering America's railroads. 
Renovated terminals such as South Station add their own allure to riding the 
rails.

COUNCIL DOESN'T BUDGE ON 'POLITICAL' CHANGES IN ARTS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite an impassioned plea by the chairman of the Commission for Arts and 
Culture, San Diego City Council tentatively refused Wednesday to amend the 
"political" decisions of a council committee that denied funding for 
avant-garde Installation Gallery and overturned the commission's action 
blocking funding for a half dozen other groups. A final council vote will be 
taken June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Milton (Mickey) Fredman, chairman of the arts commission, passionately urged 
the council to reconsider last month's Public Services and Safety Committee 
vote and to stand, instead, behind criteria established this year for 
allocating money to arts groups. The council committee added six groups to the 
arts commission's funding list of about 70 organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Fredman said that the commission had been established to end a politicized 
approach to arts funding. Councilman Bruce Henderson acknowledged that the 
Public Services and Safety Committee vote to fund groups such as the African 
American Museum was "a political decision." 
</P>
<P>
Fredman said it was unfair to the organizations that followed the criteria to 
fund other groups that successfully lobbied the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Organizations which followed the criteria are now put in an uneven position by 
the organizations that didn't follow the criteria," Fredman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out to the arts community, and 90% said fine, we'll do it. Ten percent 
said to hell with you. We'll go to the council who have friends on our boards." 
When asked, however, Fredman did not name the organizations he claimed had 
lobbied City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Fredman agreed that the six institutions recommended for funding by the Public 
Services and Safety Committee were all deserving. He suggested a compromise in 
which those groups -- including the newly organized African American Museum, 
the Automotive Museum, the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater, the Maritime Museum, 
the San Diego Inter-Museum Promotion Council and the Westgate Mainly Mozart 
Festival -- be funded a small amount this year but compete for substantial 
increases in 1990, when an additional $2 million will be added to the 
commission's current $5.28-million allocations budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mayor Maureen O'Connor called for further study by the city manager's 
office, the City Council closed ranks and pointedly reminded members of the 
fledgling arts commission that they were advisers only, and that the council 
members make the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Fredman acknowledged that Installation Gallery had suffered financial 
difficulties, including a reportedly $6,000 debt, but claimed "it is not fair 
to take a nine-year organization and cut them down to nothing." At issue is a 
proposed grant of $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty disagreed, saying, "Installation did not meet my 
criteria." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a problem with Installation because we funded them last year and they 
weren't able to get through the fiscal year," McCarty later explained. "If (the 
gallery) can't win support of San Diegans, why are we giving them support? 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when a politician is not able to raise money for a campaign, it's 
because they don't appeal to the people. I guess artists are the same way. If 
they're not able to raise money, they can't convince people they're any good," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the city manager's office recommended reducing the arts 
commission's administrative budget by $127,000 to pay for part of the 
additional $346,000 approved by the Public Services and Safety Committee. The 
remainder is to be paid from the city's funds for downtown maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
If the cut is approved, the position of public arts administrator would remain 
vacant until fall, said the commission's executive director, Victoria Hamilton.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' SHRINKS IN 
CAVERNOUS BAY THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Steel Magnolias," the off-Broadway hit and soon-to-be movie about five women 
who bare their souls and wicked wit in a Louisiana beauty shop, may not be 
coming to San Diego's Civic Theatre after all. 
</P>
<P>
The producers put on hold plans for the road show, starring Barbara Rush and 
Marion Ross, after the play was panned when it opened in San Francisco's 
cavernous Curran Theatre. The critics fired some well-earned barbs at the 
frankly sentimental but true story -- it's a "Terms of Endearment" with a twist 
of Southern Comfort. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest culprit, which most critics overlooked, was the theater, not 
the script. The play shriveled in the acoustical barn of the Curran, which 
serves as a pointed reminder that the Old Globe Theatre was wise to back A.R. 
Gurney in his insistence on "The Cocktail Hour" playing in the intimacy of an 
off-Broadway house rather than a Broadway theater. 
</P>
<P>
Intimate shows such as "The Cocktail Hour," which takes place in a living room, 
and "Steel Magnolias," where the talk is in a small-town salon, cry out for 
close, comfortable settings with no need for microphones. 
</P>
<P>
If the tour drops San Diego, theatergoers could still benefit if an 
enterprising producer can acquire the rights to present an independent 
production in a house that fits the play better than the behemoth Civic 
Theatre, giving five actresses the roles of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Still on tap for the San Diego Playgoers' season is "Forbidden Broadway," a 
takeoff on Broadway shows, most of which should prove familiar to San Diego 
audiences. It includes "Into the Woods," which becomes "Into the Words," the 
San Diego Playgoers' upcoming "Cats" and "Starlight Express," retitled 
"Starlight Excess," and, of course, the inevitable "Phantom of the Musical." 
"Forbidden Broadway" plays Tuesday through Sunday at the Civic Theatre, 
followed by "A Chorus Line," June 27-July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Anderson ("Night Court") will headline the July 8 finale of the 61st 
International Brotherhood of Magicians at San Diego Civic Theatre. Nightly 
demonstrations at the Civic Theatre from July 5-8 will feature 1,500 magicians 
from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
John Hirsch, the director of last year's contragate-inspired "Coriolanus," had 
to drop his commitment to direct "Measure for Measure" for the Old Globe this 
summer when he was leveled by tuberculosis. Hirsch, back in his Toronto home 
after seven weeks in the hospital, said he was glad his replacement will be 
Adrian Hall, recently deposed artistic director of the Dallas Theater Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really looking forward to going back to the Old Globe," he said by 
phone. "I had one of the best times I ever had working with Jack (O'Brien, 
artistic director) and the other people there." 
</P>
<P>
He firmly dispelled any suggestion that the money quarrel between the 
Directors' Guild and the League of Regional Theaters played any role in his 
decision to cancel his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick," he said, adding that he sympathizes with both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who are free-lancing and doing major productions spend three to 
four months doing a show, and the amount they are able to pay us is meager. At 
the same time, theaters are still dealing with financial problems and living in 
a time when it's very hard to survive. I don't know what is going to happen at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
What do you do when your last show is an unqualified flop? If you're the 
Progressive Stage Company, you produce a new show about the comic pitfalls of 
putting on a flop. That's why the Progressive is readying the San Diego 
premiere of Terrence McNally's "It's Only a Play" for a June 22-July 23 run, 
said producing director Carlos X. Pena. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last show ('House of Correction') was a turkey, so we thought we would put 
on a play about putting on a turkey," said Pena. " 'It's Only a Play' is about 
the Broadway opening of a show called 'The Golden Egg.' Everybody gets 
(maligned): the writer, director, actors, critics, even the preview audiences. 
I just hope San Diego has a good sense of humor about its theater scene." 
</P>
<P>
On the boards for August is Tom Stoppard's "Travesties," a romp through 
20th-Century ideas with Lenin, James Joyce and Tristan Tzara, the father of 
dadaism. For late fall or early winter, Pena plans the world premiere of a 
musical, "A Few Hours in Hell" by local musician Stu Shames, who will start 
workshops next month for his story about the only cabaret in hell. 
</P>
<P>
Local actress Trina Kaplan will be supporting more than the show she's acting 
in this weekend. Along with husband Ted, Kaplan, who plays the gleefully 
shrewish mother-in-law in "The Mandrake" at the North Coast Repertory Theatre, 
is sponsoring the O'Neill Playwrights West readings at the Gaslamp Quarter 
Theatre Company on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The O'Neill Playwrights West, which formed on the picket lines of last year's 
Writer's Guild of America strike, is made up of playwrights who attended the 
famed Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Conn. Three readings of new 
works to be presented on the set of "The Day Room," still playing at the 
Gaslamp, include "First Draft" by Yale Udoff at 11 a.m., "V.D. in Safe Haven" 
by Preston Marshall Ransone at 1 p.m. and "The Prince and the Greaser" by Jon 
Surgal and C. Finestra at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The O'Neill Playwrights West readings, free and open to the public, will 
continue June 24 with "The Big Explanation" by Doug Gower, "The Descent" by 
Paula Cizmar, "Getting Off" by Lee Thomas and "Three for Two" by Michael Robert 
David. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Arts Tix Center is moving to a new location in Horton Plaza and will 
be unveiled at noon June 29. The facility, where theatergoers can buy 
half-price tickets on the day of a performance, will have expanded hours: 
Mondays from 10 a.m.-4 p.m., Tuesdays-Saturdays from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. To get the 
center off the ground, William Purves formed the San Diego Theatre League, of 
which he is president, and then raised the funds to hire the organization's 
first full-time staff member, executive director Alan Ziter. By June, 1986, two 
months after he was hired, Ziter began operating Arts Tix out of a "temporary" 
space in Spreckels Theatre. It took three more years to raise the money to move 
to Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, Ziter reports, Arts Tix, which costs $90,000 a year to 
run, has turned over $1 million to arts organizations by selling their tickets. 
"Now we want to return twice as much in half the time in our new location," he 
said.

Jerusalem's High Court of Justice lifted an Israeli ban Thursday on the 
controversial movie "The Last Temptation of Christ," stating that only an 
extreme attack on a subject justifies limiting free expression. Golan Globus, 
the film's distributor in Israel, welcomed the ruling of the five-judge panel 
and said it will screen the movie next week in Tel Aviv. The Israeli Film 
Censorship Board had banned "The Last Temptation of Christ" in October, saying 
the movie by American director Martin Scorsese would offend Christians and 
violate Israeli law against harming religious feelings. The film portrays Jesus 
as weak-willed and confused about his divine mission. A hallucination sequence 
includes Jesus having sex with Mary Magdalene. ALEENE MacMINN

JAZZ FOR JUNIORS: Youngsters ages 5-13 will get an hourlong jazz concert of 
their own when pianists Steve Allen, Pete Jolly, Paul Smith and Mark Massey get 
together Saturday at 3 p.m. at the La Mirada Civic Theatre. The pianists will 
perform at the theater that evening in a joint benefit for the Children's 
Museum at La Habra and the youth programs of the La Mirada Civic Theatre. 
</P>

said Marcia Giesler, director of development for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The children's concert is free, but tickets -- available on a first-come,

A coal miners' wildcat strike in Virginia and West Virginia escalated, with 
roving pickets expanding their walkout to a northern West Virginia coal field, 
Island Creek Coal Co. officials said. The company's southern West Virginia 
mines, employing about 190, have been shut down since Monday as striking 
workers ignored a federal judge's back-to-work order. The walkout spread to 
other Island Creek mines employing 875 people. At least 10,000 miners are 
estimated to be idled by the strike. The walkout began as a show of solidarity 
with 1,600 United Mine Workers members in West Virginia and Virginia on strike 
since April against the Pittston Coal Group.

A Merced County farmer whose foreclosed ranch is being considered for a kit fox 
sanctuary says the proposal would destroy his chances of rebuilding the farm. 
Tom Castle of Morgan Hill says he legally has the first right to buy the 
683-acre ranch he defaulted on last fall. But if two government agencies get 
their way, the land will be converted to permanent pasture and then restored as 
a habitat for the endangered fox. "That's a real good idea, except nobody's 
ever seen a kit fox on this land," said Castle's lawyer, Karen Russo of 
Woodland.

As city officials in Tiburon agonized over how to get rid of the carcass of a 
30-ton gray whale that washed up on the beach, would-be good Samaritans hauled 
it out to sea. But it came back, smelling worse than ever. This time it was in 
Pacifica, about 15 miles south of Tiburon, and its stench wafted along Main 
Street's scenic restaurant row, several hundred yards from the beach. Police 
Lt. John Gurney said Pacifica authorities were not taking any chances with the 
41-foot whale that was estimated to have been dead two weeks. After conferring 
with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, Pacifica officials 
decided to have the beast sliced into pieces, loaded on a truck and buried. The 
body was hauled away to a landfill site in Livermore.

PEOPLE: JUST AS REGISTERS GO OUT, WAL-MART BOSS DROPS IN

<P>
Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton pitched in to help the clerks at his store in this 
Panhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be among the world's richest people, 
grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started writing out prices for the 
customers so that bills could be tallied on calculators quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him," said store 
manager Paul Sively. "He shook their hands and talked to everyone he could. The 
registers were out for about 45 minutes, and I don't think we had one customer 
complain." 
</P>
<P>
Walton, known for his down-home style, had dropped in because country singer 
Jana Jea was to perform later that night in the store's parking lot. Walton 
often attends promotional events for the Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said 
he had suspected that the boss might make an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Walton continued to chat with customers during the concert and also took the 
stage to sing a duet with Jea and lead the audience in the Wal-Mart cheer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was up there saying, 'Give me a W! Give me an A!' and the customers went 
right along with him," Sively said.

Integrated Resources Inc.'s stock price plunged nearly 50% Thursday after the 
insurance and mutual fund company said it was halting payment on $864 million 
in short-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated, which has $7.8 billion in assets, said the problem affects only the 
parent company and not its affiliates and subsidiaries nationwide, which would 
continue to make payments to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, banks withdrew Integrated's access to short-term credit markets 
amid signs of weakening financial condition at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated said it did not have the money to pay off its debt, including some 
$373 million in commercial paper and loan shares that come due in the next 45 
days. The debt payments amount to about $8 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated also has $491 million in short-term bank credit lines mostly payable 
on demand. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock plunged $5.75 to close at $6.25 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Thursday. Volume was 1.7 million shares, about four times the 
trading activity on Wednesday. The stock closed at $15.375 on Tuesday.

On other markets, oil futures prices rose; precious metals were higher, and

Crude-oil futures finished higher but well below the day's highs on the New

Singer-actor Howard Keel, saying it has taken him more than 37 years to get 
across town from the MGM lot to the Greek Theatre, will finally make his Los 
Angeles concert performance debut when he appears as a special attraction July 
15 at the Greek. During his years at MGM, he starred in a score of musical 
films, including "Show Boat," "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Seven Brides for Seven 
Brothers." For the last several years, he's been on the lot working as Clayton 
Farlow in the long-running CBS series "Dallas." This fall, he'll be heading out 
for his fifth concert tour in five years of the United Kingdom. ALEENE MacMINN

NBC's daytime series "Santa Barbara" and an episode of "L.A. Law" -- in which a 
Chicano leaves East Los Angeles to become an attorney in the non-Latino world 
-- won the 1989 Imagen Latino media-image awards Thursday for their strong 
portrayal of Latinos. The Legacy Group, which hands out the annual awards, also

Showing astonishing strength for a Top 10 novice, Fine Young Cannibals 
continues to hold down the No. 1 position on the Billboard magazine pop album 
chart -- its fourth week on top. The Jacksons' "2300 Jackson Street" is showing 
early signs of bombing, moving up only two notches to No. 63 in its second 
chart week. Another potential bomb -- Diana Ross' slow-starting album, "Workin' 
Overtime" (No. 144). The hottest new pop album is Stevie Nicks' "The Other Side 
of the Mirror" (No. 15). Two other veteran singers are having chart troubles: 
Aretha Franklin's album "Through the Storm" (No. 67) fizzled fast and is 
slipping down the chart; Paul McCartney's "Flowers in the Dirt" debuted at No. 
66. 
</P>
<P>
* The debut album by this young female singer/rapper has critics raving. Fans 
are also wild about Neneh Cherry, whose album entered the chart impressively -- 
at No. 58. Her "Buffalo Stance" single, which helped create the buzz about her, 
is No. 3 and could be the next No. 1 pop single.

Picketers from a dozen or so community groups who appeared on KVEA Channel 52's 
doorstep Wednesday in Glendale, and then went inside to protest the alleged 
under-representation of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the station's senior 
management, appear to have had at least one of their demands met. Donald G. 
Raider, vice president and chief operating officer of KVEA's parent Telemundo 
network, contacted the demonstrators by telephone from New York and offered to 
meet with their representatives June 28 in Los Angeles, protest organizers 
said. Roxanna Brightwell, a network spokeswoman, confirmed the report. ALEENE

MOVABLE FEASTS: PICKING OVER THE CHICKEN EATERIES AROUND THE SOUTHLAND

A Martian landing in Los Angeles and looking around would undoubtedly conclude 
that we live on a diet of doughnuts and chicken. There's a doughnut shop on 
every corner and a chicken shop somewhere nearby. Everywhere you look some poor 
bird is being roasted, grilled or spun on a spit. 
</P>
<P>
Doughnuts don't do much for me, so I decided to look into the chicken shops. 
Herewith the results: 
</P>
<P>
PHIL'S FISH AND POULTRY 
</P>
<P>
Phil's Poultry and Fish is the best place in the L.A. area I can think of for 
really fresh prepared chickens. They're the Norman Rockwell of roast chickens: 
full-breasted, golden-brown (I hate the phrase but it's true) and that perfect 
combination of juicy within and crunchy without. The chicken is delivered six 
times a week, cooked on the premises, and well worth the cost -- $3 per pound. 
The thing to remember about Phil's is that the chickens sell out fast. Get 
there by 4 p.m. or call ahead; they'll reserve one for you. 
</P>
<P>
Phil's Fish and Poultry, 428 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, (213) 274-0817; 
11640 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood, (213) 820-5853; 124 Larchmont Blvd., 
Hancock Park, (213) 462-6611; 12107 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 761-5121. 
Open Monday-Friday 9 a.m.-6 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Cash and checks 
only. 
</P>
<P>
REDDI-CHICK 
</P>
<P>
Regulars of the Reddi-Chick chicken 'n' rib stand are passionate in their 
devotion to the place. How do I know? I'm a regular myself and have waited in 
line there more times than you can say buk, buk, buk. Chickens cook on the spit 
at all times of day, and unsalted birds can be ordered ahead over the phone. A 
$4.95 Reddi-Chick basket gets you a quarter chicken with either French fries or 
the crispest, lightest cole slaw you can imagine. For $6.50, you get a whole 
chicken, cut up if you like, with a thick, mild barbecue sauce on the side. 
Besides the fact that you'll find yourself in the middle of movie star heaven 
(keep your eyes open), what else can I tell you? The skin's so luscious, it's a 
good thing the bird is double-wrapped in foil or it would never make it home in 
one piece in my car. 
</P>
<P>
 Reddi-Chick, Brentwood Country Mart, 225 26th Street, Santa Monica, (213) 
393-5238. Open Monday-Saturday 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Cash and checks only. 
</P>
<P>
ZANKOU CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
Zankou Chicken, with its Middle Eastern ways (falafel, hummus, baba gannouj . . 
.) has classic rotisseried chickens. But to my mind, the best things about the 
place are the late-night hours, the prices and the wonderfully sour borg -- 
small, buttery pastries filled with spinach and cheese at a dollar apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Whole chickens are $5.50 and come with a pile of soft pita, as well as a 
special horseradish-textured garlic cream. Crazy as I am about garlic, this 
brew tastes one-dimensionally raw to me. The green salad ($1.25), on the other 
hand, is splendid with a fine garlic vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
The Zankou's falafel I tasted was artillery-weight, the hummus awfully salty, 
and, maybe it's unfair, but by the time (30 minutes) the chicken reached home, 
the meat was on the dry side. But if you're in the neighborhood, stop in for 
those terrific, freshly made borg. 
</P>
<P>
 Zankou Chicken, 5065 W. Sunset Blvd. (corner of Normandie), Los Angeles, (213) 
665-7842. Open seven days 11 a.m.-midnight. Cash only. 
</P>
<P>
CHICKEN NATURAL 
</P>
<P>
The hearts freely splattered on the menu at Chicken Natural tell you that the 
American Heart Assn. approves of this place. And if you want to know exactly 
how many calories your bird might add to your bulk, all you have to do is scan 
the wall. Emblazoned for all to see are the hard stats: Half a Chicken Natural: 
558 calories. A 1/4 chicken, white meat: 264. A 1/4 chicken, dark meat: 294. 
</P>
<P>
All excess fat is removed from these fryers but they still manage to stay 
tender and moist. Marinated for 24 hours and cooked without any salt in a 
combination rotisserie-open-wood fire, they're, in a word, plain. (Though they 
do make a nice chicken salad the next day.) A whole chicken, with tortillas and 
salsa, runs $7.95, or $10.99 with 2 pints of side dishes. Among these side 
kicks I like the cole slaw, tossed with sweet carrots and raisins, best. The 
potato salad tastes like mashed potatoes, much too smooth. The dishwater beans 
are what a 6-year-old friend of mine calls "bor-ing." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken Natural, 3120 Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles, (213) 478-9797. Open 
seven days 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Free local delivery 5-9 p.m. (with $8 minimum 
order). 
</P>
<P>
EL POLLO LOCO 
</P>
<P>
The American Heart Assn. takes off its hat (or opens its heart?) to El Pollo 
Loco too. I have to agree: the chicken is pretty wonderful here. Consistently. 
This is a place where an assembly-line system works. Watch the fresh (not 
frozen) birds, marinated in a "secret combination" (management won't say more 
than "fresh fruit juices, herbs and spices"), go from a brilliant saffron color 
to glistening brown on a raft of open flames. Served with a generous portion of 
corn or flour tortillas and a refreshing salsa, a whole chicken is $7.89. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the side dishes are more than ordinary: pinto beans ($1.89 per pint) 
are spicy and full of spunk; the potato salad is dashed with peppers and 
agreeably mustardy; the Spanish rice is pleasant; the cole slaw's freshly made. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pollo Loco, 118 locations throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY CONNECTION 
</P>
<P>
Ralph's new Beverly Connection store across from the Beverly Center cooks up 
roast chickens at least three times a day. And the place is open non-stop, 24 
hours, just in case chicken's on the brain at 4 a.m. All good signs. You feel 
even better when you have a taste of Ralph's firm, fresh cucumber salad ($3.99 
lb.) laced with fresh dill, and the smart peppery, green-onion-potato salad 
($3.29 a pound). That's why it's hard to figure why Ralph's roast chicken can 
be so undercooked. Who could tell from the nice, brown skin? (My mother taught 
me not to poke through shrink-wrap . . .) Of course, even big boys are entitled 
to a mistake, especially when they offer those mistakes, salted or salt-free, 
at $2.49 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph's Beverly Connection, 100 N. La Cienega Blvd., (213) 655-6226. Open 24 
hours a day. Delicatessen open 7 a.m.-10 p.m. Chickens are ready by 9:30 a.m. 
and put in a warmer case after the deli staff goes home. Cash and checks.

STAGE BEAT : 'TALK STORY (CHAPTER 2)' BY GREAT LEAP; 'N.Y. ACTS' AT THEATRE 
6470; 'TRISTESSA' AT AL'S BAR; 'PERICLES' AT THEATRICUM BOTANICUM 
</P>

<P>
A musical revue can cut two ways. Each piece must be brief, or at least, to the 
point. A blessing, especially if a piece isn't working. Not a blessing, 
especially if we want more than the piece gives us. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk Story (Chapter 2)," a visiting production by the performance group, Great 
Leap, at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, cuts very much both ways. We could do 
with less of the failed sensuality of "Pilipino Tango," or the dead-end 
dialogue in "Two Nisei Women" or the vague and strained seriousness of "The Man 
Nobody Sees" and the finale, "Path to Soul." 
</P>
<P>
We could do with more of the characters suggested in "English Lesson" (Young-Ae 
Park's young immigrant woman struggling with Kenny Eiland's insensitive 
boyfriend) or "Color of Love" (Nobuko Miyamoto's daughter trying to explain her 
interracial marriage to father Jose De Vega). Maybe chapter three of "Talk 
Story" should spend more time on fewer stories. 
</P>
<P>
The tone ranges as far as the multicultural L.A. map the revue observes. This 
can also be troublesome: Miyamoto's music, lyrics and book can be precise, as 
in "Schizophrenic" (Deborah Nishimura's hip woman torn between rap and tai 
chi), or can overreach and become corny, as in "Family Business" and "Feels So 
Good." The company, under Daniel Kwan's direction and Park's choreography, 
dances better than it acts. Unfortunately, the mostly poor singing voices have 
to be miked to be heard over the well-produced, recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
 At 514 S. Spring St., on Fridays, 8 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays, 2 and 8 p.m., 
through July 16. Tickets: $17-$20; (213) 627-5599. 
</P>
<P>
'New York Acts' 
</P>
<P>
Assignment for playwrights throughout the ages: Create a problem for your 
characters, then try to solve it. Whether it's Marvin L. Seiger's '50s-era 
"Blue Concerto" or Michael Patrick King's contemporary "Me and We" -- a pairing 
of New York-based one-acts at Theatre 6470 -- the assignment hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither has the problem, despite the time lag between the two plays. The 
dilemma in both is an impossible, unfulfillable quest for love. In "Concerto," 
Helen (Janet Borrus) loves Harry (Eric Kohner), her young, partially paralyzed 
husband who's partially in control of the rage he feels over his fate. She's 
been having an affair with a virile, sensitive jazz trumpeter -- the Brando 
character (Tim deZarn) -- who lives upstairs and delivers chicken soup, but the 
guilt is getting the better of her. Each has an object of love just out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
That is the theme Seiger puts across best. But the play's age (37) shows in the 
strained poetic naturalism and melodrama that director Jill Holden's cast 
nevertheless keep as tight a lid on as possible. This is the kind of play Paddy 
Chayefsky cut his teeth on. 
</P>
<P>
Expressions of the New Age movement rarely succeed on stage, perhaps because it 
is too easy a butt of satire. Writer-director King, with "Me and We," 
approaches the New Age -- in this case, channeling -- on its own terms. The 
results weave a surprisingly complex web.

Charlie (Alexis Genya, who extracts comedy from the smallest bit of behavior) 
is a living catalogue of pent-up urban neuroses. She appears to be a basket 
case next to Rena, the calm -- too calm -- channeler (Alexandra Summer, in a 
very fine, matter-of-fact performance). From here, King reveals shades of 
schizophrenia, moral outrage and love as only a playwright who has thought 
about his subject can. New Agers will not be amused by his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 At Theatre 6470, 6470 Santa Monica Blvd., on Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 
p.m., until June 24. Tickets: $10; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Tristessa' 
</P>
<P>
Like Jack Kerouac's writing, James Terry's production of the Beatster's 
"Tristessa" sinks into valleys of sloth-like self-indulgence and rises to 
moments of unexpected inspiration. Seeing it outdoors in the Al's Bar parking 
lot, the evening chill increasing by the minute, makes for a distinctly urban 
theater experience. This doesn't conceal the fact that there's barely a play 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack" (like Henry Miller's, Kerouac's central character was almost always 
himself, romanticized) has been around a lot of demanding types, but the ones 
he encounters in his trip to Mexico are beyond hope. There's Tristessa 
(beautiful but dull Dagmar Stanec), a woman he falls for. There's her 
morphine-addicted compadres, El Indio and Cruz (Roberto Santana and Marrianne 
Bergonzi, both grungy to the hilt). And there's Bull, a drug-smashed expatriate 
(the very droll Brian Brophy) that only Malcolm Lowry could love. 
</P>
<P>
Since they're beyond hope from the start, there are very few directions for 
them, except further down. The only concern is whether Jack's going down with 
them, but Peter Freiberger's pallid take on the artist makes this a slender 
thread to hold on to. 
</P>
<P>
What is left is the narration -- there's little dialogue -- read in a 
wonderfully transfixed and silken style by Steve Andrews, standing in a suit 
before a circa-'50s off-stage mike. Kerouac's syncopated curlicues of language 
fly better on the air than they do on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 At 305 S. Hewitt St., on Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m., through June 30. 
Tickets: $10 (part of proceeds to benefit AIDS L.A.); (213) 829-3547. 
</P>
<P>
'Pericles' 
</P>
<P>
What a movie "Pericles" would make. Adventure, duels, comedy, tragedy, women of 
ill repute, women of virtue. The only problem is that hardly anyone knows 
"Pericles." Isn't it one of those plays Shakespeare supposedly didn't write? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no. "Pericles" has the Bard's hand all over it, especially in how he 
wastes no time putting Pericles, Prince of Tyre, into a terrible pickle: He 
either wins the beautiful princess's hand, or loses his head, depending on 
whether he correctly answers King Antiochus' riddle; but the correct answer 
requires him to accuse Antiochus of incest. Sorry choices, casting the Prince 
on a wild, "Odyssey"-like journey of bad fortune. 
</P>
<P>
The bad fortune is quelled by a lot of last-minute good grace, like another 
late, equally odd and seldom-seen Shakespeare work, "Cymbeline." It takes good 
actors to make this ship run. 
</P>
<P>
At Theatricum Botanicum, director Ellen Geer's actors often do a better job of 
having fun than putting the play across (a recurrent problem with this group). 
George McDaniel swallows his lines as Antiochus, but comes on strong as 
Simonides and the buffoonish Boult. Thad Geer is a bore as Cleon. Turning the 
narrator Gower into a four-person, sing-song chorus might have worked with 
decent singers. David Anthony Smith's Pericles and Melora Marshall in the 
traditional double-role of Pericles' wife and daughter are sound emotional 
anchors for a tempest-tossed plot. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., on Sundays, 1:30 p.m., through Aug. 27. 
Tickets: $11 (under 12, free); (213) 455-3723.

<P>
The Peter Pan Players' production of "Alice in Wonderland" has enough whimsy 
and magic to make Lewis Carroll proud. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's staging at Iglesia Community Park in Laguna Hills follows Alice's 
fantasy romp through day-glo daisies, past a smiling Cheshire cat, a bellowing 
queen and a break-dancing king. Directed by Saul Siedman, the show includes 58 
local children, some of whom shared characters with another cast that took over 
after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour show, targeted for very young children, featured Courtney Weber 
and Monica Bromberg as Alice, Kimberly Reed as the White Rabbit, Angela Gage as 
the Queen of Hearts and Nathaniel Dawkins as the King. 
</P>
<P>
Children in the audience giggled through the show's flights of fancy, including 
Brett Levisohn's delirious Mad Hatter, the Cheshire cat's glow-in-the-dark 
smile and the shrinking Alice. After a bite of the mushroom, Alice disappeared 
behind a fungus and emerged as a girl half her size (played by 3-year-old 
Danielle Martino). 
</P>
<P>
The play was choreographed by Jill Kaplan, costumes were created by Jena 
Bouvion and Patricia Reed and scenery was designed by Helen Danielson. 
</P>
<P>
The show is sponsored by the Orange County Department of Harbors, Beaches and 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alice in Wonderland" continues this weekend at Iglesia Community Park, 24671 
Via Iglesia, Laguna Hills. Performances at 1 and 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. 
Sunday. Tickets: 50 cents for mat seating and $1 for chairs. Information: (714)

Christophe Boutin, a French artist working in Los Angeles, is engaged in a 
curious attempt to yoke a couple of opposites: ponderously symmetrical lead- 
and gold-covered wooden rectangular framing elements and biomorphic 
drip-covered paintings executed in a muted and deliberately restricted palette. 
The results manage to be neither visually satisfying nor intellectually 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged in massive steplike formats, the lead and gold blocks suggest an 
inert, would-be grandeur. The canvases look grimly programmatic, like a 
humorless attempt to prolong the legacy of Clyfford Still. Some of these pieces 
also contain arrangements of three-dimensional gold letters -- some placed 
upside down or on their sides -- none of which seem to spell out a legible 
message. Another group of works -- executed at Boutin's 71 rue Blanche address, 
as the titles proclaim -- involves pairs of gold foil-wrapped letters of the 
alphabet (the foil is partially peeled away, like boxed chocolates ransacked by 
idle hands) superimposed over brown-toned photographs, mostly of male heads and 
wire fences. 
</P>
<P>
There might be issues of identity or language buried somewhere in this piece, 
but Boutin isn't giving anything away. His fondness for gold -- which also 
surfaces in a lone bell glass-encased sculpture and in another piece containing 
multiple copies of the gleaming invitation card for the show -- comes across as 
little more than a vacuous fascination with luxe. A viewer thinks of ormulu 
objets in a pretentious apartement, and fails to see the rigor behind the 
gesture. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to July 1.)CATHY CURTIS

In a group of recent pieces called "Parables: Rings/Spheres," Los Angeles 
sculptor Michael Davis offers imagery associated with astronomy. Most are wall 
pieces in which small metal circular elements are poised on arcs and circles 
fitted into a large ring shape. Pleasing arrangements of formal elements, they 
are crafted from domesticated industrial materials (copper, steel, cement), 
plus gold-leaf. Sometimes, Davis slides into a tidiness that seems too 
decoratively ingratiating. But the larger problem is that his obvious love of 
materials and craft tends to trivialize the symbolic qualities he claims for 
these pieces. How, one wonders, could such a pretty face have anything to say? 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious work on view is a three-part installation, "Parables." One 
part consists of a black globe suspended in a large vat of rusty liquid. 
Chalked on the globe -- and revised daily -- are headlines from the morning 
paper. Another portion is a big copper arc curving around a corner at chin 
level and balancing variously sized metal and glass balls spaced at intervals, 
like planets. The third element is a gold sphere placed at the center of a huge 
steel ring hanging on the wall. A light source on the opposite wall makes the 
sphere appear to cast a bright crescent of light on the cloudy darkness of the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
This piece seems to embody references to pollution (the water) and other 
earthly screw-ups that have consequences for the biosphere and beyond. Perhaps 
some of the glass planet-spheres have rolled out of their proper alignment. But 
we are straining to find particles of meaning here. A disproportionate amount 
of content is coming from the newspaper headlines, and not enough from the 
work's formal elements. 
</P>
<P>
Several models and drawings showing Davis's conceptions for large public 
projects -- among them, "Grand Promenade" for Grand Street adjacent to the 
Museum of Contemporary Art and again demonstrate his finesse in coming up with 
elegant conjunctions of silhouettes and materials. But the metaphorical 
content, when it exists, generally sounds flat and unconvincing. (Karl 
Bornstein Gallery, 1658 1/2 10th St., to July 1.) CATHY CURTIS

Andrew Stevovich's paintings defy categorization and that's always good. The 
label of social realism doesn't quite fit his '30s garbed men and women 
crowding theaters and cafes. The women look like those straight-nosed, 
full-lipped damsels from Pre-Raphaelite art, but Stevovich distorts and 
flattens his figures just enough to give everything the doughy, unshadowed look 
of folk work. Details are edged with a fine black line that adds a fussy sense 
of precision and truth-to-fact, but you soon conclude that his ripe imagination 
has choreographed every stilted gaze and gesture. In "The Audience of the Club 
Durango" a dozen figures dressed in their post-Depression best are crammed into 
a tight agitated composition. Depicted only from the waist up, the sea of white 
faces looks furtively aside, their hands tug nervously at clothing, they 
whisper or lurk in the background to caress. (Tatistcheff Gallery, 1547 10th 
St., to July 8.) MARLENA DONOHUE

Simon Gendler doesn't make pretty paintings. He didn't have a pretty life. He 
grew up in the Soviet Union and watched his father -- a middle-class Russian 
Jew -- exiled to Siberia with hundreds of other Jews during the repressive 
1940s. As an adult, he moved to the city and fell under the influence of the 
dissident "nonconformist" group, putting his despair to creative ends by 
painting. A few local shows since his arrival in the United States in 1980 have 
featured agonized figures and crucifixes in jarring colors. 
</P>
<P>
In current works, despair seems replaced by a scary cynicism. Lurid, thickly 
bright paint expresses bodies twisted into carnival grotesques. "Holy Family" 
features a Madonna who looks like a dissipated lady of the night and a teeny, 
apprehensive holy child trapped in paint. In Russian, the nonconformists were 
known to starve themselves for days so that hunger and depression heightened 
creativity. It is easy to use the word excessive when you've been raised in 
American comfort, but one can't help but notice both the excess and promise in 
Gendler's Neo-Expressionist works. (Boritzer Gray Gallery, 3110 Main St., to 
July 9.) MARLENA DONOHUE

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NEWS COVERAGE HIGHLIGHTS CHINA'S VIDEO REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
On the screen Wednesday night was Ted Koppel in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the screen Wednesday night was Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, it had been almost the reverse: Koppel was doing ABC's 
"Nightline" from his usual New York base, and Futterman was grabbing occasional 
glimpses of America on the television set in his Beijing hotel room when he 
wasn't on the streets covering one of the major stories of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference 48 hours made. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little bit of surrealism as I saw the latest footage from Tian An 
Men Square," said Futterman, a reporter for NBC/Mutual Radio, who had just 
returned from three weeks of intense China duty that included witnessing the 
military's bloody repression of protesting masses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Futterman was happy to be back in the United States with his wife 
and young son. On another level, however, he sat in his suburban home watching 
"Nightline," feeling the immediate past merge with the present and thinking: "I 
was there. The story was five minutes away from me on a walk. I'm on the 11th 
floor. Let me go outside the hotel. Let me take a walk through the city. The 
story is still going on and I should be there." 
</P>
<P>
But now others were there. Reflecting the increasing difficulty in transmitting 
from China these days, Wednesday's "Nightline" was glitch-ridden. Koppel's 
interview of two American journalists expelled by the Chinese -- supported by 
still pictures of himself and them transformed from videotape -- was 
prematurely halted when the audio went dead. 
</P>
<P>
Switching to a phone, Koppel then interviewed syndicated columnist Anthony 
Lewis, who was on camera in Boston. ABC had Forrest Sawyer standing by to 
conduct the Lewis interview from New York had communications with Koppel failed 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
If not smooth, it was an interesting program, noting at once the limits -- and 
amazing powers -- of TV. There were, of course, the latest chilling revelations 
that the Chinese government was using foreign TV footage to track down student 
leaders. There was also the latest on Chinese TV's present role as a 
revisionist historian, either softening or obliterating the awful truth of 
recent events in China. 
</P>
<P>
In a very different way, however, TV's influence had been evident much earlier. 
As Lewis pointed out, "The very fact of the world watching (pro-democracy 
demonstrations by students in China) was having an impact on the reality." 
</P>
<P>
Futterman agrees. "The students were so clever and so media-savvy," he said. 
"Many of the leaders had been to the U.S. and had seen the media machine work, 
and they knew the game. They knew we were there, and they knew exactly what 
they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled the night, about a week before the crackdown, that the students 
erected the "Goddess of Democracy" in the square. "There was a whole gang of 
reporters there, and none of us spoke Chinese. So they had this girl doing all 
this stuff on the P.A. and speaking English just to keep us aware of what was 
happening. And after each line, she would add, 'Thanks a lot,' as if she were 
saying, 'Have a nice day.' " 
</P>
<P>
The students announced the start of their final hunger strike by issuing two 
press releases, moreover. One in Chinese, the other in English. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that media awareness is ever expanding, giving birth to a generation 
of video commandos who become the unofficial eyes of TV in places where access 
is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
"The video revolution has made the world so much smaller that you now have 
these amateurs taking their little video cameras everywhere, and then leaking 
stuff to the press," said Futterman, who may be right in attributing growing 
media consciousness worldwide largely to the global reach of CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to have given the world a certain mindset about news," he said. 
"When I go to Poland, my brother-in-law wants to know about (CNN Headline News 
anchor) Bobbie Battista." 
</P>
<P>
Given that mindset, the Chinese government's decision to not impose total 
censorship booting out all of the foreign press remains a puzzle. "It's so easy 
for them to get rid of us," Futterman said. "They know where we are. They know 
what hotels we're at. Why they have allowed us to stay there is a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
Another mystery is whether the fickle media -- especially network TV, with its 
limited minutes and intolerance for nonviolent international news -- will 
eventually tire of the China story without having to be expelled. Just as 
Central America, South Africa and other hot spots rise and fall in the public 
mind depending on media access and coverage, so too may China and bittersweet 
memories of Tien An Men Square.

HOME TECH: CD PACKAGE SALUTES THE ALLMAN BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At its peak, the Allman Brothers Band in many ways was the Grateful Dead with 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jerry Garcia and company, the Allmans -- whose blend of country and blues 
strains defined Southern Rock in the late '60s and early '70s -- frequently 
engaged in marathon jams on stage, sidestepping visual flash for sheer 
instrumental authority and grace as it wove an almost magical spell over the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
But the band -- which framed the superb guitar interaction of Duane Allman and 
Dickey Betts against one of rock's most accomplished rhythm sections -- 
injected the music with an energy and tension that was more consistently 
involving than the Dead's. 
</P>
<P>
The Allmans' era -- starting with brothers Gregg and Duane's early Allman Joys 
and Hour Glass bands, but reaching its creative peak with the emergence of the 
formal Allman Brothers Band in 1969 -- is saluted in an extraordinary 
four-disc, 55-track retrospective that will be released Tuesday by PolyGram. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Dreams," the boxed set will sell for around $55 in CD (it'll also be 
available in vinyl and cassette). The set was produced by Bill Levenson, who 
also put together "Crossroads," last year's Grammy-winning Eric Clapton tribute 
set, and contains an illustrated, 36-page history of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a generous serving of familiar Allman numbers (including "Whipping 
Post," "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" and "Ramblin' Man"), "Dreams" offers more 
than two hours of rare or previously unreleased demos, alternative takes and 
remixed material. The latter ranges from an Allman Joys' demo of the Yardbirds' 
"Shapes of Things" to a live, 1973 rendition of "One Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
Though the musical flavor of this tragedy-riddled band shifted at several 
points (both Duane Allman and bassist Berry Oakley were killed in separate 
motorcycle accidents in the early '70s), there is a surprisingly strong 
continuity of vision. The original passion and drive of the band continued even 
after leader Duane Allman's death at 24 in 1971, and on into the music offered 
by Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts when they started their own rival bands. 
</P>
<P>
There have not been half a dozen more musically compelling bands in American 
rock than the Allmans, and "Dreams" underscores the point. The set commemorates 
the group's 20th anniversary, a celebration that will include the first U.S. 
tour since 1980 by Betts, Gregg Allman and drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe, 
the four remaining members of the 1969 edition of the Allmans. 
</P>
<P>
ALSO NEW: Capitol Records' reissue of satirist Stan Freberg's wildly ambitious 
musical panorama of the country's founding, "Stan Freberg Presents the United 
States of America," contains two sketches that weren't on the original 1961 
package. They are "The Discovery of Electricity" and "The Midnight Ride of Paul 
Revere." . . . The sound quality is spotty on Island Records' "Scandal Ska" as 
most of the 16 selections on this survey of early '60s Jamaican ska were dubbed 
from records because the master tapes were presumably unavailable. But the 
package is noteworthy because it contains Bob Marley's first record ("Judge 
Not") as well as numbers by Jimmy Cliff, Desmond Dekker and Laurel Aitken. 
Already available in Britain, the album will be released here July 17.

HOME TECH: LUCY'S SHOWS, MOVIES SET FOR VIDEO CASSETTE RELEASE

<P>
The death of movie stars often revives interest in their old films, suddenly 
turning those stars into hot properties in the home-video market. Lucille Ball, 
who died April 26 at 77, was recognized as more of a TV star than a movie 
queen, but she's about to become a home video star too. 
</P>
<P>
CBS-Fox is rush-releasing a series of cassettes of her "I Love Lucy" TV shows 
-- due out June 23. Previously available only by mail-order through the CBS 
Video Club, this will be the first time that shows from her most famous series 
will be sold at retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Turner Home Entertainment is releasing some of her old movies -- 
comedies mostly -- in September, in black and white, not colorized. 
</P>
<P>
Up until now, Ball hasn't been big in the home video market, which is geared to 
movies rather than repackaged TV shows. She did appear in more than 50 
features, beginning in 1933, but most of them either were B-films or featured 
her in small parts. She is best known for her television work, which continues 
to be available in reruns. 
</P>
<P>
Already there are indications that Ball's death has boosted interest in her 
movies. Turner marketing executive Martin Weinstein cited a marked increase in 
the demand for three of her movies -- "Five Came Back" (1939), "The Affairs of 
Annabel" (1938) and "Room Service" (1938), featuring the Marx Brothers. "Five 
Came Back," a drama about the survivors of a plane crash in a South American 
jungle, is, some critics say, her best dramatic film performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, orders for these three movies are about a few dozen a month," 
Weinstein said. "But since Lucy died, the orders have increased to a few 
hundred a month." 
</P>
<P>
Now CBS-Fox is gambling that, since her death, fans will want to own copies of 
her classic "I Love Lucy" TV shows. There are four $14.98 cassettes, each 
including two half-hour shows, totaling 51 minutes. Among them are "Lucy Does a 
TV Commercial," "Lucy and Harpo Marx," "Lucy's Italian Movie," "Lucy Goes to 
the Hospital" and "L.A. at Last," featuring William Holden. 
</P>
<P>
According to CBS-Fox marketing executive Mindy Pickard, these eight shows are 
the most popular of the 179 episodes of the series, based on books and fan club 
feedback. She added that these cassettes were originally scheduled to come out 
in the fall but, figuring Ball's death would create a demand for them now, the 
release date was moved forward a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Since these shows are constantly reshown on broadcast television, why would 
fans want to purchase the cassettes instead of taping them for free? 
</P>
<P>
"These are the complete, unedited versions," Pickard explained. "These contain 
minutes that are edited out of the TV showings to make more room for 
commercials. They would appeal to the real, hard-core Lucy fans." 
</P>
<P>
CBS-Fox will continue to put out these shows on cassette, with more releases 
tentatively scheduled at the beginning and the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Entertainment, meanwhile, will release 18 Ball movies this fall at 
$19.98. Most are re-releases that have been repackaged. Only three titles are 
previously unreleased: "I Dream Too Much" (1935) with Henry Fonda, "Look Who's 
Laughing" (1941) with Edgar Bergen, and "Seven-Day Leave" (1942). 
</P>
<P>
Most of the films in the Turner package are from Ball's RKO period, 1935-42, 
when she moved up from bit-player to star. Some were previously released on 
Media, VCA and Republic, but the video rights reverted to Turner in May of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Turner titles are: "Annabel Takes a Tour" (1938), "You Can't Fool 
Your Wife" (1940), "Joy of Living" (1938), "Big Street" (1942) and "Easy 
Living" (1949). The package also includes famous films that present Ball in 
only small parts, such as the Fred Astaire films "Top Hat" (1935) and "Follow 
the Fleet" (1936), as well as "Stage Door," the 1937 drama starring Katharine 
Hepburn. Other future stars, Eve Arden and Ann Miller, also are in "Stage 
Door." 
</P>
<P>
There should be a lot of interest in "Too Many Girls," a 1940 Rodgers &amp; 
Hart musical comedy that features Desi Arnaz. As all Lucy buffs fans know, Ball 
met Arnaz during the filming of this movie. 
</P>
<P>
Other Ball movies on video are "Sorrowful Jones" (MCA, 1949), a so-so remake of 
Shirley Temple's "Little Miss Marker," and "Du Barry Was a Lady" (MGM/UA, 
1943), a musical featuring Red Skelton that's most notable for its Cole Porter 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Some Ball movies that are not yet on video include "Fancy Pants," a 1950 comedy 
starring Bob Hope, and "Without Love," a 1945 Tracy-Hepburn vehicle. Most of 
her '60s and '70s films, including "Facts of Life" (1961), "Critic's Choice" 
(1963) and "Yours, Mine and Ours" (1968), are not available on home video. But 
"Mame," which critics called a real stinker, is out on Warner Video. This 1974 
film version of the play "Auntie Mame" was her last feature movie. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy buffs might also be interested to know that "Roman Scandals," a 1933 
musical starring Eddie Cantor and Ruth Etting, is out on Nelson/Orion. This is 
her first movie appearance. She's one of the girls in those gaudy Busby 
Berkeley production numbers.

CHILD-CARE LOANS URGED BY BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flanked by four council members and a host of child-care advocates, Mayor Tom 
Bradley on Thursday called for creation of a revolving $150,000 fund that would 
offer loans to people who wish to open child-care centers in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to bolster the stock of child-care facilities in Los 
Angeles. According to city estimates, 53,000 children are cared for either in 
large centers or in individual homes -- and another 50,000 children, at 
minimum, are denied space because of the dearth of child-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the fund, which requires City Council approval, prospective 
child-care providers would receive loans of up to $2,000 to buy toys and cribs, 
meet licensing requirements or help pay for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The city fund initially would assist 85 facilities that could care for up to 
700 children, city officials said, and would help more providers as the money 
is repaid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Beginning' 
</P>
<P>
"It's small right now, but this is a beginning," said Bea Gold, head of the 
nonprofit Child and Family Services, which assists child-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
According to child-care officials, demand for home care is particularly strong 
for babies, toddlers and older-aged school children. 
</P>
<P>
"It is growing and it has been for the last couple of years," said Patsy Lane, 
the city's child-care coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The city has actively pursued child-care strategies in recent years. In 
January, a child-care center that serves 100 children opened in City Hall 
South, and another, near the Convention Center, is expected to open early next 
year. Three others are in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
City policies also give preference when granting city business to firms that 
have addressed their employees' child-care concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering child-care programs has also been a political plum in recent years, 
and the announcement of the proposed loan plan on Thursday brought out not only 
the mayor but council members Joy Picus, Ruth Galanter, Robert Farrell and Zev 
Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sizable Demand Cited 
</P>
<P>
"There's a very sizable segment of the community that desires to have . . . 
family care services," Bradley said in introducing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The program would be open to city residents who have started the 60-day 
licensing process. The loans -- issued at two points below the prime rate -- 
would be repayable within three years. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials stressed that the program would be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some circumstances under which actual grants can be given," 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Lane, the city's child-care coordinator, said that the $1,500 to $2,000 level 
of the loans was reached after talks with industry analysts and child-care 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
If it proves too little, the amount may be adjusted, she said.

GUNMAN'S RAMPAGE LEAVES 1 WOMAN DEAD, 2 WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rampage began about 12:10 a.m. Thursday in a parking lot in Rowland 
Heights, where 39-year-old Leslie Benevides is said to have been talking with a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
Benevides suddenly shot the woman -- believed to be his girlfriend -- leaving 
her in critical condition, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, investigators said, Benevides drove to a nearby home, where he shot two 
more women, killing one and critically wounding the other. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, deputies said, they found Benevides -- owner of a small 
trash-collection business in the Hacienda Heights area -- passed out in a back 
yard lawn chair at the Artesia home of a former girlfriend after she called to 
report a prowler. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that while Benevides "has a history of drug abuse and 
violent behavior," they know of no motives for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
However, the former girlfriend told a reporter that Benevides had threatened 
her life when they broke up in December and she believes that she was next on 
his list Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Scared to Talk 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was "extremely afraid of both 
Leslie and his friends" -- too scared to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could tell you the things I knew," she began, before lapsing into 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
Another acquaintance of Benevides said more. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real jealous about women, and he could get mad real easy," said Robert 
Crasco, 18, who worked for Benevides' trash business for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't figure him shooting nice people like that," Crasco said. "But when 
he's drinking, he can be pretty mean." 
</P>
<P>
The dead woman was identified as Maxine Vance, 34. The other woman shot at the 
Vance home -- Bobby Stoddard, 18 -- underwent surgery at Whittier Presbyterian 
Intercommunity Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The woman shot in the parking lot, whose identity was not released, was in the 
intensive care unit Thursday at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives said that, according to witnesses, Benevides had been 
talking to the woman in the lot at Colima Road and Azusa Avenue when he fired a 
single shot from a rifle. The woman was struck in the head and collapsed on the 
pavement as Benevides fled in his car. 
</P>
<P>
About five minutes after the shooting, Crasco drove by the Vance home in the 
1400 block of Greencastle Avenue and noticed Benevides' car in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think anything of it, because Les is a friend of Maxine's husband, 
Jerry," Crasco said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaware of Visitors 
</P>
<P>
Crasco said he was unaware at the time that there were two other visitors in 
the Vance home -- Stoddard, who had been the subject of Benevides' advances in 
the past, and Billy Brownlee, Stoddard's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Crasco said he was watching television at his home, two houses away, about 15 
minutes later, when Brownlee, who had been asleep in a back bedroom at the 
Vance home, dashed in the front door to say that two people had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran back over there, and there was Maxine, lying on the couch . . . shot in 
the head," Crasco said. "Bobby was on the couch, too, shot in the chest and the 
mouth. . . . Bobby was moaning. Maxine was quiet. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Crasco said he called sheriff's deputies, and they, in turn, called for 
ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Van Mosely said that although Stoddard was unable to speak, she wrote 
Benevides' name on a piece of paper before undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, the former girlfriend in Artesia, who described her 
relationship with Benevides as a long and bitter one, heard a knock on the 
front door of her home in the 11600 block of East 186th Street. She said she 
got up, looked through the peep hole and saw only a shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God he ducked," she said. "If I'd known it was him, I'd have opened the 
door." 
</P>
<P>
Frightened by the shadow at the door, the woman called sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies said they found Benevides unconscious in the woman's back yard. 
His battered trash truck, parked nearby, contained the 9-millimeter rifle 
believed used in the shootings, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
A radio check revealed that Benevides was being sought in the Rowland Heights 
attacks. He was booked at the sheriff's Lakewood station on suspicion of murder 
and jailed without bail.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAPER SAYS RAIDERS RETURNING TO OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports about moves of the Los Angeles Raiders continued Thursday, as the 
Oakland Tribune claimed in a front page story that the Raiders "have all but 
signed a deal to move back to Oakland in the 1990 season." 
</P>
<P>
The story, by sports columnist Dave Newhouse, said that elements of the deal 
include enlarging the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum to 65,000 seats, building 
100 permanent luxury boxes, erecting movable bleachers with 40 boxes, building 
a practice field and clubhouse for the team at the Oakland Port and making a 
cash gift to the team of $15 million to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous published reports in recent weeks that the Raiders are 
about to move to either Oakland or Sacramento. But team representatives said 
this week that, with the team's plan to move to Irwindale faltering, Raiders 
owner Al Davis is prepared to hear offers from the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission for reconstruction of the Coliseum to keep the Raiders playing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting is scheduled today between Davis, Los Angeles Coliseum Commission 
President Richard Riordan and Coliseum private managers Irving Azoff of MCA 
Inc. and Tony Tavaras of Spectacor Management Group at which the Los Angeles 
offer will be heard.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL RADIATION EXPOSURE IN '60S TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal energy department officials Thursday released documents showing that 
dozens of nuclear workers at Rockwell International in Canoga Park and its 
Santa Susanna field laboratory were exposed to excessive radiation levels on 
occasions in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The records reveal no over exposures in subsequent years, and a department 
official described the 1960s events as "minor over exposures" with "no health 
consequences" for the workers. 
</P>
<P>
But the records, provided to The Times by the Department of Energy under the 
Freedom of Information Act, do not include two over exposure events that 
Rockwell officials have said took place in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The records also do not mention the fact that, without admitting liability, 
Rockwell recently paid settlements in at least three workers compensation cases 
involving cancer deaths allegedly caused by radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The documents released Thursday are called "unusual occurrence reports," which 
the DOE requires contractors, such as Rockwell, to file after safety or 
equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Coulter, a spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division, said the firm 
recognizes its "very serious responsibility" to operate safely.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 8 UCLA EMPLOYEES SEIZED IN DRUG BUSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight UCLA employees were arrested Thursday for allegedly selling marijuana and 
cocaine to an undercover campus police officer, officials at the Westwood 
campus said. Five of the suspects work at the UCLA Medical Center, but none was 
involved in direct patient care, a university spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital employees arrested were identified by authorities as Ronald Jones, 
47; Rayford Reader, 41; Adrienne Campbell, 37; Fran Hatcher, 32, and Greg 
Pompey, 36. The others arrested were Carolyn Brown, 45; David Franc, 41, and 
Debbie Franc, 37, university police said. Investigators said they had not 
determined whether the Francs were related. 
</P>
<P>
All of the suspects except Brown were arrested on campus, and they all live in 
Los Angeles, the spokesman said. They were booked at the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's West Hollywood substation for felony possession of drugs for sale, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest quantity of drugs allegedly purchased during the six-month 
investigation was two ounces of cocaine, university police said. None of the 
drugs allegedly sold were taken from the hospital, officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE AT HEAVILY BARRED HOME LEAVES 2 DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two elderly brothers were killed, but two other relatives escaped when a fire 
swept through a heavily barred Baldwin Hills house early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fisher, 61, died as he apparently tried to get through an anti-burglary 
screen on his front door. Fisher, who had one leg amputated, would have had to 
open the door with a key, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, James Fisher, 67, was found by firemen in the bathtub, where he 
had apparently sought refuge. He was taken to Brotman Memorial Hospital in 
Culver City but died 20 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's daughter, LaVerne McLeod, and her husband, Jeffrey McLeod, escaped 
unhurt through a bedroom window. Jeffrey McLeod, a security guard, said he and 
his wife were awakened by the fire but were prevented by smoke and heat from 
getting through their bedroom door to help the two older men. He said they 
escaped through the window by opening a quick-release device on its 
anti-burglary bars. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out shortly before 9 a.m. in the house in the 5500 block of 
Blackwelder Street. The cause is still under investigation, Wells said.

NONPROFIT EMPLOYER OWES BAKER $80,000; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY D.A. PLANS INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK and STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of a nonprofit organization says he is withholding $80,000 owed to 
former Irvine City Councilman C. David Baker because he fears that paying it 
might violate the terms of Baker's sentencing last fall on a check forgery 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, when Baker received a year's probation, he promised a judge that 
he would perform part of his court-ordered community service by doing legal 
work and fund-raising for Sports Kids, a group founded by former Olympian Bob 
Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
But while Baker was supposed to be volunteering his time to Sports Kids, the 
Irvine-based organization provided him with around-the-clock use of a 1989 
Cadillac, according to Executive Director Chuck Foster. And five days before a 
judge declared that Baker's community service had been fulfilled, internal 
organization records reviewed by The Times indicate that Baker was given a 
full-time job with Sports Kids -- for as much as $240,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Baker left Sports Kids in April after working only four months, Foster said, 
and the $80,000 includes compensation as well as repayment of a personal loan. 
Foster said Sports Kids officials rejected Baker's request for an additional 
$24,000 as severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
Baker did not return several calls for comment this week, but his attorney, 
Paul S. Meyer of Costa Mesa, said Baker didn't receive any form of compensation 
during his period of community service and did nothing in violation of his 
sentencing terms. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely nothing improper about the way Dave Baker conducted 
himself while on probation, which he performed above and beyond the intent of 
the sentence," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Evans -- who 
originally prosecuted the forgery case -- said this week that he intends to 
investigate Baker's association with Sports Kids. 
</P>
<P>
Evans declined further comment, but possible areas of inquiry were believed to 
focus on the extent to which court officials knew of Baker's dealings with 
Sports Kids at the time his community service was up for review. 
</P>
<P>
In general, court officials say, people ordered to do community service are 
expected not to receive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Community service should involve "some sort of sacrifice" by the defendant, 
acting Presiding Superior Court Judge James Smith said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Speer, a spokesman for the Orange County Probation Department, said that 
when judges order community service, "there is no expectation of (the 
defendants') receiving compensation. . . . In fact, the individual should be 
compensating the community." 
</P>
<P>
During a review of Sports Kids records and conversations with officials and 
Meyer, a picture emerged of Baker's relationship with the group and of his 
expectations of future employment. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1987, Baker, as an Irvine City Councilman, helped persuade Sports Kids 
officials to locate the organization in Irvine. And he became an active booster 
and occasional fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
* Last November, just after beginning his community service work with the 
group, Baker and his father loaned Sports Kids $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
* While doing his community service at Sports Kids, Baker submitted a proposal 
under which he could have earned up to $120,000 in salary and a bonus of the 
same amount, and received a telephone-equipped luxury car and an expense 
account. 
</P>
<P>
In doing his community service work for the organization, Baker answered 
telephones, planned special events and developed a long-range business plan. 
Foster said Baker was given a car, as are all other Sports Kids executives. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Meyer acknowledged that Baker used the Cadillac, but said it was not 
his exclusively. And Meyer said Baker began full-time employment only after his 
community service term was over. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of the $80,000 Sports Kids now owes Baker, Foster said "we 
wanted to do the right thing. We will pay him (Baker) the amount . . . that we 
agreed to as soon as we find out that there is nothing illegal. . . . We want 
to honor the terms and the conditions of his community service and probation." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, a 36-year-old lawyer, last summer was the early favorite in the 
congressional race to replace retiring incumbent Rep. Robert E. Badham 
(R-Newport Beach). But in the closing days of the GOP primary, his campaign ran 
short of cash. Baker, then executive director of the Irvine Health Foundation, 
made out a $48,000 check from that organization to himself and signed it with 
the forged signature of another officer, Superior Court Judge David G. Sills. 
</P>
<P>
Baker stopped payment on the check shortly thereafter, and the forgery was not 
discovered until after the June primary election, which Baker narrowly lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney ultimately charged Baker with a felony 
count of forgery. Facing up to three years in prison if convicted, he pleaded 
guilty. But Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown reduced the charge to a 
misdemeanor and sentenced Baker to a one-year jail term -- which was suspended 
-- plus a year of probation, on the condition that he perform community service 
in line with prosecutor Evans' request that it be at least 500 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before Baker's sentencing on Nov. 14, he submitted proposals to 
Brown outlining his intention to complete the community service by coaching 
basketball at Warren High School in Downey, serving the elderly at Meals on 
Wheels in Irvine and assisting Sports Kids, an organization designed to 
encourage youngsters to participate in sports. In college, Baker had been a 
basketball star at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Kids work was confirmed in a Nov. 12 letter from former 
gold-medalist Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Baker as "a volunteer staff member" at Sports Kids, Mathias told the 
judge that "recently, Mr. Baker asked if he could take a more active role in 
the (organization) and offered to volunteer a substantial amount of time of a 
daily, even weekend basis. The offer also came with a humble request that he be 
allowed to maintain a 'low profile,' prefering to work in a behind-the-scene 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking into consideration the 'at least four months . . . ' length of Mr. 
Baker's time offering," Mathias continued, "our present legal and business 
development needs make this volunteer gesture extremely attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Mathias could not be reached for comment this week; Sports Kids said he was 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sports Kids memorandums and interviews with Foster, Baker appeared 
at the organization's door in late November to begin his community service 
work. At some point that month, Foster said Baker was given use of the 
Cadillac, which had been donated to Sports Kids by a local car dealer. Sports 
Kids also paid for Baker's gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Baker wrote a series of longhand memos discussing his personal 
goals, outlining his work progress and effectively proposing that he be given a 
permanent job. 
</P>
<P>
If placed in a full-time position, Baker wrote, he would need to drive a 
Cadillac or Chrysler LeBaron that would be equipped with a car telephone. He 
also sought an expense account that would cover staff and office supply costs, 
as well as pay $400 a month in phone charges. 
</P>
<P>
By Dec. 29, records show that Sports Kids agreed to employ Baker and pay him 
$120,000 annually, plus a potential bonus equal to his salary. Baker was also 
to get 5% of all funds he personally raised. He had sought -- but wasn't given 
-- a 25% share in ownership of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the verbal agreement were put in writing by Baker and dated Jan. 1, 
1989, records show. Although Foster said it is not a contract in the strict 
sense, he believes the "memorandum of understanding" constitutes a valid 
employment deal. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said Baker was not paid on a monthly basis because the money was not 
available. He said Sports Kids was in its "start-up phase," and it was agreed 
that Baker would be paid retroactive to Jan. 1 later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 6, defense attorney Meyer went to Judge Brown and said that Baker had 
completed a total of 550 hours of his required community service at the Downey 
high school, Meals on Wheels and Sports Kids. Meyer asked that the judge set 
aside the rest of Baker's one-year probation sentence, which Brown did, 
effective May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said this week that Baker had come to him in January and asked if he 
could work at Sports Kids after his community service was fulfilled, even 
though he was yet to complete the year of probation. 
</P>
<P>
"When Dave came to me about finding a job, I said, 'Yes, by all means.' " Meyer 
said. "There is no law against working for wages while you are on probation. If 
a person couldn't do that, this would be the biggest welfare society in 
history. Dave has a family, and he has needs just like anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer discounted the issue of Sports Kids providing Baker with a Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave was allowed the use of a car," Meyer said. "But it was my understanding 
that other people (at Sports Kids) used cars as well. . . . It was basically 
used for Sports Kids' business. I don't see it as a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer continued: "Just as with everything that Dave Baker has ever been 
involved with, he throws himself entirely into the activity. When the 
opportunity with Sports Kids came up, he talked to his family and decided that 
it was the right organization to go with. When they needed money, he decided he 
wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
It was also learned this week that last Nov. 28 Baker and his father made a 
personal loan of $20,000 to Sports Kids' parent company, Sports Properties 
International. This information was volunteered by Meyer, who questioned why 
Foster had discussed Baker's employment with Times reporters without mentioning 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said the loan was made at the request of Sports Kids officials. 
</P>
<P>
Baker received a promissory note signed by Foster, who also serves as chairman 
of Sports Properties, Meyer said. The note required the organization to repay 
the loan over a three-month period. Baker was to receive $5,000 in January, the 
same amount in February, and the balance, $10,000, was due at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was not made, Meyer emphasized, to gain special treatment from the 
group or reduce the number of community-service hours Baker planned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Foster told The Times that until Meyer mentioned the loan to a reporter, he had 
considered the matter to be private. Foster said it was Baker who had offered 
the loan, and had stressed in the document that it be kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Meyer said, Baker has not been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Foster acknowledged this week that Sports Kids currently lacks enough cash to 
pay all of what it owes Baker. But he said he expects the money to be available 
by August. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said that when Baker resigned from Sports Kids in April, it wasn't 
because of the unpaid loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave and I have always had discussions about when he was going to get a real 
job," Meyer said. "If Sports Kids provided real opportunities, fine. Dave was 
going to stick with it. But in the end, I think Dave concluded that it was 
basically a good-will organization and did not suit his long-range plans." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer declined to elaborate on what Baker is doing now: "At some point, an 
individual has the right to some privacy."

HIGHLIGHTS OF HOUSE S&amp;L BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1. $50 billion in bonds will be sold over three years, with the funds used to 
pay off depositors when ailing thrifts are closed. 
</P>
<P>
2. A new Resolution Trust Corp. will dismantle the financially crippled 
S&amp;Ls and dispose of $400 billion in repossessed real estate -- homes, 
apartments, shopping centers, office buildings and land -- owned by the failed 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
3. An S&amp;L's owners will be required to supply the institution with $1.50 in 
cash for every $100 in loans it makes, beginning in June, 1990. This capital 
standard rises to 3% in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
4. S&amp;L payments to the federal insurance fund will rise from $2.10 per 
$1,000 of deposits to $2.30. Bank premiums will climb from 8 cents per $1,000 
to 15 cents. 
</P>
<P>
5. The Justice Department will receive $75 million to investigate and prosecute 
fraud at financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
6. The home loan banks owned by the S&amp;L industry will supply $75 million a 
year to help subsidize housing for people with low or moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
7. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates banks, will become the 
new overseer of S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the package is estimated at $157 billion over 10 years. This 
includes the $50 billion in bonds for future S&amp;L shutdowns, the expenses 
associated with previous closings and the rebuilding of the federal insurance 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be paying interest for 30 years, and the final cost of the 
bailout is estimated at $275 billion to $300 billion. The taxpayers will 
furnish about 75% of the total cost, with the balance coming from premiums on 
the savings and loan industry. ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT

SPORTS KIDS' GOAL: CHARACTER THROUGH FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK and STEVEN R. CHURM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The goal of the nonprofit Sports Kids, its founders say, is to build character 
in children through sports and physical fitness. 
</P>
<P>
The four principals in the 18-month-old organization are Paul Stem, a former 
Delta Air Lines executive; Bob Mathias, a former Olympic decathlon champion who 
is the group's president; Chuck Foster, the executive director, and Larry 
Sayler. Each is paid $85,000 a year, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The group has an unpaid board of governors that includes celebrities such as 
Mike Love of the Beach Boys and Jermaine Jackson of the Jackson family. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mathias placed the organization's headquarters in Irvine rather than 
Indianapolis, in part at the urging of then-Irvine City Councilman C. David 
Baker. Officials say that Baker opened doors and introduced Sports Kids leaders 
to influential people in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The group, with offices in a suite on the 17th floor of the Irvine Marriott 
Hotel, says its goal is to build programs for children ages 5 and up, and to 
annually produce an international competition for boys and girls 10 to 13. The 
group's motto is: "Participation Is Victory." 
</P>
<P>
The group had its first major fund-raiser in April featuring singer Donny 
Osmond. The event at the Marriott drew nearly 800 people who paid $250 a plate. 
Foster said the organization cleared $30,000 after expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, its first international Earth Games were held on the campus of UC 
Irvine and drew 140 participants, including 14 from the Soviet Union and 16 
from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The second Earth Games, a 13-day event, will begin Aug. 13 at the Caliente Race 
Track in Tijuana, Mexico. About 500 children from 159 countries are expected to 
take part in games such as soccer, baseball and basketball. GEORGE FRANK and 
STEVEN R. CHURM

TASK FORCE TARGETS CON ARTISTS SELLING BOGUS AID TO ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials, concerned about unscrupulous "counselors" offering phony 
legal aid and other bogus help to immigrants, said Thursday that they have 
formed a task force to crack down on scam artists preying on people seeking 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Fraudulent immigration help is of particular concern locally, said Rusty 
Kennedy, director of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, because 
184,000 immigrants in the county have applied for permanent U.S. residency 
under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The Immigration Reform Act is wonderful," county Supervisor Roger R. Stanton 
said in a statement prepared for the county unit's first meeting today. 
"Unfortunately, it also becomes an opportunity for the unscrupulous to take 
advantage of this large population, which needs educational and legal 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exploitation Seen 
</P>
<P>
"Too frequently, instead of critical needed assistance, our newest residents 
are being exploited." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the unit will include representatives of the county district 
attorney's office, the state attorney general's office, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and local police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Bar Assn., the Orange County Human Relations Commission and 
various community groups will also participate, noted Barbara Brown, executive 
assistant to Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
In March, government officials issued a warning about men describing themselves 
as government officials going door to door in Latino neighborhoods of the 
county and offering guaranteed seats in nonexistent English and civics classes, 
which are required for permanent residency status, in exchange for deposits 
ranging from $10 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, residents in Anaheim, Stanton and Santa Ana were victimized by the 
scam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraudulent Counselors 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said there is also concern about fraudulent immigration counselors 
charging outrageous amounts of money to shepherd applications through the legal 
maze but never completing the work. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Olivia T. Ibarra, head of the immigration section of the Bar Assn., 
said: "There is a great shortage of agencies that provide low-cost legal 
services to the immigrant population." 
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result, many people are practicing law without licenses in the 
county, with people being charged too much, not getting the service paid for at 
all or having it performed incompetently, Ibarra said.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Thursday recovered an estimated $3,000 in 
camera gear and clothing that was reported stolen the previous night from an 
entourage traveling with 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano 
youth who is flying around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties also announced that they had arrested a local man in connection 
with the break-in and theft at the Frobisher Inn, where Tony and 15 members of 
his entourage are staying. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old man, who cannot be identified until conviction under Canadian 
law, is from nearby Lake Harbor but was arrested in this Arctic Circle village. 
Mounted Constable Jim Cook said the man had checked into a room across from 
where Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, had stowed most of the crew's gear. He was 
taken into custody without incident and will be held without bail pending trial 
on charges of break-in and entry. 
</P>
<P>
Because the man is a convicted criminal on probation for a previous break-in 
and theft, Cook said, he faces a possible prison term of three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Was Eating 
</P>
<P>
The property taken Wednesday night included camera gear belonging to both Gary 
Aliengena and Alexie Grinevich, a Soviet journalist accompanying the flight, 
Cook said. Some clothing belonging to Tony and his father was also removed from 
a bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in occurred while the Aliengena family and their entourage were 
eating dinner. Maxim Chikin, a fellow Soviet correspondent, discovered the 
theft when he returned from dinner to the ransacked room. 
</P>
<P>
"They have taken my stuff," Chikin said. 
</P>
<P>
Chikin and Grinevich later told the authorities that a man staying in a room 
across the hallway had watched them as they unloaded luggage into the room. The 
Soviets, who arrived here in a chase plane about an hour after Tony landed, 
identified the suspect in custody as the person they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
The theft was viewed as a major embarrassment in this wind-swept outpost of 
3,200 inhabitants, most of them native Inuits. To help soften the blow, the 
Mounted Police detachment here Thursday morning delivered a packet of souvenir 
stickers and pins for the entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the suspect was relatively easy to apprehend because Iqaluit is an 
island community, closed off to the world except for an airport that operates 
commercial flights only by day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Least We Can Do' 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a bunch of people traveling through here on good cause and it's the 
least we can do to try and help them out," Cook said of Tony's friendship 
mission around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's father assured the Canadians that there were no hard feelings. The 
Aliengena family rested in Iqaluit on Thursday, meeting students at the local 
school and taking joy rides around a frozen bay on a Hoverjet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a ball here," Aliengena said at an Iqaluit press conference Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's flight was scheduled to resume at 8:30 a.m. PDT today, with a 1,700-mile 
flight across the North Atlantic Ocean from Iqaluit to Reykjavik, Iceland. The 
flight is expected to last nine hours, not including a two-hour refueling stop 
in bGreenland. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Tony is scheduled to make European landfall at Oslo, Norway.

PETERS AND HELM SIGN MAJOR LEAGUE CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rex Peters of Cal State Fullerton and Wayne Helm of Pepperdine signed major 
league contracts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Helm, a former Laguna Hills High School pitcher, signed with the Angels and 
will report next week to the team's rookie camp at Mesa, Ariz. Peters, a senior 
first baseman, signed with the Dodgers and will report to their rookie team at 
Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Helm, a junior, was 6-5 with a 4.17 earned-run average and 102 strikeouts for 
Pepperdine University this season. He compiled a 10-7 record in two seasons at 
Pepperdine after transferring from the University of Arizona, where he pitched 
as a freshman. 
</P>

Less than 24 hours after receiving her diploma from El Dorado High School, 
Janet Evans conducted business as usual Thursday, the first day of the Mission 
Viejo International Meet of Champions at the Marguerite Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the first of eight events in which she is scheduled to compete, 
Evans was hardly challenged as she scored an easy victory in the women's 
800-meter freestyle with a time of 8 minutes 39.58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Bensimon, who lives in Santa Barbara, finished second in 8:55.58. 
Sarah Anderson of Riverside was third (9:00.93). 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who last year set her world record of 8:17.12, took an early lead and 
then pulled away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a workout swim for me," said Evans, who will attend Stanford in 
the fall. "I just tried to keep getting ahead of my competition and see how far 
along I am in my training. I was happy with the way I swam." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who will compete in the 400-meter individual medley and 200-meter 
butterfly in the Mission Viejo meet today, the 400-meter freestyle and 200 
backstroke on Saturday and the 200-meter individual medley, 200 breaststroke 
and 200 freestyle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her graduation experiences the night before, Evans said: "Picking 
up my high school diploma was a little different for me. It was a sad 
experience for me but I was also happy. I'm going to miss high school but I'm 
real excited about starting college at Stanford and I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 800-meter freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat survived a strong 
challenge from Mission Viejo teammate Mariusz Podkoscielny to win in 8:08.62. 
</P>
<P>
Podkoscielny, who stayed with Wojdat until the final 200 meters, was second in 
8:10.79. U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen came in third in 8:14.86. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to go about 8:10, so I was happy with my time," Wojdat said. "I'm 
right now where I expected to be when the season started." 
</P>
<P>
Said Podkoscielny: "I'm happy with what I did. I led at the halfway point, but 
I didn't lead by enough, and he won the race with his speed at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat and Podkoscielny, who competed for Poland during the 1988 Olympics, and 
Jorgensen, were among four Olympians in the men's event. Lars Jorgensen, Dan's 
brother and 1988 U.S. team member, finished fourth in 8:19.70.

MILKEN RESIGNS DREXEL POST, WILL OPEN SOUTHLAND CONSULTING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"Junk bond" wizard Michael Milken officially ended his 20-year career at Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday and said he will launch his own financial 
consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 42, who has been on a leave of absence from Drexel since March 29, on 
Thursday submitted his resignation. In a telephone interview, he said his new 
firm, International Capital Access Group, would offer a wide range of 
consulting services consistent with his personal interests and his previous 
work at Drexel. He claimed that one purpose of the firm will be to "address the 
major issues in society." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would offer advice on subjects as diverse as the Third World debt 
crisis, helping unions, employees and minorities obtain ownership stakes in 
companies and advising financially troubled companies on how to raise new 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Emotional Experience' 
</P>
<P>
The timing of Milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a Supreme 
Court decision last week that cleared the way for Drexel to complete its 
announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges 
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement now is 
expected to go into effect within the next few weeks. It requires Drexel to 
terminate Milken's employment and also avoid any direct or indirect business 
dealings with him. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, 39, also resigned Thursday from Drexel. He 
said through his attorney that he plans to resume practicing law. Lowell Milken 
had been a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Irell &amp; Manella before he 
left in 1978 to help his brother run Drexel's junk bond department. Michael 
Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client hasn't decided yet where he 
will practice. Lowell Milken was also indicted in March on racketeering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the 
resignation: "After spending your whole life working for one company, it's a 
very emotional experience." But in a reference to the investigation and legal 
problems that have beset him, he added, "the last few years have been an 
emotional experience." 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he decided to set up his own firm now because "to continue to help 
(people he has done business with or offered advice to), I need some vehicle to 
be able to help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Naturally Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at Drexel Harriman, a 
Philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
while attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. 
Within a decade, his pioneering use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds had 
transformed Drexel from a second-tier brokerage firm into one of Wall Street's 
most powerful investment banking houses. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued Thursday, Milken said: 
</P>
<P>
"Drexel is the only company I've worked for since graduating from college. And 
it's the only one I ever expected to work for. I am naturally disappointed to 
be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, 
but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies." 
</P>
<P>
Milken currently faces a 98-count federal criminal indictment. The government 
is also demanding that he forfeit $1.85 billion under the racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said: "Michael Milken made many important 
contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, 
is a sad event." He added: "We wish him well in his new endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
Milken was somewhat vague about exactly what the new firm will do or how many 
people it will employ. His personal spokesman, Ken Lerer, said it would start 
out with fewer than 10 employees. Tentative plans call for it to be based in 
West Los Angeles, and Lerer said it definitely won't be in the Beverly Hills 
building that houses Drexel's junk bond department. Milken, his brother and 
several other partners own that building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined to Speculate 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he isn't currently talking with any of his former colleagues at 
Drexel about coming to work for his new firm, but he didn't rule out that 
possibility. "I just can't tell you at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to speculate on whether he might try to expand the firm to 
offer full-scale investment banking services if he should succeed in overcoming 
the criminal and civil charges facing him. "The financial world changes all the 
time," he said. "Exactly what one would be interested in doing in the future I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent him from 
competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said. 
Were he to branch out beyond consulting to underwriting or trading securities, 
he might run afoul of federal and state regulators who supervise the 
registration of securities broker-dealers. But sources said the potential 
exists nevertheless for conflicts with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly 
with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel can't do business with 
clients advised by Milken. Milken's lawyers haven't said yet whether they will 
challenge that provision of the settlement in court. If it goes into effect, 
however, it conceivably could force clients to choose between dealing with 
Milken or Drexel. A source close to Milken said: "I think you'd have to take it 
on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Anreder said: "We don't anticipate any conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Milken also declined to say if he might refer clients to firms other than 
Drexel for investment banking services. "I can't predict what's going to happen 
in the future," he said. "We'll see what happens and it will depend on each 
individual situation." 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who earned amounts ranging up to $550 million per year at Drexel, over 
the last year has attempted to help arrange financing for unions and workers 
seeking to take over troubled companies. He also has proposed innovative 
solutions to the Latin American debt problem. Some observers have viewed this 
as part of an overall public relations campaign at a time when he is in 
trouble. But Lerer insists that these are all genuine interests of Milken's and 
that he has been involved in these activities for years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Demands Than Ever' 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new 
firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, he has had an 
unaccustomed amount of time on his hands. They note that Milken typically would 
work from 4:30 a.m. until about 6 p.m. He was used to orchestrating a multitude 
of deals at once. In recent weeks, Milken has given speeches to a variety of 
organizations and worked on his legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Michael is desperate to find something to do," a former Drexel 
colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken himself, however, strongly denied that he has time on his hands. "I have 
more demands on my time than ever before," he said, although he added, 
referring to the legal cases: "Sometimes they're things you'd rather not have 
to spend time on." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, declined to comment Thursday on 
Milken's decision to open a new business. The Milken brothers still face SEC 
civil charges as well as the separate criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, his brother and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg are likely to go 
to trial on the pending criminal charges sometime early next year. Federal 
prosecutors are expected to bring a new indictment within the next several 
months containing additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted 
immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government 
investigation. Sources confirmed Thursday that another former Drexel employee, 
Reed Harmon, who had worked closely with Milken, was recently granted immunity 
in exchange for testimony before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Denied 
</P>
<P>
Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings 
with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Boesky, suspected of widespread 
insider trading, pleaded guilty to one criminal count and agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors. Much of the government's case against Milken involves his 
alleged dealings with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, Lowell Milken and Newberg all vigorously deny the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal charges and pay $650 million 
in penalties under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. 
The guilty plea would be made after the firm's separate settlement with the SEC 
goes into effect. Lawyers for Michael and Lowell Milken are challenging 
provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that Drexel 
withhold much of the brothers' compensation owed them for 1988. Michael Milken 
is said to be owed at least $200 million.

GERBER TO LAUNCH INFANT FORMULA IN AD CAMPAIGN AIMED AT PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baby foods maker Gerber Products said Thursday that it has teamed up with the 
pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers to introduce an infant formula that will be 
advertised directly to parents -- a controversial strategy opposed by a 
pediatricians' group. 
</P>
<P>
Most infant formulas are advertised only to medical professionals under 
guidelines approved by advocates of breast-feeding and the powerful American 
Academy of Pediatrics, which on Thursday voiced its opposition to the Gerber 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The groups say that advertising directly to mothers may discourage 
breast-feeding, and last year, the academy and others opposed a similar 
marketing method that Los Angeles-based Carnation Co. used to market a new 
formula product. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Birt Harvey, the academy's president-elect, said a mother's decision to 
breast- or bottle-feed "shouldn't be influenced by commercial advertising by 
one product or another. You are dealing with babies, not with soap products or 
automobiles." Medical professionals say that breast milk is the most healthful 
food for infants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stand-Off With Doctors 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect them to change their position," said Steven W. Poole, 
spokesman for Gerber, whose representatives met with officials of the 
pediatricians' group to review the product and the marketing strategy. "The 
academy's position, we believe, doesn't give consumer-mothers enough credit 
about being well informed about breast-feeding." 
</P>
<P>
Television and print advertising for the Gerber formula, which is to be 
available nationwide in October, will "emphasize that breast-feeding should be 
the first choice for mothers," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber says direct advertising for its product is needed if it is to make 
inroads into the highly competitive infant formula market. Gerber made its own 
formula in the 1950s and 1960s, before abandoning the business to the 
pharmaceutical companies, which now claim most of the $1.5 billion in annual 
formula sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Gerber product will be made by Bristol-Myers, which makes infant formulas 
Enfamil and ProSobee. In the 1970s, Bristol-Myers was forced to stop 
advertising its formulas in baby-care magazines, under pressure from the 
pediatricians' organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Milk-Based Recipe 
</P>
<P>
The new Gerber product is actually a milk-based formula that Bristol-Myers 
manufactured until 1983, when it switched to a whey-based mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol-Myers also will promote the Gerber formula through its sales personnel 
who call on doctors, said Poole. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership between the two firms surprised some industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"From Gerber's standpoint, it's a lower-risk way to play it," John M. McMillin, 
a food industry analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, said. "But what happens 
if it starts to cannibalize (Bristol-Myers') existing business?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to increase total market share through this venture," said David 
Dubber of Bristol-Myers, which claims about 35% of the market. "Today, more 
consumers are taking a more active role in forming a selection and the Gerber 
infant formulas will react to that decision." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Their Method' 
</P>
<P>
Dubber said that Bristol-Myers has no plan to begin advertising its own infant 
formula products directly to consumers. "It's just their method of marketing 
and distribution," Dubber said of Gerber's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leader Abbott Laboratories, which makes Similac, said it will continue 
to refrain from direct advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation Co., also under pressure from the Academy, dropped its name and that 
of its Good Start and Good Nature products from its infant product advertising.

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IMPROVES IN SIGN OF COOLING ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. foreign trade deficit shrank to $8.3 billion in April, the Commerce 
Department reported Thursday, marking renewed improvement in the nation's trade 
picture following several months in which the deficit had seemed stuck on a 
plateau. 
</P>
<P>
The narrowing, from a revised $9.5-billion red-ink figure in March, reflected a 
slowdown in the domestic economy, which has dampened import buying by 
consumers. Imports fell $1.03 billion, or 2.6%, in April. Exports rose a 
respectable $249.2 million, or 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipation of improvement in April sent the dollar soaring on the foreign 
exchange markets, but the value of the U.S. currency declined once the figures 
were announced as traders sought to capitalize on the gain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dollar rallied in Tokyo, ending up a full 3.5 yen higher than the 
previous day, it finished mostly lower in European trading. Central banks of 
both the United States and other industrial countries continued to intervene in 
an effort to stem the dollar's rise. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Bush Administration and most private analysts hailed the new trade 
figures as encouraging -- particularly after a six-month hiatus during which 
the overall deficit failed to show any improvement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Encouraging' 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said the April report provided "some 
further evidence of the gradual reduction of the deficit." And Sara Johnson, 
economist with DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Cambridge, 
Mass., called the figures "very encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson predicted that the overall U.S. trade deficit would fall to $111 
billion by the end of this year, down from $119.8 billion in 1988. The gap had 
grown to $152.1 billion in 1987 before finally beginning to shrink, partly as a 
result of a sharply lower dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The improved outlook came as a relief to economists. Only a few months ago, 
analysts had feared that the domestic economy might be overheating -- a 
development they warned could lead to a continuation of the nation's 
import-buying spree and an end to the improvement in trade. 
</P>
<P>
But that danger appears to have passed. Import buying has slowed, and U.S. 
demand has weakened somewhat, easing pressure on U.S. manufacturing industries, 
many of which had reached the limits of their production capacity earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
New figures published by the Federal Reserve Board on Thursday buttressed that 
view. They showed that industrial production in the United States remained 
unchanged in May, following a revised 0.6% rise the previous month, providing 
further evidence that the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Old-Fashioned Way' 
</P>
<P>
The Fed also reported that manufacturing industries in the United States used 
only 83.8% of their available production capacity in May, down from 84.1% in 
April. Both figures were influenced heavily by a slump in the U.S. auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
William C. Melton, chief economist for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis, 
said the trade figures showed that America is "reducing its trade deficit the 
old-fashioned way -- by leaning on consumers" through higher interest rates and 
tight money and credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Japan's trade surplus with the United States has begun to 
shrink markedly, in part because Tokyo is buying more U.S. manufactured goods. 
Thursday's figures showed that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan fell to $3.89 
billion in April, from $4.22 billion in March. 
</P>
<P>
DRI/McGraw Hill's Johnson speculated that at least part of the improvement in 
April may have stemmed from perverse effects of the recent rise in the dollar, 
which has recovered about a third of the ground that it lost between 1985 and 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although a rising dollar makes imports less expensive -- eventually spurring 
more import buying -- in the short run the lower prices for imports make the 
deficit seem smaller. As a result, Johnson predicted, the trade figure now may 
continue to improve through early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the April falloff in import buying came in automobiles, 
where weak domestic demand -- combined with the transfer of more production of 
Japanese cars to assembly plants in the United States -- slashed sales of 
imports here. 
</P>
<P>
Oil imports, another major contributor to the monthly trade deficit, rose by 
$398.1 million in April to a new level of $4.1 billion, partly as a result of 
higher prices for petroleum products.

Broker Barred: The Securities and Exchange Commission has barred a Cincinnati 
stockbroker from the securities business but said he could be reinstated if he 
gets a clean bill of health from a psychiatrist. The broker, P. David 
Herrlinger, caused an uproar on Wall Street in 1987 when he called Dow Jones 
News Service and announced a bogus $6.8-billion offer to buy Minneapolis-based 
Dayton Hudson Corp., one of the nation's biggest retailers. Speculators 
responding to the Dow Jones report of the purported $70-a-share bid sent the 
price of Dayton Hudson stock soaring by as much as $9 a share in heavy trading. 
The price later tumbled after Herrlinger's attorney reported the offer was a 
hoax.

$85-MILLION DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
COLECO OKS HASBRO BUYOUT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Coleco Industries agreed Thursday to be bought by Hasbro Inc. for $85 million, 
marking the likely end of the company that made the hottest-selling toy in U.S. 
history, the Cabbage Patch Kids doll. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro, the largest American toy maker, will receive all of Coleco's product 
line, which includes Scrabble and Parcheesi board games, as part of the 
all-cash deal, Coleco Chairman Morton Handel said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal still must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, where 
Coleco, swamped with $540.3 million in debt, sought protection from creditors a 
year ago. A hearing on the sale is expected next week or in early July, Handel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco is to receive warrants to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro stock as 
part of the deal. Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., will get inventory, 
equipment to make products and some accounts receivable. 
</P>
<P>
Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and Coleco directors 
also must approve the deal, which must be completed by July 17. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's 250 employees are expected to be laid 
off, although some may be hired by Hasbro, Handel said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco has about 75 salaried workers in Avon, Conn., 75 in Mayfield, N.Y., and 
a total of about 100 assembly-line workers at both locations. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take risks," said Paul 
Valentine, a toy analyst with Standard &amp; Poors in New York. "The industry 
is poorer because of their demise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good, Stable Games' 
</P>
<P>
Russian immigrant Maurice Greenberg founded the Connecticut Leather Co. in 
1932. The firm company expanded its leather and shoe products line to toys in 
1954 and its name was changed to Coleco in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Coleco ran into trouble after the phenomenal success of the 
Cabbage Patch doll, which became the best-selling toy of all time with more 
than $600 million in sales in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
David Leibowitz, senior vice president of American Securities Corp., said 
Coleco borrowed money to expand after the success of the Cabbage Patch dolls. 
</P>
<P>
But when Cabbage Patch Kids sales tumbled and new products, including Adams 
home computer and toys based on the Rambo movies, did not sell, Coleco couldn't 
pay off the new debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and Transformers, 
had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from $104.3 million in 1980. Hasbro in 
the last decade has bought big-name companies, including Milton Bradley Co., 
and introduced a steady stream of new products. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro Executive Vice President Barry Alperin said of the Coleco deal: "It 
means the acquisition of good, stable game products, like Scrabble, Parcheesi 
and Aggravation . . . and it's a good chance to add to our toy division." 
</P>
<P>
After the transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million in cash, $85 
million from Hasbro and about $65 million it had in banks in mid-March, Handel 
said. The cash will be used to pay off the company's debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleco also said it would retain some real estate assets, which will be 
converted to cash.

TIME, WARNER BOARDS QUIET ON STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Directors of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. apparently met separately 
Thursday to thrash out plans to salvage their merger, but by nightfall, neither 
company had tipped its hand about the next move. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of the meetings -- on the ninth day after Paramount Communications made 
its surprise $10.7-billion cash bid for Time -- provoked long debates on Wall 
Street about whether Time and Warner can find an expedient solution together, 
or whether the two companies will ultimately go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis stepped up the pressure on Time's 
12 directors with a letter reminding them that Paramount is prepared to sweeten 
its offer. Davis asked for a meeting and said Paramount would "be prepared to 
review any non-public information which you believe could justify a higher 
price." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Time nor Warner would confirm that its directors had been summoned, but 
several out-of-town members of each board were in Manhattan on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Help Finance' 
</P>
<P>
Although Time has not responded formally to the offer, the media giant has 
demonstrated its anger over the unsolicited Paramount bid, which has almost 
certainly derailed the non-cash stock swap with Warner that was to be put to a 
shareholder vote next week. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street sources reiterated their belief that Time has encouraged investment 
bankers to search for prospective buyers of Paramount itself. One investment 
banker said Time is believed to have offered to "help finance the bid" if a 
buyer for Paramount can be found. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.8 million Paramount shares changed hands Thursday on the New York 
Stock Exchange, although the closing price of $59.50 was unchanged from 
Wednesday's close. Warner's stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $55.625, while 
the price of Time shares fell $3.625 to $171.50, below the $175-per-share offer 
made by Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Warner and Time announced that the City of New York 
has cleared the way for the transfer of Time's and Warner's six cable 
franchises in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens to the new company 
if the merger takes place. The cable systems serve nearly 9% of the 5.5 million 
subscribers in the combined Time and Warner cable systems. Some analysts are 
betting that Time and Warner will still try to merge but will change the terms 
of the deal and offer a handsome dividend to shareholders. One analyst said he 
believes that Time is prepared to take on massive debt to complete the merger 
if necessary, while Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, 
said he believes the merger is "financeable" if the original stock-swap ratio 
is changed in favor of Time shareholders and a cash dividend of as much as $125 
is paid. The combination would result in a package comparable to Paramount's 
offer to Time shareholders, Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
But other traders interpreted the declining price of Time shares and the 
increase in Warner's as a clear sign that more investors had come to expect a 
Time tender offer for part or all of Warner. 
</P>
<P>
One stock speculator said Time advisers Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. have a 
reputation for hard-line defenses, and might urge rejection of the Paramount 
bid or even a cash dividend to Time shareholders.

Valley Federal Stock Soars: The stock of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan in 
Van Nuys surged 16% on heavy volume, but the struggling thrift said it could 
not account for the activity. The stock jumped $1.50 a share, to $11, on volume 
of 298,200 shares in over-the-counter trading. Glendale-based Citadel Holding 
has been mulling a takeover bid for Valley but Valley said it had no 
announcements about Citadel or any other potential suitor. Citadel also said it 
was not buying Valley shares.

PEOPLE: SUN'S GRAZIANO JOINS RIVAL APPLE COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph A. Graziano has resigned as vice president of finance and chief 
financial officer at Sun Microsystems Inc. to join rival Apple Computer Inc. in 
a similar position. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second tour of duty at Apple for the 45-year-old Graziano, who 
served as the company's chief financial officer from October, 1981, to May, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano is the second high-ranking executive to leave Sun this spring. In 
April, executive vice president Bernard Lacroute abruptly resigned. No reasons 
were offered and Lacroute has not taken another post. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano's switch was not viewed with great alarm by analysts in Silicon 
Valley, where job hopping among high tech companies is a fact of life. Over the 
past year alone, Sun has gained two product marketing managers from Apple, 
including Chuck Berger, now Sun's vice president for product marketing. Apple 
hired away Jim Davis, Sun's former director of software product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Graziano succeeds Deborah A. Coleman, who took a medical leave of absence from 
Apple late last year. At the time, Coleman said she wanted to lose the weight 
she had gained while in the CFO position and assume a less demanding role in 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
A Sun insider said it was well known within the high tech community in Silicon 
Valley that Coleman's post was vacant, and Graziano had been weighing for a 
while whether to return to the post. Because Apple's revenue is about four 
times higher than Sun's, the shift was widely viewed as a career-enhancing move 
for Graziano. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Raduchel, vice president of corporate planning and development, has 
been named acting chief financial officer at Sun. CARLA LAZZARESCHI

DOW FALLS 28.36 AS BOND, DOLLAR MARKETS WANE

<P>
Stock prices took a pounding Thursday, hit by futures-related selling programs 
and plunges in bond prices and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials tumbled 28.36 to 2,475.00. 
</P>
<P>
Losers swamped gainers in nationwide trading of shares listed on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 1,078 issues declining, 444 rising and 466 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 179.48 million shares, up from 
170.54 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks were sold in preparation for the so-called triple witching hour, which 
occurs once each quarter when stock-index futures, index options and options on 
individual stocks expire. Trading volume was expected to be heavy today as 
investors adjust their positions in stocks and futures. 
</P>
<P>
A setback in the credit market acted as a catalyst to the stock selling. The 
30-year Treasury bond rate dropped about 1 1/2 points, or $15 for every $1,000 
in value. The bond's decline coincided with a steep slide in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders previously had been buying out of optimism that the dollar's 
recent strength would attract foreign investments. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said the market 
declines were unsurprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we just got a case of tired blood," he said. "The bond market, the 
stock market and the dollar have all moved to excess." 
</P>
<P>
Integrated Resources Inc. shares plunged nearly 50%, to a closing price of 
$6.25, after the insurance and mutual funds company said it was stopping 
payment on $864 million in short-term debt. Integrated, which has $7.8 billion 
in assets, said that its affiliates and subsidiaries would continue paying 
creditors. Banks on Wednesday withdrew Integrated's access to short-term credit 
markets. About 1.7 millions shares of Integrated were traded Thursday on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the London Stock Exchange finished mostly lower Thursday on the 
back of early losses on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share index lost 
4.0 points to close at 2,129.6. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dropped in hectic trading, dragged down by the tumbling dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled about 1 1/2 points, or $15 
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction from price, soared to 8.30% from 8.16% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for short-term 
loans, was quoted late in the day at 9.438%, down from 9.50% late Wednesday.

DOLLAR SUFFERS STEEPEST ONE-DAY FALL IN YEARS

<P>
The dollar plummeted Thursday in what analysts called the steepest one-day 
decline in years, as traders who had been powering the currency's long rally 
suffered a sudden crisis of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said there was no apparent news to account for the dollar's 
drop, which amounted to 2.5% or more against the British pound, West German 
mark and Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, traders said the dollar appeared to have risen too far, too fast in 
recent weeks and may have been ripe for a sell-off on the part of speculators 
anxious to cash in their gains. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just inevitable we would reach some level where there were just no more 
buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage," said Bob Giordano, chief 
dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a market rally often breaks just when market sentiment that the 
advance is unstoppable is strongest, because there is no one left to persuade 
and therefore no more fresh cash available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Report Cited 
</P>
<P>
The dollar sank 4 yen to about 145 Japanese yen and 5 pfennigs to about 1.98 
West German marks. The value of a British pound rose 4 cents to $1.55. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Robertson, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, said the dollar's 
single-day fall was one of the biggest he has seen since he began trading 
currencies in 1980. Dealers said they could not recall the date of the last big 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
Grasping for explanations, some traders cited a Japanese news report that 
quoted unidentified sources as saying the Bank of Japan would continue to sell 
more than $1 billion a day in the open market, if necessary, to restrain the 
dollar's recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
Weakness in the U.S. bond market also hurt the dollar, traders said. Bonds fell 
after the government issued a report on May industrial production that showed 
more economic strength than expected, raising concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that the Federal Reserve and other central banks were helping 
to knock the dollar down. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's report that the merchandise trade deficit fell to 
$8.26 billion in April initially drove the dollar higher. Shortly after the 
trade figures were announced the dollar touched 2.0475 West German marks and 
151.85 yen. The British pound fell to $1.4940 before the reversal began. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before the business day begins in Europe, the 
dollar rose 3.25 yen to 151.30 yen, its highest level since August, 1987. Later 
in London, the dollar fell to 149.60 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 
145.40 yen from 149.45 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Metals Higher 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5195 from $1.5143 late Wednesday. In 
New York, sterling rose to $1.5510 from $1.5120 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday's rates: 1.9845 
West German marks, down from 2.0374; 1.7095 Swiss francs, down from 1.7555; 
1.1966 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2001; 6.7390 French francs, down from 
6.8945, and 1,443 Italian lire, down from 1,470. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Wednesday's rates: 2.0235 
West German marks, down from 2.0290; 1.7490 Swiss francs, down from 1.7525; 
6.8680 French francs, down from 6.8690; 2.2915 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2805; 
1,472.00 Italian lire, up from 1,464.50, and 1.1993 Canadian dollars, 
unchanged.

Newport Pacific Development Corp., Newport Beach, said it received final 
approval to start a $61-million redevelopment project in downtown Stanton, 
which includes a new City Hall under a somewhat unusual agreement with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The city will use the profits from sale of the land for the first phase of the 
project -- a $19-million, 335-unit residential community for the aged -- to pay 
for building a new City Hall within two years. 
</P>
<P>
The third phase of the 22-acre project calls for building a retail center. 
Stanton Mayor Edward L. Allen said the project would help give the city a "new 
image."

 Centennial Group Inc., an Orange developer and home builder, said it recently 
sold about $6.6 million worth of real estate. Analysts and observers said the 
public company may be selling property faster than it would like to dress up 
its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its Centennial Estates Inc. unit sold 329 residential lots in 
Lancaster for $5.9 million to Griffin Homes, for a profit of about $1.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sold 1.6 acres on Business Center Drive in San Bernardino to 
Robert and Barbara Henley for $689,000 and said it expects a profit of about 
$475,000 on the land, which the company bought in 1979.

SKATEBOARD CHAMPION JESSE ROACH'S STAR IS SOARING TO NEW COMMERCIAL HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jesse Roach handles his new-found celebrity with aplomb. Take, for instance, a 
recent day on Santa Catalina Island. All around him things were hectic. The 
activity was furious as cameramen scurried into place and NBC's "Today" show 
wound up its taping on location. 
</P>
<P>
Between segments, anchors Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley quick-stepped along the 
Avalon pier to the chalk marks showing where they must stand when the camera 
returns after a brief word from their sponsor. Hundreds of vacationing 
onlookers gawked and strained for a view. The clatter and noise escalated, then 
suddenly hushed as cameras returned to the action. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all this, waiting for his cue, champion skateboarder Jesse Roach yawned. 
</P>
<P>
Why shouldn't he yawn? Jesse is 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
On this day he shared the camera's attention with a pair of network anchor 
people and some of sports' biggest names -- Magic Johnson and Orel Hershiser -- 
to say nothing of everyone's favorite weatherman, Willard Scott. Even among 
such notables, the unflappable Jesse Roach's star was on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
He has made dozens of public appearances with traveling exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
He just finished filming a TV commercial for Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
He will be on the July cover of Sports Illustrated for Kids, the national 
sports publication's new monthly magazine for ages 8 and up. 
</P>
<P>
And he just may be the best 11-year-old skateboarder in the country. 
</P>
<P>
So wasn't Jesse Roach the least bit nervous as the "Today" show crew prepared 
to tape a skateboarding segment? 
</P>
<P>
"Me? Noooo," said the grinning Laguna Beach fourth-grader, a tassel of yellow 
hair protruding from his crash helmet. After a little prodding, Jesse allowed 
that "it's pretty cool" to appear on national television before millions of 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"Skating's helped me a lot in everything," he said. "It makes me work harder. 
It makes things seem more important." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Rosecrans, who with her husband, Everett, organized a "Pee Wee" 
skateboard team of pre-teens for Vans, a shoe manufacturer based in Orange, 
describes Jesse as "an extraordinary young man and an extraordinary skater." 
</P>
<P>
In the parlance of the skateboard world, Jesse gets "big air," meaning he soars 
very high above the ramp when performing. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse spends virtually all his free time practicing, which is one reason he has 
mastered tricks such as the "hand plant" in which he skates into the air at the 
top of the ramp and grabs its lip with his hand before his board returns to the 
wood for the ride down. He also performs what he calls "a front side 360" in 
which he comes down the ramp backward. Jesse has dubbed it "The Roach Twist." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse was the No. 1 rated amateur vertical ramp skater in California for youths 
12 years old and younger last year by virtue of winning a statewide contest. 
Now he has moved up to "the grown-ups," as he puts it. He competes against 
teen-agers and young adults, with hopes of someday making a career of 
skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
Some, including sponsors who have provided equipment, believe Jesse can succeed 
in competitive skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
James La Fave, 27, Jesse's first sponsor at Galaxy Sports, a Laguna Beach skate 
shop, recalls that the youth's parents stood behind him, transporting him to 
practice sessions and competitions. 
</P>
<P>
The determination Jesse has developed for skateboarding has helped him focus 
his life in other areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
"His grades went from Ds to Bs and A's when he got an interest," La Fave said. 
</P>
<P>
Being featured on television and in news stories has boosted his self-image, 
Jesse agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Or in his words: "I feel kind of better, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Roach is a boy of few words but much motion. 
</P>
<P>
In Catalina, he scrambled on cue onto a portable ramp to perform his patented 
swooping and leaping, defying gravity with the self-assuredness of a veteran 
risk-taker. 
</P>
<P>
"He just lives to skate," said Jackie Rosecranz of Vans. As a Vans team member, 
Jesse trains on specially constructed ramps at the shoe manufacturer's factory, 
travels to demonstrations and is supplied shoes and gear. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Peralta, 31, a world champion skateboarder when he was a teen-ager, was 
impressed by Jesse's credentials and recently added him to his touring team of 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Peralta, a principal in Powell Peralta, a Santa Barbara-based skateboard 
manufacturing firm, has 35 sponsored amateurs and professionals. They have been 
around the world three times, have skateboard models named after them and 
regularly appear in movies, videos and TV commercials. Jesse is the youngest 
team member by two years. He doesn't have a model named after him yet, but he 
has become a "factory team rider" for Powell Peralta. 
</P>
<P>
That means he's in "the highest division before pro," Jesse's father, Jerry 
Roach, said. "He's too young to turn pro." 
</P>
<P>
Powell Peralta's promotions coordinator, who goes only by the name Sasha, said: 
"We've got some young ones, but I think 11 is about our youngest sponsored 
amateur." 
</P>
<P>
"I usually do not sponsor kids below the age of 13," said Peralta, the firm's 
vice president. "There are mental demands this puts on a kid. It can affect 
them in a negative way by too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It can really tweak a kid's health. The opportunities are one thing. But 
mental health is really most important." 
</P>
<P>
However, Peralta was impressed by the support of Jesse's parents. "We'd like to 
work with him for 10 or 15 years . . . to build a career with him." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "you can see it in some kids. They simply have it." 
</P>
<P>
Following the "Today" show taping (the show has already aired), Jesse sat for 
promotional photos with Gumbel and Pauley, and they inspected his nicked and 
scraped knees and shins. His "scars" relegated him to a supporting role rather 
than being the principal skater in the recent Gatorade commercial, Jesse said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Roach said his son has never been seriously hurt skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife (Joan) is convinced he is going to walk through life unscathed," Roach 
said. "I like to think that too." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Roach said she used to "scream, shriek and cry out" when her son 
performed. But no more since he has been using protective gear such as hip 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst injuries that are going to happen are a broken shoulder, a broken 
wrist, a broken arm, maybe some ankles," said Roach, a real estate salesman. 
"But I haven't heard of anybody being disabled by ramp skating. 
</P>
<P>
"My son's been hurt more playing baseball," he said, recalling the time Jesse 
caught a hard throw on his forehead instead of his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I worry about him is when he's skating around the house. That 
(street) asphalt is unforgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jesse got serious about (skateboarding) when we got a ramp put in our 
back yard about three years ago. It was 6 feet high and about 25 feet long and 
12 feet wide. It cost about $1,000 and three months of labor." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse's older brother, Cory, now 18, built the ramp when he was a high school 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Roach said he believes having the ramp has not only prevented serious 
injury -- "when they fall, they slide" -- but sharpened the skills of the three 
Roach boys, Cory, Jesse and 8-year-old John. All are good skateboarders. 
</P>
<P>
However, a neighbor complained about the makeshift back-yard ramp, and the city 
of Laguna Beach said it had to be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
"It required a variance," Roach said. "It was too close to the house by 2 feet. 
They were afraid if they gave me a variance and anybody ever got hurt on it 
they'd be liable. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the ramp got closed down a neighbor kid broke his wrist skating in 
the street. They don't wear (protective) equipment in the street. He was over 
here every day and never was injured." 
</P>
<P>
Like most 11-year-olds, Jesse enjoys other pastimes. He plays tennis and likes 
to play catch. Still, nothing compares to his devotion to skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really motivated to go skate," Roach said. "From what they tell us, he is 
the best vertical ramp skater for his age in the world." 
</P>
<P>
A vertical ramp is like a large pipe cut in cross section, allowing 
skateboarders to soar up one curved side, skate back down and then roll up the 
opposite curve to repeat the process. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse won the only vertical ramp contest he entered last year by a large margin 
competing with youngsters in his age group from throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The sponsors and the pros say there is nobody his age who can do what he 
does," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Garner, a spokeswoman for the California Amateur Skateboard League, which 
sanctions skateboard competitions, noted that Jesse's excellence has not gone 
to his head. He willingly gives tips to younger kids, she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year Jesse entered his first competition "with the grown-ups and he 
finished about in the middle of the pack," his father said. Jesse was pitted 
against sponsored amateurs, generally five to 10 years older. 
</P>
<P>
By age 15, Jesse expects to be competing as a professional skater, some of whom 
make as much as $15,000 a month, Jerry Roach said. However, Jesse's mother 
concedes, only a very few who have turned professional are able to support 
themselves through skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's new that the little kids are starting to skate" competitively, said 
Jackie Rosecranz of Vans. "It's only happened in the last year." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Jesse was the fourth of four Pee Wee skateboarders to roar 
one at a time up and down Vans' portable ramp in the 95-second spot that closed 
the "Today" show in Catalina. The trouble was, the first three skaters took up 
97 seconds, and by the time Jesse climbed up to replace his younger brother, 
the taping was over. 
</P>
<P>
The next day Jesse was back on the training ramps at the Vans factory in 
Orange, skating up to and then soaring above the lip, reversing direction and 
slashing back down at high speed. He also broke new ground, but not his neck, 
when he inadvertently soared too high above the ramp, lost his board and did an 
accidental somersault in the air before crashing uninjured to the bottom. "I 
was kind of scared," Jesse said later. "I made a mistake."

GTS will get you the kind of respect you deserve. If you must be practical, 
$149.99 will allow you to roll in at the wheel of a BMW convertible. 
</P>

Several Orange County car rental companies are now renting luxury cars by the 
day, along with the standard Fords and Pontiacs. Avon Rent-A-Car of Newport 
Beach rents Rolls-Royces for $349 a day, plus 95 cents a mile, and Porsches for 
$259 a day, plus 75 cents a mile. The company also has Mercedes-Benzes, 
Ferraris and a Shelby Cobra. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise Rent-A-Car offers Cadillacs and Volvo 740s, and Executive Rent-A-Car 
has BMWs and Cadillacs. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the largest local collection of what the industry calls exotic cars 
is available through Budget Rent-A-Car at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach, 
which three weeks ago began trading luxury cars with Budget Rent-A-Car of 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Among the fancy wheels are: Ferrari Testarossa, Bentley Eight, Cadillac, Jaguar 
XJ6, Lotus Esprit Turbo, BMW, Rolls-Royce Corniche, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and 
Range Rover. Convertibles include Corvettes, Mazdas and Nissan 300ZXs. The 
company has more than 400 autos in its luxury line, called the "Car 
Collection," that can be rented for a day or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"During the weekends these things have been going like crazy," says Joe Molina, 
spokesman for Budget Rent-A-Car. "It's kind of a rent-a-fantasy type thing. We 
call it the Walter Mitty syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who want to live like royalty on the weekends but 
might not be able to afford the $207,000 it takes to buy a Rolls -- and people 
who think they're Magnum P.I. and want to cruise down Coast Highway in a 
Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Bisaha of Tustin plans to feed her husband's fantasy of taking off in 
an eye-popper by renting a $500-a-day red Rolls- Royce Corniche as a Father's 
Day present. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a fantasy of my husband's to drive down Coast Highway in a 
Rolls-Royce with the baby in the back seat," says the 31-year-old mother of a 
toddler. "It's definitely a splurge. I've never done anything this extravagant 
before. Ordinarily, if I were going to blow the budget it would be for 
something we'd buy, not rent. But this is for him." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult part isn't the cost, she adds. "It's trying to figure out 
what to wear with it." 
</P>
<P>
According to John Peterson, director of marketing for Budget Rent-A-Car in 
Orange County, the fantasy renter constitutes about a third of Budget's market. 
</P>
<P>
"During prom season our phone rang off the hook," he says, adding that the age 
requirement is 21 years for most luxury cars and 25 years for a Rolls or 
Ferrari. "Unfortunately, they are a little too young to rent a $70,000 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
The other renters are tourists and business people who want to impress clients. 
</P>
<P>
As for tourists, they are easily tempted by luxury, says Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in town, they need a car and they'd rather rent a 190 Mercedes than 
a Ford Taurus," he says. "They're on vacation and they have the money in their 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Daily rental prices for Budget's exotic cars range from $59.99 for a Camaro 
IROC Z28 with 50 free miles to $500 plus $1 a mile for a Rolls-Royce Corniche. 
Convertible Corvettes rent for $179.99 a day with 50 free miles, BMW 325i 
convertibles rent for $149 with 50 free miles and Ferraris go for $350 a day 
and $1 a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Other local companies that rent luxury cars -- Avon, Executive and Enterprise 
-- have age and credit card requirements. Some car rental companies have luxury 
models available occasionally, such as Ferarris at A Select Rent-A-Car in 
Anaheim. But the Lincoln Town Car is the top of the line at most car rental 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson says convertibles are the most popular rentals and Corvettes the 
hottest style for Budget. The next biggest mover is the BMW 325i convertible. 
</P>
<P>
He says dollar for dollar, renting exotic cars is cheaper than hiring a 
limousine, which costs about $50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put it in those terms, it's not that much money," says Peterson. "And 
you get the excitement of driving a $70,000 car you might otherwise never have 
the chance to drive."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: 9 YEARS OFF AND ON PRODUCES A FIRST NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach author Jack Williamson calls his novel "But Not Warriors." 
</P>
<P>
It's about the lame, the hard of hearing and the vision-impaired. They have bad 
backs, fallen arches and "debilitating orthopedic mis-alignments." 
</P>
<P>
They are the men of the 575th Military Police Escort Guard Company -- 136 
"unfit for combat" World War II draftees from the hills and "hollers" of West 
Virginia and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't matter to their commanding officer, a combat-hungry World War 
I veteran who has never forgiven the Germans for surrendering on the very day 
that he set foot in France. 
</P>
<P>
Determined not to miss out on World War II, Capt. Cadwallader Aloysius Maxwell 
decides to put his company of "limited service" troops through a 
combat-training program. But instead of going overseas, they are assigned to 
guard a Japanese-American relocation camp in the Arizona desert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fiction but based on my experiences in the barracks of World War II," 
said Williamson, 64, who at the age of 18 spent several months on guard duty 
outside a Japanese relocation camp in Arizona. (Although a weak right eye gave 
him "limited service" status, Williamson later served as a medic in the 
Philippines. "I had to memorize an eye chart to get overseas," he says.) 
</P>
<P>
"But Not Warriors" (Lynx Books) is Williamson's first novel. 
</P>
<P>
A former newspaper reporter who worked nearly 10 years for the Oakland Tribune 
and shot newsreels for a San Francisco TV station, Williamson spent the next 20 
years making training, sales and public relations films for major corporations. 
Since 1980, he has been a free-lance writer for trade magazines. 
</P>
<P>
He started writing "But Not Warriors" nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd write some and then I'd put it down for a year and pick it up and say, 
'That's not bad,' and write some more," said Williamson, who believes "a new 
writer really should write from inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
"For any new writer who is not writing professionally, it's foolish for him or 
her to look at a blank piece of paper and say, 'I have to write for three hours 
today,' or complete six pages. It's better to write when inspiration strikes 
you. It will take longer, but at least when you get through, everything you 
have written will be the result of inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
"But of course," he added with a laugh, "if you sell one (book) and you're 
going to go into that business, then you need discipline in order to turn out 
the next one." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said that although "But Not Warriors" is humorous, it also has 
tragic elements. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese-American relocation camp was a terrible tragedy, and the book 
treats it as such," he said. "Even though the goings-on outside the wire are 
humorous, it treats the Japanese very sympathetically." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said the entire time he was writing his novel, "people were telling 
me, 'You can't sell a first novel.' . . . I said that doesn't apply to me. I 
thought it was a good book, a good story." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Williamson said the book sold in 12 days and earned him a $25,000 
advance -- more than double the typical advance for a first novel. 
</P>
<P>
The author, who recently moved to Newport Beach from Riverside, is currently 
working on three novels at the same time and, he said, he and his publisher are 
discussing a multiple book contract. 
</P>
<P>

IRVINE YOUTH TURNS HIS PASSION INTO A PROFESSION

<P>
It was a bold move for Eran Feigenbaum to pass out business cards to anyone and 
everyone he knew or saw. 
</P>
<P>
Those first cards had a simple message printed on them: "Eran the Magician. I 
do and teach magic." 
</P>
<P>
But for a 12-year-old who barely knew anything about magic and had no tricks to 
show anybody except for one involving a pair of Chinese linking rings, the 
business cards represented a desire to become a magician -- and a famous one. 
</P>
<P>
Just before then, Feigenbaum had purchased his first magic set for $70, never 
knowing that it would become such a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 16, Feigenbaum has succeeded in establishing a name for himself in the 
International Society of Magicians, as well as organizing a career for himself 
as a professional magician. 
</P>
<P>
Feigenbaum, a junior at University High School in Irvine, performs three types 
of magic tricks for his audiences: stage magic, kid magic and mental magic. 
</P>
<P>
With an excited voice and shining bright eyes, Feigenbaum described magic as a 
phase of his life that has yet to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody loves magic," he said. "It exists, and everyone has it inside, but 
the problem is just how to use it. For example, there are those who are able to 
smell and create scents in perfumes in their dreams because they have learned 
how to use that skill. Magic is just like that. All of us have it -- we just 
don't know how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic is something that a normal person cannot do, but I, supposedly as an 
abnormal person, am able to do." 
</P>
<P>
Feigenbaum became interested in magic at the age of 9, when he saw a magician 
performing the famous Chinese linking rings routine on stage. As a result, the 
youngster enrolled in a magic class, read all the books he possibly could on 
the subject and bought performing sets to practice tricks. 
</P>
<P>
He dreamed that one day he would be skilled enough to perform the linking rings 
routine, which, according to Feigenbaum, is one of the hardest tricks to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Living with his family in New Jersey at the time, Feigenbaum was not alone with 
his interest in magic. Along with a group of five friends, Feigenbaum formed 
the Gang of Magicians, whose members shared routines and performances with one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, Feigenbaum returned to Israel, where he was born. Because of a lack of 
enthusiasm for magic and magicians there, he stopped performing. He put away 
his magic props into two chest drawers and began involving himself in other 
activities such as karate and computers. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, kids are more fascinated with magic than in Israel 
because they are exposed to it at an earlier age," he said. "I didn't know of 
one kid in the U.S. who didn't own a magic set. But in Israel, it wasn't like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Feigenbaum tried his best to set aside his interest in magic, he was 
unsuccessful. He began saving up his allowance and was finally able to purchase 
a pair of linking rings. His first public performance -- at a friend's birthday 
party -- earned him $10 and, at the age of 14, marked the beginning of his 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked back at that performance as almost being a complete failure," 
Feigenbaum said. "To the crowd it looked great, but not to me. I put a lot more 
effort into my shows now." 
</P>
<P>
Feigenbaum's efforts were appreciated by his friends as well as fellow 
professional magicians in Israel. At 14, he became the youngest member ever to 
join the Israeli Society of Magicians, an elite group of professional 
performers. By then, he was earning awards for his routines and acts. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Feigenbaum represented the Israeli Society of Magicians and Israel 
at the 1988 Federation of International Society of Magicians convention in 
Holland, often referred to as the "Olympics of Magic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning to the United States with his family, Feigenbaum has performed 
at a number of national conventions, but none so prestigious as the one in 
Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the international convention was the highest realm that I could 
ever reach on the magical rings," he said. "Anything after it is a real 
downer." 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, Feigenbaum performs at parties and for such charity organizations as 
the Cancer Society and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. He also practices his 
skills at the Magic Castle in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He said he earns between $100 and $500 -- "weekend money" -- for each 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
But Feigenbaum looks at his career in magic as a temporary one. 
</P>
<P>
"I like magic because I'm not forced to do it," he said. "It is a lot like 
acting -- when you are a teen-ager, you act for fun, not because you have to do 
it. But when you're doing it 24 hours a day, you're doing it to support 
yourself -- to live. It would make an unstable career, but magic will always be 
a hobby for me."

ORGANIZERS OF BLOOD DRIVES GET HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students from 40 county high schools were recently honored by the American Red 
Cross Orange County chapter for organizing more than 100 blood drives over the 
past year that resulted in the donation of more than 6,130 units of blood, or 
6% of the county's blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
Individual schools, students and advisers received awards for their 
participation in a variety of categories. Kathy Kemnitz of Pacifica High School 
was named the most valuable student contact, and Keith Sims of El Toro High the 
most valuable adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High was noted for the greatest number of units donated (230), 
followed by Foothill (211) and Dana Hills (208). Whittier Christian was named 
the most improved school with an increase of 133 units over last year, followed 
by Los Amigos and Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Two schools were honored with perpetual trophies for greatest participation per 
capita. La Vista High in Fullerton received the award for the third consecutive 
year for a school with an enrollment of up to 450 (52% participation), followed 
by Whittier Christian (38.6%) and Servite (32.9%). Foothill received the same 
award for a school with more than 450 students (28.6%), followed by San 
Clemente (22.7%) and Loara (21.8%). 
</P>
<P>
To donate blood, students must be at least 17 years of age, weigh at least 110 
pounds and be in good health. 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County students were named winners last week in the Centennial Time 
Capsule Student Essay Contest. 
</P>
<P>
The winning essays will be included in a time capsule that will be buried in 
Santa Ana on the grounds of the Old County Courthouse on Aug. 1 with 
instructions not to open until the year 2089. 
</P>
<P>
The essay contest was sponsored by The Times Orange County Edition and Orange 
County Centennial Inc. Almost 3,000 essays were submitted from schools 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
The winners are Stephanie Loy, a senior at Ocean View High School; Christy 
Westad, a freshman at Laguna Hills High; Jonathan Seymour, a sixth-grader at 
Mesa View School in Huntington Beach, and Alyssa Atzeff, a second-grader at 
Arroyo Elementary School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Each winner received $100; their schools each received $150.

SINGLE LIFE: WOMEN AS SUITORS: REVERSE ROLE IS AN IDEA AFTER ONE'S OWN HEART, 
RESPONDENTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, Single Life offered an assortment of opinions on Dutch-treat dating. 
The second part of this equal-rights issue is: Should women feel at liberty to 
ask men out? 
</P>
<P>
This time around, the answers were much more uniform -- "yes," "sure," 
"certainly," and "why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Carter Guiso most assuredly approves of females taking the initiative in 
requesting a date. And she didn't stop there; Guiso even proposed marriage to 
her object of pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Her assertiveness worked. On June 3, she and Brad Guiso were married. 
</P>
<P>
"I encourage women to act on those impulses. Who knows what the result will 
be?" Guiso wrote in a letter to Single Life. 
</P>
<P>
"I always used to ask guys out; I think it's fine," Guiso said in an interview. 
"Guys have told me they feel flattered when women ask them out." 
</P>
<P>
In her husband's case, Guiso, 23, telephoned Brad one night and invited him 
over to help her study. That was the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Then about a year later, she popped the question. "We'd sort of talked about 
getting married, but nothing had been said formally. I just decided it was 
time," recalled the Irvine resident, who is the assistant director of marketing 
for the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
Her fiance-to-be reacted with shock -- "and he doesn't get shocked easily," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing?' " he said. "But I thought 
it was great. I graciously accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Untimid Tammy rolled right ahead in her disregard for tradition. "We went over 
to my parents' house and Tammy asked my folks if she could marry me," said 
Brad, 28, an accountant with a real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it when women asked me out," he added. "It was a relief knowing I get 
to decide this time whether I want to go out rather than being on the other 
side where you're wondering: 'Is this person going to say yes or no?' Women 
should do it more often, so that they understand the position from the flip 
side." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's nice when women do the asking," said Kirk Morgan, 29, a sales 
manager in Laguna Beach. "People are too busy to wait for the old-fashioned 
boy-ask-girl thing; they have to take the opportunity when they can. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm too busy -- I go on business trips for two weeks at a time, and 
when I get back I feel like I've lost touch with everyone. So I like it when a 
woman calls me." 
</P>
<P>
If the woman strikes up the date, Morgan tentatively figured, she should fund 
it: "I'm such a traditionalist when it comes to paying. But I suppose that with 
the luxury of asking goes the burden of debt" -- and, also, the burden of a 
possible "thanks, but no thanks." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd decline if it wasn't the right person," Morgan said. "Women turn down men 
all the time. It's a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
"I have zero problem with women asking me out," said the unequivocal Joseph 
Poirier, 60, a real estate broker in Garden Grove. "It happens to me once or 
twice a month. If I'm not interested, I usually deflect the rejection by saying 
that I'm in an established relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Molinari, 20, wrote that she has asked out two men in her short life. 
One date proved disastrous, the other a huge success. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriends thought it was utterly shameless for me to ask a guy to my 
senior prom," Molinari said in her letter. "I may have ended up footing the 
bill while my friends got a freebie, but you get back what you put in. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the failure rate seems as high as 50%, I wouldn't hesitate to ask a 
man out again." 
</P>
<P>
The other 50% of that statistic, Molinari said in an interview, occurred when 
she was 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I called a boy in my French class and asked him to a concert," remembered the 
Anaheim resident, who works as a nanny. "It was very hard, mustering the 
courage. I had written down a whole script of what I was going to say. I told 
him I didn't have a car, but that if he was willing to drive I'd pay for the 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. French Class, Molinari said, turned out to be a "real pistol." "He treated 
me like a guy because I'm the one who asked him out. He said things like, 'You 
don't expect me to open the car door for you, do you?' " 
</P>
<P>
That lousy experience did not deter Molinari from trying again two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari's prom date was the last boy her Mormon parents and friends would have 
picked for her. "He had a Mohawk (haircut); Mormon girls don't date guys who 
look like that," she said, laughing. "My parents probably thought it was 
another one of Michelle's pranks. I mean, your prom picture is something you 
show to your grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
But Molinari detected a heart of gold below that unorthodox hairdo. And by

The Soviet Union officially acknowledged for the first time today that there 
was a powerful nuclear explosion at an atomic weapons plant in the Ural 
Mountains in September, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, kept secret by authorities until now, created a radioactive trail 
65 miles long and 5 to 6 miles wide, and forced the evacuation of more than 
10,000 people, the official Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 years later, large areas around the town of Kasli, 60 miles north 
of the city of Chelyabinsk, were still contaminated and water reserves were 
undrinkable, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Western experts have long suspected that there was a serious nuclear accident 
in the area about that time.

American motorists, facing higher pump prices, are buying less gasoline than 
last year, a U.S. government agency reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Information Administration today reported that demand for the four 
weeks ending June 9 averaged 0.2% less than the same period in 1988 -- 7.432 
million barrels a day versus 7.450 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
For the year to date, the Energy Information Administration, a unit of the 
Energy Department in Washington, said its figures show demand is a minuscule 
0.1% above last year. The agency had estimated that U.S. gasoline consumption 
would rise 1.3% in 1989 to an average 7.41 million barrels a day, compared to 
last year's 7.31 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline pump prices have risen nearly 20 cents a gallon on an average 
nationwide in recent months.

A United Express commuter plane carrying 33 passengers on a flight to Oakland 
was forced to return to John Wayne Airport this morning after the pilot of the 
twin-engine turboprop noticed an oil pressure warning light. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, Flight 3382, took off at 7:17 a.m. and landed at 7:28 a.m. without 
incident, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Skeen, a senior vice president for United Express, said the passengers 
were placed on alternate flights. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot simply saw an oil pressure indicator light and, for safety reasons, 
he did the prudent thing. That's what they're trained to do," Skeen said. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanics at John Wayne Airport were examining the plane this morning but had 
not yet found the problem that caused the warning light to go on, Skeen said.

Israel's chief of staff, in his strongest rebuff to right-wing politicians 
demanding a military solution to the Palestinian uprising, has said that only 
mass deportation, starvation or genocide can stop the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron's remarks, broadcast today, followed growing calls from 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party for the army to crush the 
18-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask why we don't end the intifada (uprising)," Shomron told businessmen 
in a speech in Ashkelon on Thursday night. "Anyone who wants to end the 
intifada must remember that there are only three ways to achieve this -- 
transfer, starvation or physical elimination -- that is, genocide." 
</P>
<P>
Likud strongman Ariel Sharon, who masterminded Israel's 1982 invasion of 
Lebanon, is demanding that the uprising be crushed before Israel allows 
Palestinians to hold elections to choose peace negotiators.

President Bush issued guidelines for federal prosecutors today that he said 
will virtually prohibit plea bargains in gun-related felonies, raising the 
stakes for those who view crime as a "crap shoot." 
</P>
<P>
"When a criminal thinks about reaching for a gun, they are going to know, they 
are going to learn, that they are going to do time," Bush told a White House 
gathering of 90 U.S. attorneys general from across the nation. "And when a 
criminal carries a gun and someone dies, he should die," the President added, 
again endorsing capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines took effect immediately, aides said. The President said he would 
like state and local prosecutors to join in the plea bargain guidelines 
developed under Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh for federal authorities.

Moving to put his own mark on the Oval Office, President Bush has jettisoned 
the desk first used by John F. Kennedy, his spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ordered his own desk, which he has used since May 2, 
1985, installed in the Oval Office on June 13. "He had it as vice president, 
and he got used to it, found it comfortable, thought it was attractive," 
Fitzwater said, elaborating on Bush's new work station. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's desk was one of four made-to-order about 1920 for the owners of the 
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co. It was placed in the company's office in Ohio. 
Later, the CSX Corp., parent company of the C&amp;O Railway donated the desk to 
the White House. After his inauguration, Bush used the desk in his private 
residential quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the desk replaces the one "used there by Presidents Kennedy, 
Carter and Reagan." The old desk has been returned to the White House storage 
bin.

Eastman Kodak Co. today announced it will consolidate its four consumer 
photography products and picture finishing systems operations, a move that will 
result in the loss of several hundred jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Paul Allen said by year's end the new division will join 
together the consumer products, photo finishing systems and United States sales 
divisions. It also will include the administrative service area within the 
photo products group. 
</P>
<P>
The move, part of Kodak's continued cost-cutting strategy, is an effort to 
strengthen its consumer photography business. 
</P>
<P>
"We do anticipate we'll have to cut our work force by several hundred, but we 
don't know exactly how many at this point. We'll have a better fix on that by 
the end of the summer," said Allen. 
</P>
<P>
The job cuts would occur in support areas and would be primarily confined to 
the company's Rochester headquarters, said Allen. "There will be no major 
impact in the field among our sales force or at our manufacturing facilities," 
Allen said.

Despite falling interest rates, housing construction continued to decline in 
May, down 2.1% from the previous month to the lowest level since the last 
recession in 1982, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22% in March before falling to 10.2% by last 
week, had been blamed for the recent decline in housing activity. Analysts had 
thought the falling rates would boost the pace. Nevertheless, new homes and 
apartments in May were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 
million units, down from 1.34 million in April when construction fell 5%, the 
Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive monthly decline, the longest string since 
activity slowed for five months in a row from February through June, 1987. The 
April level was the slowest pace since the 1.30 million rate in December, 1982.

Strikebound Eastern Airlines today announced it has agreed to sell its eight 
Philadelphia airport gates and other assets to Midway Airlines for $206 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern announced the move in a federal bankruptcy court hearing on an earlier 
agreement under which it would have sold the Philadelphia gates and two 
U.S.-Canadian routes to USAir Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland for permission to 
terminate its agreement with Washington-based USAir and to replace it with the 
accord with Chicago-based Midway. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department recently said it planned to file an antitrust suit 
blocking the $85-million proposed sale to USAir of Eastern's airport gates in 
Philadelphia and its Philadelphia-Toronto and Philadelphia-Montreal routes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boudin, acting antitrust chief for the Justice Department, had said the 
sale to USAir "threatens to lessen competition" in airline service between 
Philadelphia and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Pennsylvania also challenged the proposed USAir purchase, saying 
the transaction could lead to higher ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
USAir already has nearly one third of the flights into and out of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Zirinsky, an attorney for Eastern, said the airline held negotiations 
with Midway officials through Thursday night and into this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Under their new agreement, he said, Midway would purchase all eight 
Philadelphia gates, the two Canadian routes, two landing slots at New York's 
LaGuardia Airport, two slots at Washington National Airport, and 16 McDonnell 
Douglas DC-9 aircraft.
