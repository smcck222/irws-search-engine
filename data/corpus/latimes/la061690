A CRACKDOWN IN A GOOD CAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS FEEL THE HEAT AS THE COPS SWOOP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The huge federal roundup and arrest of Crips and Bloods gang members in 11 
states this week won't end the Southern California gang problem by any means. 
No one is claiming that, including the federal agents who organized this 
seemingly precise and wholly remarkable operation. But over the short run at 
least, well-conceived law enforcement action will help. And for providing 
precisely this public service, the hundreds of federal agents from the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and other federal and local agencies deserve 
all the credit in the world for taking on these hard cases and attempting to 
bring them to justice. 
</P>
<P>
Culminating months of work, the agents invaded the gangs' blood-soaked 
territories and made more than 160 arrests over the two-day roundup -- many in 
L.A., Orange, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. These included gang 
leaders who terrorize neighborhoods, organize drug distribution and conduct 
drive-by shootings aimed at rival gang members but which often hit innocent 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
The gang problem in America is clearly an organized crime problem as well as a 
youth and family-disintegration problem. There is an important role for 
tough-minded law enforcement to play in combatting it. Targeting the leaders of 
the Crips and Bloods could weaken the organizations, just as taking out top 
Mafia leaders hurts their organizations. But there's nothing to stop the No. 2 
guys from now moving up. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the news is encouraging, because it indicates that the feds have not 
given up as the young gangsters continue to peddle crack and commit murder. The 
crackdown also occurs at a time when the price of cocaine is rising. Forcing up 
the price won't stop the most desperate addicts, but it will discourage more 
casual users and make it harder for the gangs involved in drugs to make their 
heavy profits. 
</P>
<P>
The gang-related death toll in Los Angeles last year set records. The combined 
body count for Los Angeles city and county approached 1,000 -- mostly young 
men, of course. Rarely a day passes without a gang-related murder. As the wars 
escalated, sons -- and a few daughters -- died. As the turf battles became 
fiercer, parents -- and a few grandparents -- got in the way. Some victims were 
more innocent than others, but each time someone died, someone mourned. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any solutions? Gun control would help; drive-by shootings are hard to 
pull off with a knife. So would better schools, better drug control, more 
community involvement, more youth program innovation, more job-training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
But better law enforcement -- which includes more law enforcement cooperation 
and planning -- has a huge role to play. These gangs must be made to feel the 
heat. The heat came down on them this week. Everyone who cares about this 
problem is extremely grateful.

JANET ADKINS' CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am outraged by the story of the doctor who actively assisted the death of a 
woman with Alzheimer's disease. The prosecutors in Michigan will decide whether 
what Kevorkian did was illegal, but as a physician specializing in the care of 
persons with dementia I know that what he did was unethical and bad medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian was a pathologist and he was not the woman's doctor. He would have 
little knowledge regarding the care of patients with Alzheimer's disease, nor 
would he know the important details of this woman's case. Did Kevorkian know if 
she were depressed, did he advise her and her family on ways to maintain the 
quality of her life, did he know if she were truly competent to decide to 
commit suicide? Did he do anything to try to alleviate her suffering, or did he 
just hasten her death? 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease is a progressively debilitating illness that robs a person 
of his or her mind. Although there is no cure yet for this illness, that does 
not mean there is no treatment. Working together, patients, families, support 
groups and physicians can do much to maintain the quality of life of someone 
with Alzheimer's disease. Despite their cognitive deficits most patients in the 
early and middle stages of the illness can still enjoy being with people, can 
still appreciate the comforts of life, can still give and accept the love of 
their families. As the illness advances, usually the patient becomes blessedly 
unaware of the problem. It is at that stage that most physicians will allow the 
patient to die from the illness by withholding the medical support that 
artificially sustains life. Even then, the decision must be made by the family 
and physician taking into consideration the patient's previously known wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The participants in active euthanasia are avoiding the difficult problems of 
making the quality of life better for a patient with a bad disease. They are 
taking the convenient way out for themselves, masquerading their needs as mercy 
for the patient. It was murder, not mercy and not medical care.

JANET ADKINS' CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to "Ailing Woman Uses Doctor's Suicide Device," front page, June 6: 
</P>
<P>
Those who have watched in pity and revulsion relatives or friends deteriorate 
to where they are unable to control urine and feces, and cannot recognize us as 
they slowly die, understand Janet Adkins' desire to be remembered as an 
energetic and talented person. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding her death by assisted suicide contrasts our 
standards of life and death whereby we put to death those who do not wish to 
die, first the victims of murder and then their assailants, but do not grant 
the request of those who, for legitimate reasons, do want to die. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Adkins could have attempted suicide unassisted, but an attempt sometimes 
goes awry and the already suffering person is left in an even worse medical 
state. Other patients, for example those with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), may 
want to commit suicide but are too debilitated to effect the act. And by then 
they know that it is too late to leave life with dignity and avoid embedding 
terminal pathetic images of themselves in the memories of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Under proper medical scrutiny, assisted suicide offers an option to the anguish 
of life's dilemma: its inevitable termination. That the proper scrutiny may 
have been lacking in Mrs. Adkins' case may not be so much the fault of Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian, but of a medical-legal system that interferes with a private right 
to terminate one's life. 
</P>
<P>
The Quinlan case in New Jersey, where parents obtained a court order to 
disconnect their comatose daughter's respirator, sensitized the public to the 
right to die when all hope is lost. The Adkins case in Michigan may galvanize 
public consciousness to the right to die before all dignity is lost.

According to your article, the American Medical Assn. thinks it's OK for a 
doctor to starve a patient to death ("passive euthanasia"), but it's not OK for 
a doctor to provide the means for a patient to end his (her) life. What goes on 
here?

JANET ADKINS' CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ethical issue of euthanasia, whether active or passive, appears to be 
emerging once again and quite possibly on its way to the federal courts with 
the willful death of Janet Adkins. 
</P>
<P>
Our society accepts without question that living and maintaining someone's 
right to live is the morally correct stance, while assisting a person in a 
medical suicide is considered a killing. 
</P>
<P>
The oath to do no harm taken by Kevorkian has not, in one sense, been broken 
because the issue in question is whether more harm is coming from death, or by 
forcing a person to live. Are we dealing at all with the emotional and 
psychological harms to the person or only whether the person lives or dies? 
</P>
<P>
It is time to discard the notion that death must always be the last resort and 
always be considered "bad" and ask ourselves whether there may be more to death 
than simply dying and, conversely, less to life than just living.

<P>
No law can effectively stop a person from ending his or her life, unless that 
person is physically totally handicapped. The issue raised by Kevorkian is 
whether there should be legally-available "professional" assistance to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Those who base their objection on their reluctance to see the medical 
profession involved are getting ahead of themselves. Only if we accept the 
notion that the option should be available, and only then, is the issue of who 
should do the assisting relevant. 
</P>
<P>
I believe a properly regulated assistance, affording proper safeguards to a 
willing patient, would do away with too many unsuccessful and horribly 
injurious suicide attempts. And hopefully it will be physicians, with their 
know-how and hopefully-improved ethics, who will do the assisting. Who else? 
Some accountant or lawyer or war vet with his undeniable expertise?

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to Justice William J. Brennan Jr. for having the intelligence 
and courage to lead a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in its second decision 
striking down laws which prohibit an individual from burning the American flag 
("High Court Voids Law Against Burning Flag," Part A, June 12). Our flag is a 
wonderful symbol of the principles for which thousands of our citizens have 
given their lives. But only by allowing and tolerating the antics of the 
various cretins who would ever destroy such a symbol can we truly support and 
protect the concepts of liberty and freedom for which the flag has so long 
stood. 
</P>
<P>
If flag burning is outlawed, we are destroying a main ideal for which our flag 
has become respected throughout the world. It comes down to a rather elementary 
balancing test. Do we preserve the flag, the piece of cloth, the symbol, or do 
we preserve the true principles of freedom and liberty which the flag 
represents? These options are mutually exclusive, and there can be only one 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
There must be no amendment of the Bill of Rights to prohibit the flag's 
destruction. I find it incredible that Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Robert 
H. Michel (R-Ill.), rather minor characters compared to the brilliant people 
who drafted the Bill of Rights, could take it upon themselves to attempt to 
sway Congress, state legislators and the American public that such an amendment 
is necessary. The public at least, is smarter than that, and will realize that 
the Bill of Rights, which was so well written, and which has stood so well for 
199 years unamended, should not be modified for political gain under the guise 
of patriotism. True patriotism calls for us to protect the ideals of the 
Constitution, even if that means tolerating political expression that we find 
unacceptable.

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of amending the Constitution to make it illegal to burn or otherwise 
desecrate the flag, I suggest enacting a law that would equate such desecration 
with a voluntary renunciation of the perpetrator's U.S. citizenship. Those 
individuals who choose to show such disrespect for our country's flag would 
then no longer enjoy the benefits of citizenship, such as protection from 
prosecution for acts of vandalism by appealing to the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't these non-citizens then be subject to deportation to a country whose 
flag is more to their liking?

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flag burning -- what a perfect political issue for our times. The fact that few 
resort to burning it is irrelevant. For facts don't count for much in a 
political process where our leaders engage in a calculated dance of deception. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians wrap themselves in the flag, not so much out of a love of country 
as a cloak for self-interest. They know that emotionally charged pictures and 
the manipulation of symbols that touch our core beliefs make it possible to 
appeal to our emotions and bypass our intellect. And our votes, based on these 
non-issues, are marginalized in the process. 
</P>
<P>
So, we face the decade of the '90s with our political dialogue filled with 
symbolic messages, packaged for easy consumption, with little or no relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, our environment deteriorates, our society becomes more and more 
polarized economically and socially, our economy flounders as it attempts to 
compete with Germany, Japan and others, and our government becomes more and 
more repressive. What a sad legacy for all those who fought and died for Old 
Glory.

Well, I expect the reaction to Supreme Court decision will produce some useful 
changes. The idea that flag burning is protected by the Bill of Rights will 
almost certainly result in an amendment that will make this ancient document 
more appropriate to the makeup and needs of the modern American society.

MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING DEATH OF AUTO SHOP OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tip from a witness led to the arrest Friday of a man believed to be involved 
in the shooting death Thursday of a West Los Angeles transmission shop owner 
who was killed during a robbery in which cash and an expensive Rolex watch were 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident in Los Angeles this week in which the theft of a 
Rolex led to death. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Friday arrested Phillip Conrad Sanders, 38, in the shooting death of 
Melvin Thompson, 49, owner of Kayser's Service in the 11000 block of Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a tip from a witness led them to a Sylmar house where Sanders had 
been staying. A second man was still being sought Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was being held without bail at the West Los Angeles police station 
after he was booked on suspicion of murder, Detective Andy Monsue said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Sanders was the gunman who shot and killed Thompson as he 
was closing up shop for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to release many details of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said the gunman entered the shop, took an undetermined amount of 
cash and then took the watch from Thompson, who was alone. 
</P>
<P>
During the incident, Thompson was shot several times but it was not clear if he 
was shot before or after the robbery or if he struggled with the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then fled in a car driven by a second man, whom police have not been 
able to identify, Monsue said. A witness saw the car fleeing the scene and 
jotted down the license number, police said. Police, using that information, 
traced Sanders to the Sylmar home. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's wife of 10 years, Catherine, was on her way to the shop to pick up 
her husband at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Approaching the garage, "I heard what I thought was backfire," but someone told 
her that a man with a gun had entered the shop. She fled, she said, and called 
911 from a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was taken to the UCLA Medical Center where he died at 7:30 p.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Thompson said her husband never took the watch to work, bringing it 
out only on "weekends and special occasions." 
</P>
<P>
"He never wore it to the shop," she said. But he decided he would take it to a 
jeweler Thursday. "He had lost some weight and he needed to have some links 
taken out." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, his wife said, did not worry about his safety because he considered 
it a relatively safe neighborhood. Still, he told her that if someone ever held 
up the store while she was working, she should turn over all the money without 
arguing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Thompson said her husband's shop had been burglarized several times 
before, including once about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard," she said, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
Her grief was shared by others who knew Thompson. "He was a nice guy who always 
tried to help people," said Patty Downs, a secretary from Bud Hand Sports Car 
Co., located across the street from Kayser's. "He would do anything you asked. 
He even loaned money to street people." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's death marked the second shooting in a week tied to the theft of a 
Rolex watch, which can range in value from $950 to $23,000. On Tuesday, a 
42-year-old man was shot in his newly purchased Beverly Hills home by a gunman 
who struggled with him over one of the watches. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Grissin, spokeswoman for Rolex, a New York City-based watch company, said 
she was aware of the two incidents in Los Angeles, but had not received word of 
similar thefts in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Monsue said police were exploring the possibility that Thompson's 
killer was someone he knew previously -- either as a customer or an 
acquaintance.

ENGINEER HELD IN ILLEGAL 'STAR WARS' SALES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HE IS ARRESTED BY U.S. CUSTOMS AGENTS AND CHARGED WITH TRYING TO SELL 
RESTRICTED DATA. EXPORTS TO FOUR JAPANESE FIRMS ARE ALSO UNDER INVESTIGATION.

U.S. Customs agents posing as brokers for South African businessmen arrested a 
Los Angeles engineer who has been charged with illegally attempting to sell 
them technical data from a restricted Strategic Defense Initiative missile 
research project, federal authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that the engineer, Ronald J. Hoffman, 51, was also under 
investigation for exporting or agreeing to export similar data to at least four 
Japanese industrial firms over the last four years. Federal authorities said 
they were uncertain whether any of the Japanese firms were aware that the 
technology was being sold illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey said that documents, computer records and 
facsimile machine files seized Thursday night during a search of Hoffman's 
Beverly Glen home indicated that the engineer's "Star Wars" sales to the 
Japanese may have netted him "hundreds of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
In a 52-page affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, authorities 
said they were also investigating allegations that Hoffman, working through his 
defense contracting firm, Plume Technology, illegally exported or agreed to 
sell missile software systems to firms in West Germany and Italy and also to 
Israel's Ministry of Defense. Fahey said that Hoffman had boasted of being in 
contact with the head of the Israeli government's missile program. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Customs spokesman David Hoover explained that the sting 
operation was part of "Operation Exodus," a continuing federal effort to stem 
the flow of high-technology data and munitions from the United States to 
Eastern Bloc nations, Cuba, North Korea and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman was arrested Thursday afternoon at a hotel near Los Angeles 
International Airport moments after he accepted a $150,000 check from a Customs 
agent. Several minutes earlier, according to the affidavit, two agents watched 
as Hoffman placed a cardboard box containing SDI computer software into a 
Federal Express mail slot. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. Magistrate Robert M. Stone ordered Hoffman held on $500,000 
bail. Hoffman, a tousled-haired man who wore sandals with his blue prison 
uniform, said little as he stood beside his defense attorney, Roger Rosen. 
Hoffman was expected to post bond and be released later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman was charged with attempting to sell a computer software system known as 
"Contam," that is being developed as part of SDI research. By examining the 
exhaust trail left behind by launched missiles, the software could enable 
weapons tracking stations to "identify what type of rocket or missile was 
launched and how best to counteract it," authorities said in the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this the illegal export of some of our most precious national 
commodities," Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
Fahey declined to say whether authorities had contacted South African officials 
before the agents posed as brokers for that country. Henk Roodt, the South 
African consul in Beverly Hills, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
But in a federal courtroom, awaiting Hoffman's bail hearing Friday, one federal 
agent laughed: "We took it out of Lethal Weapon (II)." The reference was to a 
1989 action film that portrayed South African diplomats as murderers and 
smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
In their disguises as brokers for South Africa, authorities said, Customs 
agents Steven J. Bosseler and Jorge Urquijo struck a deal with Hoffman to pay 
him $150,000 in return for his sale of the computer data. To avoid federal laws 
restricting the sale of SDI equipment to South Africa, Hoffman agreed to ship 
the software to Bonn, West Germany, where the agents told him the material 
would then be transferred to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, authorities were first tipped off about Hoffman's 
activities by a man whose wife worked for the engineer at a Century City firm, 
the Science Application International Corp. Hoffman resigned from that company 
in December, 1989, authorities said, after executives with the firm learned 
about his Japanese dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman is charged with violating U.S. export laws by exporting SDI and missile 
research materials without proper authorization. According to the affidavit, 
Hoffman failed to obtain proper State Department clearances before he entered 
into agreements with the Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
Between April 26 and May 29, according to authorities, federal undercover 
agents met with Hoffman five times, persuading him to sell them Contam 
software. Customs agent Bosseler said in the affidavit that he told Hoffman he 
represented a South African client who "was in the aerospace business and was 
attempting to launch a rocket booster and communications satellite into space." 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the meetings, Hoffman appeared with a second man, whom he 
identified as "Rob Dobbs," a Los Angeles physician. Customs agents are still 
trying to learn his whereabouts, Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
During several of the meetings, Hoffman told the undercover agents that he was 
worried they were working for the government. 
</P>
<P>
"He expressed concerns that I might be a federal . . . agent trying to entrap 
him," Bosseler said. "Hoffman then proceeded to ask if I was a federal agent, 
to which I stated I was not. Hoffman said that he was very relieved." 
</P>

Washington. Also contributing was Times staff writer John Kendall in Los 
Angeles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL SITE TO BE GRADED AFTER 4 YEARS 
DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Montebello school board has decided to proceed with plans for a new 
elementary and intermediate school after four years of delays caused by legal 
wrangling and debates about safety at the 15-acre site in an industrial area in 
southeast Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The board made its decision Thursday after an engineering firm said in a 
preliminary report that soil at the site does no contain dangerous levels of 
contaminants. Construction is contingent on voter approval of a state bond 
issue in November, but the district still plans to grade the site and build 
school annex of portable classrooms to house 600 to 900 students at Bell 
Gardens High School.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE THAN 6,000 WOMEN SEEK DOCKWORKER JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 6,000 women from as far away as San Diego have returned application 
cards for the 350 part-time dockworker positions that will soon be made 
available at Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, a shipping industry official 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot more women than we expected, that's for sure," said Vince 
Lamaestra, labor relations administrator for the Pacific Maritime Assn., 
representing the ports' shippers and terminal operators. 
</P>
<P>
The 350 jobs, which pay $14 an hour, will go to women as part of a settlement 
of a decade-old discrimination lawsuit against the association and the 
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 13. A drawing will 
be held Friday at Local 13's offices in Wilmington to determine which women are 
hired.

Ain't progress wonderful? L.A.'s Transportation Department is experimenting 
with new digital parking meters -- the first ones that can be reprogrammed 
without being dismantled. In other words, they will make it easier for the city 
to raise parking rates. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mensa, the high-I.Q. organization, lowers its standards slightly to 
recruit members in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Mensans down there, hosting a national convention at the Anaheim Marriott, sent 
out a press release to The Times that began: 
</P>
<P>
"What happen when over one thousand geniuses get together under one roof?" 
</P>
<P>
We don't know -- what happen? 
</P>
<P>
Not a pretty picture: Drivers jumping out of cars -- including Porsches and 
BMWs -- to beg people exiting from Lucky markets. The yuppie panhandlers 
haven't been asking for money, though. They've been asking for grocery 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
It's all because of a promotion involving Lucky and Delta Airlines whereby 
anyone with grocery receipts totaling $100 or more could get discounts on 
airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Feliz-area shopper even saw would-be air travelers "scrambling around 
the floors, trying to find receipts that people had dropped." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of summer's approach (cont.): A traffic tie-up on the San Diego Freeway, 
caused by a spill of watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the tie-up on Sunset Boulevard caused by a giant hand that 
restrained a Cadillac in a parking lot as part of a concert promotion. It was 
an inflatable beast -- not the long arm of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of sights, Bill Cohen of West Covina has a tip for "Travel Tips," a 
program on the Discovery cable channel. There's no longer a "world-famous 
Marineland in Rancho Palos Verdes," as the travelogue informed viewers. 
Discovery also listed the nonexistent theme park in Orange County, which isn't 
true unless the Big One struck and we didn't notice. 
</P>
<P>
But we should talk. The other day, we mentioned that the last great train 
robbery in California occurred in Newhall in 1928. Louise Byers of San Marino 
begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Fred, was aboard a train on Feb. 22, 1933, when a man wearing a 
bandanna hopped aboard the observation car at a stop in Ontario. The bandit 
robbed Byers and two others but was then killed in a gunfight with the 
conductor, who also died. Fred Byers, now 82, suffered a slight leg wound from 
a ricochet. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was later recounted in the book "Great Train Robberies of the 
West." 
</P>
<P>
"My husband," said Louise Byers, "has always gotten a kick out of the fact that 
his name is in the index with Jesse James and the Dalton Gang." 
</P>
<P>
And that was the last train robbery. Unless you count the guy who was arrested 
the other day with a load of model trains that were stolen from a Rosemead 
collector.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHOOT-OUT SURVIVOR PLEADS GUILTY TO ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man pleaded guilty Friday to 10 felony counts stemming from a 
string of robberies at fast-food restaurants that ended in a police shoot-out 
in Sunland in which three accomplices were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Olivas, 19, entered the pleas in exchange for a promise by prosecutors 
not to seek a prison term longer than 17 years when he is sentenced July 24 in 
San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Olivas' accomplices robbed from 15 to 17 fast-food restaurants in 
the Los Angeles area between August, 1989, and the February shoot-out, when 
they were shot in their car by a controversial police unit, the Special 
Investigations Section, which had staked out the Sunland restaurant. 
Prosecutors had alleged that Olivas, who was wounded, took part in seven of the 
robberies.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VONS REOPENS DAIRY AFTER 2ND MILK RECALL IN 
MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vons Cos. reopened its South Los Angeles dairy Thursday, two weeks after 
shutting it down to determine why it was producing milk with an odd flavor and 
odor. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes Jerseymaid and Westwood brands of milk, will speed up 
its pasteurization process to avoid the problem that led to a voluntary milk 
recall from Vons' 328 stores. 
</P>
<P>
The recall was the second in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Wessell, spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said 
Friday that the milk didn't pose a health hazard. Wessell said state inspectors 
have instructed Vons to shorten the time the milk sits before being 
pasteurized. 
</P>
<P>
A previous, unrelated batch of bad milk had caused about 100 people to become 
ill with diarrhea and nausea. State officials blamed a malfunctioning cleaning 
system at the same plant, but Vons officials said they haven't determined a 
cause.

CARTER POWERS PADRES PAST DODGERS IN 13TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Carter, who entered the game tied for the National League lead with 50 runs 
batted in, got two more important ones Friday night with a 13th-inning home 
run, giving the San Diego Padres a 3-1 victory over the Dodgers before 39,620 
at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With Tony Gwynn running from first base, Carter hit a 1-and-2 pitch from 
reliever Mike Hartley into the left-field seats for his 12th home run of the 
season. Gwynn had reached base with a leadoff walk. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of innings, it was the Dodgers' longest game of the season. It was 
also the first in which Tom Lasorda used the motivational tool of coaching 
third base. And it was the Dodgers' fifth consecutive loss, one short of their 
longest losing streak of the season. It dropped the fourth-place Dodgers 11 
games behind the National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds, equaling their 
biggest deficit this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres ended a three-game losing streak and are in second place in the 
West, seven games behind Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres could have won in the 12th against relief pitcher Jim Gott. Garry 
Templeton drew a one-out walk and Phil Stephenson hit a ground-rule double to 
left field, Templeton going to third. But Gott struck out Shawn Abner and 
Roberto Alomar flied out to center field to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the Dodgers had already blown chances to win in the 10th, 11th and 
12th innings against relief pitchers Greg Harris and Calvin Schiraldi. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Alfredo Griffin was hit by a fastball. One out later, Lenny Harris 
reached on a 20-foot grounder that died in front of third baseman Mike 
Pagliarulo. Up stepped Kirk Gibson, accompanied by a roar from the several 
thousand remaining fans. 
</P>
<P>
But Gibson struck out swinging on four pitches, after which he threw his bat, 
spiked his helmet, and kicked the air. That made him hitless in four at-bats 
after he entered the night on a 10-for-22 roll. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th inning was nearly as frustrating for the Dodgers. With two outs, Stan 
Javier doubled down the left field line. It was Javier's second hit after being 
put in the starting lineup as a late replacement for sore-wristed Hubie Brooks. 
Rick Dempsey, who earlier had pinch-hit for Mike Scioscia, then walked on five 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Juan Samuel, hitless in 29 previous at-bats. He struck out on three 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the 12th, Lenny Harris singled to left and Gibson walked. But 
Jose Gonzalez struck out on three pitches from Schiraldi. 
</P>
<P>
During this time Dodger relievers Jay Howell and rookie Jim Poole, making his 
major league debut, had been stifling the Padres. Howell, in one of his best 
outings of the year, threw two hitless innings after replacing Dodger starter 
Fernando Valenzuela in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Poole entered the game in the 11th and struck out Tony Gwynn on 
five pitches, but was immediately replaced by Gott because the upcoming Padre 
hitters were right-handed. Poole, who was pitching for double-A San Antonio 
three days ago, left the game to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared either team could win the game in the eighth. But a fly ball to 
deep left field by Carter off Valenzuela stranded runners on first and second. 
And a fly ball to deep center field by Kal Daniels off relief pitcher Craig 
Lefferts stranded Dodgers on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored an unearned run off starter Andy Benes in the fourth inning, 
but the Padres scored against Valenzuela in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela gave up one run on seven hits in eight innings. Equally important 
for the Dodgers, he survived an apparent twisted ankle suffered in the seventh 
inning while fielding Mark Parent's bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Benes was spectacular but, then, the Dodgers have never seen him any other way. 
In seven innings, he gave up only five hits and one unearned run. It was the 
fourth time in his six starts against the Dodgers that Benes did not give up an 
earned run. The Dodgers have scored only two runs in 35 1/3 innings against 
him, an 0.50 earned-run average. Scioscia (12 career at-bats) and Samuel 
(seven) are hitless against Benes. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored first, in the fourth inning. With one out, a slumping 
Daniels, who entered the game with one hit in his previous 29 at-bats, grounded 
a ball that bounced off second baseman Alomar's glove. Daniels was safe at 
first on the error. Eddie Murray then draw a walk, Benes' first of the game. 
Javier then singled to center field to score Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, with two outs, Parent doubled to left field, scoring on a 
single by Templeton.

<P>
BASEBALL: ANGELS SUFFER A 2-1 DEFEAT WHEN HARVEY GIVES UP FOUR BASES ON BALLS 
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 10TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pitch number 200 thrown by the Angels was fouled off by Tiger rookie Scott 
Lusader. So was pitch number 201. The bases were loaded, two men were out, and 
a very long game was on the line in the 10th inning as Lusader, who had been 
summoned from the minor leagues on Tuesday, dug in against Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to make Harv work himself into the position where he had to 
throw a strike," Angel catcher Lance Parrish said. "He got ahead in the count 
and at 3-and-2 Harv gave him two fastballs, right down the middle. He fouled 
both off. It was a very good at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
A good at-bat that ended badly for Harvey and the Angels. The 202nd and final 
pitch Friday was a fastball that bounced in the dirt in front of home plate for 
the fourth walk of the inning, bringing home Cecil Fielder with the winning run 
in the Tigers' 2-1 decision over the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to give Fielder, the major league home run leader, anything juicy 
to hit, Harvey kept the ball away. His first two pitches landed in the dirt in 
a four-pitch walk; Dave Bergman worked out a full-count walk and Lloyd Moseby 
had a 3-1 edge in the count before he walked. Harvey (2-2) dodged defeat once 
when he struck out Lou Whitaker on a 3-2 pitch, but he tempted fate once too 
often with Lusader. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having trouble controlling everything," Harvey said disgustedly. "I just 
stunk it up. There ain't no excuses. You should never walk four guys in an 
inning, no matter what. You've got to make an adjustment somewhere and I 
couldn't do it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
It was an ironic ending for the Angels, who had the bases loaded on walks with 
two out in the top of the 10th inning and were themselves one ball away from 
scoring the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Nunez had walked Jack Howell leading off the inning and passed Devon 
White intentionally. Dante Bichette struck out, but Donnie Hill walked, 
bringing up Wally Joyner. Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson called on left-hander 
Jerry Don Gleaton to face the left-handed Joyner, who got ahead in the count 
3-and-1. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, however, swung and missed at a pitch that was high, then grounded 
easily to short. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a ball," Joyner said. "Maybe the worst ball he threw me in the inning. 
Or the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader noticed that, too. "The difference in the ballgame was 
they took a ball and we didn't," he said. "They got away with it and we 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels (31-31) dropped 10 games behind Oakland and are tied for third place 
with the Minnesota Twins (30-30) in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's 3-hour 47-minute exercise began with two sterling performances by the 
starters. Angel left-hander Mark Langston struck out 11 in eight innings, his 
30th double-digit strikeout effort in the American League and 35th of his 
career. He held the Tigers hitless until Alan Trammell singled sharply to 
center with one out in the sixth. With Lance Parrish's second-inning leadoff 
homer against former Angel Dan Petry his only offensive support, Langston 
protected that lead until the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing very well," Parrish said. "The pitches they hit were really 
not bad pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Moseby led off the seventh with a walk and was on the move when Ed Romero 
dumped a soft single to center. The ball curved away from White and glanced off 
his fingertips, allowing Moseby to score the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a fine job," Rader said of Petry, who signed a minor league contract 
with the Tigers after the Angels released him. "He's got a lot of friends on 
this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Langston had gotten out of a sixth-inning fix that developed when Fielder 
followed Trammell's single with a double off the glove of left fielder Luis 
Polonia, striking out Jim Lindeman and Tracy Jones to preserve his shutout. He 
couldn't do the same in the seventh, which left him shrugging his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"I go out and just try to keep the game close. That's my job," said Langston, 
who has a 4-6 record and one victory in his past six starts. "You throw zeroes 
for (seven) innings, there's a pretty good chance that's going to get you a 
win." 
</P>
<P>
He moved into second place on the AL strikeout list with 86, behind the 96 
recorded by Boston's Roger Clemens. He has struck out 58 batters in his last 
seven starts but is 2-3 with two no-decisions in that span. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be second in wins, or first in wins, instead of strikeouts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That the Angels didn't win Friday sat heavily on Harvey. His elbow, tender last 
week, was no problem. He felt ready. "Before, when I was scuffling, it was my 
mechanics and everything," he said. "Tonight, everything was fine. I just 
didn't do what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish celebrated his 34th birthday Friday by hitting his 11th home run, 
off Dan Petry. It brought a roar of approval from the Tiger Stadium crowd of 
21,252, who remember his 10 years with the club. "That was kind of nice," 
Parrish said of the ovation. But he found it difficult to look at Petry, a 
former teammate and still a friend. "I figured if I made eye contact, it might 
make me lose my concentration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eichhorn, who pitched the ninth inning, made 29 pitches -- and 23 throws 
to first to hold runners. Seventeen were after Lloyd Moseby had singled, and 
the last picked him off. . . . The Angels are 3-4 in extra innings and 9-9 in 
one-run games. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White hit in the ninth spot in the lineup Friday. White is hitting .210 
and has six hits in his last 36 at-bats. "This is a big center field and we 
want him there to play defense," Doug Rader said. "Right now, he's not hitting 
well enough to hit anywhere else." . . . Sparky Anderson hasn't forgotten 
Parrish. He laughingly praised Parrish's skill in turning a double play while 
playing first base Wednesday. "How you doing, Silk?" Anderson said. "We've got 
to call you 'Silk' now."

MORNING BRIEFING: OLD KNICKS KNEW HOW TO FLATTEN AN OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Phil Jackson of the Chicago Bulls told the Chicago Tribune that when he 
played for the New York Knicks in the early 1970s, the Knicks customarily let 
some air out of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a short team and didn't want long rebounds," Jackson said of the 
Knicks, who won NBA championships in 1970 and 1973 with a cast that included 
Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Dave DeBusschere and Bill Bradley. "It also helped 
our offense because we liked to pass the ball, and other teams couldn't run on 
us as well because the ball wouldn't come up as fast when they dribbled." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Heat tried the same tactic this season to slow down the Bulls, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The balls were so soft, you could stick your thumb in them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson foiled the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I always carry an air-pressure gauge with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who finished second in the 200 meters at the Mexico City Olympics 
in 1968, when Tommie Smith and John Carlos of the United States finished first 
and third? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome aboard, Chris: Said Kevin McHale of the Boston Celtics, before it was 
announced this week that Chris Ford had been hired to replace Jimmy Rodgers as 
the Celtics' coach: "Anyone who thinks a new coach will take care of our 
problems, well, that's a lot of bull. A new coach won't make us younger, 
quicker or better ballhandlers." 
</P>
<P>
40-40 vision: Trying to track down injured Jose Canseco at a San Francisco 
hospital this week, columnist Dave Newhouse of the Oakland Tribune ran into 
Canseco's wife, Esther, who told Newhouse: 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing better than I thought he would. I didn't think he could handle it. 
I thought it would be like last year (when he missed most of the season with a 
wrist injury). But he's fine now. The only thing he said is, 'I'm going to miss 
a week -- I'm going to miss hitting three home runs.' That's what he has been 
averaging, three homers a week." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, on the 15-day disabled list with a back problem, actually will miss 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Or, by his count, six homers. 
</P>
<P>
Just add oil: Speaking of Nolan Ryan's longevity, former major league pitcher 
Sam McDowell, a psychologist and substance-abuse counselor for the Texas 
Rangers, told Newsday: "If you were to take motion pictures of his windup and 
his delivery compared to anybody else in baseball, you'd find he has the most 
non-frictional windup and delivery of any pitcher I've ever seen. It's just a 
smooth machine where the entire body flows together to get the ball to where he 
wants it to be. Good mechanics is what stops injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nice Guy: Michael Lloyd, a photographer for the Portland Oregonian, said 
that he was run over by Bill Laimbeer of the Detroit Pistons while trying to 
get a photo of the Pistons running onto the floor for Game 2 of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was about six feet out onto the court at Detroit's end, and all of a sudden, 
I was flying through the air," Lloyd said. "I didn't know what hit me. I landed 
on my back and got some pretty bad bumps and bruises." 
</P>
<P>
Said Steve Nehl, another Oregonian photographer who witnessed the incident: 
"Laimbeer came at Mike with his forearms up and just ran right through him." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Peter Norman of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Catcher John Russell of the Texas Rangers, who was recalled from the 
minors last month and had never played in a game with Nolan Ryan before last 
Monday, when Ryan pitched a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics: "That look 
of determination in his eyes the last few innings -- that was the most 
determined I've ever seen a man." JERRY CROWE

DODGERS SHOULD CENTER ATTENTION ON BULLPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has come to my attention that the Dodgers have four center fielders (Gibson, 
Gonzalez, Javier and Gwynn). Since Fred Claire doesn't believe in buying or 
trading for quality relief pitchers, maybe some of the center fielders should 
be given a chance in the bullpen.

WHAT KIND OF ROLE MODEL IS THIS FOR THE CHILDREN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter . . . big deal. If he were a real baseball player, 
he'd have several illegitimate children, a drug/alcohol/gambling problem or a 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about his bionic pitching arm. But what about a man that 
characterizes what a superstar figure should be -- a polite family man who 
knows how to stay out of trouble.

GOLF ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNSON, ERRATIC STEINHAUER LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Johnson birdied three of the five par-three holes en route to a 
three-under-par 67 Friday and shared the second-round lead with Sherri 
Steinhauer in a $300,000 LPGA tournament at Somers Point, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, looking for her first victory since 1987, and Steinhauer, a non-winner 
in four-plus years on the LPGA Tour, were a contrast in styles. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 32, was steady, not making a bogey in reaching the halfway point at 
four-under 136. Steinhauer, 27, had six birdies, including five in a row early 
in a round of two-under-par 68, but also had four bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the fourth time this year that a player has made five birdies in a 
row. The tour record is eight, set by Mary Beth Zimmerman in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, Johnson was also tied for the lead, with Vicki Fergon. Johnson 
eventually finished tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back here and having good memories helps," Johnson said. "I seem to 
think well on this course. It suits my game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to consciously change the way I play. I'm just going to go out 
and try to play my game." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Eggeling, who reached six under midway through the round, faltered down 
the stretch with a double bogey and two bogeys and finished tied with Lenore 
Rittenhouse, two shots behind the leaders. Eggeling had a second-round 71 and 
Rittenhouse a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Nancy Lopez, looking for her first victory of the year, was 
three strokes behind the leaders, tied with Beth Daniel, a two-time winner this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Hendrickson's eagle gave him a seven-under 65 and the first-round lead in 
the $400,000 Senior PGA Tour event at Syracuse for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
He sank a three-foot putt for an eagle on the par-five eighth hole, leaving him 
one shot ahead of Mike Hill, who was tied for the lead but bogeyed the final 
hole after landing in a bunker on his approach shot. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Hill at 66 were defending champion Jim Dent, Walter Zembriski and Larry 
Mowry. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Nichols was two strokes behind at 67, despite consecutive bogeys on the 
11th and 12th holes. Bill Collins was also at five under. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson, who has never won a senior tour event, led for 52 of 54 holes last 
year at the Lafayette Country Club before being overtaken by Dent. 
</P>
<P>
The leader was first off the 6,540-yard, par-72 course, but trailed Hill by a 
stroke before an eagle on the par-five eighth hole. Hendrickson left his second 
shot just short of the cup with a two-iron. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who had five birdies in a six-hole stretch, led after 12 holes. Starting 
on the back nine, Hill was one-under after four holes, but came back with 
birdies on No. 16 and No. 17, both par fives. 
</P>
<P>
He parred on the next hole, then started the front nine with three consecutive 
birdies. Hill, also looking for his first tour win, added his eighth birdie of 
the day on No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols was the early leader, with birdies on five of his first 10 holes. But 
the 1964 PGA champion fell back into the pack with consecutive bogeys. He 
finished with birdies on the 14th and 16th. 
</P>
<P>
Dent shot a steady round with six birdies, including three in a row on the 
14th, 15th and 16th holes. Dent, known as a long hitter, birdied just two of 
the course's five par-five holes. 
</P>
<P>
American Rick Hartmann shot his second consecutive 66 to keep a share of the 
lead after two rounds of a European PGA tournament at Rickmansworth, England. 
</P>
<P>
Hartmann and England's Peter Mitchell were at 12-under-par 132, two ahead of 
American Bill Malley and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie.

A'S RALLY DENIES WHITE SOX FIRST PLACE, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surprising Chicago White Sox were all set to take over first place in the 
American League West Friday night to the delight of 40,417 fans at Comiskey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, boasting the most effective bullpen in the league, had built a 
4-1 lead through seven innings. Furthermore, the Athletics were without 
slugging Jose Canseco, and Mark McGwire, though playing, wasn't swinging with 
authority because of a chest injury. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Greg Hibbard had given up only four hits and appeared to have the 
slumping World Series champions at his mercy. 
</P>
<P>
There was no cause for concern even when Mike Gallego and Walt Weiss opened the 
eighth inning with singles. In came Barry Jones, who was 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Henderson, who homered earlier, doubled in two runs and Terry 
Steinbach singled in two more and suddenly, the Athletics had a 5-4 victory and 
a two-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising made a 10-game winner out of Bob Welch, who had one of his poorest 
outings. Welch (10-2) won his seventh in a row, though he barely survived the 
first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Welch issued five walks in the first three innings, fell behind, 3-1, and never 
did look the part of a winner. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox scored one run while hitting into a double play, another on a 
wild pitch and the third on a passed ball. They scored another run in the 
seventh when Ivan Calderon singled, Dan Pasqua walked and Carlton Fisk singled 
to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
If the White Sox had won their second in a row from the Athletics, they would 
have led by five percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Before Dennis Eckersley got the final out for his 21st save in 22 
opportunities, Gene Nelson and Rick Honeycutt followed Welch to the hill. 
Eckersley gave up a bunt single to Calderon before getting Pasqua on a grounder 
to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Until the winning rally, the Athletics had been unable to capitalize on their 
chances. They left 10 runners stranded in the first six innings of Thursday's 
3-2 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
They had runners on second and third with one out in the second, but two 
brilliant plays by Chicago third baseman Robin Ventura prevented any runs from 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, New York 4 -- The Blue Jays, leading the East, decided to give third 
baseman Kelly Gruber a night off at New York. 
</P>
<P>
But with the bases loaded, two out in the eighth inning and the Yankees 
leading, 3-1, Manager Cito Gaston summoned Gruber to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber tripled to left-center to put the Blue Jays in front and enable them to 
stay 1 1/2 games ahead of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The victory went to David Wells (5-1), though he appeared to be on his way to a 
defeat. Tom Henke gave up a run in the bottom of the eighth, but still earned 
his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Baltimore 3 -- Without Wade Boggs and Marty Barrett, the Red Sox have 
to scratch for runs. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Baltimore, it was Danny Heep who came through. Heep, batting 
.178, hit a two-run double in the second inning to give the Red Sox the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Gardner, who can't beat anyone else, is a perfect 5-0 against the Orioles. 
Gardner (1-3) gave up two runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings to win. He also 
lowered his earned-run average from 7.79 to 6.65. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should only pitch against the Orioles," said Gardner, whose lifetime 
record is 16-22. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Harnisch (6-3) faced 15 batters and threw 60 pitches before leaving after 
1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Milwaukee 3 -- A promotion-night crowd of 63,546 at Cleveland -- 
-- largest in the majors this season -- -- cheered Tom Candiotti (7-3) to his 
second win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
An oil company promotion, in which free tickets were given for fillups, 
accounted for the big crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Candiotti gave up seven hits before Doug Jones took over with one out in the 
ninth. Jones retired the last two Brewers for his 21st save in 23 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Browne and Candy Maldonado hit run-scoring doubles in the first inning to 
spoil the Milwaukee debut of former Dodger Dennis Powell. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Minnesota 1 -- The only team playing worse than the Royals these 
days is the Twins. Kansas City took advantage of Minnesota's slump to win its 
second in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Tartabull hit a three-run home run and Kevin Appier held the Twins, who 
lost their eighth in a row, to five hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson doubled home a run in the fourth when the Royals jumped to a 2-0 
lead against rookie Tim Drummond (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull's home run in the fifth was a 410-foot blast and was his third in the 
last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 4, Seattle 3 -- Manager Bobby Valentine had run out of relief pitchers, 
so he told Kevin Brown he had to go the distance at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Brown (8-4) managed to go all the way, but just barely. He gave up seven hits 
and the Mariners scored a run in the ninth and had the potential tying run on 
second when center fielder Gary Pettis made the final putout. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia drove in two runs for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Brown cooled off hot-hitting Ken Griffey Jr., who went 0 for four and dropped 
below .333 for the first time this season. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MAGADAN USES HIS BAT TO VENT ANGER, POWERS METS PAST PIRATES, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets' Dave Magadan, angered when he was left out of the lineup 
Thursday night for the game that was eventually rained out at Pittsburgh, took 
it out on the Pirates Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan went four for four, including two doubles, in the Mets' 7-5 victory, 
which also featured a three-run home run in the first inning by Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who came out of a season-long batting slump during a three-game 
series in Chicago, scored their fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
They hammered Walt Terrell and three relievers for 14 hits and took a 7-2 lead 
in the fourth inning. In their last four games the Mets have scored 50 runs and 
had 71 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan, a left-handed hitter, felt he had played a prominent part in getting 
the Mets out of their slump. He went four for four in a 19-8 rout in the first 
of the three games at Chicago. For the three games, he was nine for 16 and 
drove in seven runs. But with left-hander Bob Patterson pitching, Tim Teufel 
was penciled in at first base Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan let new Met Manager Bud Harrelson know how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan told Marty Noble of Newsday, "Last week when he (Harrelson) started 
(Tom) O'Malley over me, he said he wanted to go with the hot hand. 
</P>
<P>
"On that basis I should have been in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Magadan singled in the first inning Friday night to start the rally that 
Strawberry capped with his 13th home run. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning Magadan doubled in a run to cap a four-run burst. He has 
12 hits in his last 18 at-bats and is hitting .387. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan thought he had a regular job late last season, but was back to utility 
status after the Mets obtained slugger Mike Marshall from the Dodgers. Marshall 
is sidelined because of the same back problem that hampered his Dodger career 
and Magadan is making the most of it -- -- when Harrelson lets him. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, meanwhile, is hitting .431 with eight home runs and 18 runs batted 
in his last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ojeda (3-3) gave up nine hits and four runs in 6 1/3 innings. John Franco, 
who retired the last five batters, picked up his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have won nine of their last 11, including four out of five over the 
Pirates, and are six games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 6, Houston 3 -- Paul O'Neill went four for four, drove in three runs 
and scored another to lead the leaders of the West to their third consecutive 
victory, at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Although he struggled and needed help from Randy Myers in the eighth, Jack 
Armstrong (9-3) ended the Astros' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong gave up nine hits and three earned runs and his league-leading 
earned-run average increased to 1.99. However, he helped with the bat. His 
second hit of the season was a bases-loaded single in the third inning that 
drove in the first two runs of his career. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Atlanta 2 -- The Braves' Pete Smith apparently escaped serious 
injury at San Francisco when he was hit in the head by a line drive off the bat 
of the Giants' Terry Kennedy in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was hospitalized for observation after needing four stitches to close a 
cut above his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
After Smith was hit, the ball bounced into the outfield and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Thompson hit a three-run home run for the Giants, who have won 15 of 
their last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
John Burkett (7-1) went eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, St. Louis 4 -- With his bullpen ace Lee Smith suffering from a sore 
shoulder and his other relievers pitching poorly, Manager Whitey Herzog tried 
to coax Joe Magrane to a complete-game victory at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane (3-9) entered the ninth inning with a 3-1 lead, but he didn't get 
anyone out and two singles, a double, a walk and a triple by Dave Martinez gave 
Montreal the lead. Scott Terry then gave up a home run to Nelson Santovenia and 
the Expos had their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth loss in a row for the Cardinals. In the last three losses, 
they have had a lead going into the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6-7, Chicago 5-0 -- The Cubs lost their second doubleheader in 
three days and saw their losing streak hit five games, at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, rookie outfielder Jim Vatcher from Cal State Northridge, singled 
in the winning run in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Ruffin pitched a three-hitter and held Ryne Sandberg hitless in the 
second game. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg had two hits in the opener to extend his hitting streak to 11 games, a 
span during which he was 22 for 46. DAN HAFNER

DOW UP 7.67 TO 2,935.89, A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH 
</P>

<P>
Blue chip stocks closed at record highs Friday after gaining support from 
last-minute book squaring related to the "triple-witching" expirations of June 
stock-index futures and options. 
</P>
<P>
"Expirations trading was set up for selling on the opening and buying on the 
close," said S. G. Warburg analyst Ken Ducey. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks rose 7.67 points to close at 
2,935.89, just barely topping its previous closing peak of 2,935.19 reached on 
June 4. 
</P>
<P>
For the week, the index posted a gain of 73.51 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 611 up, 835 
down and 552 unchanged. Big Board volume came to 205.13 million shares, up from 
135.77 million Thursday and the heaviest since 225.41 million on May 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a quiet close-out and mainly in the major market index-related stocks," 
said Donald Selkin, head of index futures research at Prudential-Bache 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The major market index, which comprises 20 stocks, mimics the Dow index. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp drop in bonds had hurt stocks at the beginning of the session. The bond 
market was reacting to a modest 0.2% rise in May consumer prices, and more 
significantly to a pickup in industrial activity in May. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, stocks seemed to show little reaction to the economic 
reports. Some financial stocks fell, continuing the recent downtrend, but 
elsewhere investors just seemed to pick and choose. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the Dow higher were Chevron, up 1 1/2 to 72; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1 
1/8 to 84 3/8, and GM, up 5/8 to 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas lost another 3/4 to 38 5/8 as a Smith Barney analyst repeated 
his sell suggestion. Northrop fell 1/2 to 18 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Oil service stocks gained. Baker Hughes added 3/4 to 28 3/4 and Halliburton 
jumped 1 3/8 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
Among recently battered S&amp;Ls, HomeFed dropped 1/2 to 23 1/2 and CalFed gave 
up 3/8 to 19 1/2. But some bank stocks rose, including Wells Fargo, up 1 1/4 to 
79 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. climbed 2 3/4 to 131 3/4 amid intense attention on the opening 
of the film "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Wahlco Environmental of San Diego plunged 2 3/4 to 10 3/8 after saying that 
several orders for its flue gas-conditioning systems were likely to be delayed, 
hurting earnings by about 10 cents a share in the current year. The company 
went public this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, depressed precious-metals stocks staged a modest rally along with 
the price of gold. ASA Ltd. gained 1 to 44, Homestake Mining rose 5/8 to 16 3/8 
and Newmont Gold jumped 1 5/8 to 38 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices closed lower in sluggish trading as investors became 
discouraged by the yen's sharp fall and retreated to the sidelines. The blue 
chip Nikkei 225-share index lost 129.71 points to end the week at 32,538.40. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks were depressed by a weak start on Wall Street. At the close, 
the Financial Times 100-share index was down 10.7 points at 2,392.3. In 
Frankfurt, West Germany, the DAX index ended a quiet trading session just 4.87 
points higher at 1,792.26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Speculation About Rates Sinks Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices tumbled on economic reports that led traders to conclude the 
Federal Reserve won't lower interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
In its sharpest one-day drop since mid-April, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year 
bond tumbled 13/16 point, or $8.13 per $1,000 in face amount. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to 8.42% from late Wednesday's 
8.34%, which was the lowest for the long-term bond since late January. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said they were surprised at the sharp drop, which came despite the 
news on inflation and the U.S. trade deficit that normally would boost bond 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
They attributed the bulk of the decline to a Fed report that industrial 
production rebounded an unexpectedly strong 0.6% last month after holding 
steady in April. The market had expected a 0.3% rise. 
</P>
<P>
Despite intense Bush Administration pressure to lower interest rates, many 
analysts now believe that the Fed will keep rates level in a continuing battle 
against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, same as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Mixed in Heavy Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost ground in domestic dealings and finished mixed in Europe in 
volatile trading. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar initially rallied, both in Europe and the United States, on the 
notion that the Federal Reserve won't be inclined to lower interest rates to 
stimulate production. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities 
less attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
But a bout of profit taking swept European markets, where the dollar closed 
lower against most currencies, and carried through to U.S. dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Activity was "very heavy and very choppy," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice 
president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.52 yen, up 0.99 yen from Thursday. Later in 
London, the dollar was quoted lower at 154.10 yen. In New York, the dollar 
closed at 153.90 yen, down from 154.20. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices advanced but were unable to recover from Thursday's $5-an-ounce 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
settled at $349.50 an ounce, up $2.70 from late Thursday. Republic National 
Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $348.50, up $2.65. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Orange Juice Prices Take Bad Beating 
</P>
<P>
Orange juice futures prices collapsed, reflecting weak demand, a larger 
government estimate of the Florida crop and unsubstantiated rumors of Brazilian 
price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, pork futures plunged while cattle futures were 
mixed; energy futures were mixed, and grains and soybeans fell. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 5 to 10.65 cents lower, with 
the contract for delivery in July down 10.65 cents at $1.795 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff followed a Florida Citrus Department report Thursday that U.S. 
consumption of non-concentrated orange juice was about 15% below a year ago 
during the four weeks ending April 21.

Re: Claire Simpson's letter in Calendar (June 3) regarding the automatic 
renewal of Hollywood Bowl boxes in which she argued that this practice should

This is no different from season tickets at any theater.

For 10 years we enjoyed the Playboy Jazz Festival and looked forward each year 
to our box for this concert. Then someone got the brainy idea to offer the 
boxes in a lottery. Since then, we have not attended a Playboy concert.

CARTOON OPERAS

<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Bernheimer's review ("Some Sonic Sendak at the Music Center," June 9) of 
the two cartoonish operas current at the Music Center Opera, "Higglety-Pigglety 
Pop!" and "Where the Wild Things Are," while typically (for Bernheimer) snide 
and oh-so superior, misses what I consider the main objection to this 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Lest I create the impression I am a wizened reactionary, let me say that I'm in 
my mid-30s and a relative newcomer to opera. But this season I did not purchase 
season tickets. I have no interest in cartoons to music or tired musicals. Los 
Angeles for many years had no indigenous professional opera. Now that we do, 
couldn't they stick to the real thing?

FOOT IN THE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In all the recent published material on the National Endowment for the Arts 
mess, one significant fact, which probably served as an opening wedge for the 
newly proposed grant restrictions, has gone unnoticed. In 1989, when I received 
a Visual Arts Grant, I had to sign an oath that I would not use, manufacture or 
sell illegal drugs during the grant year. 
</P>
<P>
When I won the same award in 1983, that provision was not there. 
</P>
<P>
So I signed it. I mean, how often do you get a chance to cripple the Colombian 
drug cartel and rid America of all its dope-fiend artists by simply affixing

But the proverbial camel had shoved its snoot under the nation's art tent. This 
year, our increasingly reactionary officialdom ups the ante with new 
restrictions -- condemning artists who deal with sexuality and religion in 
"socially irresponsible" ways. 
</P>
<P>
What next, if this trend in the art world goes unchecked? The demand for 
political orthodoxy, of course. And remember, societal repression generally 
begins with the creative community. Who would define "politically correct"? 
Whoever has the power, is who. For society and the artist, it really wouldn't 
matter.

FACES . . . : REILLY'S MONOPOLY ON COCKINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Listen up, all you starving actors waiting for that big break: Mike Reilly has 
some advice for anyone tired of the old adage, "You just have to be in the 
right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
"You get so sick of hearing that," Reilly commiserates. This is a guy who knows 
of what he speaks. A month ago, the 26-year-old actor from Florida was waiting 
tables in Orange County. Tonight, he makes his national TV debut as host of 
ABC's Merv Griffin-produced "Monopoly" -- a classic big break, which even 
Reilly calls amazing. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly's rise to potential game-show stardom came about after he appeared as a 
contestant on "Jeopardy!" -- presumably to bolster his waiter's salary. "I won 
Lee Press-on Nails and a canned ham," he jokes. "No, actually, I took home some 
lovely parting gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Worth more than the camcorder and Nintendo set, though, was the impression 
Reilly made on the show's producers, who asked him to come back as a contestant 
for the "Monopoly" pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said he wanted to play host. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," he says, "when Merv let me host the show that first 
time, he wanted to hang me because I was so cocky." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, though, they liked Reilly's cockiness and sense of humor. "If you 
give people the right energy, you can infuse the room with a mood," he says of 
his ability as a host. "Of course, if we need an icebreaker, I can always drop 
my pants or something." 
</P>
<P>
Reilly insists that the events of the last few weeks haven't changed him 
("Don't be deceived," he says. "I was always cocky"), nor does he fear for his 
future or the future of the show. "With all the support they're giving the 
show, it's like playing for Notre Dame," he says. "The only variable is me -- 
I'm the only one who can screw up." 
</P>
<P>
As for that advice to other starving actors? "It's true," he says. "You just 
have to be at the right place at the right time." LAUREN LIPTON

U.S. military experts will travel to Malaysia soon to find out if a collection 
of skeletons -- said to be remains of American servicemen killed in Vietnam -- 
are indeed those of humans, a Pentagon spokesman said in Washington. The 
remains and 28 U.S. Army identification tags were found on a boat carrying nine 
Vietnamese men that landed Monday in a southeastern coastal village in 
Malaysia. There is some speculation that the Vietnamese, possibly desperate to 
resettle in the United States, may have used the MIA ploy to induce U.S. 
authorities to grant them refuge.

A private school building collapsed in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, killing at least 
23 students and injuring 60, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were digging through the collapsed structure for 15 other students 
feared trapped in the rubble. The accident occurred as about 200 students 
gathered for a debate on the third floor of the building, which was still under 
construction, said one survivor. Many were trapped on a stairwell when they 
tried to flee as the walls began collapsing.

The Iranian government has banned the country's only remaining legal opposition 
party after arresting eight of its members, an exiled Iranian group said in 
reports monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. The reported actions against the Freedom 
Movement signal the final crushing of any organized domestic opposition to the 
cleric-led government, the sources said. A ruling by the revolutionary 
prosecutor in Tehran declared the group illegal, according to Ali Safavi, 
spokesman in Baghdad for the Moujahedeen or Holy Warriors, an Iranian 
opposition group based in Iraq.

Bush Administration officials told a Senate committee they oppose trade 
sanctions against Iraq despite its "abysmal" human rights record and its use of 
chemical weapons, saying such measures would hurt U.S. farmers more than the 
Baghdad government. Both Democratic and Republican members of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee reacted angrily to the Administration position. 
Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said Amnesty International reports that 
Iraq has tortured and executed children left her in tears, and that just 
because U.S. sanctions might not work is no reason not to give them a try.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wellford Wilms came back to the assembly line the other day, to the spot where 
he'd put thousands of right rear interior door handles on Toyota Corollas and 
Geo Prizms. The men and women on the line greeted him warmly with hugs and 
jokes. It would have made a great beer commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Except that Wilms isn't a retired auto worker. He's a prematurely gray 
professor in UCLA's Graduate School of Education who decided to learn about how 
a plant works by working there himself. 
</P>
<P>
Wilms and a team of a half-dozen graduate students, who combined spent 600 
hours working on various parts of the New United Motors Manufacturing Inc.'s 
assembly line, are engaged in a novel study of how industries shift to the 
much-vaunted "cooperative" system of management. This system, which stresses 
teamwork and heightened employee participation over traditional authoritarian 
rule, is routinely hailed as a cure for lagging productivity and quality. 
</P>
<P>
The team system is supposed to improve production by holding workers 
accountable for quality, minor maintenance and cleanup on the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Within that comfortable abstraction, however, lurks a myriad of tiny human 
conflicts that even the most progressive companies are still struggling to 
resolve, the researchers have found. Scraping away the residue of generations 
of adversarial relationships between bosses and workers is harder than it 
looks, particularly in a world where variables such as technology and 
competition change so swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers' work, conducted in boots and helmets and with unlimited access 
to the factory floor, has plunged them into the heart of America's industrial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
They have been able to see, on one hand, how New United Motors, a 
Toyota-General Motors joint venture, breaks scores of rules that have 
traditionally limited workers' involvement in the affairs of management. A 
union leader marvels at being able to attend company meetings with suppliers, 
where he is able to ask questions as a member of the management team, no longer 
an adversary. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the researchers have seen the crankiness that developed 50 
miles to the north in Pittsburg when a steel plant run as a Korean-American 
joint venture embarked on a modernization program requiring more initiative 
from its veteran work force. 
</P>
<P>
There, the local steelworkers union president still boycotts classes on a 
quality-improvement system to retaliate for what he describes as management's 
violation of labor contract language. And a company executive frets over having 
to tell candidates for promotion that they now have to be "team players," and 
that "by the way, being a dominant leader isn't part of it any more." 
</P>
<P>
Wilms and his team are focusing on six California plants that are trying to 
change the way work is done. 
</P>
<P>
By varying degrees, all of the companies have bought in to the notion that 
supervisors can draw better work out of employees by adopting the 
production-team approach that is loosely known as "Japanese-style mangement." 
The shift to this production system affects not only the estimated 300,000 
Americans who work for Japanese-owned companies in the United States, but 
millions more whose companies are copying some components. About 5% of American 
companies operate with a truly collaborative management systems, according to 
one recent national study. 
</P>
<P>
Working microcosmically, dissecting the day-to-day mechanics of production, 
Wilms and his students are trying to answer big, intimidating questions: What 
human dynamics are most important in making collaborative systems work? Do 
these systems really increase quality? How are problems solved so that emphasis 
is put on correcting problems rather than assessing blame? Do schools have to 
change so that students learn not only technical skills but an appreciation of 
interdependence in a continuous production system? 
</P>
<P>
Issues such as the low educational level of workers, so often decried as a 
national crisis, came into human focus for the researchers. At the USS-POSCO 
steel plant in Pittsburg, a joint venture between USX, formerly United States 
Steel Corp., and the Korean Pohang Iron and Steel Co., they found that a 
read-out dial in the control room of one of the plant's new steel preparation 
lines had to be simplified because some workers were confused by the concept of 
negative numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, that change was devised not by a manager but by a worker who had 
gone through retraining and later boasted to one researcher, "I learned I was 
smart." 
</P>
<P>
Scores of studies have been performed on cooperative management in recent 
years, but they focused on executive opinion or questionnaires handed to 
workers. By contrast, the two-year UCLA study is an exercise in cultural 
anthropology. The researchers are trying to describe how people respond to 
changes in the workplace by living their subjects' on-the-job lives and 
interviewing them over a prolonged period. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has sat down as far as we could tell and tried to measure what happens 
when American companies try to use" cooperative management, said Robert 
Monagan, a former Speaker of the state Assembly and president of the California 
Economic Development Corp., a business advisory group created by the Deukmejian 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA study, which may cost up to $375,000 by the time it is completed, is 
itself a cooperative venture. A collection of business, labor and state 
government officials are sponsoring and helping to finance it. Company 
presidents and labor leaders at the firms under study sit on the board of the 
California Worksite Research Committee, created by Wilms. Researchers share 
preliminary conclusions with their subjects in exchange for permission to peer 
into virtually every nook and cranny. 
</P>
<P>
Wilms' team alternated between working and interviewing workers and managers 
during the several months they spent at the Fremont auto plant. They are 
currently finishing their study at the Pittsburg steel plant, where the more 
dangerous nature of the work limited them to interviewing rather than running 
equipment. From there, they plan to move on to McDonnell Douglas's Long Beach 
subsidiary, Douglas Aircraft, which last year drastically reorganized its 
management system, forcing 5,000 managers to quit and rehiring only the 4,000 
who passed personality tests geared to measure "team-player" qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The study is the brainchild of Benson Munger, a staff member on the state 
Senate Industrial Relations Committee and an eager student of Japanese culture, 
who began urging Wilms as early as 1982 to analyze cooperative management. 
</P>
<P>
Munger is a strong advocate of labor-management cooperation, but he recognizes 
that cultural differences make it stressful for American companies to institute 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an existing sense of obligation between workers and managers in 
Japan," he said. "Here, since labor and management have never been close, that 
coming together is what makes the cooperative model stressful. . . . All the 
skills people need today have changed." 
</P>
<P>
It took Wilms, Munger and the rest of the team nearly four years to get 
permission to study New United Motors, which had been cool to outside 
researchers since it was established in 1984 in a GM plant that had been shut 
down in 1982. New United Motors -- clean, well-lit, where employee suggestion 
boxes are jammed and workers on all levels are held rigorously accountable -- 
is often held up as heaven by proponents of industrial progress. It remains an 
assembly plant, however, where work is broken down into 60-second bites and 
life can take on a sameness that is numbing but still valuable at $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was scared to death just learning a job," Wilms said. "I'd never 
worked on a production line before except for a summer in a cherry cannery in 
high school. What an iron horse it is." 
</P>
<P>
If New United Motors is an iron horse, the USS-POSCO assembly line is a rusted 
one. Parts of the plant look as if they haven't been touched since the 1950s, 
while other sections, completed last year under the joint venture with the 
South Koreans, feature the latest technology for milling American and imported 
steel to various thicknesses. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture represented USX's acknowledgement that it could no longer 
compete against the South Koreans. The plant's 900 workers, many of them with 
15 or more years' experience, accepted wage cuts and more flexible work rules 
in their last contract. In return, the company promised to invest its wage 
savings in worker retraining. About 150 workers were sent to West Germany, 
France, Japan and South Korea to train on up-to-date equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Jelling the old and the new -- employees, equipment, methodology -- has been 
painful. Management has trouble translating its goals through supervisors. 
National union leaders have trouble translating their support for the new 
practices to the rank-and-file. New United Motors had the advantage of starting 
up new, recalling the old work force; USS-POSCO has to discover the future 
while simultaneously producing the day's load. 
</P>
<P>
"We're neophytes," says Randy Smith, vice president of employee relations at 
the Pittsburg plant and a veteran of 39 years with the company. "This is a long 
process. I don't think we'll get to where we should be during my tenure." 
</P>
<P>
In some sections of the plant, workers are using calculators for the first time 
in their lives. Managers no longer wear white safety helmets -- like everyone 
else, they now wear orange ones -- but the division is still felt. Workers 
object to the absence of consistent shifts; they are rotated constantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We still use levers (of obstruction) against each other," said Joe Stanton, 
president of the union local, who came to California from Pennsylvania's 
Monongahela Valley when the steel industry there went bust in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton, a plant electrician, has benefited from the joint venture's 
unprecedented emphasis on employee training. He was able to go to school for 
several months to upgrade his skills. 
</P>
<P>
"This time we gave up money and got something," he said, referring to the wage 
concessions and the training. "It ain't in my pocket, but it's in my mind."

CHINA'S JIANG ANSWERS LETTER FROM CAL POLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When nine Cal Poly Pomona students wrote to China's top Communist last March 
seeking an explanation for last year's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy 
protesters in Beijing, what they expected was a form letter in reply. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they were invited to the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles on Friday to 
receive an extraordinarily detailed, 10-page answer from Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Communist Party in China. 
</P>
<P>
The response, hand-delivered to them by Chinese Consul General Ma Yuzhen, 
amounted to a lengthy defense of the government's actions against what Jiang 
called "a handful of people . . . who whipped up the turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
While Jiang's letter included scant new information about the disturbances and 
crackdown of last summer or the Chinese government's policies, the very sending 
of such a response constituted a remarkable diplomatic gesture and was seen by 
its recipients as a clever public relations gambit. 
</P>
<P>
College campuses across the United States were hotbeds of protest against 
China's moves to crush the student-led pro-democracy demonstrations with a 
ferocity that shocked the world. Last March, the nine political science 
students were moved to write Jiang demanding an explanation for the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Their respectfully worded letter questioned, among other things, whether it was 
"the gloomy reminder that although the Communist Party presides in the name of 
the people, it only maintains its power by the sword." 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasant but well-choreographed ceremony at the Chinese Consulate, the 
students received their reply. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very surprised," said Valerie O'Regan, 33, a spokeswoman for the 
students, all of whom are enrolled in an upper-division course on Chinese 
government and politics. "We expected a general response of two, maybe three 
pages . . . or a form letter." 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Ma presented the letter to O'Regan, Victoria Engbarth, Jeffrey 
Jacks, Laura Brown and David Shui in a ceremony in his office. Students Steven 
N. Samuelian, Reggie Akenzua, Tom Payne and Shawn King were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Ma called Jiang's lengthy letter "a new beginning" in Sino-American relations 
at a time when the two countries "are undergoing a very difficult period." 
</P>
<P>
"We want dialogue, we want sincerity, and we want goodwill," he told reporters 
invited to the ceremony. "These are the most important elements in terms of 
repairing damaged relations between these two great countries." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald M. Peterson, chairman of Cal Poly's department of political science, 
however, dismissed the contents of the letter as "propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about friendship, but friendship is impossible without frankness, 
and frankness is impossible without a free press," Peterson said, moments 
before sharing a light lunch of vegetables, rice and flower wine with Chinese 
officials. "Without a free press, there is no hope." 
</P>
<P>
In his response to the students, Jiang covered topics ranging from the 
"disturbances that arose in Beijing in the spring-summer of 1989" to political 
reforms in his homeland and the future of socialism. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he declared, "We do not blame the students and the young people" 
for the government's decision to crush the Tian An Men Square demonstrations 
with force. 
</P>
<P>
"During the long protest period of 50 days, the government displayed maximum 
patience in the hope that a solution could be found in a democratic and legal 
manner," Jiang wrote. "However, the patience was seen as a sign of weakness. 
This, plus the divergent views emerging at the top leadership of our party, led 
to a delay in the action at a critical moment. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, Beijing was already in a state of anarchy, and some elements with 
criminal records surfaced again in society, posing the danger that such a 
phenomenon might spread across the country." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang also warned against viewing recent changes in Communist countries of 
Eastern Europe as a "setback in the course of socialist development." 
</P>
<P>
"One should not conclude from this that socialism has failed or collapsed," 
Jiang said. "A new system with innate vitality, the socialist system is not a 
weak system; it is capable of withstanding the test of frustration." 
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese saying goes," Jiang added, "A fall into the pit, a gain in your 
wit." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese proverbs aside, Cal Poly Prof. Marshall H. Shen said that, although 
Jiang's letter was "still very much at the level of generalities, I believe 
it's a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Ma, however, insisted that Jiang's words "clearly show that nothing will happen 
to those who demonstrated last year due to a misunderstanding" and that Chinese 
students in the United States should feel welcome to return to China and "take 
part in reforms." 
</P>
<P>
Ma said that 900 people arrested during the unapproved demonstrations last 
summer have been released from custody, proving his country's goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe more will be released," he said. "That is very positive." 
</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to estimate the number of people still detained or 
imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial estimates, 10,000 to 15,000 were detained nationwide at 
some point, but most have been released, State Department officials in 
Washington said. Chinese government figures leave hundreds of people 
unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can forgive anybody for that sort of violence against your 
own people," O'Regan said. "But we still don't know exactly what happened over 
there."

MILITARY TO BE SLASHED BY HALF IN NICARAGUA 
</P>

Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on Friday ordered her nation's 
military manpower cut to 41,000 by Aug. 3, about half the size of the army she 
inherited after ousting the Sandinistas in national elections. 
</P>
<P>
The troop reduction, which will bring Central America's largest army into line 
with those of its neighbors, comes as the last of the anti-Sandinista rebels 
are disarming under a peace treaty after eight years of war. The cuts were 
endorsed by Gen. Humberto Ortega, the Sandinista revolutionary who presided 
over the army's decade-long buildup and remains its commander. 
</P>
<P>
After making the announcement, Chamorro flew here to urge other Central 
American leaders to negotiate mutual troop reductions that would allow her to 
trim Nicaragua's army even further. The civilian presidents of five Central 
American countries and Panama meet here today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan officials said Chamorro had wanted an even sharper reduction than 
the one she announced. But they said she was obliged to accept troop levels 
close to those proposed by Ortega in order to maintain a rough balance of 
forces with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the cuts are dramatic because they will come so quickly. When Chamorro 
took office April 25, Ortega anticipated a gradual reduction -- to the same 
level but over an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential adviser Antonio Lacayo said that most of the soldiers cut will be 
draftees and militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the first 100 days of my government, the army will be reduced to fewer 
than 41,000 men and women, half the members it had April 25," Chamorro told an 
assembly of her Cabinet, the army high command, the Supreme Court and the 
diplomatic corps. 
</P>
<P>
"With this first great reduction of the military apparatus," she added, "I am 
ordering a restructuring of the army to adjust to the new situation of peace. 
This will imply a further reduction of the army's ranks, including officials of 
high rank. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of members the army will have at the end of the restructuring phase 
will depend in part on the future of the region. A Central America in peace, 
where all conflicts are resolved by dialogue, will not need armies, big or 
small," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials gathering here for the Central American summit, which is focused on 
economic recovery, said the presidents might call for troop reduction talks as 
early as next month. But they said progress is unlikely because of continuing 
warfare between leftist guerrillas and the governments of El Salvador and 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
However, they said that the Sandinistas' departure through free elections and 
the subsequent demilitarization of Nicaragua have eased regional tensions and 
improved prospects for negotiated settlements of the two remaining conflicts. 
Slow-moving peace talks are under way in both. 
</P>
<P>
"Dona Violeta is going to the summit with an initiative that could have 
enormous impact," said Alfredo Cesar, a former anti-Sandinista rebel leader who 
advises the Nicaraguan president on military affairs. "What she wants is to 
have a decisive influence on the demilitarization of Central America." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas took power as a guerrilla army in 1979 and built up their 
forces with Soviet assistance during the war against the U.S.-backed Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Nicaragua's armed forces had 96,660 officers, regular troops and 
reserves, according to Ortega. By the time Chamorro took office, they had 
shrunk to just over 80,000 members because of desertions. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's military has 57,000 members, Guatemala's has 43,000 and Honduras' 
has 20,000. Having expanded with U.S. assistance during the 1980s, the armed 
forces wield considerable power in all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a war to fight, Honduran military commanders brought pressure on 
that country's legislature this month to kill legislation to abolish army 
conscription. Honduran officials say they oppose any cuts in their armed forces 
because they are relatively small. Arriving for the summit Friday, Honduran 
President Rafael Callejas said he opposes manpower cuts in his military because 
it is relatively small but is willing to discuss mutual reductions of heavy 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani told reporters here that any serious 
discussion about reducing his nation's armed forces would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
"But obviously once this conflict has stopped -- and with the peace process 
that is under way, this will come soon -- we will be able to cut back our army 
to its normal peacetime force," Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani's aides have said this means an army of 14,000 to 16,000 and 
separation of various police forces from army control. 
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting here is an outgrowth of the August, 1987, peace agreement 
drafted by then-President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, the lone Central American 
country without an army. The five-nation accord called for cease-fires, 
amnesties and democratic reforms to defuse guerrilla wars. 
</P>
<P>
The most tangible result of the regional peace process came last weekend when 
Chamorro personally disarmed a dozen rebel field commanders in a rain-drenched 
ceremony and declared the war over. 
</P>
<P>
Since an April 19 armistice among Gen. Ortega, Chamorro's advisers and Contra 
leaders, 14,200 men and women, virtually the entire rebel army, have 
surrendered their weapons to U.N. peace-keeping forces. About 1,650 rebels in 
five cease-fire zones still have their weapons, U.N. officials said, but are 
expected to be disarmed within days. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro said Friday she was especially satisfied that "no Nicaraguan has lost 
his life because of war" since she took office. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the army reduction, she promised that all conscripts serving 
two-year tours under a now-abolished military draft will be allowed to go home 
by Dec. 7. And she ordered the army and the police to disarm all civilians by 
Christmas, using joint teams of Sandinista officers and former Contra 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro gave few details of how the army will be restructured but said that 
special security measures will be offered to protect high-level officers sent 
into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later, Ortega said he and his Sandinista-dominated 
officer corps will decide who stays in the army. He said major cuts in the 
military had been planned by the Sandinistas but couldn't be carried out until 
the war ended. He brushed aside questions about his own tenure. 
</P>
<P>
The general is the brother of former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega. 
Chamorro's decision to keep him temporarily as head of the army caused an 
uproar among her coalition on inauguration day, but the gamble appears to be 
paying off. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their bitter enmity with Ortega, the Contras disarmed, and the general 
agreed to carry out Chamorro's troop reduction. He said the cuts will relieve 
Nicaragua of "a heavy burden of military spending" while preserving the 
"efficiency and professionalism" of the army. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan army was formed by the Marxist-led Sandinista government that 
came to power with the 1979 overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza. During the 
height of the war against the U.S.-backed Contras, the army -- still officially 
called the Popular Sandinista Army -- grew to over 100,000 men armed with an 
array of Soviet-supplied weapons. Local media had reported that President 
Chamorro was considering announcing the resignation of army commander Gen. 
Humberto Ortega, older brother of former President Daniel Ortega. But Chamorro 
made no reference to Gen. Ortega in her speech, and the latter told reporters 
afterwards that he was staying on in his post.

E. GERMANY ACCEPTS PLAN TO RETURN SEIZED PROPERTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany tentatively agreed Friday to return property seized by the 
Communist regime over the past 40 years, opening the floodgates for hundreds of 
thousands of West Germans who want to reclaim the homes and businesses they 
thought they had lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement signed by the East and West German governments is the first 
major step toward resolving the most emotionally charged issue of German 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is "one of the most difficult with regard to the German-German 
division, which personally concerns and affects many people," said Rudolf 
Seiters, chief of staff for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
The four-page document, released in Bonn, did not specify how much property or 
how many owners could be affected, nor did it estimate the cost of carrying out 
the historic treaty. 
</P>
<P>
But government officials in both countries previously have estimated that as 
many as 1 million pieces of property in East Germany were expropriated by the 
Communist regime toppled in a bloodless revolution last November. 
</P>
<P>
Just who owns what and where has become a painful controversy in recent months 
as hundreds of West Germans have showed up unannounced on East German doorsteps 
with old deeds, demanding their abandoned family homes. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans have come to dread what they call simply "the visits." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's agreement protects the rights of East German tenants living in 
disputed apartments or on disputed property, offering former owners unspecified 
compensation instead of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The two governments agreed that former owners were entitled to compensation but 
could not retrieve their property if apartment, commercial or public buildings 
now stand on the land. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans have, among other things, asserted that deluxe hotels and part of 
East Berlin's famed Alexanderplatz now stand on property that once was theirs. 
Claims also have been staked against villas and estates used by corrupt former 
officials of the Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty also applies to East Germans whose property was confiscated by the 
Communists, and to heirs in cases where original owners have died. 
</P>
<P>
However, it does not cover property seized during 1945-1949 by the Soviets 
during their postwar administration of territory that became East Germany when 
the country was founded in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet and East German governments see no possibility of reversing the 
measures taken at the time," the statement said, adding that the West German 
government "takes note of this in light of historic developments." 
</P>
<P>
In part, the document said that "expropriated landed property will be returned 
to its former owners or their heirs. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The East German government is expected to release details on applying for 
compensation or reclaiming property, giving claimants a six-month period to 
file. 
</P>
<P>
Companies nationalized by the Communist government will be returned to their 
previous private owners, or compensation will be paid, the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
Many factories and firms have taken steps to privatize themselves since East 
Germany elected its first democratic government March 18. It was not 
immediately clear whether these companies would also automatically revert to 
original ownership. 
</P>
<P>
A "socially acceptable compensation" is to be ironed out for East Germans who 
unwittingly bought appropriated land or own buildings erected on confiscated 
property, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the accord states that any property obtained through "unfair 
machinations (i.e., misuse of power, corruption, intimidation or cheating)" is 
not protected and that the title "is to be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
The clause will probably be applied to property owned or claimed by members of 
the former Communist hierarchy, and could conceivably be used against ordinary 
party members who pulled political strings to get better homes. 
</P>
<P>
What remains unresolved is the responsibility of former owners. 
</P>
<P>
Some West Germans, particularly, worry that in a united Germany they might be 
held responsible for costly renovations and repairs to old homes or businesses 
they abandoned decades ago when they fled west after the war. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of materials and skilled labor have left hundreds of thousands of 
buildings in East Germany virtually crumbling. An estimated one-third of all 
dwellings are without indoor plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's agreement came after weeks of tough negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said experts from both governments will clarify details in the 
near future.

BILL TO EASE HATCH ACT'S POLITICAL CURBS VETOED; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: AIDES SAY BUSH WILL ALSO REJECT A MEASURE TO GRANT WORKERS UNPAID 
FAMILY LEAVES. OVERRIDES ARE UNLIKELY.

<P>
President Bush vetoed a measure Friday that would allow federal workers to take 
a more active role in partisan politics, and aides repeated his pledge to veto 
a bill that would guarantee workers the right to take unpaid family or medical 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Congress, which has not yet overturned a Bush veto, appears unlikely to be able 
to override in either case. But Democrats hope both vetoes -- Bush's 12th and 
13th so far -- will provide them with workable campaign issues during this 
fall's elections. 
</P>
<P>
The federal workers bill would amend the Hatch Act, the law that bars 
government employees from taking part in almost any partisan activity beyond 
merely voting. Changing the Hatch Act has been a popular cause among many of 
the federal government's 3 million civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
The family and medical leave bill, which cleared Congress Thursday night, has 
been a major goal of women's groups and labor unions for several years. Polls 
show that the idea is extremely popular among women who work outside the home 
and younger voters of both sexes, constituencies eagerly sought by both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Unions representing federal workers have long argued that the Hatch Act is 
unfair, barring federal workers from the kind of political activities that 
other citizens are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush, in his veto message, praised the law. "The Hatch Act has successfully 
insulated the federal service from the undue political influence that would 
destroy its essential political neutrality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After all the debate, no real need to repeal the existing Hatch Act has been 
demonstrated," he wrote, adding that the proposed changes would "inevitably 
lead to re-politicizing" the civil service. 
</P>
<P>
The bill Bush vetoed would have allowed federal civil service and postal 
service employees to hold office in political parties, serve as delegates to 
political conventions and to solicit political contributions from co-workers 
under protections designed to prevent supervisors from forcing their underlings 
to make contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Although several Republicans representing states and districts with large 
numbers of government workers supported the bill in Congress, debate over the 
Hatch Act has a strongly partisan cast. Republican Party officials have argued 
that easing the Hatch Act would strengthen the Democratic Party because federal 
workers more often than not support Democratic candidates. Unions representing 
state and municipal workers and teachers have become some of the strongest 
sources of Democratic Party workers, they point out. 
</P>
<P>
The Hatch Act bill had passed both houses of Congress by more than the 
two-thirds margin needed to overturn a presidential veto: 334 to 87 in the 
House on Tuesday and 67 to 30 in the Senate last month. But congressional 
leaders and Administration vote counters both agree that enough Republican 
senators are likely to switch their votes to uphold Bush's veto. 
</P>
<P>
The family and medical leave bill would require companies with more than 50 
workers -- a group that employs nearly half of the nation's workers -- to 
guarantee employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or 
serious illness of the worker, a child, a spouse or parent. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he opposes the idea of the government's mandating such benefits. 
Business leaders argue that the bill would cost them too much, and, in a 
meeting with business lobbyists last month, White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu pledged that Bush would veto it. 
</P>
<P>
When asked Friday morning if that veto threat still stands, Bush spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater said, simply: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders have accused Bush of waffling on the issue, noting that 
during his campaign last fall he pledged to support measures to "ensure that 
women don't have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a child or 
caring for a child after a serious illness." 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to see if President Bush advocates the same policies as President as 
he did on the campaign trail," said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by the Senate on a voice vote Thursday night after being 
passed by the House last month, 237 to 187.

CATHOLIC POLITICIANS ASSAIL CARDINAL'S ABORTION THREAT

Prominent Catholic politicians who support abortion rights have vowed to stand 
firm on the issue despite an "intimidating" statement from Cardinal John J. 
O'Connor that they could face excommunication. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this type of language is intemperate, mean-spirited and in contempt of 
Christian and Catholic belief," said Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), whose 
invitation to speak at a Catholic high school commencement was recently 
rescinded by the archdiocese because of his support for legal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo termed O'Connor's warning "upsetting . . . disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
"The church leadership, led by the cardinal, the College of Cardinals and the 
Pope -- we defer to them, respect them and let them speak for certain 
authority," said Cuomo, who opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm a layman, and I speak for myself. It's about people having the choice 
in our democracy and the freedom to have the choice. I have not changed my 
mind, nor will I." 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo's comments were made in response to O'Connor's warning, which appeared 
Thursday in the weekly newspaper of the Archdiocese of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Where Catholics are perceived not only as treating church teaching on abortion 
with contempt, but helping to multiply abortions by advocating legislation 
supporting abortion, or by making public funds available for abortion, bishops 
may decide that . . . such Catholics must be warned that they are at risk of 
excommunication," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Excommunication, the most powerful punishment that the church can impose, cuts 
Catholics off from the sacraments, with the exception of penance.

LITHUANIA WILL GET SOME NATURAL GAS TODAY, KREMLIN AIDE SAYS

<P>
A member of the Communist Party Politburo confirmed Friday that the blockade of 
natural gas to Lithuania will be partially lifted starting today as a gesture 
of Kremlin goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow ordered the cutoff of all oil, most natural gas and some raw material 
shipments to Lithuania in April in an effort to persuade the republic to 
rescind its independence declaration of March 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin gave the first sign that it may be ready to ease the blockade 
Wednesday, when Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov reportedly told 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene that 15% of the republic's 
natural gas supply would be restored. However, there had been no sign of the 
gas actually arriving. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, Politburo member Yuri Maslyukov said natural gas 
supplies to a large fertilizer plant in Lithuania would be turned back on, as 
promised in the talks between Prunskiene and Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
"At that meeting, as far as I know, there was a request from Prunskiene to 
supply gas," Maslyukov said. "Ryzhkov gave that instruction, that is 3.5 
million cubic meters of gas starting from tomorrow to be supplied to that 
plant." 
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov, who is also head of the state planning committee, said it was a 
goodwill gesture from the Soviet Union and a "reiteration of the Soviet 
government's interest in speeding negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Jonova fertilizer plant, Mysyunas Tautvid, said the company 
received a telegram confirming that natural gas supplies would be restored 
today. 
</P>
<P>
At a separate news conference, Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov said that 
the whole blockade of oil and natural gas will be lifted once Lithuania's 
Parliament freezes the implementation of its independence act. 
</P>
<P>
Lukyanov said that suspending the implementation of the declaration of 
independence would meet the constitutional requirements set by the Congress of 
People's Deputies in March when it declared Lithuania's actions invalid and 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for negotiations and political dialogue, but first the mandate of 
the Congress of People's Deputies must be fulfilled," Lukyanov said.

U.S. TO BLOCK ECONOMIC AID TO ROMANIA; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCUSES THE ILIESCU GOVERNMENT OF POLITICAL 
REPRESSION. THE ACTION COMES IN THE WAKE OF VIGILANTE VIOLENCE.

<P>
The Bush Administration, accusing President Ion Iliescu of heading Romania back 
down the road to repression and dictatorship, said Friday that it will drop the 
Bucharest regime from the list of emerging Eastern European democracies being 
considered for U.S. economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Iliescu's use of 
truncheon-wielding miners to attack anti-government demonstrators "strikes at 
the very heart of Romanian democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"Until the democratic process is restored, the United States has decided to 
withhold all . . . economic support assistance that Romania might be eligible 
for," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action will have little immediate impact on Iliescu's government 
because it has never received U.S. economic assistance anyway. But Boucher said 
a future aid program had been under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iliescu and his National Salvation Front won Romania's first 
multi-party election since before World War II. The State Department said the 
balloting was "flawed" by violence and intimidation, but the defects probably 
did not change the outcome because the front appeared to have adequate support 
to win in any case. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said any possibility of future U.S. economic assistance to Romania has 
been jeopardized by the street violence of recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"Organized attacks against the offices of opposition political parties and 
independent newspapers and beating of political figures who pursue democratic 
goals through peaceful means, by workers summoned to Bucharest by President 
Iliescu himself, both threaten to return Romania to authoritarianism," Boucher 
said, reading from a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We call on President Iliescu and his government to halt immediately any 
further action against Romania's fledgling democratic process," he said. 
"Specifically, he should clear all worker vigilantes from the streets and 
publicly pledge that they will not be encouraged to return." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has been ambivalent about Romania since the overthrow and 
execution of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Washington clearly prefers 
the Iliescu government to the former regime, even though it has fallen far 
short of the democratic reforms that have accompanied the peaceful 
anti-Communist revolutions in neighboring Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the U.S. government froze consideration of most-favored-nation 
trading concessions for Romania as a result of the election irregularities. He 
said Friday's action means "that the further consideration of aid that might 
have been forthcoming . . . has also been put on hold." 
</P>
<P>
The action does not affect humanitarian assistance, such as $80 million in food 
and $1 million in medical supplies that were announced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher called on Iliescu to "provide public guarantees of safety for leaders 
and members of all political parties . . . and reopen all independent 
newspapers and magazines." He also urged the government to "engage opposition 
parties and other groups in a dialogue to repair the damage to Romanian 
democracy which has been caused by the events of the past few days."

WARSAW PACT FAILS TO FIND AGREEMENT ON REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
ALLIANCE: ENDING TWO DAYS OF TALKS, MEMBERS CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE 'REAL 
POSSIBILITIES' THAT BOTH NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT WILL BECOME 
'NON-CONFRONTATIONAL.'

<TEXT>
<P>
With faith among Eastern Europe's newborn democracies clearly faltering, Warsaw 
Pact defense ministers wrapped up a crucial meeting on the alliance's future 
Friday with no specific outline for expected reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, meanwhile, asserted that the Warsaw 
Pact cannot dissolve or loosen the ties binding its seven member-states in the 
face of NATO's "military might." 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact declared last week following a meeting in Moscow that it would 
convert from its Kremlin-dominated structure to a political alliance of 
sovereign, equal states. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in the town of Strausberg, 20 miles east of Berlin, the ministers ended 
two days of talks about the alliance's future, which has been cast into doubt 
by signs that Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland wish to leave. 
</P>
<P>
A working paper on transforming the pact is expected to be ready by October, 
and the ministers indicated that they would probably meet in a special session 
at a later date. They said discussions this time touched on basic changes, the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe, and reductions in arms and 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers "exchanged views on developments in the European strategic 
situation and made an assessment of 35 years of Warsaw Pact activities," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
That included openly discussing controversial military actions by the Pact, 
such as the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary and the 1968 invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek said, "The countries which were 
involved in the 1968 invasion have apologized." 
</P>
<P>
The question of East Germany's military status, if discussed, was not commented 
on publicly by the ministers in their statement. 
</P>
<P>
The four victorious allies of World War II -- the United States, the Soviet 
Union, France and Britain -- continue to negotiate the issue as German 
unification looms, with the West insisting that a united Germany be a 
full-fledged member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Moscow 
steadfastly resisting the demand. The West German and Soviet foreign ministers 
plan to resume talks on German unification Monday in Muenster, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The East German defense and disarmament minister, Rainer Eppelmann, called both 
alliances "relics of the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
Eppelmann also urged slower German unification, saying September, 1992, would 
be a "realistic date" that would allow time to create a bloc-free European 
security system. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, he said, must not be "left standing at the door" of a united 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"If the security aspects of a united Germany and a united Europe could take 
effect on the same day, we could save all this talk about interim solutions -- 
who should belong to what alliance," Eppelmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The two Germanys already have agreed to merge their social, economic and 
monetary systems July 2, and all-German elections could take place as early as 
December. 
</P>
<P>
In their closing statement, the defense ministers said there are "real 
possibilities" that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact will become 
"non-confrontational . . . and will be able to make a positive contribution to 
the development of pan-European security structures." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they pledged that Pact members will "continue to be led in 
their military policies by the defensive doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
That stance was echoed by Yazov, who told Tass that NATO remains a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no right to shut our eyes to the fact that NATO still exists and 
maintains all the attributes of its military might," the Soviet defense 
minister said. 
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the provision of NATO armies with the newest armaments is being 
speeded up and its combat might is being built up," Yazov said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under these conditions, we cannot slacken our ties of alliance," he said.

MALAYSIANS HAVE TURNED AWAY 8,500 'BOAT PEOPLE,' OBSERVERS SAY

<P>
More than 8,500 Vietnamese "boat people" have been turned away from Malaysian 
shores despite a pledge by the country to offer the refugees asylum, 
international observers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said they fear the practice of turning away the Vietnamese, 
called boat people because they flee Vietnam in boats, could spread the growing 
refugee problem to other parts of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"What we experience in this part of the world now with the Vietnamese boat 
people, I believe could have a contagious effect," U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees Thorvald Stoltenberg said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, who is making his first visit to the region since assuming office 
in January, said he fears an accord adopted last June at the Conference on 
Indochina Refugees is in danger of collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Southeast Asian countries agreed to offer asylum to all 
refugees while efforts continue to stem the flow of people from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Malaysia and other countries, however, indicate they have been 
turning away the refugees, leaving them adrift to try their luck elsewhere, 
because the countries are overburdened by the thousands of Vietnamese refugees 
already housed in crowded camps. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Communist invasion of 1975, thousands of Vietnamese have fled their 
homeland in an exodus that has not abated over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has forcibly repatriated some Vietnamese and offered money to others 
to return home voluntarily.

Question: How many electrical workers does it take to change a light bulb? 
Answer: In Australia, five. 
</P>
<P>
A New South Wales government report released this week tells a woeful tale of 
public-service inefficiency before recent government restructuring of state 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
It said the state's electricity commission needs five workers to change a light 
bulb in one of its power stations because of union rules. 
</P>
<P>
"An electrical fitter and his mate were on top of the crane," commission 
General Manager Barry Flanagan explained in the report. "The fitter called to 
the man driving the crane to move it to the next light. That man driving the 
crane couldn't accept the call from the tradesman. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to have a rigger and a mate standing by him so the tradesmen could talk 
to the rigger and the rigger could tell the crane driver."

Security forces took the offensive Friday and recaptured five of 20 Sri Lankan 
police stations overrun by Tamil guerrillas in a series of attacks this week, 
military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the drive by troops began as Justice Minister Shahul Hameed was 
holding peace talks with leaders of the rebels in their stronghold in Jaffna in 
the north. 
</P>
<P>
Hameed will return to Jaffna to resume talks today. 
</P>
<P>
At least 300 people, including rebels, security officers and civilians, have 
been reported killed in five days of attacks on army and police installations 
in the northeast by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
</P>
<P>
The military sources said columns of soldiers advanced on the towns of 
Trincomalee, Mutur, Pottuvil and Vavuniya and retook the police stations there. 
The troops also seized weapons and vehicles captured by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, security forces had recaptured a police station at 
Kankesanturai in the Jaffna peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said 22 Tigers were killed and five soldiers wounded in the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources in Colombo said the Tigers on Friday executed 23 police 
officers of the majority Sinhalese community they had captured from a police 
station in Trincomalee.

DEFEATED PRO-GOVERNMENT PARTY CALLS MYANMAR ELECTIONS A FRAUD

Myanmar's pro-government party, humiliated by an opposition landslide in last 
month's army-run elections, has protested that the National League for 
Democracy won by fraud, diplomats said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the complaint, lodged by the National Unity Party (NUP) with the 
Election Commission on Thursday, has added to growing doubts about whether the 
military government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, would accept the ballot results 
and step down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not clear whether this is sour grapes or some evil dark plan," said 
one diplomat contacted by telephone. "But it helps to confuse an already 
confused situation." 
</P>
<P>
The army, which has controlled the government since crushing street protests in 
1988, had pledged to hand power to the election winners. 
</P>
<P>
But since the May 27 vote, it has hinted at delays in the transfer and said 
nothing about the future of detained opposition leaders. 
</P>
<P>
NUP, the political successor to the Burma Socialist Program Party, which ruled 
the country during 28 years of isolation and rigid state control, has so far 
won only six seats, compared to 329 for the National League for Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said it was unclear whether the NUP complaint was sanctioned by the 
army. A text of the complaint, which detailed alleged election fraud in several 
constituencies, has not been carried in the official media.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS PRESS CASE FOR OWL

<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalists told senior advisers to President Bush on Friday that the 
timber industry has grossly exaggerated the economic impact of proposals to 
save the Northwest's northern spotted owl from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The White House officials who heard the environmentalists' story Friday had 
heard from the timber industry the day before. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to declare the northern spotted owl a 
threatened species next week, a move that probably will require that vast 
tracts of land be set aside for habitat protection, which will result in severe 
reductions in timber harvests. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Tuttle, director of the Wilderness Society of Oregon, said the 
environmentalists were "very encouraged" by the tone of the White House 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave us a chance to debunk some of the numbers that the timber industry has 
been using to support their case. Clearly, they are using worst case numbers 
and, in some cases, worse than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of government scientists said in April that 8.4 million acres of 
forests must be set aside to ensure that the owl will survive.

U.S. TO JOIN FUND TO HELP CURB OZONE DEPLETION; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BUSH SHIFTS STAND UNDER PRESSURE FROM EUROPEANS. THEY WANT WEALTHY 
NATIONS TO FINANCE THIRD WORLD MOVES TO SAVE ATMOSPHERE.

<P>
The Bush Administration, in a major shift on a sensitive environmental issue, 
announced Friday that it will support a proposed international fund to help 
Third World nations convert their industries away from chemicals that damage 
the atmosphere's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced in a statement by White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu, marks the first time the Administration has been willing to back a 
specific new mechanism to transfer resources from wealthy, developed nations to 
poor Third World countries to protect the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had been under heavy pressure from European allies to change the 
Administration's reluctance to endorse such a fund. British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher, for example, wrote to Bush earlier this month asking him to 
change his position. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to agree on the fund could have led to a public confrontation with 
European leaders at an international conference on ozone depletion that begins 
next week in London. It could also have endangered the success of an economic 
summit meeting of industrialized nations scheduled for early July in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that the ozone aid fund, to be administered by the World 
Bank, would cost $100 million over the first three years, with the U.S. 
contributing 25% of the total. The eventual cost after the first three years is 
"somewhat open-ended," an Administration official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, West German officials announced an ambitious goal of reducing 
by 25% their country's emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief source of a 
second atmospheric problem: global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The German decision, the most far-reaching yet from a major industrialized 
nation, is likely to further increase political pressure on the Administration, 
which has resisted calls for quick action on the global warming controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"The dominoes are starting to fall," said Rafe Pomerance, a World Resources 
Institute official who is a leading advocate of steps to combat global warming. 
He and other activists said he expected the move by West Germany -- one of the 
three largest industrial nations -- to increase pressure on the United States 
and Japan to make similar commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest decision by a government on the environment that has ever 
been made," Pomerance said. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts predict that transfers of resources from rich nations to poorer 
ones increasingly will be needed as the international community seeks ways of 
confronting global environmental threats. Leaders of Third World nations argue 
they often cannot afford less-polluting technologies and have insisted that, if 
the rich nations of the developed world are serious about pollution reduction, 
they should be willing to help. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush and his aides have been wary of such calls, foreseeing a potentially 
huge cost. Until now, the Administration had insisted that any aid for ozone 
reduction come out of existing sources of foreign assistance, rather than a new 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), a leading proponent of the ozone-protection 
fund, charged in an interview that the turnabout illustrated a lack of 
Administration initiative on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"They are always a last-minute holdout and an obstacle to progress," Gore said. 
"They grudgingly accept that bare minimum, and always at the last minute. They 
haven't provided any genuine leadership for the world community." 
</P>
<P>
The main culprits in the ozone problem are two classes of chemicals, 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are used as refrigerants and in some 
manufacturing processes, and halons, which are used to extinguish fires. 
Replacements for the ozone-depleting chemicals are gradually becoming 
available, but they are more expensive than the current compounds. 
</P>
<P>
An international treaty agreed to in 1988 calls on nations to reduce CFCs by 
50% and freeze production of halons. The goal of next week's London meeting is 
to amend the treaty to call for total elimination of the compounds by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials insisted Friday their decision to support a fund on 
ozone, which will primarily help India and China, is contingent on agreement 
from other countries that the decision will set "no precedent" for other, 
potentially more costly, aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the estimated $25 million or so the United States would 
contribute to the ozone fund during its first three years, an international 
effort to help Third World nations reduce carbon dioxide emissions would be far 
more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Reductions in carbon dioxide emissions can carry enormous economic costs, in 
large part because the chief sources of the gases are the most inexpensive 
sources of energy -- coal, oil and wood. 
</P>
<P>
The German decision on reducing carbon dioxide emissions was announced in 
Washington Friday by a West German Embassy official, Andreas Klaussen, who 
described the move as the implementation of a commitment taken by industrial 
nations at a summit meeting last year in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the German Environment Ministry, Berthold Goke, acknowledged 
that the 25% reduction target was "ambitious," noting that "you have to see 
that the economy will grow." The government has not yet announced how it 
intends to meet the target, but it plans to adopt such measures by the end of 
the year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have decided, however, that the 25% target will be enforced strictly 
in West Germany, rather than by taking advantage of expected pollution 
reductions in East Germany as highly polluting and inefficient factories there 
are closed after the two countries unify.

OIL-EATING MICROBES SPRAYED ON GULF OIL SLICK IN EXPERIMENT

Microbes began eating their way through an oil slick Friday as officials 
counted on an experimental method to help with the cleanup from the wrecked 
Norwegian tanker Mega Borg. 
</P>
<P>
"If it works in the sea like it works in (the) laboratory, we're going to solve 
the problem of oil spills in this country," said Texas Land Commissioner Garry 
Mauro, who has promoted the use of microbes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the concept is receiving mixed reviews in the scientific community. "I 
think snake oil would work as well as bacteria," said Richard Scalan, a 
research scientist at the University of Texas Marine Science Center. "A lot of 
politics are involved in this whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers have known for years that bacteria are capable of eating 
oil, many are skeptical that the technique can be used on large spills, which 
must be consumed quickly before they reach shore. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists fear that additional bacteria may serve only to break down oil 
into more toxic byproducts. They add that special strains of bacteria may not 
be necessary, because similar microbes are present in the oceans and are 
limited only by available nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
Officials aboard a 41-foot Coast Guard boat sprayed about 100 pounds of 
bacteria concentrated in a dry powder on a square acre in the Gulf of Mexico 
that was intermittently covered by oil. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria were applied only to a small section of the 30-mile spill, 
situated about 60 miles off Galveston. Officials said the slick could deposit 
tar balls on Galveston beaches by today. 
</P>
<P>
Bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria that have been bred as 
super-eaters to break down oil into harmless fatty acids that later are eaten 
by marine life, said Carl Oppenheimer, who developed the process. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fire aboard the tanker was finally extinguished Friday, nearly a 
week after it had begun with a shattering explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Observers said no flames or smoke could be seen coming from the Mega Borg, but 
the Coast Guard said that firefighters continued to stand by in case the 
still-hot ship reignited its cargo of Angolan crude oil.

Lawrence Singleton, driven out of California after serving a prison term for 
raping a teen-age girl and hacking off her forearms, will be tried on a petty 
theft charge July 30, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, 62, of Tampa, Fla., said nothing during the two-minute hearing and 
departed quickly to avoid reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Debra Behnke rescheduled the trial from June 25 at the request of 
Singleton's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, who pleaded not guilty to the charge last month, was arrested in 
Brandon, Fla., after a drugstore security guard allegedly spotted him tearing a 
$9.98 camera from its package. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton was released from a California prison in 1987 amid angry protests 
after serving eight years and four months of a 14-year sentence for raping a 
teen-ager and hacking off her arms below the elbow. His one-year parole ended 
in 1988.

MAN GUILTY OF HAVING WIFE KILLED

<P>
A millionaire computer entrepreneur who prosecutors claim persuaded his 
14-year-old daughter to kill his wife and then take sole responsibility for it 
was found guilty Friday of first-degree murder for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown served nearly four years at the California Youth Authority 
before telling authorities that her father, David A. Brown, 37, owner of 
Anaheim-based Data Recovery, had persuaded her to kill her stepmother, 
24-year-old Linda Marie Brown, because as a juvenile she would probably get off 
without going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the Brown case has taken other incredible turns. 
</P>
<P>
Brown married the victim's sister, Patty Bailey, who has since admitted 
involvement in the murder plot. And while Brown was in the Orange County Jail 
awaiting trial, law enforcement authorities secretly recorded a plot in which 
he tried to arrange to murder three other people: Patty Bailey, who was by then 
a star witness against him, and the chief investigator and the lead prosecutor 
on his case. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazingly bizarre," said David Miller of Garden Grove, one of the jurors. "I 
sat there, and I just couldn't believe all that I was hearing." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors deliberated just seven hours, an unusually short time in a murder 
trial. But during five weeks of testimony, they had listened for several days 
to secretly taped conversations of Brown. In one of them, while Brown was 
visiting Cinnamon in prison, he told his daughter that if she ever told the 
truth "then we'd all go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
"They key evidence against David Brown was not his daughter, or his (current) 
wife, but his own words," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson, who was 
one of Brown's targets. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors' finding that Brown ordered his wife's death to gain $835,000 in 
life insurance automatically elevates his possible sentence from one of 25 
years to life, the standard for first-degree murder, to life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin set formal sentencing for Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, in a dress shirt and tie but without a jacket, showed no reaction to the 
verdict. When the proceedings ended, he took a drink of water and walked 
swiftly as he was escorted to an adjoining waiting cell. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Gary M. Pohlson, said he and co-counsel Richard Schwartzberg had 
told Brown that he would probably be found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"We were faced with three days of tapes we had no defense to," Pohlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's daughter, Cinnamon, is still serving a sentence at the California Youth 
Authority for the March 19, 1985, shooting death of Linda Marie Brown, the 
defendant's wife at the time. Also in prison after pleading guilty to 
involvement in the murder is Patty Bailey, the victim's sister, who married 
David Brown after the shooting. She was 17 at the time of the shooting and is 
also at the Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Although prosecutors say neither woman got "a deal" to testify, Pohlson 
predicted that they will both be out of prison "within minutes after this is 
all over."

MISSING OFFICER FOUND IN VICTORVILLE; 
</P>
<P>
MYSTERY: MASSIVE HUNT CONDUCTED FOR BELL GARDENS POLICEMAN AFTER HE MISSES ROLL 
CALL. HE IS SPOTTED WALKING DOWN STREET 12 HOURS LATER.

<P>
A massive search for a missing Bell Gardens police officer ended Friday evening 
when he was found walking along a street in Victorville, the city where his 
abandoned police cruiser had been found earlier in the day, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Larimore, 35, was spotted about 6 p.m. -- about 12 hours after he 
disappeared with the patrol car -- walking along a residential street in the 
southern section of the city, Sgt. Michael Lenihan of the San Bernardino County 
Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
A citizen had heard his description on a newscast, remembered that he had seen 
the officer walking near 7th and Nisqually streets and called local police, 
Lenihan said. Larimore was found about four or five miles from where the 
abandoned squad car had been found. 
</P>
<P>
"He was coherent. He was not hurt," said Lenihan. "He gave no problems to the 
officers. He was very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Mounted police and other officers had searched most of the day Friday for the 
veteran officer who was seen early in the day walking toward the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
After he was found, Larimore was taken to a sheriff's station and was being 
questioned by investigators about his disappearance, Lenihan said. Authorities 
did not release any information from that interview and it was unclear exactly 
how the officer spent his day. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports after Larimore was found indicated that he was disoriented. The 
reports, which quoted Bell Gardens police officials, said Larimore told 
authorities he did not remember driving to Victorville and said he thought he 
had called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
Lenihan said "there's a lot of speculation" about what happened with Larimore. 
</P>
<P>
And though Lenihan described Larimore as coherent when found, he said the 
officer "did not remember what occurred this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Bell Gardens department picked Larimore up at about 9 
p.m. to return him to Bell Gardens, Lenihan said. 
</P>
<P>
Larimore, who lives in Long Beach, was expected to undergo psychiatric 
evaluation once he is returned home, Lenihan said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials released no other details about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The search for Larimore began after he missed a 7 a.m. roll call, an action 
that surprised his colleagues. When they were unable to reach the 11-year 
veteran on his radio by 8 a.m., they reported him missing to other local law 
enforcement agencies. Long Beach police were asked to check his residence. 
</P>
<P>
His white car, bearing a Bell Gardens police insignia, was found abandoned 
shortly before noon in a vacant lot in the desert town of Victorville, more 
than 100 miles away. The doors were locked. Inside were his keys, uniform 
shirt, police identification, driver's license and gun, Victorville police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
One caller, who had heard radio broadcasts about the missing officer, told 
Victorville police he had seen a man wearing uniform-style pants and a white 
T-shirt walking away from the car and toward the dry bed of the Mojave River. 
</P>
<P>
Larimore's disappearance stunned his fellow officers and his wife, said Bell 
Gardens Police Chief William Donohoe. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say anything to anybody when he came in this morning," Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Donohoe said none of his 50 colleagues or other friends who were interviewed 
Friday recalled any erratic behavior, problems or depression that might explain 
the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as much of a mystery to them as it is to us. . . . We are hopeful it is 
something that can be explained," Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
In Victorville, local police officers went door to door Friday afternoon 
questioning business owners and residents, Community Service Officer Denise 
Garland said.

IT'S LEWIS CRUISING IN 10.05; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: CONDITIONING SEEMS NO PROBLEM IN 100-METER VICTORY. BARNES IS 
UPSET IN SHOTPUT.

<P>
Sprinter Mark Witherspoon, who trains with Carl Lewis, sensed that Lewis was 
prepared for an extraordinary performance at the USA/Mobil National Track and 
Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week in workouts we had some pretty good starts," Witherspoon said. "We 
were running pretty fast. And I told Carl earlier in the week that he was ready 
to run well." 
</P>
<P>
Witherspoon's analysis of Lewis proved correct. 
</P>
<P>
Bursting from the blocks, Lewis ran 10.05 seconds to win the 100-meter dash 
final Friday night at Cerritos College. It capped an extraordinary two days for 
Lewis, the world record holder in the 100 meters at 9.92 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
After his start, Lewis accelerated from the field at the 60-meter mark to beat 
Witherspoon (10.25). Lewis thrust his fist into the air in triumph after 
crossing the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised that he ran so well here? 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to stay tightly focused on what I had to do, because I didn't 
expect too much out of myself," Lewis said. "I didn't know what to expect. I 
felt I ran three good races here. I was pleased with the way I ran. If I just 
stay relaxed and stay focused, I can start well, and that's basically what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Joe Douglas, Lewis' manager, hinted that Lewis might drop 
out of the meet after the qualifying heats because he wasn't in shape. But 
Lewis demonstrated that he's fit by cruising through three races in two days. 
</P>
<P>
In his first competition since September, Lewis ran a wind-aided 10.06 seconds 
in a preliminary heat Thursday, and then ran 10.20 in a semifinal heat to 
advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Lewis assured himself of a spot on the team that will represent the 
United States at the Goodwill Games next month in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Will he be there? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's putting so much on the Goodwill Games, and it's not a matter of 
trying to negotiate or money," Lewis said. "A week ago everyone was saying, 
'You can't go.' And now everyone is saying, 'Why aren't you going?' Settle down 
a little bit. We'll work things out and we'll be there. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't money, and it isn't that I'm holding out. It's just a matter of money 
. . . er . . . timing. The reason I'm here had very little to do with the 
Goodwill Games, but everybody continues to say 'He came here because he had to 
qualify for Goodwill.' But my being here is on a much larger scale. I'm trying 
to work together (with the Athletics Congress) to move our sport forward." 
</P>
<P>
In the meet's biggest upset, Randy Barnes, who set a world record of 75 feet 10 
1/4 inches in the shotput last month, was beaten by Jim Doehring. Throwing with 
a hand injury, Barnes put the shot 66-9 1/4, but Doehring got off a throw of 
69-6 3/4 on his last trip to the ring to win. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes had just one legal throw, followed by two consecutive fouls. He passed 
on his next two throws and, after Doehring passed him, Barnes intentionally 
fouled his last throw because he knew it wasn't good enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he injured his right hand between the back of the knuckles during 
the Bruce Jenner meet at San Jose last month and reinjured it at a meet in 
Milan, Italy, last Thursday. The injury makes it difficult for Barnes to grip 
the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't practiced at all," Barnes said. "I've been trying to rest my hand. 
I've got a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
Was Doehring surprised to upset Barnes? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not too surprised because I've been training very well in the last week," 
he said. "It's just a culmination of a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Kingdom, world record holder in the 110-meter high hurdles, had to come 
from behind to beat Michael Tony Dees in the hurdles. Kingdom was timed in 
13.22 seconds and Dees in 13.40. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off to a great start," Dees said. "But at the (number) eight hurdle 
Roger pulled up alongside me, and he shook me at the 10th hurdle. I have no 
excuses about getting second." 
</P>
<P>
A notoriously poor starter, Kingdom said that's the weakest part of his race. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last couple of years the thing that's been hurting me is the start of 
my race," Kingdom said. "And all during the offseason, and even at the 
beginning of this year, I've been concentrating on the start and trying to get 
out a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
But Kingdom made up for his poor start when he made his move midway through the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you're (behind) a number of times, it can make you start to press," 
Kingdom said. "But from having a poor start I've gotten used to it, and I just 
try to relax and make my move and come on strong." 
</P>
<P>
The high jump provided the most drama as Hollis Conway beat Doug Nordquist in a 
jump off. Conway and Nordquist both cleared 7-8 3/4, but Conway also cleared 
that height in a jumpoff and Nordquist failed to clear it in two tries. 
</P>
<P>
In other finals, Sheila Hudson won the women's triple jump with a wind-aided 
leap of 46-2. Hudson's jump would have surpassed her record jump of 46-0 3/4, 
but it won't be eligible for record consideration because of the wind. However, 
her best legal jump of 45-9 was a meet record, breaking her old mark of 45-5 
1/4, set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Harrison, Hudson's training partner, won the men's triple jump with a 
leap of 56-3 1/4 on his last jump. 
</P>
<P>
LaVonna Martin won the women's 100-meter hurdles in 12.90 seconds, Michele Finn 
won the women's 100-meter dash in 11.20, beating Carlette Guidry (11.25) and 
Evelyn Ashford (11.30), Steve Plasencia won the 10,000 in 28:11.41 and Debbi 
Lawrence set an American record of 46:14.4 in the 10,000-meter walk. Vince 
Labosky won the men's javelin with a throw of 261-3 and Connie Price won the 
women's discus with a throw of 191-6. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Joyner-Kersee needed just one jump to advance to the long jump final. 
Joyner-Kersee jumped 22-9 to qualify for today's final. She said she's planning 
to compete in the heptathlon at the Goodwill Games next month at Seattle. "I'm 
here to get in shape for the heptathlon," she said. "I've been bothered by a 
hamstring problem, but it held up today." . . . Mary Slaney qualified the 
today's 1,500 final by running 4:18.40 to finish eighth in a semifinal heat. . 
. . Butch Reynolds dropped out of a 200-meter qualifying heat because of a sore 
left hamstring.

BOXING: MOST EYES WILL BE ON MIKE TYSON, BUT SOME WILL WATCH GEORGE FOREMAN, 
FIGHTING A RANKED FOE FOR A CHANGE.

<P>
One former heavyweight champion will launch a comeback and another will 
continue his tonight in an odd-couple boxing doubleheader at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson, 23, in his first appearance since being knocked out by Buster 
Douglas in Tokyo four months ago, seeks to right his career against an old 
amateur foe, Henry Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman, 41 and 21-0 in his 39-month-old comeback, meets by far his 
toughest opponent tonight in Brazilian Adilson Rodrigues in the first of the 
co-features at 7. 
</P>
<P>
The former champions are heavy favorites. But Tyson will be under close 
inspection tonight by boxing followers, who will be looking for signs that his 
brutal beating in Tokyo might have in some way diminished the once-feared 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman has been spoon-fed a parade of stiffs, no-talents and washed-up 
opponents since 1987, when he announced that his 10-year retirement was over. 
But critics who have sneered at the quality of Foreman's opponents will finally 
be paying attention tonight, because Foreman, for the first time since his 
championship days, will fight a legitimate top-10 heavyweight. Rodrigues was 
ranked as high as second by the World Boxing Council before his knockout loss 
to Evander Holyfield last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's unranked opponent, Tillman, kept him off the 1984 U.S. Olympic team by 
beating him twice that summer. Tillman, one-time Los Angeles Fremont High 
football player, won a gold medal in Los Angeles, but has been a disappointment 
as a pro. He is 20-4, but 3-0 since hiring a new manager, Henry Grooms, in 
1989. Tyson is 37-1. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, heavyweight champion from January of 1973 to October of 1974, is 66-2 
and about 35 pounds heavier than in his championship days. He is slow, a 
clubbing style of puncher, but still immensely strong. He had suspect stamina 
even in his prime, when he was widely considered a three-round fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Dundee, trainer of Rodrigues (36-3), has no doubt instructed his man to 
force Foreman to use his aging legs in the early rounds and bring his comeback 
to a halt in the late rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman has easily been the media favorite this week. Some even suggest his 
future in this town is on its stages, not its boxing rings. Here's a sampler of 
Foreman's wit and wisdom: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "My strategy? I'm going to try to hit Rodrigues before he can duck." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Stop calling people old! Old is about 102. Nolan Ryan is not old. Neither 
am I." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Some of you guys wrote that I was fighting guys who were just off the 
respirator. That's a lie. All of 'em have been at least eight days off the 
respirator. Actually, I tried to fight the top guys and they wouldn't fight me. 
I offered to pay Carl Williams myself for a fight, and he wouldn't take it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "All sports stories in newspapers come out of New York and Philadelphia. 
New York and Philadelphia guys write 'em, and the rest of the papers around the 
country just pick 'em up. And boxing writers are really football writers who 
occasionally venture into boxing, and they don't know beans from sweet potatoes

NEWSWIRE: CELTICS SEEK TO KEEP SHAW FROM STAYING IN ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Celtics asked a federal court Friday to prevent Brian Shaw from 
playing for another team, after an arbitrator confirmed the validity of a 
multiyear contract Shaw signed with the Celtics last winter. 
</P>
<P>
In February, it was announced that Shaw had signed with the Celtics and would 
began playing with them in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter dated June 6, Shaw informed Boston officials that he plans to 
remain in Italy and play another year for the Italian team, Il Messaggero Roma. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw was the No. 1 draft choice of the Celtics in 1988 and played in Boston in 
the 1988-89 season before going to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic officials have filed a request in U.S. District Court for an order 
confirming the arbitrator's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw could not be reached for comment.

GANGS TARGETED IN FEDERAL SWEEP; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: MORE THAN 160 CRIPS AND BLOODS ARE ARRESTED IN 11 STATES. 
EXPANDED DRUG DEALING PROMPTED THE TWO-DAY OPERATION, AGENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 160 suspected affiliates of the Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods 
gangs were arrested in a novel two-day sweep by federal agents seeking to check 
a national migration of the city's street violence, authorities announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In what they dubbed "Operation Streetsweep," agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms arrested 166 people in 11 states and seized an unspecified 
amount of drugs, guns and cash. The raids began early Thursday and were not 
expected to end until late Friday night, ATF officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents said the sweep -- two years in preparation -- was prompted by the 
budding expansion of the gangs' drug-dealing operations out of Southern 
California and into other corners of the country. In recent years, members of 
Crips, Bloods and other L.A. street gangs have been identified in scores of 
cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Crips and Bloods were targeted because their level of violence has spread 
with the spread of drugs," ATF Special Agent Andrew Vita told a Los Angeles 
press conference. "We have investigations going in 32 other states and 69 other 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
Vita said 135 gang members were arrested in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San 
Bernardino and San Diego counties. Other arrests were scattered across Northern 
California and 10 other states, including Louisiana, Oregon, Arizona, Missouri, 
Oklahoma and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Another 100 were expected to be arrested later Friday and through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to get about 75% to 80% of those we were looking for," Vita said. 
"We hope to get the rest soon." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, five gang members have been arrested since the sweep 
began, and more arrests are expected, according to a press release from the 
local ATF office. 
</P>
<P>
The county probation office assisted the sweep by providing the names of five 
known gang members who are on probation in the area, said Tom Pautler, director 
of special operations. Probation officials told the bureau whether the 
condition of the gang members' probation allows searches of their residences 
without warrants, Pautler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not go out in the field on this," he said. "We strictly provided (the 
ATF) information on probationers." 
</P>
<P>
Neither San Diego city police nor the county Sheriff's Department was involved 
in the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
ATF agents said the gang members were arrested on a variety of federal gun and 
drug charges. Arraignments began early Friday in U.S district courts around the 
country for those apprehended, but by late afternoon none were believed to have 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said one motivation for Operation Streetsweep was that federal 
sentencing laws generally are harsher than local statutes. The ATF's major 
weapon is the federal Gun Control Act, which provides tough sentencing 
provisions -- a minimum of five years in prison -- for use of firearms in drug 
trafficking, regardless of the amount of narcotics involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The local agencies can't get them into federal court without help from federal 
agents," said Stephen E. Higgins, director of ATF, who appeared at the Los 
Angeles press conference. "In federal court, many of those without felonies 
will face a minimum of five years. Those with felonies are looking at 15 years 
-- no probation, no parole." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the operation -- not unlike many such law enforcement 
"crackdowns" -- had the trappings of symbolic gesture, a characterization that 
the agents permitted to flourish. On some of the raids in Los Angeles, for 
example, television news crews were allowed to accompany law enforcement agents 
to film the busts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to show that the gang problem is not just limited to Los 
Angeles," said Vita, speaking on the steps of the Naval Training Center. "It's 
a nationwide problem and we believe the federal government can have some 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
Added Higgins: "What began as a Los Angeles problem has now spread to a 
national one. This is a significant step to our commitment attacking drugs" and 
was "intended to send a message to violent street gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Some local drug investigators around the country were a bit baffled by the 
fanfare with which the arrests were announced. Oklahoma City Police Maj. Bob 
Tayor said his department's involvement in Operation Streetsweep began when 
federal agents "contacted us and said they wanted to do one (a raid) here." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said officers then led the federal agents on a raid of a local crack 
house, where five local people were arrested for involvement with drugs 
believed to have been supplied by an L.A. gang. Taylor described those arrested 
as gang "wannabes." 
</P>
<P>
In South Los Angeles, where many of the arrests occurred, some residents 
contended that the agents' attempt at sending a message to gang members was 
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"We must stop the source of drugs at the point of entry," said Chilton 
Alphonse, founder of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, which 
provides counseling to gang members. "Black children do not have the means -- 
the boats and the planes -- to be bringing drugs into this country. . . . 
Government and law enforcement should be attacking the supply, those 
individuals importing cocaine into the country." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from being misdirected, said residents, such efforts are just plain 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"The CRASH nights (sporadically scheduled sweeps by Los Angeles police 
officers) caught some people by surprise," said a former gang member who 
identified himself as Lil' Too Tall. "But people got used to them real fast. . 
. . Dope sellers would just kick it (rest) and come out on nights the police 
weren't around." 
</P>
<P>
ATF officials said operations such as Streetsweep have potential as a weapon 
against street gangs, and they said without elaboration that there would be 
more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Agents said other law enforcement agencies were involved in Operation 
Streetsweep, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department and the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Air Force supplied a C-5A jet to ferry 22 federal agents to 
Southern California Thursday to make -- and announce -- arrests. Air Force 
pilots unloaded participating agents at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in 
Orange County. It was the first time any military branch has joined domestic 
drug-fighting efforts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed the extra agents because we didn't have enough in our Los Angeles 
district office alone," said Vita. "We knew this would be big, so we called for 
added help." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Streetsweep marked the culmination of two years of planning by the 
law enforcement agencies, Higgins said. The original idea for the massive 
crackdown began evolving from the federal government's ongoing battle with the 
fierce Jamaican drug-dealing gangs, called "posses," that are terrorizing 
several East Coast cities. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the spread of the posses and gangs, Higgins said, the U.S. Justice 
Department recruited the ATF to stem the illegal gun-running that often goes 
hand-in-hand with the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw that the posses were spreading, and what they are doing was similar to 
what the gangs in Los Angeles are doing," said Higgins, whose agency has 
monitored the national migration of Crips and Bloods for more than a year. "The 
posses are spreading West and the Los Angeles gangs are going eastward." 
</P>
<P>
ATF officials said that some illegal Jamaican immigrants were arrested during 
Operation Streetsweep, but they were unsure if the nationals belong to any 
posses. Still, authorities acknowledged that posses are active in Los Angeles 
and a few even work in concert with the Crips and the Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, one agent from each of the ATF's 22 national offices flew into Los 
Angeles for briefings on the gangs with the LAPD and the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Streetsweep began at dawn Thursday and many of the arrests were made 
simultaneously across the country.

Under fire from Latinos, Mayor David N. Dinkins apologized Friday for offending 
anyone with his criticism of three Puerto Rican nationalists but insisted that 
he could not condone their violent 1954 assault on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the mayor said he would make no effort to prevent Nelson 
Mandela from meeting with the three when the South African anti-apartheid 
leader is in the city next week. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Mandela wants to meet with them or anyone else, that's his business," 
Dinkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor touched off a furor in the Puerto Rican community when he said 
Thursday that the three, whom he labeled as "assassins," should not share the 
stage with Mandela in Harlem because it would detract from the purpose of the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
What seemed to offend Latinos most was Dinkins' characterization of the 
nationalists, who are free after serving prison terms, as "assassins."

CREWS SPRAY OIL-EATING MICROBES IN EFFORT TO CLEAN UP GULF SPILL

<P>
Crews on Friday began spraying oil-eating microbes on the slick surrounding the 
burning supertanker Mega Borg in the first open-sea release of the bacteria to 
clean up a an oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard warned it was possible that tar balls from the 30-mile-long 
slick extending from the Norwegian vessel would wash ashore Friday in 
Galveston, although county officials said they had no reports of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not had any indication of any oil coming ashore," Pat Hallisey, 
executive director of the Galveston County Beach Park Board, said. "We're 
keeping our fingers crossed." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene Maestas said there were some "streams of oil," 
but the captain of the port ordered skimmers out to collect them. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard raised its estimate of the amount of oil released into the Gulf 
of Mexico to 4.3 million gallons, making it the nation's fifth largest spill. 
The Coast Guard would not elaborate on how it reached the 4.3-million-gallon 
estimate. The spill had been estimated previously at 3 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Crews on four fireboats continued spraying water on the 886-foot ship, which 
exploded and caught fire late last Friday, 57 miles off Galveston. Gray smoke 
spewed from the rear section. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said that most of the light African crude evaporated or burned, 
and less than 14,000 gallons remained in the water. 
</P>
<P>
The largest sheen of oil extended from the vessel for about 10 miles to the 
northwest, with two additional patches beginning 10 miles farther. The slick 
nearest to land was about 25 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
In the experimental use of the microbes, officials working on a Coast Guard 
boat mixed the sand-like bacteria with sea water and sprayed it on a section of 
the oil slick. 
</P>
<P>
The process, known as bioremediation, has never been tried on an oil spill in 
open seas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria eats the oil and reduces it to a fatty substance that would not be 
harmful to sea life. When the oil runs out, the microbes die.

MISSING OFFICER FOUND IN VICTORVILLE; 
</P>
<P>
MYSTERY: MASSIVE HUNT CONDUCTED FOR BELL GARDENS POLICEMAN AFTER HE MISSES ROLL 
CALL. HE IS SPOTTED WALKING DOWN STREET 12 HOURS LATER.

<P>
Mounted police and other officers searched Friday for a veteran Bell Gardens 
police officer who was last seen walking toward the Mojave Desert after driving 
himself to Victorville in a city patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Larimore, 35, came in early to work Friday morning, changed into 
his dark blue uniform, hopped into his patrol car and left, Bell Gardens Police 
Chief William Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
He missed a 7 a.m. roll call, which surprised his colleagues. When they were 
unable to reach the 11-year veteran on his radio by 8 a.m., they reported him 
missing to surrounding law enforcement agencies. Long Beach police were asked 
to check his Long Beach residence. 
</P>
<P>
His white car, bearing a Bell Gardens police insignia, was found abandoned 
shortly before noon in a vacant lot in the desert town of Victorville, more 
than 100 miles away. The doors were locked. Inside were his keys, uniform 
shirt, police identification, driver's license and gun, Victorville police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
One caller, who had heard radio broadcasts about the missing officer, told 
Victorville police he had seen a man wearing uniform-style pants and a white 
T-shirt walking away from the car and toward the dry bed of the Mojave River. 
</P>
<P>
Larimore's disappearance stunned his fellow officers and his wife, Donohoe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Donohoe said none of his 50 colleagues or other friends who were interviewed 
Friday recalled any erratic behavior, problems or depression that might explain 
the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as much of a mystery to them as it is to us. . . . We are hopeful it is 
something that can be explained," Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
In Victorville, local police officers went door to door Friday afternoon 
questioning business owners and residents. But no one matching Larimore's 
description had been seen, community service officer Denise Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, 30 members of mounted posses from nearby law enforcement 
agencies began scouring thea riverbed area. 
</P>
<P>
The search was expected to continue until nightfall and then resume this 
morning, Garland said. It would not have taken Larimore long to get out into 
rough terrain, she Garland said, because Victorville is surrounded by desert 
and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
During the daytime, the cool weather would have worked in Larimore's favor, 
said San Bernardino crime prevention officer Deborah Reagan, but at night 
temperatures were expected to drop below 50 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody out there on foot is going to get very cold," Garland said. 
</P>

However, Reagan said the San Bernardino sheriff's office has extensive 
experience recovering lost people -- often hunters and motorcyclists from Los 
Angeles, whom they call "flatlanders." 
</P>
<P>
"The desert can be real strange at times, especially to flatlanders," she said. 
"But we usually find them pretty fast."

SHERIFF'S BIKE PATROL PLANNED FOR FILLMORE 
</P>

<P>
In the latest move to fight nocturnal criminals on Fillmore's streets, the 
Sheriff's Department is gearing up for a bicycle patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies on the graveyard shift who tour city streets will use mountain bikes 
instead of cars, said Lt. Dick Purnell, who heads the Fillmore station. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore will be the only sheriff's station to use bicycles on the job, other 
sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have them mounted on horses but not on bicycles," Lt. Kathy Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
Purnell said Fillmore deputies on bicycles can patrol tight and unpaved streets 
more quickly and silently than if they were in a car. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows the guys to move quickly in the alleyways and get to their patrol 
car quickly if they get a call," Purnell said. "It's a good, effective way to 
watch for burglars." 
</P>
<P>
Without the distinctive engine sound and the crackling of a police radio, 
deputies are better able to steal up on unsuspecting prowlers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies have already used mountain bikes on their midnight patrols in 
Fillmore. Two months ago, deputies mounted on bicycles caught several prowlers, 
Purnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Purnell said he plans to use bikes from the lost and found department. A 
bicycle patrol should be in force within a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pastoral city of Fillmore, where surrounding fruit orchards and businesses 
in town have fallen victim to small-time thieves, could use a change, City 
Council members said. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of months ago, there was some prowler activity," Mayor John Murphy 
said. "I'd love to see it tried." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the idea of deputies on bikes, although new to some, is not likely 
to shock most city residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to be anything too novel. We've seen deputies on 
horses before," Murphy said. "If it's useful I think the citizens will support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Roger Campbell said bicycles may make easy work of a foot pursuit. 
"It would be a lot quicker and more maneuverable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Purnell said he got the idea from other cities in Northern California where 
police officers regularly use bicycles to patrol metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies will not be issued bicycles, but the bicycles will be available in the 
station if they are needed. Many of the deputies already peddle bicycles to 
work, Purnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ken Cozzens, who works out of the Fillmore station, said bicycles may be 
useful in catching unsuspecting youth gang members who congregate in the city's 
northern barrio. Cozzens said bicycles are easier to use than motorcycles and 
keep deputies in shape. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies may see their health improve from cycling on the job, Purnell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the intent, but certainly any aerobic exercise is good for you," he 
said.

MASS BY NEW BISHOP A BOOST FOR MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a clear rebuff of anti-immigrant sentiment, incoming San Diego Roman 
Catholic Bishop Robert H. Brom celebrated an open-air Mass in Encinitas Friday 
for migrant workers and spoke out on behalf of the impoverished laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Brom's brief but pointed homily called on all Catholics to rally around the 
plight of the migrants and other dispossessed people. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, we pray that members of the church will be a compassionate voice for 
those who have no voice, in behalf of justice and basic fairness, work and a 
decent wage, housing, health care, and other human services," said Brom, 
speaking in his embryonic Spanish to more than 300 worshipers, including many 
migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the church, we celebrate that we are all one family -- men and women, 
white people, black people and brown people, citizens and aliens, rich and 
poor," said Brom, who stood on an elevated podium at the end of a dusty 
Encinitas arena used for charro, a kind of Mexican rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
"And so tonight, we hope and pray that all people of good will join us in 
striving to eliminate prejudice, and to develop together a social conscience of 
solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
Brom wore a fuchsia-color skullcap and resplendent robes made of Mexican 
fabric, including a multi-colored stole woven with the image of the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, the patroness of Mexico and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
As Brom was celebrating the sunset service, he was accompanied by a mariachi 
band, whose smartly dressed members played ballads of pilgrims and sojourners. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop's sermon carried a striking message of unity and conciliation 
against what many perceive as a rising wave of resentment and racism against 
the area's immigrant population. Most of the migrants are men from Mexico and 
Guatemala, but many women and children immigrants also live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Brom, a native of rural Wisconsin, is scheduled to be officially installed as 
San Diego's Roman Catholic prelate next month, after Bishop Leo T. Maher 
retires. 
</P>
<P>
Brom has said he plans to reach out to the area's Latino population, and this 
was the second time that he had celebrated an open-air Mass for migrant 
workers. The first was in January, in a large migrant worker encampment in the 
Rancho Penasquitos area of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he spent time in Mexico honing his Spanish, which is still halting 
but was much appreciated by those in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"When we see him here, we know that he will help us," said Julio Felipe Leon, a 
34-year-old Mexican man who was among those attending the service. "We are all 
Catholics here, and it gives us pleasure to see him here." 
</P>
<P>
During his homily, Brom made no direct mention of the tensions in northern San 
Diego County surrounding the explosive migrant issue. But the controversy 
provided an unspoken backdrop to the whole evening. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstering the service's symbolic importance was the fact that it took place in 
Encinitas, where city officials have taken the area's most stringent measures 
against the migrant population. 
</P>
<P>
The service was timed to take place before June 22, the effective date of an 
Encinitas ordinance aimed at outlawing the roadside hiring of day laborers. It 
also took place near El Camino Real, the north-south thoroughfare, where each 
morning hundreds of Latin American laborers seek roadside employment. Many live 
in crude encampments on either side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
A banner placed at the entrance of the rodeo arena denounced the ordinance, 
saying the new law is intended "to harass men and boys whose only crime is to 
seek an honest day's work." 
</P>
<P>
After the 45-minute service, meals were served to the participants, and Bishop 
Brom blessed babies and posed for photographs with the mariachi musicians and 
accompanying rodeo artists. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event described it as successful in its purpose of 
consolidating support for the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact that he came to officiate a Mass for them is a strong statement 
that he cares," said Ozzie Venzor, an Encinitas resident who heads a group 
called Friends of the Immigrant Workers. 
</P>
<P>
A similar sentiment was voiced by Enrique M. Loaeza Tovar, the Mexican consul 
general in San Diego, who also attended the service. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite some of the negative currents against the presence of the migrants, it 
is good to see that there are many citizens who are open to the possibility of 
sharing with these people and enriching themselves in the mixture of culture 
that is so evident here," Loaeza said.

SILBERMAN'S LAUNDERING CASE GOES TO JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driven by greed, Richard T. Silberman led a "secret life of crime" and 
laundered $300,000 he believed was Colombian cocaine money, a federal 
prosecutor said Friday in urging a jury to convict the San Diego financier of 
seven felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, however, argued that Silberman is innocent and maintained 
that the FBI should be held accountable -- for not making it clear that the two 
deals in the case involved purported drug money and for using a "very scary" 
informer whom they allege threatened Silberman's family. 
</P>
<P>
After the conflicting closing arguments in the complex case, U.S. District 
Judge J. Lawrence Irving told the jury the case was theirs. The panel is 
expected to begin deliberations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Jerry Brown, said 
Friday that he felt "great." The courtroom was packed with his supporters and 
relatives -- including his wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding -- 
and he said, "There's a lot of strength in love and family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
The prominent San Diego businessman is charged with laundering money portrayed 
to him by an undercover FBI agent as the proceeds of Colombian drug deals. If 
convicted on all seven counts, he could be sentenced to up to 75 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was arrested in April, 1989, moments after leaving a San Diego hotel 
room where, according to prosecutors, he was negotiating a third 
money-laundering deal. 
</P>
<P>
His character emerged as a central theme in the closing arguments presented 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
said Silberman had "all the advantages society could bestow." The prosecutor 
said Silberman "had a lot" but "wanted more," and showed a constant pattern of 
"lying to obtain an advantage in financial deals." 
</P>
<P>
Lead defense attorney James J. Brosnahan, however, called Silberman a "decent 
man." The FBI decided to "get him," and Silberman has been "pushed to the 
jailhouse door," Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men were indicted with Silberman, but he is being tried alone. Two 
of the other four have pleaded guilty to felony charges connected to the case. 
The two remaining men, including reputed mobster Chris Petti, are scheduled to 
stand trial Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's arrest came after a lengthy FBI investigation that focused 
initially on Petti and mob interest in gaming operations at the Rincon Indian 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The probe turned to Silberman after he called Petti, whom he had known from a 
San Diego barbershop, in October, 1988, to discuss a potential business 
arrangement. It's what that arrangement developed into that is at the center of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The trial revolved around two transactions. The first was a November, 1988, 
swap of $100,000 -- supplied by the undercover FBI agent -- for stock in a 
Silberman gold-mining company. The second was an exchange of $200,000 for U.S. 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman maintains that the first deal was nothing more than a legitimate 
stock sale. Prosecutors contend that he was told -- and understood -- that the 
cash supposedly came from Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contends that Silberman was coerced into the second deal by threats 
aimed at his family by informer Robert Benjamin, an eight-time convicted felon. 
Gorder said Friday that assertion was a "red herring." 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the case, both Gorder and Brosnahan said Friday, was whether 
undercover FBI agent Peter Ahearn -- who posed as Pete Carmassi, a front man 
for Colombian drug lords -- conveyed to Silberman that the cash in the two 
deals came from drug deals. 
</P>
<P>
Though the case involves some 450 secretly recorded tapes of phone calls and 
meetings, Brosnahan said the tapes are bare of any explicit reference to the 
words "drug money" or "money laundering." That is a flaw requiring acquittal, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the defense lawyer, the FBI was required to say to Silberman, " 
'This is drug money, this is criminality. Throw it all over, Silberman your 
life is changed.' " Brosnahan added, "They had an obligation to do it, and they 
did not do it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorder, however, said that Ahearn made it clear the very first time he met 
Silberman, at a Nov. 9, 1988, meeting at a San Diego hotel coffee shop, that 
the money came from Colombian drug dealers. At various times over the next six 
months, Ahearn reminded Silberman for whom he supposedly worked, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, on Nov. 12, Ahearn said in a phone call to Silberman that "all 
they know is the coke." In December, Ahearn referred to the "drug types." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, Ahearn said the "money came from a bunch of . . . Colombian 
cocaine drug lords." 
</P>
<P>
Gorder asked Friday, "How much more explicit do you have to get?" 
</P>
<P>
As for Benjamin, Brosnahan said that it was an outrageous error for the FBI to 
use him in the case. He contended that Benjamin, who was paid $124,558 by the 
FBI during the investigation of Petti and Silberman -- largely for an 
apartment, car and spending money -- had a financial motive to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
It was through Benjamin that Ahearn was introduced to Petti and, subsequently, 
to Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder replied that the only testimony that there had been threats came from 
Silberman, who had every reason to make them up. Benjamin assuredly had a 
criminal record, Gorder said. But, he asked, "Who else do you expect to be 
hanging around with the likes of Chris Petti?" 
</P>
<P>
"All this stuff" about Benjamin "is a distraction," Gorder said. "The real 
question is whether (Silberman) is guilty -- not whether anyone in this 
courtroom would go to dinner with Robert Benjamin." 
</P>
<P>
The defense contends Silberman earned nothing in either of the two 
transactions. But Gorder returned repeatedly to the notion that, if anyone had 
a financial motivation to keep the deals going, it was Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder detailed Friday how, in the first deal, $90,000 of the $100,000 was 
wired in December, 1988, to a Hong Kong bank account -- that prosecutors 
contend Silberman controlled -- and then to a Swiss bank. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week of the time the cash reached Switzerland, two checks totaling 
$80,000 were wired from the same Swiss bank to an investment account Silberman 
maintained in New York, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you know why (Silberman) was so eager to do another . . . stock deal," 
Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond deal offered not an 80% rate of return, but one of only 4% to 6%, 
Gorder said.

CSU SUPPORT ERODING FOR TAYLOR RANCH; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CAMPUS: A TRUSTEE COMMITTEE MEETING IS LIKELY TO PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON 
OTHER COUNTY LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
California State University is backing away from its unyielding stance that the 
Taylor Ranch is its chosen site for a four-year university in Ventura County, a 
university official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce M. Kennedy, director of the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge, said 
the ad-hoc committee of Cal State trustees scheduled to meet Monday in Long 
Beach will now likely place a far greater emphasis on other sites in Ventura 
County besides Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"By law, the requirements say that the environmental impact report must include 
alternative sites," Kennedy said. "But this will go well beyond the 
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said sites that have not yet been formally proposed to the university, 
such as one near Rice Avenue and the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard, will also 
likely be considered. She stressed that she could not predict the outcome of 
the meeting of elected trustees on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that there had been a "clear indication of an erosion of support 
for the Taylor Ranch site." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy declined to be more specific, but said the threat of lawsuits may be a 
factor in the university's re-evaluation of sites. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is additional litigation from the owners of the Taylor Ranch or 
anyone else, I don't know how long the university can persevere" at Taylor 
Ranch, she said. "We need to husband our state resources and we can only 
proceed so long in one direction without support." 
</P>
<P>
Russ Baggerly, an Ojai environmentalist and outspoken opponent of the site, 
called the latest revelations "welcome news." 
</P>
<P>
"I think a decision like that has to be based on a number of factors, and I'm 
sure we the environmentalists are one of those factors, but not the only 
factor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all the community groups should now work together to support a Ventura 
County Cal State campus at a better location. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Councilman Todd Collart, who has remained neutral on placing a 
campus at Taylor Ranch, said he hoped the hinted change in position would move 
the county closer to establishing a university. 
</P>
<P>
James Salzer, who helped organize a group in support of the Taylor Ranch site, 
said Friday he was relieved that the university would now consider 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Taylor Ranch is a great site," he said. "But I was not so much in favor of 
Taylor Ranch as I was for a university in the county," Salzer said. He said the 
university position stated last December, that it was Taylor Ranch for a 
university or nothing at all, made him eager to gain support for the ranch 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat in on enough meetings with the CSU people to know they weren't kidding 
when they said Taylor Ranch or nothing," Salzer said. 
</P>
<P>
The state chose the 400-acre site on a hillside bluff just west of the city of 
Ventura after years of searching for a location that could accommodate a 
12,000- to 15,000-student campus to be built up over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the ranch refused to sell, presumably to gain a tax advantage 
from public condemnation of their land. But what state officials called a 
friendly condemnation later went sour and negotiations stalled. The owners have 
threatened to sue the university. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taylor Ranch site raised cries of opposition from Ojai residents 
who feared the effects of air pollution. Opposition also came from Ventura city 
residents fearing traffic problems in downtown Ventura and from residents of 
other cities in the county who preferred a more central location. 
</P>
<P>
The state decided in March to go forward with an environmental impact report, 
with a clear focus on the ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who issued the Taylor Ranch ultimatum, has since 
left the university system under pressure for reasons unrelated to Taylor 
Ranch. But University Vice Chancellor Jack Smart said Friday that the departure 
of Reynolds has little or nothing to do with the present university position. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee will recommend what they do regardless of the chancellor," Smart 
said. He also said he expected that Monday's decision would have a "substantive 
impact on the university project."

MAN SOUGHT IN RAPES ARRESTED

<P>
An Oxnard man who was convicted on rape charges in Pennsylvania was arrested at 
his apartment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Russell Morris, 31, was taken into custody at 5:50 a.m. by FBI agents 
and Oxnard police and charged with federal unlawful flight to avoid 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
Morris was found guilty last year on one charge each of rape and statutory rape 
in Allegheny County, Pa., said Gary Auer, FBI supervisory special agent. 
</P>
<P>
When Morris failed to appear for sentencing, a federal warrant for his arrest 
was issued, charging him with unlawful flight. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI learned Morris was in Oxnard after he was arrested Feb. 20 and charged 
with being under the influence of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
FBI investigators matched Morris' fingerprints taken during his arrest in 
Oxnard with those taken in Pennsylvania and traced him to his Oxnard apartment, 
Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris is being held at the Ventura County Jail. The federal unlawful flight 
charges will be dismissed and Morris will be returned to Pennsylvania, where he 
will face sentencing on the two rape charges, Auer said. KIM KASH

HURT WOMAN TELLS OF LEAP FROM TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old woman who was found on the side of the road with severe head 
injuries last week has told police that she was injured when she jumped out of 
a truck traveling about 45 m.p.h. in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Calloway of Oxnard was found on Santa Rosa Road near Morongo Drive in the 
early morning hours of June 8 with a skull fracture, said Lt. Joe Funchess of 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives, who could not talk to the woman as she floated in and out of 
consciousness, surmised that she had been pushed out of a car or beaten with a 
blunt object. Police originally thought that the case might have been linked to 
the beating of Michelle Green in Ventura on May 5. But Funchess said that 
possibility was ruled out almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Calloway told police that she met with four men in a parking lot next to the 
Lemon Tree Motel, where she lives, in the 500 block of Meta Street in Oxnard, 
Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
They got into a pickup truck and headed toward Camarillo. In Camarillo, 
Calloway decided that she did not want to continue on to Simi Valley and tried 
to tell the men to return to Oxnard, Funchess said. The men, who did not speak 
English, did not understand her, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Calloway panicked and jumped from the truck, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
Calloway told police that she did not know the names of the men and had no way 
to contact them, Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
She is in stable condition at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has been closed, Funchess said. CAROL WATSON

CHAMBER SUPPORTS POLICE, FIRE STUDY

<P>
The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce announced Friday that it supports a proposal to 
study eliminating the city's police and fire departments and hiring county 
agencies instead. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Johs, who made the proposal, has said she believes that 
Oxnard, which is facing a projected $2.8-million budget deficit, could save a 
lot of money by hiring the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and Fire 
Protection District. 
</P>
<P>
Several other cities, including Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo, Fillmore 
and Ojai, contract with the county for these services. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the city should seek bids and compare the cost and benefit of 
providing services using personnel and equipment, compared to buying these 
services from specialized companies by competitive bids," chamber President 
George Lauterbach said. "We need to know if we are getting the best bang for 
our buck." 
</P>
<P>
Chamber Vice President Stephen Maulhardt cited voters' defeat June 5 of a 5% 
utility tax increase as a clear indication that the council "needs to explore 
some real innovative and creative methods of cutting costs and solving the 
budget crunch." 
</P>
<P>
Johs is expected to explain her proposal to the council in detail Tuesday. KIM

2 FLEE IN STOLEN CAR AFTER JEWELRY THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men robbed a Thousand Oaks jewelry store at gunpoint Friday, escaping in a 
stolen car with $50,000 worth of jewelry, said a spokesman for the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bill Montigo said one man entered Emperor Jewelry at 140 W. Hillcrest Drive 
about 1:40 p.m. brandishing a pistol and yelling at a female employee to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Store owner Calvin Lau, 52, triggered the store's silent alarm and fled the 
store with the unidentified employee, Montigo said. Neither worker was injured, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A second man joined the gunman in the store, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
The men took the custom-made jewelry and escaped in a late-'80s Oldsmobile, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the car a block away and learned that its owner had reported it 
stolen in Los Angeles earlier in the day. Police searched the area around the 
store in patrol cars and helicopters but did not find the suspects, Montigo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tony Ditzhazy said the robbery was not related to a similar holdup in 
Thousand Oaks on April 28, when two men took $100,000 in jewelry at gunpoint 
from Best Products in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ditzhazy said police have not ruled out a connection to a May 26 
robbery during which five men armed with a handgun took $100,000 in jewelry 
from Zales Jewelers in Simi Valley.

DRUG-FREE PROGRAM IS CAMPUS HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Friday Night Live" has opened to rave reviews in Ventura County this year as a 
hip approach to persuade students to "drive sober and drug-free." 
</P>
<P>
The program, which began in November, has spread to four county high schools in 
Moorpark, Fillmore, Westlake Village and Port Hueneme. Several others are 
considering joining the statewide program that has enrolled more than half of 
the students in California high schools over the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
To join Friday Night Live, students sign an application stating their 
commitment to promote driving and partying sober and drug-free. In return, 
members receive identification cards that resemble a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
Students can use the cards for discounts at local businesses, including 
restaurants and music stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly about the benefits of Friday Night Live," said Kathy 
Staples of the Ventura County Alcohol and Drug Programs. The schools began the 
program last fall with the aid of a $30,000 state grant. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hoffman, hired with half of the money to be the program's part-time 
coordinator, said he is seeking donations from area businesses to continue 
Friday Night Live past its state funding deadline. The grant expires June 30 
and next year's grant from the state has been reduced to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
To promote participation in Friday Night Live as "being cool," students receive 
T-shirts, buttons, pens and wristbands in Day-Glo colors with the Friday Night 
Live logo. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see lots of Friday Night Live buttons on kids' backpacks around 
school," said Jonathan Kaplan, a Westlake High freshman and Friday Night Live 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Friday Night Live also encourages students to schedule social events 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids have a lot of energy," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
"They want fun activities, and if the events are free, it really makes it good 
for kids." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to dances, members have participated in picnics and scavenger hunts 
and plan to go on kayak and rock climbing outings. 
</P>
<P>
"Younger kids flock to this program and assume leadership roles," said Melanie 
Ashen, a Westlake High Spanish teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to peer pressure to drink or take drugs, some high school students 
must battle drugs or alcohol at home. Ashen said she has had students talk 
about their parents keeping "cocaine on the coffee table at home." 
</P>
<P>
To raise awareness of substance abuse, parents of Friday Night Live members are 
asked to sign an agreement stating that they will not permit their children to 
be served alcohol or to use illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"When a 15- or 16-year-old comes up after a weekend activity and says, 'Thanks 
for the best time of my life' or 'Thank you for changing my life,' no monetary 
reward can equal it," Hoffman said. RUSS CHARVONIA

$9.8-MILLION BUDGET ADDS 6 POSITIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark city officials have unveiled a $9.8-million budget that adds six staff 
positions and an increase for recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
The new positions include a public works director, solid-waste coordinator, 
code enforcement officer, two maintenance trainees and a part-time recreation 
coordinator, City Manager Steven Kueny said. 
</P>
<P>
The recreation coordinator will manage special events and recreational 
programs. About $63,000 has been requested by the city's Park and Recreation 
Commission for special events. 
</P>
<P>
Overall spending is up about 5.4% compared with last year, Kueny said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has reviewed the budget and will vote on it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city is collecting more in property and sales taxes than ever before, 
mostly because of development of residential and commercial property, Kueny 
said. Last year alone, Moorpark grew by about 4.2%, or 1,059 people. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the 7.9% increase in general fund revenues comes from the $321,277 in 
property taxes that were collected last year over the limits established by the 
Gann initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 budget also includes a projected $276,632 in excess property taxes 
that will be collected next year. Taxpayers may get a refund, since the 
spending of excess tax revenues must be approved by voters or be refunded, 
Kueny said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the city collected excess taxes was because the original limit was 
set too low, and the city grew faster than was projected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kueny said he will suggest the city develop five- to 10-year financial 
projections on tax revenues so that it can set realistic spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in revenues, at least one councilman said the city should 
take a conservative approach to spending in the event of an economic downturn.

'STAR TRIKE' DRIVER ENLIVENS CAST IN OPENING HOOPLA FOR DEL MAR FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loch David Crane was drawing a crowd. He came roaring through the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds Friday afternoon, shaggy hair blowing in the breeze. Behind the 
wheel of his "Star Trike," Crane was serving as grand marshal of a slow parade 
of characters and kooks. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Del Mar Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as the sombrero-waving statue of Don Diego proudly proclaims, "Bienvenidos, 
amigos!" It was at the feet of Don Diego where Friday's first-day-of-the-fair 
parade came to a screeching halt, and where Crane mopped his brow and pointed 
to his motorized "giddy-up mobile." "This is a scale replica of the Star Ship 
Enterprise, made from Volkswagen parts," said Crane, 41, who describes himself 
as a professional magician and two-time San Diego mayoral candidate. "I 
designed it while watching an episode of 'Star Trek' about 15 years ago. I ride 
it almost every day." 
</P>
<P>
Crane sees nothing unusual about that, nor about running for public office. 
He's convinced that one of these days he'll win and add his name to the 
pantheon of city stalwarts -- Wilson, Hedgecock, O'Connor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In my first race, I finished fifth out of a field of 17," said the Point Loma 
resident, who teaches English at National University. "That means I beat out 12 
other people!" 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the crowd around Crane was getting big. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, this is cool," cooed Robert Thomas, 23, of East San Diego, taking in the 
Star Trike with covetous eyes. "This I like." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas used the same tone of voice Donald Trump might use in eyeing a new hotel 
development, or which Shannon Weiner used most of the day in giggling to yet 
another blue ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, 5, had just won first prize in the Hula-Hoop contest when up came the 
gunny-sack race. She grabbed that too, but as for post-race interviews . . . 
well, Shannon was speechless. 
</P>
<P>
Next-door neighbor and best friend Andrew Ross did, however, have plenty to 
say. Andrew was less than thrilled at finishing second to Shannon's first -- in 
both events -- but, as if to atone, said pointedly, "You ought to know -- I'm 
five and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, Shannon and Capt. Star Trike were among the thousands who showed up on 
the first day of the fair, which has now run continuously since 1947. The fair 
has been around since 1880 and in its present location since 1936. (No fairs 
were held during World War II.) 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Diane Scholfield said first-day attendance figures won't be 
available until early today. But last year, Scholfield said, the fair set an 
all-time record with slightly more than 1 million visitors crossing the 
turnstiles in 19 days. This year's event lasts 20 days (through July 4), and, 
Scholfield said, another record is predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the fair is $6 for adults, $3 for seniors 62 and older, $1 for 
children ages 6 through 12 and free for kids younger than 6. The 12,000 parking 
spaces are free but often get filled by mid-afternoon. So shuttle buses will 
run on weekends and on July 4 from Torrey Pines High School, UC San Diego and 
the Eastgate Technological Park. 
</P>
<P>
No one complained about prices, but a few complained loudly about parking. It 
was not the lack of availability that riled them, but the mud. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we parked, the mud was ridiculous," said Marge Kearney, 68, of 
Oceanside. "I mean it, I'll never come here again. With all the money they 
make, you'd think they could pave the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
But Kearney's friend, Nancy Bress, 65, visiting from New Jersey, said mud or 
not, no Yankee fair can top Del Mar's. 
</P>
<P>
"The flowers here are out of this world," Bress said, "and the cleanliness! You 
just wouldn't find this back East. You'd find trash and crud everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the sights and sounds of the fair range from restless Belgian draft 
horses to Dixieland jazz to hanging fuchsia plants to ham radios to hot tubs to 
a new line of law-enforcement vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
And the food! One row included Philadelphia cheese steak sandwiches, Texas 
barbecue, Greek gyros, cinnamon rolls, fish tacos and hot fudge sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
The rides range from the Crazy Dance to the Falling Star to the Quasar. 
</P>
<P>
So why did Teresa Billick, a 7-year-old student at Solana Highlands Elementary 
School in Del Mar ride the roller coaster repeatedly? 
</P>
<P>
"Because," she said, "it's incredibly scary!" 
</P>
<P>
For those who enjoy a more soothing and sensual fair experience, one booth 
offered a free demonstration of a Pumi brush pad for hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Rutherford took the large, calloused, auto-mechanic hands of Thomas Stahl 
into her own and bathed them gently with soap, water and a Pumi brush pad. 
</P>
<P>
"Feels good," Stahl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a mechanic, your hands have gotten pretty rough," Rutherford said with 
soothing seriousness. "And I bet your girlfriend likes smooth hands." 
</P>
<P>
"That's true . . . " Stahl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, a package of this. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Hoffman, 83, of Encinitas was lying in an adjustable bed looking 
positively beatific. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great!" she said. "Why, fellas, you just wouldn't believe how 
comfortable this is." 
</P>
<P>
Duane Whiteley, 66, of Austin, Tex., was having his feet massaged and reacting 
about as cheerfully as Hoffman. Whiteley said he couldn't get over how "Big!" 
the Del Mar Fair is, and he's from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Hasn't he been to the Texas State Fair? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but this one's bigger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have these foot massagers on Congress Avenue in Austin," he said. 
"Brings back some memories. Why they ever got rid of those things, I'll never 
know." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Peter Strother, 15 1/2, from San Dieguito High School put it, there's 
only one reason -- or maybe two -- to come to any fair, whether for foot rubs, 
fuchsia or fish tacos. 
</P>
<P>
"The fair's just cool," he said. "And fun too."

Omar, the first Asian elephant born at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, made his 
first public appearance Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"For about a half an hour he was allowed into a small yard behind his 
quarters," park spokesman Tom Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
"He tested his feet on the dirt. He's been on concrete since he was born." 
</P>
<P>
Omar wobbled for a crowd of about 40. Hanscom said he is scheduled to make 
public appearances Saturday and Sunday, from noon to 3 p.m. Omar will also be 
visible from the monorail that runs through the park. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials said they separated the 265-pound calf from his mother when he 
was born early Tuesday morning because she rejected him and tried to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom said the park will raise the calf, which is now being bottle-fed on a 
human infant formula. Although the milk of his mother, Connie, is important to 
develop the calf's immune system, Hanscom said park officials are optimistic 
and are giving Omar better than a 50% chance of surviving.

REPORT ON KILLING BY DEPUTY SENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department on Friday forwarded to the district attorney's office 
and the San Diego County Grand Jury its 430-page investigative report into the 
May 18 shooting death of 21-year-old Jeffrey Bray in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which was not publicly released, contained no conclusions of its 
own, sheriff's spokesman Deputy Robbie Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney spokesman Linda Miller said the report will be reviewed by 
the D.A.'s special operations division, which will conduct its own, independent 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, Miller said, will decide whether criminal 
charges should be filed against sheriff's reserve deputy John Wickham, who shot 
and killed Bray when Bray stopped his vehicle in a Vista apartment complex, 
then backed up into the sheriff's patrol car that had followed him up the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Wickham and Deputy William C. Fewell had followed Bray into the apartment's 
parking lot because they suspected that Bray was driving a stolen vehicle. He 
was not. 
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness told The Times that he yelled out to Bray as Bray drove up the 
driveway, and that Bray simply stopped his car and backed up to talk to him 
without realizing that the sheriff's patrol car had pulled up behind him. Bray 
was killed by a single shot to his head at just about the moment the two 
vehicles collided. 
</P>
<P>
Bray's parents on Thursday filed a wrongful-death claim against the county, 
seeking unspecified damages. Bray's widow earlier had filed a similar claim. 
</P>
<P>
The claim by Joe and Brenda Bray of Conway, Ark., alleges that Wickham and 
Fewell "improperly shot and killed Jeffrey Bray without justification or cause. 
. . . without warning and in violation of proper police procedure." 
</P>
<P>
The claim also named the county as a responsible party because it "failed to 
exercise reasonable care in promulgating policy, regulations and directives 
which resulted" in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department review of Bray's death was completed four weeks to the 
day after the shooting, which sparked widespread criticism of the department 
and allegations that the deputies overreacted by shooting Bray after his 
vehicle backed into theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has asked the grand jury to review the 
shooting, a request that is expected to be taken up after the 1990-91 grand 
jury is seated July 1. The FBI is also conducting an investigation to see 
whether Bray's civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department material included not only a 430-page report, which 
represented its own internal investigation and interviews with witnesses, but 
also tapes and clippings of media coverage, photographs and tape-recorded 
interviews of witnesses, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the intention of our department to find a conclusion," Hill said. 
"We're providing the facts and evidence of the investigation, for the district 
attorney's review." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said D.A. investigators will look beyond the sheriff's report before 
making its own conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We will conduct our own, independent investigation," Miller said. "We'll use 
some of the material provided by the sheriff's office, but we'll do our own, 
complete investigation, interview witnesses ourselves, maybe request additional 
lab work, the whole gamut. This will probably take a while." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the district attorney will not review the Sheriff's Department 
shooting policy or guidelines on the use of deadly force, but rather simply 
review the shooting "for any criminal conduct on the part of the officer." 
</P>
<P>
"If we find none, we'll write a letter to the sheriff, explaining in some 
detail our findings and giving him a conclusion of our investigation. If we 
find criminal conduct on the part of the officer, we'll file charges to 
prosecute," Miller said.

ROBERT L. CRUM; BANKER, PARK COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Leslie Crum, a longtime employee of Glendale Federal Bank who served on 
the Glendale Parks and Recreation Commission for six years, has died in 
Arizona. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
Crum was also an active member of the Glendale Kiwanis Club and was on the 
advisory board of the Glendale Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
He died Monday of a heart attack in Phoenix while on vacation, said his widow, 
Beverly Crum. 
</P>
<P>
Born Aug. 16, 1922, in Akron, Ohio, Crum moved to California with his parents 
when he was 12. After graduating from Glendale College in 1942, he served as a 
private in the Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946 and witnessed the historic 
flag-raising on Iwo Jima in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
He later managed a local paint store and the Glendale Credit Bureau before 
becoming a teller for Glendale Federal Bank in 1972. He retired in 1987 as 
senior business development officer. 
</P>
<P>
Crum served on the Glendale Parks and Recreation Commission from 1967 to 1973. 
He joined the Glendale Kiwanis Club in 1958, serving as president in 1969 and 
lieutenant governor for the area's district in 1972. He originated an anti-drug 
button-selling campaign for the club. 
</P>
<P>
He also served on the board of directors of the La Crescenta-Glendale Campfire 
Girls in the mid-1960s and was the coach and manager of a California Junior 
Baseball League team in La Crescenta in the 1970s, said his longtime friend, 
Jim Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Crum was a member of the Glendale Salvation Army 
advisory board, a position he had held several times. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 43 years; daughters Nancy Becker of Fresno, 
Debbie Pierce of La Canada, Sandy Stephens of Irvine and Tammy Bryan of 
Westminster; and nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is planned for 1 p.m. today at Church of the Hills at Forest 
Lawn-Hollywood Hills, which is handling the arrangements. Burial will follow. 
Donations can be made in Crum's name to the Glendale Salvation Army, the 
American Heart Assn.-Northwestern Division or the City of Hope.

JARVIS HOLDEN ELLIOTT; REALTOR AND NEWSPAPER EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jarvis Holden Elliott, a newspaper editor in Connecticut during the Depression 
and a real estate broker during the post-World War II housing boom in the San 
Fernando Valley, has died in Sepulveda. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott opened a Studio City real estate office called the Valley Wide Company 
in 1949, which he operated until 1957. He was president of the San Fernando 
Valley Board of Realtors in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks resident died Wednesday of heart failure following a series of 
strokes, said his wife, Eleanor Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Born Sept. 8, 1903, in Brooklyn, N.Y., Elliott served as a Navy officer for 
seven years during the 1920s. From 1930 to about 1937, he was an editor of the 
Hartford Courant, his widow said. He later opened a factory in Granby, Conn., 
that produced parts for the Norden bombsight used by the Army Air Forces during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Elliott moved to California, where he spent 25 years in real estate. 
During his lifetime, he owned four small planes which he flew for pleasure over 
most of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
He will be buried at Los Angeles National Cemetery in Westwood. A private 
service will be held. Pierce Brothers Valhalla in North Hollywood is handling 
the arrangements.

SOCKERS WANT PRIORITY FOR SCHEDULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler said Friday he won't post the required $500,000 letter 
of credit with the MISL for next season unless he receives scheduling priority 
over the new International Hockey League team that is scheduled to play in the 
San Diego Sports Arena this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The MISL's deadline for letters of credit is Friday. Fowler said if he isn't 
satisfied with game dates, he will either fold the Sockers or move them to 
another city. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Cooper, who owns the Sports Arena lease, was awarded the minor league 
hockey franchise Thursday at the NHL meetings in Vancouver, Canada. Since the 
MISL and IHL seasons run nearly parallel to each other, Fowler has expressed 
concern that his team, an eight-time indoor champion, will suffer serious 
revenue losses and inconvenience if it is forced to share the Sports Arena with 
another professional team. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he will submit a proposal Monday detailing next season's schedule. 
The Sockers played 26 regular-season home games in 1989-90, plus 16 at home in 
the playoffs. The regular-season length for 1990-91 hasn't been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The hockey team is scheduled to play 41 regular-season home games, with the 
possibility of more in the IHL playoffs. San Diego State men's basketball team 
also plays in the Sports Arena (14 regular-season home games in 1989-90). Other 
activities include an annual holiday college basketball tournament in December, 
concerts and family shows. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said revenue for games played on weekdays last season was about 30% 
lower than Saturday games. He said he had informally figured that weekend 
conflicts could cost him in the neighborhood of $180,000 to $200,000, based on 
a predicted number of lost dates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to go forward on that basis," said Fowler, who says his team 
lost about $500,000 this season. "No sane man is going to go forward if his 
losses are 25 to 30% more. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry seems willing to work something out. The problem is: Can he? The reality 
is there are only a finite number of dates." 
</P>
<P>
Following a phone conversation with Fowler Friday evening, Cooper said he will 
make an effort to accommodate the Sockers but that the scheduling problems will 
be more complex than he originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't know that it would be this kind of hardship," he said. "I'm 
going to work with (Fowler). I'm sorry that it's creating a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will submit schedule requests to their leagues next week. Cooper 
estimates it will take each league approximately two weeks to approve the 
schedules, and then he and Fowler will compare them and attempt to solve any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Fowler said, the Sockers would like to play the majority of their home 
dates on either Thursdays and Saturdays or Fridays and Sundays. Since the IHL 
team is an expansion franchise, Cooper said he will get low priority on weekend 
dates, which he thinks may help his team work around the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get the worst schedule in the league," Cooper said. "Fowler has a 
high priority system in his league. He's going to get more opportunities (for 
weekend dates)." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said the problem of sharing the arena's dasher boards for advertising 
space has been worked out. Each team will have removable boards and be able to 
advertise at full capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The other issue concerning Fowler is office space, which will now have to be 
shared. Cooper said he is willing to pay an extra $2,000 of the Sockers' 
staffing fees if Fowler agrees to move some of his employees to an alternate 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Other MISL teams have adapted to sharing arena space with a minor league hockey 
team. The Kansas City Comets, one of seven other MISL teams, share Kemper Arena 
with the Kansas City Blades of the IHL. The Comets, Fowler said, have 
scheduling priority. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the Sockers and a hockey team won't affect the Aztec basketball 
schedule, said Jim Herrick, SDSU associate athletic director. Herrick said the 
Aztecs already have the majority of their games set for the 1990-91 season and 
will receive priority over both the Sockers and the IHL team. 
</P>
<P>
In other IHL developments Friday, the league approved the relocation of the 
Fort Wayne Komets to Albany, N.Y. A league spokesman said efforts are being 
made to put another team in Fort Wayne before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego franchise will play in the Western Division with Kansas City, 
Salt Lake City, Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Peoria. The East will consist of 
Muskegon, Indianapolis, Kalamazoo, Flint, Albany and possibly Fort Wayne.

JOYNER-KERSEE STARTS LONG JUMP AT THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, competing in her first open long jump competition since 
winning the 1988 Olympic gold medal, had the best performance by an American 
this year during qualifying at the USA/Mobil National Track and Field 
Championships Friday at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, the American record-holder, leaped 22 feet 9 inches on her first 
attempt in leading the qualifying for Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," Joyner-Kersee said. "I was not looking for that distance 
today." 
</P>
<P>
"Her speed and strength are there," Bob Kersee, her husband and coach, said. 
"Her speed is better than it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, tuning up for next month's heptathlon in the Goodwill Games at 
Seattle, was to put the shot later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She is the world record-holder and Olympic champion in the heptathlon and is 
seeking to break her mark of 7,291 points set at the Seoul Games. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite number this year is 73," Kersee said of the hopes he has for his 
wife of breaking the 7,300-point barrier. 
</P>
<P>
While expressing pleasure over the showing in the long jump qualifying, both 
Kersees were not completely satisfied because she missed the takeoff board. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to me was running relaxed today," Joyner-Kersee said. "I was forcing 
the speed. I get anxious when I'm long jumping." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee set the American record of 24-5 1/2 in the 1987 Pan American 
Games at Indianapolis.

BARNES, KIWIS SAIL TO FIRST-DAY SERIES LEAD; 
</P>
<P>
YACHTING: THEY MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES ON SAN DIEGO BAY BUT STILL LEAD ISLER AND 
U.S. BY JUST A POINT.

<P>
Considering he was a novice in a 68-foot maxi-sled and had never raced in the 
shifting winds of San Diego Harbor, New Zealand skipper David Barnes made a 
fair showing Friday in the first day of an eight-race series between the Kiwis 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes took two of three match races from Peter Isler, winning navigator in the 
last two America's Cups, and suffered his only loss by just six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in here with everything to gain and nothing to lose," Barnes said. 
"This is Peter's home turf, and these boats are foreign to us. We don't have 
any boats this size in our country." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes and his 10-member crew did get an opportunity to practice with the 
maxi-sleds for four days. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it shows that we're fast learners and quick to adapt to different 
conditions," Barnes said. "Rod Davis and Murray Jones work together all the 
time. They communicated well with me all day." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes and Davis, an 1984 Olympic gold medalist in soling, are ranked second on 
the World Match Racing Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Racing continues today and Sunday at 12:30 p.m. Friday's races were worth one 
point each. Saturday's three races count two points apiece and Sunday's two 
races are worth three points. 
</P>
<P>
So although Barnes and his crew made all the right moves Friday, he still only 
leads the series by one point. 
</P>
<P>
Isler, ranked as the No. 1 skipper in the United States and fifth in the world, 
said he wasn't surprised by the Kiwis' quick start. 
</P>
<P>
"You have many Olympic class people on that crew," Isler said. "It's always 
been tough to race against them." 
</P>
<P>
After Isler's boat took a quick lead in the opening race, Barnes and navigators 
Davis and Jones made several key decisions in the second leg that gave the New 
Zealand boat favorable wind. The Kiwis wound up winning by 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind shifts were critical," Isler said. "They played them beautifully, and 
we were a little out of phase. They had the advantage of being ahead. The lead 
boat gets to choose, and they made the right decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The second race took on many of the same characteristics as the first -- 
Isler's boat led early with the Kiwis' boat taking the lead after the first 
leg. But with the race a third over, the Kiwis were penalized for altering 
their course while on a starboard tack. They were immediately ordered by the 
three judges to make a circle. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said the penalty, which he said cost him six or seven boat lengths, was 
unjust. 
</P>
<P>
"It cost us the race," he said. "I know you're not supposed to alter your 
course, but we didn't have a chance to because of the big wind shift. We were 
nowhere near to coming close to them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Kiwis made up the time they lost and had an opportunity to win, but 
a late charge by Isler gave the United States the six-second victory. 
</P>
<P>
"(Isler) came with more pressure behind us," Barnes said. "We couldn't quite 
get an advantage before the last mark." 
</P>
<P>
The third race was the most lopsided. Barnes got off to an early lead and was 
never threatened. He led by more than a minute throughout and won by 51 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked the shifts quite well," said Barnes, a three-time world champion in 
Olympic class 470s. "We got the first shift right and basically ignored them 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
The crews switched boats after the second race Friday and will continue to 
switch throughout the series until each has sailed each boat four times.

Some would call it a love-hate relationship. One inning, the two are at each 
other's throat, arguing about everything from pitch selection to mound 
mechanics. A few minutes later, the thunderclouds part and dispositions are 
sunny. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth High pitcher Reed McMackin and catcher Mike Mancuso, who steered the 
team to the City Section 4-A Division championship two weeks ago, are sometimes 
at their best when they are at their worst. 
</P>
<P>
"They remind me of brothers," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "But I think 
they help fire each other up." 
</P>
<P>
The two will try to light a fire under their West teammates in today's Daily 
News all-star baseball game at Cal State Northridge at 4:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding the baseball game is the Daily News all-star softball game, scheduled 
for a 2:15 p.m. start at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin, selected the City 4-A co-Player of the Year along with Pat Treend of 
El Camino Real, is part of a formidable West pitching staff that includes Mike 
Eby of Westlake, Pat Bennett of Crespi, and Ryan McGuire and Treend of El 
Camino Real. The five were a combined 51-5 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The West outfield features three players -- Garret Anderson of Kennedy, Pat 
Bryant of Cleveland and Danny Larson of Birmingham -- who were selected in the 
first four rounds of the recent baseball amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
The East boasts seven players who were selected to The Times' All-Valley team. 
Stanford-bound Andrew Lorraine (9-0 with an earned-run average of 0.79) and San 
Fernando's John Najar (5-2, 2.05) lead the pitching corps. 
</P>
<P>
The East also will be solid up the middle behind shortstop Robby Davis (.451 
average, 26 runs batted in) and second baseman Lance Migita (.434, 30 RBIs) of 
Hart and Saugus catcher J. B. Johnson (.425, 30 RBIs), all of whom were Times 
All-Valley selections. 
</P>
<P>
Keyaan Cook of Montclair Prep, the Southern Section 1-A Division Player of the 
Year and an All-Valley pick, batted .551 with 33 RBIs and can play today at 
first base, shortstop or in the outfield. Third baseman Kendial Armstrong of 
Quartz Hill, who batted .420 with 32 RBIs, is another Times All-Valley 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
The East team is coached by Jerry Cord of Poly and Tom Moran of St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
West coaches are Rich Herrera of Westlake and Mike Maio of El Camino Real.

POWELL POSTS BACK-TO-BACK VENTURA WINS

Jim Powell Jr., 17, of Cypress drove to his second consecutive Street Stock 
15-lap main-event victory at Ventura Raceway on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Powell passed Don Green of Ventura on Lap 13 after Green, who had led the 
entire way, went high in the turn. 
</P>
<P>
Powell came from the 11th starting position to win his third main event of the 
season. Green finished second and Don Keeter of Ventura took third. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Raschke of Ventura improved his Mini Stock season points lead with a 
hard-fought victory in the 20-lap main event. The win gave Raschke his fourth 
main-event victory of the season, a high for all divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Rock Ake Jr. of Moorpark and Pat Garrety of Oxnard finished second and third. 
</P>
<P>
In his first victory of the season, Russ Warren of Ventura led wire to wire in 
the Mini Stock four-lap figure-eight main event, holding off a hard-charging 
Cory Kruseman of Ventura, who finished second. Joe Silva of Port Hueneme was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme took over the season points lead in the Street 
Stock figure-eight division with an easy 10-lap main event victory. Green was a 
distant second and Scott Olsen of Ventura finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Six-lap heat-race winners were Lynn Brader of Somis in the Street Stock 
division and Gary Curtis of Camarillo and Ake in the Mini Stock division.

THEY'RE OUTRACING WORLD IN OUTRIGGERS; 
</P>
<P>
CANOEING: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TEAMS ARE QUICKLY CATCHING UP TO THE HAWAIIANS 
AND TAHITIANS IN THIS ANCIENT SPORT.

The day when outrigger canoe racing becomes an Olympic sport might not be far 
off. Should that happen, the United States can almost count on a bushel full of 
medals. 
</P>
<P>
Why wouldn't Americans dominate the Olympics' first outrigger paddling event? 
After all, the sport was invented in Hawaii. But by 1996 or 2000, the best 
paddlers in the world could be from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds almost disrespectful, boats full of fair-haired mainlanders 
out-paddling the Pacific Rim for the gold. But such a thing has already 
happened in the Hawaiian Islands and off the coast of Tahiti, current home of 
the world's best racers. 
</P>
<P>
In today's La Jolla to Del Mar Ironman Championships, which start at 8:45 a.m. 
at La Jolla Shores, the entry list will include the current men's and women's 
world champions and record-holders in the Molokai to Oahu Challenge, this 
sport's Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The teams come from the Off Shore Canoeing Club. Address? Newport Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"The best long-distance paddlers in the world are in California, and we're 
closing the gap in the sprints," said Dee Van Winkle, coach and founder of the 
San Diego Outrigger Canoe Club. "And our women are just dominating." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Stephany, president of the San Diego-based Kai Elua Outrigger Canoe 
Club, host of the Ironman event: "The Californians have caught up, but we still 
don't have the depth and financial backing of the Tahitians and Hawaiians. If 
we got the funding like other sports in this country, there's no question we'd 
be better." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's three clubs -- the third is Hano Hano Outrigger Canoeing Club -- 
have played no small part in this surprising success. 
</P>
<P>
Today's event is the final race of the long-course season and will determine 
the 1990 state champions in six different categories, including men, women, 
masters and novices. Approximately 20 clubs are expected to compete. The 
Kalifornia Outrigger Assn., which sanctions the event, expects as many as 40 of 
these ancient six-man war canoes with pontoon-like "outrig" balance beams in 
the water for each race. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Outrigger's men have won the open division of this race -- a 15-miler 
that runs to Del Mar and back -- three of the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, San Diego Outrigger, like many California teams, approaches this 
sport as seriously as ancient Hawaiian men who, legend has it, sometimes 
wagered their wives on a race. Most of this four-year-old club's members don't 
just paddle but also run, swim, ride a bike, lift weights and watch their 
diets. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any recreational paddlers on our club," Van Winkle said. "We only 
race to win, and winning's fun." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, San Diego Outrigger's men and women swept the Ironman open competition 
and later swept the California sprint championships masters division. The club 
topped off the year with two championships and three second-place finishes at 
the International Polynesian Canoe Federation World Championships in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Van Winkle, 47, is sort of an outrigging guru in San Diego. He was a founding 
member of Kai Elua in 1979. He and fellow Kai Elua founder Egan Horcajo helped 
form Hano Hano in 1981 and build it into California's winningest club. 
</P>
<P>
Kai Elua has been slowed recently by a coaching change, and Hano Hano has taken 
a step back to reorganize. Both clubs are intent upon preserving a Polynesian 
spirit of paddling more for the pleasure than a prize. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having fun again," said Horcajo, the Hano Hano coach and president who 
began paddling as a teen-ager in Molokai. "Winning's fun, but we lost the 
camaraderie. We were all at each other's throats." 
</P>
<P>
But when Van Winkle formed San Diego Outrigger, those with a burning desire to 
win followed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very serious sport," he said. "There have been divorces and marriages 
gone on the rocks because of it." 
</P>
<P>
This all started in 1959 -- some 73 years after official racing on the Pacific 
Rim was first documented -- when a handful of native Hawaiians decided to 
introduce the sport on the mainland. Among them, according to Stephany, was 
Sandy Kahanamoku, a nephew of Duke Kahanamoku, a three-time U.S. Olympic 
swimming gold medalist who helped introduce surfing to the West Coast in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
But the pace really picked up in the 1980s, when California clubs switched from 
the traditional koawood canoes to fiberglass shells and started experimenting 
with new stroke techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are combining the Hawaiian stroke with a stroke used by the U.S. 
Olympic canoe team, and it's putting them right there with the Tahitians and 
Hawaiians," said Kai Elua paddler Tama Sotoa, a native of American Samoa, where 
outriggers are about as common as television sets are in the United States. 
"They're not leaning over the boat and pulling the paddle as much, and the boat 
doesn't rock as much. It's a smoother (and more efficient) ride." 
</P>
<P>
There is still a question whether a future Olympic organizing committee will 
take the first step and include outrigger canoeing as a demonstration sport in 
its program. Stephany said the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee took a 
hard look when the IPCF staged its first world sprint championships in Long 
Beach during the 1984 Games. Stephany and one of his Kai Elua teams earned two 
silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
Stephany said he had been told before the 1984 Games that 20 countries had to 
be participating in a sport for it to be considered for an Olympic exhibition. 
He said there are about 15 countries competing in outrigger canoeing now. 
</P>
<P>
Horcajo, whose Hano Hano team finished third behind two Tahitian teams in 1986 
world sprint championships, is waiting for the day the sport has an Olympic 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
"Tahiti puts its (best paddlers) together like Olympic teams," he said. "If we 
selected people that way, we'd blow their doors off." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Because the racing will take place approximately a mile and a half off the 
coast, spectators can only view the races from certain observation points. 
Suggested sites are the Torrey Pines cliffs area, with its hang glider port and 
a viewpoint above Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and vistas along the 
Pacific Coast Highway stretch between La Jolla and Del Mar. . . . Women's open 
and masters teams will start the racing at 8:45 a.m. Men's open and masters 
will race at 11:45 a.m., and novice men and women will compete at 2 p.m. . . . 
Races last approximately two hours. . . . The racing will be followed by a 
Polynesian festival at La Jolla Shores at 4 p.m.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU NAMES ASSISTANT IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Kubala has been named as an assistant women's basketball coach at San 
Diego State, Coach Beth Burns announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kubala replaces Lyn Anastasio, who is completing her master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
Kubala, 26, was an assistant at Kansas State last season, when the Wildcats 
went 20-10. She was the recruiting coordinator and specialized in developing 
post players. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Corpus Christi, Tex., she played as an undergraduate at New 
Mexico State for two seasons before transferring to Texas A&amp;M in 1983. Her 
playing career was then ended by a knee injury. She remained at Texas A&amp;M 
for six seasons -- four as a student assistant and two as a graduate assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she will immediately help us work with the big kids," Burns said. "And 
she's extremely well-organized, with good correspondence skills, which will 
help in recruiting."

MINOR LEAGUE REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
PITCHER ERB SUCCEEDING AFTER CAREER NEARLY WENT BY THE BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A little over two years ago, Jack Erb, who umpired high school and college 
games for 11 years, looked as if he had just broken up a bench-clearing brawl 
with his face. 
</P>
<P>
Black eye, cuts, he was a mess. 
</P>
<P>
What happened, Jack? 
</P>
<P>
He was just out catching his son. It seems Mike Erb could always bring it. 
</P>
<P>
Need a new catcher's mitt broken in? A few dozen Erb pitches at 20 paces should 
do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels thought enough of his right arm that they selected him in the first 
round in the 1987 June free agent draft. In three years at San Diego State, Erb 
had set the Aztecs' career strikeout record with 299 in 304 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have not been disappointed -- at least, not with his arm. 
</P>
<P>
During three-plus minor league seasons, Erb has proven his worth and is now 
leading the triple-A Edmonton Trappers with a 3-1 record and 3.18 earned run 
average. The ERA is fifth best in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
He was on the 40-man roster in spring training, but the lockout spoiled his 
chances of making the big league club. 
</P>
<P>
"I did well, but with the lockout, they knew what their set lineup was going to 
be, and those guys got all the innings," Erb said. 
</P>
<P>
But while his actions on the field have always been admirable -- even legendary 
at places such as USDHS and Madison High -- his off-field antics have long been 
a concern of administrators and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he's a troublemaker, criminal or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
No. Erb is a surfer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody perceives him that way," Jack Erb said. "But he brought it on 
himself. He promoted the image, and now he's got to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Another act he had to live with was when he transferred from USDHS to Madison 
at the beginning of his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with baseball," Erb said. 
</P>
<P>
It had to do with fun. Erb was no longer having any, and he wanted to transfer 
to where most of his friends were. 
</P>
<P>
The problem? 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were on vacation," Erb said. "They were in Hawaii, so I walked into 
my counselor's office and said, 'Give me my transcripts. I'm out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
"My parents weren't real happy. I was sweating bullets when I went to pick them 
up at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack, "We were not even in the house five minutes, when he said, 'Dad, can 
you come in the back room. I've got something to tell you.' " 
</P>
<P>
But that's all in the past, right, Mike? 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly. Believe it or not," Erb said. "I'm still the same person. I'll always 
be Mike Erb. But in order to get respect and not have this surfer image, I've 
got to portray a more serious role. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make changes, and I had to make them noticeable. Because I'm Mike 
Erb, I had to make them visible in order for them to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, said: "Mike Erb's a guy with a 
lot of natural ability. The ability has always been there. It's going to be his 
decision whether he wants to make use of it. He needed to make a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Over the winter, which Erb spent working out in Anaheim, Lachemann said he 
showed signs of improvement in that area. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in much better physical shape than he's ever been," Lachemann said. "He's 
lost some of that baby fat he used to have. 
</P>
<P>
"To his credit, he's turned the corner. Being in the doghouse once doesn't mean 
you're going to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
The doghouse, as far as the Angels were concerned, began for Erb when he was 
assigned to the Angels' Class-A club in Palm Springs in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He started out well but soon began driving back to San Diego after games so he 
could surf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get home about 1 (in the morning) and to bed about 2:30," he said. "Get up 
early. Eat. Surf. Get back for the game." 
</P>
<P>
Erb finished with a respectable 10-7 record, but his ERA rose to 4.40, and his 
strikeouts were down to 86 in 108 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to wake up to reality and blow that image off," he said. "I had to start 
taking baseball more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Erb was sent to Quad City, Iowa, of the Class-A Midwest League the next year 
and had a fine season. He finished 11-4 with a 2.69 ERA and 161 strikeouts in 
147 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack, "I think after the Palm Springs experience, Mike got to himself and 
decided he better take baseball more seriously or get out and do something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"He's finally made up his mind. He wants to be a pro baseball player. Son of a 
gun, I think he's going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Erb is one of many local prospects doing well for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis, a former Hoover High and Stanford outfielder, is hitting .267 with 
nine home runs and 26 runs batted in for Midland (double A). UC San Diego's 
Kyle Abbott (1-3, 5.59) and El Cajon Valley High's Andy Hall (injured) also 
play for Midland. 
</P>
<P>
At Quad City, Santana High's Mike Hook is 3-1 with a 0.47 ERA and 36 strikeouts 
in 19 1/3 innings. Santana's Jeff Gay, a catcher, is hitting .252 with three 
homers and 12 RBIs. La Mesa's John Marchese is 1-0 with a 2.91 ERA and 21 
strikeouts in 15 innings.

TELECREDIT TALKS MERGER WITH SEVERAL FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
BUYOUTS: ANALYSTS SAY THE BIG CHECK-GUARANTEE FIRM'S SUITORS COULD RANGE FROM A 
MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO A NATIONAL RETAILER. THE COMPANY'S STOCK SOARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Telecredit, one of the nation's largest check-guarantee firms, said Friday that 
it is holding merger talks with several unidentified firms. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent the stock of the Los Angeles-based company soaring. It 
closed at $52.50, up $9.375, in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Telecredit, which also processes credit card transactions for small- to 
medium-sized financial institutions, could fetch about $60 a share, or $661 
million, analysts said. Potential buyers could range from a major financial 
institution to a national retailer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a highly competitive environment, Telecredit commands about 50% of the 
check-authorization business, handling about $7 billion in checks annually. 
Typically, retailers call Telecredit to verify that customers' checks are good. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a lot of money at it, and they manage it really well," said 
electronics industry analyst Jackson Spears at First Chicago Corp. "This 
clearly is a good property." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, company Chairman Lee A. Ault said: "Although Telecredit has not 
determined that a business combination is its most attractive alternative, 
Telecredit believes it is in the best interests of its stockholders to explore 
the possibility of such a transaction." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials were not available for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1961, Telecredit pioneered the electronic check-guarantee business. 
The industry experienced rapid growth in the 1980s, despite a big increase in 
automated teller machines and other forms of electronic payment that do without 
checks or cash. 
</P>
<P>
The company branched into processing credit card transactions for credit unions 
and smaller banks and savings and loans. That niche allows it to avoid 
head-to-head competition with much larger firms, such as Citibank, said analyst 
Jordan Cox at Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co., a Washington-based investment banking 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Telecredit also set up a subsidiary, Light Signatures, to market an electronic 
system to thwart the counterfeiting of consumer goods. But the system was 
poorly received and Telecredit decided to phase out most of the subsidiary, 
which caused it to suffer a $7-million loss in fiscal 1988. The company 
licensed most of the anti-counterfeiting technology to other firms. 
</P>
<P>
The check-guarantee business remains Telecredit's largest money maker. It 
generated about 57% of the company's $158 million in revenues for fiscal 1989. 
Net income for the year totaled $24.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The check-guarantee business's annual growth has fallen to about 10% from 
historical highs of 18%, said Cox. But, he added, the lower rate remains 
impressive, given the huge volume of checks that Telecredit processes and the 
increased competition.

L.A. Trade Deficit Shrinks: Los Angeles-based Tradewatch said the first-quarter 
deficit for goods moving through the Los Angeles Customs District narrowed by 
24%. 
</P>
<P>
The private trade-tracking concern said imports were $15.6 billion and exports 
were $10.2 billion. The resulting $5.4-billion deficit was off $1.7 billion 
from the previous quarter. Japan was the leading importer, sending $5.7 billion 
in goods through the district. Taiwan was second with $1.8 billion, South Korea 
third with $1.5 billion. Japan remained the largest buyer of U.S. goods, with 
shipments of $2.6 billion. South Korea was second with $1.1 billion. Taiwan was 
third with $838 million.

Cineplex Odeon to Sell Some Theaters: The Toronto-based movie theater chain has 
agreed to sell 38 theaters with 150 screens in Utah, Idaho, Minnesota, Oregon 
and Washington (excluding the Seattle/Tacoma/Bellevue area) to Plitt Amusement 
Co. of Los Angeles for $31.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, subject to U.S. regulatory approval, is expected to close 
about July 31. Cineplex Odeon said the move is part of its effort to focus on 
its primary exhibition markets and reduce long-term debt. After the 
transaction, Cineplex Odeon will own 1,550 screens in 390 locations in the 
United States and Canada. Separately, Alan Karp was named chief executive of 
Cineplex.

U.S. AND JAPAN WORK ON INTERIM TRADE ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC RIM: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO MAKE TOKYO 'FLESH OUT' ITS APRIL 
PROMISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and Japan began serious efforts Friday to iron out their 
differences over a high-level interim accord that the two countries signed in 
April to help ease their trade frictions, but the outcome of the spat remained 
in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in San Francisco, Secretary of State James A. Baker III pointedly 
warned Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama that Japan must "flesh out" some 
of the promises it made in the April accord or risk reviving anti-Japanese 
sentiment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the meeting between Baker and Nakayama 
would be enough to turn around lower-level talks, in which U.S. officials have 
charged that Japan has been "stonewalling" American demands that Tokyo spell 
out the concessions it made in April. 
</P>
<P>
But participants in Friday's session said the tone of the talks provided some 
optimism that top Japanese leaders are beginning to take U.S. demands more 
seriously and may begin moving to provide the details Washington wants. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting marked the first Cabinet-level discussions between the two 
governments since the lower-level negotiations broke down two weeks ago. The 
negotiators are scheduled to meet again -- presumably for the last time -- June 
25-26. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, which contained the most sweeping pledges for economic 
restructuring negotiated by any two trading partners, involved a number of 
Japanese pledges, from significant deregulation of Tokyo's goods-distribution 
system to promises of a crackdown on bid rigging by Japanese construction 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
But the report clearly was intended as an interim step that would form the 
basis of a final report that the two sides would hammer out shortly before the 
annual seven-nation economic summit to be held July 9-11 in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants Japan to nail down several key concessions by providing 
specific numerical targets for Japanese pledges to boost government spending on 
public works projects and to increase penalties for violations of anti-monopoly 
laws -- lest they be watered down in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, lower-level Japanese officials had flatly refused to move ahead 
on any of the points that U.S. negotiators had raised, contending in effect 
that the interim report initialed in April was sufficient and that no further 
measures would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said the session Friday was devoid of any such posturing and 
that Nakayama had promised to carry the message back to top Japanese 
policy-makers -- a signal that frequently means that an issue is about to be 
considered more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Nakayama also took pains to assure the Administration that 
Japan did not intend to abandon efforts to reduce its balance of payments 
surplus with the United States, despite suggestions to that effect by some 
lower-level officials in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestions, contained in a report published two weeks ago by the Japanese 
Finance Ministry, enraged senior Bush Administration policy-makers, who had 
spent months persuading Tokyo to make payment reduction its top goal. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said if the June 25-26 meetings do not produce any results, the 
Administration may have to intensify its pressure -- possibly by involving 
President Bush directly in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.

KARCHER, WENDY'S SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises has settled a year-old lawsuit filed by Wendy's 
International over the Anaheim-based firm's purchase of 10 Wendy's locations in 
Arizona, the companies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's, a fast-food chain based in Dublin, Ohio, last June sued Karcher 
Enterprises and a Wendy's franchisee, Ronald Brown, after Brown sold his 
Wendy's locations to Karcher in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The locations are in Tucson, Flagstaff and Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's accused Karcher Enterprises of unlawfully interfering with Wendy's 
contractual relationships by buying the restaurants without Wendy's approval. 
The Wendy's suit sought $79 million in damages from Karcher Enterprises and $40 
million from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher Enterprises contended that the transaction was legal because it 
purchased the restaurants only after Wendy's rejected the chance to buy them 
from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, Wendy's agreed not to contest the sale and Karcher 
Enterprises agreed not to purchase other Wendy's franchises without prior 
written consent of the parent company. Other terms of the settlement were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution did not affect us materially from a financial or operational 
standpoint," said Loren Pannier, chief financial officer of Karcher. "After all 
the commotion, we're back at square one." 
</P>
<P>
With the suit settled, Karcher Enterprises is now free to resell the former 
Wendy's locations as part of its effort to scale down its Arizona operations. 
The company has said its Carl's Jr. restaurants in Arizona are losing $5 
million a year. In May, the company announced plans to close or sell all 40 of 
its Arizona units.

FRANCE BLOCKS PARRETTI BID FOR PATHE CINEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The French government blocked an attempt by Italian investor Giancarlo Parretti 
to take full control of France's Pathe Cinema, citing the bid as a threat to 
"public order." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Beverly Hills-based Pathe Communications Corp., of which Parretti 
is president, extended its $1.2-billion tender offer for MGM/UA Communications 
Co. until June 22. 
</P>
<P>
The extension came as Pathe and MGM/UA officers discussed the possibility of a 
much longer delay if Pathe fails to work out details of an agreement with Time 
Warner Inc., its major backer, an individual familiar with the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
The tender offer, which had been extended before, was set to expire Friday. But 
Pathe has until June 23 to complete its offer under an agreement with MGM/UA's 
majority shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian. 
</P>
<P>
A Pathe spokesman said only that the offer's closing was delayed because of the 
complexity of Pathe's financial arrangements, which have not yet been 
completed. They involve a patchwork of short-term bank loans and advances, and 
$650 million from Time Warner in exchange for the right to distribute MGM, 
United Artists and Pathe films for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
As of late Friday, Parretti was still in talks with Time Warner executives and 
was separately discussing a contingency plan under which he might extend his 
offer for as long as three months while seeking a new backer if the 
negotiations with Time Warner fail, individuals close to the discussions said. 
</P>
<P>
"A proposal (to extend for three months) has been made. I'm not sure if Kirk 
has accepted it," one of the individuals said. 
</P>
<P>
One unresolved point has been Pathe's ability to finance new pictures once it 
completes the acquisition. According to a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission earlier this week, Pathe has proposed to provide $125 
million in production financing, rather than the $200 million required by its 
Warner agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The action by France's Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, followed an intense 
public debate in that country over Parretti's bid to pay about $167 million for 
the 52% of Pathe Cinema that it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe Cinema is a major French movie and TV producer with a 400-film library 
and a chain of about 150 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
French officials had previously raised, and then dropped, a claim that 
Parretti's purchase should be blocked because much of the funding came from a 
company owned by Pathe Chairman Florio Fiorini. The French had initially 
objected because Fiorini's company is based in Switzerland, which isn't a 
member of the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the government's latest move, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said 
"rumors" about people involved with the deal were sufficiently serious to 
justify postponing it, according to a report by Reuters. The spokeswoman didn't 
elaborate, Reuters said. 
</P>
<P>
A threat to public order is one of the few grounds on which French officials 
are permitted to block a bid from within the EC. 
</P>
<P>
A Pathe spokesman in Paris, Salvatore Picciotto, was quoted by Reuters as 
maintaining that "what Beregovoy has done is only postpone a decision. It is 
not a veto. It just means he is saying, 'I will not give my ruling today.' That 
is all." 
</P>
<P>
Pathe's representative in Los Angeles, Craig Parsons, said he didn't expect the 
European controversy to hamper Pathe's bid for MGM/UA.

AMERICAN CONTINENTAL'S LAW FIRM WILL PAY BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York law firm representing bankrupt American Continental Corp., parent of 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, agreed Friday to pay the company's 
bondholders $20 million to settle a lawsuit charging it with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement with the firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler 
gives debt holders, who invested about $250 million in Phoenix-based American 
Continental, about eight cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
It also reduces a previous $14.3-million settlement with a Los Angeles law firm 
to $4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Both settlements must be approved by a federal court judge. One other law firm 
and three accounting firms remain as defendants along with a host of American 
Continental directors and officers. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Rus, a lawyer for debt holders, called the Kaye, Scholer settlement 
significant. "It shows there is a real likelihood of liability by those who 
contributed to the continuing fraud perpetrated by American Continental," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Kaye, Scholer partner, however, denied any liability, saying the firm settled 
the case reluctantly. "No state or federal agency has accused us of doing 
anything wrong," said the partner, Kenneth R. Feinberg. 
</P>
<P>
He said the firm's insurance carrier will pay the entire amount. 
</P>
<P>
"We also felt that we should settle because of the uncertainty of going 
forward, the time it would take and the dollars it would take, both in cost and 
in partner time," he said. "We felt a settlement was a better course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 holders of five debt offerings lost about $250 million when 
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989. Federal 
regulators seized Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift now is predicted to become one of the nation's most expensive 
failures, costing taxpayers $2 billion or more.

MAKING SENSE OF LIVE CREW FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
CENSORSHIP: A CONTROVERSIAL OBSCENITY RULING NOT ONLY SEEMS MISGUIDED BUT MAKES 
STARS OF AN UNDISTINGUISHED RAP GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lesson of the 2 Live Crew case, once again, is that censorship doesn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
In declaring the group's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album obscene, U.S. 
District Court Judge Jose Gonzalez has turned what was a mostly undistinguished 
and relatively underground act into the most famous attraction in rap. And he 
did it virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
2 Dull Crew has in the last 10 days become 2 Lucky Crew. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's ruling won't be any more effective in protecting public morals than 
moves in the '50s that resulted in hip-swinging Elvis Presley being shown only 
from the waist up on the Ed Sullivan television show or the Rolling Stones in 
the '60s having to change the words of "Let's Spend the Night Together" to 
"Let's Spend Some Time Together" for the Sullivan show. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those measures, which curbed actions or language that now seems almost 
quaint, only heightened the appeal of the two acts. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of 2 Live Crew, the courts will undoubtedly overturn the ruling at 
some point. In the meantime, 2 Live Crew is certain to sell several hundred 
thousand more copies of its "Nasty" album because of the curiosity stirred up 
by the judge's decision and subsequent arrests of two group members and a 
record store owner. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Gonzalez ruling, 2 Live Crew -- thanks, in considerable part, 
to the notoriety surrounding two earlier albums -- had generated sufficient 
interest to sell 1.7 million copies of the "Nasty" album. 
</P>
<P>
While the threat of legal action is keeping the album off the shelves in 
hundreds of record shops, there are plenty of copies available. In fact, each 
of the dozen record stores questioned this week in the Los Angeles area 
reported a dramatic increase in requests for the album -- but most of the 
stores were temporarily out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the advance orders for the group's cleverly titled and timed follow-up 
album. Due July 4 from 2 Live Crew: "Banned in the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
What will the curious find in the "Nasty" album? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, all the "dirty" words that have apparently shocked the judge and 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
But the album, which comes with a warning imprinted on the cover that there is 
"explicit language contained," mixes its exaggerated, no-words-spared tales of 
sexual fantasies and a contemporary hip-hop music style with a degree of 
artistic ambition and imagination -- however shallow -- that lifts it beyond 
the typical X-rated adult-bookstore fare. 
</P>
<P>
"Nasty," in fact, combines two pop culture traditions: the suggestiveness of 
rock 'n' roll and the bawdy humor of "party" or "stag" comedy albums. 
</P>
<P>
Sex was part of rock culture even before Elvis shook his hips. Some of the most 
celebrated of the mid-'50s, R&amp;B novelty hits that led to the birth of rock 
featured songs built around sexual innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone at the time doubted the real meaning of "Work With Me Annie" (a song 
recorded by Hank Ballard, who would later write "The Twist"), the mystery was 
solved with Ballard's follow-up single, "Annie Had a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
2 Live Crew, in keeping with the easing of restrictions against sexual images 
and activities in film and print since the '50s, offers the sex without the 
innuendo, thereby connecting with the X-rated comedy of such personalities as 
Redd Foxx and Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown that led the judge in Florida to declare the "Nasty" album obscene 
-- "an appeal to dirty thoughts and the loins, not to the intellect and the 
mind," Gonzalez wrote in his 62-page opinion -- easily could have been handed 
down two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All the crude four- and five-letter words and sound bites of women simulating 
sexual ecstasy that are found in "Nasty" were also present in 2 Live Crew's 
second album, "Move Somethin'." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the lines in the song, "S &amp; M," contain the usual sexual 
expletives, words that are beyond the bounds of what can be printed in a 
mass-circulation newspaper such as The Times. 
</P>
<P>
One set of rhymes, which can be printed, raps about a woman who supposedly 
wants to be treated like a "sex slave": 
</P>
<P>
 I can see it in your eyes 
</P>
<P>
 The devil's deep inside 
</P>
<P>
 You're a masochistic freak 
</P>
<P>
 In disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on one's attitudes and sensibilities, the song -- with its satanic 
references and brutal images -- can be seen as encouraging unhealthy sexual 
activities or it can be seen as mocking sadomasochistic fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Two other tracks on the album are clearly humorous in design and work off two 
classic, mid-'60s rock hits, Manfred Mann's "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" and the Kinks' 
"All of the Day and All of the Night." 
</P>
<P>
The words to "One and One," which uses the Kinks melody, is in the playful, 
nursery-rhyme style of such Chuck Berry hits as "My Ding-a-Ling" and "Reelin' 
&amp; Rockin'." 
</P>
<P>
While some "One and One" lyrics, too, are unprintable, others give a direction 
of the song -- and the level of 2 Live Crew's humor: 
</P>
<P>
 One and one 
</P>
<P>
 We're havin' some fun 
</P>
<P>
 In the bedroom 
</P>
<P>
 All day and all of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and two 
</P>
<P>
 I took off my shoes . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Three and three 
</P>
<P>
 She undressed me . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Four and four 
</P>
<P>
 We f----- on the floor 
</P>
<P>
 In the bedroom 
</P>
<P>
 All day and all of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the songs, however, are more hard-core, language-wise, than "One and 
One." "Nasty" continues with more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Little, if any, of the three 2 Live Crew albums is any more sexually arousing 
than a comedy routine. Its value -- however measured -- is in its humor. You 
either laugh or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez didn't laugh, presumably, and he doesn't believe anyone else should 
even be allowed to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
It's fine if he is trying to save everyone from wasting their money on the 
album, but he's dealing with Constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
There have been charges of racism in the attack on "Nasty." Why declare obscene 
2 Live Crew, whose members are black, and not Andrew Dice Clay, who is white 
and whose frequently raunchy albums sit side by side 2 Live Crew in some 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
There also have been fears raised in the pop community that the obscenity 
decision is a reaction to growing pressures for some type of control over 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
But the whole incident could just be simply a series of freak circumstances -- 
the right crusader stumbling onto the right sheriff and then the right judge. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court guidelines of the Miller v. California 
obscenity test, something can be declared obscene only if it is patently 
offensive to community standards, appeals primarily to prurient interest and 
lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 Live Crew "Nasty" album clearly has some artistic ambition, which alone 
should be enough to keep it from being declared obscene under the Supreme Court 
test. 
</P>
<P>
But it's even more remarkable that the issue has gotten this far when one 
considers that the judge's decision was handed down in a community where sex 
shops carrying hundreds of X-rated videos and magazines rub shoulders with 
topless bars and strip joints. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the album probably would be dismissed as too tame by those who 
frequent adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The country can get along without the 2 Live Crew albums, but not at the price 
of a compromising the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment.

POLSKY AND ELGART PREMIERES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ostensibly, they were sharing a program. But when Rose Polsky and Sarah Elgart, 
along with their respective companies, actually put foot to board for 
Thursday's Generator Eight Festival at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, the 
divvying up looked far from even. Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Polsky proved, with her entry (against three of Elgart's), that less is 
emphatically more, that a subject plumbed and long thought about resonates in 
the mind's eye -- while a hastily made collage vanishes with the first blink. 
</P>
<P>
But Polsky does her best work as a soloist. In "Broken," which had its premiere 
on this agenda, the compelling sections were those with the choreographer alone 
and with Don Bondi, who danced in aggressive double-time around her as she 
slowly evoked a hyper-personal and poetic consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The piece is about AIDS and focuses on a male couple, only one of whom is dying 
at first. It engages a corps that, somewhat simplistically, portrays a 
harmonious community coming to terms with this disease holocaust. And it relies 
at times on melodramatic cliches as well as graphic enactments of illness and 
tragic realizations. 
</P>
<P>
But there are inspired moments, too, even without Polsky on the scene. When the 
couple stands still, listening to a train on an inexorable course, one knows 
what it must have been like to face such a transport to a death camp. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is the narrator of this tale, Polsky, who manages to say more about 
Pieta and pathos with a few divinely legible movements -- arcing, upper-body 
turns and hand-flutterings and somnambulistic chaines -- than all the rest put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
For the remaining two-thirds of the evening Elgart held forth. Her premiere 
"Sleepless," might not have seemed so shallow and thrown-together had it stood 
alone. But following "Eleventhour" (also about AIDS) and "Zoo," one could 
detect a sameness of method, and a glib, crank-'em-out mentality to her work. 
</P>
<P>
What you get is a theme, more or less coherent, and a squad of dancers doing 
semaphoric calisthenics or gestures-in-code. The kicker for "Sleepless" 
involves a late-night disc jockey a la Jean Shephard, sitting at sidestage, and 
an insomniac corps -- flailing, rocking, gyrating, waltzing, bumping and 
humping to the groans of a band called Skinny Puppy.

WATTS STUDENTS SPEAK AVANT-GARDE 'LANGUAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the talk these days about the new Los Angeles, it makes sense that 
avant-garde artists would be among the first to make hay out of the 
multicultural mix. 
</P>
<P>
And so they now have. In a multidiscipline environmental performance as 
eclectic as this city, three artists have joined forces in a unique 
collaboration with a group of students from the Scheenway School and Community 
Center in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporating everything from rap to shadow puppets to abstract sculpture, "No 
One Language" will take place as part of the Sited Works juried competition at 
Barnsdall Art Park, today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The question the work asks, says project director Deborah Oliver, is "how 
communication can happen" in a polyglot city like L.A. where dozens of 
languages may be spoken at a single high school. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, as you'd expect, is complex. 
</P>
<P>
In what choreographer Oliver describes as a "filmic, visual landscape," a 
narrative centered around a movable cement block sculpture takes shape. 
</P>
<P>
That sculpture, by Brazilian-born Chu-hsien Chang, has cubes and ropes that 
suggest, as Oliver puts it, "luggage carried by Ellis Island immigrants, the 
freeway system or territorial boundaries. What does it mean to have barriers, 
or to carry something around with you, and how does that get in the way?" 
</P>
<P>
Two "dream sequences" in "No One Language" feature live gamelan music and 
Balinese shadow puppetry by Maria Bodmann, leader of the Shadow Art Ensemble of 
Los Angeles, a group that will be performing at the L.A. County Museum next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
And added to all this is rap music performed live by eight students, ages 12 to 
16, from Watts. 
</P>
<P>
The way in which all these diverse elements came together is a model for the 
issues the piece addresses, according to Oliver. "We had a major conflict about 
how to incorporate the children," she admits. "(Bodmann and Chang) thought the 
rap was out of context, and I said, 'That's the whole idea.' " 
</P>
<P>
Just as Bodmann's task in the project was to figure out "How to take something 
that's Balinese and make it fit Los Angeles," the group had to negotiate a way 
to work together. 
</P>
<P>
For Oliver especially, it was a rocky road. "It was a real challenge for me to 
take myself out of my peer group," she says. "It was not easy for me to go down 
to Scheenway because I thought they wouldn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I ask (the students) to act like modern (performance artists)? Or do I say, 
'What do you have to contribute to the piece?' " asks Oliver. "The students 
were totally into telling me what they thought would work. Part of me wanted to 
tell them, but then I realized that's the whole idea: I have to be informed by 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"Collaboration is the way art is going to survive," she ventures. "It's a sign 
of the times that walls are breaking down and you have to deal with the person 
next door to you. I can't just sit in my studio alone and make work anymore."

SOLD-OUT PLAYBOY CELEBRATION ISN'T SINGING THE FESTIVAL BLUES; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: IN UNCERTAIN TIMES FOR FESTIVALS, THE ANNUAL PLAYBOY CONCERTS BRIDGE THE 
GENERATION GAP WITH A BLEND OF OLD AND NEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Playboy Jazz Festival makes its annual appearance at the Hollywood Bowl 
this weekend in an atmosphere of uncertainty for jazz. The recent deaths of 
Sarah Vaughan and Dexter Gordon have underscored both the importance and the 
fragility of the icon generation of jazz artists. For many of the music's most 
avid listeners, jazz is almost inconceivable without the presence of figures 
like Vaughan, Gordon and others of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been a good year," said festival producer George Wein. "We've always 
had a Sarah Vaughan concert as part of our New York Festival, and I've got no 
one to replace her with. There's just going to be a blank space on our 
schedule. People like Sarah and Dexter can't be replaced. And that's a real 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Wein is the world's busiest producer of jazz festivals. ("We may not all love 
him, all the time," said one musician who asked for anonymity, "but George has 
probably employed more jazz musicians than anybody else in the entire history 
of the music.") As a practical businessman, he tries to make adjustments as 
conditions change, but his faith in jazz is wavering. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not thrilled by a lot of the new music I hear," Wein said, "and 
there's not much coming down the pike to replace the old music." 
</P>
<P>
Jazz record producer Michael Cuscuna noted that in the late '60s and '70s most 
young musicians turned to rock instead of jazz. "An entire generation of jazz 
musicians just never appeared," Cuscuna said. "Which is why there are so few 
major players in their 30s and 40s." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's Playboy Jazz Festival, however, is one of the events that seems 
impervious to generation gaps. With Miles Davis, Lionel Hampton and Gerry 
Mulligan topping programs that balance traditional rhythms with contemporary 
sounds, the festival is once again a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
"Some festivals are like that," Wein explained. "They just have the right 
ambience. I have a number of events that sell out in advance, even though 
people don't know who's playing. Audiences come to some festivals -- to 
Playboy, to Saratoga, to Newport, to New Orleans, to Jimmy Lyons' Monterey 
Festival -- for the atmosphere and the ambience, and they'll always do well." 
</P>
<P>
Other festivals are more problematic. Wein sees growing difficulties in venues 
with large halls and extended dates. 
</P>
<P>
"I do concerts in 1,000-seat halls with world-famous musicians and sometimes I 
sell 300 or 400 tickets. In a lot of cases I'd be happy to just break even, or 
maybe come out at a slight deficit, which would be OK because the sponsor money 
would at least keep us going. But sometimes I can't even do that." 
</P>
<P>
Wein sees a possible solution in smaller halls and reduced budgets. Over the 
years, he has tried to keep his festivals in touch with changing trends via 
infusions of contemporary jazz, funk, fusion and world music. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is the development of more atmosphere-styled festivals, 
like the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, which spreads across the 
infield of a race track. Music is performed on 11 different stages and the 
grounds are filled with food stands and folk artisans. The Grande Parade Du 
Jazz in Nice is located in the even more atmospheric setting of the Cimiez 
Gardens, with music spread around three different stages. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in love with the idea of more ambience, more world music," said Wein, 
"but if it helps keep the festivals alive, we'll do it, even though it's not 
the route that I'm looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Cuscuna feels one of the solutions is for still-active veterans like Art 
Blakey, Max Roach and Dizzy Gillespie to provide leadership, maturity and a 
point of view for the emerging generation of acoustically oriented musicians. 
"But there just aren't enough guys -- nurturing leaders -- like that around," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to play people like Duke Ellington for $4,000 a week," Wein recalled. 
"Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald cost $2,500 a week, and Basie's band, $3,350 
a week. Once we started with them, it was only a matter of time before they 
jumped out to a larger level. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it can happen again. I'm not sure. But I do know that, from my point of 
view, I'd be happy to hear more rhythm sections playing a swinging, 
straight-ahead, be-bop beat."

POIROT MEETS HIS MAKER IN A&amp;E'S 'MURDER BY THE BOOK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hercule Poirot, all greased and arrogant as usual, has come to investigate a 
murder -- his own. 
</P>
<P>
And when he learns that it will not be an interesting murder but a simple, 
mundane and everyday heart attack, he is furious. 
</P>
<P>
(We know his ego.) He insists to his Maker that he "wants a proper death worthy 
of both of us!" 
</P>
<P>
"Murder by the Book," an hour drama airing Sunday at 5 p.m. and again at 9 p.m. 
on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network, is written and produced by Nick 
Evans and stars Ian Holm as the wily Belgian and Peggy Ashcroft as his Maker, 
Agatha Christie. 
</P>
<P>
As the story here has it, Christie wrote the final book on Poirot 35 years ago, 
putting him to eternal rest. But she was talked out of publishing it -- until 
now. Poirot hears of this and turns up in the night. 
</P>
<P>
It's a romp, these old-pro actors doing old-pro masterminds of murder, 
battering each other with repartee and screaming frustrations. Agatha is 
jealous that everybody is always asking about Poirot, Poirot, Poirot. He rages 
that, after all, it is he who sells all her books -- and he has never forgiven 
her tiny little brain cells for composing him as some silly, "narcissistic 
penguin." 
</P>
<P>
Reason expended on both sides, they invoke knives and guns and Agatha's special 
favorite, poison. 
</P>
<P>
We can't divulge the ending except to report the most obvious fact -- that 
these folks will never die. IRV LETOFSKY

JAMES MOODY AT ELARIO'S: MORE THAN JUST SAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jazzman James Moody says that a true master can handle many instruments with 
equal ease. Wednesday, the first of his five nights at Elario's, he proved that 
he practices what he preaches. Exotic streams of bebop-based invention came 
from tenor and alto saxes and flute, and even his quirky singing voice. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by locals Bob Magnusson on bass, Jim Plank on drums and Harry Pickens on 
piano, Moody started off on tenor for Tadd Dameron's "Good Faith," with 
extended solos by Moody and Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
Next came "Yesterdays" (by Jerome Kern, not Paul McCartney), with Moody 
switching to flute. Pickens settled in as the rhythm section's glue, building 
rhythmic undercurrents with his subtle chord combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens' gave his right hand the full run of the keyboard on an extended solo. 
He's a thoughtful, percussive player reminiscent of McCoy Tyner, but with a 
more cerebral, calculating approach. 
</P>
<P>
On saxes, Moody shows the same kind of intensity that characterized his 
earliest work with Dizzy Gillespie in the late 1940s. Long strings of notes 
tumbled out with a precision that forced both an intellectual and emotional 
response. How does a guy play so fast without the squeals and squeaks that 
sneak from the horns of mere mortals? 
</P>
<P>
"Moody's Mood for Love" featured Moody's facile voice handling both male and 
female parts in a love dialogue. He also sang "Happy Birthday" to a friend in 
the audience, improvising a series of exotic yodels. There's an album worth of 
singing in this guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I Can't Get Started With You," a tender ballad, provided the first set's 
highlight, as Moody hoisted his alto to put on an amazing display of 
virtuosity, sliding from bright, clear highs to buttery smooth lows. 
</P>
<P>
If there was an overall disappointment, it was that he often yielded solo space 
when his own playing was just hitting the hot zone, especially on "Cherokee" 
and "Hey Jim."

VANDROSS GENTLY TURNS UP THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a way, the two leading Luthers in black pop follow a similar premise: their 
songs are designed to stir hormones into action. 
</P>
<P>
Opening a sold-out stand of six concerts at the Celebrity Theatre on Thursday 
night, Luther Vandross fessed up to the fact that his music is aimed at 
spurring steamy thoughts and deeds. 
</P>
<P>
"See, the love songs, they work," the affable singer told his audience, 
virtually all of whom were stylishly turned out and above the age of consent. 
"I know what you all are going to do when you leave here tonight. I plan on 
doing a little of it myself." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in South Florida have held that the other Luther -- Luther 
Campbell, leader of the notorious rap group 2 Live Crew -- is breaking the law 
by performing songs with an overall intent similar to that of Vandross: appeal 
to an audience's interest in sex. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, methodology, terminology and attitude make all the difference, 
artistically if not constitutionally. 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell brought his act to the Celebrity last year, his show was an 
embarrassment. The 2 Live Crew's filth-stained raps reduced sex to an 
exploitative, mechanistic linkage ofbody parts. Campbell's puerile raps were 
nothing that should be banned in a society that values free speech, but they 
eminently deserved to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
While Vandross' music also is geared to serve as prelude to more than a kiss, 
the aphrodisiac he offers is romantic love, not raw sex. His show Thursday was 
a gentle and suave seduction delivered by one of the most accomplished and 
purely listenable male voices on the current pop scene. 
</P>
<P>
Vandross has an ideal voice for delivering the big romantic statement. It is 
smooth, flexible and effortless, capable of fluttering aloft to convey rising 
passion, or dropping deep down in a display of husky ardor. Like fine, polished 
mahogany, Vandross' voice has a well-defined grain to it, giving his singing 
exceptional body, contrast and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
It seems the only limit Vandross has is one of temperament, not talent. He is 
disposed toward suave romance, when something more raucous and rocking, 
something hot-blooded, funky, and explosively physical, can make a show take 
off. None of that was forthcoming at the Celebrity, at least not from Vandross. 
Backup singer Ava Cherry's sassy reheating of "I Heard It Through the 
Grapevine" was the show's only brief burst of high-energy soul. When everything 
seemed primed for a rousing close, Vandross could do no better than a mildly 
rhythmic hit, "Never Too Much." 
</P>
<P>
Within his limits, though, Vandross was able to unfold a reasonably well-paced 
90-minute show that included enough songs of briskly percolating rhythm to keep 
the set from becoming bogged down with ballads. 
</P>
<P>
Ballads, though, formed the center of the show's appeal. Vandross connected 
with fervent readings of two melancholy standards, Leon Russell's "Superstar" 
and the Burt Bacharach and Hal David composition "A House Is Not a Home." Like 
most of his songs, Vandross gave them extended, unhurried treatments in which 
the song itself became a departure point for a good deal of vocal vamping. 
</P>
<P>
While Vandross could profitably have pared down some of those elongated 
numbers, his passages of note-stretching, word-contorting display were not the 
forced attempts to dazzle that often crop up among accomplished pop-R&amp;B 
singers. As he extended songs, Vandross did not lose sight of their emotional 
point. Rather than trying to grandstand and oversing, he would stay under 
control and successfully hold a song's mood amid his embellishments. However, 
Vandross was too fond of gimmicky echo effects, resorting several times to an 
electronic delay treatment that allowed him almost to duet with himself. 
</P>
<P>
After playing arenas on previous tours, Vandross adjusted to the intimacy of 
the 2,500-seat, in-the-round theater with mostly apt staging that brought some 
lavish, big-venue touches to the smaller setting. With an effective, 
understated band confined to the orchestra pit, stage smoke and swirling lights 
bathed the entire stage at key moments, underscoring the romantic drama. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, three backup singer-dancers sometimes drew attention away 
from Vandross. Early in the show, they glided about in pose-striking simulated 
slow-motion that would have been more appropriate to a modeling runway than a 
concert stage. The choreography made more sense when the dancers moved in place 
at their microphones, Motown style. The idea might have been to create some 
visual excitement around Vandross, who isn't exactly a Magic Johnson (an 
attendee at this show) when it comes to floor moves. But a lot of the dance 
bits were corny or obvious play-acting. At his best, the trim-looking Vandross, 
who appeared to be winning his up-and-down fight to keep his weight under 
control, walked the stage alone, and held the eye through the force of the 
romantic ardor in his singing.

MUSEUM'S ARCHITECT: FIRST CHOICE WAS BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a person who appreciates innovative architecture, I was distressed about the 
news coverage in Zan Dubin's informative article "New Architect for Museum Is 
Identified" (June 5) concerning the underhanded choice of a second architect, 
William Pedersen, to "revise" Renzo Piano's design for the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of your readers, I have been to Paris and experienced the 
irrepressible, liberating cheerfulness and user-friendliness of the Centre 
Pompidou designed by Piano -- -- which, among other features, sports the most 
accessible library and mediatheque on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many readers, however, I have also been to Cincinnati to view architect 
Pedersen's reputed masterwork, the Procter &amp; Gamble headquarters, which I 
found to be a leaden, gray, monumentalist design of corporate elephantiasis, 
cut off from its urban environment and exuding colossal boredom. 
</P>
<P>
I am disturbed by the stealth with which trustees and donors of the museum have 
acted here, particularly Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren and Fluor Daniel 
Chairman David Tappan -- even when they have no right to impose their tastes, 
but should defer to experts trained in the arts. This corporate form of 
meddling reminds me of Sen. Jesse Helms' notions about what constitutes "good" 
and "bad" art and recent moves to hamstring the National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
And to think that Orange County was just the place for imaginative design, that 
we could have had our own Centre Pompidou or Menil Collection museum! Too bad. 
Looks like we'll get a humongous soapbox instead.

O.C.'S ECONOMY HURT BY LOSS IN MANUFACTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The continuing movement of manufacturers out of Orange County is having a more 
negative impact on the local economy than the loss of defense-related jobs from 
federal budget cuts, a Chapman College economist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This manufacturing flight, generally unrelated to the defense cutbacks, has 
occurred largely as a result of high labor costs and the difficulty of meeting 
costly and ill-defined environmental standards," said economist James Doti in a 
midyear update of Chapman's annual Orange County economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus of manufacturers is already having an impact on real estate -- 
slowing housing construction and price rises, according to the study by the 
private college's Center for Economic Research. The projections are produced 
from various data fed into a computerized econometric model. 
</P>
<P>
Presented to an audience of about 180 executives, the study -- considered the 
most comprehensive and accurate look at the county's economy available -- 
projected employment growth in the county to remain low but to increase by 2%, 
or 24,000 jobs, this year rather than the 1.5%, or 18,000 jobs, predicted in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs-creation estimate "still calls for a continuation of the downward 
trend that began in 1988," Doti said in an interview. One result, he said, is 
that for the first time since 1982, the county's employment-growth rate will be 
mirroring the state and national rates rather than outpacing them. 
</P>
<P>
The local economic picture was drawn on the backdrop of a "near recession-like 
national economy with low productivity levels and a core rate of inflation that 
remains stubbornly high." 
</P>
<P>
While it is widely feared that massive defense cuts will cripple the Orange 
County economy, the study projects that the impact will be less severe than in 
past downturns because the local economy is more diversified today. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said that in a worse-case scenario -- a 4% drop in national defense 
spending this year, a 10% decline next year and an 11.5% cutback in 1991 -- the 
area would lose only 6,000 jobs, or 0.5% of current wage and salary employment 
levels, by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
That is much less than 20 years ago with the defense cutbacks that accompanied 
the end of the Vietnam War. From 1967 to 1971, the county lost nearly 22,500 
defense jobs, or about 5.2% of total wage and salary employment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A broader perspective suggests that the Orange County economy will be much 
more resilent to defense purchase shocks than it was in earlier periods," Doti 
said, noting, however, that there will be indirect negative impacts caused by 
any job losses. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger problem than defense cutbacks is the shrinkage of the county's 
manufacturing base. In an interview, Doti said that those leaving the county 
are no longer limited to dirty, labor-intensive plants but now include even 
newer, high-technology operations. 
</P>
<P>
The drain is rooted in the increasing cost of doing business in Orange County, 
including high wages and expenses related to meeting stringent state and 
federal pollution standards. Several firms -- furniture makers, paint 
manufacturers and lock makers -- have announced plans to move in the last year 
because of environmental regulations, high land values and labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
"These costs make it difficult for a manufacturing concern to survive in an 
increasingly competitive global marketplace," Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of manufacturers also makes it more difficult for other parts of the 
county's economy to function well. 
</P>
<P>
"While manufacturing accounts for only 21% of total employment, it should be 
noted that many jobs in the construction and service-related sectors of the 
local economy are dependant on a healthy local manufacturing base," the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said that he and other economists at Chapman are beginning to see evidence 
that "we may be moving beyond the state where manufacturing firms stayed here 
and just did their expansions elsewhere. We may begin seeing a lot more 
manufacturers pulling up stakes and moving out completely." 
</P>
<P>
One result of the manufacturing flight, Doti said, has been to lower the demand 
for local housing. The study predicts a 9.1% drop in total new building 
valuation in the county this year and Doti said almost all of the decline "is 
coming out of the hide of residential valuation." 
</P>
<P>
He expects builders to take out permits for only 14,850 dwelling units this 
year, the lowest annual total since 1983 and down from 24,900 at the peak of 
the building boom in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the drop in demand, Doti said, is that the higher-paid 
manufacturing workers are being replaced by lower-paid, service-sector 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The fall in housing demand has already affected appreciation in local prices. 
The Chapman study projects a slight increase in prices this year -- about 3% to 
4%, which is below the projected 4.5% inflation rate for 1990. That represents 
a steep plunge from the 24% rise in housing prices in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
FEWER JOBS, MORE HOUSES 
</P>
<P>
The increasing cost of doing business in Orange County is driving manufacturers 
elsewhere, pushing down demand for housing and dampening appreciation rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The County's Changing Employment Base 
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs is expected to continue shrinking this year in the high 
technology sector, which includes most defense-related industries, and 
durable-goods manufacturing. An accompanying decline in construction is 
predicted, as well. 
</P>
<P>

O.C. DEMOCRATS FINED FOR 1986 RACE VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER and LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of Orange County's most prominent Democrats agreed Friday to pay $10,000 
each to settle civil charges they failed to disclose the source of $89,000 in 
campaign loans in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Former State Democratic Party Chairman Richard O'Neill and former U.S. Rep. 
Jerry Patterson acknowledged Friday that they did not properly disclose that 
O'Neill had co-signed two bank loans for Patterson's 1986 race for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson called the civil charges politically motivated to help Orange County 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, who announced the lawsuit and settlement 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill could not be reached for comment, but Patterson charged that Capizzi 
was seeking publicity in acting four years after the campaign-law violation, 
which he called "super-technical." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Capizzi is in a hotly contested runoff election, Patterson said: "I 
think it's press-motivated. . . . I don't understand why it went on so long and 
then just three weeks before this (June 5) election, it came up." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, a Republican, rejected Patterson's contentions. "I hold a nonpartisan 
office and will apply the law in a nonpartisan fashion," he said. Capizzi was 
recently appointed to his office by the Board of Supervisors and faces 
opposition in November from Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement signed Friday by Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein, both 
defendants admitted that they did not properly report the loans in financial 
disclosure statements during Patterson's campaign for the county supervisorial 
seat now held by Don R. Roth. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the only times the county district attorney's office has ever 
pursued civil sanctions against election-law violators where there was no 
evidence of criminal wrongdoing, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Chinn, who 
negotiated the settlement. The lawsuit charged that the defendants had 
"negligently or inadvertently" filed erroneous forms. 
</P>
<P>
"This probably signals that we will utilize the civil process where appropriate 
and not just leave that to the (state Fair Political Practices Commission)," 
Capizzi said in an interview. "This permits substantial fines in cases where it 
doesn't appear that criminal remedies are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Reed, an election-law expert who prepares campaign finance reports for 
several Southern California candidates and contributors, said that the 
settlement of $10,000 for each defendant was high and that the state usually 
charges about $2,000 for each reporting violation. 
</P>
<P>
Since two loans were involved in this case, Reed estimated the state would have 
imposed a fine of about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi responded, however, that "we thought this was an appropriate fine . . . 
(and) apparently all the parties agreed that this was an appropriate conclusion 
to this case." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint stemmed from Patterson's 1986 campaign for supervisor against 
Roth, then mayor of Anaheim, and Jim Beam, then mayor of Orange. Patterson, the 
only Democrat running for the nonpartisan office, finished third in the June 
primary, after which Roth won the seat in a runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
Roth and his 1986 campaign manager, Harvey Englander, said Patterson was a 
serious candidate in the race because he had represented much of the district 
in Congress before he was defeated in 1984 by Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove). 
</P>
<P>
The violation was first flagged in 1988 by state auditors doing a routine 
random audit of campaign statements. Both O'Neill and Patterson filed 
corrections to their statements after they were notified of the infractions by 
the auditors. 
</P>
<P>
County Democratic and Republican officials said Friday they did not believe 
Patterson had intentionally altered his finance report. They also said it was 
well-known that O'Neill, a wealthy Orange County developer, was strongly 
backing Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he did it on purpose," Englander said. "We just always assumed 
that Dick O'Neill was a guarantor or a source of those loans. That was common 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that Patterson is now a friend and supported him in his successful 
reelection earlier this month. He also said the close campaign in 1986 was 
raucous. 
</P>
<P>
"Even breathing was a campaign issue," he said. "Every day was a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana attorney John Hanna, former chairman of Orange County's Democratic 
Party, was surprised that Patterson and O'Neill had agreed to pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
Calling both "men of integrity," Hanna said: "I don't know exactly what 
transpired. It appears to me . . . what they did they did unintentionally, 
without intent of violating any law. And they were wrong. And they're paying 
the price for it. If I turn in my income tax return and I'm wrong, I've gotta 
pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like these guys are dirtbags," he added. "You go through 10 years of 
Congress, and (Patterson) doesn't have a blot on his record." 
</P>
<P>
As a brief description of the accusation -- and settlement -- was read to him, 
Hanna seemed sympathetic to O'Neill's and Patterson's plight, blaming it in 
large part on the complexity of laws governing political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Haskin, executive director of the Orange County Republican Party, also 
sympathized regarding the complexity of election laws. "Many of these campaign 
finance laws are very complicated and very technical in nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Often a person can try as hard as humanly possible to comply and still find 
themselves out of compliance," Haskin said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that "the amount of the fine is some kind of an indicator 
whether or not there was any intentional wrongdoing. And a $10,000 fine is 
fairly significant, especially if it were agreed to out of court." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hanna, a longtime Democratic activist as well as a former Patterson aide 
who worked in his congressional office from 1976-1980: "The only thing I can 
say is that it appears the problem was a reporting one and not the substance of 
the loan. It was fairly well-known . . . that O'Neill was a major supporter of 
Patterson's at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The implication one may have -- that they were trying to hide the fact that 
O'Neill was involved -- was hardly the case. O'Neill was encouraging him to 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Hanna said, "there was, during this time period, some uncertainty about 
the law -- what loan is personal, what loan is political. Apparently there was 
a violation here. That's why all parties wanted to settle." 
</P>
<P>
Hanna noted that he could still remember Patterson's race fairly well because 
"when Jerry ran, I told him not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hanna said, Patterson "was coming off a tough loss in '84," when 
he lost his congressional seat of 10 years to Dornan. Hanna said he had been 
hoping Patterson would save his energies for a bid to reclaim his congressional 
seat in 1988, but Patterson decided instead to make a run for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an expensive election," Hanna said. "I don't remember how much." 
</P>
<P>
Haskin noted that he didn't want to make any negative comment about Patterson. 
"The guy's been sort of out of politics for enough years. . . . I wouldn't want 
to kick the guy in the teeth." 
</P>
<P>
As for O'Neill, Haskin said, "it is a bit surprising that Richard O'Neill would 
get tangled up in a situation that would result in such a large fine. He's very 
experienced in political affairs. It's one of those things that somebody . . . 
should have known better."

It took nearly 5 1/2 years to convict David A. Brown in the death of his wife, 
Linda Marie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1985: Patti Bailey, at the request of her lover and brother-in-law, 
David A. Brown, takes a gun into the room of her sister, Linda Marie Brown 
(David's wife) at the Garden Grove home where they all live, intent on killing 
her. She gets scared and backs out. But, she now says, Brown told her it would 
be better anyway if Cinnamon, his daughter, did the shooting, since as a 
juvenile she probably wouldn't go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
March 19, 1985: Cinnamon Brown, 15, aided by her sister-in-law, Patti Bailey, 
fatally shoots her stepmother, Linda Marie Brown, as she sleeps in her bed. The 
police find Cinnamon in the back-yard doghouse, sick from a lethal drug 
concoction, with a crumpled suicide note saying she was sorry for shooting her 
stepmother. Her father, David A. Brown, had been out to a convenience store 
when the shooting occurred. Cinammon later said it was her father who suggested 
she take the drugs and "fake" a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1986: Cinnamon Brown is sentenced to 27 years to life for murder 
but, because she is a juvenile, is sent to the California Youth Authority, 
where she is scheduled to remain no later than age 25. 
</P>
<P>
1985-1988: Orange County district attorney investigator Jay Newell isn't 
satisfied that the truth came out at her trial. For the next three years he 
keeps track of David A. Brown's business affairs, follows what happens to the 
insurance money -- Brown collected $835,000 on his wife's death -- and monitors 
Cinnamon's activities at the Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1986: David A. Brown and Patti Bailey are secretly married. 
</P>
<P>
July 3, 1988: Cinnamon Brown turns 18. She is no longer a juvenile, and Newell 
feels free to contact her for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 10, 1988: Cinnamon Brown calls Newell and says she wants to tell him what 
happened. He soon interviews her. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 13, 1988: Cinammon is visited at a Youth Authority facility by her father, 
David, who tells her that if she tells the truth about what happened the night 
of the murder, "we'd all be in jail." He tells her he is sorry that she ended 
up going to prison. He then suggested that perhaps Patti would be willing to 
accept the blame and take Cinnamon's place in prison. Unknown to Brown, law 
enforcement authorities are covertly taping their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 22, 1988: Brown and Patti Bailey are arrested at their Anaheim home and 
charged with Linda Marie Brown's murder. Brown makes damaging admissions to 
police that he had been involved in early discussions with the two young women 
about Linda's death. But he claims they initiated it and he didn't take them 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
October, 1988: Patti Bailey admits she and Cinnamon had been involved in a 
plot, masterminded by David Brown, to kill Linda. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1989: Cinnamon and Patti testify against Brown at his preliminary 
hearing. He is ordered bound over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1989: Prosecutors discover through a jailhouse informant that Brown 
is plotting to kill his wife, Patti, as well as Jay Newell and Jeoffrey L. 
Robinson, the lead prosecutor. The police secretly record Brown and another 
inmate as they discuss details of the plot. Later, when the inmate is free and 
cooperating with authorities, he falsely tells Brown all three have been 
murdered. Brown, unaware the conversation was being taped, answered: "Wonderful 
. . . you did great." 
</P>
<P>
May 11, 1989: Patti Bailey pleads guilty and is sentenced to the California 
Youth Authority. Now 21, she will remain in custody until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
June 15, 1990: Brown is convicted of first-degree murder for financial gain and 
conspiracy.

CALTRANS DIRECTOR MCKEAN TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Keith E. McKean, the first full-fledged director of the California Department 
of Transportation office in Orange County, has announced that he will retire 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
McKean, 65, said he had always intended to retire this year but was waiting for 
passage of Proposition 111, the gasoline tax hike approved by California voters 
in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
McKean has headed the Orange County District since 1988, following Robert H. 
Ramey, who served on an interim basis while the district was being created in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been an important player in the development of our state highway 
system, particularly in Southern California," said Caltrans Director Robert K. 
Best. "His experience and knowledge will be difficult to replace." 
</P>
<P>
McKean said two of his favorite highway projects during his 40-year career were 
the Foothill and Century freeways in Los Angeles County, which he routed and 
managed, respectively.

But the most significant project "in the mill," he added, is the widening of 
the Santa Ana Freeway. McKean said the project has been one of his biggest 
challenges, in part because funding for widening the freeway north of the 
Garden Grove Freeway "is still a question mark." 
</P>
<P>
"There will have to be an infusion of local money into that project," McKean 
said, or widening that section won't begin for many years.

CLAIM IS DENIED IN ROCK FAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood City Council this week rejected a claim filed by the family of a 
Fountain Valley teen-ager who died in police custody outside a Grateful Dead 
concert at the Forum in December, setting up a lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
The claim alleged that Patrick Shanahan, 19, died because of excessive force by 
police officers who clubbed him, applied a chokehold and did not start 
emergency first aid when he stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police have maintained that officers did not use excessive force. 
Police said Shanahan was violent and under the influence of drugs when he was 
arrested outside the Forum on Dec. 10. Police took Shanahan to a nearby 
hospital after he stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the denial was routine for a claim that contained such 
difficult legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence B. Trygstad, the Shanahan attorney, said he would file a 
wrongful-death lawsuit on behalf of the family.

FEE DISTRICT OKD TO FUND INTERCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To raise more than $8 million of the city's share for constructing a Santa Ana 
Freeway interchange at Bake Parkway, the City Council recently approved a fee 
district that will charge developers in the yet-to-be-built portions of the 
Irvine Spectrum business complex. 
</P>
<P>
The private fee district was requested by the Irvine Co., the major landholder 
in the affected area of the Spectrum complex that is between Alton Parkway and 
Lake Forest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
According to a November, 1988, study ordered by city and county officials, the 
developer fees will raise $8.4 million toward the projected $15.5-million cost 
of the interchange. 
</P>
<P>
The other $6.7 million will come mostly from developer fees charged under the 
Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan. 
</P>
<P>
That plan was established by the county to help fund road construction in the 
unincorporated area encompassing the communities of Lake Forest, El Toro and 
Rancho Santa Margarita, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the fee district, the city of Irvine will not have to pay for 
building the interchange. Fees will be charged to landholders in the district 
when they apply for building permits at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The fees will vary depending on the location and size of the project. WENDY

BANK ROBBER FIRES SHOT, GRABS MONEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lone gunman made off with an undisclosed amount of cash Friday morning after 
firing a shot and robbing a Security Pacific National Bank, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunman entered the bank at 32201 Camino Capistrano about 
11:20 a.m., fired one round from a small-caliber pistol and leaped over the 
counter into the teller area. 
</P>
<P>
He grabbed handfuls of cash from two or three tellers, jumped back over the 
counter and fled, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just conducting my business at the teller's window when I heard the shot 
go off," said Leonard Barwick of Dana Point. "It sounded like a small gun, 
almost like a cap pistol. He then told all the customers to move back and he 
jumped over the counter and took the money." 
</P>
<P>
Another witness who asked not to be identified said the gunman was standing in 
line and then walked up to the counter and fired his gun. Several witnesses 
outside the bank said the man ran out of the bank and across Avenida 
Golondrina, through a neighboring shopping center and then behind the center to 
the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some confusion as to whether he left the area on foot or in a van," 
said Lt. Richard Olson of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as a white male in his 30s, of medium build and 
wearing a blue UCLA baseball cap, a Hawaiian shirt and blue pants. LEN HALL

TEAM EFFORT IS BANISHING SLUM LABEL

<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of apartments in a run-down Anaheim neighborhood are beginning to see 
the results of their combined efforts to put the place back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
The South Romneya Owners Assn., in an unlikely friendship with city code 
enforcement officials, has worked in recent months to bring living conditions 
in the crowded, tattered neighborhood up to standard. 
</P>
<P>
"This place has run the gamut of just about every violation of the substandard 
housing code," said Gary L. Moore, the city code enforcement officer for the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The area, nestled just south of Romneya Drive, is often called Citron-Hall 
because of the two main cross streets. 
</P>
<P>
The owners group was formed about a year ago when a new landlord, Jim Connell, 
came to the area and was concerned about the way the buildings were managed. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier landlords' group was dwindling in membership and activity, and soon 
he was named president of the new organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed at how lackadaisical some of these people are about managing 
their buildings," Connell said . "They'd get their buildings up to code and 
then just sit back for six months and think that everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
By chipping in $8 a month each, the owners group has raised funds for an 
on-site armed guard who is stationed there on weekend nights to ward off gang 
rumbles and thwart drug traffic. And landlords are in the process of using the 
$25 annual membership fee to hire two on-site managers to oversee the area and 
report residents' troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The area began changing from simply a poor neighborhood to a more violently 
troubled one when a neighborhood up the street received a complete overhaul a 
few years ago. Many of the poorer residents could not afford the accompanying 
higher rents there and simply crowded into the 58 nearby complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the apartment owners are absentee landlords, and the complexes are 
small enough that they are not required to have managers. Consequently, most 
owners had little idea of the deteriorating conditions, and simply left the 
residents to fend for themselves, Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the owners group boasts about 20 members, more than half of the 
approximately 50 landlords don't want to get involved, Connell explained. That 
makes cleaning up the area and keeping it safe all the more difficult, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disgusting because some of these landlords are just not interested. . . . 
They're the ones whose buildings are really the problems," Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's also where the the partnership with code enforcement comes in handy, 
according to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that he has more than a dozen pending criminal cases against 
landlords who have failed to resolve code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Both Moore and Connell plan to keep working their respective ends of the 
improvement plan while hoping that offending owners get the message that 
landlords must be responsible for their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the owners are realizing they need to do something," Connell said. 
"I'm bound and determined that this thing's going to work." LISA MASCARO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;

<P>
TANKER OWNER ASKS FOR LIMIT ON LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The company whose tanker was involved in the Feb. 7 oil spill is asking a U.S. 
District Court to limit its future liability for the disaster to $8 million, 
which will likely force Huntington Beach into a legal battle to recover 
potential costs for environmental damages, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading Transportation Co.'s petition, filed in U.S. Central District 
Court in Los Angeles, claims the company was not responsible for the spill and, 
therefore, should be exempt from paying any damages in addition to the $20 
million the firm says it has already spent in cleanup and emergency-response 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
But if the company is found to be at least partially at fault, the petition 
asks that its additional liability not exceed the $8-million value of the 
American Trader, the 800-foot oil tanker that dumped nearly 400,000 gallons of 
crude into the ocean off Huntington Beach. The vessel, hauling British 
Petroleum's oil, apparently punctured its hull on its own anchor while mooring 
1 1/2 miles off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The legal request was filed in response to a U.S. Coast Guard report last month 
that concluded that the Golden West Refinery Co., owner of the offshore 
platform where the tanker was heading, was partly to blame for the accident, 
said David Woolley, a Long Beach-based attorney representing American Trading. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Coast Guard hearing was very favorable to our client, we don't 
want cities and other government agencies suing us for megabucks," Woolley said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading has paid Huntington Beach $250,000 as a partial payment of 
$554,000 in claims by the city for response and cleanup costs and lost 
beach-parking revenues, city finance director Dan Villella said. The payment is 
part of the $20 million the company says it has spent so far in connection with 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three months, city officials have been working with state and 
federal agencies in hopes of billing the firm for extra costs beyond those 
directly related to the response to and cleanup of the spill. Those charges 
likely would include reparations for harm done to local wildlife, damage to the 
coastline and perceived tarnishing of the city's public image, Villella said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no price has yet been attached to such alleged damages, city officials 
have said the cost could total as much as tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gail C. Hutton said she perceives American Trading's petition as "a 
way of getting out of expensive damages" owed to the city. "What's the damage 
of not being able to see pelicans again in Bolsa Chica? And what about the loss 
of fish? Or days lost at the beach? These are all questions that need to be 
answered," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
To get those answers, the City Council on Monday will consider hiring a Long 
Beach-based legal consultant who specializes in admiralty and maritime law to 
further study the possibility of a suit against the owner of the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays said Friday he is determined to recoup costs for 
environmental damage, whether by negotiated settlement or court action. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that with these 'soft' costs we would run into some legal problems," 
Mays said. "But if we can justify these costs, and (American Trading) decides 
not to cooperate, then we'll have to go to litigation." JOHN PENNER

DEFUNCT SITE LEASED TO LUTHERAN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former site of Burke School, closed four years ago because of declining 
enrollment, is scheduled to open in September as a Christian high school. 
</P>
<P>
California Lutheran High School, which three years ago moved from one closed 
public school site in Tustin to another in Garden Grove, plans to relocate 
again into the former Burke site for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach City School District's trustees Tuesday agreed to lease 
the facility, near Atlanta Avenue and Bushard Street, to California Lutheran 
through June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Under the lease, which must be approved by the City Council, the private school 
would pay the district $60,000 rent for the first two years and $72,000 for the 
third year, in addition to maintaining the facility. The lease payment is lower 
during the first two years to offset the school's costs for improving the site, 
district Asst. Supt. Gary Burgner said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the third year, the school board could renew the lease, reopen 
the site as a district school or sell or lease the building to a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Since Burke was closed in 1986, half the facility has been leased as a 
child-care center for $36,000 a year, Burgner said. The other half has remained 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees president Sherry Barlow and Trustees Pat Cohen and Gary Nelson 
approved the lease, but Trustee Robert Mann abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said he is "not totally opposed" to the deal but is concerned that many of 
the high school's 60 students would be driving to school, potentially creating 
parking and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
One district teacher, former school board candidate Ed Zschoche, assailed the 
lease, calling it a violation of the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
"If Cal Lutheran wants a school, they ought to build it," he said. JOHN PENNER

MARGINS OF VICTORY WIDEN AFTER FINAL O.C. VOTE TALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The county registrar of voters' office Friday announced official vote totals 
from the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
The final count held no surprises, and margins widened in two of the county's 
closest races. 
</P>
<P>
In the contest for mayor of Irvine -- during which incumbent Larry Agran and 
challenger Sally Anne Sheridan swapped leads -- Sheridan wound up defeating 
Agran by 672 votes, rather than the 153 votes of the preliminary total. 
</P>
<P>
And in the Democratic primary in the 42nd Congressional District, which 
straddles Orange and Los Angeles counties, Huntington Beach resident Guy C. 
Kimbrough was 200 votes ahead of James Cavuto of Torrance after the final, 
unofficial Orange County tally. Just 14 votes had separated them in the 
preliminary count. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough defeated Cavuto by 910 votes in the official Orange County tally. In 
Los Angeles County, Cavuto beat Kimbrough by 710 votes in the original count, 
but the Los Angeles County registrar of voters will not complete its official 
count until June 26. 
</P>
<P>
If his victory is verified, Kimbrough, a political science teacher at Mt. San 
Jacinto College, will face Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) in the Nov. 6 
general election. In the 1988 general election match-up, Kimbrough lost to 
Rohrabacher, 64% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, registrar's clerk Ann Halford said the county vote totals 
will be certified Tuesday by the California secretary of state's office. 
Halford added that it took her office several days to complete the count 
because 10,000 to 15,000 absentee ballots had been submitted on Election Day.

SUMMERTIME, AND THE SWIMMING IS EASY . . . UNLESS IT'S FOR WATER POLO 
</P>

<P>
FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early Thursday morning -- the 5:45 a.m. type of early -- Sunny Hills High 
School water polo players were toe-testing the temperature of the pool at 
Independence Park of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 players, who were there by choice, play for the Trojan water polo club, 
which is Sunny Hills' summer team. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to two-hour morning workouts five days a week, the players also 
lift weights three times a week, play league games at night twice a week and 
participate in tournaments on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Kids all over the county are getting their feet wet the same way, and they are 
each paying from $50 to $300 for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Every successful water polo team is dependent on a strong summer 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer water polo is a tremendously important part of the school program," 
Sunny Hills Coach Keith Nighswonger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at basketball or any sport -- they go year-round as well. A kid that 
plays in the summertime can pick up a world of experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll play 55 to 60 games (over a six-week schedule). In a successful high 
school season, which includes playoffs, you play 25 to 30 games. You pick up 
almost two years' experience in the summer. You can't teach that." 
</P>
<P>
Work in the summer is geared toward winning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams that play in the summer are the ones that are the most successful 
(in the fall)," Villa Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the summer they learn to get tough," he said. "They learn the 
tricks that go on under water. They learn survival." 
</P>
<P>
A good example is El Toro, which lost most of the starters from its 1988 
Southern Section 3-A Division championship team. Thanks in part to their summer 
schedule, the Chargers won the title again in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro operates its summer program with a twist. The Charger varsity plays 
against community college teams and junior varsity squads from four-year 
universities. El Toro's JV team plays in varsity summer leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to play each squad a notch above what they're supposed to," El Toro 
Coach Don Stoll said. "It can be hard, and sometimes we lose players who don't 
like getting beat 15-4 in the summer. But around here, we like to say the boys 
of summer make the men of September." 
</P>
<P>
Still, summer water polo is not just hard work. Coaches, players, officials and 
parents say they love and enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe most of the people out there in the summertime have a general 
love for the sport," Nighswonger said. "I enjoy the people. It's almost kind of 
a social thing -- you get to see them (parents, coaches and referees) every 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
Nighswonger makes no apologies for getting the kids up early in the summer. 
"Most of the time I keep these kids busy," he said. "I find that the more you 
ask and expect, the more you get. In the summer you can measure what the 
commitment is going to be for the following season." 
</P>
<P>
Club play provides an opportunity for members of a high school team to play 
together in the summer. Though any player may play for any club, most join for 
the club led by their high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
Each player pays a participation fee, which includes a $25 registration fee to 
U.S. Water Polo for insurance and to help pay officials. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Water Polo, which selects the Olympic and National teams, divides the 
country into seven zones for governing purposes. Orange County is in Zone 7, 
where there are two districts -- Southern Pacific and Pacifica Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The county is in the Southern Pacific District, which stretches north to San 
Luis Obispo, east to Indio and south to San Clemente. It contains approximately 
3,500 athletes and 100 registered teams.

"U.S. Water Polo sanctions every tournament at all different age groups," said 
George Ratkovic, Zone 7 chairman. "U.S. Water Polo provides liability insurance 
for the club, accident insurance for the players and officials for the games. 
If a team or player plays outside U.S. Water Polo (in a nonsanctioned event), 
they are not covered." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Water Polo also puts on clinics for coaches and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Though most summer leagues are sanctioned by U.S. Water Polo, not all are. 
Leagues are generally organized by coaches, who establish the participation fee 
that goes toward pool rental and payment of officials. 
</P>
<P>
The leagues are competitive, but the goal is experience, not winning. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer is more low-key," Nighswonger said. "That's the nice thing about 
the summer -- that everyone out there is out there to improve their game. In 
the fall it's a much more competitive situation. There's a different tone." 
</P>
<P>
Tournaments, however, tend to bring out the competitive spirit in the summer. 
Up to 16 teams gather over the weekend for four or five games, and two 
officials are used. League games generally employ only one official. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to summer leagues, summer camps are being started for water polo 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Water Polo Academy at Villa Park High School will be the 
county's first camp. Its initial session runs next week, Monday through Friday, 
and its second session is scheduled June 25-29. Cost is $175 for the day camp, 
which is open to players between the ages of 12 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps water polo's most prestigious summer camp is at Stanford, where 
participants stay overnight in the dorms for $425 a week. Day campers pay $325. 
Pepperdine and Cal State Long Beach also have camps. 
</P>
<P>
Don Cholodenko, Capistrano Valley water polo coach, said college camps have 
helped his players. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Capistrano Valley "was the worst team in the county," 
Cholodenko said. After his second year at the school, he had about 12 players 
attend a camp at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
This past season, Capistrano Valley finished 27-2, losing to South Coast League 
rival El Toro in the 3-A final. 
</P>
<P>
But camps are generally designed for young players who need to work on 
improving their technique. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, your better players don't come to camps; it's usually the 
younger kids," Ehrlich said. "Your 17- to 18-year-olds are working during the 
day and then they play at night in leagues, so it can be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Cholodenko doubts the helpfulness of camp for an older player because "most of 
the stuff you hear at the camps -- they've heard it before. It becomes a 
question of how much you are going to pick up for the money you pay." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, money is not a major concern when it comes to water polo. Some 
schools have booster clubs that hold fund-raisers for trips to such places as 
Hawaii and Australia for games. Other schools leave money matters up to the 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
"(Dealing with water polo) financially -- that's minimal," said Shelley 
Woolery, whose son, Josh, was a senior on the Villa Park team this season. 
"It's mostly just buying a small piece of cloth (bathing suit). It's not like 
going out and buying new cleats every time they wear out." 
</P>
<P>
And the time commitment doesn't appear to be a problem for anyone -- even 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"(Summer water polo) takes up a lot of our time," Shelley Woolery said. "But 
it's better that than visiting your kid in jail." 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy the time," said Stoll, who has some concern about being consumed by 
the sport. "I told the kids yesterday that practice was going to be from 2:30 
to 4:30 and two kids raised their hands and asked, 'Can it go to five?' I said, 
'I'll be here.' "

His coach shouted technical advice. His parents, relatives and longtime pals 
added their encouragement. And the students from his Santa Fe Springs High 
School band class provided an orchestra of vocal support. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, only Doug Nordquist was going to get Doug Nordquist over the 
high jump bar Friday night at the USA/Mobil national track and field 
championships at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Nordquist managed that task quite nicely, leaping 7 feet 8 3/4 inches. Not only 
was that a career best -- he jumped 7-8 1/2 at the Irvine Elite Classic June 3 
-- but it also broke his meet record of 7-8 set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Nordquist, Hollis Conway, the American record-holder at 7-10, 
also cleared 7-8 3/4 Friday, then beat Nordquist in a jump-off moments later. 
In the jump-off, both missed at 7-9 1/2, but when the bar was lowered to 7-8 
3/4 again, Conway cleared it but Nordquist could not. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was disappointed that he did not win -- Nordquist wanted to add a 
third national championship to the two he earned in 1986 and '88 -- he did 
accomplish his ultimate goal: a berth on the U.S. Goodwill Games team. The top 
two finishers in each event qualify for the 50-nation meet, which will be held 
July 20-Aug. 5 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Nordquist, 31, and Conway, 22, mugged for reporters after the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for him. I already had two championships," said Nordquist, a La 
Habra resident who attended Sonora High School. 
</P>
<P>
Answered Conway: "Yeah, I'm the freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Nordquist, who won the gold medal at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, cleared 
his first five heights, including his career-best 7-8 3/4. So excited was 
Nordquist with that leap that he nearly ran out onto the track just as the 
men's 1,500-meter runners went by. 
</P>
<P>
Then, instead of attempting the next height, 7-9 1/2, Nordquist asked that the 
bar be raised to 7-10 1/2 -- an attempt to set the American record. But he 
missed twice, scraping the bar with his back, and came to the bleachers for 
some quick advice from his coach, Allan Hanckela. 
</P>
<P>
What Nordquist got was a tip from his father. 
</P>
<P>
"Think!" Neil Nordquist shouted to his son. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think!" his son shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he should have thought. Nordquist missed on the third attempt, forcing 
the jump-off for the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it too badly. I hadn't pressed all day long," Nordquist said. "I got 
a little excited. . . . It's just a new experience. There's a big difference 
between jumping 7-6 and 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to get used to that feeling. Come Goodwill Games, we'll see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>

Jim Doehring, a former San Clemente High standout now living in Fallbrook, won 
the shotput with a toss of 69-6 3/4. World record-holder Randy Barnes, who 
complained of an injured hand, was second at 69-3 1/2. . . . Former UC Irvine 
long jumper Mike Powell was first in that event's qualifying heat with a 
wind-aided leap of 26-10.5. . . . Costa Mesa resident Bonnie Dasse, formerly of 
Orange Coast College, was third in the shotput, qualifying at 56-10 3/4. . . . 
Former Newport Beach resident PattiSue Plumer won her heat of the 1,500 in 
4:12.54. In another 1,500 heat, UCI's Buffy Rabbitt was ninth (4:23.04) and did 
not qualify.

TACKLING THE ATTENDANCE PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
BIG WEST: WITH DIVISION I-A STATUS IN JEOPARDY, CONFERENCE ATHLETIC DIRECTORS 
WILL MEET TO DISCUSS WAYS TO UPGRADE FOOTBALL PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Big West Conference athletic directors will meet in Las Vegas Sunday and Monday 
to discuss ways conference schools can upgrade their football programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception of Big West football needs to be improved -- no question about 
it," said Dennis Farrell, associate conference commissioner. "No miracle cures 
are expected out of this meeting, but we're looking to do something to get the 
ball rolling in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
The conference's major concern, Farrell said, is with sagging attendance at 
member schools, a problem that has jeopardized the conference's Division I-A 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain I-A status, five of the conference's eight teams must have averaged 
either 20,000 fans for all games or 17,000 fans for home games once in the 
previous four seasons. Individual schools can qualify for Division 1-A status 
by fulfilling the same criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been on the bubble a couple of times," Farrell said. "We want all of our 
schools to qualify for 1-A membership instead of making it by the skin of our 
teeth every year." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said the first step in improving attendance could be to cut the number 
of conference games required of each school. Presently, teams play a full 
round-robin schedule in which each school plays seven conference opponents a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said if there is one visible decision made during this weekend's 
meetings, it will be to reduce the number of conference games so that schools 
can schedule more attractive nonconference opponents, either big-name schools 
or teams that are natural rivals, and possibly increase attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at requiring from three conference games a year up to the 
current seven," Farrell said. "There's no consensus on the number of games, but 
there's a big push (among athletic directors) to reduce the requirement." 
</P>
<P>
There has also been talk of the conference attempting to gain admittance to the 
College Football Assn., a consortium of 64 of the nation's major college 
football-playing universities whose primary purpose is to negotiate television 
contracts for its member schools. 
</P>
<P>
But that's pretty much a pipe dream for now. Only one conference school, Fresno 
State, even comes close to meeting CFA membership criteria, which includes 
averaging 20,000 in paid attendance for three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Cal State Fullerton averaged 3,766 spectators for four home games 
and 14,375 for seven road games. The Titans and Long Beach State have had the 
lowest attendance figures in the conference in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
At least five schools would have to meet CFA criteria for the entire conference 
to gain admittance. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevailing mood now is we don't know what the future of the CFA is, let 
alone where we fit into it," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's recent decision to secede from the CFA and negotiate its own TV 
contract with NBC, talk of the Southeastern Conference expanding and wanting to 
negotiate its own TV deals, and talk of the Southwest Conference and Big Eight 
possibly merging for TV purposes has put the CFA's future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the CFA five years from now will be a viable entity," Farrell 
said. "And because of that, I'm not sure our schools are so interested in doing 
whatever it takes to get CFA membership." 
</P>
<P>
A more realistic possibility is conference expansion -- San Diego State, a CFA 
member, and Cal State Northridge have expressed interest in joining the Big 
West -- or a conference realignment that would benefit the Big West in terms of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be a geography expert to look at a map and realize some 
schools could cut costs by realigning," Cal State Fullerton Athletic Director 
Ed Carroll said. "I think the Big West is more appealing than it used to be 
because it wants to upgrade football."

IRELAND APPROVES ICN'S RIBAVIRIN FOR TREATING HIV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced Friday that the Irish government has 
approved the sale of the firm's controversial drug ribavirin to people infected 
with the virus that causes AIDS, marking the first time that any nation has 
done so. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based pharmaceutical company said the Republic of Ireland will 
allow the sale of ribavirin to treat people infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. People suffering from such HIV 
symptoms as fevers, night sweats and fatigue would be eligible to receive the 
antiviral drug. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates that 140 people have contracted full 
cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Ireland and that nearly 1,000 
people are infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has refused to approve ribavirin to treat 
HIV-infected patients and has denied ICN's request to distribute the drug 
pending approval. The drug, which has been widely marketed by ICN as a cure for 
several maladies, is viewed with skepticism in some scientific circles as a 
treatment for AIDS-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
ICN announced in March that it had given up trying to win FDA approval for 
ribavirin to treat HIV patients, even though the company considers the drug 
effective for that purpose. Ribavirin's only FDA-approved use is to treat 
severe lower respiratory tract infections in young children. 
</P>
<P>
ICN spokesman Jack Sholl said the company has no plans "at the present time" to 
reverse its position and seek FDA approval. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Jones, Ireland's vice-consulate in San Francisco, said her country's 
minister of health has granted ICN a limited license to sell ribavirin, which 
means that it will be available to doctors with expertise in AIDS treatment but 
not to general practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not promoting the drug," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Irish doctors generally advocate "early intervention strategies. . . . 
They have not received an unrestricted license. You can't walk into your 
pharmacy and get it willy-nilly." 
</P>
<P>
Sholl said he anticipates that several more countries will follow Ireland's 
lead. The company has asked Canada and Spain, among others, to review ribavirin 
to treat HIV. 
</P>
<P>
ICN's stock has shot up 76% since June 7. It closed Friday at $4.625 per share, 
up 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock has traded on rumors and speculation for years on whether this drug 
will ever be approved for an AIDS use," said Ken Bohringer, analyst with the 
New York brokerage of Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said ribavirin must still pass many clinical trials before 
it gains greater acceptance in treating HIV. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a first step, but I wouldn't get wildly enthusiastic," Bohringer said. 
</P>
<P>
Viren Mehta, a researcher with the New York-based pharmaceutical research firm 
Mehta &amp; Isaly, said, "I don't think many convincing clinical trials have 
been done to show various health officials in major markets of its real 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Ireland based its approval on two controversial studies conducted in 1986. The 
first study showed that 10 of 56 people infected with HIV and given placebos 
advanced to full cases of AIDS within 24 weeks, while just six of 107 HIV 
carriers treated with ribavirin became seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
But the methodology was blasted by scientists, including some at the FDA, who 
called the results meaningless because researchers had not determined that 
participating AIDS patients were at the same stage of disease. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Heseltine, associate chairman of medicine at USC, was one of the 
investigators in the 1986 studies. He said he now thinks that ribavirin could 
help to delay the onset of AIDS but that new studies are needed to see how it 
compares to the more widely accepted anti-AIDS drug, azidothymidine (AZT).

2 ORGANIZATIONS UNDECIDED OVER NEA AWARDS 
</P>

<P>
Pacific Chorale has been awarded an $11,500 grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts, but chorale officials were unavailable Friday to comment on 
whether they would accept the grant in light of a controversial anti-obscenity 
pledge required by groups receiving 1990 NEA funds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Opera Pacific officials have postponed until Aug. 16 a decision on 
whether to accept an $18,000 NEA grant. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was to have been made at a Thursday board meeting, but other 
issues took precedence on a crowded agenda, company general director David 
DiChiera said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
An NEA spokeswoman said the delay would not jeopardize the Costa Mesa-based 
opera troupe's grant, since recipients have several months to decide whether to 
accept the funds. 
</P>
<P>
The embattled NEA, under fire for subsidizing a handful of allegedly obscene or 
sacrilegious artworks, is requiring all 1990 grant recipients to sign a form 
pledging that they will not produce artworks that could be judged obscene and 
that fail to meet undefined standards of artistic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
In protest to the requirement, several artists or arts organizations across the 
country have rejected their grants or taken further action. Los Angeles 
choreographer Bella Lewitzky said Thursday that she will reject a $72,000 NEA 
grant and file suit against the federal arts agency over the anti-obscenity 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
All other Orange County arts organizations notified of 1990 NEA grants have 
said they will accept the funds. Officials at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
however, have said they will protest the anti-obscenity pledge either by 
striking it from grant acceptance forms or by attaching a letter to the forms 
noting their non-compliance with the pledge.

FOUR THEATER TROUPES RATED FOR STATE GRANTS;

Four county theater troupes are likely to receive state grants, based on 
ratings given this week in Sacramento by a California Arts Council grants 
advisory panel. Two of the groups' ratings dropped from previous years, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, recommending groups for 1990-91 support grants, measured 
organizational as well as artistic competence on a four-point scale. Though the 
size of the individual grants cannot be determined until the council's budget 
is set this summer, groups rated 3- and above have been funded in the past, 
council officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Council spokeswoman Joanne Anglin said Friday that the panel gave 3+ ratings to 
the Laguna Playhouse and the Orange County Black Actors Theatre, the same score 
both troupes received when they last applied for grants two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Civic Light Opera was given a 3- score, half a point lower than 
the 3 rating it received when it last applied in 1985. Also taking a half-point 
drop was the Grove Theatre Company, given a 3 after receiving a 3+ last year. 
</P>
<P>
No council officials involved with the week's rating process were immediately 
available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory had not been given a rating by press time. 
</P>
<P>
The council will vote in August on the panel's recommendations.

A new multicultural theater troupe called Cucucuevez is being formed in Orange 
County and will present the world premiere of Garden Grove playwright Roy 
Conboy's comedy, "Buscando America," as its first production in August. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Conboy, who will be the artistic director, said Friday that the 
troupe "will be established for the long term" by a group of about 15 writers, 
directors and performers representing "Latinos, Anglos and Asians." 
</P>
<P>
The first production -- described as "a comedy about the adventures of the 
ancient Toltec god Quetzalcoatl in modern-day Los Angeles" -- will be staged at 
Rancho Santiago College's Little Theatre West in Santa Ana for two weeks, 
beginning Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have a permanent home for a while," said Conboy, a former general 
manager and casting director of the Grove Shakespeare Festival. "Among 
ourselves, we think of what we're doing as 'art on the run.' " 
</P>
<P>
The troupe, an outgrowth of the college's New Plays and Players Workshop, will 
receive logistics support from Rancho Santiago's theater department but will 
have to raise $5,000 on its own to pay for staging "Buscando America." 
</P>
<P>
"We took the name Cucucuevez (koo-koo-KWE-ves) from the name of a homeless 
child who was found abandoned on the street by a man on his way home from 
work," Conboy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be identified with the values that gave that child a home and 
allowed her to live and prosper," he added. "Her story also poses the question 
of how we balance the values that our culture handed down to us with the 
necessities of modern existence." 
</P>
<P>
Conboy's play has received staged readings at South Coast Repertory in the 
Hispanic Playwrights Project and at other workshops in Seattle and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Cruz Gonzalez, the director of the Hispanic Playwrights Project, will also 
be a founding member of the new troupe, Conboy said. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes from "As Is," which played the Forum Theatre in Laguna Beach last winter 
and subsequently transferred to the Comedy Store Playhouse in Los Angeles, will 
be featured on "Entertainment This Week" at 6 p.m. Sunday on KNBC-Channel 4 as 
part of a segment about one of its actors. 
</P>
<P>
David Napier, who played a role in William Hoffman's bittersweet play about 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is the focus of the segment. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Wong, who produced the segment, said it talks about how Napier copes with 
the disease in real life and how he feels playing someone with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Five actors who have previously appeared at the Grove Shakespeare Festival will 
co-star with actress Kelly McGillis in a benefit performance at the Festival 
Amphitheatre to help match a $50,000 Irvine Foundation challenge grant, it was 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis, who was recently appointed to the classical theater's board of 
trustees, will be joined in "A Midsummer Night's Eve at the Grove" on July 30 
by Gregory Itzin, John-Frederick Jones, Daniel Bryan Cartmell, Carl Reggiardo 
and Kamella Tate. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, assembled by the Grove's producing artistic director, Thomas F. 
Bradac, will give readings and perform scenes from a handful of Shakespeare's 
plays, including "The Taming of the Shrew," "Romeo and Juliet," "Henry V" and 
"Julius Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old theater company also hopes to raise money with a 
pre-performance dinner to be attended by the cast and with a gallery exhibit of 
paintings by artist Jean Pol d. Franqueuil in the Village Green Courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
For information and reservations: (714) 636-7213.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: GRISLY KILLING SPICES NEW TALE OF BOOKMAKER-SLEUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Los Angeles sports bookmaker Jimmy Lujack had seen his partner's 
"gorgeous, precocious, outrageously self-possessed" niece was when he picked up 
the 17-year-old model at the Betty Ford Center, where she had spent 31 days 
trying to kick a drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
The next time Lujack would see the sassy Chinese-American teen-ager, she would 
be the decapitated victim of a gruesome ritualistic killing. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of Ginger Louis launches "The Book of Numbers" (Pocket Books), the 
second in a series of Los Angeles-based paperback mysteries written by Laguna 
Beach writer David Thoreau. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Lujack is not your ordinary private eye. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he's not really a private eye. He's a former LAPD vice cop-turned 
bookie who, as Thoreau says, occasionally acts as an investigative "consultant" 
for friends and others who seek his help. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I did that is so he can work both sides of the street. He works 
closely with the cops and he's also a bookie, so he's got entree with the bad 
guys," said Thoreau, 42, who spent "a lot of time with a couple of bookies in 
the Cerritos area" in creating his character. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of anybody making a bookie a hero," said Thoreau, adding with 
a laugh: "Sports betting is kind of a sign of the times: Everybody does it." 
</P>
<P>
Lujack is the kind of guy who, in "The Book of Numbers," says: "I believe in 
the truth. . . . That's why I'm a bookie. The point spread never lies." 
</P>
<P>
"He sees the world in a way I think is unique," Thoreau said, "and his morality 
is that he's a crook, but he's a good crook. He's cynical, but he's got heart. 
He's honest, but his business is illegal. He has a lot of contradictions, which 
I think makes him more lifelike." 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau's first Lujack mystery, "The Good Book," in 1988, sets the stage for 
"The Book of Numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau summarizes: Lujack's wife runs off with his LAPD partner and the pair 
become involved in a complicated sports betting scheme. The partner kills 
himself, and Lujack's wife checks into a mental institution. Lujack, meanwhile, 
has gotten mixed up in a "horrible homicide" and after beating up one of the 
witnesses, he is thrown off the police force. 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau's first hard-boiled Lujack outing was described in Mystery News as "a 
page-turner all the way . . . extremely entertaining." In describing his latest 
effort, a review in the New York Times said: "Mr. Thoreau writes so fast and 
furiously you'd think he had toothpicks underneath his fingernails . . . no one 
can accuse the author of lacking imagination in the action department." 
</P>
<P>
A 1970 graduate of UCLA, where he majored in English, Thoreau had been writing 
about five years when Arbor House published his first book, "The City at Bay," 
a 1979 hardcover mystery thriller about a police strike in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Thoreau was living in San Francisco where he worked nights as a 
waiter and wrote during the day. When the American Booksellers Assn. held its 
annual convention there in 1978, Thoreau took his half-completed manuscript of 
"The City at Bay" to the convention and showed it to an editor of a paperback 
publishing house. The editor put him in touch with an agent, who then sold the 
book to Arbor House. 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau said: "It's a strange way of getting a book published, but I didn't 
know anything about the business." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago he started writing for television, selling the first of eight 
scripts to "Highway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend -- this is the only way to get into television -- who was the 
story editor," explained Thoreau, who has since written for "Miami Vice," 
"Quantum Leap" and other TV series. In April, a movie based on his first 
screenplay, "Side Out," a story about beach volleyball, was released in 
theaters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Thoreau said he already has a third Lujack mystery planned out and he's 
currently in negotiations to sell the mystery series to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd be great for movies or television. There's a million stories you could 
tell about him," said Thoreau, who, yes, is indeed a relative of that more 
famous Thoreau, Henry David. 
</P>
<P>
"We're distant cousins," he said, chuckling, "but I don't write anything like 
him. 'The Book of Numbers' is not 'Walden's Pond.' " 
</P>
<P>
Author Honored: Orange County author Larry L. Meyer's "My Summer with Molly: 
The Journal of a Second Generation Father" received the 1990 Benjamin Franklin 
Award for autobiography at a recent ceremony held by the Publishers Marketing 
Assn. in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, a professor of journalism at Cal State Long Bech, lives in Huntington 
Beach. He will sign copies of his book from noon to 2 p.m. Sunday at Brentano's 
in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
More Honors: "Sections of Orange," the official Orange County centennial 
history written by Doris Walker of Dana Point, has been named "Best Historical 
Book of the Year" by the National Federation of Press Women.

FACES . . . : MILLER FINDS HE'S EQUAL TO 'JUSTICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Barry Miller had been reluctant to do a TV series. His film and stage careers 
were humming along just fine. He won a Tony Award a few seasons back for Neil 
Simon's "Biloxi Blues" and had recently worked with such heavyweight film 
directors as Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
But an old friend, producer/director Thomas Carter, made Miller an offer he 
couldn't refuse: the role of brilliant but cynical prosecutor Peter Brigman on 
Carter's new dramatic TV series, "Equal Justice," which airs Wednesdays at 10 
p.m. on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"The character Thomas wanted me to play had such moments of charm and moments 
of vileness at the same time," Miller says. "I thought it would be 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his initial reluctance, Miller admits now that it was a good career 
move to do "Equal Justice," which follows the lives and careers of public 
prosecutors. "The (number of) people who watch one episode is more than the 
audience was for all of my movies during the past 16 years," he says. "I was 
not resistant to the idea of getting that kind of exposure. It was a wise and 
good thing for me to do." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who also appeared in "Saturday Night Fever" and "Fame," has been 
working almost nonstop since receiving the Tony four years ago for his role as 
the embittered Jewish private in "Biloxi Blues." Winning the award, he says, 
changed his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Francis Coppola saw me in the show and asked me to be in 'Peggy Sue Got 
Married,' " he says. He then also did the short-lived David Rabe play "Goose 
and Tom-Tom" with Sean Penn, Madonna and Harvey Keitel. 
</P>
<P>
"Harvey introduced me to Martin Scorsese and that's how I got 'The Last 
Temptation of Christ.' " He spent a month on location in Morocco on the 
Scorsese epic, in which he played a young monk who urges Jesus to preach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were actually back seven centuries there," Miller recalls. "It was amazing 
to be thrust into a world like that. I would describe it as hallucinogenic. It 
was strange being that far away from home. I had never been that far away from 
home and I have never been that far away since." SUSAN KING

FACES . . . : ANOTHER DIMENSION FOR MARILYN MCCOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, Marilyn McCoo is still married to Billy Davis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that funny? Still, people wonder," the singer says of her 20-year 
marriage, which remains strong despite a professional split-up. "Ever since I 
hosted 'Solid Gold,' Billy and I have been trying to convince people we're 
still married." 
</P>
<P>
McCoo is probably best remembered as one fifth of the pop group the Fifth 
Dimension -- or half of Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., whose "You Don't 
Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)" remains a '70s classic. Since then, 
though, McCoo has been the star of quite a few shows -- as host of "Solid Gold" 
in the mid-'80s and headlining in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe. Most recently, 
McCoo made her theatrical debut as Aldonza in "Man of La Mancha" at the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
McCoo, who plays opposite Ken Howard, says being in a musical is a lot 
different than doing a Vegas show. "I'm used to being the one in charge," she 
explains. "Here, it's a matter of giving up control. I have no control over 
whether the whole play succeeds." But, she adds, "One can't forget that one is 
not totally in control all of the time." 
</P>
<P>
"Being in a play makes you more sensitive to the input of the people around 
you," McCoo continues. "To derive maximum value from them, you have to make 
sure not to get in their way" -- a lesson she will use after the play closes 
June 24, when she goes back to her solo act. 
</P>
<P>
McCoo's decision to work without her husband was a mutual decision, she says. 
"Performing with a group was very fulfilling in many ways, but I didn't want to 
look back on my life and say, 'Yeah, I had fun doing this, but I wish I had 
done that.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for Davis, he is currently working on some songs of his own. "If there is an 
album, we will have a duet," McCoo says. "We promised each other that if we 
worked separately, we'd always have guest performances on each other's albums."

<P>
Miriam Makeba coughed, and someone immediately asked if the cause was Soweto 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled at this reference to her hometown's distinctively grimy air. That 
was one memory, she explained, that she didn't have to bring with her during 31 
itinerant years of exile. 
</P>
<P>
"No, there's smog all over the world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's greatest musical export came home last week. Behind her were 31 
years that included the start of a great international singing career and more 
than one person's share of setbacks and affronts. 
</P>
<P>
The initial setback came during a four-week trip to the United States in 1960 
when, reporting to the South African Consulate in Chicago to renew her 
passport, she saw the consul stamp her passport "Invalid," certifying that she 
was forbidden to re-enter her country. 
</P>
<P>
That act, which turned a four-week trip into a 31-year ordeal, imprisoned her 
as if a cell door had slammed, exiling quintessentially African artist from her 
African homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Makeba's voice was perfectly suited to the sophisticated rhythms and 
chantsongs of African music, combining the clarity of a Joan Baez with the 
timing and throaty authority of a Sarah Vaughan. Her discovery in 1958, at the 
age of 26, when she joined a tour of a musical called "King Kong" seemed 
preordained. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a politician, I am a singer," she said Friday at her first press 
conference since re-entering South Africa. But from that moment in Chicago, she 
could not separate herself from politics, the curse of the South African 
artist. In 1963 she testified before the United Nations, and the South African 
government banned the sale of her records. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968 she married the black American radical Stokely Carmichael. They visited 
Cuba. American bookings evaporated, and recording contracts were canceled. She 
lived in Guinea for a while, the guest of former President Sekou Toure. 
Eventually, she settled in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come home to make sure that I could come home," the 58-year-old 
singer said, as if testing the trustworthiness of the South African government. 
"I said to the children that we will go together when it's for a long time, 
when they can see all the relatives and places in the country." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some cosmetic changes -- I see we're all sitting here together 
without the police coming," she said to an audience of a couple of hundred 
journalists and onlookers from the stage of Johannesburg's Market Theatre. 
"That is something. But I believe that the fundamental things are still intact. 
Apartheid is still alive. I can go home but I cannot vote, the Land Act is 
still intact, the Bantu Education Act is still intact. There's very little 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to my mother's grave, I knelt down and tried to make a prayer. 
That was the most painful thing that could have happened -- because I loved my 
mother. I would have liked to see her body. I was denied that. I felt: 'Why, 
why did this happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
One thing she did discover was a peculiarly South African impulse to put her to 
work as a symbol. The buzz of questions about her "program" -- whether and when 
she would perform, where she would make public appearances -- interfered with 
what she viewed as a largely personal errand. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sell records," she said. "I don't get gold records. I'm not on the hit 
parade. Long ago they said, 'That one, she sings politics.' I don't sing 
politics; I merely sing the truth."
