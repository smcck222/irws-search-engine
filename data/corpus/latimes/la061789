RAY MCANALLY, 63; IRISH ACTOR RELISHED ANONYMITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ray McAnally, the classically trained Irish character actor who portrayed a 
cardinal caught in a vise of conscience in the critically acclaimed 1986 film 
"The Mission," has died at his home in Ireland, it was learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dublin police said he died Thursday night, but gave no cause to either the 
Reuters news agency or Associated Press. Irish newspapers said the 63-year-old 
veteran of 250 plays, 50 films and more than 200 television appearances had 
undergone a heart bypass operation several years ago, and collapsed at his 
cottage in County Wicklow shortly after voting in Thursday's general election. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, seen most recently in this country as Harry Perkins, the shrewd but 
honest prime minister in "A Very British Coup" on PBS television, suffered from 
the perfection of his craft. 
</P>
<P>
He was considered an actor so successful at immersing himself in a role that he 
lacked the public identity common to less experienced stars. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Vanessa Redgrave reiterated that judgment after his death, saying in a 
statement Friday that "he sank himself into the character he was playing. 
Because of that, he played whatever character it was with tremendous belief and 
conviction and extraordinary detail." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally gloried in the anonymity, he told The Times in January. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe at a certain point somebody will say, 'Wait a minute, isn't that the 
chap who played that other role, the cardinal or whatever it was?' But even 
then, perhaps they're not quite sure. . . . I like not bringing a lot of 
baggage to a new part. I prefer being the enigma." 
</P>
<P>
Born in a seaside village in County Donegal, he studied for the priesthood 
before turning to acting and becoming a familiar figure at Dublin's legendary 
Abbey Theater. When in his 50s, he began to gain a wider audience through 
motion pictures and television. 
</P>
<P>
He was the cultured Cardinal Altimirano in "The Mission," about Christian 
missionaries in 18th-Century South America; the hard-edged Protestant work boss 
in the movie "Cal," about Northern Ireland's ongoing conflict, and the 
dissolute Englishman Rick Pym in the TV serialization of John le Carre's "A 
Perfect Spy." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 he won the Evening Standard Film Award for best actor in both "The 
Mission," in which he stares imponderably into the camera as the film fades to 
black, and "No Surrender," a dark comedy about elderly, feuding Northern Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Both "A Very British Coup" and 'A Perfect Spy" were seen last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he brought George Bernard Shaw to life on the London stage, playing 
the playwright opposite Sir John Gielgud in "The Best of Friends." 
</P>
<P>
He recently filmed "Venus Peter," about a 1950s Scottish village, and a 
television serialization of Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally made his stage debut at 18, acted in numerous Shakespearean parts, and 
played more than 150 roles at the Abbey from 1947 to 1963. He also spent time 
with the Royal Shakespeare Company in London. 
</P>
<P>
Entering movies in 1938, he played supporting roles in "Billy Budd" and "Shake 
Hands With the Devil," but only with "The Mission" did he begin to make his 
name internationally. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Carrickford, president of the Irish actors' union, called him "one of 
the finest character actors Ireland has ever produced." 
</P>
<P>
He had just returned from Canada where he had been filming with Robert De Niro 
and Sean Penn in a remake of the 1954 Humphrey Bogart movie "We're No Angels." 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by two sons and two daughters who were with him when died.

WOMAN WHO RUNS THE RAILROAD IS LIVING HER DREAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a tot, Carmen S. Chappell would lie in bed feigning sleep, awaiting the 
nightly shrieks and rumblings that shook her parents' California bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
Then she'd creep out of bed and climb through the window to meet the 
steam-engine trains that screeched to a halt nightly at the Trona Railway 
interchange, near China Lake, where her father worked as road master. 
</P>
<P>
Decades later, Chappell, one of 13 children, still recalls the faces and drawls 
of soot-smudged train engineers who gravely tipped their hats, admonished her 
about schoolwork and doled out candy and chewing gum to a little girl up way 
past her bedtime, breathless in the dark of the Mojave Desert but shivering 
with pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember their names. I'd be standing there waiting just so excited I 
thought I would burst," Chappell says, savoring the memories of a childhood 
love that led to her present job: president of the Ventura County Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company operates one of the nation's 346 short-line railroads -- a 
burgeoning branch of the railroad industry that runs on tracks of 100 miles or 
less -- and Chappell is one of the very few women at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a very competent and knowledgeable railroader," says Thomas C. Dorsey, 
vice president and general counsel of the American Short Line Railroad Assn., a 
trade group based in Washington. "No question about that, Carmen is very active 
and helpful in our group and enthusiastic about diving into issues." 
</P>
<P>
And though its trains don't travel faster than 10 m.p.h., the Ventura County 
Railway is on the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Business has tripled in the past four years, Chappell says, stoked by expansion 
of the Port of Hueneme and a growing industrial base in Oxnard. Each day, the 
little blue-and-yellow engines of the Ventura County Railway swing by the port, 
delivering a cargo that might include refrigerated citrus grown in Camarillo 
and picking up goods such as BMWs from Germany and Jaguars from England. The 
railway handles freight, not passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our railroad is only 13 miles long, but we're just as wide as the rest of 
them," says Martin V. Smith, an Oxnard-based businessman who bought the 
78-year-old railway in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says that in addition to running the railway, Chappell calls on potential 
customers such as Mercedes-Benz, trying to drum up business and woo shippers 
away from truck lines. The railway has about 50 customers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promoted in 1986 
</P>
<P>
"She came to us in our traffic and tariff department in 1981 and just kind of 
took charge," says Smith, who promoted Chappell from traffic manager to 
president in 1986. "She's a capable, qualified gal." 
</P>
<P>
Chappell, whose given name was Rosemarie Carmen Sarinana Orozco La Fuente de 
Perez (her parents were Spanish immigrants from Toledo and Madrid) is married 
to Robert Harris, an Amtrak conductor. She has two grown children from an 
earlier marriage. Between them, the couple have eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Like many in the industry, she says the ties that bind her to the railroad are 
deep -- railroading is in her blood. For Chappell, there's nothing as evocative 
as a distant train whistle. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes, there's such a romance in trains that will never die. I do love the 
railroad," she says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Railway has three locomotives with 900-horsepower, turbo 
engines that run on diesel fuel; 187 boxcars, one caboose and 14 employees. 
Headquarters is a railroad yard in downtown Oxnard, on 5th Street across from 
the Oxnard "Jesus Saves" Rescue Mission. Around the tracks hover a motley 
collection of Thunderbird-chugging railroad bums. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dead-End Ride 
</P>
<P>
Chappell says that from time to time, the hobos unwittingly hop onto her 
railroad thinking they'll get a free ride to Los Angeles or San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, "They end up at the Navy base, where they get arrested and taken off," 
Chappell says. "I do feel sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
The cars travel down two tracks: one that runs along the beach to the Port of 
Hueneme, another that goes through central and south Oxnard, past the 
industrial parks and old manufacturing warehouses that butt up against the 
track, and finally to the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center. 
</P>
<P>
Clients include Smuckers, General Electric, Occidental Chemical Co. and 
Willamette Industries. The railway hauls everything from plastics to sand, 
lumber, refrigerated produce and autos. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Oxnard, the railroad hooks up with the Southern Pacific. From 
there, cargo is shipped throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
One of the fringe benefits of working on a picturesque and historic railroad is 
that movie crews clamor to film there. Chappell says she accommodates requests 
so long as they don't interfere with the real train work. In recent years, 
Madonna shot scenes from "Who's That Girl" and Robert Stack shot segments of 
"Unsolved Mysteries." Tony Danza's "She's Out of Control," also includes shots 
filmed at the Ventura Railway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Carried Passengers 
</P>
<P>
The railway dates to 1911. Smith says it originally was built to service an 
Oxnard factory that extracted sugar from sugar beets. Back then, it also 
included passenger cars that took Ventura County residents for a day at the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Smith bought both businesses in 1958, and although the sugar factory is long 
gone, the railway remains and flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
Short-line railways saw a burst of expansion after 1980, when the Staggers Rail 
Act deregulated railroads, making it easier for the majors to sell off 
unprofitable or marginal lines. Since then, more than 200 new short-line 
railroads have been created. 
</P>
<P>
While many -- such as the Ventura Railway -- do little more than feed freight 
into national trunk lines of bigger systems such as the Southern Pacific or 
Burlington Northern, their profits come from lower operating costs and greater 
flexibility in fitting the needs and schedules of shippers. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell's Montalvo home is crammed with railroad memorabilia such as rail ties 
stamped with pre-World War II dates, antique railroad models, boxcar seals and 
relay switches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lost Without It' 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lost without it; I don't know any other life," Chappell says. "I was 
raised in the middle of a desert and that railroad was my playground. All my 
games, all my activities as a child were playing around the railroad ties and 
smelling the newness of the tar that they used to coat the ties," Chappell 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Using the railroad yard as their personal playground -- the closest town was 
Ridgecrest, 17 miles away -- Chappell and her 12 brothers and sisters would 
clamber up onto the locomotives and race over the railroad ties. 
</P>
<P>
The family lived by the tracks near a water tank where the steam engines 
stopped, and on hot summer evenings the children practically lived on their 
long front porch, where they watched the trains come and go a mere 20 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell graduated from high school at 15 and went to work for the Trona 
Railroad after her father, Jose Orozco, died in 1964. There she remained for 14 
years, handling shipments and accounts, earning promotions to assistant freight 
agent and ultimately, traffic manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Bowling Trip 
</P>
<P>
She applied to the Ventura Railway on a fluke in 1981, while passing through 
town on her way to a bowling convention in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When Smith called her bluff and hired her, she reluctantly left Trona. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Chappell says, she struggled with some male chauvinist, Casey Jones 
types who didn't want to acknowledge that a woman could run a railroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go to conventions and we'd have question-and-answer periods and I'd raise 
my hand but I was always overlooked," she recalls. Today, however, Chappell is 
secretary of the Pacific branch of the American Short Line Railroad Assn., and 
other railroaders often turn to her for information, she says. 
</P>
<P>
She works about 60 hours a week, spending as much time inside the office 
mapping out train schedules as outside in the yard, supervising details such as 
installation of a rubberized railroad crossing or replacing the line's 50-pound 
rails with 90-pound ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I'd be working here," Chappell says. "I always told people I 
was raised at one end of the Trona Railway and I'm going to die at the other. I 
never thought I'd achieve this."

It didn't quite pack the suspense of a countdown at Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
"Three, two, one . . ." a reporter intoned. 
</P>
<P>
And then, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter pulled the lever on a 
toilet that was stationed outside the Department of Water and Power building 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As the machine flushed its water out through a specially attached hose Friday, 
conscientious radio and television reporters gallantly thrust their microphones 
inside the white ceramic bowl to illustrate its relatively quiet thrust. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful exhibition was staged to unveil an ultralow-flush toilet, which 
swallows just 1.6 gallons of water at a time, about half of what a standard 
toilet uses. A city ordinance mandates that, beginning July 1, all new and/or 
replaced residential toilets must be of the low-flush variety. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said that she expects about 250,000 such toilets installed in the 
first year, which would save an estimated 476 million gallons of water. That's 
enough water, her staff pointed out, to fill the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
four times over. And, perhaps, wash the Raiders out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Joe hasn't been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The headstone of the 19th-Century Downey resident disappeared from a local 
cemetery last year, but Ed Lewis and the Greenleaf 4-H club have come to the 
rescue. They're constructing a duplicate -- a 2 1/2-foot-tall redwood marker 
that will bear the original painted inscription: 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good Indian while he lived. He belonged to the Kaweah. He lived in 
Downey 22 years and died November 22, 1895." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he's making this marker longer so that it can sit deeper in the 
cement. "Last time it was in cement, too, and they (the thieves) just dug the 
whole thing out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, who died at about the age of 55, was something of a local medicine man who 
shared his home remedies with local residents, said Joyce Lawrence of the 
Downey Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
In an obituary on Joe, a Downey newspaper noted that he lived his last years 
outdoors. Once he had lived in a shed near the tracks of the Southern Pacific 
Railroad, the article said, but after a storm blew the shed down on him, he 
"could never be induced to sleep under a roof again." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, you can find valet parking for everything from movie 
premieres and the Beverly Hills post office to barbecued ribs joints. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes an event so big that a $5 valet charge is being assessed drivers -- 
and the charge must be paid by mail 10 days early.

Despite fears of American indulgence in satanist rituals, a prominent 
researcher of American religious movements says "there is no real evidence of 
growth in satanic activities over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, aside from two groups in San Francisco and one in New Haven, Conn., 
Gordon Melton, author of the Encyclopedia of American Religions, said, "it is 
hard to find real-life satanic groups." 
</P>
<P>
Melton is a United Methodist minister who works full-time in research through 
his Santa Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion. He 
described his current findings at a meeting of the Religion Newswriters Assn. 
last weekend in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Melton charged that "misinformation" about satanic activities has been 
"floating around police departments." But, he said, satanic cults are rarely 
found behind reports of church break-ins, graveyard desecrations and animal 
mutilations. 
</P>
<P>
When a fascination with satanic symbols is discovered it tends to be from 
"ephemeral teen groups or drug cults." Melton said he has traced several 
stories of ritual child abuse back to the influence of one book. He dismissed 
satanic imagery in rock lyrics as devices intended to shock parents. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened since the mid-1980s," Melton said, "is that people have been 
mobilized to share satanic fears." 
</P>
<P>
Any manifestation of satanism is short-lived because it "is not a true 
religion, but a parody of religion, based on a reaction to Christianity," he 
said. To that extent, he added, "Christian literature is a carrier of 
satanism." 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert Schuller, pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, 
preached his gospel of self-esteem at an auxiliary meeting of Southern Baptists 
on Monday in Las Vegas. He has always been a Reformed Church in America 
minister but he credited a Southern Baptist with influencing his notion of an 
ideal pastorate. Schuller said he wrote a term paper in the seminary about 
George W. Truett, who was pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas from 
1897 to 1944. Since then, Schuller said he looked for "a church where I could 
spend my whole life." He began his present congregation from scratch at a 
drive-in movie theater in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
EVENT 
</P>
<P>
A "Gospel Freedom Fest" today will feature six choirs and speakers marking the 
13th anniversary of the Soweto uprising in South Africa. It is part of a 
campaign to pressure South Africa to end its policy of apartheid, said 
spokeswoman Norma Foster. Among speakers will be the Rev. Pierre van den 
Heever, a representative of the South African Council of Churches. "The 
churches in South Africa are feeling threatened" and are seeking support in the 
United States against apartheid, Foster said. South African singer Letta Mbulu 
will join the musical program. The event will be held from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at 
the First A.M.E. Church, 2270 S. Harvard Blvd. in Los Angeles. JOHN DART

HALT THE DECLINE AT MONO LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles should realize by now that it never will win its dogged legal 
battle to continue its historic diversion of eastern Sierra streams that 
naturally flow into Mono Lake. As long as the Department of Water and Power 
takes as much water as it has over the years, the level of the unique lake 300 
miles north of Los Angeles will continue to drop. At some point, the decline 
must be halted. Now is an appropriate time because any further reduction is 
certain to trigger additional environmental damage, according to a long series 
of scientific studies that have been conducted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, the DWP argued in El Dorado County Superior Court last week that it 
needs to lower the lake even further so it can conduct even more scientific 
studies to see whether, indeed, there would be any environmental harm. But one 
could follow that line of reasoning on and on, until the lake is a lake no 
more. Mono Lake now is 6,377 feet above sea level, very close to its historic 
low and the point at which Negrit Island, an important nesting area for the 
California gull, is connected to the shore by a land bridge and thus becomes 
accessible to coyotes and other predators. 
</P>
<P>
Four studies have recommended that the lake level not be allowed to drop below 
6,377 feet and that it be maintained at between 6,377 feet and 6,390 feet. The 
Mono Lake Committee and the Audubon Society argued for an injunction to halt 
the decline at 6,377 feet. There is plenty of evidence in the 10-year court 
fight over Mono Lake to justify such a ruling. The lake level has dropped 40 
feet since the diversions began in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
The city, of course, will lose water -- an estimated 63,000 acre-feet during 
the next year, or about 15% of the city's annual consumption. The department 
also will lose the electric power generated as the water falls through the Los 
Angeles Aqueduct en route to the city. Negotiations are under way to find 
replacement water. Until that is achieved, the city can make up the loss from 
its entitlement from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Both city officials and state Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) are 
right when they say the state and federal governments should help compensate 
Los Angeles, since Mono Lake needs to be protected both as a statewide and 
national environmental asset. Isenberg is sponsoring legislation to do that. 
And he noted correctly in a recent speech: "If we don't step in, Los Angeles is 
going to lose about 10 years from now, but the lake will be dead. And that will 
be no victory at all."

HELP FOR BABIES OF ADDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drugs, alcohol and pregnancy can be a damaging, if not deadly, combination. By 
conservative estimate, cocaine use alone during pregnancy harms 12,000 babies a 
year in California. Yet few hospitals have programs to treat an expectant 
mother's addiction or the money to pay for the expensive care that drug babies 
require after birth. 
</P>
<P>
Two pending bills sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San 
Francisco) could help the state meet the growing problem of such infants. One, 
AB 741, would establish pilot treatment programs in six counties and declare 
the state's intent to extend these programs statewide in future years. The 
other would enable the state to get federal money to pay much of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
Because the first step is finding pregnant women who are drinking heavily or 
using drugs and need special help, AB 741 would provide for teaching social 
workers, shelter managers and medical professionals how to identify women at 
risk and get help for them. Both residential and out-patient programs must be 
provided, and simple detoxification programs are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
By helping mothers, such programs really help children. Babies born to women 
addicted to drugs or alcohol are more likely to be born prematurely than those 
of women who are not addicts, and that reduces a baby's chance of survival. 
Even helping addicted women late in their pregnancy can improve the odds of a 
healthier baby. As in so many cases, early treatment is not only humane but 
also less expensive. One prenatal visit costs $60 to $90 as opposed to $1,000 a 
day for care in an intensive care unit for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
Babies born to drug abusers are sometimes mentally retarded. They may have 
deformed internal organs or be particularly vulnerable to infection. Some may 
carry the acquired immune deficiency virus. When they enter school, they may 
also have severe learning problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration has indicated a willingness to spend $8 million 
on pilot projects in four counties, a welcome sign. Speier's bill would cost 
around $12 or $13 million and establish programs in Alameda, Los Angeles, 
Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco counties as well as one unnamed rural 
county. It also would plan expansion to 10 more counties. That's a sensible 
approach and would put California firmly on the road to helping what have been 
the forgotten victims of drug and alcohol addiction.

A BOOST FOR HOME BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYERS SEE VALUE IN SUBSIDIZING THE COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FLYNN and DANIEL HOFFMAN, Dan Flynn is on leave from the office of state 
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and is a research assistant at the American 
Affordable Housing Institute at Rutgers University. Daniel Hoffman is the 
research director at the institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California housing prices are now so far out of sight that the American Dream 
of home ownership has become a pipe dream for many of the state's residents. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, and particularly in California, the rate of home ownership 
has declined throughout the decade, primarily because incomes have not kept 
pace with rapidly increasing housing costs. According to the California Assn. 
of Realtors, the median family income rose by 234% between 1970 and 1987, but 
during this same time period housing costs soared by 580%. As a result, only 
26% of California households could afford to purchase the median-priced home of 
$165,600 last year. In contrast, 49% of the nation's households were able to 
purchase the national median-priced home, which cost $89,700. 
</P>
<P>
To date, most of the housing affordability and availability crisis has been 
borne by young families who wish to buy a home, others who seek decent, 
affordable rentals and by the thousands of people living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is increasing evidence that individual businesses and the 
California economy as a whole are beginning to suffer the consequences of high 
housing costs. Employees are moving farther away from work sites in search of 
affordable housing, leading to longer commutes and reduced productivity. 
Concern over commuter-generated auto pollution has caused the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District to consider denying permits for some new factories. 
</P>
<P>
Employers are finding it increasingly difficult to fill jobs, retain vital 
personnel and expand their businesses. Even those businesses that are not yet 
experiencing labor shortages are facing higher wage demands and increased costs 
to compensate employees relocating from other regions. This trend is 
particularly noticeable among Silicon Valley firms. Nationally, the costs of 
relocation are daunting: A 1986 Merrill Lynch survey estimated that roughly 
1,300 companies spend about $15 billion annually to relocate employees. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, high housing costs drive businesses out of the state. Signs of this 
are already appearing. For example, Patagonia, an outdoor clothing 
manufacturer, recently moved its prosperous mail order division from Ventura, 
Calif., to Bozeman, Mont., because, according to a company spokeswoman, 
"housing costs made it difficult to recruit entry-level workers." Joel Singer, 
chief economist for the California Assn. of Realtors, sums up the situation, 
saying that high housing costs "ultimately could make California a 
noncompetitive economy." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, California businesses can play a major role in addressing their 
labor shortage and productivity problems while making housing more affordable, 
reducing auto-generated pollution and shortening commutes. Across the nation, 
more and more businesses are offering cost-effective employer-assisted housing 
benefit programs. Employers are structuring these benefit programs in several 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Colgate-Palmolive Co. has negotiated with a lender to obtain for 
its employees highly competitive long-term mortgage financing. The firm also 
has a closing-cost subsidy program that can save the borrower a mortgage 
closing payment of up to 1.5% of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
In another example, the University of Pennsylvania offers guaranteed mortgages, 
enabling employees to obtain a mortgage without a down payment. The program is 
cost-free to the employer unless the employee defaults. There has been only one 
default in the 20 years that the program has been in effect. The university 
also has used the program to stabilize and revitalize the area around its 
campus. This is done by offering this guarantee only on homes adjacent to the 
campus. This model could be of particular interest to California employers 
whose employees are plagued by long commutes. 
</P>
<P>
Firms or groups of firms, such as the Coastal Housing Partnership in Santa 
Barbara, are working with lenders to develop second mortgage down-payment loan 
programs. Some of these programs have deferred repayment agreements, while 
others have shared-appreciation features that enable both the employee and the 
employer to benefit from the real estate price boom. One bank in North Carolina 
makes down payment loans to its tellers and other entry-level personnel. If the 
employee stays with the bank for five years, the entire down-payment loan is 
forgiven. The lender says that after five years the loan has paid for itself in 
improved employee retention and productivity and in reduced recruitment costs. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms and institutions have gone as far as to actually build new housing. 
UC Irvine has done this, having built more than 400 homes for university 
employees. Some of these homes are available to employees earning as little as 
$20,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
These are but some of the innovative approaches that businesses are taking to 
address the serious business problem of affordable housing for employees. 
Californians need not endure two-hour commutes and endless tons of auto exhaust 
emissions. California business need not relocate to other states or pay 
exorbitant relocation benefits, which don't really solve the bulk of the 
employee recruitment and retention problem anyway. Rather, California business 
leaders should seek to develop innovative, broad-based, cost-effective, 
employer-assisted housing programs, and should insist on supportive public 
policies to facilitate these programs.

FUROR OVER GOP MEMO ON FOLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with interest that I read the two front-page articles (June 8) 
concerning the reprehensible behavior of those in the highest echelons of the 
Republican political organization ("GOP Aide Quits in Furor Over Memo on Foley" 
and "Ethics Epidemic: Fingers Are Pointed at the Media"). They are especially 
fascinating when paired with another front-page story of that day, "House Votes 
Restrictions on FSX Deal With Japan," detailing some minor curtailments on what 
looks like a wholesale giveaway of American technology, a deal strongly backed 
by the current Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a hidden benefit in this handing over of years-long research and 
testing to a country that has barely concealed disdain for the idea of 
establishing a civilized trade relationship? We seem to be saying, if they 
won't buy our know-how, we'll have to just bestow it upon them. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same shortsighted, parochial attitude that approves the dismissal of 
issues and debate in favor of demagoguery. In the ethics article, it was no 
surprise to find a Republican political adviser revealing that popular 
television shows with neo-fascists at the helm are plumbed for topics of an 
acceptable level of ugliness. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview about the release of the so-called attack memo, 
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater said he was almost certain 
that had he seen the memo in question, it wouldn't have gone out. Almost. 
Atwater felt no need even to voice the empty phrases of assurance and outrage 
that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and President Bush managed. It is hard not 
to entertain the thought that the mid-level RNC staffer who supposedly resigned 
in shame didn't slip right into a better, job with a sympathetic agency head. 
</P>
<P>
The composite picture is an ominous one -- a group of power mongers who care 
nothing for the good of the country as a country, as a diverse whole with a 
need for sensible leadership, as an entity which must endure beyond their 
average life spans. This denotes an exclusive interest in the short term, and 
carries the pervasive odor of wanting to rule, rather than govern.

MAN MISTAKEN FOR SUSPECT SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been troubled ever since I read your news story about an unarmed man, 
Marcus Donel, who was shot by a sheriff's deputy in the driveway of his 
apartment after having driven up with his stepbrother, Terry Curb ("Man 
Mistaken for Robbery Suspect Is Slain by Deputy," Metro, June 1). A $200 
robbery had occurred 30 minutes earlier about a block from Mr. Donel's 
apartment. Even though the description of the bandit was not of the same race, 
13 years younger, 4 inches shorter and 35 pounds lighter, the police evidently 
thought they had their man. (After all he was the same sex.) 
</P>
<P>
I was further disturbed that after shooting Mr. Donel they took Curb into 
custody and tried to get him identified by the victim as the robber. I shudder 
at the inhumanity of making 20-year-old Curb go through this after experiencing 
the trauma of seeing his brother mistakenly gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
I was moved to tears by the time I read that Mr. Donel was a hard-working man 
and a devoted family man -- the sole support for his common-law wife, his two 
girls (11 and 10 years) and his stepbrother. Not only was this unfortunate 
incident a personal tragedy for Mr. Donel, but for those people he loved and 
who depended on him. 
</P>
<P>
Why did this happen? There will be an investigation by the Sheriff's 
Department, but will the truth be found and justice done? Are we just going to 
hear rationalizations for why the deputies did this? 
</P>
<P>
In the article Sgt. Ernie Roop is quoted as saying, "If he (Mr. Donel) didn't 
commit the robbery, he probably shouldn't have been doing what he was doing." 
Why isn't Sgt. Roop concerned whether the deputies were doing what they were 
supposed to be doing? Is the Sheriff's Department actively trying to root out 
its weak links? Is the Sheriff's Department using the same standard to detect 
crime in its own department as it is in the community?

FUROR OVER GOP MEMO ON FOLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with your editorial "Politics and Guttersnipes" (June 8) that if you're 
to throw mud at all, you should make it stick. Have you noticed, however, how 
much of the mud has been slung in the direction of Democrats lately? 
</P>
<P>
(Former House Speaker) Jim Wright has resigned, probably with good reason; then 
there was (former Democratic Whip) Tony Coehlo too. And attacks have started on 
Bill Gray of Philadelphia. One begins to wonder if Republicans are such 
bastions of virtue that they are above such reproach. But when the Republican 
National Committee in a memo by Mark Goodin sought to impugn the impeccable 
credentials of the new Speaker, Thomas Foley, with innuendoes of homosexuality, 
I began to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, I was reading a passage from "The Nightmare Years: 1930 to 
1940" by William Shirer when the story about Goodin's calumny broke in the 
news. Shirer wrote about the demise of German Gen. Werner von Fritsch, the 
commander-in-chief of the army, in 1938. Heinrich Himmler with the aid of 
Reinhard Heydrich had sent Hitler "documentary proof" that Von Fritsch was 
guilty of "homosexual offenses." Von Fritsch was fired but was later exonerated 
by a military court even though he was never restored to his office nor Himmler 
nor Heydrich ever reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
The disanalogy is that Goodin was forced to resign, Foley seems to be 
vindicated and policy-maker Lee Atwater appears to have survived the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Should one worry about an upcoming fire in the Reichstag?

STEEP HEALTH INSURANCE INCREASES FOR INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I sympathize with John Meyer regarding Blue Cross increases. I am a single 
person, age 61, and healthy (no claims in several years). My premium rates have 
been raised over 30% in 1988 and another 43% starting in July. My premium is 
now $675 per quarter, $1,000 deductible. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to ask the state Board of Insurance why the individual rates have 
increased and not the group rates -- is that discrimination or not? I was under 
the impression that California wanted to reduce the number of uninsured; by the 
latest premium raise the state will find thousands more to add to the 5 million 
already uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross spokeswoman Jeannette Hartman made a statement that the average 
increase was approximately 17%. I would like to know how she arrived at those 
figures. If I can have enormous increases, what kind of increases must people 
have who made claims for significant or insignificant illnesses? 
</P>
<P>
When will the ordinary hard-working people get fair treatment?

FOSTER PARENTS IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your very thoughtful and compassionate article regarding foster 
parents ("The Stand-Ins: Foster Parents Who Stick With County Program Take 
Their Roles Seriously," by Myrna Oliver, Metro May 30). 
</P>
<P>
The article clearly demonstrates the quality of care and genuine concern that 
foster parents bring to abused and neglected children in this county. Our 
programs for children simply could not function without foster parents -- they 
are the heartbeat of the entire program. For those children who cannot be 
returned to their natural parents, or who must have a specialized placement in 
a group home, foster parents are the only resource. 
</P>
<P>
We have some 3,800 foster parents in Los Angeles County who are constantly 
called upon at all hours of the day and night to provide services to children 
who often have been in deep trauma. It is a tribute to foster parents that most 
of these children are able to have stable and productive lives as a result of 
the care given them by foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
It should also be understood that money received by foster parents goes for the 
needs of children and does not constitute any form of payment for services to 
foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks again for a terrific article.

It was my belief that with the dirty tactics used by the Republican National

they would be satisfied with their accomplishment.

It now seems that the chairman of the committee is obsessed with innuendo and

Bush would do a great service to the party and country by firing the GOP

Blue Cross premiums "raised 25%." That's a joke. My premium increased to $531 
per quarter from $294, which is an increase of 80%. Any my benefits decreased. 
I can either pay it and complain or drop it and be uninsured. Not much of a 
choice. In the 4 1/2 years since I have had this insurance, my premium has 
increased almost 300% from $186.03 to $531 per quarter. And get this -- I have 
never used it nor turned in a claim. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say I am looking into other sources of medical insurance, as this 
is ridiculous. How many others "suffered" an 80% increase in their premium? 
Where does Blue Cross get this 25% increase? Is there any type of a regulatory 
agency that oversees its operations and could look into this?

<P>
There is pressure enough while playing in a U.S. Open, but now Curtis Strange 
has the added burden of being in position to become the first player to win 
consecutive titles since Ben Hogan in 1950 and '51. 
</P>
<P>
Strange moved quickly to the top of the leader board Friday by shooting a 64, 
six under par, for a 36-hole total of 135 at Oak Hill Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA player of the year in 1988 with earnings of more than $1 million, 
Strange held a one-stroke lead over Tom Kite, who had a 69 to go with the 67 he 
shot Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Simpson, the former USC star who won the Open in 1987, also remained in 
contention. He shot a par 70 for a two-day total of 137 and was tied with Jay 
Don Blake, who shot a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen players were within five shots of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Strange made two birdies and an eagle on the first five holes to pick up 
momentum early on a day when a brief rainstorm postponed play for 14 minutes 
late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
When someone asked Strange if he'd had a notion that he was in the lead after 
holing a 115-yard wedge shot for an eagle on the par-five, 570-yard fourth 
hole, he responded dryly: 
</P>
<P>
"When that thing went in, I knew I wasn't far from it. I told myself I didn't 
want to back off now." 
</P>
<P>
Strange was, of course, gratified by his round, which included five birdies and 
an eagle. He had only one bogey, at the par-four, 458-yard 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I played really good and kept my thoughts where they should be," he said. "But 
it's only Friday, and we have a long ways to go. Tomorrow is the important 
round, the one in which you want to stay close." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Miller set the U.S. Open record for one round with a 63 in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Strange said he didn't give it a thought when he was on the course with its 
tight fairways and penalizing rough. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't care less because 64 isn't bad," he added. 
</P>
<P>
And when someone told him that he had tied the course record set by Hogan in 
1942 and equaled by Jeff Sluman in 1987, Strange said: "You don't give a darn 
what you shoot. You just block it out and think about your game." 
</P>
<P>
Strange wasn't being disrespectful of records, but winning the Open is a much 
higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were continually reminding Strange of the pressure of trying to 
emulate Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
Strange smiled and said, "I was going along having a good time here and I was 
surprised how calm I was. I won't be as calm now." 
</P>
<P>
Strange, 34, doesn't have to be reminded about chasing the ghost of Hogan's 
accomplishment. He has been told enough about it all year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Open gets your blood flowing," he said. "You want to do well because 
you're the defending champion." 
</P>
<P>
Strange hasn't won on the PGA Tour this year and he said he just hasn't played 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
But he was obviously proud of his 64 on a demanding course. 
</P>
<P>
"It was better than any round that I shot last year at Brookline (Mass.), he 
said, referring to the 1988 Open. 
</P>
<P>
Strange said he maintains an outwardly calm demeanor on the course but admitted 
that he's more nervous than he might appear to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it begins," he said. "Jack Nicklaus once told me that you can't win the 
Open on Thursday and Friday, but you can lose it." 
</P>
<P>
Kite, 39, is recognized as, perhaps, the best active player who hasn't won a 
major event -- the U.S. Open, Masters, British Open and PGA Championship. He's 
in position now. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have as easy a day today as I had Thursday when I shot 67," Kite 
said. "But it was more of a satisfying round because I wasn't driving that 
well. I just hung in there when I could have knocked myself out." 
</P>
<P>
Kite had three birdies and two bogeys in his round of 69. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the pressure on Strange as the defending champion, Kite said: "I 
don't think a one-shot lead at this point makes much difference. There are guys 
who are seven or eight shots back who still have a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
Strange beat Kite last November in a playoff at the rich Nabisco Championships 
in Pebble Beach. Kite had won at least one tournament for seven consecutive 
years, but he was shut out in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who is paired with Strange today, said they were going to have as much 
fun as the competition will allow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're good friends," Kite said, adding, "I haven't had much fun in the Open." 
</P>
<P>
Kite's best finish in 17 previous Opens was a tie for eighth. He has missed the 
cut six times. 
</P>
<P>
Some prominent players missed the cut Friday, namely Ben Crenshaw, Sandy Lyle, 
Bob Tway, Fuzzy Zoeller and Lee Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said he wasn't hitting the ball especially well, but his chipping saved 
him in his round of 70. He had four birdies that were offset by four bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how he felt while trying to defend his Open championship last year, 
Simpson said, "I was pretty relaxed. People said a defending champion couldn't 
win and that helped me to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson gave it a good try, though, leading after two rounds and only one shot 
behind after 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pressure will bother Curtis," Simpson said. "He's a great 
player, a real good iron player. He has a chance to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, 33, is confident, too, about his own game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just thankful I'm playing good," he said. "Winning in Atlanta (three weeks 
ago) helped my confidence a lot. And it's a lot of fun to play well in the 
Open." 
</P>
<P>
Now the question is, how much longer will the fun last for Simpson, Kite -- and 
Strange. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, who was one stroke off the lead with his 67 Thursday, soared to 
a 74 Friday for a 36-hole total of 141. . . . Jay Don Blake, Payne Stewart and 
Bernhard Langer were the co-leaders Thursday, each shooting a 66. Blake slipped 
two shots behind Curtis Strange. Langer had a miserable round of 78 (144 
total), while Stewart shot a 75 (141). . . . The cut was at 145. . . . Tom 
Pernice, the former UCLA player, had a 75 after shooting a 67 Thursday. . . . 
Nick Faldo, the Masters champion, is at 140 after shooting a 72. . . . There 
were 21 sub-par rounds Thursday, breaking the first-round Open record of 19 set 
in 1980. . . . There were 17 sub-par rounds Friday.

DAVIS' HOMER HELPS ANGELS END TWO SLUMPS IN DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The slumps had grown together and they had grown ugly. Before Friday night, the 
Angels had not won a game or hit a home run since June 6, a span of nine days 
or seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis, a man largely responsible for ending both droughts, believes that 
their coexistence was more than coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for us to hit home runs," said Davis, whose three-run shot in 
the second inning helped the Angels score a 9-4 victory over the Detroit 
Tigers. "We're not the Cardinals. We're not the speediest team in baseball, or 
the league, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some power. That's our weapon. If we're not using it, we're going to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader had noticed the same thing. Before Davis, the last 
Angel to hit a home run was Claudell Washington, whose solo homer June 6 was 
the difference in a 2-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians. Since then, Rader 
had watched his team go 0-7, managing just 12 runs while being shut out twice. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't hit home runs," Rader observed, "you're not going to win too 
often. You've got to hit the ball over the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Davis did. Two innings later, Jack Howell did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the Angels were on their way to their first victory of this trip and 
their fourth win in June. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a long wait, and the Angels, for the most part, seemed unfamiliar 
with the procedure. As soon as Davis deposited his seventh home run into the 
upper deck in right field, the Angel effort deteriorated into basic retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The saving factor in the Angels' play the rest of the way was the fact that 
Detroit, the last-place team in the American League East, was providing the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the fifth inning, center fielder Devon White and right fielder 
Washington let a fly ball by Keith Moreland drop between them for a bloop 
double that scored Lou Whitaker from first base. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the eighth inning, Rader had to resort to three pitchers to retire the 
side. After starter Bert Blyleven allowed two hits and a run, Rich Monteleone 
was summoned and walked the only batter he faced. Then Bryan Harvey walked the 
first batter he faced, before finally striking out Mike Brumley for the third 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the ninth inning, Harvey walked two more batters, took a line drive off 
his right foot and yielded another run. Finally, he got the last out by 
striking out Chet Lemon to bring an end to nearly 3 1/2 hours of take-it, 
no-you-take-it baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, Angel catcher Lance Parrish dropped the final strike, having to 
spring from his crouch and throw to first base to record the out. 
</P>
<P>
"Whew," Rader said. "I didn't think we played as well as we should've, but I 
have to be grateful we won. Any time you're in a dead streak like we're in, 
you'll take anything. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to move a runner over -- and we didn't. We needed to get a bunt down 
-- and we didn't. We needed to throw some strikes -- and we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But we won." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, meanwhile, literally limped away from this one. A ninth-inning 
collision between Davis and Detroit catcher Matt Nokes sent Nokes sprawling, 
leaving him with a partially torn ligament in his left knee. The injury, 
sustained when Davis tried to score standing up and ran straight into Nokes' 
locked leg, will sideline the catcher for four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't slide because I was dead at the plate," Davis explained. "I wasn't 
trying to run over him, but as it turned out, I had to run into him . . . If I 
slid, I probably would have broken my ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that happens in the game. Now, there are some guys you might 
want to take a cheap shot at, but Matt's not one of them. I played with Matt 
(in San Francisco). He's a good guy. Hopefully, he won't be out too long." 
</P>
<P>
So it goes for the reeling Tigers. Detroit began the day by putting outfielder 
Fred Lynn on the disabled list and with rookie Mike Schwabe on the mound, 
starting in place of the injured Jack Morris. Schwabe (1-2) lasted but 4 2/3 
innings against the Angels, allowing five runs on seven hits -- the most 
damaging being Davis' three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never seen him before," Davis said of the rookie right-hander. "I'd never 
heard of him. I thought he was an investment firm." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Davis had been officially introduced to Schwabe, the Angels were en 
route to ending a losing streak that began in Anaheim and took them through 
Kansas City and Texas, all the way to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The question over what to do with Kyle Abbott's $190,000 signing bonus -- give 
it to him in one lump sum or split it evenly over two years -- was finally 
settled Friday. Striking a compromise that will pay Abbott more than half of 
the bonus in 1989 and the rest in 1990, the Angels signed their No. 1 draft 
choice and immediately assigned him to Quad City, their single-A farm club. 
Quad City is a member of the Midwest League, making Abbott the second member of 
his family to play in the league. Abbott's father, Larry, pitched for rival 
Burlington in the late 1960s. "And my mother was pregnant with me at the time," 
Abbott said. "So I know the park, I just don't remember seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels Go To Midland: So how did the Angels enjoy their day off Thursday, 
which they spent bussing and flying to Midland, Tex., for an exhibition game 
against their double-A farm team? "Awesome," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's 
always nice to see the Permian Oil Basin again." The Angels took the event 
somewhat less than seriously, with Rader, at one point, fielding an infield 
consisting of coach Deron Johnson at first base, coach Bobby Knoop at second 
and Rader at third. "We also had (bullpen coach) Joe Coleman in the outfield," 
Rader reported, "but after one inning, we had to get him out of there." Rader 
let his third baseman play awhile, though. "I had a backhand and a dive," Rader 
said, grinning and turning up in his nose. "I only had one problem: My cannon's 
not too good. I can't throw, I can't see, my legs are slow. The only thing I 
can do is catch it. Everything else is shot." Rader also batted twice, flying 
out to center field and striking out. "He throws me a slider and punches me 
out," Rader said with disgust. "A damn slider. I tell you, that kid is 
history." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels did have one no-show in Midland. Outfielder Claudell Washington 
missed the team bus from the hotel to the airport, which caused him to miss the 
team charter from Dallas to Midland. Washington hailed a cab but got lost at 
the Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport, which can happen. "We held the plane, we looked 
for him at the terminal, we had him paged," Rader said. "That airport's so big, 
you take a wrong turn and you can be wandering around for a half-hour." Charter 
gone, Washington purchased a ticket to Detroit and met the team there when they 
arrived Thursday night. That move might have spared Washington a fine from 
Rader. "There were extenuating circumstances, and he did get his own plane 
ticket," the manager said. "The expense of getting up here is a fine in 
itself."

GLAVINE, BRAVES TAKE STEAM OUT OF DODGERS' STREAK, 6-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, Tom Lasorda was desperate. His Dodgers were dropping in the 
standings as fast as he was dropping pounds. 
</P>
<P>
So Lasorda moved Kirk Gibson into the leadoff spot and moved from the dugout 
into the third base coaching box, and the Dodgers won five straight, their 
longest winning streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Gibson and Lasorda had cured the Dodgers' woes, but left-hander 
Tom Glavine and the Atlanta Braves stopped Los Angeles' streak, 6-1, Friday 
night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Will Gibson stay in the leadoff spot and will Lasorda remain in the third base 
coaching box? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," the Dodger manager said. "Come out to the game Saturday. We win 
five games in a row and you come in and want to know will Gibson bat leadoff. 
If I told you he wasn't (going to bat leadoff), I might change my mind and 
you'd call me a liar." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 33,372 saw Glavine beat the Dodgers for the third time this season. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-game loser last season, Glavine was 0-5 with a 7.90 earned-run average 
against the Dodgers in 1988. But he is unbeaten against them this season and 
hasn't allowed an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Why the turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to be a lot more aggressive," Glavine said. "I don't know why I've 
had such success against the Dodgers this season. Maybe I'm a litle bit lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally got fed up with (losing), so I figured, if I was going to be beat, I 
might as well be beaten pitching aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
After defeating the Dodgers, 6-1, in the Braves' home opener, Glavine pitched a 
3-0 victory over Los Angeles last week in Atlanta, allowing only six hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Glavine has changed a lot in one year," Gibson said. "Either he's better or 
we're worse. He's doing something right, and we're doing something wrong 
against him." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Glavine worked 7 2/3 innings, yielding eight singles and striking 
out eight. He also helped himself by tripling in a run in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine worked his way out of a jam in the fifth inning after Gibson and Willie 
Randolph got consecutive two-out singles. But Glavine struck out Jose Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up a two-out single to Eddie Murray in the eighth inning, Glavine 
was replaced by Joe Boever, who got Jeff Hamilton to pop out to second. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tommy (Glavine) is getting back at the Dodgers for what they did to 
him last year," Brave Manager Russ Nixon said. "He's getting more first-pitch 
strikes and his changeup has improved. We couldn't ask for more." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Leary didn't fare as well for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
He retired Lonnie Smith to open the game, but the next batter, Jeff Treadway, 
smashed Leary's first pitch over the wall in right-center field for his third 
home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got to Glavine in the third to tie it, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
After Alfredo Griffin opened the inning by beating out a grounder to shortstop, 
Leary followed with a single to short right field. Glavine struck out Gibson, 
but the runners advanced when Randolph grounded out to second. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine looked as if he had worked his way out of the jam when he got Gonzalez 
to pop up, but Glavine lost the ball in the lights, and Griffin, who had faked 
a steal of home earlier, raced home to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves got the run back in the fourth when Dale Murphy led off with a 
ground-rule double and scored on Ron Gant's sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
Leary departed, trailing, 4-1, after allowing two more runs in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Leary didn't have good command of his pitches and that made the difference," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' offense was no help, either. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, making his fifth start of the season in right field, was one for four 
as the replacement for Davis, who doesn't start against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Murray continued his slump, going hitless in his first three at-bats before 
collecting a two-out single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, however, said he is not considering resting Murray for a game. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Ken Landreaux, who played for the Dodgers in 1981-87, signed a minor 
league contract Friday. Landreaux, 34, who had been playing in the Mexican 
Summer League, is expected to join the Dodgers' triple-A Albuquerque club. An 
11-year veteran, Landreaux has a career batting average of .268. . . . Tim 
Leary, who won a silver bat last year as the Dodgers' best hitting pitcher, got 
his first hit of the season in the second inning of Friday night's game. . . . 
The Dodgers are 8-2 with Manager Tom Lasorda coaching at third base.

I'm sure the Lakers are not, and they shouldn't be, ashamed of their play

MAYBE DODGERS SHOULD WORK A LITTLE HARDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The more I think about it, the more I believe that last year's Dodger 
championship was pure luck. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team has a better pitching staff, with the addition of Mike Morgan, 
and a better right side of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
But a winner is not someone who rests on his laurels after one little 
championship. Just look at the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
No one is suggesting that the Dodgers win four consecutive championships, just 
that they look as if they want to win four consecutive championships.

I can't be the only one who sees it: If the Dodgers want to use Alejandro Pea, 
let him start. 
</P>
<P>
That way, they can yank him if he gets into trouble, before the game gets out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, I used to say the same thing about Charlie Hough and Dave 
Stewart.

<TEXT>
<P>
Third-seeded Mats Wilander of Sweden, weakened by stomach problems, lost to 
Paul Annacone in the Queens Club grass-court tennis championships Friday in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not feel good from the beginning," said Wilander, who was defeated, 6-2, 
6-4. "It is just something that is going around and started in the morning. I 
just didn't feel up to it." 
</P>
<P>
Annacone, who will face top-seeded Ivan Lendl in the semifinals, took advantage 
of the situation, attacking often. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl was also pressed but had enough left to beat Michael Stich of West 
Germany, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Others advancing to the semifinals were Derrick Rostagno, who turned back Gary 
Muller of South Africa, 6-7 (9-7), 6-2, 6-2, and Christo van Rensburg of South 
Africa, who downed Chris Bailey of Britain, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova advanced to a semifinal match against Elna Reinach of South 
Africa in a tournament at Edgbaston, England. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova was almost invincible on her own serve, giving up only seven points 
in a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Australian qualifier Kristine Radford. 
</P>
<P>
Reinach defeated American Betsy Nagelsen, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, second-seeded Zina Garrison will meet defending 
champion Claudia Kohde-Kilsch of West Germany. Garrison eliminated Japanese 
qualifier Kimiko Date, 6-3, 6-2, and the fifth-seeded Kohde-Kilsch beat Ann 
Henricksson, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe overwhelmed Argentina's Horacio De La Pena, 6-3, 6-3, in a 
grass-court tournament at Edinburgh, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe lost to De La Pena in the first round of the 1987 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe will face Aaron Krickstein, who advanced when Brad Gilbert withdrew 
because of a stomach muscle injury. Gilbert was leading, 7-5, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Ronald Agenor of Haiti made a string of unforced errors and 
double faults en route to a 7-6, 6-1 loss to Roberto Azar, 23, of Argentina, in 
the quarterfinals of a tournament at Bologna, Italy.

CLEMENS JUST WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED FOR BOSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox, who lately have been putting more players in the infirmary 
than runs on the scoreboard, turned to their pitching ace, Roger Clemens, for 
help Friday night at Chicago, and the two-time Cy Young award winner provided 
an antedote -- a two-hit, 2-0 shutout of the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Ater hearing the bad news that center fielder Ellis Burks would undergo surgery 
for torn cartilage in his left shoulder and be lost four to six weeks, joining 
Jim Rice and Marty Barrett on the disabled list, the Red Sox were heartened as 
Clemens struck out a season-high 12. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (8-4) faced just 29 batters. It was the 21st shutout and sixth 
two-hitter of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens retired the first 10 men he faced before Steve Lyons singled to center 
with one out in the fourth inning. However, he was caught stealing. Ozzie 
Guillen singled to lead off the ninth, but Dave Gallagher hit into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Heep's infield single in the ninth inning scored Wade Boggs from third 
base. The run, given up by loser Ken Patterson (3-1), who relieved rookie Greg 
Hibbard, broke a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
New York 8-6, Texas 3-1 -- In a doubleheader that lasted nearly nine hours, the 
Yankees, led by pitchers Andy Hawkins and Jimmy Jones, swept the Rangers at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Yankees' second doubleheader sweep in a week. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Andy Hawkins, who has resumed throwing a cut fastball after 
dropping the pitch four years ago, allowed seven hits and no earned runs in 
eight-plus innings to even his record at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees broke a sixth-inning 2-2 tie with four runs off loser Bobby Witt 
(5-7). New York sent 10 batters to the plate, six of whom got hits, including 
Steve Sax, who had three for the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, delayed three times by rain, Jones (2-1) gave up three hits 
in six innings and left after the third delay. Dale Mohorcic and Dave Righetti 
finished in relief. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Palmeiro hit his first home run since May 4 for Texas. Don Mattingly led 
off the seventh inning against Drew Hall with his seventh homer. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 7-1, Baltimore 5-5 -- Jay Tibbs gave up six hits in seven innings, and 
Joe Orsulak drove in two runs as the Orioles beat the Athletics to gain a split 
at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbs (3-0) walked two, struck out six and during one stretch retired 10 
consecutive batters. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, one day after the Orioles turned the American League's first 
triple play of the season, the Athletics made five double plays. Ron Hassey 
drove in three runs with a single and a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Davis (5-3) got the win, although he allowed five hits and three earned 
runs in five innings. Rick Honeycutt, Oakland's fifth pitcher, earned his sixth 
save and the club's 25th, the most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire hit his 13th home run, off loser Brian Holton (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 1, Kansas City 0 -- A bases-loaded walk by Tom Gordon to Pete O'Brien 
in the bottom of the ninth inning enabled the Indians to win at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Black (6-7), pitching against his former teammates, yielded six hits, 
struck out five and walked two for his third complete game. He was traded to 
Cleveland for Pat Tabler last June. 
</P>
<P>
With two on and one out in the ninth, Gordon, who replaced loser Terry Leach 
(1-1), walked Dave Clark to load the bases. After Joe Carter flied to left 
field, O'Brien walked on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Luis Aquino, just off the disabled list with a stiff neck, started 
for the Royals and allowed five hits and one walk in six innings. He struck out 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Seattle 3 -- Fred McGriff's double and a wild pitch by reliever Mike 
Schooler with the bases loaded in the ninth inning helped the Blue Jays beat 
the Mariners at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler (1-1) relieved starter Brian Holman, who had a three-hitter until he 
gave up a leadoff single to Kelly Gruber in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler then hit George Bell. McGriff followed with a drive over the head of 
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. It bounced into the seats for a ground-rule 
double, scoring Gruber to tie the game. Ernie Whitt was walked intentionally to 
load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler, who has 14 saves this season, bounced a pitch to Rance Mulliniks, and 
Bell scored. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 8, Minnesota 6 -- Greg Brock's two-out, two-run single in the seventh 
inning helped the Brewers beat the Twins for the sixth consecutive time at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
With the Brewers trailing, 6-5, Brock, who missed the first two months of the 
season recuperating from shoulder surgery, lofted a fly ball off reliever Gary 
Wayne that hit inside the left-field line, scoring Gary Sheffield and Glenn 
Braggs.

EXPOS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SMITH WITH OFFENSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Right-hander Bryn Smith, who has been backed with an average of more than six 
runs a game this season by his Montreal teammates, was once again the recipient 
of timely hitting and scoring in the Expos' 8-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs 
Friday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The win, the Expos' fourth straight over Chicago this season, moved Montreal 
into first place in the NL East by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks and Andres Galarraga each had three hits and two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Smith (7-2) allowed five runs and nine hits in eight-plus innings. Tim Burke 
got the last three outs for his 14th save after Smith allowed singles to the 
first two batters in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks doubled home two runs and scored on Mike Fitzgerald's single as Montreal 
scored three runs in the first inning off Paul Kilgus (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs scored twice in the fifth on an RBI single by Dwight Smith and a 
run-scoring double by Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg also added his 10th home run in 
the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
New York 15, Philadelphia 11 -- The Mets squandered an eight-run first-inning 
lead, then outlasted the Phillies on a rainy night in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey Sasser put the Mets ahead, 12-11, with a two-run, pinch double in the 
eighth inning after the Phillies had taken an 11-10 lead in the seventh on a 
double by Von Hayes and a triple by Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets sent 13 batters to the plate in the first inning and scored eight runs 
on eight hits against Bruce Ruffin. 
</P>
<P>
But the Phillies came back against David Cone and scored five runs in the 
bottom of the first. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Myers (6-2) pitched 2 2/3 innings in relief for the victory. Steve 
Bedrosian (2-3) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, San Diego 1 -- Bill Doran and Glenn Davis hit home runs, and Jim 
Clancy (5-4) allowed five hits and no runs in 6 2/3 innings at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Smith pitched the ninth inning for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Young opened the game with a double against Ed Whitson (9-4), and one 
out later, Doran homered. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' 15th homer, leading off the fourth inning, was barely inside the 
left-field foul pole and sparked an argument that led to the ejection of Padre 
Manager Jack McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Pittsburgh 2 -- Scott Terry (5-6) allowed two runs and four hits 
in seven innings, and Milt Thompson drove in two runs to lead the Cardinals at 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Cardinals' third straight win and the ninth in their last 11 games. 
The Pirates have lost nine of their last 13. 
</P>
<P>
Pirate starter Randy Kramer (1-3) led, 2-1, going into the seventh inning, when 
the Cardinals scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Neal Heaton gave up run-scoring singles to Milt Thompson and Ozzie 
Smith before giving way to Doug Bair. Two more runs scored on a passed ball by 
catcher Junior Ortiz and a wild pitch by Bair. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, San Francisco 4 -- Pinch-hitter Eric Davis hit reliever Goose 
Gossage's first pitch for a two-run home run in the ninth inning, his 12th of 
the season, to cap a three-run rally and give the Reds the win at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Benzinger started the comeback with a leadoff double off Craig Lefferts, 
who replaced starter Rick Reuschel. Reuschel had been seeking his 12th win. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Paul O'Neill singled to score Benzinger. It was O'Neill's second 
RBI of the game and 10th of the season against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Norm Charlton (3-0) pitched a hitless eighth inning for the win, and 
John Franco took over in the ninth to earn his league-leading 18th save.

GROWTH SPURT LEFT AUDE HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Aude did not bowl over professional baseball scouts during his career at 
Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
He grew on them. 
</P>
<P>
Last year as a junior, Aude was a 6-foot-1 designated-hitter and part-time 
second baseman because, admittedly, he wasn't good enough to supplant Joel 
Wolfe at third base. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Aude is 6-5 and 185 pounds of developing muscle. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, the Pittsburgh Pirates selected Aude in the second round of the 
amateur draft -- he was the 48th pick overall -- projecting him as a third 
baseman, first baseman or outfielder in Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big kid that's long and lean with a lot of room to physically mature 
and get stronger," said Cam Bonifay, the Pirates' director of scouting. "We 
feel like he's going to be a big man with fine body control who could develop 
into a power hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly where, and for whom, Aude, 17, does his developing remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates have visited the Aude home three times bearing offers that have 
fallen substantially short of the six-figure bonus Aude reportedly is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Ferrer, the baseball coach at UC Santa Barbara, holds a signed 
letter of intent from Aude, who says he's prepared to hit the beach if the 
Pirates don't make the right pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I'm in the driver's seat," Aude said this week. "I'll just hold out 
until I get what I want or I'll go to Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Interesting phrasing coming from Aude, who has neither found the need to obtain 
a driver's license nor been a particular fan of academic pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate studying," said Aude, who nevertheless met the rigorous academic 
requirements for acceptance to the University of California system. "It's 
because I'm lazy I guess. I've never liked school." 
</P>
<P>
Other than baseball, Aude says he doesn't have a long list of interests. 
However, a well-rounded background never has been a necessary ingredient for 
success on the baseball field, especially while navigating through the minor 
leagues. In fact, Aude's single-mindedness and even demeanor are attributes 
that will probably help him cope with the day-in, day-out schedule of 
professional baseball -- whether he begins his pro career now or a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the ability," Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano said. "You hate to use the 
word potential, but you have to use it with him." 
</P>
<P>
For proof, just look at Aude's past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he batted .286 as the Chancellors' designated-hitter. Over the summer, 
however, something clicked in Aude's pituitary gland. He returned for fall 
workouts taller and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"They leave in June and come back different, physically, in the fall," Lofrano 
said. "That's the fun thing about coaching at the the high school level." 
</P>
<P>
This season, playing third base, Aude batted .455 with six home runs and led 
Valley-area City Section players with 39 runs batted in. He also stole 16 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Aude will put those skills on display today in the 13th Bernie Milligan 
All-Star game at Cal State Northridge at 4:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always known I was a good player," Aude said. "I suddenly just came into 
my own this year. I just got faster, my arm got better and I got bigger and 
started to hit." 
</P>
<P>
He also got the opportunity to play every day, something Wolfe had prevented 
before leaving Chatsworth for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Aude also was able to draw on the experience he gained during the off-season 
playing for a Lofrano-run team of Valley-area high school players that 
scrimmaged against college teams. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the confidence building," Lofrano said. "The light goes on 
inside the head of a kid that makes him say, 'I can play with these guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Aude refined his swing into a power stroke with the help of former 
Chatsworth assistant Joe Koh. 
</P>
<P>
"With his long arms and quickness I knew I had something special," said Koh, 
who recently was named head coach at L. A. Baptist High. "But when we first 
started working together he hit like he had half the arm length he has. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked on just getting extended. He's never had a bad swing, it was just a 
case of nurturing it and getting it to a level above everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Eric Johnson, Derek Wallace and Jason Evans were the names 
that came up most often when coaches discussed the Chancellors. Aude's name, 
however, came up first during the draft, and he became the highest Chatsworth 
player ever drafted; Dwight Evans was a fifth-round draft choice of the Boston 
Red Sox in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Aude's only regret is that Chatsworth never got an opportunity to play for the 
City Section 4-A Division title at Dodger Stadium. The Chancellors lost in the 
semifinals three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I had three chances to get to Dodger Stadium and never made it," Aude said. 
</P>
<P>
If Aude and the Pirates come to terms, perhaps he'll get his chance.

L. A. GAMES TO OFFER AN EARLY LOOK AT TOP BASKETBALL SQUADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The high school basketball season may have officially ended with the state 
championships in March. And it does not officially begin again until late 
November. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the area's top schools will preview next season's teams in the Los 
Angeles Games, which begin today at various sites throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
There are 128 teams in the boys' tournament, including Manual Arts, the 1988 
state Division I champion and the City Section 4-A Division runner-up this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland heads the list of Valley-area entries. The Cavaliers will play Santa 
Ana Valley in the opening round at El Camino College in Torrance at 4 this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games, Rio Mesa will play El Camino Real at Banning High 
at noon, Taft will face Western Christian at Dorsey High at 1, and Burroughs 
will play Mission Viejo at El Camino College at 2. 
</P>
<P>
Second- and third-round games in the single-elimination tournament will be held 
Sunday and later rounds will be played next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is one of 12 sports being contested at the L. A. Games. 
</P>
<P>
The others are baseball, seven-man football, track and field, karate, soccer, 
softball, swimming, tennis, water polo, wrestling and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, which defeated Palisades for the City 4-A title in boys' 
volleyball, will compete in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
Other leading local teams include Thousand Oaks, Alemany and North Hollywood in 
girls' basketball; and Canyon and Granada Hills in football. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, the 1989 City girls' soccer champion, is also expected to play.

DOWNHILL RACER; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER SAUGUS FAVORITE DAN PRESS DESCENDS FROM HIS REMOTE MOUNTAINTOP HOME FOR 
A RETURN ENGAGEMENT AS THE SOUTHWEST TOUR LEADER 
</P>

<P>
Far away in the dry mountains of Los Padres National Forest, in the small rural 
town of Lebec, at the end of a long, crudely paved road atop a hill overlooking 
a truck stop with a towering red sign succinctly titled "EAT," Dan Press labors 
like a blacksmith. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a T-shirt and a good bit of grime on his tattooed arms, Press 
supervises both the maintenance of his race car, a 1989 IROC Camaro, and his 
business, Dan Press Development and Machining. 
</P>
<P>
It is a warm afternoon, however, and the boss needs little coaxing to take a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get many visitors up here," Press says as he extends a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen miles farther into the forest, "straight back as the crow flies," 
Press says, lies his home of the past three years. He doesn't see many new 
faces up there, either. 
</P>
<P>
The immaculate state-of-the-art workshop, which produces various metal items, 
including aerospace parts, is a cross between General Motors and Sam Drucker's 
General Store. A wooden facade in the Wild West style gives the mini-mall-sized 
building the look of Main Street in Dodge City. 
</P>
<P>
Six dogs wander lazily, searching for shade in the small freshly paved parking 
lot. Walking through a door usually involves stepping over a sleeping Labrador 
retriever. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a real kennel going here," Press says, ducking into his tiny office. 
The boss settles into the comfortable chair behind his desk, flicks his lighter 
and prepares to sit for a spell while savoring a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of out in the country," Press says, "but we like the atmosphere out 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Press, 40, has both feet up on the coffee table of life. He talks slowly, 
enjoys good conversation and probably chews a mouthful of food 32 times before 
swallowing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite being tucked away 4,000 feet above sea level, a hermit Press is 
not. Once a week or so, he gathers Bonnie, his wife of 21 years, and his small 
entourage, trailers his race car and heads outta them thar hills for the race 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7, Press will visit Saugus Speedway for Race No. 8 in the NASCAR 
All-American Challenge Series Southwest Tour. In his first full season on the 
20-race, 12-track circuit, the reclusive racer, somewhat surprisingly, has 
emerged as the series' points leader. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely in the lower rent district, money-wise," Press says. "But 
we've always been able to do more with less. The top six or eight cars that run 
the tour have just a money's unlimited deal." 
</P>
<P>
In its fourth season, the Southwest Tour, with a total yearly purse of about 
$500,000, has developed into NASCAR's second-most lucrative racing endeavor on 
the West Coast behind the Winston West Series. What began with the grease 
monkey working out of his garage with his own toolbox is rapidly evolving into 
corporate racing. 
</P>
<P>
Several drivers, including defending tour-champion Roman Calczynski of 
Sepulveda, who drives for Spears Manufacturing Co., are employed for their 
driving services by a racing team. Freymiller Trucking Co. and Taco 
Bell/Thompson Buick also field tour competitors. 
</P>
<P>
But with his small-time, small-town operation complete with a seven-member 
volunteer pit crew, Press, who stands 5-feet-6, has emerged as the big man on 
the tour, confounding the big-bucks city slickers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not unique as an owner-operator," NASCAR promoter Owen Kearns Jr. said of 
Press. "But he's doing well with what he has accumulated over the years, both 
in knowledge and pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Burdg, Press' racing partner, considers the pair's effort no more than a 
hobby. "It's a relatively restrictive operation with 100% effort," said Burdg, 
who also owns a machining business in Chatsworth and serves as Press' chief 
sponsor. "What we win goes back into the car. Nobody's in it for the monetary 
gain. He has his job, I have mine and that's that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Press: "Ron and I decided we wanted to give it a run for the championship 
this year. Ron didn't want to do it all on his own. I didn't want to do it all 
on my own. So, we pooled our money and put in whatever it takes to get the job 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Press, a part-time competitor in each of the tour's past three years, has a 
tour-high three wins, five top-five and six top-10 finishes. He is the leading 
money winner with $13,825 entering tonight's 125-lap, 41.6-mile event with a 
total purse of $23,550. Press has completed 629 of the tour's 630 laps. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys don't have any better equipment than what I have," Press said of 
the competition. "They just got more of it. A guy said to me one time years 
ago, 'The money doesn't really make you go any faster, it just makes you go 
faster longer.' " 
</P>
<P>
For many, the success of Press comes as no surprise. And he will be the driver 
to beat tonight for more than one reason. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is winless in six tour appearances at Saugus, Press is the 
winningest, and, arguably, the most popular, driver in the track's 50-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
During his 16-year career at the one-third-mile oval where he was selected 
track rookie of the year in 1973, Press piled up a track-record 61 main-event 
victories while winning Modified division championships in 1978 and '82. His 15 
main-event wins in 1978 remains a track record. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the toughest to beat," said Tru Cheek, a contemporary of Press who won 
Modified titles in 1979 and '81. "He'd win as many as seven or eight races in a 
row sometimes. Him and I fought tooth and nail for years -- on the track, not 
off it." 
</P>
<P>
Press, who describes his career as "up and down," was voted most popular driver 
and "Hard Luck Driver" by the fans three times while developing a reputation 
for rallying and for, well, having hard luck. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be winning and setting track records," Press says, "and then we'd blow up 
five laps later." 
</P>
<P>
He finished second three times, including in 1980 when his points lead slipped 
away after a qualifying-lap crash left him with a broken leg with three races 
left in the season. In 1981, Press broke the same leg and finished outside the 
top 10, but he rebounded to win his second title the following year. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the guys I race with have not been through anything near the chain of 
events that I have gone through in my racing career." Press said. "Most of 
those guys haven't been in real bad accidents." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Press finished second to Ken Sapper of La Crescenta by just 60 points, 
despite a division-high eight main-event wins. In 1985, Press again finished 
out of the top 10 but took the checkered flag of the Miller High Life 150 and 
won three main events. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to do everything myself -- that is the crew and myself," Press said. 
"In '78, when we won the championship, we built our own car, we made our own 
body, we did our own motors. We did everything. Nowadays, it's more practical 
to buy a chassis from somebody and the body parts. All we do now is maintain 
the car, totally, ourselves. We make a few parts for the car, but nothing like 
we used to." 
</P>
<P>
Press concedes that in order to keep pace with the competition he must 
increasingly rely on more modern methods of preparation and maintenance. It is 
a far cry from the old days at Saugus, when he was known as a wizard with a 
wrench. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan has always been an innovator," said Lyn Pherigo, Saugus' publicity 
director. "He's very innovative and very intelligent. He's got the smarts." 
</P>
<P>
Said Press: "I think that where my success comes from is that throughout my 
career, I've liked to experiment. We're not afraid to make drastic changes in 
the car. We have a lot of track experience, a lot of chassis experience. I 
experiment, probably, more than anyone else on the West Coast as far as 
designing stuff and trying stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I always enjoyed about racing. Now it's more of a money sport." 
</P>
<P>
Press admittedly does not race for big bills, but for big thrills. "In our real 
successful years," he said, "we spent, on the average, about $35,000 to $40,000 
in a year and we won anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000. We would win that much 
money just to cut our losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to make a living racing. I make a living here and racing is 
just because I love to race." 
</P>
<P>
Win, lose or slam into a wall tonight, Press will return to his mountain 
retreat and prepare for the following week's race in Madera. It makes for a 
long drive, living a long trek from the nearest track, but Press wouldn't have 
it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it out here," he said. "I had a little trouble sleeping the first 
couple nights because it was so quiet. A guy a block away hits a nail with a 
hammer and you know it."

WEEKEND RACING AT HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
BAYAKOA WILL ATTEMPT TO PULL ANOTHER FAST ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing subtle about Bayakoa. The buck-toothed bay mare knows only one 
way to run -- as fast as she can for as far as she can -- and will be doing it 
again today at Hollywood Park in the $165,500 Milady Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa's freakish speed is becoming legendary. Soon she could be mentioned in 
the same breath as Pink Pigeon, whose exciting style had fans flocking to the 
races in the 1960s, or even Melair, the white comet of three summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the Hawthorne Handicap on May 20, Bayakoa equaled Melair's Silver 
Screen Handicap clocking of 1:32 4/5 for a mile on the main track. In the 
history of thoroughbred racing, they are the only two females to crack the 
magic 1:33 barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, who trains Bayakoa, describes the 5-year-old Argentine mare as 
having "the straight hind leg of a quarter horse and the physical scope of a 
distance horse." The combination has been deadly for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In five starts this season for Nebraska rancher-banker Frank Whitham, Bayakoa 
has been behind another horse only once. That was in January, after she had 
knocked herself dizzy by breaking through the starting gate before the Santa 
Maria Handicap. And she still finished a close second to the accomplished Miss 
Brio. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bayakoa has swept three major races at three different tracks, in 
front every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The only other mare mentioned in the same breath has been Banker's Lady, a 
winner of three stakes in New York this season. But Banker's Lady was beaten 
badly in the Hempstead Handicap last Saturday at Belmont Park, which gives 
Bayakoa the chance to seize the leadership of the national division outright. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa must pay the price for her success and carry 124 pounds in the 1 
1/16-mile Milady. Standing in her way will be four lightly-weighted hopefuls -- 
Carita Tostada, Flying Julia and Behind the Scenes, all soundly beaten by 
Bayakoa already this year, and Hollywood Glitter, a classy mare on the comeback 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo, second to Bayakoa three times this year, was entered for the 
Milady but is not likely to run. Her trainer, Charlie Whittingham, will be 
looking for a race without Bayakoa. 
</P>
<P>
Today's supporting feature at Hollywood Park will be the simulcast of the 
$300,000 Golden Gate Handicap from Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
That 1 3/8-mile turf race will mark the debut of Wayne Gretzky as a 
thoroughbred owner. Last month, King owner Bruce McNall sold Gretzky a piece of 
Frankly Perfect, a major stakes winner who is also trained by Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Gretzky shows up for the race, he would have to share top billing 
with Great Communicator, the defending champion. Great Communicator is fresh 
from a win in the Hollywood Turf Handicap on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator will carry top weight of 125 pounds, compared to 122 on 
Frankly Perfect. The rest of the field includes Pleasant Variety, Dance Card 
Filled, Master Treaty and course specialist Brown Bess, who will be trying to 
beat the boys. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pasakos, once a top colt in France, makes his U.S. stakes debut on Sunday in 
the $109,400 Inglewood Handicap. The high-spirited bay will be challenged by 
defending champion Steinlen, Skip Out Front, Wait Till Monday, Mi Preferido, 
New Colony, Loyal Double and Trokhos. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron will be at Thistledown in Cleveland today, trying to get King 
Glorious back on track in the $300,000 Ohio Derby. Mercedes Won, Halo Hansom 
and Caeser are the only ones given a chance against the California flash, who 
suffered his first defeat last month. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer John Sadler reports that Melair's first foal, by Mr. Prospector, will 
be sold at the select Keeneland auction in July. Melair is back in foal to 
Relaunch, who was almost as gray and almost as fast as Melair in his racing 
days.

DAVE DISTEL: IT ISN'T EXACTLY THE PACIFIC PRINCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I think of cruising on the Pacific, comfortable images come to mind. A 
poolside chaise lounge. Lavish meals served by candlelight. A relaxing hot tub. 
A cabin with daily linen service. Nightly entertainment. Maybe a few stops in 
exotic ports. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Lingenfelder and Mike Casinelli have a slightly different concept of a 
Pacific cruise. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of conveniences, they have none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Casinelli protested. "We eat like kings." 
</P>
<P>
"Once," Lingenfelder added, "we had a candlelight dinner with music." 
</P>
<P>
The music might have been Jimmy Buffett, but the meal was unlike any midnight 
buffet I recall. Eating like kings to them is bran muffins in the morning, 
turkey sandwiches for lunch ad a casserole d'jour for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
To understand these guys, I suppose it is best to examine where they are coming 
from . . . or, more appropriately, where they are going and how they are 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
Lingenfelder and Casinelli depart the San Diego Yacht Club this morning for a 
two-handed sail to Hawaii. That's 2,300 miles, during which the closest port 
will be either the one they left or the one to which they are headed. 
</P>
<P>
If you think these guys are crazy, and well you may, be advised that 10 other 
two-handed yachts will depart with them in what is known as the Race for Life. 
The purpose is to attract attention, financial and otherwise, for the Trauma 
Research and Education Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this race strikes me as a potentially traumatic experience. 
</P>
<P>
But these guys are veterans. This, in fact, is the sixth time they have sailed 
to Hawaii, a journey that will take between 11 and 15 days. Of course, it all 
depends upon the whims of the wind and sea, over which they have absolutely no 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen two races alike," Lingenfelder said. "It's a crazy deal with 
highs and lows. It's always different." 
</P>
<P>
It can be like a Sunday sail off Point Loma, or it can be howling winds and 
crashing waves. A 34-foot boat such as Stinger, which Lingenfelder and 
Casinelli co-own, looks very impressive in a slip at the SDYC, but the ocean 
can be rude enough to treat it like a piece of flotsam. Gale winds can snap 
masts as if they were made of balsa. 
</P>
<P>
"After about two days," Casinelli said, "we look around and wonder what in hell 
we're doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
Because "out there" is there, and these are 50-plus-year-olds who have not lost 
any of the sense of adventure they had when they were lifeguards together in 
Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when Casinelli turned 50, he rode a bicycle from Anacortes, Wash., to 
Camden, Me., a tidy little journey of 4,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Lingenfelder is into tennis, skiing and surfing, in addition to sailing. 
Casinelli is into tennis, body surfing and, obviously, bicycling, in addition 
to sailing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to get into snow skiing," Lingenfelder said. "He just doesn't 
realize it yet." 
</P>
<P>
Even when they are not into something together, it seems they are into the same 
thing. They are both involved in the insurance business and banking. 
</P>
<P>
But now they are into this race, where they will be very together for maybe two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
They set it up so that they take turns at the helm, changing every hour. That's 
12 hours daily for each, and nothing more that fitful naps in between. 
</P>
<P>
"The nights are the worst," Casinelli said. 
</P>
<P>
That figures. There are not too many street lights between San Diego and 
Honolulu. The best they can hope for is a full moon, and they'll get that 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"That," Lingenfelder said, "is a real plus." 
</P>
<P>
In a few hours, they will be alone on the ocean. These boats do not exactly 
sail in a caravan. They see the others at the start and maybe the finish, but 
rarely en route. 
</P>
<P>
And they see airliners. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how we navigate," Casinelli laughed. "We follow the contrails." 
</P>
<P>
Not really, but the airliners provide a touch of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"We look up and think, 'God, it would be nice to be up there with a cocktail 
and a movie,' " Casinelli said, "and there's probably a guy up there looking 
down and thinking, 'God, wouldn't it be nice to be down there sailing with 
those guys?' " 
</P>
<P>
And that guy in the airliner would be right on the mark. Casinelli and 
Lingenfelder are guys who do not seem to be approaching this most daunting of 
journeys with anything more than the relaxed camaraderie of long-time friends. 
If there comes a time to be serious, so be it. They will worry about that then. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we want to win," Lingenfelder said, "but most of all we want to survive 
and have fun doing it." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling to hit the finish line," Casinelli said. "And then the 
party starts." 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, it seems to me there are easier ways to get to a party.

NOMADS WHO WANT TO TRAVEL; 
</P>
<P>
SEVERAL PLAYERS HOPE SOCCER EXPERIENCE LEADS TO U.S. TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call themselves Nomads but are mostly anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the players on San Diego's Western Soccer League team are locals. Few 
nomadic travelers here. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't to say they wouldn't mind doing some globetrotting. In fact, 
defender Arturo Velazco, a La Jolla High graduate, and midfielder Thien Nguyen, 
from Madison, hope to have their itineraries set by the U.S. national team, 
which is fighting for a spot in the 1990 World Cup tournament in Italy and 
which is guaranteed a berth as the host team in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
A third Nomad, Robert Paterson (Mira Mesa High), still has another year to go 
at the University of Evansville before he decides if he wants to play 
internationally, perhaps in Scotland or England. 
</P>
<P>
The decision won't all be up to Paterson. He, Velazco and Nguyen (pronounced 
new-yen) are at the mercy of foreign and U.S. team coaches. What each wants is 
an opportunity, which explains why they toil without pay for the Nomads. 
</P>
<P>
Velazco appears to have the best chance at vaulting into the national scene -- 
and soon. He already has had a one-game tryout with the U.S. team at sweeper 
and is hoping for another at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, despite setting a WSL record with at least one assist in each of the 
Nomads' past six games, is still somewhat invisible to U.S. coaches. This is 
his first experience above the NCAA Division III level. 
</P>
<P>
Paterson scored 15 goals in 16 games last season at Evansville. Many, including 
Nomad Coach Derek Armstrong, thought Paterson could have eclipsed the 
production of Indiana's Ken Snow (who led the nation with 22 goals) if he 
hadn't missed six games with a broken rib and ripped kidney. 
</P>
<P>
Paterson already appears to have made the transition from Division I to the 
WSL. He has scored two goals in each of the Nomads' past two games after being 
switched from the midfield to forward position at halftime of each. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he's trying to tell me something," Armstrong said. "I'll have to start 
listening to him." 
</P>
<P>
What Paterson is saying is that he's a potent scorer. He hopes to lead the 
nation when the college season starts again in September. "I'm hoping for 
around 30 goals," Paterson said. "We'll play a little over 30 games if we go 
all the way (to the NCAA championship game), and one goal per game is what I 
shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
He's been doing twice that with the Nomads since switching to forward. 
</P>
<P>
"He just has good instincts," said Nguyen, the playmaker. "He knows when and 
where to go to an open space." 
</P>
<P>
But Armstrong is not yet convinced Paterson is a complete soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of goals does not make a national player," Armstrong said. "He still 
has to prove himself at that level, and that can only be done by playing where 
we're at now." 
</P>
<P>
Added Nguyen: "Robert is in a sense a good player in that he knows how to score 
goals. He can pick up loose balls and put them in the net. But experience-wise, 
he still has a way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Paterson may never become an international player. In this country, the only 
way to make money is to go indoors and latch on with the Major Indoor Soccer 
League, which may be a realistic goal for Paterson. 
</P>
<P>
"His skills are more suited to the indoor game," Armstrong said. "He's built 
like the Yugoslavian players (who dominate the MISL in scoring). He has those 
heavy thighs like the Yugoslavians." 
</P>
<P>
The MISL, which is expanding to Cleveland and possibly to St. Louis for the 
1989-90 season, may also employ Velazco, though he has failed several tryouts 
with the veteran-rich Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried out for the Sockers so many times, I'm tired of it," Velazco said 
of his four auditions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he has hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling there is going to be a host of clubs chasing after him after 
the (WSL) season," Armstrong said. "We've already got a nibble." 
</P>
<P>
That nibble, Velazco said, came from Kenny Cooper, head coach of the Baltimore 
Blast, which finished first during the regular season before losing to the 
Sockers in the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
But indoor soccer simply represents a safety valve of sorts for Velazco. What 
the 24-year-old defender really wants is a spot on the national team's back 
line. What's holding him back is his current position -- sweeper rather than 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
A sweeper takes on much the same role as does a safety in football. He roves 
the back of the field behind the fullbacks and picks up any forward who shakes 
his defender. A sweeper is usually the biggest player on the field, and 
Velazco, at 5-feet-10, 170 pounds, is rarely that. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I just sweep and not pick up defenders," Velazco said. "I like it, but 
I've been a sweeper for so many years that I just can't get recognized. If 
you're taking care of a forward and no one gets by you, people say, 'Hey, that 
defender's good.' But at sweeper there's no one to keep from getting behind 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Said Armstrong, "I'd love dearly to sign someone to play (sweeper) so I could 
move Arturo up to fullback. I'm sure there isn't anybody better in the country. 
He's so tough the entire 90 minutes. He consistently comes up strong; he's 
fast, and he isn't afraid to tackle. Other players are capable of playing at 
his level, but they can't keep it up for 90 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Velazco, too, may be unable to keep playing for much longer. He has been with 
the Nomads for each of their three previous seasons, earning money by working 
part time for his father's engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It works out well," Velazco said. "He gives me days off on days before games." 
</P>
<P>
Other Nomads haven't had to worry about supporting themselves -- at least not 
yet. They simply use the team to stay in shape for the college season. But that 
will quickly change for Nguyen, who earlier this week graduated from UCSD. For 
the moment, the Nomads will serve Nguyen just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm just telling myself I have one foot through the door," Nguyen 
said. "I want to see how far soccer will carry me. I've talked to some of the 
other players about how to get on the U.S. team, but they just say it's 
impossible to get a tryout unless you have a name for yourself, and this is 
what I'm trying to do with the Nomads." 
</P>
<P>
Although Armstrong also was Nguyen's coach at UCSD, he remained skeptical of 
the midfielder's ability to contribute in the WSL.

"I just didn't know whether Tinney could do it in this league," Armstrong said. 
"And he's still proving himself." 
</P>
<P>
Whether players such as Velazco and Nguyen perform well against WSL 
competition, they still wonder if it will be enough to attract a look from the 
national team coaches. It just might be, judging from recent history. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Marcelo Balboa and goalie Jeff Duback jumped from the Nomads to the 
national team, though both are currently in South Korea with the U.S. under-21 
team for the Presidents' Cup. Also on that team are Nomads Eric Wynalda and 
Anton Nistl, who was called up earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
For those, dreams have become reality. Others still wait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those things," Nguyen said. "Inside I know I can do it . . . 
if I just have the chance." 
</P>
<P>
The Nomads (7-1) will be out to maintain their WSL-leading pace at 7:30 tonight 
in Balboa Stadium, where they play host to the defending champion Seattle Storm 
(5-2) and bring back several familiar faces. 
</P>
<P>
Sockers Paul Wright and Rene Ortiz, fresh from the MISL championship series 
victory over Baltimore, will join the Nomads for tonight's game along with 
backup goalkeeper Otto Orf and former Socker George Katakalidas. 
</P>
<P>
Orf was the key addition after the U.S. Soccer Federation took Nistl this week.

TIMING, PURSE WILL LIMIT STAR QUALITY OF TRIATHLON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of the San Diego International Triathlon wish their international 
event had one particular entrant with a U.S. passport. 
</P>
<P>
When the gun goes off Sunday at 7 a.m. at Spanish Landing, defending men's pro 
champion Scott Tinley of Del Mar will be missing. 
</P>
<P>
Tinley received a generous fee -- far exceeding the $1,500 the winner here will 
earn -- to compete in this weekend's Nihondaira Triathlon, a stop on the Japan 
Triathlon Series. 
</P>
<P>
"And we almost lost Paula (Newby-Fraser)," race spokesman Stephanie Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Newby-Fraser, the defending women's champion and course record-holder from 
Encinitas, also planned on racing in Japan this weekend, but sponsor 
commitments kept her here. 
</P>
<P>
Conflicting events kept the biggest names from competing in the independently 
run San Diego triathlon. It comes between qualifying races for the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Also keeping the event from star attraction was lack of sponsorship. With the 
San Diego Port District offering the only major funding, last year's prizes of 
$10,000 each for the top men's and women's pro finishers couldn't be 
duplicated. This year's total purse is $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was more money, there would be a lot more pros," Newby-Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a near capacity turnout -- close to 1,000, with 25 men and women entered 
in the pro division -- is expected, with up-and-coming pros rather than 
established big names to generate excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"The men's race should be good, because lots of good men train here in San 
Diego," said Newby-Fraser, regarded as the most consistent woman in the sport 
today. She set the course record of 1:37.16 last year and is Sunday's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Newby-Fraser said Shannon Delaney of Del Mar, Janet Stamper of Tucson, Ariz., 
and Nancy Vallance of Santa Barbara should challenge her. 
</P>
<P>
Going after Tinley's course record of 1:24:42 (set last year) are Brad Kearns 
of Malibu, the winner here in 1987, Emilio de Soto and Mark Montgomery, both of 
Encinitas, and Mark Pringle and Glenn Forbes, both of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
De Soto recently finished second to Tinley at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center Triathlon. Montgomery won here four years ago.

DEEP BUDGET CUTS PROPOSED TO PAY FOR MORE POLICE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Manager John Lockwood on Friday offered a list of deep, 
wide-ranging cuts in next year's city budget, proposing to eliminate an 
after-school recreation program and the city attorney's consumer fraud unit as 
part of an effort to put 140 new police officers on the streets by the fall of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's proposal would cut $21.8 million from an array of programs over the 
next two fiscal years, eliminating 75 to 100 jobs from the 8,695-member city 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some layoffs," Lockwood said in an interview. "We won't be able 
to accommodate everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood has separately proposed $14.9 million in reductions in capital 
improvement projects to fund construction of two police substations also 
desired by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret Allocation 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Lockwood prepared major budget cuts, the council voted secretly 
Monday to increase City Atty. John Witt's budget next year by $1.96 million to 
pay for attorneys and consultants in the city's battle to thwart the merger of 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, The Times has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly $1 million of the money will be spent to pay the private 
Washington-based attorneys hired to stop the merger. 
</P>
<P>
In a closed session, the council agreed to spend hotel tax funds, currently 
earmarked for construction of a pedestrian bridge over Harbor Drive in the next 
decade, on the attorneys and expert witnesses, according to Witt and Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
Witt said information about the vote was to be made public shortly, but he did 
not know exactly when. Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson has previously defended 
secrecy about the exact amounts of such expenditures on the grounds that public 
disclosure would harm the city's legal strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's budget proposals are the outcome of a unanimous May 25 vote by the 
council ordering him to find the money in the fiscal 1990 budget for 140 new 
police officers and substations in Southeast San Diego and Mid-City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'State of Emergency' 
</P>
<P>
The funds also would pay for 47 support personnel such as dispatchers, auto 
mechanics, personnel managers and payroll employees. 
</P>
<P>
That directive came two days after the council, led by Mayor Maureen O'Connor, 
declared that drug- and gang-related shootings had created a "state of 
emergency" and asked Gov. George Deukmejian for a $34-million grant to help 
quell the violence. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted in their entirety by the council -- a highly unlikely prospect -- 
Lockwood's proposals would touch a host of city programs that directly affect 
many citizens. For example, he is suggesting complete elimination of the 
$198,000 program under which the city inspects privately owned canyon-rim 
property for brush that could create a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The manager also would remove $1 million over the next two fiscal years from 
the 44 social service programs now receiving city money. Decisions on which 
programs would be specifically affected will be made later, said Ross McCollum, 
director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of the consumer fraud prosecutors would save $532,000, but Witt 
said he will fight the move when it comes before the council. 
</P>
<P>
In the Park and Recreation Department, Lockwood suggests reducing a senior 
citizen program by one-third to save $56,000, halving a disabled-services 
program to recoup $128,000 and completely eliminating after-school playground 
programs by cutting the remaining $481,000 that he had intended to leave in the 
budget. Lockwood's original $931-million spending blueprint already included a 
$577,000 proposed cut in after-school recreation. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, an ardent backer of after-school recreation, proposed Thursday to 
rescue the program by paying for it with profits from her three-week Soviet art 
festival scheduled for this October. Lockwood said Friday that he is confident 
the profits will be available. 
</P>
<P>
He said that service levels in the Park and Recreation Department will be lower 
than they were 30 years ago if his cuts are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's proposal offers no specifics on the possibility of increasing 
revenue by demanding early repayment of loans advanced to the Centre City 
Development Corp., the city's redevelopment arm, a prospect raised at 
Thursday's budget session. The CCDC is scheduled to meet Monday to determine 
how much money is available. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's budget does show, however, that the council could raid a fund set 
aside for extension of the city's trolley system, by allocating $3 million 
toward the substations. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members differed with some of the suggested reductions, they 
remained committed to the goal of adding 140 police officers, or about that 
many, to the force. The officers would be added to the force over a 16-month 
period beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the magnitude of the cuts, O'Connor "is committed to public safety and 
increasing the number of officers on the street, and getting new substations," 
said Paul Downey, her spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner, who has repeatedly called for more police, said he will 
again suggest a tax increase to fund the initiative. He said cuts in social 
services, park and recreation employees and city attorneys may actually 
decrease the city's level of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the cuts are painful and cut into the public safety, if you define 
that broadly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members reiterated their support for a substation near the 
high-crime intersection of 29th Street and Imperial Avenue, some were wavering 
about funding a second one in Mid-City. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts said he was encouraged by Lockwood's idea of building 
the Southeast San Diego substation with "modular buildings" for $3.6 million, 
instead of $6 million, and might be persuaded to abandon the second substation 
rather than "ripping the heart out of the park program." 
</P>
<P>
Under Lockwood's proposals, the substation spending would require more than 
$6.4 million in reductions for park and recreation improvements to Mission Bay 
Park and other city parks over three fiscal years.

ASTRONAUT RIDE TO PURSUE DUAL INTERESTS AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casting about for a new career challenge, Sally K. Ride, the first U.S. woman 
astronaut, said she sought to pursue two interests: teaching and the space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Ride, who is winding up a two-year-stint as a fellow at Stanford 
University's prestigious Center for International Security and Arms Control, 
has found such a dual role at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, UC San Diego announced that Ride has been appointed a professor of 
physics at the university, and that she will serve as director of the 
California Space Institute, part of the university's Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography. Her time will be divided between the two responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Space, as it is known, coordinates space-related research at all eight 
general campuses in the University of California system. It also serves as a 
liaison with the state aerospace industry in developing new technologies and 
their applications. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, whose appointment becomes effective July 1 and who is already slated to 
teach undergraduate physics classes in the fall, said the joint positions 
dovetailed in singular fashion with her career plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Package 'Very Attractive' 
</P>
<P>
"This will allow me to pursue my interest in physics and in the space program," 
Ride said Friday in a brief telephone interview from Stanford. "The package of 
those two was very attractive. . . . It's a good opportunity for development." 
</P>
<P>
Ride, who participated in two space shuttle missions in 1983-84, also served on 
the presidential commission that investigated the fatal explosion in 1986 
aboard the space shuttle Challenger, and later directed a National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration panel on the future of the space program. She stepped 
down from NASA in 1987 to assume the position at Stanford. She remains one of 
the nation's best-known ex-astronauts, although she has shunned interviews and 
is said to have not enjoyed the public exposure that accompanied her position 
as the first U.S. woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
Ride expressed her view that the shuttle program was developing very well since 
the Challenger accident, and that NASA was "paying an appropriate amount of 
attention to safety." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Outpost on Moon 
</P>
<P>
She reiterated her well-known interest in establishing a permanent research 
outpost on the moon, and urged Congress, the Bush Administration and NASA to 
coordinate a long-term plan for space exploration. "If it's not developed," she 
said, "the space program will be fragmented." 
</P>
<P>
Space policy debates in Washington currently focus on a number of potential 
avenues, including whether to fund a manned space station, an expedition to 
Mars, or both. 
</P>
<P>
At UC San Diego, there was a sense that Ride's arrival was a coup. The former 
astronaut said she had been in touch with several universities in recent 
months, but the San Diego offer was the "most appealing." She is to be paid a 
full professor's salary of $64,000, plus a $6,000 stipend as the Cal Space 
director, a university spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sally was sort of a natural for this," said Edward A. Frieman, director of the 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography, which is part of the UC San Diego campus. 
"Clearly, Sally has immense experience in areas that relate to this (space), 
and impinge on it." 
</P>
<P>
Added UC San Diego Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson: "I can think of no one 
better suited to lead Cal Space into the next decade and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Ride said it was premature to say in what direction she hoped to guide the Cal 
Space institute, which was created by the California Legislature in 1979. The 
idea was to coordinate disparate space research throughout the system. Cal 
Space has a budget of $3.3 million, including university funds and grants, and 
employs 28 full- and part-time staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Ride did express a clear interest in expanding satellite remote sensing of the 
Earth, a growing field in which space images are used to study a wide range of 
environmental phenomena, from global warming to the destruction of rain 
forests. Scripps is already heavily involved in such monitoring, and is 
expecting to conduct even more related research. 
</P>
<P>
Other fields of research coordinated by Cal Space include climatology, space 
resources, propulsion and robotics. Specific research projects include cloud 
effects on radiative energy, marine production, advanced propulsion systems and 
El Nino, the Pacific current that affects fisheries and climate. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, 38, who is single and a native of Encino, holds master's and doctorate 
degrees in physics from Stanford, as well as an undergraduate diploma from the 
same university. University of California regents approved her appointment at 
UC San Diego this week. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Space, she will replace James Arnold, the founding director, who is 
stepping down to devote full time to teaching and research.

DEL MAR FAIR THEME MAY SHED SOME LIGHT ON AN AGE-OLD FOWL QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The roosters heard crowing Friday at the main entrance to the Del Mar Fair were 
more than appropriate for Opening Day. After all, the theme of the fair is a 
tribute to the poultry and egg industry -- "Get crackin' . . . It's all for 
you!" 
</P>
<P>
But not even these perky poultry products could shed light on the day's most 
puzzling question: What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the fair seemed like the right place to go for an answer. Once 
through the entrance and past the stroller rentals to the right, a wall of 
"Eggformation" -- facts about the San Diego County poultry industry -- offered 
some hope. 
</P>
<P>
A close look revealed such statistics as the number of hens in the county (4.7 
million) and the amount of eggs each one lays a year (274). But nowhere was 
there a clue about which came first. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Hesitant 
</P>
<P>
Even fair officials were hesitant to hazard a guess. A "cosmic clue," though, 
might be in the setup of the poultry exhibits, a fair spokesman said. The first 
exhibit encountered is a hatchery. Chicks can be seen hatching from eggs kept 
under a heat lamp. Other livestock exhibits offer a look at everything from 
fancy pigeons to llamas to miniature horses. 
</P>
<P>
The fair, which runs through July 4, also features a "Fun Zone" of two roller 
coasters, a water ride and a giant Ferris wheel; a garden and flower show; 
nearly 600 product concessions; and seven stages for music, dancing and 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
For those who favor the livestock exhibits, a short distance from the poultry 
hatchery, older chicks peck here and there at the probing fingers of children. 
The smell in the barn exhibits might have daunted a few, but sounds and 
behavior of the animals amused most. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blow-Dried Sheep 
</P>
<P>
Outside the sheep exhibits, a few sheep were being blow-dried. The sheep had 
been showered and their hair was being fluffed up in preparation for shearing. 
One of them apparently looked cute enough to kiss, which a woman did on the 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
In another barn, "Samantha," a female limousin beef cow, wasn't as 
accommodating. "Just when people say how nice she looks, she starts acting up," 
said handler Melissa Veik. The cow was aggressively trying to get loose from 
her tether on a post in the barn. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Denman, 7, prefers to brave some of the fair's scariest rides. Enticed by 
the exhortations of a disc jockey at the "Orbiter" -- a whirring ride 
accompanied by blaring music -- he eagerly stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's chicken time," the disc jockey challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Eric's cousin Alexandra, 7, wasn't about to accept. Alexandra wanted to head 
over to the water slide. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a scaredy-cat," said her mother, Sarah. "She's a cautious kid. Her 
father says it's a sign of intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eric Was Turned Loose 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes of spinning around and around in a small cubicle at a 
frightening speed, Eric was turned loose, sort of. He climbed out of the 
compartment "a little dizzy" and forgot where the ride's exit was. So, he left 
the way he came in -- the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," he said, ready to try another ride. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Thompson, 3, and her brother, Jason, 6, had feather designs painted on 
their faces while waiting for business at the rides to pick up a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say anything to grandma and grandpa when you see them and see what they 
say," said their mother, Sheryl. She has visited the fair the past 14 years and 
said she would bring her children again later in the fair's run when the kids' 
competitions are held. 
</P>
<P>
The squeals of delight from Michael Provder, 6, were directed toward "Eggbert," 
a walking California Fresh Egg. Michael tugged at his grandfather's arm to go 
and meet the egg. "Eggbert" was dressed, of course, in California attire -- 
brightly colored surfer shorts, visor and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Perfect Source to Answer Question 
</P>
<P>
Here, at last, seemed the perfect source to answer the eternal poultry 
question: The chicken or the egg? 
</P>
<P>
Via an interpreter, his answer: "The egg, of course." 
</P>
<P>
The fair is open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. The exhibits are open from 10 a.m. to 
10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Fridays and

Two men deported to Mexico a year ago for drug-trafficking violations will face 
preliminary hearings next week on suspicion of burglarizing as many as 42 homes 
in Solana Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were picked up in the past two weeks by investigators, who believe 
witness identifications and fingerprints taken from about half of the burglary 
scenes prove they are responsible for a string of mainly daytime thefts in a 
quiet residential community, sheriff's detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
A third Mexican national also is being sought in connection with the 
burglaries, said Detective Larry Van Wey of the Sheriff's Department in 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
The burglaries may have netted as much as $40,000 in stolen property and cash, 
and probably were used to support the alleged drug habits of the men, Van Wey 
said. They took place in an area north of Lomas Santa Fe Drive on Dell Street 
and Granados and Nardo avenues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the property or cash, which may have been sold or traded quickly to 
finance drug buys, has been recovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burglarized Before 
</P>
<P>
Genaro Vences Lopez, 18, was arrested on June 2 by Deputy Richard Escamilla, 
who caught him after plainclothes detectives saw the man removing a window 
screen from a house in the 500 block of Lomas Santa Fe. Investigators believe 
the house had been burglarized once before by the men. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez also was identified by witnesses as the person who was seen on May 30 
trying to break into a house on South Nardo Avenue, Van Wey said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, deported last year as a juvenile for drug trafficking, faces 11 counts 
of burglary and one count of attempted burglary. Bail has been set at $200,000, 
and his preliminary hearing is on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Silovar Osorio, 19, was arrested by Deputy Roy Heringer on June 8 on 
suspicion of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Later, 
investigators linked his fingerprints to two of the burglaries, Van Wey said. 
</P>
<P>
Osorio, deported on a suspended three-year sentence for drug trafficking, faces 
2 counts of burglary and is being held on $10,000 bail. His preliminary hearing 
is set for June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Osorio also could face charges by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of 
felony re-entry for returning to the United States, Van Wey said. 
</P>
<P>
The string of break-ins started at the end of April, and the burglaries were 
marked by similar features, the detective said. Most occurred in the same area 
during the daytime, entry was gained through a forced window and similar 
property was stolen in each incident. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe at least one house in the area was robbed twice by the 
men, and in some cases, the residents were in their homes when the men broke 
in, Van Wey said. 
</P>
<P>
Osorio allegedly ate half of a pineapple upside-down cake while burglarizing 
one home, he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's Roman Catholic leader, Bishop Leo T. Maher, condemned Friday the 
San Diego Police Department policy "of inflicting pain upon nonviolent 
protesters," such as the use of nunchakus to subdue anti-abortion protesters 
"who may transgress the civil law when demonstrating against unjust laws." 
</P>
<P>
The bishop sent his denouncement of police use of force against members of 
Project Rescue to pastors of parishes in the city of San Diego. His message 
will be read at masses this weekend. He told the Catholic pastors to ask their 
congregations to write letters of protest to the San Diego police chief and 
city manager about the police practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all obligated to reverse the unjust laws that allow abortion clinics to 
kill innocent unborn babies," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"While we cannot condone the violation of civil law, we can condemn the 
proposed use of the painful and cruel techniques of nunchakus by our Police 
Department," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
"Torture in the name of 'crowd control' has no place in our society. The 
precious rights of assembly and free speech should not be endangered."

PACOIMA GROUP NOTCHES ANOTHER VICTORY OVER LIQUOR STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles zoning official on Friday rejected a Pacoima gas station's 
request to sell beer and wine, another victory for residents fighting to reduce 
liquor sales in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people urged Zoning Administrator Jon Perica to deny the 
application for the Arco gas station at 13570 Van Nuys Boulevard. Residents say 
that stretch of the thoroughfare has too many liquor stores and bars. 
</P>
<P>
They were joined by representatives of Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and 
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, along with a Los Angeles police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting owner Sion Sasoones' application, Perica cited police reports that 
the area has a high number of drunk-driving arrests. He agreed with residents 
that the neighborhood is saturated with liquor businesses -- eight stores and 
four bars in a two-block area. 
</P>
<P>
Sasoones' representative said that because of the community opposition, he will 
advise his client not to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing at the Van Nuys Woman's Club showed the growing effectiveness of a 
residents group in reducing the concentration of liquor stores and bars in 
Pacoima. Residents blame the stores and bars for crime, drunk driving and 
loitering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Refused 
</P>
<P>
On May 30, the Los Angeles City Council refused an appeal by another Pacoima 
gas station owner to sell liquor. The same day, a city zoning board imposed 
strict operating restrictions on three liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to get good at this," said Fred Taylor of the Pacoima 
Coordinating Council. "It's time people start looking at what this community is 
saying." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the community opposition, Sasoones had offered to sell only 
nonrefrigerated beer and wine and to stop liquor sales at 10 p.m. But Perica 
said the area's problems are too serious to permit new sales. 
</P>
<P>
Perica had denied a liquor permit for Sasoones 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Al Pratt, Sasoones' representative, said he understood the community's 
frustration. But he argued that his client would suffer economically because of 
the residents' opposition to all liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the mentality right now," Pratt said. "I applaud the efforts of the 
groups that have to live with the turmoil, but each case should be evaluated on 
an individual basis. He runs a good business. Why not give him a license and 
pull other licenses that are being abused?" 
</P>
<P>
Perica praised community leaders for a well-organized presentation. Bernardi 
said later that residents support crackdowns on existing merchants in addition 
to banning new requests to sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole community is up in arms," Bernardi said. "Getting a new liquor 
license in that area is going to be pretty tough. If someone does get a liquor 
license, there will be some very severe limitations on what kind of business 
they can do." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and other residents said owners of formerly notorious liquor stores in 
the area are now cooperating with residents by setting up security patrols, 
cracking down on loitering and painting over gang graffiti.

PHOENIX HOUSE ASKS EXTENSION ON HEARING; FOES SCRAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization that three weeks ago abandoned plans to put a drug-treatment 
center in Lake View Terrace has asked for a month's extension of the time 
before a city hearing on the project, suggesting to opponents that it may still 
be alive. 
</P>
<P>
In Lake View Terrace, opponents of the Nancy Reagan Center reacted with alarm 
Friday to news of the request by Phoenix House, which will be heard Tuesday by 
the city Board of Zoning Appeals. They said it could mean that, like the 
mythical phoenix, plans for the center are rising from their ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception community people will have, whether it's true or not, is that 
they've changed their minds and will be continuing with the site," said Lewis 
Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A Phoenix House vice president insisted Friday that the New York-based 
organization has not changed its mind about relinquishing its option to buy the 
former Lake View Medical Center, which had filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
It dropped the plan to convert the hospital into a 210-bed treatment and 
research center after ex-First Lady Nancy Reagan withdrew her support, citing 
community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Analyze Legal Obligations' 
</P>
<P>
Larraine Mohr, Phoenix House vice president, said when asked about the 
postponement request: "We need time to verify and analyze what our legal 
obligations are with respect to the application on that site." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, still officially scheduled, is on a zoning administrator's ruling 
in favor of Phoenix House. 
</P>
<P>
Mohr said attorneys and Phoenix House officials need to review obligations 
related to fund-raising for the center, which brought in at least $5 million 
from several celebrity-studded events. 
</P>
<P>
A Phoenix House spokesman said the group hoped to find another Los Angeles 
location acceptable to Reagan where the money could be used instead. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of Reagan's announcement, Phoenix House notified the bankruptcy 
court-appointed trustee of its intent to cancel the option, for which it has 
paid more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Here We Go Again' 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Barry, recording secretary for the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., 
spent Friday afternoon notifying association members about Tuesday's extension 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been calling a lot of people and they've all said, 'Oh, my God, here we 
go again,' " Barry said. "We're all just so tired of dealing with this." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors say the center would attract drugs and crime and lower their property 
values. They were so pleased with Reagan's announcement that they held two 
large victory parties.

TV SHOW LEADS TO ARREST OF MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A June 4 segment of a television show, "America's Most Wanted," is credited 
with leading to the arrest of a former professional boxer from Los Angeles on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mauricio Aldana Acosta, 34, was arrested in Tijuana after a manhunt by law 
enforcement agencies on both sides of the border. Acosta is wanted in 
connection with the murder of Martin Arguello Trujillo in Los Angeles on Jan. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
The television show dramatized the story of Acosta, known to fight fans as "El 
Gato," who was a light-middleweight contender in the early 1980s before he 
began using drugs and losing fights. Acosta and Trujillo had argued the night 
Trujillo was killed with three shots from a .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hughes, special agent in charge of the San Diego FBI office, said a 
number of viewers called the FBI and San Diego Police Department with 
information about Acosta's whereabouts after the show. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican state judicial police arrested Acosta about 11 p.m. Thursday at an 
apartment in Tijuana. He will be held for trial in Mexico because he is a 
Mexican citizen.

OBJECTIONS TO BURBANK AIRPORT POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our club consists of 856 members. Most of the members live in the East Valley 
with their families. We object to the jet noise from the heavy air traffic at 
the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that your survey of 710 people, mostly from the three cities that 
own the airport, is erroneous and misleading. Not one of our members was 
polled. And we are 856 individuals plus our spouses and children and 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
We are the so-called "silent majority," with no political clout over the 
Burbank Airport Authority. Your article of May 28 is absolutely incorrect to 
assume that only a very small percentage of people oppose a new airport 
terminal. We all do oppose the expansion. We all are annoyed by the hellish jet 
noise.

WHO'S IN MAINSTREAM ON PORTER RANCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Hal Bernson's use of a document by one individual opposing the 
proposed Porter Ranch development to brand the legitimate opposition to that 
project as outside the political mainstream is unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
For an elected official to use the admittedly somewhat overstated words of a 
single individual to ridicule the legitimate concerns of the people he is 
supposed to represent is truly unacceptable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether it is "outside the mainstream" to not want to see badly planned 
development run rampant in this area, already beginning to suffer the effects 
of overcrowding, I wholeheartedly disagree. When the people who live in this 
areas become aware of the fact that our elected officials are trying to turn 
the Simi Valley Freeway into a traffic-choked "Ventura Freeway II" by promoting 
the same kind of helter-skelter building that has gone on in that area, Mr. 
Bernson will find himself not only out of the mainstream, but high and dry.

PROFITABILITY SHOULD DETERMINE LAND-USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter M. McIntyre (Letters, May 27) advocates a moratorium to stop the owner 
of the land under the Unocal service station and Tiny Naylor's restaurant at 
Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards from developing the site as the owner sees 
fit. I find that his position is self-contradictory and politically dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre's viewpoint is self-contradictory in that he asserts the thesis that 
the developers are swamping our neighborhoods motivated by "greed" and the 
desire for profits, and that at the same time these developers are excluding 
from their consideration the "wants of the community and existing market 
forces," and "the needs of its consumers." 
</P>
<P>
The only way that the desires of consumers are made objectively knowable is 
through the market process of profit and loss. Those entrepreneurs who 
correctly estimate the future desires of consumers are the ones who can acquire 
profits. The entrepreneurs who fail to forecast accurately the wants of 
consumers sustain losses. Developers do not build houses and shopping malls for 
their own amusement. They do it out of the desire for profits. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the consumers who are willing to exchange their money with these 
developers to buy or rent what the developers produce. If the consumers do not 
want what the developers are offering, then these same developers will sustain 
losses. Thus the idea of a free-market acquisition of profits and an utter 
neglect of the wants of consumers is a self-contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. McIntyre somehow knows that the present use of the land at Ventura 
Boulevard and Laurel Canyon is "supported by the community and meets the needs 
of its consumers." But the "community" does not speak with one voice, and the 
only way the set of individuals who make up the community can make their 
preferences known is by way of the market (i.e., profit and loss). If indeed 
the development of the corner site into a "retail complex" is more profitable 
than leaving it as a gas station and restaurant, then Mr. McIntyre is in fact 
substituting his personal preferences over that of his neighbors. The only way 
he can act on his preferences is by calling on the coercive powers of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
I call upon City Councilman Joel Wachs to reject the pleas of Mr. McIntyre. I 
ask him to oppose the idea of a moratorium on the basis of the economic facts, 
as well as on the basis of the owner's inalienable right to peacefully use his 
property as he determines.

DOW UP 11.38; INDEX TRADING SWELLS VOLUME

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market moved ahead Friday in the heaviest trading volume in about 
five months as buyers braved the "triple witching hour." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 11.38 to 2,486.38 but lost 27.04 
points from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 244.51 million shares, up from 
179.48 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually heavy volume on Wall Street reflected trades associated with the 
expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual 
stocks. The set of expirations occurs once each quarter in something commonly 
called the triple witching hour. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trading was concentrated around the opening and closing of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Traders paid little attention to two government economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Communications dominated the list of actively traded NYSE-listed stocks 
on news that Time intends to launch a $70-a-share tender offer for Warner 
instead of merging with Warner in a stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
More than 8.2 million Warner shares changed hands in NYSE-composite trading, 
and the stock wound up with a gain of 3 5/8 at 59 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Time, which also said it has rejected a $175-a-share takeover bid from 
Paramount Communications, tumbled 9 to 162 1/2. Paramount pulled back by 1 3/8 
to 58 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Another media stock, MCA, gained 1 1/4 to 60 in response to a Business Week 
magazine report that the company may be a takeover candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer tumbled in heavy trading on news that the personal computer 
group has had difficulty producing enough of its popular new Macintosh IICX 
computers to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Apple finished down 3 at 44 1/2 after recovering from a session low of 43 1/2. 
It was the second most active over-the-counter stock Friday, with more than 4.8 
million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak shed 1/8 to 48 5/8. The company said it is consolidating some 
operations that would cause hundreds of job cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A. H. Robins rose 3 1/8 to 29 7/8. A federal court approved Robins' bankruptcy 
reorganization plan, which includes $2.5 billion for women who claim they were 
injured by the company's Dalkon Shield birth control device sold widely in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stock prices gained moderately to end the week on an up note after 
Thursday's huge drop. The Nikkei 225-share index gained 142.08 points to close 
at 33,055.17. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
A rally in the dollar fizzled one day after a sharp selloff, leaving it higher 
against the British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc but lower against 
other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose from late Thursday levels in Asian and early European trading 
despite central banks' dollar sales, but it failed to hold ground after a U.S. 
report showed inflation in May at the high end of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5340 to buy 
one pound, more than $1.5195 late Thursday. In New York, the pound fell to 
$1.5410 from $1.5510 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell 6.25 Japanese yen to a closing 145.05 yen in Tokyo. Later, in 
London, it was quoted at 145.50 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 144.70 yen 
from 145.40. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices edged lower following the government's report that consumer prices 
rose sharply in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped 3/16 point, or $1.87 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from price, was unchanged from late Thursday at 8.30%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for short-term 
loans, was quoted late Friday at 9.438%, unchanged from late Thursday.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: LONG-DISTANCE RENTAL PLAN IS RISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am 35 years old with a wife and two young children. I earn $77,000 
annually and own a house and an investment condominium in Southern California. 
I have a career-enhancing opportunity that will require my relocating to the 
Midwest for about five years. I am wondering what I should do with my house. 
I'd like to rent it out while we are away. 
</P>
<P>
Even though my monthly mortgage is about $500 more than I could get in rent, I 
want to keep the house because I feel it has much appreciation potential. I 
could still buy a house in the Midwest by either selling the condo, which is 
not appreciating much, or some stock, which also don't show much appreciation 
potential. What do your advisers suggest? -- E. S. K. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Our advisers expressed some skepticism about your plan. Do you really 
think you can adequately manage a rental property, particularly one that was 
your own house, from a distance of 2,000 miles? Can you really afford to 
subsidize your renters to the tune of $500 per month? If so, proceed. If not, 
you should rethink your plan before you do anything you might later regret. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that you do decide to convert your home into a rental, how will you 
finance the purchase of a house in the Midwest? Thomas Gau, a financial planner 
with Kavish &amp; Gau in Torrance, thinks that you should probably sell the 
stock to raise the money for the down payment. He reasons that if the stock 
hasn't appreciated much, then you probably won't owe much tax on it and you can 
apply the proceeds toward the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you sell the condo, you could face tax on the appreciated 
value, leaving you with less to put toward the down payment on the house. He 
also notes that the depreciation on the condo affords you a tax deduction you 
may not want to give up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy on Retirement Plan Payout Is Good 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our company is dropping its retirement plan, and I will shortly be receiving 
a distribution of about $50,000. I want to use about $10,000 of the amount to 
pay off some personal debts and reinvest the remainder in some sort of a 
tax-sheltered retirement account. 
</P>
<P>
However, my accountant told me that if I spend the $10,000 before I re-invest 
the remaining $40,000, I will be subject to income taxes on the entire $50,000. 
She said I must first invest the $50,000 and then pull out $10,000 the 
following year, at which time I will be subject to taxation on just the 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
This all sounds pretty strange to me. Can you make any sense of it? -- D. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: What your accountant told you used to be true. But the law has changed, and 
essentially the strategy you originally intended to use is now permitted 
without dire tax consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The law governing retirement plan distributions allows a taxpayer to take a 
partial personal disbursement and roll over the remaining funds into a 
tax-deferred retirement account. Of course, you will be taxed on whatever 
amount you withdraw for your personal use.

WHEN TWO MEN DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 10-year member of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, I would like to 
thank Terry McQuilkin for his June 12 review of our 10th-anniversary concert. 
</P>
<P>
We have worked toward mainstream recognition as a legitimate musical ensemble, 
capable of doing Stravinsky "straight" as well as campy theatrics for our own 
community audience, and McQuilkin clearly recognized that this program was 
designed to represent both aspects. 
</P>
<P>
However, I contend that his description of our dancers as being "sexually 
explicit" is misleading to potential concert-goers, and probably would not have 
been applied to a male-female duo performing the same actions. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison to recent Music Center Opera productions -- including 
helium-heeled nuns in "The Fiery Angel," Maria Ewing's G-string-less "Salome" 
and quite explicit sex in "Wozzeck" (the latter two activities are definitely 
not in the original scripts) -- I think that suggestive is the strongest term 
one could apply to a balletic dance involving extensive affectionate body 
contact between two men (who engaged in no sort of disrobing or pelvic 
thrusts). Unless, of course, the reviewer was a nervous heterosexual who didn't 
want to be reminded that such things go on in the real world and that he 
happened to be in the minority in this particular audience.

WHEN TWO MEN DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would appear that Mr. McQuilkin has never seen the dance "Light Rain," 
performed often at the Los Angeles Music Center by the Joffrey Ballet Company. 
This highly acclaimed dance is in every way as sexually explicit as the dance 
performed at "Ten! A Decade of Song." 
</P>
<P>
The one difference, of course, is that the dance was performed by two 
(beautiful) men. 
</P>
<P>
If the explicit showing of sexual attraction between two men is the basis of 
his assessment that the dance "exceeded the bounds of good taste," then perhaps 
Mr. McQuilkin should review his own attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
If that is not the case, then perhaps he should attend a performance of "Light 
Rain" and re-evaluate his perception of the bounds of good taste in light of 
its artistic sentiment.

NOT AMUSED BY CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year I saw Andrew Dice Clay at a comedy club in New York. I'm no 
prude, yet I was unprepared for Clay's routine, 40 of the longest and most 
upsetting minutes I've experienced. 
</P>
<P>
His act sickened me not simply because of the grossness of obscenities, the 
misogyny or the homophobia (unfortunately, Clay isn't the only regular female- 
and gay-bashing performer). No, Clay was frightening to see because of the 
hatred that lay behind every vulgarity. His claim, "Hey, I make funna 
everybody," somehow made it acceptable for him to vilify blacks, Latinos, 
Asians, homosexuals, women -- and I'm sure I've overlooked a few. Clay did not. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't surprise me that Lawrence Christon describes the crowd at Clay's 
show as "amazingly charged" ("The Feat of Clay: A Tough Guy's Stand-Up 
Comedian," June 3). So, I would imagine, were the Nazis when listening to 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Clay is acceptable and popular is sad. The fact that a reviewer 
would consider his act only "amiable goofin' on a very low level" is 
disturbing. But the fact that Clay plays to a sold-out house at the Universal 
Amphitheatre is somehow the most horrifying of all.

LES MORMONS AND MYTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several letters in the June 10 Calendar section denounce the act Les Mormons. 
Unlike those writers, I have seen the funny and enlightening burlesque-style 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Letter writer John Arnerich, who said that Les Mormons are attacking prejudice 
with prejudice, should be informed that they attack prejudice only with a call 
for change in myths long overdue for an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
The Les Mormons duo -- Curtis York and Robert Daniels -- are men ahead of their 
time, guilty only of assailing the isolation and confusion associated with 
church-supported bigotry.

'NAPOLEON' SCREENINGS

I was somewhat disappointed in your May 30 Morning Report item on Frances 
Coppola and the film "Napoleon." (A feature of this film is my musical score, 
which I conduct.) "Napoleon" is not being brought "out of exile," as your 
article says, but has been going strong in major cities as recently as six 
months ago -- in Hanover, Valencia, Madrid, etc.

PREVIN'S HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If music director Andre Previn's biggest problem with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic was lackluster attendance, then I have to wonder if Philharmonic 
executive Ernest Fleischmann or the board of directors know anything about 
conductors or records or compact discs or who's hot and who's not. 
</P>
<P>
Any classical record freak knows what kind of conductor Previn is from his long 
history of his recordings with the London Symphony: He is a laid-back, 
understated conductor who loves leisurely, thoughtful readings of long works 
and who has built a whole career conducting Walton and Elgar and Vaughan 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
If audiences here want to listen to Schumann's Fourth Symphony and if they 
don't want to hear Elgar's "Enigma" Variations, then Previn should never have 
been offered the music director's position. 
</P>
<P>
From Previn's cold reception here, it should be obvious that Lorin Maazel and 
Christoph von Donanyi shouldn't even be considered to succeed Previn, since 
they are even more laid-back and more thoughtful than Previn, having been 
successors to George Szell in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The search for a new conductor in Los Angeles sounds less like the search for a 
Scarlett O'Hara and more like a group of guys (Fleischmann and the board of 
directors) who are trying to run a doughnut shop when they don't know what a 
doughnut should look like or what a doughnut should taste like, let alone how 
to market a doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Fleischmann has ever even walked into a record store or if he ever 
listens to KFAC. If he did then he wouldn't be faced with such a ridiculous 
guessing game of who should lead the Philharmonic.

DAY HIKE: WALK ALONG BEACH FROM SUMMERLAND TO MONTECITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One might guess that Summerland was named for the weather, but the name was 
taken from spiritualist literature -- something to do with the Second Heaven of 
Spiritualism. A century ago, spiritualists pitched their tents on the tiny lots 
in this coastal area just south of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
In the waters here, the first offshore oil platform in the Western Hemisphere 
was erected in 1896. Soon, more than 300 wells were pumping oil from 
Pleistocene rocks at depths of 100 to 800 feet, an insignificant depth by 
today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
Oil attracted far more people to Summerland than spiritualism, and t he air was 
heavy with the smell of gas and oil. It was said that free illumination came 
easy -- one simply pounded a pipe into the ground until reaching natural gas 
and lit a match. Liberty Hall, the spiritualists' community center, glowed with 
divine light, and for a time Summerland became known as the White City. 
</P>
<P>
This walk travels due west along sandy Summerland Beach (parts of which are 
popular with the clothing-optional set), rounds some rocky points and concludes 
at the narrow beach in front of the famed Biltmore Hotel. Summer is a fine time 
to stroll along Summerland. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From U.S. 101 in Summerland, take the Summerland 
exit and turn oceanward to Lookout County Park. 
</P>
<P>
Consult a tide table. This beach walk is easiest and most enjoyable at low 
tide. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: At Lookout County Park is a picnic area and a monument commemorating 
the first offshore oil rig. A well-marked ramp leads to the beach. From Lookout 
(Summerland) Beach, a sea wall extends three-quarters of a mile west to Fernald 
Point. At high tide, you may wish to walk atop it, but you'll have to battle 
some brush. You soon pass a pretty little cove, bounded on the far side by 
Fernald Point, formed by a fan delta deposited at the mouth of Romero Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Around the point, as you approach Montecito, you'll see the higher parts of the 
Santa Ynez Mountains on the north skyline and the overturned beds of sandstone 
located near the peaks. There are no official public beaches in Montecito, but 
most of the shoreline receives public use: Fernald-Sharks Cove is the first 
beach you travel, then Miramar Beach below the Miramar Hotel. 
"Miramar-by-the-Sea" has been a popular watering place since the completion of 
the Southern Pacific railroad line in 1901. The hotel, with its finely 
landscaped grounds and blue-roofed bungalows, used to be a passenger stop. 
</P>
<P>
In another quarter of a mile, you'll begin hiking across Montecito's third 
beach, Hammonds, popular with surfers. Hammonds Meadows on the bluffs above the 
beach is a former Chumash habitation and a potentially rich archeological dig. 
Although it was placed recently on the National Register of Historic Places, 
it's been bulldozed for development. 
</P>
<P>
Up-coast from Hammonds you'll pass a number of fine homes and arrive at narrow 
Biltmore Beach, frequented by the rich and beautiful. Opposite the beach is the 
magnificent Biltmore Hotel, built in 1927.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN HINDSIGHT, IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY HE CHOSE TO BE A COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bones McKinney, former Wake Forest basketball coach who likes to tell stories, 
is out with a book titled, "Bones -- Honk Your Horn if You Love Basketball." 
Frank Hyland of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution passes along one of the 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney swears he flunked out of Southeastern Theological Seminary when he 
blew the key question on a midterm test. The question was, "What was Paul's 
vision on the road to Damascus?" 
</P>
<P>
McKinney's answer: "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
Raging optimism: When Toronto Blue Jays rookie Alex Sanchez walked leadoff 
batter Dan Gladden in his big league debut against the Minnesota Twins, catcher 
Bob Brenly, looking on the bright side, went to the mound and said, "Well, you 
got your first hitter out of the way and you still got your no-hitter going." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In 1915, when Babe Ruth hit the first home run of his career, in a 
game won by the New York Yankees, in what stadium was he playing? 
</P>
<P>
Add 1915: From "The Great American Sports Book" by George Gipe: "The spring of 
1915 was enlivened by aviatrix Ruth Law's dropping a grapefruit on former major 
league catcher Gabby Street, who previously had caught a baseball dropped from 
the top of the 555-foot high Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Law did not intend to drop a grapefruit, but she forgot the ball and 
selected a grapefruit at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey Stengel, then a Brooklyn Dodger outfielder, described the event: 'The 
missile caromed off the edge of the mitt and hit him in the chest. He spun 
around and then fell over, like in a Western movie where they see an Indian on 
the hill and they shoot him and he goes around in a circle and falls dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
My friends call me . . . : Dave Bristol, third base coach of the Cincinnati 
Reds, tells this story, as passed along by the Houston Chronicle: 
</P>
<P>
"Gene Mauch was the Montreal manager when Bristol coached third at Montreal. 
One night, Mauch flashed the squeeze sign. Bristol relayed it to the hitter, 
then alerted Bob Bailey, the runner at third. 
</P>
<P>
"The tipoff was, 'Anything with your last name in it,' " Bristol said. "I said, 
'Be alive, Bailey.' But Bailey calls time out and says, 'Dave, we've been 
together three years. You can call me Bob.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two in a canoe: From Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal: "Jim Kelly, Bernie 
Kosar, Vinny Testaverde, etc., have come off the quarterback assembly line at 
Miami, but Gary Stevens, the departed QB coach, says Craig Erickson will be 
better than any of the above. No kin to the new coach, Dennis Erickson, but now 
both Ericksons are on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Polo Grounds, in which both the New York Giants and Yankees 
played. Ruth, a 20-year-old pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, homered off Jack 
Warhop of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Bert Blyleven of the Angels, on how he became a pitcher instead of a 
catcher: "When I started throwing the ball back to the pitcher harder than he 
was throwing to me, we changed positions."

Troops have seized thousands of weapons since a curfew was imposed nearly two 
weeks ago to quell ethnic violence in Uzbekistan, and the death toll rose with 
the discovery of two more bodies, Tass reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official news agency, said troops had confiscated 157 firearms, 
knives and bayonets as well as 26 firebombs during road checks in the last 24 
hours. A total of 7,718 weapons have now been confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remains of two people were discovered and added to the list of 
at least 100 victims, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 buildings have been looted and burned since the brutal rampage 
against the Meskhetian Turk minority began in the Fergana Valley about 1,500 
miles southeast of Moscow, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
At least 1,500 people have been detained for violating the 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. 
curfew that went into effect June 4, the military newspaper Red Star reported. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov has dispatched two members of Parliament to 
prepare a report for the Council of Nationalities, which will investigate the 
tragedy, Tass said.

Thousands of radical South Korean students calling for the overthrow of 
President Roh Tae Woo battled riot police with firebombs, rocks and clubs 
Friday in campus protests in four cities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting involving 5,000 students occurred at five campuses in Seoul, Kwangju, 
Taejon and Chonju after riot police blocked students from marching into the 
streets, police officials said. Protesters surged out of the campuses to attack 
police with hundreds of firebombs. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said there were numerous minor injuries, but they had no 
reports of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders called for the overthrow of Roh and demanded to be allowed to 
take part in a youth festival next month in Communist North Korea. South 
Korea's government has refused to allow the students to take part in the 13th 
World Youth Festival in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, on July 1-8.

Los Angeles police said Friday that they will seek murder charges against the 
operator of a Lake View Terrace home for the elderly where two women residents 
became sick from a lack of heat in the facility and later died. 
</P>
<P>
The women, both residents of the Mountainview Board and Care Home, were 
hospitalized with hypothermia within 15 days of each other last winter, 
authorities said. They were identified as Frances Innis, 76, who died Feb. 3, 
and Carolyn Fancon, 71, who died Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the home's operator, Rebecca Cate, a nurse, used little or 
no heat in the large residential house that is state-licensed to care for up to 
six people. State records indicate temperatures in the home, which now has no 
residents, were found to be in the low 60s during inspections in winter. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Stephen Fisk said both deaths were because of negligence. "There was 
no heat in the residence, or not adequate heat for an older person," he said. 
"We now have two homicides out of the same place. We are seeking a murder 
filing." 
</P>
<P>
Fisk said he would meet Monday with Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
William Kelly, who is reviewing medical reports on the two deaths and other 
evidence, to ask for the murder charges. Kelly could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cate was at the home Friday in the 11400 block of Jeff Avenue but declined to 
talk about the deaths or the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas morning paramedics were called to the Mountainview home and found 
Fancon semiconscious on the floor, apparently after a fall, authorities said. 
Paramedics found the thermostat in the home turned down and measured Fancon's 
body temperature at 73 to 75 degrees, compared to the normal 98.6. 
</P>
<P>
Fancon died at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley a few hours later and on March 
16, 1989, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office ruled the case a 
homicide. "This unfortunate lady died of hypothermia due to negligence (no heat 
in the residence)," an autopsy report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 4, an inspector from the state Department of Social Services, which 
licensed the facility, visited the home after the agency was told of the death. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Garcia, a staff attorney for the agency, said the inspector found the 
temperature was 61 degrees inside the home at noon. Cate was cited for not 
keeping the temperature above a state mandated 68 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Six days after the inspection, Innis was taken from the home to Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital suffering from hypothermia. Her body temperature was 
84 degrees, authorities said. She died 24 days later after developing 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the Department of Social Services is in the process of revoking the 
license Cate received in December, 1987, to operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
After Innis died, the one resident who remained in Cate's care was placed in 
another home after inspectors again found low temperatures in the home -- 
ranging from 62 to 66 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a verbal agreement from Mrs. Cate that she is not going to operate," 
Garcia said. "We have been monitoring the home very closely."

CHINA'S CONSULAR CORPS IN L.A. NOW 'KEEPS OUT OF SIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the recent unrest and violence in China, there used to be lines of 
tourists and business representatives at the Chinese Consulate, seeking visas 
to travel in the People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Now the third-floor offices on Shatto Place in the Wilshire District seem 
quiet, with only two people on one recent morning standing at a window before a 
lone official. A take-a-number machine, such as those used in popular 
delicatessens, sat idle. 
</P>
<P>
"We do our work as usual," the official, Lee Yufeng, who described himself as 
the visa consul, said stoically. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he said, visa applications were down "a little bit," since May 20, 
when martial law was declared in Beijing. The office had issued more than 1,000 
visas a month after opening with considerable fanfare 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But after disappearing for a few moments, Lee came back and adjusted his 
statement. "The number of applications is the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one else at the consulate would discuss its activities. But local officials 
and members of the Chinese community say the once highly visible Chinese 
diplomats in Los Angeles seem to have disappeared in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They're low-profile now," said Irvin Lai, a Chinese-American who said he 
became familiar with members of the delegation as national president of the 
Chinese-American Citizens Alliance. Before, he added, "they had a lot of 
receptions for Chinese-Americans, did a lot of entertaining, encouraging them 
to go visit their roots in China." 
</P>
<P>
These days, he said, "they keep out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
Bee Canterbury Lavery, the Los Angeles chief of protocol, said that before the 
unrest she had been in almost daily contact with Consul General Ma Yuzhen, whom 
she described as an outgoing and well-liked member of the local diplomatic 
community. In recent weeks, she said, "I haven't seen him." 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokeswoman, Ma declined an interview because "this time is not 
convenient." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators have turned out in large numbers every recent weekend outside the 
gleaming white, five-story office building where the consulate is housed. But 
during the week it is quiet. On Thursday morning, for example, only two members 
of a local ashram were keeping a vigil on the sidewalk, and no one was there 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, thousands more are expected, when members of what organizers 
call "hundreds of Chinese-American organizations" plan a 2 p.m. rally in 
MacArthur Park, followed by a march to the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no defections from the Los Angeles consulate, which 
reportedly has a staff of more than 30, in contrast to two from China's San 
Francisco consulate. Stephen C. Chang, a reporter for the Chinese-language 
Young China Daily in Monterey Park, said he telephones the Los Angeles 
consulate daily to tell any staff members he can reach, "we have organizations 
to help in case you make up your mind to leave your government." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations of Harassment 
</P>
<P>
But nowadays, he said, he often just reaches a tape-recording. 
</P>
<P>
Harry J. Godfrey III, head of FBI counterintelligence in Los Angeles, said that 
in the last few weeks his office has been "vigorously pursuing allegations of 
harassment and intimidation" of Chinese nationals -- including an estimated 
3,000 students -- living in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, several people have reported anonymous phone calls telling 
them not to criticize the Chinese government, or "your family in China will be 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, FBI and other military counterintelligence officials 
disclosed that Chinese espionage agents had surpassed the Soviets as the most 
active foreign spies in California. Godfrey declined comment this week on 
whether there had been a recent increase or decrease in Chinese intelligence 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dramatic Presence' 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Consulate was one of the most active of the 68 consulates in Los 
Angeles, protocol chief Lavery said: "They have had a dramatic presence." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lavery and others, Consul General Ma, an experienced diplomat who 
speaks English, frequently gave speeches to local colleges and last month spoke 
before the monthly meeting of the city's consular corps. 
</P>
<P>
He was often seen at events staged by a variety of cultural or civic groups. In 
the last year, the consulate has shepherded more than 1,000 visiting Chinese 
delegations around Los Angeles. Two months ago, its officials accompanied Xan 
Xu, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, when he gave a speech to the 
Los Angeles World Affairs Council. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference before and after the massacre," a Chinese native of 
Taiwan said, referring to the killings in Beijing's Tian An Men Square earlier 
this month. Taiwan, which lost its diplomatic status with the United States 
once this country recognized China in 1978, maintains a Coordination Council 
that represents Taiwanese interests here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uphill Battle 
</P>
<P>
Local members of the Chinese community, which numbers more than 200,000 
throughout Southern California, say the mainland Chinese delegation has had to 
fight an uphill battle in Los Angeles because of both pro-Taiwan and strong 
anti-communist sentiments among many local Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of hard feelings," said Chinatown businessman David Lee, 
who has endured criticism for a decade because of his public support of China. 
Many believe that this contributed to the closing of his Chinatown restaurant, 
General Lee's, three years ago for lack of business. 
</P>
<P>
Lavery said of Ma: "I think he has made great strides in Los Angeles for 
overseas Chinese to understand China. I have to almost say that in the past 
(tense) because I thought I understood China." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has a sister-city program with Canton, and Lavery, who serves on 
the board of the Los Angeles-Canton Sister City Assn., said this has been 
suspended since the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Document Sent 
</P>
<P>
The only official document the Chinese Consulate has sent the mayor's office in 
recent weeks has been a copy of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on its 
actions toward the Beijing students, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Lavery telephoned Ma in the city's behalf, she said. "I asked him to send a 
message to his government how deplorable this action was and how outraged those 
of us who considered ourselves friends of China . . . were. He listened to me 
very politely. Did he argue with me? No he did not."

A FATHER'S DAY GIFT; 
</P>
<P>
BABY DAUGHTER INSPIRES HOMELESS MAN TO REPAIR HIS LIFE

<P>
The first time 40-year-old James McFarland saw his youngest daughter, Bobbie 
Charisse, it was through the bulletproof glass of the visitors' room at the 
Biscailuz Center jail. At first, he stood dazed. As the tears streamed from his 
eyes, he pressed his nose against the shield, trying in vain to make contact 
with hers. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried talking to her, but she didn't understand what was going on," 
McFarland recalls. "She kept laughing. . . . 'Oh God,' I thought, 'Why now? Why 
here?' " 
</P>
<P>
McFarland, now living in a shelter for the homeless on Skid Row, says he is 
slowly addressing these questions while reacquainting himself with his 
2-year-old daughter as a first step to getting off the streets and back into 
society. Chaplains at the Los Angeles Mission, McFarland's temporary home, say 
he is winning the psychological battle faced by many fathers who grow up in 
broken homes and for whom Father's Day has no particular meaning. 
</P>
<P>
By taking time to visit his daughter, McFarland says he is trying to turn back 
the clock on his admittedly unsatisfactory attempts at fatherhood. "This is a 
chance to be something to somebody, to be a father to my child, and to be an 
example to other people who are in my situation." 
</P>
<P>
If he succeeds, mission officials say, McFarland will serve as a welcome 
example. "Many people take Father's Day for granted, but a lot of men who come 
from broken homes face the pain of becoming like the fathers they never knew," 
said Cedric J. Hinson, a chaplain at the mission, which emphasizes family 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to McFarland say his problems began at a young age. His parents 
were divorced when he was 5. He spent his boyhood with his mother and a 
great-aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"James didn't spend nearly as much time as he should have with his father," 
says Dorothy Smoot, McFarland's mother, who lives in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Later, there was service in Vietnam, a failed marriage and a layoff from his 
job as a machine operator at a paper factory. McFarland left Memphis for 
Southern California more than 12 years ago, leaving behind in his mother's care 
two daughters, Angela, now 18, and Janice, 17. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, McFarland said his life changed dramatically when he began 
working for a local charter bus and car service. "I was raking in about $1,600 
a week, and I was using up most of it on marijuana and other drugs before 
cocaine came into the picture. Some co-workers introduced me to it, and from 
then on, I used it to socialize . . . until I became addicted." The addiction 
to cocaine was the start of a downhill slide. McFarland and his girlfriend, 
Verdester Powell, 35, were sharing an apartment in Inglewood before an argument 
ended their relationship. Powell later discovered she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McFarland's increasingly expensive drug habit cost him his 
apartment, forcing him to live in his car and make extended visits to friends' 
homes "to secure a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, during a routine check, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
discovered that he had failed to pay several traffic tickets and McFarland was 
carted off to County Jail to serve a 20-day sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Meeting 
</P>
<P>
It was there that McFarland had his memorable first meeting with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie was born June 15, 1987, one day before McFarland's 38th birthday. But 
McFarland, by then a drifter on the streets of Los Angeles, was never told. 
Powell, a custodial supervisor employed with the Los Angeles Police Academy, 
said she used her police contacts to trace McFarland to Biscailuz Center in 
East Los Angeles. "I just wanted him to see his child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And was he shocked!" Powell exclaimed, raising her eyebrows as she recalled 
the meeting. "He didn't know what to say on that day." 
</P>
<P>
After McFarland's release from jail, home became a series of derelict cars and 
abandoned houses. "In the meantime, I was still doing little odds and ends, 
selling cans and stuff, to buy drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after Thanksgiving last year that McFarland said he finally 
recognized his dilemma. "I knew I needed help, but I was hardened. I felt then 
that the entire world didn't care, so I wasn't prepared to give anyone a chance 
to help me out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turning Point 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in January when he walked into the Los Angeles Mission 
and enrolled in its spiritual growth program, which combines spiritual 
counseling with work experience. 
</P>
<P>
Hinson said McFarland fit the profile of the majority of the 2,500 homeless men 
who seek refuge monthly at the private, nonprofit Los Angeles Mission. "He had 
a history of alcoholism and drug abuse, and he felt that the whole world didn't 
care any longer, so he didn't either." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he entered the mission's program, McFarland requested help in 
locating his daughter. "We all prayed with him and a few days later he heard 
from the child's mother," Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland, who says he is waging a successful battle against drug addiction, 
now makes almost weekly visits to see Bobbie. Powell, who has remarried, said 
she has no objections. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I should have been doing all the time," McFarland said, noting 
that he had last seen his two daughters in Memphis almost six years ago. "I 
really feel bad about it. 
</P>
<P>
"And now there is not much I can give (Bobbie) materially," added McFarland, 
who receives a $10 weekly stipend for his work at the mission. "But I want her 
to know that I am always around and that I am her father." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father's Day Celebration 
</P>
<P>
During a visit last week, Bobbie, clothed in a pink dress, was at the door to 
greet her father. He picked her up in his arms, and as he began to smother her 
with kisses they rubbed noses. McFarland thinks he has taken the first steps to 
overcome the odds. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is looking forward to what promises to be a more memorable meeting 
with his daughter. Powell has planned an early Father's Day party and a 
celebration to mark last week's birthdays of both father and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland said he has requested no expensive presents. "Being with her is 
enough. I just want to sit back and enjoy it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCA NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE IDENTIFY SLAIN DRUG DEALER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected drug dealer killed by a SWAT officer raiding a South-Central area 
rock cocaine house was identified Friday as Isadore Lyman Green, 31, of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Scott Reitz, 36, fired two shots from his 12-gauge shotgun at Green, 
striking him in the head and chest Thursday afternoon as he reached for a 
sawed-off shotgun when officers ordered him to put his hands over his head, Lt. 
William Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Green was pronounced dead at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center shortly 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Reitz, a 13-year veteran, was among a group of Special Weapons and Tactics team 
members who forced their way into the fortified house at 810 W. 80th St. Police 
had learned it was a rock house from drug buyers recently arrested in the area, 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The SWAT officers confronted Green as he sat on the kitchen floor, a sawed-off 
shotgun at his side, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect refused the officers commands to put his hands on top of his head 
and suddenly reached for the shotgun," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found several rocks of cocaine at the house, Hall said.

POMONA CEMETERY ACCUSED OF MIXING, DUMPING CREMATION ASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office is looking into allegations that workers at 
a Pomona cemetery mixed together the ashes of cremated corpses in a garbage can 
and dumped them in a vacant lot that is now a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations, made by three former employees who lost their jobs at Pomona 
Valley Memorial Park earlier this year, have been investigated by the state 
Cemetery Board, which finished its report earlier this week. The attorney 
general's office received the report Friday and will issue its response next 
week, spokeswoman Christie Mullen said. 
</P>
<P>
John Gill, executive director of the Cemetery Board, would not comment 
specifically on the report's findings, but said the board uncovered sufficient 
evidence to warrant consideration by the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't send it on to your attorney if you didn't have something," Gill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the cemetery, John Lemons, did not return phone calls 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inquiry Started 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Friday, attorney Thomas E. Frankovich told reporters that 
ashes may have been dumped illegally at the construction site across the street 
from the cemetery for more than 20 years. Frankovich is representing four 
families who had relatives cremated at Pomona Valley Memorial Park, and he was 
joined at the press conference by four former cemetery employees. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began last month when former cemetery workers Jeff Uwnauich, 
Joseph Hatchett and Manuel Estrada charged that the dumping of ashes was a 
standard practice at the cemetery. Uwnauich and Estrada were laid off by the 
cemetery in April and Hatchett was fired in March. 
</P>
<P>
Another former employee, Anthony Tamburro, who worked at the cemetery from 1961 
until his retirement in 1974, said at the press conference that the alleged 
practices were commonplace when he worked there. He supervised cremations for 
three of those years. 
</P>
<P>
In about 90% of the cremations performed at the cemetery, all the ashes and 
crushed bones would not fit in a single urn, Uwnauich told reporters. The 
excess remains were placed in a 20-gallon trash can, which was taken 
periodically to the lot across the street from the cemetery and its contents 
dumped in a hole, he alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing together human ashes in such a manner has been a misdemeanor in 
California since 1984. The Cemetery Board may also impose administrative 
penalties, including suspension or revocation of a cemetery's license, if human 
remains have been improperly handled, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Bodies 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the dumping of ashes, Uwnauich and Hatchett alleged that they 
once saw workers cram three bodies into a crypt designed for two. Silver and 
gold dental filings extracted from the ashes reportedly were sometimes pocketed 
by employees or kept by the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Frankovich said he plans to ask the attorney general to order an exhumation of 
the lot. The land was purchased last year by Upland-based Lewis Homes 
Management Corp. and is being graded for the construction of 90 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Frankovich, who has offered a $1,000 reward for information about illegal 
cremations at the Pomona cemetery, said none of the families he represents know 
for certain that their relatives' ashes were dumped in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assumes Worst 
</P>
<P>
However, Alice Alexandre, whose parents and 18-year-old son were cremated at 
the cemetery, said the former employees' allegations have caused her to assume 
the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking out in that field, knowing my son's out there," she said. "Part 
of my son and my parents is out there. Something's got to be done. . . . This 
is the worst kind of betrayal."

BUDGET REQUESTS UNDERSCORE COUNTY'S UNMET NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A homeless man asked for an increase in his $312 monthly welfare check. A woman 
who tearfully admitted to beating her 8-year-old daughter urged continuation of 
a treatment program for child abusers. And dozens of bureaucrats requested just 
about everything, from more gloves to protect the coroner's staff from AIDS and 
other infectious diseases to an additional agricultural inspector to check 
traps for killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
They were among the scores of people who traveled to the county Hall of 
Administration this week to speak for four minutes each at the Board of 
Supervisors' budget hearings. Some came alone and politely asked the 
supervisors for more money. Others, including a hundred social workers upset 
about proposed increases in their already heavy caseloads, staged noisy 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the requests portrayed a county government overwhelmed with unmet 
needs of the poor and the mentally ill and a jail system that has been forced 
to release offenders because of chronic overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The problems facing the supervisors came to light amid continued uncertainty 
over how much the county will receive of the new-found $2.5-billion state 
surplus. Actual deliberations on the county's proposed $9.2-billion spending 
plan will not begin until July, after supervisors know how much the county will 
receive from the state. But that decision will be made hundreds of miles away 
in the corridors, meeting rooms and private offices of the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Sources 
</P>
<P>
The county relies on a mix of local revenue sources, including property taxes 
and special assessments, plus money from the state. The state money is used to 
run the courts, hospitals for the poor, mental health clinics and jails. But 
the state has reduced the amount of money available for such programs, even 
though costs have risen with the growing numbers of the mentally ill and the 
poor and increased arrests by law enforcement 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have some money -- at least $750 million -- which they can spend as 
they see fit. The conservative-dominated board in recent years has chosen to 
spend more for law enforcement and less on social programs. The proposed 
1989-90 budget, drafted by the chief administrative officer, reflects that 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
In the hearings, Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon expressed optimism 
that the county will receive enough of the state surplus to avert many, if not 
all, of the threatened cuts in health and other services. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the state provides additional money, "it will not be enough to meet 
all of the problems that (supervisors) are agonizing over," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still not a bright picture because of all the unmet needs," said 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, a member of the board's liberal minority. 
</P>
<P>
Which programs will receive more funding will depend on how much the state 
provides and whether the money is earmarked for specific purposes. If the money 
comes with no strings attached, supervisors can spend it as they please. 
</P>
<P>
The week's public hearings, which ended Thursday, were required by law. 
Supervisors said they hoped the hearings would draw the attention of state 
leaders to the county's problems, though the event most widely covered by 
television was an earthquake that sent the crowd sprinting to the exits. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors listened politely to advocates for the mentally ill and the 
poor, doctors and patients from county hospitals and mental health clinics, 
county labor union leaders and bureaucrats.. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for speaking," Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said before anyone took the 
microphone. "But we have no money." 
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly implored speakers to "go to Sacramento" to lobby state officials 
for more aid to the county. 
</P>
<P>
County welfare director Eddy Tanaka underscored the supervisors' dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires the county to provide general relief for indigents who are 
not eligible for other programs. However, the state does not provide any money 
to pay for the program. There are about 49,000 people on general relief and the 
number is growing, Tanaka told supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Office Closings 
</P>
<P>
To meet this increase -- and provide a $10 increase in the $312-a-month 
allowance -- Tanaka has proposed closing four welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Overcrowded lobbies, long waits for service and increased complaints regarding 
service are predictable," he told supervisors, assessing the impact of the 
proposed closures. "It is predictable that we will have an increase in the 
number of disturbances due to hostile clients." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors also heard from a homeless man and from legal aid attorneys who 
asked for an increase in the general relief allowance. 
</P>
<P>
"You present a real problem," Hahn said to one of the speakers. "The only 
rentals are on Skid Row, and they're $300 a month, and the (housing allowance) 
is only $200 a month." 
</P>
<P>
Parents of sexually abused children also urged supervisors in emotional 
testimony to save a program that provides treatment to the children and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"Perpetrators are being healed in your program," said the mother of a 
6-year-old sexually abused child. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who beat her 8-year-old daughter, who is now in a foster home, said 
that by court order her daughter cannot visit her home unless the family is 
enrolled in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know which one of you," she told supervisors while sobbing, "will 
tell my daughter she cannot come home." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the requests to supervisors dealt with more obscure areas of county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pollutes Bay 
</P>
<P>
An environmentalist urged supervisors to spend more to clean out the clutter 
that gathers in storm drains and pollutes Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy asked for money to hire an additional 
inspector to check traps for the Africanized honey bee, also known as the 
killer bee. He warned that the bee, reportedly headed toward California, can 
wreak havoc with domestic bee colonies and has been known to attack humans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who spoke at the hearings questioned whether their testimony will 
have any impact on supervisors, who have their own pet programs. Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum, for example, has pledged to fight proposed cuts in the Museum 
of Natural History budget. Edelman has said he will seek to increase funding 
for drug treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers complained about the absence of Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
from most of the four days of hearings. Antonovich was in Switzerland attending 
a conference on refugee relief. An aide said the supervisor will review a 
transcript of the hearings.

FORMER UCLA BASKETBALL PLAYER HEARS PRAISE, THEN 9-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former UCLA center Darrell Allums heard the kind of testimonials Friday that he 
once must have dreamed would come at the end of a long and successful 
basketball career, and not just before he was sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Allums, who played on a team that finished second in the 1980 NCAA basketball 
championships, listened intently Friday as a stream of supporters sang his 
praises on the witness stand in Torrance Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
First UCLA basketball Coach Jim Harrick, an assistant coach in Allums' days on 
campus, called the former Bruin center "a young man prepared to contribute to 
society." Then former teammate and current UCLA assistant coach Brad Holland 
described the 6-foot, 9-inch Allums as a player who always rose to the occasion 
in big games. Finally, there were emotional comments from his mother, who 
called Allums a "loving and giving person." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9-Year Sentence 
</P>
<P>
Tributes aside, Judge William R. Hollingsworth sentenced Allums to nine years 
in state prison for robbing eight Domino's Pizza deliverymen. He faces two 
additional years in prison if he is convicted of possession of cocaine when he 
returns to court for a separate trial June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Allums, 30, has served nearly two years in Los Angeles County Jail since his 
arrest June 22, 1987. If he continues to earn credits for good behavior and 
prison work, he could be released from state prison in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Hollingsworth said he sympathized with Allums -- who admitted committing the 
robberies to pay for a runaway cocaine habit -- but that he was bound by state 
law to punish the former player for the string of armed robberies in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The judge compared Allums to former University of Maryland basketball star Len 
Bias, who died of a cocaine overdose. "I am convinced that, but for drugs, Mr. 
Allums never would have been here," Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Allums appeared glum, looking down at his feet, as the judge denied his 
lawyer's attempts to send him to a drug rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robberies Admitted 
</P>
<P>
Moments before, Allums had admitted for the first time that he committed the 
robberies. "It was a situation where I had no control over it," Allums said. "I 
never intended to hurt anyone. It was just a means to get money to get drugs. . 
. . I was out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that 14 times in April and June of 1987, Allums called the 
pizza chain's outlets, usually in the South Bay, and ordered small pizzas and 
six-packs of soda. But when deliverymen visited the addresses they found no one 
at home and were confronted instead by Allums, who usually wielded a 
screwdriver, Deputy Dist. Atty. Julie Sulman said. Allums usually took the 
sodas and cash, ranging from $20 to more than $100, and ran off, leaving the 
pizzas behind. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Allums in March of committing eight of the robberies, and the 
remaining six charges were dropped when that same jury could not reach a 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Allums said in an 11-page handwritten letter to the judge that he began 
experimenting with drugs in high school but that his downfall began after two 
short stints in professional basketball -- the first with the Dallas Mavericks 
and the second with a pro team in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"I was introduced to free-base cocaine," Allums wrote. "That was the worst 
mistake I ever made in my life. . . . It would later be my destruction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injury Ended Career 
</P>
<P>
Allums said he dropped drugs for a time when he took a job with a team in 
Switzerland. But a knee injury ended his basketball career and he returned to 
the United States, plunging deeper into cocaine addiction, he said.

HUNGARY GIVES PATRIOT'S BURIAL TO MARTYR NAGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES T. POWERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-one years after he was hanged as a traitor to communism, Imre Nagy, 
premier for 13 dramatic days during the 1956 Hungarian revolt, was given a 
patriot's burial here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of perhaps 100,000 flocked to Heroes Square, not only to pay tribute to 
Nagy and other martyrs of the only full-blown armed rebellion against communism 
since the division of Europe, but to mark what one speaker called "the border 
between two great epochs." 
</P>
<P>
Until a little more than a year ago, the name of Nagy and other figures 
associated with the revolt were taboo to the Communist authorities who took 
over after Nagy was deposed by Soviet tanks. But Hungary is now embarked on 
some of the same reforms, including a multi-party system, that Nagy envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sovereign Hungary' 
</P>
<P>
"We want this day to begin work toward a new world to realize the aims that 
these people died for," said Imre Mecs, a longtime dissident who, himself, had 
been sentenced to death by a Communist court after the 1956 revolt. "We want a 
free, independent and sovereign Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd ranged from children to the elderly and sometimes tearful men and 
women who remembered vividly the tumultuous days of October, 1956, when secret 
policemen were hanged from lampposts and Soviet tanks on Budapest's squares 
blasted away at suspected rebel strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
The throng was solemn throughout the proceedings, bursting into prolonged 
applause for only one of a parade of speakers, Viktor Orban, a student leader 
who declared, "The Communists took away our future." 
</P>
<P>
He drew still more applause when he added, "A lot of politicians are saying now 
they are the inheritors of Imre Nagy's inspiration. Two years ago, they were 
blaming him for counterrevolution. Today, they want to touch his coffin as a 
talisman." 
</P>
<P>
By and large, however, the Communist officials of Hungary realized that this 
was not their day, and kept clear of the proceedings. Premier Miklos Nemeth and 
Parliament Speaker Matyas Szuros attended the Heroes Square ceremonies and laid 
a wreath before six coffins arrayed against a white backdrop on the steps of 
the national museum. But not even Nemeth, one of the government's leading 
reformers, was invited to speak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Unknown Revolutionary' 
</P>
<P>
In the coffins were the remains of Nagy and four associates -- his chief of 
staff, Jozsef Szilagyi; defense minister Pal Maleter; journalist Miklos Gimes; 
and minister of state Geza Losonczy. The sixth coffin was empty, a symbol to 
represent "the unknown revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
Nagy and his associates had been buried in unmarked graves in Plot 301 of the 
sprawling Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest. Until recently, the plot had been 
allowed to go untended, with even its exact location an official secret. 
However, dissidents and Nagy's family located the graves years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy had served as Hungary's premier from 1953 to 1955, but his reformist 
notions, including a multi-party system and an end to one-sided economic 
arrangements with the Soviet Union, led to his replacement. He was called back 
to office, however, on the second day of the 1956 rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks later, after he announced that Hungary was withdrawing from 
the Warsaw Pact, Soviet tanks invaded Budapest, putting down the revolt in two 
days. At Soviet direction, Nagy was replaced by Janos Kadar, who held power 
here until May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar's replacement by Karoly Grosz and a team of reformers triggered an 
official re-evaluation of the 1956 events, and a special Communist Party 
subcommittee on history set out to decide whether the revolt should be 
redefined as a "popular uprising" rather than a "counterrevolution" as the 
Communists had designated it officially for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emerging Parties 
</P>
<P>
This raised pressure for a re-evaluation of Nagy, long a hero to Hungarian 
dissidents and opposition groups. Still more pressure was added by a decision 
to allow the re-emergence of political parties, which are now preparing for the 
first postwar, multi-party elections, probably early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Grosz himself has said he does not believe that Nagy should be 
"rehabilitated," he said the party would review its position if new facts 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government, as opposed to the Communist Party, has been more 
forthcoming. On Wednesday, the government, in the most outspoken official 
statement on the issue, declared that Nagy was a "prominent statesman" and said 
that "the ideas of democratic humanitarian and national-minded endeavors of 
Imre Nagy and his followers are major constituents of the present government 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
However, Nagy's daughter, Erzsebet, may have reflected the views of most 
Hungarians when she said she does not consider the Communist Party worthy of 
rehabilitating her father. "I am not even asking this party to do it," she said 
on the day her father's unmarked grave was opened. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there was little good will to be expended on the Communists among the 
crowd at Heroes Square or among the mourners following the funeral procession 
to the Kozma Street Cemetery where Nagy was reburied in the same grave he had 
occupied for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
A 75-year-old retired steel worker, clutching a red carnation and a handful of 
newspapers memorializing Nagy, began weeping when he spoke of 1956. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the streets," he said. "I was there. I was arrested. I was beaten up. 
Now this. We have waited for such a long time. The Russians have been running 
us for 30 years. Thirty years! And Kadar has taken all the money and put it 
into his pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Trembling, the man wiped at his tears with a wadded handkerchief. His friend, a 
retired miner, steadied him with an arm around his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"We want change," the second man said, "but we want to be safe and secure. We 
have our history to teach us. That's why we have mixed feelings about this day. 
Every time we celebrate something, we lose." 
</P>
<P>
While many in the crowd said they felt the memorial service marked a "turning 
point" or a "break with the past" in Hungarian political history, there were 
also many who said they felt apprehension about the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Communism in Retreat' 
</P>
<P>
"This is all new," said Dr. Akos Kiss, wearing the armband and lapel pin of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum, one of the emerging political parties. "What is 
going on here, and in Poland, has never been attempted in this way. It is 
communism in retreat, but no one can say if the retreat will go smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
While the changes may not go smoothly, particularly in the economy, the newly 
awakened spirit of public discourse would seem difficult to reverse. On the 
streets Friday, hawkers sold poster portraits of Imre Nagy and accounts of the 
1956 rebellion that would have been banned two years ago. Souvenir salesmen did 
a brisk business peddling lapel pins depicting the crown of St. Stephen, a 
badge of nationalist independence and an anti-Communist symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian newspapers put out special editions and television replayed lengthy 
documentaries on Nagy's life, including his trial, recently described by the 
state's public prosecutor as a sham proceeding that "gravely and repeatedly 
violated the rules of criminal procedure." 
</P>
<P>
But the new openness inspired little faith Friday among Nagy's old allies and 
the dissidents who have rallied around the symbol that his name represents. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 30 years, the truth of Hungarian history could not be spoken," 
said one speaker before Nagy's coffin was once again lowered into the ground. 
"It has been a constant fight for freedom in our country, and it is the great 
tradition of our country that will not die." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FAREWELL TO THE REVOLUTION 
</P>
<P>
More than three decades after the 1956 Hungarian revolt, a huge crowd gathered 
in Budapest's Heroes Square to pay tribute to their former leader, Imre Nagy, 
who was at last given a patriot's burial. Nagy, who was hanged as a traitor to 
communism, and four of his associates had been buried in unmarked graves. But 
last November, after months of pressure, Karoly Grosz, Hungary's current 
leader, agreed to the reburial. 
</P>
<P>
The Victims 
</P>
<P>
Imre Nagy: Premier from 1953-55, he initiated the first reform program in 
Hungary. Was sentenced to death at show trial and executed June 16, 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Pal Maleter: Part of military high command before becoming Nagy's defense 
minister. Executed with Nagy. 
</P>
<P>

October uprising began. Executed with Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
Geza Losonczy: Was minister of state in Nagy's Cabinet. Died in prison in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Jozsef Szilagyi: Chief police commissioner of Hungary. Was among Nagy's closest 
friends. Served as head of the Secretariat. Executed in April, 1958.

HOLMES TUTTLE, A FORCE IN REAGAN POLITICAL RISE, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican fund raiser Holmes Tuttle, who refused to take no for an answer when 
Ronald Reagan at first declined to run for governor of California in the 
mid-1960s, died Friday morning at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. He would have 
been 84 today. 
</P>
<P>
His son-in-law, Joseph J. Keon, said Tuttle, who had lived in Montecito for 
several years, suffered a stroke eight weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle succeeded in persuading the reluctant Reagan that he should run for 
governor in 1966. Reagan won, was elected to a second term and then in 1980, 
with Tuttle's support, was elected President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle's greatest ambition was realized when Reagan became President. Tuttle 
loved Reagan like a brother because their conservative political philosophies 
were identical. Reagan was his alter-ego, his idol. 
</P>
<P>
A wealthy automobile dealer, Tuttle had been one of Reagan's closest friends 
and advisers since they met in 1946, when Tuttle sold Reagan a Ford coupe. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle had been the dominant force in Reagan's "kitchen cabinet" -- the group 
of 10 or so wealthy financial backers whose advice Reagan respected and often 
followed -- in Sacramento and later in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle was born in Tuttle, Okla. (a community named for his farm family) when 
it was still Indian territory, and started out as a stock boy in a Ford plant 
in Oklahoma City in 1923. He came to Los Angeles three years later. 
</P>
<P>
A short profile on Tuttle published in 1980 had him riding into Los Angeles on 
a freight train. His son, Robert, believes instead that someone gave his father 
a ride to Los Angeles in an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. Cook, then a Ford dealer and later a wealthy Los Angeles investor, 
gave Tuttle a job as parts manager at his dealership. Tuttle and Cook remained 
lifelong friends and business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle later opened his own Ford dealership in Los Angeles and then 
established, one after the other, Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in 
Beverly Hills; Spokane, Wash.; Irvine, and Tucson, Ariz. He became one of the 
most successful dealers in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
As he became wealthy, Tuttle became active in conservative Republican politics. 
He never apparently aspired to political office himself but was always ready to 
raise money for any candidate who shared his views. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of a number of prosperous Los Angeles businessmen active in 
Republican fund-raising. One of the others was Henry Salvatori, also a member 
of Reagan's kitchen cabinet. But there was a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"If you need money," a Republican Party official once said, "Henry (Salvatori) 
will write you a $5,000 check. Holmes will go out and raise $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle got a lot of those contributions for Reagan in his gubernatorial and 
presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
It was a speech Reagan made on behalf of Barry Goldwater's unsuccessful bid for 
President in 1964 that persuaded Tuttle that Reagan had the makings not only of 
a great governor but also of a great President. 
</P>
<P>
The speech, in which Reagan eloquently outlined his conservative Republican 
position, was described by Washington columnist David S. Broder as "the most 
successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified 
the 1896 Democratic convention with his 'Cross of Gold' speech." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan made the speech at Tuttle's request at a $1,000-a-plate Republican 
dinner in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have anybody, so I called up Ron and asked if he wouldn't give a 
20-minute talk," Tuttle later recalled. "After the speech, we were swamped with 
requests from people who said these are the things Goldwater's been missing. We 
decided we had to get that speech on television." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overwhelming Response 
</P>
<P>
When Reagan's speech was televised on Oct. 27, shortly before the election, 
viewers were so impressed that they sent in an estimated $600,000 to $1 million 
in contributions for the Republican cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Good gracious alive, after the speech was over, I was besieged," Tuttle told 
an interviewer. "This is what people wanted to hear, and poor Barry had gone on 
the defensive." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said he "called Henry Salvatori and some others, and we went to Ron and 
discussed the idea of his running for governor." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan begged off, explaining that he was too busy with television and other 
projects. The Republican businessmen withdrew, but Tuttle later went back. 
</P>
<P>
"Holmes came up to the house specifically to see me," Reagan said later. "I 
gave him the usual thing about running for office." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle was persistent, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you agree not to give us a flat no?" he asked Reagan. "Just kick it 
around in your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan relented and agreed to do that. Tuttle and his friends started a Friends 
of Reagan organization. The pressure and support became so great that Reagan 
agreed to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle explained that it was more than just Reagan's ability as a speaker that 
persuaded him that the actor should run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't give a damn," Tuttle said, "how good looking a man was, how 
attractive he was or how good he could speak if I thought his political 
philosophy and fundamental principles were contrary to mine, but this man had 
everything going for him." 
</P>
<P>
Several years after Reagan's kitchen cabinet was formed, Tuttle remarked: 
</P>
<P>
"As for any of us making the decisions or anyone else making the decisions, 
that is not right. There's no kitchen cabinet that makes any decisions for the 
governor. I guarantee that. 
</P>
<P>
"That Irish Dutchman makes his own decisions. That governor is a strong 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
But there was never any doubt that Tuttle had a powerful influence on Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron always takes a call from Holmes," an aide to Reagan said after he was 
elected President. 
</P>
<P>
Usually a quiet, soft-spoken man who was suspicious of reporters, Tuttle could 
"talk like a trooper" whenever defending Reagan's interests, one of those 
reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980 presidential campaign, Tuttle publicly described President 
Jimmy Carter as "a mean, vitriolic little guy." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle was still raising money for Reagan in the last years of his life. He got 
23 people from the oil industry to donate $270,000 toward redecoration of the 
White House living quarters. Tuttle contributed $10,000 to that fund. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he was one of nearly 20 friends who purchased the $2.5-million Bel-Air 
Estates home now occupied by the former President and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle was active as well with Salvatori and other conservatives in raising 
money to defeat then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other state 
Supreme Court liberals, Joseph Grodin and Cruz Reynoso, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Next to helping Reagan get elected President, Tuttle probably was proudest of 
two other personal accomplishments -- his election in the 1970s to Oklahoma's 
Cowboy Hall of Fame and his being honored by the Ford Motor Co. in 1973 for his 
50-year association with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, then governor, and his wife, Nancy, were among 400 friends of Tuttle 
who helped him celebrate his golden anniversary with Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his son Robert, Tuttle is survived by his wife, Virginia; a daughter, 
Sally Keon, and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Tuttle was in charge of White House personnel during the Reagan 
administration. Robert Tuttle's wife, Donna, served as undersecretary of 
commerce for travel and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be conducted Monday at 1 p.m. at All-Saints-by-the-Sea 
in Montecito. Family graveside services will be at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park. 
</P>
<P>
The family asked that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to Childrens 
Hospital in Los Angeles.

NOTHING SUBTLE ON EIFFEL TOWER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early in the show, two men ablaze but in special asbestos suits will ascend the 
Eiffel Tower while 53 others jump off it, tied by elastic cords. 
</P>
<P>
Later, rock singer Johnny Halliday, known as "the French Elvis," will roar onto 
a huge stage, built at the foot of the tower, in the company of 100 
leather-jacketed motorcyclists and their bikes. From the stage, from barges in 
the Seine, from holes in a giant birthday cake at the Palais de Chaillot, will 
emerge music, dancers, tightrope walkers, fashion models, fireworks and laser 
beams. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ronald Reagan and his friend, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris will 
unveil the 76-foot tall cake. One thousand chefs will pour out of the huge 
pastry, with candles and slices of cake for le peuple. 
</P>
<P>
Happy 100th birthday, Eiffel Tower! Happy 200th anniversary, French Revolution! 
</P>
<P>
The cost of Mayor Chirac's 89-minute party tonight for several hundred thousand 
guests: $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, it seems. This is no time for prix fixe. This is a time of 
Revolutionary excess and Bicentennial one-upsmanship in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone by arch-rival Chirac, his opponent in a bitter presidential 
election last year, President Francois Mitterrand, has invited President Bush, 
29 other world leaders and an estimated crowd of 2 million to his own party for 
the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitterrand party, a parade that will include elephants, horses painted to 
look like zebras and the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band doing the moon-walk 
down the Avenue des Champs Elysees, is expected to cost $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Chirac and Mitterrand deny any revelry rivalry. However, Mitterrand 
was not invited to Chirac's party tonight. Nor was Chirac invited to 
Mitterrand's fete next month. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no competition between the two," insisted Chirac aide 
Thierry Aumonier. "It is a simple matter of protocol. It is the mayor of Paris 
who invites. President Mitterrand was not invited." 
</P>
<P>
Although the president was snubbed, Aumonier said Chirac did invite Minister of 
Culture Jack Lang, a Mitterrand ally, "who will be given a position of honor 
right next to Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
Each show has an eccentric director with his own ideas of how to celebrate 
history. Promoters for Chirac's Eiffel Tower party, directed by Olivier 
Massart, describe it as an event that "combines Jules Verne and Fellini -- an 
enormous naive event that mixes the wildest imagination with the glory of 
industrial performances. Living artists mix with enormous pictures on 
unpalpable screens." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's fete is more playful, reflecting the elfin personality of 
Jean-Paul Goude, a veteran American and French advertising man. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid," said Goude, "I always dreamed of putting on a show at the 
Theater of the Champs Elysees," a musical and dramatic theater near the famous 
boulevard. "Now they have offered me the whole Champs Elysees. How could I 
refuse?" 
</P>
<P>
Goude's show will also benefit from Mitterrand's position as commander-in-chief 
of the French military. In addition to 8,000 extras, 1,500 drummers and a 
90-foot steam-belching train engine with 20 men pounding on oil drums, 3,000 
French soldiers will join the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Director Massart, who seems to be benefiting mainly from Chirac's friendship 
with Reagan, will have 3,500 extras, 300 fashion models, 100 accordionists and 
20 international stars, ranging from French crooner Charles Aznavour to Stevie 
Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the rival shows has problems. The Chirac spectacle will be rudely 
interrupted by a commercial for Citroen, the French car maker. And Massart's 
decision to install a "Noah's Ark" sequence in the middle of a historical 
theme, which begins with the French Revolution, has left American television 
director Walter C. Miller puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this stuff I simply do not understand," said Miller, part of the 
American Radio City Music Hall team hired to hired to tape the show for 
international television. "We go from the French Revolution to Noah's Ark. It's 
just not chronological." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Tall for TV 
</P>
<P>
Another worry for Miller, a veteran of big spectacles who staged the 
inauguration of President Bush among other events, has to do with the tower 
itself. The 1,000-foot-high tower, constructed by French engineer Gustave 
Eiffel for the World's Fair of 1889, has a bad, as Miller put it in television 
terms "aspect ratio." In short, it is too tall for television. There is no way 
to show a performer and the tower at the same time. As a result, the performers 
will appear on the small screen as though they are set before a jungle-gym, not 
the whole magnificent iron-lace tribute to the dawn of the modern age. 
</P>
<P>
Goude, meanwhile, is beset by political problems. The Chinese portion of his 
"parade of planetary tribes" -- a giant drum pulled down the street by cyclists 
with dancers from the Beijing Opera and flailing martial artists, was canceled 
because of the recent political turmoil in China. Soviet officials objected to 
Goude's idea of having Kremlin guards goose-stepping down the street to African 
music while a ballerina danced with a bear. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens from Brittany refused to march in a Goude scene that they claimed made 
them look like comic strip characters. Their main objection appeared to be his 
proposal that they should wear traditional Brittany bigoudenes -- starched 
white head-dresses worn by women in the region -- but lit up with neon tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Parisians of all stripes are fed up with both political leaders for 
the inconvenience that their respective parties will cause drivers. For 
Chirac's fete tonight, a 6.2-square-mile area in the heart of Paris has been 
closed to all vehicular traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic restrictions will be even more severe for the Mitterrand Bicentennial 
events. Mitterrand has complicated his celebration by inviting the leaders of 
the world's other six richest industrial nations to hold their annual economic 
summit here. He also invited dozens of leaders from the world's poorest nations 
to meet with the rich nations' leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every leader will require a motorcade. Security will be intense. The 
Paris police chief has said he will mobilize 30,000 police, compared to only 
1,500 for the Chirac event. As a result, from July 10 to July 17, a huge 
section in the center of Paris, from the Bois de Boulogne in the west to the 
Louvre Museum in the east, will be closed to most traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Fumed Le Figaro, a Paris-based newspaper that supported Chirac and not 
Mitterrand in the presidential election last May: 
</P>
<P>
"Ten million Parisians and inhabitants of the suburbs are preparing to live a 
weeklong nightmare."

RURAL, SUBURBAN AREAS AMBUSH BIG-CITY SCHOOLS

<P>
Turning the tables on urban Democrats, a loosely knit coalition of legislators 
from the suburban and rural areas of the state exerted new-found muscle in the 
Assembly this week and won support for a Proposition 98 school funding package 
that left cities such as Los Angeles out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, announced Tuesday, ended an eight-day stalemate and led to Assembly 
passage of a nearly $50-billion version of the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
While legislators from both sides of the aisle warn about making too much of 
the vote, some lawmakers are calling the deal "historic" because -- if Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the Senate agree -- it will free up hundreds of millions 
for money-starved suburban and rural schools by directing money away from urban 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the new money, roughly $1.4 billion over two budget years, being 
generated for schools by the landmark school funding initiative Proposition 98, 
which was approved by voters last Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly plan to implement Proposition 98, to be amended into a long-term 
school funding bill, was unusual in that it bypassed the Education and Budget 
committees controlled by big-city Democrats. That was possible because Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) set up a special team of negotiators to 
draft the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Once agreed upon by the special team, the plan was informally ratified in a 
budget vote marked by a rare bipartisan alliance. Casting "no" votes were such 
members of the urban Los Angeles delegation as Terry B. Friedman, Teresa P. 
Hughes, Richard Katz, Burt Margolin, Lucille Roybal-Allard and Maxine Waters, 
all of whom could normally be counted on to vote for a budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, expressing concerns shared by other members of the Los Angeles 
delegation, said he refused to vote for the budget because he believed that the 
school aid package was "vindictive" and "a purposeful effort to get L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Hughes, the chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, which 
was bypassed by the negotiators who put together the plan, said: "I'm not very 
pleased. Los Angeles is really getting worked over." 
</P>
<P>
But while the Los Angeles Democrats were crying foul, normally powerless 
legislators from Orange County, suburban cities such as Glendale and rural and 
farming communities in California's Central Valley were praising the vote as 
"historic" because it recognized for the first time in recent years that school 
finance was out of kilter, with big-city schools drawing most of the dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), noting that Orange County schools will 
get more than $69 million as a result of the agreement, called it a "foundation 
for fairness" for future education funding. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who played a leading role in putting the 
deal together, said Republicans for years have complained that fast-growing 
suburban and rural communities were being shortchanged in the annual division 
by political leaders of the roughly $15 billion a year the state gives to 
school districts. Because they had no hard numbers to back up their contention, 
two years ago Republicans ordered a study of education expenditures. This year, 
they got their first report. 
</P>
<P>
What the study showed was that when all the various special state financial aid 
programs were added up, the Los Angeles Unified School District was receiving 
$1,045 per pupil, San Jose Unified was getting $1,346 for each student, and San 
Francisco, Oakland and San Diego were getting $934, $810 and $702 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cries of Outrage 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers led to cries of outrage when lawmakers compared them to much 
lower figures for school districts outside the big cities. For example, in Los 
Angeles County, Alhambra schools were receiving $232 per pupil, while each 
student in Glendale was being backed by $192 in state dollars. Elsewhere, 
Fresno was receiving $432 per pupil; Riverside, $277; Sacramento, $442, and 
Chula Vista, in San Diego County, $293 per student. 
</P>
<P>
"When we totaled the figures up, it confirmed what we had felt all along was 
happening. In fact, the disparities were far worse than we had thought," Nolan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the question of fairness, Republicans also had the law on their 
side. In 1971, the California Supreme Court in a landmark decision ruled that 
the state's system of financing public education was illegal because there was 
a huge disparity in funding between rich and poor school districts. As a result 
of the ruling, the Legislature enacted a series of laws designed to bring about 
equality in funding, but the figures turned up by Assembly Republicans showed 
that a huge gap still existed. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to the issue give many reasons for the disparities in funding. 
</P>
<P>
State funding for schools is done in a variety of ways, from unrestricted 
financial aid based solely on the number of students in each district to grants 
made in support of more than 50 different special programs, each one designed 
to meet different needs. 
</P>
<P>
Separate financial aid programs were created to provide extra assistance to 
gifted students, slow learners and poor readers. Others, with a broader sweep, 
were put together to provide extra financial aid to school districts with major 
problems, such as those under court order to desegregate or those that have 
large concentrations of poor and foreign-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School district, by far the largest school district in 
the state, got in on the ground floor of all of the programs and was a magnet, 
pulling in money for just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for other districts was that as a result of a series of lean state 
budgets in the 1980s, little new money was added to finance the special 
programs. Those districts already receiving the aid continued to get the money, 
but schools in newly emerging areas of the state basically were shut out. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona), in an emotional appeal to Democrats on 
the floor of the Assembly, complained that "kids from identical circumstances 
receive a fraction of support that other kids receive. . . . It isn't fair. It 
isn't right. It's not educationally sound." 
</P>
<P>
Helping to galvanize the legislators was the lucrative wage settlement the Los 
Angeles Unified School District recently gave its teachers. The generous 
settlement, which will boost teacher wages by 24% by 1990, rankled numerous 
legislators, who complained that other districts could not afford to pay their 
teachers as well, even though housing prices and living expenses in Glendale, 
Alhambra and other communities are comparable to those in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The financing plan promoted by Republicans would take away some of the money 
that would have helped Los Angeles meet its new payroll, but legislators insist 
that the district will still get enough to finance the strike settlement 
package. 
</P>
<P>
(Even though Los Angeles Unified, with nearly 600,000 students, will get less 
than most other districts on an average per-pupil basis, it would still get a 
lump sum payment of $50.7 million under the equalization plan. By contrast, 
Orange County's 28 school districts, with 348,000 students, would split a total 
of $69.4 million. On top of that, school districts statewide would divide 
another $521 million in unrestricted funds that they could spend for such 
things as payroll during the current and upcoming budget years.) 
</P>
<P>
Even though Nolan, Bader and other Republicans had obvious sympathy from 
Democrats who represent similar suburban and agricultural districts, the GOP 
legislators got nowhere until they took the extraordinary action of refusing to 
vote for the proposed state budget when it came up for a procedural vote June 
5. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was an eight-day stalemate during which Republicans circulated 
computer printouts comparing education funding district by district. The 
disparities in funding cut across party lines. Democrats in suburban and rural 
communities saw that the school districts they represented were as bad off as 
districts represented by their GOP counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said: "We found that money was being unfairly channeled to certain large 
districts at the expense of students around the rest of the state. The 
printouts sent shock waves through the Democratic Caucus." 
</P>
<P>
Normal Democratic team players such as Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton) were incensed. When negotiators came up with a plan to help rural 
and suburban districts, Johnston said he did not have any sympathy for Los 
Angeles because "they've pigged out so much over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos), who once led an informal coalition of 
rural legislators that was organized to get a better deal for farming 
communities, said, "The rural and suburban districts have really been getting 
screwed over." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the stalemate, a negotiating team of four lawmakers from each 
party was formed to come up with a plan. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement that came together is designed to make school funding more equal 
than it has been by directing a disproportionate share of Proposition 98 funds 
to school districts that are now receiving less than others. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Los Angeles Unified School District's share of the new money 
would amount to $86 per pupil. Oakland would get $93 per student; San Francisco 
$109; San Diego $146 and San Jose $177. The statewide average would be $155 per 
student. But many districts would receive more than that, with the Anaheim 
Union High School District targeted for $266 per pupil; Glendale Unified, $223; 
Lancaster Elementary, $267, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
On a countywide basis, Los Angeles County schools would receive an average of 
$130 per student when the Proposition 98 pie is divided up, while other 
Southern California counties would get a split of the money, on a per-pupil 
basis, this way: Orange County, $199; San Diego, $180; Santa Barbara, $173; 
Riverside, $165; Ventura, $198; Imperial, $217, and Kern, $139. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, when all the state dollars are counted, big-city school districts such 
as Los Angeles would still be receiving hundreds of dollars more per pupil. But 
the Proposition 98 plan would move the "have-nots" much closer to the "haves," 
according to Nolan. "We won't be at equal dollars per student, but this is a 
major step forward. The commitment is that over the next three years we will 
move the bottom-level districts up to the statewide average. That's a historic 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan and other lawmakers say they do not see broader political implications 
from the alliance of Republicans and Democrats that came together on the 
proposed Proposition 98 funding plan. They do not see the same Republicans and 
Democrats forming a bloc that could be counted on to pass other major bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason it worked this time is that we had so much new money to spend. We 
had a chance to correct things. Some schools get a hell of a lot more money 
than others. The goal was to make expenditures per child more equal. That's 
it," Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) said. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one rural Democrat, Areias, believes that the vote was the first 
of many to come that reflects changing demographics in California. He points to 
the rapid population growth in suburban and rural regions of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Finance, in a recent report, said it expects 5 million 
new households to be formed in California by the year 2020. And with little 
land left in central cities, most of the growth is expected to be in new 
suburbs and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
Areias, one of the so-called Gang of Five rebellious Democrats who last year 
tried to topple Speaker Brown, said: 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is an indication of the political clout that is moving into the 
suburban and rural areas. When we reapportion after the 1990 census, rural and 
suburban areas are going to get more representation and inner cities are going 
to lose political power."

The Soviet Union admitted for the first time Friday that a tank of radioactive 
waste exploded at a nuclear weapons plant nearly 32 years ago, showering 
particles over about 400 square miles and forcing the evacuation of 10,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Chernobyl power plant explosion on April 26, 1986, Western 
specialists called the disaster in the southern Ural Mountains the world's 
worst nuclear accident. A secret CIA file made public in 1977 quoted Soviet 
sources as saying hundreds of people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The Western accounts said the explosion created a vast radioactive wasteland 
one-third the land area of Rhode Island, or about 400 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty rural villages vanished from Soviet maps, fishing was banned in lakes, 
dams were built to contain radioactive waterways and rivers were diverted with 
canals, according to the Western accounts. 
</P>
<P>
But the official news agency Tass said Friday that no casualties had resulted. 
It quoted Boris Nikipelov, first deputy minister for medium machine-building, 
as telling a news conference a "chemical explosion" occurred in September, 
1957, near Kasli, about 870 miles southeast of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A tank of radioactive waste exploded at a military plant where atomic weapons 
were to be built, "forming a radioactive trail 105 kilometers (65 miles) long 
and 8 to 9 kilometers (roughly 5 to 5 1/2 miles) wide," said Nikipelov, whose 
ministry administers military-related nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said 2 million curies of radioactive elements were released and that "more 
than 10,000 people were urgently evacuated from the contaminated zone." In 
comparison, Tass noted that 50 million curies of radiation were released in the 
Chernobyl explosion and fire that resulted in the death of 31 people. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the accident lasted for decades, Tass indicated. It said 
economic activity resumed in the area only by 1978, and even then only in 80% 
of the contaminated zone. The remaining territory was turned into a reserve. 
Radiation returned to safe levels in the area only by 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Tass did not say when or where Nikipelov gave the news conference, nor did it 
say which radioactive particles were released or whether the atomic weapons 
plant is still operating. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the accident was kept secret so long in the Soviet Union because it 
occurred at a military plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Urals accident was first disclosed in 1972, when Zhores Medvedev, a Soviet 
biochemist, wrote that hundreds of people probably died of radioactive 
poisoning after nuclear wastes near the first Soviet atomic power plants 
exploded.

GORBACHEV'S VISIT SURPASSES BONN'S HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Grobachev to West Germany surpassed 
the West German government's fondest hopes for success. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the four days of high-level talks and lower-level glad-handing 
strengthen the ties between Bonn and Moscow, analysts agreed Friday, but it 
boosted West Germany's position within the Western Alliance as a major partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow &amp; Bonn -- Complete Success," crowed the newspaper Cologne Anzeiger. 
And the Bonn newspaper General-Anzeiger added: "Bonn Draws Positive Balance." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave a glowing report of the visit to the West German 
Parliament on Friday. He said Gorbachev told him that the conventional arms 
talks in Vienna could be successfully completed by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev further said that such an agreement could be implemented a couple of 
years after that. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl told Parliament that Gorbachev "shared my opinion that the deadlines set 
by President Bush -- first agreement in six to 12 months and its implementation 
by 1992-93 -- are quite attainable if both sides work at it. We must keep this 
goal in view." 
</P>
<P>
But the main result of the visit, in West German eyes, was to place the nation 
in a new role: that of a kind of go-between with Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
As Claus Gennrich commented in the right-of-center newspaper Frankfurter 
Allgemeine: "Gorbachev and Kohl managed to achieve what each of them urgently 
needs: a foreign policy success." 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, several commentators argued, is "moving up to the rank of partner 
in leadership with Washington and Moscow," as one put it, adding, "although 
this does not make it a hinge between West and East, it makes it the basis for 
Western influence on Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Even Kohl's political opponents, the Social Democrats, congratulated the 
chancellor for his talks with Gorbachev. A veteran member of the opposition, 
former Chancellor Willy Brandt, said that Gorbachev's trip was "a success for 
the federal government, which we applaud." 
</P>
<P>
In determining how much credit Kohl and the ruling coalition will accrue from 
the Gorbachev visit, the first formal public reaction may come Sunday when the 
West German electorate votes for members of the European Parliament -- and, 
perhaps more important, for local offices in two states: Kohl's own 
Rhineland-Palatinate, and the industrially depressed Saarland. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl hopes recent foreign policy successes -- the favorable outcome of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Brussels last month, President 
Bush's visit, and now the enormous outpouring of public support for Gorbachev 
-- will reverse his falling popularity at the political box office. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Kohl and his Christian Democratic-Free Democratic coalition do 
badly Sunday, the new cordiality in Bonn-Moscow relations may give him time to 
improve his standing with the voters before the general election in December 
1990.

BETTER LIFE SEEN AS SOLE BAR TO SOVIET UNREST

<P>
The Soviet Union faces major political and social unrest on a broad scale 
within the next two years unless living standards are boosted quickly, the 
government's top economist warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid I. Abalkin, who was appointed deputy premier for economic policy a week 
ago, said that the government is quickly running out of time and that its 
policies have so far failed to halt the deepening crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Should the government's new efforts also fail, he added in one of the most 
sober warnings here yet on the economic crisis, a sharp political swing to the 
right could result and bring an end to perestroika, as the current reform 
program is known. 
</P>
<P>
"Our studies show clearly that if the economy is not stabilized over the next 
year or two and at least the start of an improvement is not achieved, a 
rightward swing by society is inevitable," Abalkin said at a press conference 
at the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Something Unpredictable' 
</P>
<P>
"Society will be destabilized. The estimate, again, is one to two years at a 
maximum, and then something unpredictable will begin. The form (of the 
upheaval) is unpredictable, but it will be inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Abalkin, director of the prestigious institute and an adviser to President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was joined in his warning by other leading economists and 
social scientists, whose break from normal caution and their joint press 
conference underscored their growing fear that the country may not find its way 
out of the crisis and that Gorbachev's program of perestroika will be the first 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
Oleg T. Bogomolov, director of the Institute of Economics and World Socialist 
Systems, another key Kremlin think tank, said that even the new measures 
outlined by Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov at the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the new national assembly, appear inadequate to resolve both 
the specific economic problems -- the shortages of food and consumer goods, 
inflation, a huge budget deficit, over-investment -- and to correct the 
structural flaws in an economy that largely remains centrally planned and 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
"Economists are demanding more radical measures," Bogomolov said. "There seem 
to be no concrete proposals to get out of the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famine Warning 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Tikhonov, a leading agronomist, went further, warning of an impending 
famine if radical agricultural reforms, based on the return of land to the 
farmers as promised by the Communist Party, are not implemented quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that if radical transformations are not undertaken next year there 
will be a famine awaiting us," Tikhonov said, noting that the Soviet Union has 
now been forced even to import potatoes to feed its people, although it has 
vast acreage available for planting a larger crop. 
</P>
<P>
Poor foreign currency earnings may force a substantial reduction in Soviet 
imports of meat, vegetables, fruit and grain, Tikhonov said, and this would 
mean an even worse "food problem," as the government calls the already severe 
shortages of most foods. 
</P>
<P>
"Administrators are responsible for this crisis," Tikhonov said, insisting that 
the country must move to a market system if Soviet farmers are ever to be able 
to feed the nation. 
</P>
<P>
While Abalkin and Bogomolov said they thought Tikhonov might have exaggerated 
the dimensions of the country's agricultural problems in warning of a famine, 
they agreed that the radical economic reforms they believe are needed must 
start with the decollectivization of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
To raise living standards, Abalkin said, the government must cut back sharply 
on state investments and transfer the funds to increased supplies of consumer 
goods. All unprofitable state enterprises must be closed by 1991. And the 
government's budget deficit, now estimated at equivalent of more than $165 
billion a year, must be reduced radically before it fuels inflation beyond the 
point of control.

BUSH, AIDES WEIGHING SHIFTS IN STANCE AT ARMS TALKS

Bush Administration negotiators will resume superpower talks on strategic arms 
reductions in Geneva on Monday, six months after the talks recessed due to the 
change in U.S. administrations, with only "relatively minor" alterations in the 
position inherited from the Reagan Administration, White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, President Bush and his chief advisers will spend the weekend at Camp 
David discussing possible major new modifications to the U.S. proposal, 
probably on whether mobile land-based intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) should 
be permitted under a strategic arms treaty, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
If they come up with any significant changes in policy, they would seek 
approval from key congressmen first before revealing them and cabling them to 
negotiators by Wednesday when the first formal plenary session for the 
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks is scheduled. A new proposal would enable the 
Administration to hold on to its new-found momentum in the U.S.-Soviet 
competition for arms control initiatives, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congressional Commitments 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official indicated that congressional commitments will have 
to be substantive before the Administration will agree to significant 
modifications of its positions on mobile missiles, however. What kind of 
commitments the Administration would want was left unstated. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also wants to test in advance a system for verifying any 
limits on mobile missiles, to ensure that an agreement can be effectively 
policed, the Defense Department official said. Whether this concept is 
sufficiently advanced to be presented to the Soviet negotiators in Geneva was 
not clear, however; nor is its acceptability to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
While the idea has "some panache," one source said, it does not address any of 
the major issues still outstanding in the START negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be very little here in the end or it may be a big deal," a 
knowledgeable State Department official said of the Administration 
deliberations on the new talks due to get under way Monday. "It is most 
important to get new positions which will be supported in Congress and then 
reinforce them by having them reflected in our negotiating stance, rather than 
adopt new positions which do not have a strong domestic base." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Embarrassing' Prospect 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, another official remarked, "It will be embarrassing to go back to 
Geneva after six months and tell the Soviets we 'reserve' our position on the 
most important items" -- meaning the United States has nothing to say, at least 
for the time being. "We're going to look rather foolish." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet chief negotiator Yuri K. Nazarkin, upon arriving in Geneva on Friday, 
said the long break in negotiations was "plausible" because of the change in 
U.S. presidents. "But the facts are here, much time has passed and the 
negotiations must be marked by intense and hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Nazarkin said he did not come "empty handed," although the consensus is that 
the ball is in the U.S. court because Washington asked for the prolonged delay 
in the talks in order to conduct a reassessment of its global strategic 
posture, including its arms control positions. 
</P>
<P>
He and the chief U.S. negotiator, Richard R. Burt, will meet briefly Monday to 
discuss negotiating procedures, according to U.S. officials, with the first 
formal session involving the entire teams scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said "a number of decisions" affecting instructions for U.S. 
negotiators had been made, but that Bush "will continue to make decisions . . . 
and provide them to our Geneva representatives on an ongoing basis." 
</P>
<P>
"The changes that we'll begin with on Monday will be relatively minor," he 
added, "but we do reserve the right to review these matters and make changes on 
an ongoing basis. The question of mobile missiles is one that was not resolved 
before. Sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) is another very difficult (issue). 
. . . These could be changed later but it's unlikely that we will have changes 
in the first sessions." 
</P>
<P>
An agreement on reducing strategic, long-range weapons was largely completed 
during the final Reagan years. About 400 pages of a joint draft text commit 
both sides to reduce their nuclear offensive arsenals by about 50% to equal 
ceilings of 6,000 warheads and cruise missiles. They may be carried on no more 
than 1,600 "delivery systems" -- that is, missiles and bombers. 
</P>
<P>
About five major issues remain and threaten to delay completion of an accord 
well into next year or even later. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among them is the issue of mobile land-based missiles. The United States' 
current proposal is to ban such weapons, but it may be changed.

A U.S. official said Friday that more Chinese diplomats had defected in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking to reporters on grounds he not be identified, said the 
Chinese diplomats had joined two who defected in San Francisco this week, as 
well as a number of Chinese officials in other countries who have sought 
sanctuary since the government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the Chinese officials were not immediately disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, quoting unofficial sources, said two members of the 
Chinese Embassy in Washington had asked for U.S. protection. It identified them 
as Zhang Chiwei, a third secretary in the embassy's press section, and his 
wife, Han Guohong, the embassy's protocol officer.

2 Defect in San Francisco

Two Chinese diplomats in San Francisco -- Vice Consul Zhou Liming and staff

</P>
<P>
The Canadian government said a number of Chinese diplomatic personnel are in 
the process of defecting to Canada but remained tight-lipped about details. 
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that there have been approaches by some officials of the Chinese 
Embassy indicating a desire to stay in Canada," External Affairs Minister Joe 
Clark told reporters outside the House of Commons in Ottawa.

U.S. HOPES FOR PAPANDREOU DEFEAT -- BUT NOT OUT LOUD 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration would dearly like to see Greece's Socialist government 
voted out of office this Sunday -- but it's afraid to say so out loud. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't be telling you this," a State Department official said, assuming a 
furtive look and dropping his voice -- "but we'd love to see Papandreou go." 
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has been a thorn in Washington's side 
ever since he was first elected eight years ago. He has campaigned against 
Greece's membership in NATO, frequently charged U.S. interference in Greek 
affairs and promised to deprive the United States of its military bases in his 
country -- without ever quite following through. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, U.S. officials complain, Papandreou has turned Greece into a 
virtual haven for Arab and European terrorists. For years, they charge, the 
Greek prime minister accepted "substantial contributions" from Libyan leader 
Moammar Kadafi -- and, in return, turned a blind eye to the operations of 
Libyan agents in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou has denied the charge and U.S. officials say their intelligence 
suggests that the payments from Kadafi have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terror Suspect Released 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Greece released a Palestinian who was wanted in Italy for a bloody 
attack on a Rome synagogue in which a 2-year-old child was killed. Papandreou's 
minister for justice contended that the man's actions had been part of "the 
struggle to regain the independence of his homeland." Administration officials 
accuse Athens of delaying the extradition of another Palestinian wanted in the 
United States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jet that killed one passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's opponent in the election, Constantine Mitsotakis, has promised to 
shift Greece's foreign policy back toward the United States. Mitsotakis has 
said he wants Greece to remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, wants 
to keep U.S. bases in Greece and wants to crack down on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, has the United States been so quiet about the election? 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid of tipping things the wrong way," said a Pentagon official. "Any 
time you try to influence a foreign election, you usually create a backlash and 
you end up with a net loss." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He May Pull It Off' 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said a State Department official, "Why alienate Papandreou? He may 
pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the Administration has bent over backward to appear unruffled by 
the prospect of another Papandreou government. President Bush appeared with the 
Greek prime minister in a "photo opportunity" at the NATO summit in Brussels 
last month; Papandreou used the photograph in his campaign to reassure centrist 
voters that he wasn't so anti-American after all. And the State Department has 
expressed confidence that relations with Greece are improving. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't stopped both sides in the Greek campaign from attacking the United 
States occasionally. Papandreou has continued to campaign against "foreign 
interference," which in Athens means Washington. Oddly enough, the opposition 
has accused U.S. Ambassador Robert V. Keeley of trying secretly to help 
Papandreou by telling a reporter that he was unimpressed by Mitsotakis; Keeley 
has denied saying any such thing. 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement with only 36% 
of the probable vote, well behind Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy Party 
with 47%. 
</P>
<P>
But neither party may win a majority in Parliament, an outcome that could be 
the most troublesome of all from the Administration's standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
If both parties fall short of a majority, Papandreou could try to form a 
coalition with the Greek Communist Party and other leftist groups -- giving 
Greece a regime that could be the most leftist government ever seen within the 
NATO alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting situation, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State M. James Wilkinson 
recently told a congressional committee with some understatement, would be 
"difficult."

PAPANDREOU DECREE FINAL; WAY CLEARED FOR HIS REMARRIAGE

Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, whose tangled love life has become the 
best-watched soap opera in Greece, finally got his divorce Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old prime minister can now go ahead with plans to marry former 
Olympic Airways flight attendant Dimitra Liani, 35, who has acted as Greece's 
unofficial first lady for the past 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's bitter public argument with his American-born wife, Margaret, has 
been splashed across newspaper front pages for months and is a favorite theme 
in satirical cabaret skits. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the unhappy couple officially renounced their rights to contest a 
June 9 divorce decree by an Athens court, making the divorce final, lawyers for 
both parties told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A public prosecutor will notify the Greek Orthodox Church, which will dissolve 
the marriage spiritually. Papandreou can marry twice-divorced Liani in a civil 
ceremony now, but she wants a church wedding. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second divorce for both Papandreou and his wife. They were married 
in 1951 in the United States and have four children, including Education 
Minister George Papandreou.

BROWN APPEALS TO GOP TO HELP DRAFT CODE OF CONDUCT

Declaring that both political parties "have a moral obligation" to clean up 
American politics, Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown on Friday called on 
his Republican counterpart, Lee Atwater, to join him in drafting guidelines to 
govern the conduct of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
With his statement, Brown appeared to be trying to seize the initiative on the 
issue of ethics, which Republican strategists have been planning to use to cut 
into the Democratic majorities in Congress, particularly the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's assertion that "voters are sick and tired of attacks, dirty tricks, 
phony phone banks and rumormongers" was issued at a national strategy session 
here for Democratic state chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refers to China 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot remember a time when it has been more dispiriting to be called a 
political professional," Brown said. Referring to the dissent and violence in 
China, he declared: "When students are willing to die in Tian An Men Square for 
democracy, we have a moral obligation to raise the standard of conduct in 
American politics." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, presiding over the Republican National Committee's spring meeting 
Friday in Washington, did not respond directly to Brown's proposal to meet. 
Instead, he promised to send Brown a copy of Bush's ethics recommendations, 
issued in April, which called for more stringent financial disclosure by 
federal officials and restrictions on lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is in agreement (with Bush)," Atwater said, "then we may indeed have a 
need to sit down and discuss the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's statement came in the wake of a series of controversies over the uses 
and abuses of political power. Two top Democratic congressional leaders -- 
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and Democratic House Whip Tony Coelho of 
Merced -- have resigned after charges of abuse of office, while, on the other 
hand, prominent Republicans, including President Bush, have been forced to 
denounce some of the tactics used by the GOP against the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying these controversies was the GOP battle plan, which called the Wright 
and Coelho cases evidence of a moral corruption stemming from the long-term 
Democratic domination of the House. Some GOP strategists had coined the term 
"imperial Congress" to dramatize their case. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has outraged some Democrats. "They are trying to poison the 
atmosphere up on (Capitol Hill) so that a lot of people will just decide it's 
easier to stay home than stay in Congress," said Richard Moe, a veteran 
Democratic strategist. 
</P>
<P>
But then last week the Republicans made themselves victims of their own zeal, 
when a memo was circulated bearing the imprimatur of the Republican National 
Committee. It seemed to imply that Rep. Thomas S. Foley, chosen by the 
Democrats to replace Wright as Speaker, was a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
Foley immediately denied the charge. But the memo caused such shock waves among 
members of both parties that the national committee staffer who supposedly 
authored it resigned, Atwater apologized to Foley, Bush pronounced himself 
"disgusted" with the memo and reportedly rebuked Atwater and Brown and other 
Democrats demanded Atwater's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the GOP attack has been blunted. The Republicans have been notably 
silent about the controversy over the award of a lucrative contract for 
operating a gift shop at Los Angeles International Airport to Betty Dixon, wife 
of Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Ethics 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did Not Meet Requirement 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's wife was awarded the contract under a government-run program to help 
minorities and women in business, even though it is alleged that she did not 
meet the program's requirement for hands-on management of the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have "no stomach" for going after Dixon right now, one normally 
aggressive GOP tactician told a reporter. Another explained: "We're in a period 
of conciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Atwater has become a favored target of Democrats. A memo prepared by 
Democratic National Committee staffers and distributed at the Nashville meeting 
praised party officials in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and New Jersey for 
having done "a great job" in helping generate publicity "about Atwater's smear 
tactics" in their states. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater won a vote of confidence from the Republican National Committee Friday 
for his "aggressive" leadership, which the confidence resolution said had made 
him "the target of unremitting attacks from Democrats and their surrogates." 
</P>
<P>
But in his remarks to the RNC Friday, Atwater avoided the sort of slashing 
partisan attack that has been his hallmark, and he, instead, accentuated the 
positive, pledging to help the Republican Party achieve majority status in the 
next 10 years through intensive grass-roots campaign work.

U.S. TO DEPORT CHILEAN TIED TO TERRORISM

Under pressure from Australia and Sweden, the United States decided Friday to 
release Sergio Buschmann, an accused Chilean terrorist detained in Alaska, 
diplomatic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached after an international tug of war that had become a 
major political issue in Chile, Australia and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Buschmann is accused of being involved in smuggling 70 tons of Soviet-made 
weapons into Chile in 1986. He escaped from a Chilean prison the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Buschmann, a member of the Manuel Rodruiguez Front, a left-wing underground 
group, later told television interviewers that he would do his best to 
overthrow any Chilean government, even a democratic one that might emerge in 
the scheduled December elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Status in Sweden 
</P>
<P>
Initially detained in Australia, Buschmann was ordered by immigration officials 
there to be deported to Sweden, where he had refugee status. He had a U.N. 
refugee passport. 
</P>
<P>
When his flight to Sweden stopped to refuel in Anchorage, Buschmann was spotted 
by officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who saw his name on 
an Interpol watch list. He was taken off the plane and put into "preventive 
detention" while the U.S. government decided whether to honor a Chilean request 
to extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
Both Australia and Sweden objected to the U.S. action. The Swedish government 
contended that Buschmann's detention violated the Geneva Convention of 1951, 
which protects political refugees from deportation or extradition for political 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites U.S. Promises 
</P>
<P>
Chile argued that U.S. promises about fighting terrorism meant he should be 
deported. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Chile, Australia and the State Department confirmed that the State 
Department made a decision late Friday to permit Buschmann to board the next 
plane that would take him to Sweden. 
</P>

Complicating the decision was the continuing demand by the United States that 
Chile extradite two former Chilean officials who had been implicated in the 
bombing death of Orlando Letelier and Ronnie Moffett in Washington in 1976.

U.S. VOWS TO LIFT 30-YEAR VEIL OF SECRECY AT WEAPONS PLANTS

Facing a massive criminal investigation at its Rocky Flats facility, the 
Department of Energy vowed Friday to end more than 30 years of secrecy and 
silence cloaking its nuclear weapon plants and to place "environment, safety 
and public health" above production concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of Energy Henson Moore refused to discuss specific allegations 
of wrongdoing at Rocky Flats, but announced a $1.8-million plan to beef up 
monitoring and oversight at the plutonium-trigger-making facility 16 miles 
northwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot operate these plants as we have in the past," Moore told a joint 
news conference at the state Capitol with Gov. Roy Romer. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also said the Energy Department shuffled top management at Rocky Flats 
and sent a stern letter explaining "this change in philosophy" to its 
contractor, Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's regular "award fee" of "$4- to $5 million" also was being withheld 
for the six-month period ending in March, Moore said. The DOE has routinely 
paid Rockwell millions of dollars in performance bonuses over the last 14 years 
despite the department's own ranking of Rocky Flats as the most dangerously 
contaminated site in the nation's nuclear weapons complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aerial Surveys 
</P>
<P>
The DOE also said that next month it will begin aerial surveys of Rocky Flats 
"to obtain background radiation levels for the entire area to identify any 
possible health or safety hazard." 
</P>
<P>
The move appeared to be in response to FBI allegations that hazardous waste was 
illegally burned at Rocky Flats late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, which Romer said was hammered out at 2:30 a.m. Friday, gives 
state health officials better access to top-secret areas of Rocky Flats and 
more extensive methods to monitor the air, soil and water for contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Among the steps taken was shutting down the incinerator under FBI investigation 
until state inspectors are satisfied that waste is being burned both legally 
and safely. 
</P>
<P>
"These plants were built in the 1950s and the philosophy was this is a secret 
operation, not subject to any laws by the state," Moore said. The pervasive 
attitude, he said, was "just butt out." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will be kept secret with regard to environment," the DOE asserted in a 
written statement released at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging agreement with the state, similar to one at the Savannah River 
nuclear facility in South Carolina, apparently was struck to quell public 
outrage and demands that Rocky Flats be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Moore reiterated that the FBI and Environmental Protection Agency search of 
Rocky Flats, which is still under way, as well as an internal DOE 
investigation, has turned up no evidence of any "imminent danger" to public 
health or safety. Approximately 2 million people live within a 50-mile radius 
of Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
A 116-page affidavit filed by the FBI to support its request for search 
warrants at the plant accused the Department of Energy and Rockwell of 
illegally dumping and burning hazardous waste and then lying to cover up the 
environmental violations. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said exotic, toxic chemicals were dumped into two creeks leading 
to the drinking water supplies of 285,000 citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But, "tests show absolutely clean, drinkable water," Romer said. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 100 federal agents raided Rocky Flats on June 6, Romer angrily 
declared that he would close the federal facility at the first sign of any 
threat to public health or safety. It is not clear whether the governor has 
that authority when issues of national security and defense come into play. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-page letter to Rockwell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Donald 
Beall, Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins said "any surreptitious actions" to 
dodge environmental laws and regulations "cannot be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins admitted dissatisfaction with management of Rocky Flats. "As a result, 
I have effected significant management changes there and expect that others 
will follow after my team completes its review." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins replaced the top DOE manager at Rocky Flats, Rush Inlow, on the morning 
of the raid. Inlow returned to DOE operations offices in Albuquerque, which 
normally has jurisdiction over Rocky Flats. 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, Albuquerque has been removed from the chain of 
command, Moore said, with Rocky Flats reporting directly to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Watkins also warned that Rockwell would be in breach of contract 
if "any incinerator, designed and constructed for the purpose of reclaiming 
special nuclear material, were instead used intentionally as an expedient means 
for disposal of hazardous waste, a function for which such incinerators are 
neither designed nor permitted to carry out." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins demanded that Rockwell submit a plan within 60 days to prevent 
"management shortcomings."

COMMITTEE TO BEGIN PUBLIC VOTES ON SENATORS' BENEFITS 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Rules Committee, meeting behind closed doors, agreed Friday to adopt 
a new policy of voting in public when they decide to spend taxpayers' money on 
personal benefits for themselves or their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the powerful committee will hold open meetings when discussing 
such issues as increasing senators' health benefits, buying them insurance or 
hiking their car allowances, said Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), who also serves as chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said the five-member panel's decision reflected the desire on its part 
to resolve "what we think are the reasonable concerns of the public and the 
news media." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times documented how members of both the Senate and the 
Assembly met in private to vote lawmakers at least $1 million in benefits such 
as life insurance, airline tickets, car telephones and increases in senators' 
car allowances. 
</P>
<P>
Some press organizations have called for changes in legislative rules to 
prohibit the Legislature from making such decisions in private. 
</P>
<P>
The rules change adopted by the Senate will take effect immediately but will 
not affect the Assembly, which operates under its own rules. 
</P>
<P>
However, members of the Assembly are considering a similar rules change for the 
lower house, said Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly 
Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new Senate policy, the Rules Committee will begin meeting in public 
to vote on: 
</P>
<P>
* Changes in the medical, dental and insurance plans or similar benefits 
provided to senators and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
* Adjustments to the senators' car allowance, which is set at $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
* Decisions to award Senate research contracts to outside groups. 
</P>
<P>
* Cost-of-living salary increases for Senate employees. 
</P>
<P>
* The appointment of chairmen and members to the committees of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the new policy, however, some decisions involving legislators' perks 
may still be made behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
The Rules Committee will continue meeting in private to discuss questions 
involving "internal management" of the Senate, Roberti said. However, such 
closed-door decisions must be disclosed in a written summary within 30 days 
under the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost of Air Fare 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Rules Committee voted to pay the cost of air fare for 
weekly trips by senators back to their districts -- a decision that has cost at 
least $134,000 since 1987. Under the new policy, a decision to increase air 
travel payments could still be made in private but would be made public within 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will also keep holding closed sessions on such matters as pending 
litigation, personnel decisions and security questions, and, under the new 
policy, will not necessarily have to make its decisions public. 
</P>
<P>
Under this provision, the panel could still vote in private whether to use 
state money to pay the cost of a lawsuit filed by a member of the Senate. Last 
year, the committee voted privately to finance a suit filed by four Democratic 
senators challenging Proposition 73, the campaign finance initiative approved 
by voters. The committee's decision so far has cost the taxpayers at least 
$80,000.

GOVERNOR ASSAILS U.S. DELAYS OF DEATH CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday assailed long delays in resolving capital 
cases and urged that federal judges curtail reviews of constitutional 
challenges to death sentences already upheld in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal courts should accept these petitions as seldom as is necessary," said 
Deukmejian, appearing at a hearing on behalf of the National Governors Assn. 
"If there has been a full and fair adjudication of the issues in state courts, 
they should accept that." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said that delay in reviewing appeals prevents capital punishment 
from serving as an effective deterrent to crime and enables criminals to "thumb 
their noses at the law," knowing that even if they are caught, they still can 
avoid paying the full price. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian testified before a special task force of judges and other legal 
authorities that is studying time-consuming delay, repetitive appeals, court 
congestion and other problems that critics say are plaguing federal 
constitutional challenges in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Such challenges are made in federal habeas corpus petitions that are filed 
after a defendant's conviction and sentence have been upheld in state courts. 
The petitions are restricted to claims of violation of federal constitutional 
rights, but the ability to file them has been substantially expanded by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. Currently, about 9,500 federal habeas 
corpus petitions are being filed annually in the United States, an estimated 5% 
of them in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member panel, sponsored by the American Bar Assn. and co-chaired by 
California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, is receiving testimony from 
prosecutors, defense attorneys and officials in a series of nationwide 
hearings. The panel began two days of proceedings here at a time when there is 
growing concern among judges, lawyers and other authorities over the prospect 
of long delays in the review of California capital cases in the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court under Lucas has sharply accelerated its review of 
death-penalty cases, upholding 54 capital sentences in just two years. But the 
death verdicts upheld by the state court are being challenged further in what 
officials expect will be a wave of constitutional appeals in the federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and other witnesses cited as an example of their concern the case of 
Robert Alton Harris, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders 
of two youths in San Diego in 1978. His is the furthest along of any California 
capital case now in the federal court system and has been before federal judges 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' conviction and sentence were upheld in separate appeals by the state 
Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and, last July, by the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. But his subsequent petition for a rehearing before the 
federal appellate court is pending -- nearly a full year later. 
</P>
<P>
The governor urged the panelists to seek reforms in the process that would 
impose new time limits on federal habeas corpus appeals and require federal 
judges to defer to the factual findings made by state courts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. George M. Palmer told the panel there 
could be substantial additional delays when capital cases that have been in the 
state courts for years begin to flow into the federal courts. "When the bulk of 
the California cases hits the federal system, the road to final judgments will 
be long indeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, six habeas corpus petitions from condemned California inmates have 
been filed in federal courts. But the number is expected to increase 
considerably in coming months and a special committee of judges, lawyers and 
officials has been at work preparing new procedures to deal with the influx. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent rebuke to Deukmejian, San Francisco attorney Dennis P. Riordan, 
representing California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a group of defense 
lawyers, said that appeals to the federal courts would present little problem 
if state court judges would act to protect the rights of capital defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan noted that unlike federal judges, state judges do not enjoy lifetime 
tenure and warned that thus they are far more subject to election 
considerations and other political pressures that could influence their rulings 
in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the bitter 1986 California election that saw three high court 
members rejected by the voters, largely because of their reluctance to affirm 
death judgments, Riordan said: 
</P>
<P>
"A state judge who rules in favor of any capital defendant on any issue can be 
assured his ruling, no matter how clearly dictated by controlling 
constitutional precedent, will be publicly attacked by an opportunistic 
politician too dense to understand our system of constitutional rights or too 
cynical to care about its preservation." 
</P>
<P>
Riordan observed that in the seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court 
reinstated capital punishment in 1976, federal appeal courts, reviewing cases 
mainly from the South, found constitutional violations in 73% of the state 
court death rulings they reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as more cases from the Western states are taken to federal courts, there 
is no less reason for careful review of death verdicts, he said.

SENATE AIMS REBUKE AT JOHNSON IN CONDEMNING INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE

<P>
In an extraordinary rebuke aimed at apparent anti-Semitic remarks made by 
Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson, an agitated Senate on Friday 
unanimously approved a resolution urging legislators to avoid derogatory 
language in conducting their business. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution identified Johnson by name and directly quoted controversial 
remarks he made the previous day to Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who is 
Jewish and who accused Johnson of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution did not, however, criticize Johnson personally. Instead, it 
merely expressed the Senate's resolve to "assiduously avoid any conduct that 
could reasonably be expected to be offensive to any diverse element of our 
population." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
32-0 Approval 
</P>
<P>
In a hushed chamber after a 20-minute discussion, the Senate voted bipartisan 
32-0 approval of the unusual statement, which is not binding on anyone but is 
intended to discourage "derogatory appellations" in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
Only minutes before, Johnson, one of the most combative members of the 
Legislature, made a public apology to the Senate-Assembly budget conference 
committee of which Robbins is a member. Robbins, however, did not hear it 
because he was on the Senate floor awaiting action on the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Robbins, no stranger to controversies that he concedes he helped to 
create, demurred on whether he would accept the apology, insisting only that "I 
have no desire to prolong this." 
</P>
<P>
"If I said anything that was interpreted or could have been interpreted as 
having been a slur on anyone's religious preferences or ethnic background, I 
most sincerely apologize," Johnson told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
But the La Habra Republican told reporters he would never apologize for 
confronting Robbins in the committee on Thursday "on his inappropriate and 
quite possibly illegal behavior towards members of the Assembly Republican 
caucus." 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Robbins abused his position as one of the Legislature's six 
state budget writers to "bully and browbeat" Assembly Republicans as they came 
before the committee one by one to seek funds for locally popular projects in 
their districts, such as parks. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins targeted members of the Assembly GOP because they had refused to give 
their permission for reconsideration of a high-priority Robbins insurance bill 
that was killed earlier in the lower chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson learned of Robbins' conduct in the budget committee and charged angrily 
into the hearing room, where he greeted Robbins as "Senator Torquemada," a 
reference to Tomas de Torquemada, a leader of the bloody Spanish Inquisition 
against Jews in the late 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins took offense at the remark, to which Johnson shot back: "Maybe, 
senator, I should have referred to Sammy Glick." Glick was a central figure in 
the 1941 novel "What Makes Sammy Run" and was portrayed as an utterly ambitious 
and ruthless film mogul who was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
After the Senate action on the resolution, sponsored by his long-time ally in 
the San Fernando Valley, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), Robbins defended his 
conduct in dealing with Assembly Republicans and seemed to affirm the 
legislative adage: "Reward your friends and punish your enemies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fair Shake Factor 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he believed that the Assembly Republicans had dealt with his 
insurance measure "unfairly" and that as a state budget writer, "obviously I'm 
more receptive to someone who has given me a fair shake." 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, nerves fray and tempers flare as lawmakers fight to see that their 
interests are provided for in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
But this time around, pressures seem to loom larger, especially as the FBI and 
U.S. attorney press their investigations into suspected corruption in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Johnson charged that Robbins, a potential contender 
next year for the state insurance commissioner's post, was trying to divert 
attention away from a story in Thursday's Los Angeles Times reporting that the 
Van Nuys Democrat is a subject of the FBI probe. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Robbins had "chosen for political reasons to make a great issue 
out of something that I suspect in his heart he knows is utter nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Teri Burns, a spokeswoman for Robbins, later denied that notion. "He took it 
(Johnson's remarks) very personally. It wasn't related to other issues," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare for either house of the Legislature to take on one of its members 
publicly, although plenty of backbiting occurs in private. The last time one 
chamber directly criticized a member in public occurred in 1981 when the Senate 
reprimanded former Sen. John Schmitz (R-Corona Del Mar) for issuing a press 
release that described an audience at an abortion hearing as composed of "a sea 
of hard Jewish and (arguably) female faces" and using such terms as "queer, 
butch and bull dykes." 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the resolution on Friday, Davis noted that the measure fell far 
short of criticizing Johnson and zeroed in on his remarks that "could easily be 
construed as anti-Semitic." 
</P>
<P>
He said that derogatory racial or religious remarks have no place in 
legislative deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times like this that I think real men and real women have to stand 
up and take positions," Davis told the Senate, adding that no one asked him to 
introduce the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Views 
</P>
<P>
Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), one of the Senate's two black members, agreed, 
declaring that "we cannot tolerate in jest or in sincerity any insensitive 
remark." However, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who is Jewish and 
co-authored a successful political reform ballot initiative with Johnson, 
defended the embattled Republican and asserted that the resolution was 
unnecessary because Johnson had apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"Assemblyman Johnson says there isn't an anti-Semitic bone in his body, and I 
believe that," said Kopp, who ended up voting for the measure. "All of us are 
subject to the vicissitudes of simple momentary loss of rational discourse." 
</P>
<P>
Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno noted that "intemperate remarks" occur 
frequently in the Legislature and "all are regrettable." He said he did not 
believe it fair to single out in a formal resolution "one incident, as bad as 
it may have been."

odds. 
</P>
<P>
Thaddeus Kosciusko was at the side of George Washington during the American 
Revolutionary War and battled all his life for Poland's independence. 
</P>
<P>
Polish cavalrymen tried to resist German tanks and dive-bombers that invaded 
their land to begin World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity struggled for years for free elections in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Babraj (pronounced BOB-rye) is a former Polish national champion rower who in 
three short years as the coach of UCLA crew has hauled Bruin boats from 
insignificance to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
But Babraj and his varsity eight will be in deep water today, fighting against 
what would seem to be overwhelming strength. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will be rowing two-time defending champion Harvard and four other 
top heavyweight eights in the Cincinnati Regatta, the sport's national 
championships, on Lake Harsha on the Miami River. 
</P>
<P>
Although UCLA won its third straight Pacific Coast rowing championship in late 
May, nipping Washington by .17 of a second, the Bruins finished fourth earlier 
this month in the Intercollegiate Rowing Assn. (IRA) Regatta at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is entered in today's race, and the three other crews in the 
championship -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Northeastern -- finished 1-2-3 
ahead of the Bruins in the IRA final June 3. 
</P>
<P>
If past performance is an indication, Harvard should win its third straight 
national title today, and UCLA should finish fifth in the standard 
intercollegiate 2,000-meter race -- a whisker ahead of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Babraj, whose varsity finished fourth in the 1987 nationals and sixth last 
year, believes that Harvard will have its hands full of something besides oars 
today. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in his crew's previous two trips to the nationals, there were 
faster crews on the East Coast that didn't make it to the national final. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, these boats are the best in the country," he said. "We can be in 
the fight, and there are a lot of boats that can give Harvard a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, "This is a very outstanding Harvard boat, and it will be a 
very difficult task for anyone to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
One boat in today's race has beaten Harvard this year, and another came close. 
The Crimson lost only to Northeastern and just nipped Penn in dual competition. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Harvard tuned up for the nationals by easily defeating Yale in what 
is known back East as "the Boat Race." Harvard beat Yale by 38 seconds in the 
four-mile race, turning in a time of 19 minutes 15.3 seconds, the third-best 
clocking ever in the marathon event of crew. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard now leads the series with the Bulldogs, 73-51, in a rivalry that dates 
to their first race, in 1852 on Lake Winnipesaukee, in New Hampshire. In that 
first intercollegiate athletic competition of any kind in the United States, 
Harvard started off the long rivalry with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard has long been a rowing power, but under Coach Harry Parker, a former 
Penn oarsman and Pan American Games singles sculling champion, the Crimson has 
become nearly invulnerable. Parker's record at Harvard is 109-18 in 27 seasons, 
and his crews have won 16 Eastern Sprints championships -- symbolic of Eastern 
supremacy -- and four national titles in the 1980s, including the last two. 
</P>
<P>
He is also 23-4 against Yale, including 18 consecutive victories from 1963 to 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of Parker's shell this year has consisted of No. 6 oar Jack Rusher, 
No. 7 Philipp Schuller, a native of West Germany, and No. 8, the stroke, John 
Amory. The three have been pulling together on the varsity eight -- and at the 
same positions -- for three straight years, including the last two national 
championship crews. Rusher was the youngest oarsman on the U.S. eight that won 
a bronze medal at the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Babraj has four oarsmen who have each been on the varsity for at least three 
years, junior Stefanos Volianitis of Greece at No. 2 and seniors Teo Bielefeld 
at No. 6, Mike Stralka at No. 5 and Mike Farrell at stroke. 
</P>
<P>
But Babraj is without his best rower from the last two years, 6-foot-7, 
225-pound senior Craig Webster, who was ineligible this season. He said that 
the crew's rhythm used to revolve around Webster. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA coach said that in the absence of Webster, who rowed at No. 5, he has 
tended to rely on senior Marc Batchelder, who moved from No. 1, the bow, last 
season to No. 7, and on Stralka, No. 3 Simon Outhwaite, a senior in his first 
varsity year, and sophomore bow Brad Marquardt. 
</P>
<P>
Babraj said that he has not tried to replace Webster with four crewmen but that 
there is "a certain concept about rhythm. When one guy drops out it's like a 
new boat. It's simply a new boat and everyone's valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Other Bruin crewmen are senior Eric Kowal, a member of the junior varsity last 
year, at No. 4 and junior coxswain Ace Thayer. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder, Farrell, Stralka and Kowal were named first-team All-Pacific 10 
this season, and Babraj was selected as conference coach of the year for the 
the third straight season. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA alternates at Cincinnati are senior Brad Wieners and sophomore Greg 
LeSage, who were each on the Bruin four with coxswain shell that finished 
second to Navy at the IRA regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Parker knows UCLA and Babraj by more than just reputation. Last year, the 
Crimson handed UCLA its only loss of the regular season at the Redwood Shores 
regatta in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We raced them once last year, and they raced very hard," said the Harvard 
coach. "It was quite clear that they were a very good crew. There was no 
question whatsoever about that." 
</P>
<P>
Babraj thinks so too, but he also thinks that Harvard is the clear favorite. 
Nevertheless, he said, "We will try to do the impossible; it's fun."

U.S. SOCCER TEAM MUST QUALIFY ON REAL GRASS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. soccer team, which needs a victory here today against Guatemala after 
a sputtering start in its attempt to qualify for the 1990 World Cup, might have 
gained the confidence it lacked by winning the Marlboro Cup of New York, which 
actually was held in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the victories over Benfica of Portugal and Peru's National team two 
weeks ago might have had less to do with the U.S. team's skill than its 
home-field advantage. The field at the Meadowlands was covered with artificial 
turf, which is foreign to virtually every team outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
Peru's coach, Pepe Macias, complimented the United States after its 3-0 
victory, specifically mentioning its malicia. 
</P>
<P>
Malicia, which means cleverness or trickiness with the ball, is a word not 
often used in connection with the U.S. team, but perhaps it will become one 
with the continued improvement of midfielder Tab Ramos, 22, of Hillside, N.J., 
and the addition of swift midfielder Philip Gyau from the Baltimore Bays of the 
American Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
That aside, Macias said: "Our biggest problem was the field. I'd like to see 
how good they play on a regular field." 
</P>
<P>
The next opportunity for that will be against Guatemala at New Britain's 
Veterans Memorial Stadium in the fourth of eight World Cup qualifying matches. 
Of the five teams in the tournament, the two with the best records at the end 
of the year advance to the 1990 World Cup tournament in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
With a 1-1-1 record, the United States likely will have to win its two 
remaining home games to remain in contention. But unlike the Marlboro Cup, 
which does not count in the standings, World Cup qualifying matches must be 
played on natural turf. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, which split with the United States, leads the qualifying tournament 
with a 3-2-1 record after winning its most recent game, 1-0, at home last 
Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago. Those teams had earlier tied, 1-1. Trinidad 
and Tobago has a 0-1-2 mark, and Guatemala is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Vlasov, who stunned the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies 
earlier this month with his impassioned attack on the KGB, won a gold medal in 
the 1960 Summer Olympics at Rome as a super-heavyweight weightlifter, breaking 
Paul Anderson's world records for the jerk and total lift in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, in the Summer Olympics at Tokyo, Vlasov displayed the 
idealism that 25 years later would move him, as a deputy representing Moscow, 
to confront one of the world's most powerful secret police organizations. 
</P>
<P>
According to David Wallechinsky's "The Complete Book of the Olympics," Vlasov 
was the victim of a dishonest trick, having been lulled into a false sense of 
security when his Soviet teammate, Leonid Zhabotinsky, made believe he was 
conceding defeat. Thirty minutes later, Zhabotinsky broke Vlasov's world record 
on his final attempt and won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was choked with tears," Vlasov wrote later. "I flung the silver medal 
through the window. . . . I had always revered the purity, the impartiality of 
contests of strength. That night, I understood that there is a kind of strength 
that has nothing to do with justice." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Vlasov, 53, has been an outspoken critic of the Soviet sports 
bureaucracy. He wrote an article last year accusing sports officials of 
ignoring the use of anabolic steroids, amphetamines and other 
performance-enhancing substances. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Ben Johnson completed his testimony this week, the Canadian 
government's inquiry into drug use by athletes continues at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Track and Field Assn. has been severely criticized during the 
inquiry, but there was evidence that its new random, out-of-competition drug 
testing program works when it was revealed that Canadian high hurdler Julie 
Rocheleau, who finished sixth in the Seoul Olympics, tested positive last month 
for an anabolic steroid, stanozolol. That is the same steroid discovered in 
Johnson's system at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"How could Julie be so stupid?" asked Angella Taylor Issajenko, who has 
admitted her own steroid use in testimony at the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Kerr of San Gabriel, called a "steroid guru" by Issajenko, is 
expected to be on the witness stand Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He has admitted to treating hundreds of athletes with performance-enhancing 
drugs, including anabolic steroids. But he said he quit the practice in 1984, 
when he discovered that many athletes were supplementing his treatment with 
drugs bought on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Johnson has admitted taking steroids within a few months of setting 
the world record of 9.83 seconds in the 100 meters at the 1987 World 
Championships, International Amateur Athletic Federation officials plan to meet 
with attorneys at London next week to explore the propriety of removing his 
name from the record book. 
</P>
<P>
"Those hard-liners are seemingly gaining increased support," IAAF vice 
president Arne Ljungqvist told the Toronto Sun. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, which governs track and field, may call a special congress of its 
members next month to deal with the issue. If Johnson loses the record, it 
likely will be passed on to Carl Lewis. He ran 9.92 at Seoul in finishing 
second to Johnson, who won in 9.79 but was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, it has been proved that the United States no longer can throw 
together a team of college basketball players and automatically beat any other 
team in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in a World Championship qualifying tournament at Mexico City, the U.S. 
team, which had been selected only a few days before, lost in the opening game 
to the Dominican Republic, 116-108. 
</P>
<P>
The United States rebounded to win its next four games, struggling in a 
three-point victory over Cuba, and earned one of eight berths in the playoffs, 
which it opened Thursday night with a 75-73 victory over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Five teams advance to the World Championships in August of 1991 at Buenos 
Aires, Argentina. National Basketball Assn. players will be eligible for that 
tournament. 
</P>

Mary Decker Slaney withdrew from last Saturday's McDonald's Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee Invitational at UCLA's Drake Stadium after undergoing 
arthroscopic surgery the week before on her Achilles tendon. Her coach, Bill 
Dellinger, said she plans to compete again before the end of the summer. . . 
The Forum will be the site of the last game for Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons 
with the U.S. volleyball team. The USA Cup, involving the 1988 Summer Olympic 
gold, silver and bronze medalists -- the United States, Soviet Union and 
Brazil, respectively -- and South Korea, begins June 27 at Seattle, moves to 
San Francisco the next day, to UC Irvine's Bren Center June 30, and ends with 
the final July 1 at the Forum. Kiraly and Timmons have announced that they will 
retire from international competition after the USA Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Arie Selinger, who coached the U.S. women to a silver medal in volleyball at 
the 1984 Summer Olympics, has left the Dutch men's national team and moved to a 
Japanese club team. . . The Chinese Olympic Commitee, in a letter to the 
Olympic Council of Asia, said that Beijing will continue its preparations to 
stage the 1990 Asian Games despite the tumoil there. . . The U.S. Olympic 
Committee has established a Winter International Sports Festival, awarding the 
first one to Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1991. It will include biathlon, bobsled, 
figure skating, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, speed skating and Alpine skiing.

USC-ILLINOIS GAME SET FOR LABOR DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The USC-Illinois football game, originally scheduled to be played in the Soviet 
Union Sept. 2 as the Glasnost Bowl, has been rescheduled for Labor Day evening, 
Monday, Sept. 4, at 5 p.m., in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The game will give USC seven at home next season and will be shown nationally 
by ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
The Glasnost Bowl was canceled last week by Raycom, Inc., the game's organizer, 
because of contract difficulties with the Soviets. The contract, however, 
provided that in case of a cancellation, a home-and-home series between the 
teams would go into effect, the first game to be played in 1989 in Los Angeles.

FRESHMEN PLAY KEY ROLE IN JOURNEY TO SYRACUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Miller, UCLA's assistant crew coach, spends his days bellowing instructions 
to rowers at the team's boat house in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
But when Miller ordered 19 freshmen to voluntarily relinquish their seats on a 
flight home from a regatta in Redwood City, Calif., last April, many wondered 
about their coach's motives. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's resourcefulness, however, assured the financially strapped crew of 19 
ticket vouchers worth $200 each, compensation for giving up the seats on an 
overbooked flight from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstance allowed the varsity to send eight- and four-man crews and a 
pair to Syracuse, N.Y., to the prestigious Intercollegiate Rowing Assn. regatta 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' flight to Syracuse cost $238, so each rower needed only about $40 
to make the trip. UCLA finished second in the varsity fours and fourth in the 
varsity eights. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing anything we can to stay competitive," Bruin Coach Zenon Babraj 
said. "We couldn't have afforded that trip, but it was important for us to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Babraj said the crew needed the competition to prepare for the national regatta 
today in Cincinnati. He said funds had been budgeted for the nationals but not 
the Syracuse regatta. 
</P>
<P>
What did the freshmen say, when asked to wait for a later flight? 
</P>
<P>
"What could they say?" Babraj said. ELLIOTT ALMOND

'ROBIN HUD' PLEDGES TO REPAY $5.5 MILLION;

ADMITTED EMBEZZLER REJECTS ADVICE NOT TO TESTIFY AT HOUSE HEARING; THEFTS MAY

A Bible-quoting real estate agent told House investigators Friday that she 
stole about $5.5 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
to help the homeless but vowed to repay every cent of it someday even if she is 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Louise Harrell, dubbed by investigators as "Robin HUD," testified that 
her systematic theft of funds from foreclosure sales of HUD-owned properties 
went undetected for more than three years despite a rule requiring her and 
other closing agents to turn over funds from HUD property sales within 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately before her testimony, HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams estimated 
that Harrell and a dozen other agents under contract to HUD may have stolen $20 
million because controls on the foreclosure program were inadequate or 
non-existent. Adams said two indictments already have been returned and he 
expects other indictments "very soon."

Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations 
Committee's subcommittee on employment and housing, said, however, that the 
$20-million figure might turn out to be conservative. Thursday, Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh directed federal prosecutors nationwide to check every local HUD 
office for possible fraud and embezzlement in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"What I find truly shocking is that HUD did not have a system in place to 
discover that millions of dollars were missing," Lantos said. "Americans know 
that, if you are two days late with a mortgage payment, the bank is knocking on 
your door, asking: Where is the money?" 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, 46, volunteered to tell her story to the panel, which is investigating 
HUD program abuses, despite warnings from her attorney and members of the 
subcommittee that her testimony might be used against her in a criminal 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone should take the Fifth Amendment, it's you, ma'am," Rep. Christopher 
Shays (R-Conn.) advised her before she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Tony Gallagher, said he had explained to Harrell her 
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination but that Harrell insisted 
on testifying. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect no leniency or immunity from prosecution," she said. "I have come 
forward, as one who loves the Lord, in an attempt to confess to the world that 
I am a sinner and I am sorry that I diverted government funds. I am prepared to 
give everything that I have or ever will have to restore to the government that 
which was taken." 
</P>
<P>
She said she already has turned over her own properties, worth about $450,000, 
to HUD in the hope that that amount could be credited as partial restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony included several Bible quotations; one was 1 Peter 4:8: "And 
above all things have fervent love for one another, for love will cover a 
multitude of sins." 
</P>
<P>
On this theme, she added: "It was through love and compassion that I diverted 
the money and tried to help others. I did not keep any for myself . . . I 
justified my actions inwardly only by reminding myself that I followed a higher 
law in an attempt to ease suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Harrell said she created a charity called Friends of the Father that donated 
money for the homeless and also started four businesses, including a cleaning 
firm and a construction firm, that hired the poor and benefited charities. 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes filled with tears as she concluded her prepared statement, and Lantos 
halted the hearing momentarily so she could compose herself. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her emotional appeal, several members of the subcommittee were unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm uncomfortable with you invoking God," Shays said. "I don't believe God 
would ever motivate people to do what you did." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N. Y.) added: "For whatever noble purpose you stole 
this money, nothing forgives it." 
</P>
<P>
But the lawmakers were most concerned with HUD's oversight of contract agents 
like Harrell who assisted in foreclosure sales of 81,500 properties, usually 
single-family homes, during the fiscal year that ended last Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell suggested that HUD employees -- rather than private agents hired under 
contract -- should handle the foreclosure settlements to avoid theft. She said 
the Veterans Administration used this system for selling foreclosed properties. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Inspector General Adams said a sharp increase in the workload, along with a 
decline in the number of HUD employees nationwide, resulted in reduced 
monitoring of the private agents' work. 
</P>
<P>
Although "serious program weaknesses" were reported by his office in mid-1987 
to top HUD officials, Adams said, there was no effective crackdown on lax 
procedures until late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos asked why agents like Harrell were not required to post large 
professional bonds so that any thefts would be covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said Harrell did have a bond -- but only for $300,000 -- and he promised 
to recommend larger bonds, equal to two months of an agent's average 
transactions.

DISSIDENTS MAY STEER UAW CONFAB ON NEW COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A loose-knit group of dissidents within the United Auto Workers, angered by the 
union's increasing cooperation with auto industry management, is considering 
forming an organized opposition union caucus that would operate independently 
of the UAW's current hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The dissident group, called New Directions, may use the union's national 
convention beginning Sunday at the Anaheim Convention Center as the forum for 
announcing a more structured opposition inside the UAW -- an organization that 
would have its own staff and even collect dues from willing members. 
</P>
<P>
If New Directions goes ahead with the plan, it would represent the most serious 
challenge to the authority of the leadership of the million-member industrial 
union in decades. 
</P>
<P>
New Directions leaders and supporters say they won't decide until the six-day 
convention is under way whether to create such an organization. But even 
without a formal structure, New Directions has already shaken the union to its 
foundations, forcing a union-wide debate on what direction the UAW and the 
labor movement in general should take into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stage Set in Spring Elections 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim convention, in fact, is likely to become the focal point for that 
debate and is almost certain to go down as one of the most controversial UAW 
gatherings in years. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents, holding perhaps as many as 200 seats in the 2,000-delegate 
convention, seek to open up a floor debate on a wide range of procedural and 
philosophical issues that they believe need to be addressed to make the union 
more responsive to the rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
"New Directions will be trying to bring democracy back to our union," said 
Victor Reuther, the 77-year-old brother of the UAW's legendary Walter Reuther 
and now a supporter of the New Directions group. 
</P>
<P>
The stage for the Anaheim fight was set in regional union elections this 
spring, when two of New Directions' leaders, Don Douglas and Jerry Tucker, ran 
spirited, though unsuccessful, campaigns against the administration of UAW 
President Owen Bieber and his willingness to cooperate more fully with 
management on a wide range of shop-floor issues. Douglas and Tucker opposed 
Bieber's acceptance of Japanese-style "team concept" agreements and related 
labor-management programs now in dozens of U.S. auto plants. 
</P>
<P>
In their campaign for positions as regional directors who sit on the UAW's 
22-member governing executive board, Tucker and Douglas exploited the growing 
frustration among the rank-and-file over such joint programs to mount serious 
challenges against Bieber-endorsed candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more dissent in the UAW today because there is a lack of leadership 
in the union on these issues," said Douglas. "The people are trying to let the 
administration (of the UAW) know that we've got problems." 
</P>
<P>
UAW leaders and auto executives say that "team" programs are necessary if the 
U.S. auto industry is to remain competitive with Japanese car makers. But the 
dissidents respond that such programs undermine the contractual rights of union 
members and don't offer any real job security, pointing to instances in which 
workers have accepted such programs only to be laid off later on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Rhetoric' 
</P>
<P>
"Despite these joint programs, the problems we have had are not being 
addressed," complained Frank Hammer, president of UAW Local 909 in Warren, 
Mich., who supports Douglas. "To a lot of the members, this jointness is just a 
lot of rhetoric, something that is not backed up with any change in the way 
people are treated." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Douglas and Tucker narrowly lost their efforts to win enough 
delegates to be elected at the convention as regional directors -- but not 
before putting a scare into the UAW leadership. Douglas, a union local 
president from Pontiac, Mich., won a series of landslides in a number of big 
General Motors plants in his race for a Detroit-area regional directorship, and 
only lost after the incumbent, Robert Lent, made a comeback at Chrysler plants 
where he had spent much of his early union career. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who won a court-ordered election for the St. Louis-area directorship 
last year after a bitter fight with the UAW leadership, lost in his bid for 
reelection after Bieber mounted a fierce campaign to unseat him. The UAW's 
leadership demanded that every staff member of the international union 
contribute $500 to a campaign fund to defeat Tucker; Roy Wyse, the 
international's candidate, eventually won. 
</P>
<P>
But both Douglas and Tucker won enough delegates to the convention, where the 
actual election of regional directors and other union officers will be held 
next Wednesday, to form a vocal minority on the convention floor. They will be 
sure to use that voting power to raise their charges of election fraud against 
the UAW leadership. New Directions charges that the international union abused 
its power -- and got help from management, in some cases -- to defeat Douglas 
and Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two dissidents are likely to lose a credentials fight in which 
they hope to challenge delegates supporting Lent and Wyse, they are almost 
certain to take their charges to court after the convention.

TIME INC. STRIKES BACK; 
</P>
<P>
TIME'S STRATEGY SHOWCASES WASSERSTEIN PERELLA &amp; CO. AS SUPERSTAR IN MERGER 
BATTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Time Inc.'s decision to merge with Warner Communications, while rejecting a 
hostile offer from Paramount Communications, is bound to irk Time shareholders 
who wanted to accept Paramount's lucrative stock offer. 
</P>
<P>
But to Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., one of two investment banking firms that 
helped devise Time's complex takeover and defense strategy, such controversy 
has become part of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
In just the year and a half since it was formed, the small New York-based firm 
has become a mergers and acquisitions powerhouse, having a hand in many of the 
biggest and most controversial takeovers of the day. 
</P>
<P>
All told, its $36 billion in deals completed last year propelled it virtually 
overnight into the sixth-largest mergers and acquisition adviser, ahead of such 
giants as Salomon Bros. and Merrill Lynch. If some of its pending deals, such 
as Time-Warner, are completed this year, the firm could challenge Morgan 
Stanley for the top spot later this year, according to IDD Information 
Services, which ranks investment houses. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Wasserstein Perella has come to wield tremendous influence in 
the executive suites and board rooms of America's corporate elite, boasting 20% 
of the nation's 300 largest corporations as ongoing clients. It's amassed a 
$1-billion war chest that can be used to finance leveraged buyouts or buy 
equity positions in firms involved in deals. 
</P>
<P>
And its partnership with giant Nomura Securities of Japan, which owns 20% of 
Wasserstein Perella, gives it an entree into the fast-growing investment 
banking business in Asia, part of its goal to be a worldwide force in mergers 
and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Has Its Critics 
</P>
<P>
"They've done a damn good job and have carved out a good niche," says Perrin 
Long, industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm's rise has not come without its criticisms. As in the case of 
Time, some critics say Wasserstein Perella's staunch loyalty to defend its 
management clients against hostile takeovers has come at the expense of those 
firms' shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also have questioned the firm's judgment. A Delaware judge criticized 
the firm last November for a "conflict of interest" in backing a financial 
restructuring of Interco, a large furniture and shoe manufacturer, over a 
hostile takeover bid by the Rales brothers of Washington. Wasserstein Perella 
stood to receive higher fees if the restructuring succeeded, the judge argued. 
</P>
<P>
And although the firm professes to be as busy as ever, some Wall Street experts 
say it has grown too fast, increasing its vulnerability to layoffs or other 
troubles when merger activity subsides and the economy falls into recession. 
</P>
<P>
Such criticisms are not surprising, given the wide reach and high profile of 
the firm and its co-founders, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella. The two 
arguably were Wall Street's most respected merger and acquisitions advisers 
when they left the investment banking house of First Boston in February, 1988, 
after a disagreement with management over the firm's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserstein in particular was regarded as a creative genius, having devised 
many innovative takeover strategies while co-head of mergers and acquisitions 
at First Boston along with Perella. Their work was credited with propelling 
First Boston into the elite among investment bankers, and their departure to 
form a "boutique" investment house was seen as part of a new era where 
high-paid superstars no longer wanted to be constricted by the large 
bureaucracies and demands of full-service firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Major Deals 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving to form Wasserstein Perella, the duo have amassed an impressive 
list of deals. The firm advised Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in its record 
$25-billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, and Philip Morris in its 
$12-billion takeover of Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
Pending deals, besides Time-Warner, include advising LIN Broadcasting in its 
$6.5-billion acquisition by McCaw Cellular, and advising Beecham Group in its 
$7.8-billion bid for SmithKline Beckman. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we're stretched as thin as can be," said Mack Rossoff, a 
Wasserstein Perella managing director. 
</P>
<P>
To augment its deals, the firm also takes ownership positions in clients. For 
example, it owns 50% of Santa Monica-based Wickes Cos. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also performs ongoing advisory work for dozens of clients not involved 
in pending deals, helping them devise growth strategies or making them more 
resistant to possible hostile takeovers. Such clients include Alaska Airlines, 
Walt Disney Co. and Henley Group. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these clients, including Time, followed Wasserstein and Perella from 
First Boston. But the firm attracts and keeps them by hiring superstars. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to create an M&amp;A all-star team at the senior level and build 
around it," says Jon D. Kutler, head of Wasserstein Perella's Los Angeles 
office, one of six worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's now employs about 100 professionals, close in size to the mergers 
and acquisitions departments of major full-service firms, Kutler says. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also keeps clients by focusing on advisory work, avoiding 
underwriting, trading and other activities, he says. The firm also keeps 
clients by stressing takeover-defense work, generally avoiding working for 
corporate raiders. 
</P>
<P>
This defense orientation is key in the case of Time, which is also using 
Shearson Lehman Hutton as a co-adviser.

Court Denies MCI Request: A federal appeals court has ruled that MCI 
Communications forfeited its opportunity to have a multibillion-dollar federal 
telecommunications pact reopened because it failed to bid the first time. 
Involved in the dispute is one of two contracts to redesign and provide a pair 
of voice, data and video telecommunications networks in the 1990s, a project 
that may total $25 billion over 10 years. The General Services Administration 
awarded American Telephone &amp; Telegraph the contract for one network last 
December and US Sprint Communications the other. Losing out was Martin Marietta 
Corp., whose proposal included a substantial share for MCI.

Midway to Buy Some Eastern Gates: Strikebound Eastern Airlines has agreed to 
sell its eight Philadelphia airport gates and other assets to Chicago-based 
Midway Airlines instead of selling the gate spaces to Washington-based USAir. 
Eastern announced the move in a federal bankruptcy court hearing called to 
discuss an earlier proposed $85-million agreement under which it would have 
sold the Philadelphia gate spaces and two U.S.-Canadian routes to USAir Group 
Inc. That agreement had come under fire from government regulators.

2ND ROUND OF BIDDING FOR NWA ENDS WITH 4 OFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second round of bidding for the parent of Northwest Airlines ended Friday 
with four groups submitting revised offers. 
</P>
<P>
Few details were available about bids for NWA Inc. from Pan Am Corp., oil 
billionaire Marvin Davis, Northwest's machinists union and Los Angeles 
financier Alfred A. Checchi. As in the past, NWA refused to comment on the 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagan, Minn.-based airline, the fourth-largest in the nation, invited bids 
in April after rejecting an unsolicited $2.7-billion offer from Davis, the 
former owner of 20th Century Fox. The company has said it is reviewing options 
to "enhance shareholder value," including a possible special dividend to 
shareholders, a corporate reorganization or a sale. On June 5, a special 
committee of NWA's board of directors rejected all bids for the company, and 
invited bidders to submit new offers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Equity 
</P>
<P>
One initial bidder, MEI Diversified -- a snack foods company controlled by 
Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad and financier Irwin Jacobs -- dropped out of 
the bidding before Friday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Pan Am said its revised offer included $200 million in 
additional equity from Corporate Partners Ltd., a fund organized by the New 
York investment firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to take friendly positions in 
companies under attack. Earlier this year, for instance, it acquired a 10% 
stake in Polaroid, helping to rescue the company from a threat by Shamrock 
Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance with Pan Am suggests that Corporate Partners no longer confines 
itself to corporate rescues. Calls regarding Corporate Partners were referred 
Friday to Alan Colner, a Lazard vice president, who declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Offer 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am said that, with the contribution from Corporate Partners, it now has 
$600 million in equity available for an NWA acquisition. The New York-based 
airline declined to discuss other aspects of its offer, however. 
</P>
<P>
"The new equity allows us to make a bid that is vigorously competitive and 
attractive to NWA's shareholders, employees and others who have a strong stake 
in Northwest's long-term future," Thomas G. Plaskett, chairman and chief 
executive of Pan Am, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Davis said the Los Angeles investor's revised and final offer 
was greater than his previous bid for NWA but declined to provide details. 
Davis, who owns 3% of NWA, touched off the auction process with a $90-a-share 
bid. On Friday, NWA shares closed at $107.625, up 12.5 cents in composite 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Rates on Mortgages Drop: Thirty-year fixed-rate home mortgages are averaging 
10.04%, according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
That rate was down from a rate of 10.2% last week. On adjustable-rate 
mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate on a 30-year loan of 
8.95%, down from 9.09% the week before, Freddie Mac said.

LESSER-KNOWN ARTISTS GET A BIG BOOST, THANKS TO GRANT AND LA JOLLA ART MUSEUM

A series of 12 panels in vibrant colors portray traditional images of Mexico in 
"Oaxaca, Oaxaca," by San Diego artist Raul Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubcap Milagro 6," by National City's David Avalos, uses red lipstick and a 
bleeding heart of lead on a stainless steel hubcap to suggest a connection 
between cars and sex, heartache and the miracle of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Knife Table," a grouping of small, black, steel sculptures, some resembling 
animal trophies, by El Paso artist James Drake, protests the abuse of animals. 
</P>
<P>
The three pieces are among 14 works by emerging and "under-recognized" artists 
purchased over the last 1 1/2 years by the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. 
The acquisitions, currently on display and part of the museum's permanent 
collection, were made possible by a Los Angeles foundation through an 
innovative pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
"We've wanted to support our best local talent as well as to take the 
opportunity to explore the best in regional, national and international 
talent," said Madeleine Grynsztejn, associate curator at the museum. "We feel 
very fortunate to have been selected to participate in this pilot program. It 
was not a program you could apply for." 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla museum is one of three in the country that were chosen in 1987 by 
the Lannan Foundation in Los Angeles. The other institutions, which each 
received a $50,000 grant, are Atlanta's High Museum and the Hirshhorn Museum 
and Sculpture Garden in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of museums were reviewed," said Lisa Lyons, director of art programs 
for the Lannan Foundation. "In the final analysis, the three selected had 
demonstrated . . . the ability to uncover interesting emerging and 
under-recognized artists." 
</P>
<P>
Named for the late Chicago financier J. Patrick Lannan, who was a self-educated 
scholar, the foundation focuses its resources on visual and literary arts. With 
the exception of book publishing, all of the foundation's previous arts grants 
have supported exhibitions rather than acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Museums are having a great deal of difficulty raising acquisition money," 
Lyons said. "It is less difficult to raise money for a single, well-known 
artist than for a group of works by lesser-known artists." 
</P>
<P>
The grant guidelines prevented museums from spending more than $10,000 on any 
single artwork, to encourage the purchase of works by artists who are not 
well-known. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla museum has built an exhibit around the 14 pieces it purchased. By 
borrowing additional pieces from the artists or galleries, the museum has 
created an exhibit that fills six of its gallery spaces. The public gets a 
better sense of an artist's style and interests by viewing several works, 
Grynsztejn said. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions range from paintings and sculpture to multimedia assemblages, 
photography and video. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's acrylic painting of lawn chairs by Los Angeles artist William 
Leavitt is paired with a borrowed painting of file cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of humans, the lawn chairs and the setting of a typical suburban 
Los Angeles yard produce a sense of mystery and drama that is heightened by a 
Hollywood-like purple sky, Grynsztejn said. "You don't know who was there," she 
said. "It reminds me of a Raymond Chandler view of L.A. in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Tina Barney uses her own family as subjects, portraying a 
stereotypical "upper-crust East Coast family," Grynsztejn said. "Jill and Polly 
in the Bathroom," the large print purchased by the museum, shows two women in 
pink bathrobes in a pink-walled bathroom. Through the upstairs window, a 
doghouse is viewed in the yard below. 
</P>
<P>
"She shows the interpersonal familial tensions such as those between a mother 
and daughter," Grynsztejn said. Indeed, the two women seem to be avoiding each 
other in the confined space. In another Barney photograph, a kitchen is filled 
with family members, including adolescents, an adult and preteens. None 
maintains eye contact with any other. 
</P>
<P>
"These pictures are filled with still-life objects that tell a story," 
Grynsztejn said. "Her work reminds me of the 17th-Century Dutch paintings. (The 
people) are even cut off at the waist, as in Dutch paintings." 
</P>
<P>
Grynsztejn said the museum's commitment to the emerging artists has resulted in 
solo exhibits for at least three of them: Eric Snell, from Britain's Channel 
Islands, Drake from El Paso and Leavitt from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other artworks purchased are a video from Tony Oursler, a wall 
assemblage by Maurizio Pellegrin from Florence, Italy, a collaborative piece by 
San Diegans Louis Hock and Elizabeth Sisco and a steel sculpture by Carlsbad 
artist Kenneth Capps. 
</P>
<P>
Grynsztejn bemoaned the fact that "for every artist we have, there are that 
many more we would like to incorporate in the collection." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the acquisitions) are proof-positive that we continue to devote 
ourselves to the discovery and encouragement of emerging art and artists," she 
said. "We are committed to purchasing historical works. But we are just as 
committed to purchasing work that will become the treasures of the 21st 
Century. And we're confident that these pieces will become that."

MILES DAVIS ON THE CLUB SCENE: THE GIANT IS STILL GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miles Davis has been the most conspicuous figure in jazz since the death of 
Charlie Parker in 1955. Never one to rest on his laurels, Davis has moved from 
his be-bop roots to lead the music in a number of new directions. 
</P>
<P>
His historic quintet of the '60s is the present-day model for the contemporary 
stylings of musicians such as Wynton Marsalis. He introduced legions of rock 
'n' rollers to the world of jazz with the recording of "Bitches Brew" in 1969. 
And his collaborations with Gil Evans still rank as the most beautiful jazz 
orchestra sessions ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
The chance to see this giant in an intimate setting such as the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano on Thursday is a rare and welcome treat. 
</P>
<P>
But the more things change, the more they stay the same. Though Miles Davis now 
plays his trumpet against hip-hop backbeats and pop ballads, he still displays 
the inventiveness and lyrical sensibilities that have been part of his playing 
for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Davis demonstrated these skills before two sold-out shows, blowing strong on 
up-tempo numbers and stretching out on the blues. The trumpeter, who looks more 
like Michael Jackson every day, appeared fit and healthy and readily 
acknowledged the crowd's acclaim. His latest group layers bass, percussion and 
electronic keyboard effects to create a rich background for soloists and 
opportunities for complex interplay. 
</P>
<P>
The first show began with dual keyboard racks manned by Kei Akagi and Adam 
Holzman sounding the theme to Joe Zawinul's "In a Silent Way" before drummer 
Ricky Wellman began to pound out that 4/4 beat that the trumpeter seems to 
favor lately. Davis, dressed in baggy black pants and wearing a red embroidered 
jacket, stalked the stage, giving directions with nods and hand signals, 
punctuating rhythms with trumpet blasts, occasionally drawing out alto 
saxophonist Kenny Garrett or guitarist Foley to center stage for a solo. 
</P>
<P>
As he's done for the last several years, Davis, with the mute wedged firmly in 
the bell of his horn, played a nameless blues as his second number. His smears 
and spare style were matched by Foley, who pulled brief, expressive runs from 
his four-string guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' strongest playing came during the Scritti Politti number "Perfect Way." 
Laying the mute aside, he matched melodic mid-range statements with dramatic 
pauses and high-end squirts while bassist Benny Rietveld pushed the piece along 
with tight, snappy low-end. Garrett took advantage of the song's dramatics, 
closing it out with a series of shrieks that sent the audience into a wild 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Miller's "Hannibal" was the only number the group performed from Davis' 
new release "Amandla" (Warner Bros.). A rhythmic rocker that travels through a 
number of moods and dynamic changes, the tune allowed percussionist Munyungo 
Jackson, who's been heard locally with the Billy Mitchell band, to work out on 
congas, timbales and a variety of bells, gongs and other gizmos. 
</P>
<P>
Davis closed the show with "Time After Time," a tune he has been doing for 
almost as long as Cindy Lauper. The number is a perfect vehicle for Miles' 
melodic variations and provided the evening's most moving moments.

'A TOUCH OF THE POET' AT CELTIC ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's disconcerting to realize that Eugene O'Neill wrote his dreadful "A Touch 
of the Poet" after "Long Day's Journey Into Night." Like watching a former ace 
hurler refusing to retire and giving up countless home run balls, seeing "Poet" 
is to see O'Neill's genius in complete rigor mortis. 
</P>
<P>
Gaycq Manifold's Celtic Arts Center production transcends physical laws by 
making this truly dead play, about an arrogant, pipe-dreaming innkeeper and his 
headstrong daughter, a little more dead. Most of the actors appear either 
unsupervised (did no one inform Bernadette O'Neill as the daughter that her 
tone of anger becomes an unlistenable drone?) or terribly misdirected (J. P. 
Burns can't handle the innkeeper's transition to goodness any more than his 
dialect). This is three hours of dreariness, down to Richard Scully's set and 
Peter Strauss' lights. 
</P>
<P>
At 5651 Hollywood Blvd., on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., 
through June 25. Tickets: $10; (213) 462-6844. ROBERT KOEHLER

FACES . . .: PARIS NO SHY YOUNGSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mica Paris, 20-year-old British pop-soul singer rolls her eyes in 
exasperation, you know what she's thinking: "Here come those dreaded racial 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't even try to hide her irritation. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do I have to be a black singer?" asks Paris, whose first name is 
pronounced MEE-sha. "Why can't I be just a singer?" 
</P>
<P>
Touted as one of the better young singers in the business, Paris sounds quite a 
bit like Anita Baker, with a slightly jazz style and a mildly husky tone. 
</P>
<P>
Another mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Don't tell her she sounds like anybody. "They say I sound like Anita Baker or 
Aretha (Franklin) or this one or that one," she says. "I don't sound like any 
of them. I sound like me." 
</P>
<P>
Though well-known in Britain, Paris is just beginning to establish a reputation 
in the United States. Her debut album, "So Good" -- just out on Island Records 
-- features a single, "My One Temptation," that is climbing the black charts. 
Opening for Ashford and Simpson on their current tour has helped her visibility 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Raised by her grandparents in London, Paris has been singing nearly all her 
life. Because her grandfather was a pastor, she had a strict church upbringing 
and started as a youngster singing gospel music -- her strongest influence. In 
her teens she became a session singer. Once she started composing and making 
demo tapes, all the record companies -- she reports matter-of-factly -- were 
eager to sign her. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" she asks coolly. "I'm a very good singer. I have my own original 
style. I signed with Island because they didn't want to change me or turn me 
into a copy of some other singer." 
</P>
<P>
Her goal? It's not at all modest. 
</P>
<P>
"To be the best singer in the business," she replies, without hesitation. "I 
know I'm capable of it." DENNIS HUNT

'LIFE IN THE MINORS' LACKS DRAMA BASEBALL FANS CRAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Life in the Minors" affirms the ability of small stations -- in this case, 
Toledo's WGTE -- to provide big statistics: There are 3,800 players in 
baseball's minor leagues. Only 3% of those signing professional contracts reach 
the majors, where the average career lasts two years. 
</P>
<P>
This half hour, at 4:30 p.m. Sunday on Channel 28, also presents nice character 
studies of several members of the International League's Toledo Mudhens, a 
Detroit Tigers farm team managed by Pat Corrales. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reynolds is a 28-year-old slugger and four-time minor league all star 
who's never made it to the "bigs." He needs an off-season construction job to 
make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven-year-old pitcher Stan Clarke has had five shots in the majors, 
compiling a high earned run average that makes another shot unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds and Clarke talk about themselves and their love of baseball. Although 
young by most standards, both are elderly by minor league standards, and their 
futures seem bleak. 
</P>
<P>
What drives them? The answer is not forthcoming, for what's missing from this 
program, produced and directed by Brent Greene, is the story behind the talking 
heads, the texture of the minors, the sweat and the frustrations, the 
motivations for continuing to fight such long odds in a field where, over the 
long haul, the Mudhens are many, the Tigers few. HOWARD ROSENBERG

GALLERY ARTICLE COLLECTS KUDOS AND CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If street noise is any indication, it seems likely that mail regarding your 
article "You Can't Always Get What You Want" is something very close to 100% 
unfavorable. Although I have not been conducting a poll, several artists and 
gallery owners have volunteered to me that the article was unfair and overly 
negative. When they get into specifics, it becomes obvious that they have 
missed the point altogether and are reacting to things that weren't even 
implied. 
</P>
<P>
There are collectors, and there is a market in Orange County. If I didn't 
believe that, John Thomas would have moved to Santa Monica. Of course, we must 
find a way to tap the market. It was good to read that, in many cases (i.e. 
newsletters, etc.), we are doing the right things. 
</P>
<P>
There are problems. I agree completely that the lack of focus is one of them. 
If there were an equivalent to La Cienega in L.A. or Colorado in Santa Monica, 
there would be more incentive for Orange County residents to stay closer to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, to many there is some attraction in having to go somewhere 
else to find the "good stuff." The grass is always greener. There are even 
collectors and art consultants in Los Angeles (who) insist on going to New 
York! 
</P>
<P>
I could go on and on (such is my nature) but will restrain myself. The point is 
that I for one appreciated the article. There is a problem, and you have helped 
by calling attention to it.

'FIRST BORN' A GRIPPING GENETIC EXPERIMENT FROM A &amp; E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment network continues to provide interesting 
alternatives. The latest example is "First Born," a challenging and 
intriguingly off-center, three-part drama from the BBC airing on consecutive 
Saturdays and adapted from Maureen Duffy's futuristic novel, "Gor Saga." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's premiere (at 7, repeating at 11) almost immediately probes the 
sometimes clashing agendas and interests of science and humankind, laying the 
foundation for a tale about genetic experimentation that is captivating and 
intensely disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
British government scientist Edward Forester (Charles Dance) finally achieves 
his dream, the creation of a "new species -- one with man's intelligence, but 
without his homicidal aggression." A female gorilla secretly impregnated with 
human sperm has given birth to a male hybrid that Forester names Gordon. 
However, Forester's decision to spare the human-like infant -- whose only 
outward simian manifestation is thick body hair that soon disappears -- will 
return to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, Forester will be consumed by his terrible secret and his 
attempts to hide the truth from his own wife (Julie Peasgood) and from Gordon 
(Jamie Foster), who grows into a relatively normal teen-ager, unaware that his 
mother was a gorilla. The tension builds when romance blooms between Gordon and 
Forester's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Although marred by unexplained gaps and a terribly hokey sequence involving 
kidnaping, blackmail and fiery death, Ted Whitehead's script is an otherwise 
gripping, twisting, provocative and ironic exploration of moral and scientific 
issues. The performances are excellent, Philip Saville directs suspensefully 
and, all in all, "First Born" is absolutely first-rate. HOWARD ROSENBERG

GALLERY ARTICLE COLLECTS KUDOS AND CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a gallery owner in Orange County who is committed to showing works by 
emerging local artists, I would like to address some of the assumptions made in 
Cathy Curtis' article in the May 28 Calendar ("Collecting Art in Orange County: 
You Can't Always Get What You Want"). 
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white judgment that a gallery must either be a slave to the New 
York/Los Angeles model or it must be "commercial" and completely without 
artistic integrity or validity. What works in major urban centers is not 
necessarily the best system for other areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The unwillingness of the local media to give new galleries a chance to grow and 
experiment. One commercial show and the gallery is seemingly banished forever 
from serious critical consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The shining examples of TLK and Jack Glenn galleries, which, no matter how 
aesthetically successful they were, failed as businesses and are no longer any 
use to the artists they represented or the collectors who supported them. Using 
their owners and just a few other recurring sources for information on what is 
happening in the Orange County art scene limits the view that the general 
public perceives, and tends to perpetuate the gloomy atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The assumption that unless a contemporary artist is working in a style that is 
currently trendy or on the "cutting edge," the work has no meaning. By this 
standard, no musician need ever interpret a Mozart concerto again -- after all, 
it's been done before. 
</P>
<P>
The artists that I represent are serious, full-time painters who depend on 
sales made through this gallery for their livelihoods. If I must occasionally 
show more commercial work to subsidize the exhibitions of more challenging 
artwork, then I will. Exposing the gallery to more people has always directly 
led to sales and new appreciation of works by the lesser-known artists that I 
represent. This is what seems to work in Orange County.

ROBERT HILBURN: MCCARTNEY BLOSSOMS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONDON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"OK, that's it for today," a slightly weary Paul McCartney said, calling an end 
to a three-hour rehearsal with the six-piece band that will accompany him this 
fall on his first U.S. tour in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney -- a few wrinkles now etched in what remains one of the most famous 
faces ever in rock -- laid down his left-handed bass guitar and began chatting 
idly with his wife, Linda, who plays keyboards in the band. Their son, James, 
11, joined them. 
</P>
<P>
But two other band members started toying around with a few notes, working up 
enough of an exchange for the rest of the band -- including Paul -- to 
eventually join in a jam. After a few minutes, he started singing a slow, 
bluesy version of "Blue Suede Shoes," one of rock's early anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wel . . . ll, it's . . . one . . . for . . . the . . . money . . . two . . . 
for . . . the . . . show, three . . . to . . . get . . . ready . . ., now . . 
go . . . cat . . . go. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney and the band then went through a snippet of Little Richard's old 
"Lucille" -- a song that McCartney included on the oldies album that he 
released late last year in the Soviet Union -- and his own "Jet," a hit with 
his '70s band, Wings. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney smiled broadly as he sat the bass down the second time, finally 
ending the rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
After numerous career ups and downs since he walked away from the Beatles two 
decades ago, McCartney, who'll be 47 on Sunday, seems to be on a roll again. 
The Soviet oldies album was an especially engaging salute to '50s rock, and the 
early reviews of his new studio album, "Flowers in the Dirt," have been the 
most enthusiastic since his "Band on the Run" album in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"McCartney comes alive on ('Flowers')," declares Rolling Stone magazine in its 
current issue. "If he hits the road, as rumored this fall, he will have a 
half-dozen or so new tunes that can ably hold their own against his standing 
repertoire. In the case of one of the finest songwriters in the history of 
rock, that's no mean accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a tour had been circulating for months, but there was no confirmation 
until now -- a fact that led to speculation among industry insiders that 
McCartney, whose last three albums all failed to make the U.S. Top 10, was 
waiting to see how the new collection was received before committing to the 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
But McCartney, in an interview after the rehearsal, said the decision to tour 
was made long before the reviews started appearing. He knew he was ready to go 
on the road again as soon as he felt comfortable with his new band and with the 
new material. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot into this album," McCartney said, sitting in a lounge at the 
rehearsal studio, sipping some hot tea. "I was fed up with not making a good 
album last time (1986's 'Press to Play'), so I sat down and tried to figure out 
what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see that I was into a lot of surrealistic phrases on that album (as 
opposed to) songs. This time, I wanted good songs. It was time to prove 
something to myself: Either I can't write any more or I'd better write 
something." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney had planned to return to the United States sooner, but touring was 
put on a back shelf after the Japanese drug bust. McCartney spent spent nine 
days in jail there in 1980 after customs inspectors said they found eight 
ounces on marijuana in his suitcase. "That kind of threw things apart," he 
said, "and I thought I'd just make records for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The albums, however, were often so uneven that they baffled even the 
ex-Beatles' strongest supporters -- a few jewels tucked in among material so 
indifferent that you wonder why a man of his reputation and wealth would even 
put his name on them. Addressing that point in an interview just before the 
release of his 1986 album, McCartney downplayed his emotional attachment to the 
work. "I'm not that precious with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McCartney, who increasingly is becoming more open in interviews a la his 
late songwriting partner John Lennon, is clearly a man with considerable pride, 
and the repeated rejection stung. 
</P>
<P>
He spent three years putting "Flowers in the Dirt" together and took a bold 
step in collaborating on songs with Elvis Costello. The latter is not only 
perhaps the most acclaimed rock lyricist of the '80s, but a man who can exhibit 
the cynicism and bite associated with Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
After a test period (which included some work on "Veronica," Costello's current 
Top 20 single), the pair got together to write nine songs, four of which are on 
"Flowers in the Dirt." The best of the tracks convey an unusually daring, 
almost experimental edge. 
</P>
<P>
About the Costello collaboration, McCartney said: "I heard somewhere that Elvis 
said it was like two writers in collision, but that wasn't my feeling about it. 
To me, it was this feeling of two craftsmen working on the same table. He'd 
polish the top and I'd fit the legs. I wouldn't want to make too big a point of 
it, but it was at times more like the way John and I used to work than any 
other collaboration I've had." 
</P>
<P>
But the album's strengths aren't tied solely to the Costello collaborations. 
McCartney's best other tracks -- including "Put It There," an affectionate 
father-to-son message, and "This One," an expression of romantic devotion -- 
have been called as intimate and warm as anything the former Beatle has ever 
done. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney indirectly credits television producer Lorne Michaels, best known for 
his role in developing "Saturday Night Live," with getting him to write about 
more personal topics. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with Lorne and Paul Simon before Paul recorded the 'Graceland' album and 
Lorne was telling him that he should write about stuff that is really going on 
in his life . . . and I took that to heart and I tried to think about what 
matters to me, especially at this time in my life . . . middle age, four 
children (ages 26 to 11). That's where a song like 'Put It There" came from. 
It's an expression of love and companionship, kind of like 'He Ain't Heavy, 
He's My Brother'. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sample line from the song: 
</P>
<P>
 Put it there if it weighs a ton . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That's what a father said to his young son 
</P>
<P>
 As long as you and I are here, put it there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some people are going to think that is a very sentimental idea, but it 
is a very real line to me," McCartney continued. "It's what my father used to 
say to me and he's gone now. It's like, make the most of this moment, which I 
suppose has become my philosophy. Life is so fragile. We saw what happened to 
John, and there ain't no getting him back . . . unless we meet in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Who and Rolling Stones, who'll also be touring this year, McCartney 
will play indoor arenas rather than stadiums. He feels more comfortable in the 
more intimate setting and he feels his music is more suited to it. Just as he 
did in 1976 with Wings, he will include a few Beatles numbers in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Where McCartney discouraged questions about the Beatles early in his solo 
career, he seems increasingly comfortable talking about his former band, even 
though he is still embroiled in a lawsuit with George Harrison, Ringo Starr and 
Lennon widow Yoko Ono involving recording royalties. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney even skipped the Beatles' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction 
ceremony last year in New York because he thought it would be hypocritical 
embracing the other ex-Beatles at a time when they are involved in the 
apparently bitter suit. 
</P>
<P>
But McCartney seems able to separate the suit from the personalities. He 
doesn't rule out working with Harrison or Starr on future projects, and seems 
to enjoy reminiscing about the glory years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the tour, McCartney is looking forward to a project he is doing in 
association with the Liverpool Philharmonic. "They've asked me to write an 
(extended) piece for the orchestra and cathedral choir," he said. "I've got two 
years to write it and it is very rewarding so far. The story is based on 
someone growing up in Liverpool . . . my story, I guess, except minus the 
Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney paused. "You know, it's strange to think what life would have been 
like without the Beatles years," he said, standing as he prepared to head home. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were great years. . . . People never understand the thrill wasn't just 
being in the Beatles, but helping created what made the Beatles . . . the magic 
of creating something, making a rabbit come out of a hat," he said, leaning 
back on a lounge sofa. "John and I didn't find the magic for about 20 songs, 
but once we got the knack of writing, it really flowed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also the excitement of the times . . . the way all the bands excited 
each other. The Stones came out with 'Satisfaction' and that made a lot of 
people go, 'Wow, fuzz guitars.' When Dylan came out, that tumbled it all into 
poetry. Hendrix, the Who. There was always something going on to inspire you." 
</P>
<P>

ADAMS CASE CENTERS ON 'LOST' NEGATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ansel Adams incorrectly told U.S. Department of the Interior officials that 
negatives for pictures featured in a new book of his work had been destroyed in 
a fire when, in fact, they were housed in his vault, new court documents 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the vice president of a publishing company defending itself in 
litigation over the book contended in an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court 
earlier this week that a wide variety of what may be some of Adams' most famous 
pictures "would be the property of the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to contentions originally made in an interview with The Times, John 
Diamond asserted in the court filing that "many more of Adams' photographs than 
was originally suspected are in the public domain." Diamond referred to 
photographs Adams took while working as a government employee but which Adams 
had stipulated to be part of his private work. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation that Adams gave government officials incorrect information on 
the fate of the negatives for the Mural Project, a series of 225 images of 
national park scenes that Adams shot in 1941 and 1942, is contained in 
documents filed by Day Dream Publishing, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The company is the chief defendant in the federal court suit filed in Los 
Angeles earlier this year by the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. The trust 
is seeking an injunction to prevent Day Dream from capitalizing on Adams' name 
in promotion of its book, "The Mural Project," a photographic anthology of 85 
of the national park images. Day Dream also seeks to publish wall calendars and 
date books using the disputed photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Day Dream and the book's two authors assembled the volume using copies of 
prints made by Adams from the original negatives. The 226 prints are part of 
the public-domain collection of the National Archives and copies are available 
to anyone willing to pay fees averaging about $10 per photograph. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Mural Project negatives has emerged as a central issue in the 
federal court litigation. Officials at Yosemite National Park said they 
attempted twice, without success, to learn from Adams the fate of the negatives 
in the year or so before the photographer died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents filed by the Adams publishing trust earlier this year, the 
photographer's estate revealed that the negatives are in the trust's custody, 
housed in Adams' personal vault on the grounds of his home in Carmel Highlands, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
But Day Dream charged in the new court documents that Adams told Interior 
Department officials that the negatives had been lost in a fire. And on Friday, 
Jill Brett, a National Park Service spokeswoman in Washington, confirmed that 
Adams discussed the destruction of the negatives in a visit to Washington with 
his wife, Virginia, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Brett said Adams had come to Washington to inspect the surviving Mural Project 
prints. The photographs were commissioned for anticipated mural-size display in 
Interior Department buildings. The huge enlargements were never executed, 
however, and only a set of conventional-sized prints, made by Adams himself, 
have remained. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1979 Interior Department employee newsletter that published an 
account of Adams' visit, the photographer told officials the negatives were 
destroyed in a fire in 1937 -- four to five years before the photographs were 
actually made. 
</P>
<P>
In his affidavit, Diamond charged Adams and his trust engaged in "a deception 
that is ongoing and prolonged." However, David Vena, a Los Angeles lawyer who 
is one of the Adams trustees, responded Friday that Adams was notorious for his 
inability to remember dates -- a foible to which Adams alludes in his 
autobiography to explain his ascribing at least four different dates to his 
most famous image, "Moonrise, Hernandez, N.M.," shot in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said the trust is not certain whether all or only some of the mural 
project negatives are in the Adams vault. He said a detailed comparison of the 
prints in the National Archives with negatives in the vault would have to be 
made since Adams made several similar shots of each image. 
</P>
<P>
The similarity of images in question is pertinent to the dispute over whether 
other Adams photographs should be considered in the public domain. In his 
correspondence and employment arrangements with the Interior Department, he 
stipulated he would mix his government photographing with his private work. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, one of his most famous pictures, "White House Ruin, Canyon de Chelly 
National Monument, Ariz.," made in 1942, is almost identical to an image in the 
government collection and published in the new book. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said there is no doubt that some prints made by Adams in his lifetime that 
are now highly valued on the art photography market were, in fact, made from 
Mural Project negatives. He said the question is not relevant to the dispute 
over publication rights and rights to use Adams' name and reputation in 
connection with promotion of the unauthorized book.

KEDG OWNS 'K-LITE,' JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge put a stop Friday to the battle of the Lites, ruling that 
KEDG-FM has exclusive ownership of the trademark "K-LITE" and enjoining rival 
easy-listening station KGIL-FM from using the moniker. 
</P>
<P>
Both stations have been calling themselves "K-LITE" on the air. KGIL (94.3), 
owned by Buckley Communications, has used the term in broadcasts since March 23 
and KEDG (101.9) began using the term May 13, the day after the Golden West 
Broadcasters station switched formats from a varied mix of rock to the current 
assortment of soft hits. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing testimony Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Irving Hill ruled 
Friday that although KGIL had been using the name longer, it had "aggressively 
seized upon" the name unlawfully. The "K-LITE" slogan was owned by Westwood 
One, which sold it to Golden West Broadcasters on May 5, along with its record 
library, for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious with two radio stations in the same market using the same format 
and (trade) mark, there is serious confusion in the public's mind," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The "K-LITE" slogan had been used for the previous three years to describe 
easy-listening station KIQQ-FM (100.3). Westwood One acquired it in purchasing 
the station last March, but stopped using the name when it turned the station 
into KQLZ, the hard-rocking "Pirate Radio." Station deejay and program director 
Scott Shannon announced March 17: "Ladies and gentlemen, at this time K-LITE 
signs off the air forever." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for KGIL cited that statement as a basis for their claim that they 
had appropriated the term because it had been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Hill disagreed with this contention. "The evidence is clear that Westwood One, 
the previous owner of the mark and the seller of it, never intended to abandon 
the mark," Hill said, adding that it was Westwood One's intention to sell the 
mark because of its "substantial value."

BONSAI: ANCIENT ORIENTAL ART DRAWS MODERN U.S. DEVOTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonsai -- dwarf trees and bushes trained to grow in pots -- is, like all 
gardening, an art form. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that planting flower beds, planning shrubbery and/or plotting 
lawns is akin to painting on a huge canvas, while bonsai is closer to sculpting 
in clay: The artist takes a shapeless plant and molds a graceful statue out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Potted plants originated in India; with the birth of Buddhism in the 6th 
Century BC, they were incorporated into religious rituals. The lovely 
terra-cotta pots used by holy men garnered the interest of Chinese gentry, who 
began gathering small specimens of gnarled, windblown trees from the mountains 
and bringing them into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
As Buddhism spread into Japan about AD 550, it brought bonsai with it; the 
earliest scrolls showing the miniature potted trees date to the 12th Century. 
The Japanese perfected the already-ancient art. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonsai in America 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until World War II that Americans became familiar with bonsai, as GIs 
brought plants back with them from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, trees that have been in the same pots for 500 years are fairly 
common," says Ted Matson, president of the Descanso Bonsai Society. "In 
America, a bonsai from the '50s is an old masterpiece." 
</P>
<P>
Matson says bonsai teaches a reverence for nature and a respect for the way 
things grow. "You learn patience," he says. "You can't hurry a tree. If you 
want to cut something back to shape it, you have to wait for it to grow again. 
</P>
<P>
"Trees are wonderful -- they're alive and can outlive you by several 
generations," Matson says. "If you assume the responsibility for such a tree's 
care, you must respect that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Collection 
</P>
<P>
A lot of bonsai growers' collections get started, ironically, because the art 
does require such patience, said Matson. "It's so interesting and satisfying to 
work on the trees that you keep acquiring more to keep you busy while you're 
waiting for the early ones to grow." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend and all next week, you can either get a start on your own bonsai 
collection or add a specimen to one you've already got going. The 19th annual 
exhibit by the Descanso Bonsai Society runs from today until June 25 from 9 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day at the Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 300 bonsai plants will be on display, in every style from "upright" to 
"group" to "wind-swept." You'll see plants ranging in height from 2 inches to 4 
feet; some plants flower, some have miniature fruit on them. The plants are 
judged in novice and advanced categories. 
</P>
<P>
A sale runs during the entire exhibit. You can purchase exquisitely sculpted 
trees or the raw stock to try your hand at creating your own. 
</P>
<P>
Books have been written on the creation of bonsai; you can find a list of 
classes at the Descanso show that will help you take a bushy, uninteresting 
juniper and turn it into a tiny replica of a Monterey pine. 
</P>
<P>
But what do you do if you just want to buy a pretty little plant and give 
bonsai a try? 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost: Don't take your tree home and put it on top of the TV set 
or on the coffee table. "That will kill it. You really want your plants 
outside," Matson says. A bonsai thrives in a spot where it gets morning sun and 
no reflected heat from white stucco walls or glass doors. "The foliage actually 
can take a lot more heat than the root ball," Matson says. "If the plant sits 
in a hot, dry place, the soil just bakes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benign Neglect 
</P>
<P>
The trees need regular watering -- overhead sprinklers are fine unless the 
plant is in bloom -- but overwatering is a leading cause of death. You want to 
keep the soil moist, which may mean daily watering if you're in a hot, interior 
valley, but a little benign neglect isn't all bad, either, according to Matson. 
</P>
<P>
Both fertilizer and pesticide are important for bonsai, Matson says. "You can 
use any good commercial brand of either, but just cut the recommended dose in 
half for bonsai." 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to remember about your bonsai tree is this: It is a 
living sculpture. If you don't keep it molded, it will lose its lovely shape 
and become nothing more than a shrub in a pot. "You can't be afraid of the 
tree," Matson says. "Pinch it, prune it, keep it growing in the form you got 
it. Otherwise, in two months, you'll be disappointed with it." 
</P>
<P>
Descanso Gardens, 1418 Descanso Drive, La Canada. Admission is $3 for adults, 
$1.50 for students and seniors 62 and older, 75 cents for children 5-12, and 
free for those under 5. Admission to the bonsai show is free once you're inside 
the gardens.

POETS TO RAISE MONEY AT COMEDY STORE FOR CHILDREN'S AIDS FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For reasons known but to the Muse, the Los Angeles poetry scene, long dormant, 
has begun to burgeon again, most notably under the inspirational aegis of a 
group called Poetry in Motion. 
</P>
<P>
PIM has attracted not only a host of prominent California poets but the sizable 
support of celebrity votaries as well, many of whom join in the readings, some 
from their own body of work. 
</P>
<P>
Having outgrown its regular Tuesday night sessions at the ultrachic Helena's, 
PIM recently moved to Heartbreak Cafe, only to overflow again and decamp to 
Cafe Largo. On June 25, however, a benefit performance will be held at the 
Comedy Store, 8433 Sunset Blvd., starting at 9 p.m. and contributing to the 
Children's AIDS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively scheduled are such local poets as Wanda Coleman, Austin Strass, 
Jack Grapes, Hubert Selby Jr. and Lewis MacAdams. Among celebrities will be the 
accomplished (and published) Macdonald Carey as well as Ally Sheedy, Justine 
Bateman, Ed Begley Jr., Drew Barrymore, Dennis Christopher and Michael O'Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
The price of tickets (a tax-deductible $20) will help relieve the suffering, 
meet daily and emergency needs and strengthen the wills and hopes of children 
infected with the AIDS virus through special projects tailored to the youths' 
proclivities. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets available at Ticketron locations; for nearest outlet, call (213) 
642-4242.

A column by Alan Dershowitz (Op-Ed Page, June 11) stated that the National 
Lawyers Guild refused to condemn violence by the Chinese Army against the 
students, pending more information. Michael Cowan, executive director of the 
National Lawyers Guild, says thaton two occasions he personally stated to 
Dershowitz's associate that the guild condemned the use of state violence 
against nonviolent demonstrators in China and urged the Chinese government to 
abide by its constitution regarding the rights to free speech.

COUNTY SCHOOLS WIN AS RURAL, SUBURBAN AREAS STAGE AMBUSH

Turning the tables on urban Democrats, a loosely knit coalition of legislators 
from the suburban and rural areas of the state exerted new-found muscle in the 
Assembly this week and won support for a school funding package that left 
cities such as Los Angeles out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise will mean $69 million in additional funds for Orange County 
school districts. It will go a long way toward satisfying educators who 
complained their schools were not receiving their fair share of state revenue. 
The compromise, dubbed historic by many in Sacramento, is in part the result of 
an onslaught of letters from parents in Orange County school districts, which 
have been leading the charge for more equal funding, Orange County legislators 
and educators say. 
</P>
<P>
John Perry, assistant superintendent of Orange Unified School District and 
president of the statewide Assn. of Low-Wealth Schools, said three school 
districts -- Orange Unified, the Capistrano Unified School District and another 
one in Northern California -- generated 50,000 letters, mostly from parents, 
demanding that legislators equalize school funding. 
</P>
<P>
Equalizing school funding has long been a rallying cry in Orange County, 
because 22 of the county's 28 school districts are below the state average in 
per-student base revenue funds from the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I really attribute the sensitivity (of legislators) on the equalization 
question to the effort on the part of the parents," Perry said. "Legislators 
tend to respond a lot more to parents than to (school district) staffers." 
</P>
<P>
The budget deal, announced Tuesday, ended an eight-day stalemate and led to 
Assembly passage of a nearly $50-billion version of the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
While legislators from both sides of the aisle warn about making too much of 
the vote, some lawmakers are calling the deal "historic" because -- if Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the Senate agree -- it will free up hundreds of millions 
for money-starved suburban and rural schools by directing money away from urban 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the new money, roughly $1.4 billion over two budget years, being 
generated for schools by the landmark school funding initiative Proposition 98, 
which was approved by voters last Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly plan to implement Proposition 98, to be amended into a long-term 
school funding bill, was unusual in that it bypassed the Education and Budget 
committees controlled by big-city Democrats. That was possible because Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) set up a special team of negotiators to 
draft the proposal, including Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress). 
</P>
<P>
Once agreed upon by the special team, the plan was informally ratified in a 
budget vote marked by a rare bipartisan alliance. Casting "no" votes were such 
members of the urban Los Angeles delegation as Terry B. Friedman, Teresa P. 
Hughes, Richard Katz, Burt Margolin, Lucille Roybal-Allard and Maxine Waters, 
all of whom could normally be counted on to vote for a budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, expressing concerns shared by other members of the Los Angeles 
delegation, said he refused to vote for the budget because he believed that the 
school aid package was "vindictive" and "a purposeful effort to get L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Hughes, the chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, which 
was bypassed by the negotiators who put together the plan, said: "I'm not very 
pleased. Los Angeles is really getting worked over." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing Out of Kilter 
</P>
<P>
But while the Los Angeles Democrats were crying foul, normally powerless 
legislators from Orange County, suburban cities such as Glendale and rural and 
farming communities in California's Central Valley were praising the vote 
because it recognized for the first time in recent years that school finance 
was out of kilter, with big-city schools drawing most of the dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Allen called it a "foundation for fairness" for future education funding. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County educators agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long overdue," Capistrano Unified School District Supt. Jerome 
Thornsley said. "Their teachers are important, but so are ours. . . . People 
want report cards that measure up (to those of other districts) and they want 
accountability, but we're not treated equally in funding." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Capistrano Unified parents and educators were so angry about the 
unequal funding that they decided to spend $4,000 a month to hire their own 
lobbyist in Sacramento to follow the school funding bills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Unified organized a contingent of 450 parents who paid legislators a 
visit last month to press them on the funding issue. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say they will keep up the pressure to make sure the compromise 
doesn't unravel. Thornsley said that in his district, the teachers union and 
school board trustees have written to their counterparts in the other 21 Orange 
County school districts asking them to keep pressure on their legislators. He, 
likewise, has written to other superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who played a leading role in putting the 
deal together, said Republicans for years have complained that fast-growing 
suburban and rural communities were being shortchanged in the annual division 
by political leaders of the roughly $15 billion a year the state gives to 
school districts. Because they had no hard numbers to back up their contention, 
two years ago Republicans ordered a study of education expenditures. This year, 
they got their first report. 
</P>
<P>
What the study showed was that when all the various special state financial aid 
programs were added up, the Los Angeles Unified School District was receiving 
$1,045 per pupil, San Jose Unified was getting $1,346 for each student, and San 
Francisco, Oakland and San Diego were getting $934, $810 and $702 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cries of Outrage 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers led to cries of outrage when lawmakers compared them to much 
lower figures for school districts outside the big cities. For example, in 
Orange County, Capistrano Unified gets $280, Orange Unified gets $206, and 
Santa Ana Unified receives $243. 
</P>
<P>
"When we totaled the figures up, it confirmed what we had felt all along was 
happening. In fact, the disparities were far worse than we had thought," Nolan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the question of fairness, Republicans also had the law on their 
side. In 1971, the California Supreme Court in a landmark decision ruled that 
the state's system of financing public education was illegal because there was 
a huge disparity in funding between rich and poor school districts. The 
Legislature enacted a series of laws designed to bring about equality in 
funding, but the figures turned up by Assembly Republicans showed that a huge 
gap still existed. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to the issue give many reasons for the disparities in funding. 
</P>
<P>
State funding for schools is done in a variety of ways, from unrestricted 
financial aid based solely on the number of students in each district to grants 
made in support of more than 50 different special programs, each one designed 
to meet different needs. 
</P>
<P>
Separate financial aid programs were created to provide extra assistance to 
gifted students, slow learners and poor readers. Others, with a broader sweep, 
were put together to provide extra financial aid to school districts with major 
problems, such as those under court order to desegregate or those that have 
large concentrations of poor and foreign-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pulled In Money 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School district, by far the largest school district in 
the state, got in on the ground floor of all of the programs and was a magnet, 
pulling in money for just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for other districts was that as a result of a series of lean state 
budgets in the 1980s, little new money was added to finance the special 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a great manipulation by certain legislators on the categorical aid," 
Capistrano Unified's Thornsley said. "Los Angeles Unified is not a wealthy 
district just on the basis of base revenue, but they've gotten a lot of money 
through categorical funding." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher Wage Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Helping to galvanize the legislators was the lucrative wage settlement the Los 
Angeles Unified School District recently gave its teachers. The generous 
settlement, which will boost teacher wages by 24% by 1990, rankled numerous 
legislators, who complained that other districts could not afford to pay their 
teachers as well, even though housing prices and living expenses in Glendale, 
Alhambra and other communities are comparable to those in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The financing plan promoted by Republicans would take away some of the money 
that would have helped Los Angeles meet its new payroll, but legislators insist 
that the district will still get enough to finance the strike settlement 
package. 
</P>
<P>
(Even though Los Angeles Unified, with nearly 600,000 students, will get less 
than most other districts on an average per-pupil basis, it would still get a 
lump sum payment of $50.7 million under the equalization plan. By contrast, 
Orange County's 28 school districts, with 348,000 students, would split a total 
of $69.4 million. On top of that, school districts statewide would divide 
another $521 million in unrestricted funds that they could spend for such 
things as payroll during the current and upcoming budget years.) 
</P>
<P>
What followed was an eight-day stalemate during which Republicans circulated 
computer printouts comparing education funding district by district. The 
disparities in funding cut across party lines. "The printouts sent shock waves 
through the Democratic Caucus," Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Normal Democratic team players such as Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton) were incensed. When negotiators came up with a plan to help rural 
and suburban districts, Johnston said he did not have any sympathy for Los 
Angeles because "they've pigged out so much over the years." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement that came together is designed to make school funding more equal 
than it has been by directing a disproportionate share of Proposition 98 funds 
to school districts that are now receiving less than others. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Los Angeles Unified School District's share of the new money 
would amount to $86 per pupil. But districts such as Capistrano Unified would 
get an added $225 per student, Orange Unified would get $192, and Santa Ana 
would get $224.

More than $1.6 million earmarked for Caltrans to help plan and build three 
Orange County toll roads was held out of the state budget Friday after a 
powerful Los Angeles lawmaker said she didn't think taxpayers should help pay 
for "private" roads. 
</P>
<P>
Objections by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) to the Caltrans 
appropriation prompted her colleagues on a legislative budget conference 
committee to balk at approving the expenditure Friday. And her continued 
opposition could spell trouble for the measure next week, when the panel is 
scheduled to take it up once again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exchange With Seymour 
</P>
<P>
Waters' qualms led to a harsh exchange with state Sen. John Seymour 
(R-Anaheim), another budget committee member and chief architect of the funding 
for the toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a flushed Seymour accused Waters of holding the toll roads 
"hostage," perhaps as a bargaining chip to further her own political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get that money out of (the budget committee) if I have to kill every damn 
project she's interested in," Seymour fumed. "If she thinks she's going to 
leverage me for one of her pet interests, she's crazier than a hooty-owl. She's 
nuts!" 
</P>
<P>
Waters, who did not return telephone calls after the budget meeting, told her 
colleagues during their deliberations Friday morning that she is opposed to 
using state money for Orange County's toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (Orange County residents) want to build the roads, they should 
reimburse us for any work they're going to do for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then change the law," answered Seymour, who has maintained that the 
state should help pay because the roads must be built to state Department of 
Transportation specifications and will revert to public ownership after 
construction bonds are paid off by toll users. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.6 million at stake is state money that would pay Caltrans personnel to 
ensure that private planning and construction of the toll roads -- in all, 65 
miles of pavement along three Orange County corridors -- meet state 
specifications for grading, engineering, interchange design and thickness of 
concrete, among other concerns. The supervision is necessary if the state is to 
accept the thoroughfares after they are paid off, Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
All three toll roads are in the preliminary design stage, with the first 
construction likely to begin in late 1990 for 7.6 miles in the proposed 
Foothill Corridor that would run roughly parallel to Interstate 5 along the 
foothills of eastern Orange County. The first stretch of roadway would start at 
Sand Canyon Avenue and end at Portola Parkway, according to Donna Stubbs, 
spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridors Agencies. Construction costs of 
the three toll roads is now estimated at more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Halt Construction 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs said Friday that loss of the $1.6 million in state funding would not 
stop construction of the roads. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Stubbs said, Caltrans had eight engineers working out of the 
agency's office to help with the planning for environmental impact statements. 
But the agency cut that number to three, and may eliminate all on-site workers 
if the $1.6 million is cut from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the number of engineers was scaled back 
because the TCA is waiting for the Irvine Co. to dedicate 5,300 acres in 
Limestone Canyon as open space, a condition put on the construction of two toll 
roads by the Legislature last year. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for the toll roads hit another snag last month when state Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) urged that money requested 
for the Caltrans supervision, particularly of the San Joaquin Hills route, be 
left out of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Roberti -- an adamant opponent of toll roads -- suggested that the 
Orange County toll road authorities reimburse the state for its Caltrans 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Withdrew Request 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti withdrew his request and Seymour said the Senate leader had 
promised not to block the state funding of Caltrans involvement with the toll 
road. Everything seemed to be going forward smoothly until Friday, when the 
matter reached the conference committee, a panel of senators and Assembly 
members appointed to put the finishing touches on the state budget before it is 
sent to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Waters objected to the state funding, and Seymour reacted angrily. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Roberti no longer has a problem here and I think Ms. Waters has some 
other agenda going, and I would just like to know what it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Roberti is not on this conference committee and I am and you better try 
to satisfy my concerns," Waters retorted. "We're putting money into private 
toll roads and I don't like it."

FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE;

Tony Aliengena, bone weary after a nine-hour, 1,450-mile transoceanic flight 
that began in snow flurries in northern Canada and took him through four time 
zones, safely landed his single-engine Cessna early today in this island 
capital in the northern Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, an 11-year-old from San Juan Capistrano who is trying to become the 
youngest aviator to fly around the world, crawled out of his cramped cockpit at 
2 a.m. as a setting sun cast a pinkish glow over this seaport metropolis that 
is flanked by snow-capped peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Looking very tired, the boy, whose parents normally send him to bed at 9:30 
p.m., when asked how he felt, replied abruptly, "Good," and marched straight to 
his hotel room on the 12th day after setting out from Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, his family and an entourage from another chase plane all checked into a 
local hotel, where they are to rest today before attempting to complete the 
North Atlantic crossing Sunday with a 1,000-mile flight to Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
A second chase plane, however, was forced to turn back to an earlier refueling 
stop in Greenland after a directional compass malfunctioned during the second 
leg to Reykjavik. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine Cessna, piloted by Colorado businessman Pat Wiesner, returned 
to Sondrestrom, Greenland, where it had to be repaired and refueled before he 
could rejoin the group. Aboard his plane are three members of a Los Angeles 
film crew that is producing a documentary about Tony's flight, as well as 
Soviet journalist Alexie Grinevich. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day flight began Friday morning in Iqaluit, Canada, a remote Eskimo 
village near the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The entourage had been dreading the North Atlantic crossing ever since Tony 
departed Orange County June 5 on his Friendship Flight. It began ominously 
enough Friday, with snow flurries and blowing winds in Iqaluit, which is in 
Canada's Northwest Territories. 
</P>
<P>
At a weather briefing at the Iqaluit airport, the pilots were warned of an 
arctic storm system in their path on the way to the refueling spot in 
Sondrestrom, on Greenland's western coast. 
</P>
<P>
The storm system was showing the presence of freezing rain at higher flying 
altitudes, according to the weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions were so poor that Yves Landry, weather meteorologist at the airport 
in Iqaluit warned: "If it were me, I would stay home." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no pilots had yet traversed the ocean route that day, they were told. 
But Gary Aliengena, Tony's father and coordinator of the flight, opted to press 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before takeoff, Tony and his entourage donned orange wet suits and 
tucked life preservers behind their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's mother, who was riding in another chase plane piloted by Dr. Lance 
Allyn, explained the importance of the suits to her 10-year-old daughter, 
Alaina. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go down in the water, the water is very cold," said Susan Aliengena, as 
she helped her pony-tailed daughter into the suit. "And this will keep you from 
dying." 
</P>
<P>
After departing through gray storm clouds during light snow flurries over 
Iqaluit, the three planes emerged into clear blue skies and managed to stay 
above the storm system centered over the Davis Strait, between Canada's arctic 
islands and Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
At Sondrestrom -- a U.S. Air Force Base -- Tony descended into an eerie world 
of glacial peaks and aquamarine fjords. Also visible was the start of 
Greenland's massive icecap, which runs to a maximum thickness of two miles. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner's plane developed mechanical problems about one hour after leaving 
Sondrestrom on the 800-mile leg to Iceland, so he turned back. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony and Allyn continued on, flying closely to maintain radio contact along 
the open expanse of ocean where they were out of touch of air-traffic control 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
Tony crossed the east coast of Greenland about two hours after leaving 
Sondrestrom, soaring above a foreboding mass of jagged peaks that abutted a 
seemingly endless expanse of frozen ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean ice was breaking from the June thaw and was dotted with icebergs. 
Soon though, the ocean was concealed from view by a thick layer of low-lying 
clouds, which stretched to the Icelandic coast. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while flying through clear skies, Allyn glanced down at the ice 
and tapped the dashboard of his twin-engine Beechcraft King Air lovingly. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we can stay up here, I don't know," Allyn said. 
</P>
<P>
While halfway over the ocean, Maxim Chikin, another Soviet journalist 
accompanying the flight, leaned his head into Allyn's cockpit and asked 
nervously: "Where is land." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after two long hours of cold ocean flight, the snowy cliffs of western 
Iceland emerged into view. Chikin rolled his eyes in relief. 
</P>
<P>

GARDEN GROVE, BUDDHIST MONK GO EYE-TO-EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years ago, the Venerable Thich Phap-Chau left Vietnam for the greater 
religious freedom in the United States. Now, as leader of one of the largest 
Vietnamese Buddhist congregations in Orange County, the monk has become 
embroiled in a dispute with Garden Grove city officials that may land him in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing conflict concerns Chua Viet Nam, a monastery/temple that Phap-Chau 
opened six years ago in a run-down two-bedroom home surrounded by weeds on a 
one-acre lot at 12292 Magnolia Ave. in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints From Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
While several other churches operate along the busy thoroughfare, neighbors 
have complained to city officials about dust and noise resulting from people 
who park on the dirt areas of Phap-Chau's lot on Sundays, according to Janet 
Solow, Garden Grove's code enforcement supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, Eileen Schwarzenberger, said she felt she had no right to 
complain because she lives on a busy, public street. But she added that 
Phap-Chau's "lot is not as big as his following," and many cars that do not fit 
on the lot or on Magnolia Avenue spill onto side streets. Phap-Chau said 30 to 
40 people usually attend Sunday afternoon services. 
</P>
<P>
Solow said city officials had "numerous contacts" in person and in writing, 
explaining to the monk that his home was classified for residential use and 
could not be used for large gatherings of people who regularly attend services. 
Moreover, an inspection uncovered numerous building and fire code deficiencies 
including unpermitted bedrooms, bathrooms, a patio and improper electrical 
wiring," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posts Signs, Notice 
</P>
<P>
Partly complying, the monk installed a fire extinguisher, exit signs and a 
notice on the patio door -- which reads, "This door must remain unlocked during 
business hours" -- next to the candle-lit altar with golden statues haloed in 
neon. 
</P>
<P>
But Phap-Chau, whose English is limited, continued to operate the temple, which 
he said serves 2,000 families. "I cannot stop them come here," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
The monk, who said he is raising funds to build a proper temple on the lot, 
contends that he doesn't have the funds to comply with the city's requirements. 
Moreover, moving to a temporary location would be like abandoning holy ground, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandaled and smiling, Phap-Chau tried to explain the situation in an interview 
in his office, which is next to the worship center where pictures of members' 
relatives hang on the wall above offerings of fruit and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the walls are photos of First Lady Barbara Bush and Gov. George 
Deukmejian standing with Phap-Chau, who is president of the Vietnamese American 
Buddhist Assn. of Orange County, and is known by acquaintances as being "very 
nice" and "very religious." 
</P>
<P>
He showed a letter from Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) congratulating 
him on Buddha's 2,533rd birthday this month. 
</P>
<P>
Phap-Chau pulled out maps and drawings of a $1-million temple he plans to build 
in a year or so at the rear of the one-acre lot. He said he has raised $200,000 
toward the new temple, which presumably would be the largest Vietnamese 
Buddhist temple in Orange County. Members have pledged $100,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Will Build' 
</P>
<P>
Because he intends to build a new temple, Phap-Chau said he thinks city 
officials should be patient with him. "I do not lie. I am a Buddhist monk. I 
will build." 
</P>
<P>
While city officials believe Phap-Chau understands the laws, the monk said he 
was confused. "This year, they talk one way. Next year, they talk another way," 
he said. "They make it difficult for me." 
</P>
<P>
In February, on the first Sunday after the Vietnamese New Year, a city official 
gave Phap-Chau a misdemeanor citation after one particularly holy service. 
Phap-Chau said congregation members were surprised to see the citation given, 
and some were angry and felt it was a bad omen for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
But Solow said the citation, which was not the first issued to the monk, was 
issued during regular weekend rounds and that the code enforcement officer 
waited until the religious service was over. 
</P>
<P>
In two citations, the city has charged the monk with improper land use and city 
code violations, misdemeanors that carry a maximum sentence of $500 or six 
months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial Set for July 12 
</P>
<P>
Phap-Chau has pleaded not guilty and the case, continued three times, is 
scheduled for trial July 12. 
</P>
<P>
"If he'd make the improvements, it would all go away. It's purely a safety 
issue as far as we're concerned," said J. Dan Lilley, deputy city attorney. "We 
won't give up until the corrections are made." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove city planners have approved Phap-Chau's site plan, but won't issue 
a building permit until Phap-Chau improves or tears down the house, or moves. 
</P>
<P>
Phap-Chau explained that moving the temple even temporarily would disturb the 
holy nature of the temple, where ancestors are worshipped. 
</P>
<P>
Others say the bottom line is money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Catch-22," said his attorney, Tim Ryan of Huntington Beach, who has 
taken on the case at no charge. "To fix the house would take money away from 
building the temple. 
</P>
<P>
"What he doesn't want to do is lose parishioners. If he had to move the temple, 
he might lose parishioners and he might lose money." Congregation members give 
contributions when the monk prays for dead spirits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gathering Area' 
</P>
<P>
Once built, the new temple will be a "real central gathering area for a lot of 
Vietnamese Buddhists in area. I think he'll be a great leader for them." In the 
meantime, Ryan is urging Phap-Chau to comply with the city's orders. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him strict directions: He has to get out and vacate the premises. The 
city will not issue the permit to build the temple until the improvements are 
made." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ryan, who communicates with the monk through interpreters, 
Phap-Chau simply has not understood that the city means business. Each time the 
case has been continued, "He thinks he's gotten a major victory." 
</P>
<P>
If the monk is served with a temporary restraining order, a notice to vacate, 
or other official documents, something the attorney said is likely before the 
trial date, Ryan predicted that the monk will "realize they mean business." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who said he thought he had persuaded Phap-Chau to comply, expressed 
surprise to hear that the monk was still resisting. 
</P>
<P>
"I can predict with 100% certainty the city will take much more aggressive 
action over this whole matter," Ryan said.

AIRPORT INQUIRY MAY DELAY FOOD SERVICES PACT AT JOHN WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lucrative contract for food services at the new John Wayne Airport terminal 
scheduled to open next year may be delayed because of an inquiry into alleged 
misuse of minority contractor rules at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials identified Andy M. Camacho on Friday as the proposed 
minority partner for Host International Inc. at the new John Wayne terminal. 
Camacho, a Los Angeles resident who is a political ally of Los Angeles 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, is also a partner in a LAX concession now being 
reviewed by Los Angeles Airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's anything wrong, and he'll probably still get the 
contract here, but just to be safe we're going to run it by the Federal 
Aviation Administration's civil rights office," said Kathie Rutherford, John 
Wayne Airport spokeswoman. "We won't sign the contract until the FAA is 
satisfied with it." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Orange County's proposed minority-owned business contract 
with Camacho requires him to engage in hands-on management of Host's John Wayne 
Airport franchise. The minority business contracts at LAX have come under fire 
for allegedly allowing Camacho and others to serve as mere figureheads and not 
active corporate officials, contrary to the intent of federal 
disadvantaged/minority business enterprise regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said airport officials believe that the John Wayne contract meets 
all regulations imposed by the FAA on minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Joubert Jr., the FAA's regional civil rights officer, said his office 
will review John Wayne Airport's minority-owned business contracts at the 
request of Orange County officials. He said he does not know when the review 
will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend them for it," Joubert said of the county's decision to seek a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet what was contained in L.A. contracts, so I can't make a 
comparison with the John Wayne situation," Joubert said. "John Wayne Airport 
asked us to take a look at their contracts to make sure that the content 
prescribes levels of participation for joint venture partners. We said we'd 
keep them advised, but the final call is John Wayne Airport's. And so far 
they've done everything they're supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors selected Host International last March to operate a 
9,188-square-foot central food and beverage area, including a restaurant in the 
new passenger terminal scheduled to open April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the board selected McDonald's to operate the new terminal's 
fast-food stands, which will be physically separated from the central food and 
beverage area operated by Host International. 
</P>
<P>
Host will also operate two cocktail bars at both ends of the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Host's contract with Orange County anticipates that the Los Angeles-based firm 
will gross $4.2 million during the first year of operation at John Wayne. The 
county will receive at least $760,000 a year from the Host contract.

<P>
A Yorba Linda man suspected of robberies followed by assaults on women 
employees at dozens of small businesses in Los Angeles and Orange counties was 
arrested Friday by a special investigations team of the Buena Park police. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Michael Gross, 27, was taken into custody at 9:30 a.m. while at work at 
a McDonnell Douglas facility in Long Beach, police spokesman Lt. Rich McMillen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said Gross was being held without bail in the Huntington Beach city 
jail on suspicion of 47 robberies and assaults between last November and this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Gross was taken to Huntington Beach because several of the robberies took place 
there, McMillen said. He said Gross was suspected of committing other robberies 
and assaults in Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Seal Beach, Cypress, Los Alamitos, La 
Palma, Long Beach and in other parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The total take in the robberies came to between $2,000 and $3,000, McMillen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross allegedly chose small businesses staffed by lone women to rob, using a 
steak knife to demand money and then taking the women into rear storerooms to 
attempt to molest them, McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The crimes were believed to be related due to similar circumstances and 
suspect description," he said. "Common in most of the descriptions of the 
suspect was noticeable body odor." In one of the robberies, McMillen said Gross 
allegedly wore a McDonnell Douglas work shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Using information supplied by other police agencies, Buena Park investigators 
tracked Gross down to the McDonnell Douglas facility in Long Beach and arrested 
him without incident.

COIN DEALERSHIP SLAYINGS; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE BELIEVE MARINE ACTED ALONE IN DEATHS 
</P>

<P>
An Orange County prosecutor said Friday that a young Tustin Marine appears to 
be the only suspect in a "robbery gone awry" that left two people dead and a 
third wounded at a Newport Beach rare coin dealership in March. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Jon Wick, a 20-year-old son of a Reno-based FBI agent, made his first 
appearance in an Orange County courtroom Friday to answer charges that he 
murdered two people and wounded another during a robbery at the Newport Coin 
Exchange on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing Levi's and a white T-shirt, and sporting a traditional Marine Corps 
crew cut, the young lance corporal asked to be represented by a public 
defender. His scheduled arraignment was postponed one week. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery and burglary in the deaths 
of Clyde Oatts, 45, of Irvine, Renee Ratoon King, 38, and the wounding of her 
37-year-old husband, William D. King, owner of the coin business. The Kings 
lived in Orange at the time of the shootings. Police said at the time that all 
three were shot execution style in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris said he will seek two special-circumstance 
charges of murder during the commission of a felony, and a third 
special-circumstance charge of multiple murder. Those charges mean Wick could 
face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
A Nevada attorney who said he will be assisting in the defense of Wick said 
they will seek to prove that police have apprehended the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
"Identification is absolutely a factor," Fred Gibson III, a private attorney 
who said he has known the Wick family for several years, said in a telephone 
interview from Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach detectives have sought to link Wick to the slayings through his 
fingerprints, which they say were found on a receipt for the purchase of some 
coins and on a display case at the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Gibson, a former federal prosecutor in Nevada, dismissed that evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The place where the shooting took place is a publicly available facility and 
just because a person's prints were found doesn't mean that person perpetrated 
a crime," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred in the coin exchange offices on MacArthur Boulevard near 
John Wayne Airport. Wick is being held without bail in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested June 8 by military investigators at his family's Reno home 
after he left the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Station without leave, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who said he expects to arrive in Orange County next week, said he has 
talked to Wick several times since his arrest but would not characterize his 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect's father, FBI agent Bruce Wick, mother and two younger sisters were 
left "terribly distraught and shocked" by the arrest, Gibson said. "The family 
is together and are doing their best to put themselves back together." 
</P>
<P>
Police have said they believe robbery was the motive for the attack and are 
trying to link several valuable coins and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapon 
found in Wick's possession to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Wick has no record of convictions for any previous offenses, Borris said. Steve 
Merrill, Marine spokesman at the Tustin base, said Wick has never been 
court-martialed. Any instances of lesser disciplinary action would not be made 
public, Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
On active duty since May 4, 1988, Wick was a small-arms repairman assigned to 
the armory. Merrill said Wick had never been a member of a military shooting 
team and did not have the qualifications to use a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
"Most lance corporals are not (qualified for using handguns) and there is no 
requirement that you need to be an expert shot to be a weapons repairman," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill said the Marine Corps will not act to discharge Wick unless he is 
convicted of the civilian charges. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Borris said it is not known whether William King will be able to 
testify for the prosecution if the case comes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
King is recovering at home from gunshot wounds to the head and chest suffered 
during the assault. 
</P>
<P>
"He suffered severe head wounds and we haven't pressed him a lot (in the 
investigation)," Borris said. "We have no idea if he will be well enough to 
testify."

SENATE AIMS REBUKE AT ASSEMBLYMAN JOHNSON'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an extraordinary rebuke aimed at apparent anti-Semitic remarks made by 
Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, an agitated Senate on 
Friday unanimously approved a resolution urging legislators to avoid derogatory 
language in conducting their business. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution identified Johnson by name and directly quoted controversial 
remarks he made the previous day to Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who is 
Jewish and who accused Johnson of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution did not, however, criticize Johnson personally. Instead, it 
merely expressed the Senate's resolve to "assiduously avoid any conduct that 
could reasonably be expected to be offensive to any diverse element of our 
population." 
</P>
<P>
In a hushed chamber after a 20-minute discussion, the Senate voted bipartisan 
32-0 approval of the unusual statement, which is not binding on anyone but is 
intended to discourage "derogatory appellations" in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
Only minutes before, Johnson, one of the most combative members of the 
Legislature, made a public apology to the Senate-Assembly budget conference 
committee of which Robbins is a member. Robbins, however, did not hear it 
because he was on the Senate floor awaiting action on the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Robbins, no stranger to controversies that he concedes he helped to 
create, demurred on whether he would accept the apology, insisting only that "I 
have no desire to prolong this." 
</P>
<P>
"If I said anything that was interpreted or could have been interpreted as 
having been a slur on anyone's religious preferences or ethnic background, I 
most sincerely apologize," Johnson told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
But he told reporters he would never apologize for confronting Robbins in the 
committee on Thursday "on his inappropriate and quite possibly illegal behavior 
toward members of the Assembly Republican caucus." 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Robbins abused his position as one of the Legislature's six 
state budget writers to "bully and browbeat" Assembly Republicans as they came 
before the committee one by one to seek funds for locally popular projects in 
their districts, such as parks. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins targeted members of the Assembly GOP because they had refused to give 
their permission for reconsideration of a high-priority Robbins insurance bill 
that was killed earlier in the lower chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson learned of Robbins' conduct in the budget committee and charged angrily 
into the hearing room, where he greeted Robbins as "Senator Torquemada," a 
reference to Tomas de Torquemada, a leader of the bloody Spanish Inquisition 
against Jews in the late 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins took offense at the remark, to which Johnson shot back: "Maybe, 
senator, I should have referred to Sammy Glick." Glick was a central figure in 
the 1941 novel "What Makes Sammy Run" and was portrayed as an utterly ambitious 
and ruthless film mogul who was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
After the Senate action on the resolution, sponsored by his longtime ally in 
the San Fernando Valley, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), Robbins defended his 
conduct in dealing with Assembly Republicans and seemed to affirm the 
legislative adage: "Reward your friends and punish your enemies." 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he believed that the Assembly Republicans had dealt with his 
insurance measure "unfairly" and that as a state budget writer, "obviously I'm 
more receptive to someone who has given me a fair shake." 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, nerves fray and tempers flare as lawmakers fight to see that their 
interests are provided for in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
But this time around, pressures seem to loom larger, especially as the FBI and 
U.S. attorney press their investigations into suspected corruption in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Johnson charged that Robbins, a potential contender 
next year for the state insurance commissioner's post, was trying to divert 
attention away from a story in Thursday's Los Angeles Times reporting that the 
Van Nuys Democrat is a subject of the FBI probe. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Robbins had "chosen for political reasons to make a great issue 
out of something that I suspect in his heart he knows is utter nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Teri Burns, a spokeswoman for Robbins, later denied that notion. "He took it 
(Johnson's remarks) very personally. It wasn't related to other issues," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare for either house of the Legislature to take on one of its members 
publicly, although plenty of backbiting occurs in private. The last time one 
chamber directly criticized a member in public occurred in 1981 when the Senate 
reprimanded former Sen. John Schmitz (R-Corona del Mar) for issuing a press 
release that described an audience at an abortion hearing as composed of "a sea 
of hard Jewish and (arguably) female faces" and using such terms as queer, 
butch and bull dykes. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the resolution on Friday, Davis noted that the measure fell far 
short of criticizing Johnson and zeroed in on his remarks that "could easily be 
construed as anti-Semitic." 
</P>
<P>
He said that derogatory racial or religious remarks have no place in 
legislative deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times like this that I think real men and real women have to stand 
up and take positions," Davis told the Senate, adding that no one asked him to 
introduce the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Views 
</P>
<P>
Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), one of the Senate's two black members, agreed, 
declaring that "we cannot tolerate in jest or in sincerity any insensitive 
remark." However, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who is Jewish and 
co-authored a successful political reform ballot initiative with Johnson, 
defended the embattled Republican and asserted that the resolution was 
unnecessary because Johnson had apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"Assemblyman Johnson says there isn't an anti-Semitic bone in his body, and I 
believe that," said Kopp, who ended up voting for the measure. "All of us are 
subject to the vicissitudes of simple momentary loss of rational discourse."

OVERFLOW CROWD SHOWS UP FOR SPEEDWAY RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radio personalities Mark and Brian helped attract a crowd of 9,200 to Friday's 
speedway program at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. More than 
1,000 spectators reportedly were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Faria of Colton won the four-lap scratch main event with Steve Lucero of 
Riverside finishing second, Brad Oxley of San Clemente taking third and Shawn 
McConnell of Brea taking fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ermolenko of Cypress won the eight-lap handicap main event. Oxley was 
second, Shawn McConnell from Brea was third and Faria was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Mark and Brian, of KLOS-FM, failed in an attempt to jump two motorcycles in a 
bus because the ramp broke. 
</P>
<P>
The last sellout for speedway at the Fairgrounds was in 1981, when Bruce 
Penhall returned from winning the world championships in London, England.

VOLLEYBALL ON THE BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COAST COURTS FEATURE SOME OF HOTTEST COMPETITION UNDER THE SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
They say that 47-year-old Roy Crump has a beach volleyball rule book in his 
head, and an eye for the lines as precise as any tape measure. 
</P>
<P>
He has been surfing since the 1950s and playing two-man volleyball on the sand 
since the '70s. And with his teen-aged son, Jay, Crump still commands reverence 
from the kids at the crowded Lake Street courts in Huntington Beach, a spot 
just south of the pier so popular that a challenger's wait in the summer can 
stretch to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Crump is one of a group of people with early-morning jobs, night-jobs or no 
jobs at all who make up the legion of serious beach volleyball players up and 
down the Orange County coast. They are waiters and telemarketers, students and 
coaches, pro players, pool cleaners and self-proclaimed real estate 
speculators. Crump is the latter, and he and his son live a nomadic life split 
mostly between Oahu's North Shore and a house within strolling distance of the 
Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are numerous private courts in Orange County, most are public. 
The standard is poles only, provided by the county or the beach cities, none 
more than the City of Newport Beach, which maintains 58 sets of poles, more 
than half of which are strung along the sand in West Newport. 
</P>
<P>
Usually you must bring your own net and, if you are inclined, ropes to mark the 
court boundaries in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge match is the standard, with the winner holding the court. Games 
are to 11 or 15, depending upon the number of people waiting. Self-officiating 
is the rule, putting you on your honor to call your own net violations or 
illegal sets. 
</P>
<P>
The courts are as varied as the people who play on them. Up in Seal Beach, 
there's a court some kids know as "Old Man's," where those whose skills surpass 
their stamina are said to play. All along the stretch of West Newport, there 
are courts known by numbered streets. One, at 52nd Street, is said to thrive 
when a sometime resident -- known simply as Chuck to most -- is in town, always 
attracting highly competitive players. 
</P>
<P>
With the passing summers, courts' reputations shift and change like the sands 
they're built on, but some endure as a sure place to find good competition. 
</P>
<P>
A look at five of the best in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
Lake Street, Huntington Beach: Serious players disdain the double court here 
because the net runs "the wrong way" -- parallel to the ocean rather than 
perpendicular to it. Built as it is, the wind blows down the length of the 
court, forcing balls to sail too long from one side and making it possible to 
serve a severe drop ball into the wind from the other. 
</P>
<P>
But the ample parking (with fee) and proximity to the pier make it a popular 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
The double court allows "work-up" challenges, which speed the play and increase 
the competition. In work-ups, the winner from Court 1 advances to play the 
winner at Court 2, with two new teams playing on Court 1 for the right to 
challenge the next winner on Court 2. 
</P>
<P>
The players here are typically high-school age or slightly older, and the court 
is only occasionally visited by professional players. 
</P>
<P>
But the popularity of the spot makes it unpopular with some local players. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like the place to go if you have a bus pass," said Steve Pemper, 21, 
who played volleyball at Huntington Beach High School and briefly at Cal State 
Long Beach. "Anything that close to the pier, everyone comes there from Encino 
or Covina." 
</P>
<P>
Colton Street, Newport Beach: "Just say it's too weak," said Steve Neptune, a 
28-year-old professional player as he lounged in the sand. "Just say, 'Don't go 
to Colton Street.' " 
</P>
<P>
Many people consider the double court at Colton Street, just south of the Santa 
Ana River jetty, to be the home of the best competition in Orange County. But 
although people here are friendly, it has a reputation as an insider's court, 
almost a private club on a public beach, where the competition is keen and 
newcomers are not always welcome -- unless they're very good. 
</P>
<P>
Even on an overcast day, you can find high-caliber competition here. Among 
those who dropped by to play or watch one recent day were Carlos Briceno, Adam 
Lockwood and Laura Phillips, former area high-school players who now play for 
the University of Hawaii; Albert Gasparian, who coaches at Golden West College, 
and Rick Ownbey, 31, a former Savanna High School and Rancho Santiago College 
pitcher who started 16 games in the major leagues and is now thinking of trying 
professional beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, it's a good spot," Ownbey said. "There's parking, 
bathrooms and showers nearby and a pizza shop across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar State Beach: Known as Big Corona, this large crescent-shaped 
beach just east of the jetty at the entrance to Newport Harbor has 10 courts. 
The eight new sets of bright-blue poles at the north end of the beach allow the 
height of the net to be adjusted, and are popular with company and family 
outings -- what more serious players sometimes call "hack ball" or "jungle 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
This is a good spot for groups because challenges are not the standard. If you 
bring your own net and ropes, holding the court for your group is usually 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
At the south end of the beach, there are two courts where two-man challenges 
are the norm and the competition is better. These are the courts where longtime 
Corona del Mar locals tend to play. 
</P>
<P>
There is a parking lot (with fee) and street parking nearby. Big Corona is 
particularly popular in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
Main Beach, Laguna: The net strung between two palms here may be the most 
picturesque along the coast, and as the home of the 35-year-old Laguna Beach 
Open tournament, Laguna has a spot of its own in the lore of beach volleyball. 
The city of Laguna Beach maintains three courts -- four during tournaments -- 
and also provides nets and rope boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Although Laguna at times has been clearly the home of the best local 
competition, insiders' opinions vary on the current level of play. But this is 
as certain a spot as any to see professional players, including Karch Kiraly, 
who lives in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The level of play occasionally excludes players who are not rated by volleyball 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"That's sort of Russian roulette there," said Bill Ashen, who coaches the men's 
team at UC Irvine. "If you lose, you're usually going to sit down the rest of 
the day. You might as well go to another beach." 
</P>
<P>
But depending on the day and time of day, less serious players often get a 
chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The better players go there and play the pros," said Jim Kemper, 18, who often 
plays at Capistrano Beach. "If you're just decent, you'd better come to Capo 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
There is street parking only, usually very crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Beach: There are 11 courts at Capistrano Beach, a county beach, nine 
of which have nets and ropes for boundary lines. 
</P>
<P>
The nets and ropes have been in place here for just more than two seasons, and 
in that time Capistrano Beach has become a popular spot for South County high 
school students. It's so popular that one high school team recently held its 
banquet on the beach here. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a popular after-school gathering spot this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
"You just walk up and say, 'Challenge,' " said Mark Gray, a senior at Dana 
Hills High who has been playing in the afternoons recently. Even during the 
summer, Gray said, the wait for a game is rarely longer than 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The younger players share the courts with a regular group of rated players -- 
mostly men in their early 20s who play some tournaments -- and with a number of 
women professionals who are drawn by the fact that at least one net here is 
always locked at women's height, which is eight inches lower than the standard 
eight-foot net. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Opalinski, 28, a professional player who teaches at Capistrano Valley 
High School, practices here a couple times a week. Occasionally, she and her 
partner, Linda Chisholm, have to fight for a court. 
</P>
<P>
"You pretty much need to be diplomatic and try to coax them off," Opalinski 
said. "If not, just challenge and beat them." 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of metered parking at the beach, and always the added 
attraction that Kiraly, one of the most famous volleyball players in the world, 
lives nearby and sometimes practices here. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen Karch here," said Kemper. "Karch is God. He could come out 
here and just toy with people." 
</P>

MORAN, SUSPENDED FOR RIDING INTOXICATED, LOSES APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speedway motorcyclist Shawn Moran of Huntington Beach, the leading rider in the 
British Speedway League, had his appeal for suspension denied Friday by a 
three-man jury representing the American Motorcycle Assn. Moran was suspended 
for the remainder of the season for racing with an excessive blood-alcohol 
content last month in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Moran was given two Breathalyzer tests by officials of the governing Federation 
of International Motorcyclists (FIM) and tested well above the allowable levels 
set by the FIM after competing in two heat races in a World Long Track 
qualifying round May 14 at Korskro, Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Moran was disqualified from the race by FIM officials and then suspended from 
all world championship events for the 1989 season by the AMA. Moran also was 
banned from competing in the World Best Pairs, World Team Cup and World Final 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Moran appealed the suspension and was allowed to compete in the American Final 
June 3 at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. The race was the first of three 
qualifying rounds for American riders that leads to the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
Moran tied Sam Ermolenko and Ronnie Correy for first place at Long Beach with 
19 points, but lost a runoff to Ermolenko and finished second. Moran will be 
replaced in the next round by reserve Rick Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"Shawn never denied the incident, he just felt the punishment didn't fit the 
crime, so he made the appeal," said Harry Oxley, International Speedway 
promoter. "He told the jury exactly what happened and we tried to convince them 
that suspending Shawn from all Long Track meetings for the year would be more 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
The jury's decision is final, according to Bill Boyce, competition director for 
the AMA.

REGULATORS INSTALL NEW PRESIDENT, BOARD AT SECURITY FEDERAL S &amp; L IN GARDEN 
GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving to shore up management at Security Federal Savings &amp; Loan, federal 
regulators installed a new president and board of directors at the Garden Grove 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The departing board appointed five new directors, at least four of whom have 
worked with troubled S&amp;Ls elsewhere for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
The new directors then hired William Verant as Security Federal's new 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Sullivan, who had been named president just two weeks ago, returned to 
his position as vice president in charge of lending. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L, which has lost money for several years, is operating with 
"marginal" capital of just over $1 million for its $78 million in assets, 
Verant said Friday after two days on the job. Regulations require it to have 
more than $2.5 million in capital, its final reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
But the thrift has earned more than $280,000 in the first five months this year 
and has a loyal core of depositors, many of whom have been with the S&amp;L 
almost since it opened in 1957, Verant said. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be turned around," he said. "It just needs more capital and a good 
business plan." 
</P>
<P>
Security Federal, hurt by a small profit margin, has few of the problems that 
have plagued many S&amp;Ls. Verant said loan delinquencies -- slow-paying loans 
-- constitute only 1% of its loan portfolio, a figure well within acceptable 
thrift standards. It also has few properties in foreclosure. Such foreclosures 
can be an indication of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Security's only major problem, Verant said, is that it has more than $2 million 
in loan losses from the early 1980s that it has been deferring. It needs 
profits against which it can write off those losses. 
</P>
<P>
Verant, 47, of Laguna Hills said he has high hopes of rebuilding Security 
Federal. He said it was a "refreshing" opportunity after managing the insolvent 
Unified Savings Bank in Northridge, which has been liquidating its assets since 
the bank board seized that institution in October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and the new and old directors met Wednesday at a board meeting, 
where regulators introduced everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Security Federal's new chairman is McKenzie Moss of Carmel. Its directors are 
real estate syndicator Janice Ramocinski of Orange, consultant Paul Hogan of 
San Francisco and Dale Welton and Dallis Widick of Lenders Technology Inc. in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Ramocinski managed North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana for regulators 
before it was closed last June. Moss, Welton and Widick have served for 
regulators on the boards of troubled thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Miller, Security Federal's president since it opened, retired from that 
position two weeks ago but remained as the S&amp;L's chairman. He and two other 
board members retired Wednesday, and two other directors resigned.

OSHA SAYS WORKERS ENDANGERED; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF CLUB MANUFACTURER CITED FOR HEALTH HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beauwood California Inc., a golf club manufacturer in Santa Ana, has been cited 
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for exposing employees to 
a dangerous compound that can lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Beauwood was cited Thursday for 16 health and safety violations that could 
result in $30,200 in penalties. John Hermanson, acting area director for the 
federal agency's Long Beach office, said the company knowingly committed at 
least two violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel they knew they were exposing their employees to the hazard and took no 
action to correct it," Hermanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Beauwood spokesman Tracy Burkhardt said the firm believes that OSHA has 
overstated the extent of the problem. "We feel this has been grossly 
exaggerated," she said. Burkhardt declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Toxic Beryllium 
</P>
<P>
According to OSHA investigators, Beauwood's workers were exposed to a highly 
toxic metal called beryllium. Some golf clubs contain a beryllium-copper alloy 
that gives off a toxic dust when it is ground or polished. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at Beauwood who ground or polished golf clubs were subject to 
conditions that could result in "eye disease, skin disease, respiratory 
irritation, irreversible lung damage, cancer or death," according to OSHA's 
citation. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the agency alleges that the company did not provide adequate 
medical care and safety equipment for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhardt said the company has shut down its grinding operation. She would not 
say when it closed, or if the employees allegedly exposed to the chemicals in 
that division still work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints by Workers 
</P>
<P>
Some workers have complained of symptoms including chest pains, itching eyes 
and rashes on the arms, according to the citation. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA said two employees were sent to a clinic in 1988 because of skin 
irritations and chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
Two workers monitored on Feb. 9 by OSHA were found to have been exposed to 
least 4.5 times the permissible amount of beryllium. 
</P>
<P>
The workers' families also may have been put at risk because beryllium sticks 
to clothing, OSHA said. 
</P>
<P>
"These employees wore ordinary street clothes and they did not shower or change 
clothes before leaving the workplace," the citation says. "Beryllium may be 
carried home on work clothes, thus prolonging worker exposure and exposing 
family members." 
</P>
<P>
Besides beryllium, OSHA found some workers were also at risk of lead 
contamination. "Their hands were discolored from the lead power," the citation 
says. 
</P>
<P>
It also says lead contamination had been found on top of the company's lunch 
table and that traces of beryllium were found inside a refrigerator used by 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Beauwood has about 20 employees and was incorporated in August, 1976, according 
to state records and officials. Documents filed with the California secretary 
of state indicate the firm's president is Lawrence Y. Igarashi. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA has given Beauwood 15 working days to file an appeal or correct the 
alleged hazards.

FROM LIDO ISLE TO BUENA PARK;

<P>
IRS WILL OFFER 18 SEIZED PROPERTIES AT AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not everyone's favorite government agency, and most people, most of the 
time, want as little as possible to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
But on June 28, the Internal Revenue Service will make it possible for a 
handful of people to pick up residential properties in Orange County at what 
may be bargain-basement prices. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS is holding a public auction of 18 properties -- ranging from a 
multimillion-dollar oceanfront home on Lido Island to a 1,450-square-foot 
condominium in Buena Park -- that have been seized from people who owe back 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
It is only the second large public auction held by the IRS in Orange County. 
And to avoid some of the problems that cropped up at the first one in March, 
the agency is conducting a pre-auction seminar on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Both the seminar and the auction will be held at the Santa Ana Police 
Department Annex auditorium, 23 Civic Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we packaged a bunch of properties for a mass auction like this, 
we had 209 registered bidders," said IRS spokeswoman Sally Ruhnau. "A lot of 
them were first-timers, and they had a lot of questions and it took a long time 
to get through it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the information to be covered at the seminar, Ruhnau said, are the 
mechanics of the auction, tips on checking out the properties and rules of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Those rules are pretty important. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the IRS doesn't guarantee that the property is vacant, and the 
successful bidder is responsible for any evicting that must be done. 
</P>
<P>
In several cases, only one owner's interest in a jointly owned property is 
being auctioned. The successful bidders for those properties will own only a 
percentage of the homes (usually half), and others -- a spouse or a business 
partner -- will retain ownership of the rest. It is helpful in that case for 
prospective bidders to make a pre-auction arrangement with the other party, 
Ruhnau said. 
</P>
<P>
One important rule is that while the winning bidder is not responsible for 
taxes owned to the IRS, he or she does assume responsibility for all other 
liens and mortgages against the property. But those bills should be factored 
into the bid, Ruhnau said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the properties to be auctioned is in an area where 
comparable homes sell for $400,000 or more. In addition to the IRS lien on the 
property -- which bidders don't have to worry about and which isn't disclosed 
-- there are two mortgages with a total balance of $247,758, plus a California 
Franchise Tax Board lien of $10,342 and two lawsuit judgments totaling $90,163. 
</P>
<P>
That adds up to a total debt of $348,263 that the successful bidder will have 
to pay off. An interested bidder should subtract at least that much from the 
market value in figuring how much to offer for the house, Ruhnau advised. 
</P>
<P>
To identify existing mortgages and liens, she said, the IRS runs a title search 
and publishes the results but does not guarantee the accuracy of the search. 
</P>
<P>
"So we will teach people how to do their own title search as well," IRS 
spokeswoman Judith Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
One other rule that is nice to know: the debtor, by law, can buy the property 
back up to 180 days from the date of the auction by repaying the successful 
bidder the price paid at auction, plus 20% annual interest and all other costs 
incurred by the bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS obtains the homes in seizure actions against people who have not paid 
back-tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
Most IRS tax liens don't result in seizures, Ruhnau said. But some people who 
get into tax trouble have borrowed so much against their homes that even in 
Southern California's strong real estate market they cannot clear enough by 
selling the properties to pay off all their debts and the IRS as well. 
</P>
<P>
That, she said, is when they let the IRS seize the property and sell it to help 
pay back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In the March auction, Golden said, winning bids for the 20 properties offered 
ranged from $30,000 to $200,000. She said the IRS sets a minimum bid that is 
based in part on the market value of the property, less liens and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Winning bidders at the June 28 auction are required to make at 20% down payment 
that same day and must pay the balance by 1 p.m. July 5, Ruhnau said. 
</P>
<P>
The auction itself will begin at 11 a.m., but bidder registration begins at 
9:30. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs and physical descriptions of the properties to be auctioned are 
posted in the lobbies of the IRS offices at the Federal Building in the Santa 
Ana Civic Center and at the Chet Holifield Federal Building in Laguna Niguel, 
she said.

BRIEFCASE: ALLEGED CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROMPTS NEW TRIAL FOR CONVICTED 
SWINDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts granted a new trial Friday to a convicted 
boiler-room swindler because of an alleged conflict of interest by the man's 
former lawyer, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas J. Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
A new trial was ordered Oct. 10 for Vincent L. Caterino of Riverside, who was 
convicted March 10 on 22 count counts of mail fraud, conspiracy and wire fraud 
in a rare-coin scheme that allegedly took in $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to Umberg, attorney David Wiechert filed a motion on behalf of 
Caterino, which accused John Stephen Elekes -- Caterino's lawyer during the 
trial -- of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, Umberg said, says that Elekes allegedly advised Caterino that his 
telemarketing business was legal after the firm, Marco Numismatics, was raided. 
During the trial, the motion said, Elekes dissuaded Caterino from testifying 
about the earlier advice. Umberg said Elekes also filed a motion denying the 
charges.

NAME DROPPERS; 
</P>
<P>
IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOURS, CHANGE IT -- THIS IS PRIME SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The young woman rose, lifted her hand and swore to tell the truth, so help her 
God. 
</P>
<P>
"Natasha's always been my favorite name," she told Superior Court Commissioner 
Julee Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
OK, but why does she want to change her last name to Lavery, Robinson wanted to 
know?. 
</P>
<P>
"Duke and Anna Lavery on 'General Hospital,' " is all the woman said, as if it 
needed no further explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The woman smiled. Robinson grinned. Courtroom spectators, including many who 
also soon would be known by different names, chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
"So ordered," the commissioner said, simultaneously killing off another 
unsatisfactory name (Patricia Leanne Watanabe) and giving birth to a new one 
(Natasha Lavery). 
</P>
<P>
For reasons not altogether clear, we have entered what appears to be Orange 
County's prime name-changing season. 
</P>
<P>
Every year in Department 3 of Orange County Superior Court, about 500 unhappily 
or unsuitably named people ask to be officially renamed. 
</P>
<P>
During spring and summer, name changes reach their peak. It's anyone's guess 
why. Officials say that people may have more time to show up for court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, motives can be rather straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Michael Scott Vail petitioned the court this year to add the name 
Merritt between his middle and last names "to qualify as an heir" under the 
will of his grandfather, Hewlitt C. Merritt. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the reasons are heart-rending. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Ana woman asked to change the last name of her children, ages 8 and 11, 
to that of their stepfather. Her reason: "They never see their real father, who 
is serving a 100-year prison sentence." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like your name, you should change it, advises Leonard Ashley, 
English professor at Brooklyn College and past president of the 1,000-member 
American Name Society, a group of linguists, literary historians, and others 
fascinated with the etymology, origin and meaning of names. 
</P>
<P>
"Your name is part of your identity," Ashley said. "You know how annoyed you 
get when somebody forgets it or misspells it. We even tip head waiters to 
remember it. 
</P>
<P>
"As a person grows up, he might not like the script that has been selected for 
him. He may not want to be a Desmond. There are these reputations that . . . go 
with the names.

"If you're running for the vice presidency, you don't want to be a Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Kristine Kern can relate to that. On Tuesday, she will become Djuna 
Renee Woods. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always hated Tiffany since I was little," she said. "It's sweet, frilly. 
It's charming, nice, pleasing. I'm trying to get away from that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a Tiffany at all . . . it just seems like daddy's little girl. It's 
also a trendy name right now. . . . I don't know any other Djuna." 
</P>
<P>
Kern appropriated her new names from her favorite female authors, Djuna Barnes 
and Renee Vivien. "I'm an English major," explained the UC Irvine senior. Her 
new last name -- Woods -- simply sounded good. 
</P>
<P>
"Both my parents will be sad," she conceded. "They spent a lot of time picking 
out my name. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the idea of being able to name myself. It's really empowering. I'm in 
the process of self-discovery. I'm 24. . . . My father, I haven't told him yet 
. . . I thought I'd send him the (legal ad) clipping" publicizing the court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to be a strong feminist and intelligent, self-sufficient," she 
said. "Now I just have to get used to calling myself Djuna." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, fathers thought they were bestowing the ultimate honor. 
</P>
<P>
"But obviously, it's tough to be a 'Junior,' " Ashley said. "First of all, you 
don't have a full individuality. And you have a father to live down or up to. 
Both of these are difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while "about 4% of the United States population is a 'Junior,' 10% of 
the population of insane asylums and jails are 'Juniors,' " Ashley said, 
quoting from studies conducted in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a John F. Kennedy Jr., you can have a great advantage. But at the 
same time, people are going to say to you: 'You're no Jack Kennedy.' " 
</P>
<P>
The sure-fire solution to being badly named, according to Ashley, is simply to 
change it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call yourself anything you want as long as it is not an attempt at 
fraud," he said. "So you can't call yourself Donald Trump and go into the real 
estate business." 
</P>
<P>
Although it is commonplace and quite legal to change a name simply by using a 
new one, many still seek the official imprimatur of court. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone gets his wish. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Garden Grove City Councilman Robert F. Dinsen wanted to change his 
name to Robert Frank Taxfighter Bob Dinsen but was turned down after a voter 
protested. A Superior Court judge agreed that Dinsen's name change was an 
attempt to undermine a city ordinance saying, in effect, that "taxfighter" is 
not a permissible ballot designation under the state Elections Code. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, it requires very little to change your name. 
</P>
<P>
Once you fill out the forms, you file them in Superior Court where the woman in 
charge of name changes is Charlotte Hooker, who, by the way, has no desire to 
change her name. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of Asians on behalf of their children about the time they start 
to school," Hooker said of families who are Americanizing their names. "I'm 
sure it makes it easier for the kids to fit in." 
</P>
<P>
Once the forms are filed and notice has been published in local newspaper legal 
ads, would-be name changers go before Commissioner Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Most . . . appear without attorneys," said Robinson, who has been changing 
other peoples' names for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"In some states, you have to have a good reason to change your name," she said, 
adding that in California there must only be a good reason to prevent a name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires a notification of a parent if the other parent wishes to 
change a child's name. This allows protests at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
And you can find help without hiring an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of spelling "V-e-n-k-a-t-a-r-a-m-a-n S-u-b-r-a-m-p-a-n-i-a-m over the 
phone?" ask the publishers of Nolo Press, a Berkeley firm that bills itself as 
the largest self-help publisher of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
For $14.95, you can buy Nolo Press' soft-cover book on "How to Change Your 
Name," a 120-page, do-it-yourself legal guide, first published in 1974 and in 
its fourth edition. 
</P>
<P>
People ask Robin Hood of Laguna Beach if he changed his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone wants to change his name as a kid, especially if you are 
Robin Hood and everyone wants to know where Friar Tuck is, and Maid Marian," 
said the 43-year-old chef's instructor at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
But Hood said he has been the Sherwood Forest hero's namesake since birth and 
wouldn't think of changing it now. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges, however, that his mother and father are mum on which one 
selected the moniker. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Lynne Marie Dean's friends laugh at her new name. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, 24, of Orange, works as a movie extra and aspires to perform "genuine 
acting where I'm myself and my roles are who I am -- real feeling and 
sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
She needed a good stage name. She decided to become "She-Rah Lee." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a spiritual name that I'm using," she explained. "I found She-Lah in the 
Bible . . . It didn't fit. My friend said: 'What about She-Rah?' The 'Lee' came 
from another friend." 
</P>
<P>
"My mother hates it," Dean conceded. "It's like it's demeaning or an insult . . 
. but I didn't mean it that way. The person who was brought into the world is 
not the same person I am now. I'm not that little girl anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after settling on her new name, Dean learned there was a comic strip 
character named She-Rah. No matter that her friends laugh, she decided. "My mom 
and my aunt still call me Lynn. That's fine. But to the world, I'll be 
She-Rah." 
</P>
<P>
The Name Society's Ashley feels a person is entitled to say, " 'This is my name 
and this is how I want it spelled,' and your friends should go along with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Ashley has never been keen on his own name. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it. My official name is Leonard R.N. Ashley. I have lots of 
middle initials. They name you after all your dead relatives and worse, after 
all the living relatives who can leave you money. By the way, it doesn't work. 
My relatives didn't know how to live or when to die. So don't saddle your kid 
with a lot of names. 
</P>
<P>
"All my friends call me Tim. I'm certainly glad I didn't grow up like a 
Leonard. Leonards are accountants and fussy. And, of course, Lenny is really 
stupid. He's the big nerd (in John Steinbeck's) 'Of Mice and Men.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ashley declines to take his own advice and change his name. "I have this great 
sense of family," he said, noting that his male ancestors have been Anthonys 
and Leonards for generations. "I don't have a son, but I guess I would have to 
call him Anthony or Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to give up your roots." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S IN A NAME? 
</P>
<P>
Isabelle C. Benson became Belle Star 
</P>
<P>
After a divorce, Star, who lives in Laguna Beach, didn't want to use her maiden 
name of Caestecker, which she found "too complicated." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Ann Meierhoefer became Linda Ann Meyers 
</P>
<P>
Her children had finished high school and it had been 10 years since her 
divorce, so for this Costa Mesa woman the time seemed right. Besides, she told 
the court, "there are now two other Mrs. Meierhoefers." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander J. Reyes became Sir James Bond 
</P>
<P>
This Westminster man had been known by the same name for all of his 34 years 
when he appeared in Orange County Superior Court in 1982 to change it for 
"personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Sunita became Sunita Kumar 
</P>
<P>
This India-born Costa Mesa woman had no last name to change. "There's no 
necessity to have a last name or a middle name (in India)," she said. "But over 
here I have problems. That's why I did that." She added her husband's last 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sterna became Andrew Zaborowski became Andrew Sterna 
</P>
<P>
When he immigrated as a child, this Polish-born El Toro man changed his last 
name to his stepfather's. At the age of 37, Zaborowski wants to change his name 
back to Sterna, his natural father's. "Family sentiment, I would say," he 
explained. "My stepfather's name meant nothing. . . . Why should I make the 
other name famous?"

FAMILY LIFE: FAMILY OF TOMORROW: IT WON'T BE THE JETSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember George Jetson? His boy Elroy? Daughter Judy? Jane, his wife? That 
popular cartoon family lived an idyllic 1950s existence transplanted into a 
future of flying cars, talking dogs and assertive household appliances. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the Jetsons. Instead, meet the real family of the future. Families, that 
is, because households of the 21st Century will be so diverse that no single 
family, not even a hypothetical one, can represent them all. 
</P>
<P>
For example, tomorrow's family is more likely to have one parent than two, at 
least at some point while the children are growing up, said Peter A. Morrison, 
director of the RAND Corp. Population Research Center, speaking this week at 
the Irvine Hilton. He was addressing the annual meeting of Florence Crittenton 
Services of Orange County, which provides services to troubled adolescent 
girls, many pregnant or with children, as well as abused and neglected infants 
and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a situation where basically what we now refer to as the traditional 
family of American nostalgia with a male breadwinner, full-time female 
homemaker and children really isn't there anymore," said Morrison, a 
demographer and futurist who has testified before Congress on matters related 
to the family. 
</P>
<P>
Each family of the next century may take several different forms over the 
years, he said. That same single-parent family may gain not just a step-parent 
but an extended step-family as well through marriage or remarriage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another temporary configuration may be a 21st-Century version of the 
traditional extended family, in which "adults in their 50s and 60s who are 
caring for parents in their 80s and 90s find their children in their 20s and 
30s knocking on the door, perhaps with their own children in tow" after a 
marital breakup, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Other typical families, he said, will consist simply of a husband and wife with 
no children and no plans for children. 
</P>
<P>
Families that do have children will probably stick to somewhere near the rate 
of 1.8 children per family that has held steady for almost a decade, compared 
to the rate of 3.8 at the height of the baby boom. 
</P>
<P>
Those families that do include two parents, whether they are both the child's 
natural parents or a parent and stepparent, will most likely be two-income 
families. "Three-fourths of women will be in the workplace," compared with just 
over 50% today, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
And because there won't be anyone home full time to tend to the family's needs, 
"more and more of the things families used to do for members will be left 
undone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those things that absolutely must be done will increasingly be contracted out, 
he predicts, just as many families today already must do with child care and 
other responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
As the baby boomers of the post-World War II era become the senior citizens of 
the 21st Century, more and more families will need to provide care for their 
older members as well as their younger ones, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
One shift that has already begun involves how families are formed. Although the 
most common way families begin is with marriage, an increasing number are 
started when single women give birth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, for example, single mothers accounted for 38% of births among blacks 
and 6% among whites. By 1986, that number had grown to 61% for blacks and 16% 
for whites. And recently, the rate has increased particularly among "mature, 
single white women in their 20s and 30s," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many women who have a stronger desire to have a child than to have a 
husband," he said. He cited a recent survey which found that "50% of the women 
in that group said they would consider having a child without a partner if they 
were nearing the end of their childbearing years." 
</P>
<P>
Whether formed intentionally or as a result of marital breakups or unintended 
pregnancies, Morrison said single-parent families, and the children who live in 
them, will be more vulnerable because they will be dependent on only one 
working adult. "That implicitly exposes the family to a potential to lapse into 
poverty in the event of unemployment or anything going wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And because a single adult's income usually can't match that of a dual-income 
family, single-parent families will also have more difficulty paying for 
services that once were provided by housewives, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Families formed with two adults may not stay that way, Morrison said. 
"Marriages are not likely to last a lifetime. People are divorcing more readily 
and they're divorcing earlier." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, 21% of women ages 25 to 29 had been divorced, and it was projected 
that 33% more would follow suit at some point in their lives. Among women 35 to 
39, 32% had already divorced and 24% were expected to do so. But of women 45 to 
49, only 29% had divorced and 7% were expected to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a "steady decline in the average age of divorcing couples," 
Morrison said. Among women who are now 55 years old, 25% had been divorced by 
age 43. But women who are now 35 reached that same 25% level at age 29, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those divorces are "usually followed by a second marriage and a resumption of 
married life," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of today's children will spend some part of their youth in single-parent 
families," he said. Among children born from 1950 to 1954, 48% of blacks and 
19% of whites spent some part of their childhoods with only one parent. For 
children born in 1980, those numbers have jumped to 94% of blacks and 70% of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
What it all comes down to, Morrison said, is that families will be more complex 
as well as more diverse. "There will be a lot more intrinsic complexity in the 
obligations that go with the relationships in families." 
</P>
<P>
He predicts that families in general will be more dependent on the public 
sector for help with both child care and care for the elderly.

JOSEPH N. BELL: FILM RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF DISCIPLINE IN 
CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a summer that promises us ghostbusters, batmobiles and a contest with the 
Nazis for the Holy Grail, "Dead Poets Society" arrives like a breath of cooler 
summer air. 
</P>
<P>
It requires us to think. And from the size of the line around the theater when 
we saw it last week, a lot of people are ready to be thus challenged. I suppose 
the case could be made that a fair number of them think they are going to see 
Robin Williams' shtick, but if that was true in the audience that attended with 
us, they got caught up totally. They applauded when the film was over, a 
phenomenon almost as rare as an Orange County Democrat winning public office. 
</P>
<P>
Our little group was rather sharply divided in what we took away from the film, 
and that's OK, too. Any piece of commercial entertainment that can produce such 
a result is -- by my definition -- highly successful. 
</P>
<P>
If you've seen the film or read the reviews in Calendar, you know that the 
central figure is a highly charismatic teacher in a boy's prep school who turns 
his students on to poetry and beyond that to some rather highly individualistic 
expression with mixed -- and in one instance tragic -- results. Whether the 
teacher was responsible for the resultant behavior -- rather than some 
excessively despotic parents and school authorities -- is the central question 
raised by the movie. 
</P>
<P>
But I found a corollary question more interesting -- and less easy to answer: 
At what point can we turn young people loose with the heady brew of 
free-wheeling individual expression in the assurance that they have the 
concomitant mental and physical discipline and sense of history to use it 
either wisely or effectively? It's a question that recurs repeatedly to a 
teacher and one I struggled with through two decades of teaching students at UC 
Irvine, hopefully, to become better writers. 
</P>
<P>
This question was raised pointedly in a brief exchange between the Robin 
Williams character and another, older teacher who is bemused by Williams' 
teaching technique. He warns Williams that "discipline and tradition" must come 
first; Williams answers with a bit of poetry eulogizing the freedom of creative 
thinking. Williams' argument is, of course, more exciting, more exhilarating -- 
and more persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
But it all reminded me of an incident that took place when my daughter was in 
the sixth grade. She brought home a charming little story she had written in 
English class. The teacher had given her an A+, and although the story was 
delightful, it was full of misspellings, confused syntax and grammatical 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
I made an appointment with the teacher and said I didn't think my daughter 
should have been given so high a grade on a paper with so many errors. The 
teacher replied that the class was in creative writing, and my daughter's work 
was highly creative. I said that creativity can be muffled and even stifled 
without the proper tools of expression and the students shouldn't be allowed to 
think they weren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
It was a standoff. I'm sure the teacher felt I was the one stifling my 
daughter's creativity -- and I suspect a few of my students over the years felt 
the same way when I insisted they learn the tools first. 
</P>
<P>
By an odd coincidence, some of the same questions are raised in a quite 
different context by another current Orange County entertainment: South Coast 
Repertory's "Sunday in the Park With George." The first act devotes itself to 
the single-minded expression of the creative process and how it affects people 
in the artist's life. The second act deals with those who would bastardize, 
commercialize, standardize, and trivialize creative work. But throughout both 
acts, the recurring theme expressed repeatedly by the artist is the importance 
to the creative process of seven qualities: "Order, design, tension, 
composition, balance, light and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Even when the artist is told by the woman who loves him: 
</P>
<P>
 Stop worrying if your vision is new. 
</P>
<P>
 Let others make that decision -- 
</P>
<P>
 They usually do. 
</P>
<P>
 You keep moving on ... 
</P>
<P>
 He returns to these seven precepts as the qualities that will enable him to 
"move on." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the boys whose spirits were lifted by the teacher in "Dead Poets 
Society," it seemed to me, still lacked many of these qualities (although this 
isn't necessarily a matter of age) and therefore found total liberation 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as it did to my daughter's sixth-grade teacher, such an attitude comes off 
as stifling. I only wish that the parents and school administrators in "Dead 
Poets Society" could be less rigid, less myopic, more compassionate. There is 
something to be said on their behalf, but the characters thus drawn have no 
chance to compete with the persuasiveness of the charismatic teacher. 
</P>
<P>
But thank God for an occasional work that reaches out to a mass audience and 
causes it to think. Just as "Field of Dreams" offered food for the soul, "Dead 
Poets Society" offers food for the mind.
