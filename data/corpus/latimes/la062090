Sierra Madre, the hamlet at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, is evidently 
a bit quieter than L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Madre News "Police Blotter" lists mostly infractions such as bicycle 
thefts, public drunkenness and an occasional house burglary. There was not a 
single entry for June 8, though. 
</P>
<P>
As the newspaper explained: 
</P>
<P>
"No major crimes were reported." 
</P>
<P>
More in keeping with the spirit of the Big City is the Southern California 
Business Opportunity Guide, a compendium of job and investment opportunities. 
The publication depicts a gunman on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. school board members at their Monday meeting postponed discussion of a 
proposal to keep sessions from going past 9 p.m. Reason: They didn't have any 
time to discuss it. The board, wrestling with the 1990-91 budget, met until 
10:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Who wears short shorts?" was the philosophical question raised by the Royal 
Teens in their best-selling record of 1958. Now the issue may go to court. 
</P>
<P>
Venice attorney Stephen Yagman filed suit after he was denied entrance to the 
California Institute for Women at Frontera to take a deposition from a client. 
The state -- in a 64-page answer to Yagman's suit -- said the attorney was 
wearing "short shorts" in violation of prison rules. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman, who is asking that he be reimbursed for his expenses in preparing for 
and traveling to the aborted session, says he was clad in "khaki L. L. Bean 
walking shorts, whose inseam (measures) 11.5 inches . . . the bottoms of which 
are three inches from the tops of my knee caps . . . hardly 'short shorts.' " 
</P>
<P>
No word on whether the Royal Teens will be called to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Eisaman of Beverly Hills found an eye-catching misspelling on the corner of 
Beverly Glen and Sunset boulevards (see photo). What's really sad is that the 
booboo is just a few blocks from UCLA -- and the eyes of all those 
impressionable students. 
</P>
<P>
Mention here of the 1928 Newhall train robbery, one of the last in the state, 
stirred memories for George Drabble of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
On a Boy Scout camp-out back then, he got a thorn in his leg that required 
treatment in the nearby town of Acton. On the hike "down the mountain, we met a 
horse and rider," Drabble recalled. "He asked us for directions to Big Tujunga. 
Like good Boy Scouts, we knelt in the dirt and drew him a map. He thanked us 
and took off. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
That night, back at the campsite, "we were awakened by horses, flashlights and 
armed men. It was a sheriff's posse looking for a train robber. They described 
the man we had assisted. He had stolen a horse from a Saugus ranch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine the unmerciful ribbing we took. There was talk of a special 
merit badge for train robbery, but it was never approved!"

Give me a break! Poindexter deliberately subverted the will of our elected 
government, the U.S. Congress. He did this for his own political ends and 
nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
These people involved in this Iran-Contra scandal committed acts that border on 
treason. It seems incredible then that the harshest jail term (in fact, the 
only jail term) is a mere six months. Isn't this the era when we're supposed to 
"get tough" on criminals? 
</P>
<P>
The judge feels that poor Poindexter has suffered enough in legal costs (Part 
A, June 12). It obviously paid off for him. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe less obvious, but surely apt: This looks convincingly like another 
case of rich, white men taking care of their own. From the President on down to 
the sentencing judge -- what a sham! 
</P>
<P>
Where is the justice when I can count on spending a few years in jail if I get 
caught taking drugs to numb my mind to this kind of hypocrisy.

Once again, we see that individuals accused and convicted of "white-collar 
crimes" are treated differently from those individuals charged with other 
criminal offenses. If you look at the consequences of the conduct of Poindexter 
and the other "convicts" of the Iran-Contra affair, you see the following: 
People were killed as a result of their participation in the military conduct 
on behalf of the Contras; people were killed by those who were acting on behalf 
of the Contras; Poindexter and others actually conspired to violate the Boland 
Amendment which prohibited aid to the Contras; and Poindexter covered up all of 
these atrocities and lied to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Did you notice his sigh of relief when he was sentenced to only six months in 
custody? Of course, he was allowed to remain free on bail pending his appeals. 
The bottom line is there is a different -- preferential if you will -- 
treatment for white-collar criminals that is inherent in our criminal justice 
system.

I hate to tell you fellows, but none of today's guns are covered by the Second 
Amendment.

Now, if you have a single-shot cap and ball pistol or a single-shot, 
muzzle-loading rifle you're covered. Anything else is not covered.

These were the guns the Second Amendment was written for; that's all there were

<P>
Thank you for your short but succinct editorial on the sentencing of John 
Poindexter ("Admiral Was Far Off Course," June 12). 
</P>
<P>
There was hope that this trial would raise the still unanswered questions of 
the Iran-Contra scandal and publicize how our institutions failed to get to the 
bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the preceding trials of Oliver North, Richard Secord, Albert Hakim and 
Joseph Fernandez, claims of national security have been used to cover up 
criminal activity. Those who still consider these men as heroes seem to have 
forgotten that, as your editorial points out, the very foundation of American 
constitutionalism is shaken when the checks and balances are ignored. George 
McGovern has called Iran-Contra, "The greatest constitutional crisis since the 
Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
Now a little justice has been meted out but it leaves relatively untouched and 
unpunished the high-ranking government officials who have put themselves above 
the law by hiding from prosecution behind the cloak of national security. 
</P>
<P>
We can only hope that the non-government case still to be tried, the Christic 
Institute civil suit, will go forward. Its goal is a worthy one: to insure that 
the abuses committed in the Iran-Contra affair will be prevented in the future 
and that national security will once again become security for the nation 
rather than security from prosecution for those who commit crimes in the name 
of patriotism.

O'CONNOR'S MORAL CLARITY; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: THE CARDINAL PROPERLY MAKES IT CLEAR THAT POLITICIANS MUST SOMETIMES 
CHOOSE BETWEEN GOD AND STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAL THOMAS, Cal Thomas writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, has warned Catholic 
politicians they risk excommunication if they persist in supporting abortion 
rights. Catholic canon law automatically excommunicates any Catholic who 
"formally participates" in an abortion, knowing of the church sanctions against 
the procedure, but this is the first time such a high church official has 
suggested excommunication for Catholic politicians who refuse to make abortions 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
At first, this may appear to be an unwise intrusion of the church on the state, 
but Cardinal O'Connor is limiting his threat to a basic moral teaching and 
calling on Catholic politicians to choose between God and the state. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Kennedy said that if faced with an issue that forced him to choose 
between the church and his duties as President, he would resign the presidency. 
That is the attitude Cardinal O'Connor is seeking to restore. 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. Harold Hughes (D-Iowa), an evangelical Protestant, confronted a 
similar dilemma during the 1972 presidential race. He said he could not 
reconcile the possibility that as President, he might have to retaliate against 
an enemy that launched a nuclear attack on America. Rather than compromise his 
faith, he withdrew from the race. 
</P>
<P>
Writing on "The Limits of Dissent" in the June issue of Crisis magazine, a 
conservative Catholic publication, Bishop John J. Meyers of Peoria, Ill., says, 
"There is, and can be, no such thing as an authentic 'pro-choice' Catholic. . . 
. The primary, general responsibilities of those in public authority are to do 
no injustices and, within the limits of their authority, to work for justice. 
Catholics who hold public office cannot legitimately support legislation or any 
public policy which deprives unborn children of their basic right to life. . . 
. Catholics who publicly dissent from the Church's teaching on the right to 
life of all unborn children should recognize that they have freely chosen by 
their own actions to separate themselves from what the Catholic Church believes 
and teaches" (emphasis his). 
</P>
<P>
Though it is seldom practiced, there is ample precedent in Protestant and 
Catholic faiths for expelling people from churches if they go against central 
doctrines. The authority comes from Matthew 18:15-17: "If your brother sins 
against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he 
listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take 
one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the 
testimony of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it 
to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you 
would a pagan or a tax collector." 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the most prominent, but by no 
means the only offender in the "I'm personally opposed to abortion, but" 
category already has chosen whom he will serve. Cuomo responded to Cardinal 
O'Connor's statement by saying that while "it is profoundly disconcerting . . . 
it is not going to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church is right to turn up the heat and to remind Catholic 
politicians and others that as Bishop John Meyers says: "From the ethical point 
of view, there is no distinction between being 'pro-choice' and being 
'pro-abortion.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those who persist in theological error in spite of acknowledging that what 
their church teaches is true, may continue to hold their political positions 
and their offices if the voters wish. What the Catholic Church says is that 
they may not simultaneously hold a position of good standing in the church if 
they put the state above God and pledge to the state their ultimate allegiance.

MEXICO'S CHOICE: BARBARISM OR LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death threats have recently been received in Mexico City by author Jorge G. 
Castaneda, whose commentaries frequently appear in The Times. In the latest 
episode, his secretary reported she was detained briefly by armed men who 
ordered her to warn Castaneda to stop his political writing. The threats 
inspired this editorial published Tuesday in La Opinion, a Spanish-language 
newspaper in Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
The death threats received by academic Jorge Castaneda cannot go ignored in 
Mexico by either public opinion or by the government. The episode shows that 
respect is slipping for one right essential to democracy: The right to dissent. 
This must be remedied as fast as possible. If this kind of incident is not 
cleared up, over time it invariably reaches uncontrollable levels. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari himself, and his high-level 
spokesman, Manuel Camacho Solis, hastened to condemn the incident and guarantee 
that those responsible would not go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
But these verbal commitments must be translated into action. There should be a 
rigorous, ceaseless investigation into the episode and the people connected to 
it. And the investigation must be used as a foundation for punishing those 
responsible for the crime, no matter what their station. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda is right to hold the government responsible for his safety and that 
of his family. This is clearly among the state's responsibilities to citizens. 
If that were not so, Castaneda would have to choose between taking his chances 
and taking his family's defense into his own hands. Either option is a return 
to barbarism. 
</P>
<P>
This episode takes place when human rights in Mexico have deteriorated sharply. 
It would be naive not to conclude that events such as the murder of well-known 
human rights attorney Norma Corona or the brief kidnapping of Castaneda's 
secretary by armed men anxious to make her the bearer of threats against the 
journalist are not related. 
</P>
<P>
They stem from the same mentality that allows arbitrary criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights and political freedom are also closely related. It is no accident 
that many rights violations were linked to elections in the states of Michoacan 
and Guerrero, where jailings and assassinations perpetrated by shadowy forces 
are a symptom of government insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that narcotics trafficking has contributed to human rights 
violations in Mexico and that combatting traffickers has generated a new 
damnation: The great and arbitrary power of the police forces created to combat 
drugs is a new factor in human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, nonetheless, the general public and human rights defenders 
have begun to distinguish between the war on drugs and police excesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Salinas administration has attempted to distance itself from the police and 
has condemned such criminal activity. The government, however, can't stay on 
the sidelines as events occur, pretending it has nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for President Salinas, through the recently created Human 
Rights Commission, to translate his verbal commitment to human rights and 
political freedoms into concrete measures.

JACK SMITH: MAKING WAY FOR PROGRESS AMID PAGES OF THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The die is cast. I can hear the jackhammers chattering away at the concrete 
floor of our garage. The remodeling has begun. 
</P>
<P>
I was against it. I told my wife it would take twice as long as she expected 
and cost twice as much. Besides, we didn't need it. We already had two bedrooms 
and two bathrooms -- for two people. But she wanted four bedrooms and three 
bathrooms. She was deaf to reason. 
</P>
<P>
Once we agreed to go ahead, I promised never to say another word against the 
project, no matter how bad things might turn. 
</P>
<P>
I am going to do that. If I start saying "I told you so," we will never 
celebrate another wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
One reason I thought we couldn't do it was that I thought we could never clean 
out the garage. It was stuffed to bursting with the accumulations of 40 years 
of junk. It is done. Nothing remains. Not in the garage, at least. 
</P>
<P>
My wife spent one weekend working in it. She told me to go up to the house and 
do something else. I know why. She wanted to save everything; I wanted to throw 
everything away. She knew we would have words. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor provided a plywood shed of about 6 by 7 by 7 feet. She filled it 
in one afternoon. I don't even want to know what's in it. There are also 
numerous cardboard boxes full of things I had tried to throw out. 
</P>
<P>
The most critical item in this inventory was the pile of scrapbooks in which 
she had faithfully pasted my columns for 20 years. I knew that if I threw those 
out it would set a standard: Nothing would be sacred. 
</P>
<P>
However, I mentioned that intention in a column and received a windstorm of 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dismayed at your threat to junk your scrapbooks," wrote Gladwin Hill, "and 
hope you will reconsider such a rash step. I'm sure there are any number of 
institutions that would be glad to house them, because they are an invaluable, 
unique sociological commentary on an era. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Either you're kidding or still spaced out by jet lag," wrote Jack Fulbeck. "To 
discard those scrapbooks . . . kept by your appreciative if unappreciated wife 
over the years, would be sacrilege. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Such a collection," wrote Keith Fahey, "should never be thrown away: It is 
quite certainly a treasure beyond price." 
</P>
<P>
"For goodness sake," wrote Roberta Wagner. "I can't believe you are even 
semi-serious. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And I was astounded by a letter from Msgr. Francis J. Weber, archivist of the 
Archdiocese, offering to keep them in his archives. Considering the irreverent 
nature of so many of those columns, I was touched. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was settled by my wife. I had put the several bound volumes in the 
center of the garage, with the rest of the trash to go. A day or two later they 
appeared in a stack on the patio table, without the plastic covers in which 
they were bound, by years. My wife said she had removed them to save space. The 
stack of pages was more than two feet high. 
</P>
<P>
When she was at work the next day a wind came up and blew about 100 pages off 
the top, helter-skelter. I spent 20 minutes picking them up. Now the stack is 
on her bedroom floor. I am defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Of course I never really meant to throw them away. I was only trying to suggest 
that we must be ruthless. It was she, after all, who had saved them, and for me 
to throw them away was a serious affront. I suppose I could never really have 
done it. 
</P>
<P>
I did quite well, though. I managed to give the Goodwill several hundred books 
and phonograph records, a broken toaster, a cat carrier, a box of glassware, 
six men's suits, a box of shoes, and a large carton of T-shirts and sweat 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Since first mentioning the books and phonograph records I have received several 
requests for them; I'm sorry that I acted so hastily. However, anyone who wants 
the books and records, or even the cat carrier, can probably pick them up at 
the Goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
An enormous pile of hopeless junk was gathered in the center of the garage and 
carried away -- I suppose to a landfill. I have been told that that is a sin. 
We are about out of landfill and the problem is acute. 
</P>
<P>
I do feel guilty. But what was the alternative? Sooner or later thousands of 
people are going to have to clean out their garages. They can do it today or 
they can do it 20 years from now. OK, 20 years from now how are they going to 
dispose of it? All the landfills will be full and disposing of trash will be 
against the law. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, I suppose, we will all be conditioned to recycling almost 
everything, to save the Earth. But there will always be things that are 
absolutely useless, non-biodegradable, and non-recycleable. What can one do, 
for example, with two articles I threw out -- a thick foam rubber mattress they 
gave me at the hospital after my back surgery, and the disintegrating plastic 
pool cover that we never use. Either they go out or one leaves them to one's 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I believe that one of the biggest problems of the future will be the 
junk left to children by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
At least I've tried not to do that.

* New Lease: The long-awaited reopening of Ellis Island is set for Sept. 8-9, 
Lee Iacocca, chairman emeritus of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island 
Foundation, said in New York Tuesday. The island, through which at least one 
relative of 40% of all living Americans first passed on their way to the United 
States, has been undergoing a $128-million renovation since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Ellis Island is one of America's most hallowed places," Iacocca said.

* Firsthand Experience: Watergate-conspirator-turned-minister Chuck Colson 
laments what he calls a "general breakdown in character" in business, politics 
and the church. Colson, once an aide to Richard Nixon, told a group of 
evangelical Christians in Minnesota over the weekend: "Government has become 
such a big moneyed business, a person has to do anything to survive. But that's 
not an excuse. Power corrupts. I know. I was there. I am Exhibit A." 
</P>
<P>
* Arts and Crafts: Fallen evangelist Jim Bakker, who has been making pottery 
behind bars, sent his 83-year-old father, Raleigh Bakker, a Father's Day gift 
of a vase bearing a painting of the evangelist's childhood home in Muskegon, 
Mich. Bakker, the founder of the PTL ministry, was convicted last year of fraud 
stemming from the way he raised money at PTL. 
</P>
<P>
* Arrested: The 19-year-old son of Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson has been 
arrested on charges of assaulting a 30-year-old woman on the street. Maynard 
Holbrook Jackson III was charged with simple battery Monday after a sheriff's 
deputy saw him pick up a friend, Maria Norma Duarte, and throw her to the 
ground, police said. Duarte received minor cuts on her arms and legs.

<P>
A PAEAN TO BLACK CULTURE AT HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brisk good humor, kinetic energy and deep conviction revved up "Star Spangled 
Nigger," a performance piece at Highways Monday night. The bent spoke in the 
wheel was an excess of full-throttle emoting that came across as exaggerated 
and ultimately unbelievable staginess. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of Meri Nana-Ama Danquah, a poet born in Ghana, with contributions 
by fellow performers Halima Williams and Ezra Knight, the work is a paean to 
black physicality, tenaciousness and spirituality in a frequently hostile 
American culture. 
</P>
<P>
Performed in front of an American flag, with ironic refrains quoting the Pledge 
of Allegiance and the National Anthem, the piece incorporates snippets from two 
African dances (choreographed by Yao Tamakloe) as a way of reaffirming the 
power of cultural roots. 
</P>
<P>
These segments -- in which the performers were joined by dancers Carolyn "Kemi" 
McPherson and Mark Lawson and drummer Murshid Husam-Iddin -- were more about 
exuberant spirits than the niceties of replicating indigenous styles. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, whose body moved in luscious parallel to her lyric monologue about 
sexual pleasure, later overplayed her note of anguish and rage until it lost 
its punch. But Knight's feisty, funny rap about his first name and his 
portrayal of a wild-eyed street kid who died of a gunshot and still found 
himself roaming the streets was right on. 
</P>
<P>
Danquah, shifting from wooden passivity to grim stridency, found her best mode 
as a serenely authoritative witness to memory. CATHY CURTIS

Dame Sutherland Rings Down the Curtain: Dame Joan Sutherland says she wants to 
be remembered for her voice in its prime, so she has withdrawn from her 
December appearances in Covent Garden, which were to have been the last of her 
career. The 63-year-old diva had been cast in the role of Rosalinde in "Die 
Fledermaus." Instead, her final opera appearance will be in Sydney on Oct. 2 in 
"Les Huguenots," Royal Opera House officials said. GREG BRAXTON

Iran Can't Take This Joke: Iran has asked Turkey to halt screenings of "The 
Naked Gun," which mocks the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
A Turkish government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the 
Associated Press that Iran made the request through diplomatic channels 
Saturday, a day after five movie theaters in Istanbul and one in Ankara began 
showing the film. The official said the government was considering the matter 
and would see whether it was possible to edit out the brief segment lampooning 
Khomeini. In one scene, the police detective played by Leslie Nielsen punches a 
character that looks like Khomeini and reveals a spiked punk hairdo under his 
turban. GREG BRAXTON

Mathis Doesn't Get 'Misty': Johnny Mathis may sing about getting misty, but 
don't expect him to come out in the rain. That's what officials of the new 
Anderson Civic Center in Anderson, S.C., said Tuesday, referring to a Monday 
ceremony to name a street after the singer. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Center Director Martin Durham said Mathis was to have entered the parking 
lot in a convertible Rolls-Royce to cut the ribbon for the dedication of Johnny 
Mathis Boulevard. Two live television broadcasts were scheduled. But when the 
ceremony started, rain started pouring down on the crowd. Mathis didn't want to 
get wet, and the owner of the Rolls-Royce did not want his car driven with the 
top down. "What are you going to do?" Durham said. "The rain ruined it." Mathis 
stayed in his dressing room during the ceremony to prepare for Monday night's 
concert, the first at the 4,500-seat civic center. GREG BRAXTON

Pop Star Pavarotti: Luciano Pavarotti is the new kid on the block of the 
British pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
His rendition of "Nessun dorma" from Puccini's opera "Turandot" has jumped to 
No. 3 on the singles chart, due in large part to the daily play it receives as 
the theme for the BBC's World Cup soccer coverage. The single's popularity 
propelled Pavarotti's album, "The Essential Pavarotti," to the top of the pop 
album list. Decca Records officials said this is the first time a classical 
album has hit No. 1 on the pop album chart. GREG BRAXTON

EMBASSY THEATRE TOO ROOMY FOR BLAND 'GLASSHOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greed among warring members of the richest black family in America is the 
promising comedic premise for "GlassHouse," at the Embassy Theatre in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The performances and the dialogue are fun, but the production is victimized by 
its cavernous venue. The 1,600-seat Embassy is a lovely, comfortable house -- 
for a choir or a preacher or a rally. But the acoustics are not well suited for 
dramatic dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The experience is like going to a play in a tabernacle. The huge stage 
overwhelms the set design, which attempts to convey the impression of a 
towering mansion, leaving the cast to cavort by itself in isolated pools of 
light on an empty apron of a stage. 
</P>
<P>
The maw of space engulfing the players is daunting. The effect distances the 
audience from the frantic characters wallowing in greed and chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
The plot, hatched by playwright Kenneth B. Davis and directed by Michael E. 
Whaley, is basically that seen in such recent reading-of-the-will capers as 
"Daddy's Dyin' (Who's Got the Will?)" and last year's "So Long on Lonely 
Street" in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The characters in "GlassHouse," however, are black and rich, vying for the 
inheritance of a wheelchair-bound patriarch (Tommy Ford, an otherwise strong 
actor who's literally grounded by events here). 
</P>
<P>
Cast members, notably the scheming Mark Christopher and the avaricious and 
uproarious Patricia Matthews, are vocally resonant and physically compelling. 
Also commanding attention are flavorful Stacey Johnson, willowy Kimberly Bailey 
and resourceful Charles Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
As a bonus, director Whaley plays a genuinely comic, incompetent sidekick. If 
only Whaley and the playwright would trim the narrative and tighten the pace -- 
the playing time is two hours and 15 minutes, which is 30 minutes too long for 
this kind of light farce. 
</P>
<P>
Except for only a few instances, the production is played straight enough that 
the characters could be of any color. This is the show's basic disappointment. 
It's all very well that nothing is different under the skin, that greed, 
passion and love and hate are raceless and colorless. But where are the 
dynamics of black culture in this family comedy? "GlassHouse" is a slapstick 
"Cosby Show." It's the neutering of cultural definition. 
</P>
<P>
 At 851 S. Grand Ave., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., through 
July 1. $17.50-$25. (213) 935-9682.

'DIVORCE' OFFERS SOME IRONIC COUNSELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possibility of divorce can save marriages. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happens in "Let's Get a Divorce" ("Divorcons"), a 110-year-old 
farce by Victorien Sardou and Emile de Najac. It has been revived at Santa 
Paula Theater Center without the sharp sense of style that it deserves, but its 
clever ironies still create a modicum of amusement. 
</P>
<P>
Cyprienne (Rachel Babcock) is tired of her two-year marriage to the older Henri 
(Richard Livingston). She's attracted to his dashing younger cousin Adhemar 
(Brian James Schwartz) -- and she vows to change husbands, as soon as divorce 
becomes legal. 
</P>
<P>
But Henri outwits his wife and her lover. He gives them his blessing. Suddenly, 
in Cyprienne's eyes, he assumes the role of sophisticate, while Adhemar is 
reduced to a jealous, fumbling would-be husband. 
</P>
<P>
The play is ultimately more romantic than the usual knockabout farce. This 
aspect of it may seem out of date in the age of "War of the Roses." Still, some 
couples do remarry after spending enough time apart from each other. "Let's Get 
a Divorce" condenses the psychology of such cases into three mostly well-made 
acts, throwing in just the right amount of exaggeration to qualify as a farce. 
</P>
<P>
After a colorless first act, Babcock develops a giddy charm, and she delivers 
Cyprienne's pointed commentaries on the sexual double standard with fine 
fervor. Schwartz strikes some funny poses, and Livingston makes a well-charted 
transformation from fuming tyrant to urbane hero. 
</P>
<P>
But Livingston also stumbled over some of the wordplay last Saturday. Director 
David Ralphe has eliminated a few pages of cutting comments about the 
roadblocks to divorce proposed in the then-new French laws, but his staging 
still needs quicker pacing, as well as a more professional supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Ralphe's choices are overdone, such as when a servant laughs 
hysterically over an offstage event, inadvertently underlining how much more 
amused he is than the audience at that point. Yet other elements are underdone, 
such as Richard Gregg's set. 
</P>
<P>
Flaws notwithstanding, the play is so seldom staged that it may be worth the 
drive for followers of French farce. Though George Bernard Shaw ridiculed the 
work of co-author Sardou as "sardoodledom," the Santa Paula production is good 
enough to demonstrate that this play deserves another look. 
</P>
<P>
 At 125 S. Seventh St., Santa Paula, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., 
Sundays at 2:30 p.m., through July 29. $11; (805) 525-4645.

LAWSUITS SEEK MILLIONS FROM FLOWER RANCH; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND LAWYERS FOR 27 MEXICAN WORKERS WHO SAY THEY 
WERE VIRTUALLY ENSLAVED AT THE SOMIS FARM RELY ON AN OLD ANTI-RACKETEERING LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office and lawyers representing 27 
Mexican laborers who say they worked as virtual slaves at a Somis flower ranch 
filed lawsuits Tuesday that seek millions of dollars in damages from the 
Griffith-Ives Co. and its owners. 
</P>
<P>
California Rural Legal Assistance lawyers filed a federal lawsuit in Los 
Angeles against ranch owners Edwin M. Ives, his wife, Dolly, seven former ranch 
overseers and an Oxnard man accused of smuggling laborers into the country to 
work at the 50-acre Somis compound. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 defendants, except Dolly Ives and one former ranch foreman, also have 
been charged by a federal grand jury with criminal violations of the laborers' 
civil rights. They have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Wilson, the Iveses' attorney, said: "We feel that none of these 
violations have occurred, and I feel the company will be vindicated." He 
declined to comment on specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In their lawsuit, legal-assistance lawyers describe the ranch owners and their 
former employees as the "Griffith-Ives Peonage Ring." 
</P>
<P>
The suit maintains that Edwin Ives and his employees recruited workers from 
impoverished villages in Mexico, imprisoned them at the ranch until smuggling 
fees were paid, forced them to work for less than the minimum wage and coerced 
them into buying food and sundries at inflated prices from a company store. 
</P>
<P>
"Defendants engaged in this fraudulent scheme repeatedly over the course of at 
least six years to exploit dozens, if not hundreds, of migrant workers," the 
lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is unusual, not only because of its claims of enslavement but because 
it invokes a federal anti-racketeering law passed more than three decades ago 
for use against mobsters, said Marco Antonio Abarca, an attorney for the 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
If violations of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) are 
found, the workers could be awarded damages three times the $300,000 in back 
wages they claim to have lost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' fees, which may amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, also could 
be awarded under the anti-racketeering law, Abarca said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, working in coordination with 
the workers' lawyers, filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court 
that accuses Ives and his company of fraudulent business practices. It asks for 
penalties and fines that Bradbury said could reach several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, Ives could be fined $2,500 for each violation. Bradbury said 
that theoretically each day worked by the 27 laborers could be a violation. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure they're hit in the pocketbook and not just by the 
individual plaintiffs," Bradbury said. "The message is that the full weight of 
the state is going to come down on people who conduct themselves in this 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney said his office will assist the laborers' attorneys -- 
the CRLA lawyers and co-counsel from the Los Angeles firm of Munger, Tolles 
&amp; Olson -- as the county develops its case against Ives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fact-finding capability they don't have, primarily through law 
enforcement sources and contacts. And we intend to share whatever we discover," 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the laborers' lawsuit are the Griffith-Ives Co., the Iveses, alleged 
smuggler Mauro Casares and former ranch employees Parmjit Singh, Rony Havive, 
Alvaro Ruiz, Najuum Issac, and brothers Pedro and David Pinzon. Former foreman 
Jose Sandoval is also a defendant, but he was not charged with a criminal 
offense.

THE DROUGHT RATIONING; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY SHOWS HOW TO END WATER SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura's strict water rationing policy could be relaxed as early 
as next January if a plan to tap into unused ground-water supplies goes as 
scheduled, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A city-commissioned study on short-term water sources shows that the city could 
make up its 4,000 acre-foot water shortfall by purchasing water from the Alta 
Mutual Water Co. and from an agricultural well, and by adding a well to its 
golf course reservoir on the east end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the new water will allow them to lift the building moratorium 
and the limits on daily water consumption imposed in April after a four-year 
drought dried up the Ventura River, which used to be the east end's main 
source. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we can lift the water rationing restrictions by January of 1991," 
Mayor Richard Francis said Tuesday. "That may be optimistic, but I like 
optimism." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Baker added, "There might be some relaxation of the water 
rationing. But it depends on the rainfall and the timing of these new water 
sources being available." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn McPherson from Boyle Engineering Corp. told the council Monday that its 
recently completed study showed that the Ventura River's 4,000 acre-foot 
shortfall could be made up by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
By then, he said, the city could be operating a new golf course well that would 
yield 2,000 acre-feet of water a year, and it could be connected to an Alta 
Mutual well yielding 2,400 acre-feet a year and an agricultural well yielding 
400 acre-feet a year. 
</P>
<P>
"And these are conservative estimates," McPherson told the council. "We could 
probably come up with more water." An acre-foot of water typically takes care 
of the yearly water needs of a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Cathy Bean, a member of the city's ad-hoc water committee that is 
responsible for overseeing the water study, said the results are encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably ease the restrictions on water use and allow some 
development," she said. The water rationing ordinance imposed a moratorium on 
all new water hookups in the city, bringing development to a virtual 
standstill. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who is also an ad-hoc water committee member, 
said he would wait for the early spring rainfall before relaxing restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a normal rain season, then it would be reasonable to relax the 
ordinance, but we wouldn't do it until April," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials cautioned that the Boyle study only identifies 
emergency short-term supplies and that some conservation efforts will have to 
continue until the city adopts a permanent, long-term solution such as hooking 
up to the State Water Project or building a desalination plant. Either project 
would take years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger with this report is that people might seize on it in the most 
optimistic fashion and say 'We're home free,' " Villeneuve said. 
</P>
<P>
Other city officials, still concerned with overdrafting Ventura's depleted 
aquifers, said they would oppose any significant changes in the water 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I would only support a minimal relaxation of the ordinance when the new water 
becomes available," Councilman Todd Collart said. "I would still try to 
maintain a basic threshold of 294 gallons a day for single-family homes and 196 
gallons for multifamily homes." 
</P>
<P>
But the city could liberalize by allowing more exemptions for water users who 
can demonstrate that water rationing is causing them undue hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John McWherter said he would oppose any easing of water use 
restrictions until the city's long-term problems are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we replenish our aquifers, I would certainly not vote for lifting any 
water restrictions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the water crisis is not going to get worse, not that the 
crisis is over."

SUPERVISORS ALTER STANCE, BACK MERGER OF UTILITIES; 
</P>
<P>
AIR QUALITY: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON PROMISES TO CUT POLLUTANTS TO OFFSET 
THOSE GENERATED BY THE MERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Despite objections from environmentalists, the Board of Supervisors Tuesday 
approved an agreement that virtually removes the county's opposition to the 
proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego's chief power 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the supervisors had threatened to battle the merger between 
Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric unless serious flaws in a state study 
of the deal were corrected. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the state Public Utilities Commission, board Chairwoman Madge L. 
Schaefer charged that the study "may significantly underestimate the expected 
air quality impacts in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, the supervisors voted unanimously to sign an agreement requiring 
Edison to reduce certain pollutants by specified percentages, more than 
compensating for increases expected as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
This, in effect, means that the board is going along with the merger, board 
members said after Tuesday's supervisors meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution mitigation standards agreed upon Tuesday are based on the same 
figures that were criticized May 29 by the board and Air Pollution Control 
Officer Richard H. Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more comfortable with the model those figures are based on today than I 
was three weeks ago," Baldwin said, explaining his endorsement of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer agreed, saying, "I think this is the best deal we could get. We're 
requiring Edison to more than make up for the pollution increases that will be 
caused by the merger." 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger, Edison's generating plants at Ormond Beach and Mandalay in 
south Oxnard are expected to pour an additional 2,885 tons of nitrogen oxide 
into the county's air over the next 17 years. Production at these plants is 
scheduled to rise while that at less efficient facilities in San Diego would be 
curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, net emissions are expected to increase in the early years of the 
merger but decrease after that. 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement approved Tuesday, Edison would reduce overall nitrogen oxide 
emissions at its plants and elsewhere in the county by at least 45% more than 
the increase predicted in the PUC's draft environmental impact report. Reactive 
organic compounds would be reduced by 2,300% and carbon monoxide by 500% over 
the 17-year period. The deal must still be approved by the commission when it 
rules on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists at the board meeting argued that the county should delay 
reaching terms with Edison at least until after the final environmental impact 
report is issued June 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's prudent legislation to gamble on a matter this serious," 
said Russ Baggerly, executive director of the Environmental Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Critics questioned Edison's plan to reduce smog by helping businesses replace 
internal-combustion engines with electric units. "They won't even tell us where 
these engines are located," said Baggerly's wife, Pat, an Environmental 
Coalition director. 
</P>
<P>
She said after the meeting that "the supervisors have sold our air. They didn't 
even listen to the environmentalists." 
</P>
<P>
Michael M. Hertel, Edison's environmental affairs manager, told the supervisors 
that the agreement "would be the equivalent of removing 12,000 cars driving 
15,000 miles a year from the county's streets."

DEVELOPER-CITY DEAL MAY REMAIN SECRET

A Ventura County Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that the city of Thousand 
Oaks will not be forced to disclose the details of its dealings with a 
developer -- who wants to build a hotel and office complex at the proposed 
civic center -- if a formal negotiating agreement is signed by July 20. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bruce A. Thompson said that as long as the city and Lowe Development 
Corp. sign the agreement stating that they are continuing their talks, he would 
not grant a petition of former Planning Commissioner Heinrich (Corky) Charles 
to force the city to make public its records on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he did not want to ruin the deal between the city and the 
developer, which he said would occur if the negotiations are disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Charles said he wanted the details of the negotiations because he doubts that 
Lowe is serious about building an office complex and hotel at the Jungleland 
site on Thousand Oaks Boulevard at Conejo School Road, possibly placing the 
city's civic center development in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no deal," said Charles, who opposes the city's Jungleland project. 
"We wanted to smoke them out." 
</P>
<P>
But development company officials said they are committed to building the hotel 
and office complex. A Japanese businessman is considering financing the 
project, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Mark G. Sellers said after the hearing Tuesday that he already has 
an agreement prepared for officials to sign. TINA DAUNT

Arraignment was delayed Monday for a former top official of the Japanese city 
of Nagoya who is accused of stealing $450 in leather goods from a gift shop at 
Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Yukio Umemura did not appear in court in Los Angeles for the brief hearing on 
the grand theft charge. The ex-official's arraignment was rescheduled for July 
3. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged April 14 shoplifting incident, which occurred just before Umemura 
was to board a flight to Japan, was followed by his resignation as chairman of 
the Nagoya City Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Umemura faces up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

SCHOOL TRUSTEES OK PLAN TO AVERT $1.1-MILLION CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six local schools averted a financial crisis when the San Diego city schools 
trustees approved a proposal Tuesday to postpone the impending cutoff of $1.1 
million in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will give the school district the opportunity to bring its 
eligibility criteria into line with federal requirements so the schools can 
requalify this fall for the Chapter 1 funds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good likelihood that these schools will requalify next year," said 
Noble Shade, director of the district's external funding department. "We were 
trying to find ways to bring back this money, and we're satisfied with this 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the measure unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter 1 funding is supplemental money earmarked for schools that 
predominantly serve low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego school officials developed the proposal during the past three weeks 
with the California Department of Education and the U.S. Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
An increase in the district's Chapter 1 allocation also means that 16 more 
schools -- 10 elementary, five middle and one senior high -- will receive the 
special federal funds in the 1990-91 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
A federal audit in February revealed that San Diego used improper criteria to 
distribute some of the $23 million that the school district receives under the 
Chapter 1 program. 
</P>
<P>
In late April, federal auditors sent notice that the school district must 
redistribute the $1.1 million to its other schools that meet federal poverty 
guidelines in order to continue receiving all of the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
The federal audit originally said the district must rank schools for 
eligibility based on poverty levels -- as measured by the number of students 
who qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches -- rather than by combining 
poverty data with academic achievement, 
</P>
<P>
The district has used the combination of data for years but was audited on the 
procedure only this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, the school district can keep its criteria but must 
consider students in all grades. Because the district cannot include 
secondary-level test scores -- not all those students take the necessary state 
exams -- the district will assess the number of middle school students eligible 
for free or reduced-price lunches. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 1 cutback would have had an especially harsh impact because the 
school district was not afforded the traditional one-year funding phase-out 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The schools facing financial cutbacks were Bell Junior High School and Boone, 
Field, Lee, Penn and Paradise Hills elementary schools. All but Field are in 
the Paradise Hills area and have predominantly Filipino enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
The funding losses would have meant cutbacks in many educational support 
programs at the schools, including computer labs, library time and classroom 
aides. 
</P>
<P>
The newly eligible schools are Adams, Barnard, Bayview, Terrace, Carver, 
Franklin, Freese, Jefferson, Johnson, Ocean Beach and McKinley elementary 
schools; Farb, Marston, Correia, O'Farrell and Pacific Beach middle schools; 
and Clairemont High School.

A couple that operates a rubbish company were arrested Monday for ignoring more 
than 100 misdemeanor citations for dangerous equipment violations and other 
offenses involving their fleet of garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Banuelos, 61, and his wife Elsie, 58, own AB Rubbish Disposal Service in

<P>
City Atty. James Hahn said the couple operated "trucks weighing over 25 tons 
with faulty steering, holes in tires down to the cord, no brakes, no head 
lights and no horns, being driven around Los Angeles by unqualified drivers 
without liability insurance."

TEDDY BEARS TO ANSWER ALARMS WITH SAN DIEGO FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staff at San Diego's Fire Station 18 got some extra helpers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of quelling fires, the helpers will be called upon to quell the tears 
of frightened children that the station's firefighters encounter. 
</P>
<P>
The helpers are teddy bears, and the San Diego Fire Department hopes they will 
provide comfort to child victims in a way that human firefighters cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Fire trucks leaving Station 18 and 16 other stations around town will now carry 
the teddy bears along with their axes, hoses and other equipment, said Al 
MacDonald, a spokesman for the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
If a truck's captain sees a child who has been hurt, separated from his parents 
or otherwise traumatized, he'll give the child one of the bears, MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bears give them something to hold, something to comfort them," MacDonald 
said. "It makes a real big impression on the kids." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of giving teddy bears to dejected children isn't a new one; police and 
fire departments in several cities across the country are now giving bears 
away. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego officials first considered the practice after the local chapter of 
Telephone Pioneers of America approached them last December. 
</P>
<P>
After conversations with employees in a Florida fire department about the 
bears' fitness for duty, San Diego officials decided to give them a three-month 
trial at 17 stations, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the summer, the department should have a good enough estimate of 
the demand for the bears so that each of the city's 42 stations can be fully 
stocked, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The bears are all manufactured and donated by the Telephone Pioneers, a group 
of retired telephone company employees who work for a number of charitable 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
The bears, with "Hug me, I'm yours" embroidered onto them, will be available in 
any color as long as it isn't red, said Mary Bernritter, the group's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"The children will already be traumatized, and red could represent fire or 
blood," Bernritter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the bears to be their friends."

OFFICIALS TO NARROW LIST OF CAMPUS SITES

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of California State University said Tuesday that they hope to choose 
three or four possible sites for a campus in Ventura County by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
A Sacramento consulting firm, EIP Associates, will study each site's effect on 
pollution, traffic, water use and other services. 
</P>
<P>
The firm should recommend a site to the Cal State trustees by July 1, 1991, 
said David E. Leveille, the university director of institutional relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our list of 31 sites still on the table, and if there are additional 
sites offered, they would be part of the review process as well," Leveille 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees decided in Long Beach on Monday that the Taylor Ranch, formerly the 
preferred site for the campus, will now be one of the final three or four. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees withdrew their support for the 465-acre ranch property west of the 
city of Ventura after uncooperative owners threatened a lengthy court battle 
over the property. The trustees said they were also influenced by community 
opposition to the site and division on the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The university has formed a committee of Ventura County people that includes 
mayors and city government staff members as well as opponents and supporters of 
the Taylor Ranch site. JOANNA MILLER

SCHOOL GETS GRANT TO COMBAT SMOKING

<P>
The Gateway Community School in Camarillo, a county-run school for students at 
risk of dropping out, has received a state grant of nearly $75,000 to help 
reduce cigarette smoking among its 375 students. 
</P>
<P>
The grant, awarded by the Critical Health Initiatives Unit of the state 
Department of Education, comes from money generated by cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99, passed in 1988, added 25 cents a pack tax on cigarettes to 
finance special school programs, said Patricia Navarro, an analyst with the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
The Gateway school will receive the $74,825 over a two-year period to fund its 
Personal Wellness Project, said Phillip Gore, the school director. The school 
will hire two part-time instructors who will teach physical fitness and 
instruct students about the adverse health effects of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Students who have passed initial stages of the yearlong course will serve as 
peer counselors for other students, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway students, who are in the seventh through 12th grades, are referred to 
the campus near the Camarillo Airport from traditional schools for a variety of 
reasons. Some students have attendance or disciplinary problems, others work 
full time, are pregnant or parents, have served jail time or are recovering 
from drug dependency. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a relation between cigarette smoking and other high-risk behaviors," 
Gore said. "Basically, we just want to promote healthy lifestyles." 
</P>
<P>
The school offers job training, counseling, child care and an independent 
course of study that allows students to set their own hours and to work at 
their own pace. Housed in a series of Quonset huts, the year-round school will 
be moved in July into a new $2.1-million facility, also near the airport.

BOARD RECEIVES PLAN TO CUT TRAFFIC

<TEXT>
<P>
A consultant's report recommending ways in which Ventura County can cut down on 
the commuter traffic of 6,000 county employees was accepted by the Board of 
Supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the board stopped short of implementing any of the 18 suggestions in the 
car-pooling plan. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it ordered the heads of county agencies to report back next week on 
how the plan could be implemented at work sites countywide. 
</P>
<P>
The Applied Management and Planning Group of Los Angeles provided the 
supervisors with a list of suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
They include: 
</P>
<P>
* Guaranteeing a ride home for car-poolers who work late and for personal 
emergencies; 
</P>
<P>
* Providing lockers and shower facilities to those who jog or bicycle to work; 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing employees to work at home; 
</P>
<P>
* Allocating preferential car-pool parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors have until July 1 to prepare a report for the Air Pollution 
Control District in which they outline a specific plan to reduce pollution by 
lessening traffic. 
</P>
<P>
According to the planning group, implementing all of the strategies would 
reduce solo commuting by 24%, and the county estimates it would cost up to $1 
million.

Dr. Peter Stopher, who headed the team that prepared the report, said shifting 
to a workweek of four 10-hour days or condensing 80 hours of work into nine 
days has met with very favorable reviews from county employees in a pilot 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees like it because they only work a couple more hours per day and 
then get a full-day vacation," he said. "It's good for the public because the 
government offices would be open two extra hours per day and are therefore more 
accessible. And just think, if everyone did this, traffic would be reduced by 
20%." MAYA RADEVICH

PANEL ORDERS MONITORING OF PROJECT NEAR 'LOST VILLAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city Building and Safety Commission on Tuesday ordered that experts monitor 
earthmoving at a Ventura Boulevard building project near the "Lost Village of 
Encino" archeological site for possible discovery of Indian artifacts -- 
despite a prominent archeologist's testimony that a pre-construction survey was 
preferable. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also held that the Building and Safety Department made no 
mistake when it issued a building permit for the project without requiring an 
initial archeological investigation, although the city Planning Department had 
previously said the proposed construction site "is located within a sensitive 
area envelope for archeological resources." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Raab, director of the Center for Public Archeology at Cal State 
Northridge, spoke at the commission's 90-minute hearing in Van Nuys, 
unsuccessfully urging that a preliminary survey be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Raab also said he was troubled by the Building and Safety Department's apparent 
failure to acknowledge the proximity of the "Lost Village," a major 
archeological find in 1984 in which more than 1 million Indian artifacts were 
unearthed at the southeast corner of Ventura and Balboa boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The nearby construction project cleared by the department is a block away, on 
the north side of Ventura Boulevard at La Maida Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the history of these locations, the proximity to the discovery across 
the street, I think it was imprudent to issue a 'negative declaration,' " Raab 
said, referring to the city's finding that no preliminary environmental or 
archeological studies were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In taking its action Tuesday, the commission followed the recommendations of a 
Planning Department committee, which said both an archeologist and an American 
Indian representative should monitor grading and any other underground work. 
</P>
<P>
Under the adopted recommendations, the archeologist will be authorized to stop 
construction for 90 days if artifacts are found. The commission would have to 
approve any longer building delays. 
</P>
<P>
Raab had suggested that before construction begins, a series of small holes or 
trenches could be dug for a sampling of what lies underground -- and to ensure 
that any artifacts be protected from heavy building and grading equipment. He 
said that procedure often costs less and takes less time than the monitoring 
recommended by the Planning Department. Artifacts lose much of their scientific 
value if they are not studied where they are found, which helps place the 
objects in context, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raab's proposal was the method favored by neighborhood activists, some of whom 
oppose construction of the three-story, 48,000-square-foot office building. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Maurice Cohen of Studio City told the commission he was eager to 
begin construction, had already hired an archeologist, and would go along with 
either plan. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear the commission was going to approve the monitoring system, 
Cohen objected to the archeologist's power to halt construction and to the need 
for a daily Indian observer, but the commission overruled him.

AIR FORCE STILL PREFERS TRUCKING OF ROCKET FUEL; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY: OFFICIALS SAY HAULING THE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THROUGH SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA IS PREFERABLE TO MOVING IT BY BARGE OR RAIL. 
</P>

<P>
The Air Force has concluded that its current practice of trucking dangerous 
rocket fuel to Vandenberg Air Force Base through Southern California is 
preferable to shipping it by barge through the Panama Canal or transporting it 
by rail, Pentagon officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-month Air Force study found that transporting the volatile chemicals -- 
which are poisonous and explosive -- by barge is infeasible, although moving 
them by rail through the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County merits further 
review. But the initial assessment determined that trucking them through the 
Mojave Desert north of Los Angeles to the base near Lompoc remains the best 
option, Capt. Sigmund Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited Coast Guard regulations prohibiting bulk shipments of rocket 
fuels by barge and capital outlays needed to transport them by rail. In 
addition, it said that in an accident, either method could jeopardize more 
people than trucking because barges and rail cars would carry larger shipments 
than trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment was requested by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) in late 
1987 in response to reports that components of the fuel used to launch military 
rockets were being shipped by truck on the Ventura Freeway through the densely 
populated San Fernando Valley and northward through Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals include nitrogen tetroxide, which can be fatal if inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
Protests by elected officials over trucking the fuel components through the San 
Gabriel Valley -- across Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank -- and then through the 
San Fernando Valley and into Ventura County prompted the Air Force to redirect 
the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
A northern highway route through less-populated Barstow, Mojave, Gorman, 
Mariposa and Santa Maria was selected. 
</P>
<P>
"These propellants have been shipped via tank trailer over the nation's 
highways for more than 25 years without a single recordable accident or 
incident resulting in a spill or major loss of product while in transit," said 
the San Antonio Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio in 
an executive summary of the study. The center conducted the study for the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino has asked the House Merchant Marine Committee and Fisheries and 
Government Operations Committee to review the nearly 200-page study, which was 
completed in December and released to the lawmaker Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Lagomarsino expressed disappointment that the Air Force did 
not fully assess the idea that shipping the rocket fuel by barge could enhance 
safety. He also dismissed consideration of the rail option. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear on the face of it the rail shipment would expose many more 
people to risk than the current truck routing" by taking larger shipments of 
the fuels through more heavily populated areas than the current highway route, 
said John Doherty, a senior aide to Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
Rail shipments would be carried on the Southern Pacific railroad coastal route, 
which parallels the Ventura Freeway through the San Fernando Valley, eastern 
Ventura County and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force study assessed the operational, regulatory, and risk and safety 
factors of five means of transportation: barge containers; rail cars or 
tractor-trailers carried by barges; rail tank cars; containers or tank trucks 
on flat-bed railroad cars and one-ton cylinders or drums on rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said it did not assess whether shipping the fuel in barge 
containers would improve safety because it found that Coast Guard regulations 
prohibit the shipping of rocket fuels by barge. At the same time, it said 
transporting the fuel in rail cars or tank trucks on barges would place fewer 
people at risk because of the remoteness of the water route. 
</P>
<P>
But, it added, "Handling risk associated with barge transport appears 
considerably higher than for the rail modes, and mitigated the risk benefits of 
remote water routes." 
</P>
<P>
Doherty, however, maintained that Congress could modify the Coast Guard 
regulations and that perhaps the potential benefits of shipment by sea would 
make the effort worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety aspect was the whole reason for the study," Doherty said. "The 
risks may have been so much less compared to anything else that it would have 
justified the additional hassle." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force spokesman Adams said he was unable to respond immediately to 
Doherty's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen tetroxide is transported in 3,057-gallon trucks across seven states 
from Vicksburg, Miss., where it is manufactured, by a company under contract 
with the Air Force. As many as two rocket fuel shipments are made each month, 
depending on Vandenberg's launch schedule, although there have been none in 
1990, said Phoebe Brown, a San Antonio Air Logistics Center spokeswoman.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE APPROVES FUNDS FOR HANSEN DAM LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives approved on Tuesday a bill containing 
$272,000 for the continued development of a recreational lake at Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The House also approved language requested by Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama 
City) that directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to apply the money 
exclusively to the development of a recreational facility at the dam. 
</P>
<P>
It also directs the corps to continue a dredging operation until the dam basin 
is fully excavated, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another important step toward a lake at Hansen Dam," Berman said. 
"Restoring this recreation area remains one of my highest priorities in 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
The financing, contained in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 1990, is 
now subject to approval by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 and 1980, floods brought in millions of tons of debris into the dam, 
burying the one-time 130-acre lake.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TAX PREPARER GETS PROBATION FOR FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sylmar man who prepared fraudulent tax returns by claiming deductions for 
phony church donations was sentenced Tuesday in federal court to three years 
probation and 300 hours of community service, a spokesman with the Internal 
Revenue Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Kies, 57, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie to 
stop preparing income tax returns while he is on probation, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Kies pleaded guilty April 9 to three counts of preparing fraudulent income tax 
returns in 1983 and 1984. Kies, a tax preparer, falsely claimed that his 
clients made deductions to the Mission Church of America, which was 
incorporated in 1976 and based in Kies' house. Kies listed himself as the 
church's president and would send his clients receipts for the phony donations. 
</P>
<P>
The reported deductions saved eight clients -- most from the San Fernando 
Valley -- more than $14,000 in tax payments. Internal Revenue Service 
investigators said none of the donations were made. 
</P>
<P>
Kies' clients will be responsible for paying the back taxes, but no charges 
will be brought against them, investigators said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD AFTER ARSENAL FOUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A cache of weapons, ammunition and explosive devices was found by Los Angeles 
police officers in a North Hollywood house where a man apparently was planning 
to commit suicide, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers removed seven rifles, one shotgun and 12 handguns from the residence 
in the 6500 block of Teesdale Avenue, Lt. Michael Ranshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad was called when officers found a 
tear-gas grenade, a smoke grenade and an artillery flash simulator, which were 
safely removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the weapons were five assault-type rifles, Ranshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Police took Bruce Christison, 38, into protective custody at about 9 p.m. 
Monday after an anonymous caller reported that the man was in the house writing 
a note, with a gun nearby on the table, authorities said. Christison was placed 
under 72-hour psychiatric observation at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, 
Ranshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Ranshaw said police had not determined why Christison kept the weapons.

COUNCIL OKS LOAN OF $1.4 MILLION TO BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to lend an additional $1.4 million 
to a developer seeking to build a 241-unit subsidized housing project in Sun 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The request for the additional money was sought by the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, which stepped in a year ago to save the project by 
agreeing to lend Thomas Safran, the Brentwood-based developer, $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be built on a 9-acre site between Strathern and Lorne streets, 
has been in the works for five years. The total projected cost of the 
development is now $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
Boosting the CRA's loan by $1.4 million was needed to cover additional costs, 
including those of complying with a new city fire sprinkler ordinance.

<P>
An 18-year-old Oceanside man was killed when his speeding car collided with 
another car in Vista, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two other North County residents were seriously injured in the accident, which 
occurred at 9:20 p.m. Monday on California 78 near Emerald Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Pritchard, a MiraCosta College student, died after his car, which was 
traveling at 95 to 100 m.p.h., flipped over, slid through a fence and struck 
another car on Vista Way, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident apparently occurred as Pritchard was trying to make a lane change 
at the high speed, said Tom Kerns, a spokesman for the California Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ellen Linden, 19, of Oceanside, a passenger in Pritchard's car, and Juan 
Galindo, 23, of Vista, the driver of the car Pritchard struck, were taken to

After nearly three days of deliberations, a jury Tuesday acquitted a special 
education teacher of three sex charges involving a young woman with Down's 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court panel deadlocked on five other sex counts in the 
case against Christian Tuffli, 56, of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Tuffli was arrested in May, 1989, and charged with raping an 18-year-old 
student at the Mission Beach School, where he has taught for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A mistrial was declared Tuesday on the five remaining charges by Judge J. Perry 
Langford, who ordered Tuffli to return to court Monday for the setting of a 
date for a possible retrial. 
</P>
<P>
The three counts Tuffli was acquitted of were rape, oral copulation and 
penetration with a foreign object with an incompetent person. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors deadlocked 8 to 4 for conviction on two sex counts, and 2 to 10 for 
acquittal on the other three charges. 
</P>
<P>
Tuffli remains free on a $50,000 bond.

Another 5-gallon container washed up on an Encinitas beach Tuesday, just four 
days after a similar container of hydraulic fluid was found on Moonlight Beach, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Borgeson, a spokesman for the Encinitas Fire Department, said a city parks

Beach. The metal container was swollen from being in the sun but was not 
leaking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The container bears a warning label and a Chevron logo, but no other 
identifying marks, Borgeson said. 
</P>

A group of current and former UC San Diego employees filed suit Tuesday against 
the university, alleging that they were demoted or fired from their jobs on 
racial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, claims that the workers' civil 
rights were violated and that they were discriminated against because they are 
black, Latino and Filipino. 
</P>
<P>
It also alleges that the university misled the workers into thinking they would 
be eligible for pay raises and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which lawyers say has the potential to become a class-action claim on 
behalf of "numerous" workers, was filed on behalf of nine employees at 
university administrative facilities, classrooms and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The nine held jobs such as X-ray file clerk, painter and custodian, according 
to the suit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travel anywhere in Southern California and you are likely to see children, and 
adults too, riding in the back of pickup trucks. It's a way of life some 
places. But researchers at UC Irvine's California College of Medicine, and 
others like them around the country, have turned up some disturbing findings 
about how unsafe such travel really can be for anyone, especially children. 
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, the UCI researchers have looked at injuries to children 
taken to 10 Orange County hospitals after falls out of the back of trucks. A 
surprisingly high number of the injuries, some quite serious, occurred when 
there was no crash at all; the truck had simply hit a bump, swerved or turned a 
corner sharply. No wonder Dr. Phyllis Agran, an associate professor of 
pediatrics at the school, says, "A kid traveling in the back of a pickup truck 
is an unguided missile." 
</P>
<P>
There's already a law on the books in California that hasn't done much to keep 
youngsters from bumping their heads or sustaining more serious injury. It says 
that children under 12 may not ride in the back unless a set of dubious 
conditions are met -- for example, unless an adult is riding in the back too. 
Even so, a chaperon won't be much good if a turn or crash renders him, like the 
youngster, into another, but larger, missile. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with designing legislation to protect children in pickups is 
obvious. It's virtually impossible to legislate effectively against the appeal 
or convenience of a truck, even when people are thoughtless enough to put a 
child in the back of one on a freeway. And there are absurdities to the current 
law: For example, dogs currently must be tethered, but their 13-year-old human 
friends do not have to be restrained. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Eric Seastrand (R-Salinas), has introduced well-intentioned 
legislation that has cleared the Assembly and awaits action in the Senate. It's 
a dramatic solution: simply prohibit anyone, regardless of age, from riding in 
the back of a pickup or flatbed truck. Yet, while new legislation might close 
loopholes, it would present the same old problem. That is, how to mandate good 
judgment so widely abandoned? 
</P>
<P>
Adults have some latitude to make their own risky calls, a privilege many 
exercise in taking a chance in the back of a pickup. But children, for whom 
adults ought to be making safe and sane decisions, are another story. Those 
under 12 already are covered by a law that doesn't seem to work. So there's 
really only one place for everyone to go from there -- that's up to the front 
of the truck, by choice.

EXPERTS KEEP WARY EYE ON SOLVENT FOUND IN HAWTHORNE WELL WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trace amounts of an industrial solvent have been detected in a Hawthorne 
municipal water well in what experts are calling the first evidence of chemical 
pollution of the South Bay's underground drinking water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The solvent, trichloroethylene, was discovered in December in a Southern 
California Water Co. well at the northwest corner of the intersection of Truro 
Avenue and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a second test found no trace of the solvent in the well, which is 
used with other water sources to serve homes and businesses in Lennox, 
Hawthorne and Inglewood. Water experts plan to test the well again this month. 
</P>
<P>
The extremely low concentrations of the solvent that were found in December 
pose no threat to public health, experts say. But water officials expressed 
concern about the appearance of any contamination in the South Bay's deep 
aquifers, from which a quarter of the region's drinking water is drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first detection in the West Basin," said Thomas Salzano, manager 
of water supply services for the West Basin Municipal Water District. "My fear 
is that this could be the leading edge of some contamination that took place in 
and around the LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) area that has apparently 
found a pathway into the deeper aquifers." 
</P>
<P>
The test result was contained in an annual report on South Bay water supplies 
compiled in April by Bookman-Edmonston Engineering Inc., a Glendale consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that the finding should not be cause for immediate concern. They 
point to the follow-up testing in March, which turned up no trace of 
trichloroethylene, a chemical used mostly for industrial grease removal, or any 
other contaminant. 
</P>
<P>
When the solvent was detected in December, it appeared in concentrations of 1.2 
parts per billion, well below the 5-parts-per-billion level at which water 
providers are required to alert consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking two liters of water a day containing 5 parts per billion of the 
solvent over 70 years would cause an average of one additional cancer per 1 
million consumers, according to state Department of Health Services spokesman 
Allen Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1.2-parts-per-billion level of TCE is considered to be insignificant," 
Hirsch said. "Our public water supply (office) has declared that anything below 
5 parts per billion is safe." 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Hodges, the district superintendent for Southern California Water Co., 
said his company plans to test the Hawthorne well again this month. He said he 
was heartened by the results of the sampling conducted in March. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been a blip, so to speak, in December," Hodges said. "One of the 
biggest concerns from that test was that it might be the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
The detection of industrial solvent in one of the South Bay's estimated 46 
municipal water wells comes amid mounting concern about ground-water 
contamination in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, officials from a range of government agencies began pooling 
geologic, hydrologic and pollution data to determine whether ground-water 
cleanup in the area should be accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
Contamination from polluters, ranging from homeowners and dry cleaners to 
factories and oil refineries, has already tainted shallow ground water and 
portions of upper aquifers that are not used for drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges said the discovery of solvent in the Hawthorne well should serve as a 
warning that the South Bay may pay for its improper disposal practices.

Police in Jacksonville, Fla., released dramatic tapes of terrified office 
workers pleading for help on a 911 phone line as a gunman roamed through the 
building and shots rang out in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got an AK-47 and he's killing everyone," whispered a General Motors 
Acceptance Corp. employee as James E. Pough made his way through the auto loan 
office. Authorities said Pough, 42, blazed away with a clip-loaded .30-caliber 
semiautomatic rifle. He then killed himself with a .38-caliber revolver. Pough 
killed eight people and wounded five others before turning the gun on himself.

There were no reports of Legionnaire's disease among Lockheed Missile &amp; 
Space Co. employees, but two buildings in Sunnyvale where the dreaded bacteria 
surfaced remain closed indefinitely, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the Legionnaire's bacteria in humidifiers in two company labs 
forced the closure of both buildings on Friday. There was no estimate as to how 
soon they could be reopened, Lockheed spokesman Bob Burgess said. Of 250 
employees who were working in the buildings, 18 saw doctors for examinations, 
but none had any signs of the illness, Burgess said.

Civic leaders have agreed to pay more than $500,000 to 13 black firefighters to 
settle claims that they suffered from racist attitudes and abuse during the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 charged they were the target of physical and verbal harassment by some 
white firefighters who hassled their black peers with gorilla noises and by 
posting abusive materials in lockers. "What's truly frightening is the failure 
of the fire administration at the time to intervene in these embarrassing 
incidents of racial harassment," county Supervisor Harry Britt said. The 
settlements, involving actions that occurred between 1981 and 1988, ranged from 
$10,000 to $85,000.

Today is your last chance to beat the relatively good, 1-in-14-million odds of 
winning a multimillion-dollar Lotto jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the odds go to 1 in 23 million. Sticking to plans announced May 
22, the state-run lottery will shut down Lotto 6/49 after tonight's drawing for 
an estimated $25-million jackpot and replace it with Lotto 6/53 on Thursday, 
officials said. Players will not be able to buy a lotto ticket from 7:45 p.m. 
tonight to 9 a.m. Thursday as the lottery changes over its computers. Gamblers 
will still bet a dollar, or more, but will pick six numbers from 1 to 53 
instead of from 1 to 49.

PADRES HALT STREAKING GIANTS, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre reliever Craig Lefferts has read all of the conjecture and rumors. He's 
heard the comments in the clubhouse. Yeah, he knows all about Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
But while it might be juicy gossip to speculate that the Kansas City Rouyals 
might give up on Davis and return him to the Padres, there might be one little 
fact worth noting: 
</P>
<P>
Who needs him? 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts once again came to the Padres' rescue Tuesday night, bailing them out 
of a jam, and preserving the Padres' 4-3 lead over the San Francisco Giants, 
ending their three-game losing streak while halting the Giants' nine-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts got out of a bases-loaded jam created by Greg Harris in the seventh, 
squirmed out of his own jams in the eighth and ninth, and posted his 10th save 
of the season. He now has stranded the past 18 baserunners he has inherited. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep talking about Mark Davis," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said, "but 
Lefferts has done a hell of a job. You can't ask for anything more than he's 
given us. He's just been exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts, 4-1 with a 1.45 ERA, has kept quiet about the speculation that the 
Padres could be interested in reacquiring Davis. Hey, Davis still has a lot of 
friends in the Padre clubhouse, and he sure doesn't want to hurt anyone's 
feelings with any comments. 
</P>
<P>
But, it would be nice for once for people to consider his own, and take a good 
look at what he has done for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"All of that stuff gets kind of irritating," Lefferts said, "but what are you 
going to do? If they want to get him back, I can't stop them. But I don't think 
anyone can argue what I've done this year." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, if not for Lefferts' heroics on this night at Candlestick, the 
Padres (32-31) wouldn't be talking about catching the Cincinnati Reds. They'd 
be talking about next year. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to Lefferts, the Padres were able to forget all about their night of 
embarrassing moments. 
</P>
<P>
Such as the time in the fifth inning when Giant Manager Roger Craig sent 
pitcher Don Robinson to the plate to pinch-hit in the fifth inning. The fans, 
who normally boo him when he pitches, cheered his presence. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? The guy clobbers a homer over the left-field fence on Hurst's 
first pitch. The paid crowd of 31,164 went bonkers. And even though the Giants 
still were trailing, what was a guy to do but step out and take a curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Padre left fielder Shawn Abner's blunder in the ninth inning when 
he began walking off the field from second base thinking that Joe Carter had 
struck out. Oops. There were only two strikes on Carter, and Abner was thrown 
out easily by catcher Terry Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, and it's not exactly as if the Padres were able to sit back and admire 
their offensive exploits. After all, their four runs were scored against the 
likes of Francisco Oliveras and Bob Knepper. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, any time your biggest power-hitter of the evening is pitcher Greg 
Harris, who entered the game with a .031 batting average with one hit in 32 
career at-bats, you don't do a whole lot of boasting. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who believes the last time he ever got an extra-base hit was back in 
Siler City, N.C. when he played in high school, led off the the seventh inning 
with a triple into the left-center gap. The ball rolled all of the way to the 
fence, and he didn't stop running until he slid head-first into third. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first triple by a Padre pitcher since Oct. 1, 1985 when Dave 
Dravecky accomplished the feat against Rick Honeycutt at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Harris could still use a refresher course on baserunning. Gwynn 
followed Harris' triple by hitting a sinking single into left field that was 
trapped by Kevin Mitchell. But instead of scoring, Harris stayed put, believing 
that Mitchell caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, Harris scored anyway on Bip Roberts' ground ball to second, giving the 
Padres a much-needed two-run cushion, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, after being thwarted by Lefferts in the seventh, came right back in 
the eighth. Kevin Mitchell opened the inning with a single to left, but 
Lefferts appeared that he would remain unscathed when he induced pop-ups by 
Matt Williams, Mark Litton and Robbie Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
One little problem. When Thompson hit his popup to short left-center field, and 
shortstop Garry Templeton, left fielder Shawn Abner and center fielder Joe 
Carter converged, no one came up with the ball. It deflected off Templeton's 
glove -- later was ruled a hit -- and Mitchell came across home plate with a 
run while Thompson went to second. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts, however, averted complete catastrophe when he induced Jose Uribe to 
ground out to third baseman Bip Roberts, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants threatened again in the ninth. Brett Butler hit a one-out single to 
right, and after Rick Parker hit into a fielder's choice, Will Clark singled to 
center, putting runners on first and second with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
Next up: Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Gulp. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Mitchell swung at Lefferts' first pitch, popping up to Roberts in 
foul territory. Roberts snagged the ball, and lifted his hands in triumph, 
signifying the finality of the Padres' losing skein. 
</P>
<P>
And wouldn't you know it, for the first time since June 8, the Padres actually 
led a game for all nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
How remarkable was the feat for the Padres? 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: The Padres had led in just six of their previous 88 innings 
entering the night, and had not owned a lead since Friday night when they beat 
the Dodgers, 3-1, in 13 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest beneficiary in the victory was starting pitcher Hurst, who 
had not won a game since May 18. Hurst lasted just five innings, but when he 
got in trouble this time, McKeon didn't hesitate pulling him, allowing his 
bullpen to come to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, though, can't be blamed if he was a bit rattled before he even took the 
mound. He was warming up in the bullpen before the game, and really, couldn't 
believe what he was seeing. 
</P>
<P>
There, before his very eyes, were his teammates actually scoring in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
There was Roberts drawing a one-out walk. There was Roberts stealing second. 
There was Roberts scoring on Roberto Alomar's single to center, and going to 
second on catcher Gary Carter's error. There was Joe Carter, who received 
hitting advice by former Giant Bobby Bonds before the game, singling to left, 
scoring Alomar for the second run. There was Carter going to second on a balk, 
to third on a wild pitch and scoring on Mike Pagliarulo's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago, who's sitting at home with a broken left arm, 
widened his gap over the rest of the field in the All-Star balloting. Santiago 
has received 619,945 votes compared to 208,750 by Mike Scioscia of the Dodgers. 
If Santiago wins the nomination by the fans, he still will be invited to attend 
the festivities by the Major League Baseball office. Yet, unlike last year when 
he received a $25,000 incentive for making the All-Star team, Santiago does not 
have such a clause this season. . . . Padre outfielder Fred Lynn's home run 
Monday night was the first homer hit into the upper deck at Candlestick Park 
this season, and by Lynn's best estimate, might have been the longest of his 
career. "I sure can't think of any I've ever hit any farther, that's for sure," 
Lynn said. . . . Just what is the secret to the Giants' 16-1 streak, which is 
their best since going 17-1 Sept. 4-Sept. 20, 1965? It's simple. Some Giant fan 
sent a vial of dirt from the Iowa farm in which the movie Field of Dreams was 
shot. "At the way we're going," Giant Manager Roger Craig said, "we'll have 
half the farm sent here." . . . Giant General Manager Al Rosen on their streak: 
"We weren't as bad as we looked at the start, but we're not as good as we've 
looked lately, either. Somewhere in between is a pretty good team. How good? I 
don't know. If we get decent pitching, we're the best team in the league. If we 
don't, we're just another team." . . . Craig, on the stock answer given by many 
managers that they don't read the newspapers: "I remember Preston Gomez used to 
tell that to all the writers, and I used to believe it. Then one day I came to 
his hotel room. I saw eight newspapers from eight different cities. He 
subscribed to them all." . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon on the subject of 
retaliation: "I don't even want to know about it. I would never order one of my 
players to do that. Now, if they do it on their own, hey, I'm not going to stop 
them. The only time I've ever ordered someone to get hit was when I was 
managing in the Carolina League. Some guy was stealing second and third with an 
11-run lead. We took care of his running for a while." . . . Craig, on the 
Giants' 91-36 scoring advantage against the Atlanta Braves this season: (Braves 
Manager) Russ Nixon came up to me and said, 'Roger, you know how much I like 
you and everything, but I really don't care to see you again, not even in 
September." . . . There's an advertisement in the local newspapers featuring 
San Francisco 49er running back Roger Craig in underwear. Well, the same ad can 
now be found in Craig's office, the only difference being that the manager's 
face is superimposed over the running back's face." . . . Giant first baseman 
Will Clark on being the Padres' No. 1 enemy: "When you're losing, you don't 
want to step on anyone's toes. But when you're winning, it doesn't matter -- 
you step on them with both feet." . . . The Padres will conclude their 
three-game series in San Francisco with a 12:35 game today against the Giants. 
Andy Benes (6-4) and John Burkett (7-1) are the scheduled pitchers. The Padres 
are off Thursday, and then will play a three-game series in Atlanta.

Carry that reality forward into a situation in which a runner or runners are on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the pressure has to be on the hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That is the opinion of one Joseph Chris Carter, who may be the best the Padres 
have had at clearing runners off the base paths and sending them back to the 
dugout, to high-fives and smiling faces. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure's on the pitchers," he insisted, "not on the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
This is a theory that flies in the face of common sense. It's almost as radical 
as saying the caddy is under more pressure than the golfer at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Carter believes this . . . and that just might be a key to his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
When runners are on base, he is in his element. A pitcher facing Carter with 
men on base is like a guy going into the water after a shark or into the jungle 
after a leopard. In those situations, Carter is as comfortable as Johnny Carson 
with a microphone or William Perry with a fork. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," he said, "pitchers pitch totally different with men on base. For one 
thing, you get a lot more fastballs. For another thing, they're always trying 
to make the perfect pitch. And they make mistakes because they're trying so 
hard not to. You take a situation with runners on first and third, and the 
pitcher doesn't want to concede the one run, so he makes a mistake and gives up 
two or three. There's a lot more pressure on them." 
</P>
<P>
With Joe Carter at bat, maybe the pressure is on the pitcher. During the 
Padres' last home stand, he collected his 50th run batted in earlier in the 
season than anyone in the club's history, in Game 58. Four more over the 
weekend boosted him to 54 in his battle with Matt Williams and Will Clark for 
the National League lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had this good a start," said Carter, who had 121 RBI with Cleveland 
in 1986. "I think that year I had in the mid 60s around the All-Star break." 
</P>
<P>
At the rate Carter has been going, he will drive in 143 runs over the full 
season. The old Padre record, 118 by Dave Winfield in 1979, would rate only 
small type next to a number such as that. No one has driven in so many runs in 
the National League since George Foster had 149 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
And the notion is not exactly far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
"The job's a lot easier when the three guys ahead of you are hitting .300," 
Carter said. "That's any four-hole hitter's dream." 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff man Bip Roberts has been around .300 much of the year, and Roberto 
Alomar and Tony Gwynn are both above .300. They set the table, and Carter 
dines. 
</P>
<P>
However, Carter realizes a batting average in the neighborhood of .240, about 
30 points under his career average, has kept him from getting off to an even 
faster start in terms of driving in runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have a lot more RBIs," he said. "I get paid a lot of money to drive 
in runs, and I feel I should be doing a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's thought that he could or should be doing more goes hand in hand with 
the reality that this team should be doing more. This is unsettling to a man 
who might otherwise be celebrating his early-season success rather than 
worrying about improving. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing," he said, "is that we've gotta win some ballgames. I'm at the 
point in my career where I don't have to put up stats for financial reasons. I 
don't have to put up numbers for a good contract. I've played through that part 
of my career, and I don't have any financial worries now. I have to elevate my 
game, and we have to elevate our game to a different level now and win 
ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter, in essence, wants to do what the Padres acquired him to do, which 
is to lift the offense to a different level. And the Padres paid quite a price 
for him, giving up catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., infielder Carlos Baerga and 
outfielder Chris James to the Cleveland Indians. A few years ago, you could 
have bought Mission Valley for less. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, he has done what he came to do. He has also played a rather elegant 
center field, filling another position of need. With his long legs and speed, 
the man could probably cover Kern County in six strides. Color defense another 
plus. 
</P>
<P>
However, offense is his forte . . . and driving in runs is his specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Just wake him up when there are runners on base. Never mind. Don't bother 
awakening him. Those are the situations in which he is the most relaxed.

"I have never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life." 
</P>
<P>
RAY KROC April 9, 1974 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't an auspicious home debut for Ray Kroc as owner of the Padres, but he 
couldn't contain himself. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Kroc was upset with his new employees would be to understate the 
case. He was so enraged that he grabbed the public-address microphone and told 
the Padres what he thought about the way they were playing. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc unleashed his tirade during the Padres' home opener against the Houston 
Astros at San Diego Stadium on April 9, 1974, just two months after buying the 
club and sparing San Diego the loss of its National League team to Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Kroc's words brought negative feedback that was overwhelming, 
from the players all the way up to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Padre players were so angry that they considered boycotting the 
next game, according to Steve Arlin, the losing pitcher that night and now a 
San Diego dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all embarrassed by it," Arlin said recently. "We weren't playing well, 
but we didn't need to be reminded. We didn't boycott because Kroc apologized, 
and I suppose that let him off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
And some levity came out of the mess, thanks to the promotional talent of the 
Padres' president, Buzzie Bavasi. 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi got an idea from postgame comments made by Astro third baseman Doug 
Rader, who later played and coached for the Padres and now manages the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that Kroc had made his millions by marketing hamburgers 
as board chairman of the McDonald's Corp., Rader said, "He thinks he's in a 
sales convention dealing with a bunch of short-order cooks. That's not the way 
to go about getting a winner. Somebody ought to sit him down and straighten him 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi picked up on this by designating the first night of the Astros' next 
visit as Short-Order Cooks' Night. Any fan wearing a chef's hat would be 
admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, the Astros' captain, took the lineup card to home plate wearing a chef's 
hat and an apron and carrying a skillet and spatula. He presented the lineup 
card to the home plate umpire by slipping it off the skillet like a pancake. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 300 fans took advantage of the free offer, and attendance was a 
disappointing 10,776, but it wasn't long before the Padres finally caught on. 
Despite making it six for six in last-place finishes, they drew 1,075,399 in 
1974 after never drawing more than 644,272. 
</P>
<P>
"We had brought in several name players," said Bavasi, now retired and living 
in La Jolla. "Players like Willie McCovey and Glenn Beckert and Bobby Tolan 
gave the team credibility that we never had before." 
</P>
<P>
There also are those who feel that Kroc's seemingly ill-advised remarks had 
something to do with the sudden increase in Padre attendance. Former Padre 
announcer Dave Campbell, who played for the Astros then, subscribes to that 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
Said Campbell, now with ESPN: "The long-term interpretation of what Kroc said 
was that the people of San Diego realized they finally had an owner who cared." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, considering what was to follow, Kroc seemed reasonably tolerant of 
the Padres' ineptitude between a three-game wipeout at Dodger Stadium that 
opened the season and the home opener. 
</P>
<P>
After the third loss to the Dodgers, Kroc said, "They're snake-bit, and they've 
got the yips. They're overanxious, trying too hard, too tense. We'll get it 
straightened out. There are 159 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Fans are basically pessimistic. A lot of people are still talking about the 
next Depression. But you watch. We'll fool them." 
</P>
<P>
Then, the night before the home opener, Kroc spoke in equally positive terms at 
the preseason baseball dinner at the Town &amp; Country Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
After making it clear that there would be changes if the Padres didn't improve, 
Kroc said, "It was a lost weekend (in Los Angeles). The season opens tomorrow 
night. These are professionals, and they're going to win for us." 
</P>
<P>
But not opening night. Kroc's first home game as owner was played before a 
crowd of 39,083, the Padres' second largest since their founding in 1969. Maybe 
that helped push his patience to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Matty Alou lost track of the outs and was doubled off first 
base on a foul to the catcher with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
The game was in the middle of the eighth, and the Padres were well on their way 
to running their record to 0-4. Houston was ahead, 9-2, thus continuing a trend 
set by the Padres in beatings of 8-0, 8-0 and 9-2 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the Astros had been retired in the top of the eighth, Kroc went into 
the public-address booth and told announcer John De Mott that he had something 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
Something indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc began innocently enough, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, I suffer with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, a streaker leaped over the railing of the stands in left and 
raced across the field. 
</P>
<P>
A roar went up from the crowd. When Kroc spotted the uninvited guest, he 
yelled, "Get him out of here. Throw him in jail." 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of seconds, the streaker had disappeared into the tunnel, police 
and security guards in hot pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
After the fans settled down, Kroc continued: "There is good news and bad news. 
First, the good news. You loyal fans outdid Los Angeles. They had 31,000 for 
opening night and we have nearly 40,000. God bless you. Now for the bad news. I 
have never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life." 
</P>
<P>
That was it . . . short and not at all sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres promptly roused themselves sufficiently to score three runs, losing 
by only 9-5, the closest of the season to that point. They then lost two more 
games, both 9-1, before finally winning en route to a 60-102 record. 
</P>
<P>
But the big story was the reaction to Kroc's remarks, and to his credit, he 
lost no time in expressing his regrets. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he said, "I phoned home, and my wife gave me hell. I never should 
have gone on. We were playing bad ball. We weren't giving the fans the kind of 
show we wanted to give them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my statement was misconstrued. What I meant was, well, sometimes you 
have a partner in golf who goofs one. You give him the needle. It was an 
impulsive thing." 
</P>
<P>
Kroc then made his apology to the players through McCovey, the Padre player 
representative, but the damage had been done. His oratory had sent shock waves 
to everybody in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
There were words of censure from Kuhn, a complaint from Marvin Miller, head of 
the players' union, and a directive from Chub Feeney, president of the National 
League, that only the public-address announcer was authorized to speak into a 
stadium microphone. 
</P>
<P>
(This was the same Chub Feeney whose post-retirement career as president of the 
Padres ended shortly after he made an obscene gesture to hecklers on Fan 
Appreciation Night in 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
When Miller heard about Kroc's blast, he said, "The managers of the San Diego 
and Houston clubs have demonstrated by their restraint in the face of Mr. 
Kroc's inexcusable insults that their intelligence far exceeds his." 
</P>
<P>
McCovey, acting as spokesman for the Padre players, said, "I've played baseball 
for 19 years, and I've never been called stupid before in the middle of a game 
over the PA system by the owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing but respect for the man, but we're professionals, and we 
deserve better than that. I don't think this has ever been done in the history 
of baseball. Until somebody comes down from the front office and talks with the 
team, this thing is going to be a cloud hanging over every player out there." 
</P>
<P>
Some Astros said they were just as upset as the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manager Preston Gomez, who was the Padres' first manager and now is 
assistant to Mike Port, general manager of the Angels: "I've managed in Latin 
America under owners that were nuts, but I've never seen anything like this 
happen before. You should never try to embarrass people publicly." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Denis Menke, the Astros' player representative, now a coach for the 
Philadelphia Phillies: "He ruined a big night in this city, for our team as 
well as his. He made this a bad week for baseball. He isn't dealing with 
hamburger people; he's dealing with professional athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher Claude Osteen, now a minor league pitching coach for the Dodgers: 
"I couldn't believe it. It's a shame, because he's the one who rescued baseball 
for San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Infielder Tommy Helms, now a minor league manager for the Chicago Cubs: 
"You can't kick a horse when he's down. What's he going to say if they go out 
and win 10 straight?" 
</P>
<P>
Other Padre players let McCovey do their talking for them, both before and 
after Kroc's apology, which was made to McCovey by telephone. Afterward, 
McCovey said, "The players are satisfied, and the matter is closed. We want to 
get down to the business of winning ballgames for Mr. Kroc and the fans of San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Today, 16 years later, most of those who were touched in some way by Kroc's 
address look back on it light-heartedly. 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi recalled that he was faced with another problem at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray and I were sitting together when I got a phone call," Bavasi said. "There 
was a leak in the clubhouse from a concession stand, and soon there was a real 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
"As I got on the elevator, I heard Ray say something about the big crowd, and I 
thought, 'That's nice of Ray, thanking the fans for turning out.' I didn't hear 
any more, so when I got back, I was stunned. I talked to him immediately, and 
he regretted saying it, but there was nothing he could do. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, they had me on the (radio) wrap-up show. All I said was, 'Ray 
is an impulsive man who says what he thinks, and if he embarrassed anybody, 
he's sorry.' 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I think we made some fans that night. Ray said what the fans would 
like to have said. And as far as the players were concerned, the real pros knew 
what he was trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Jones, the 1976 Cy Young Award winner who lives in Poway, said he enjoyed 
Kroc's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I really laughed," Jones said. "I thought it was pretty funny. I thought he 
was right on. It was consistent with the way we were going. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray was a great guy and a great man. If it hadn't been for him, we would have 
been in Washington. Everything at the ballpark was packed up until he bought 
the club." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Gary Ross, now owner of a liquor store in Encinitas, was somewhat less 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny, but we were kind of shocked," Ross said. "At first, everybody 
got ticked off. I was in the bullpen, and when we heard it, we ducked into the 
cubbyhole out there and stayed out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Coleman, then as now the Padres' lead broadcaster, recalled how Kroc's 
speech was handled on radio: 
</P>
<P>
"When it was announced that Ray had something to say, I told Tommy Jorgensen, 
who is still our producer and engineer, to pick it up on our field mike. When 
Ray got through, my only quote was, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that was Padre owner 
Ray Kroc.' I didn't comment on it. I didn't know what to say." 
</P>
<P>
Bavasi resigned the Padre presidency after the 1977 season ended to become 
executive vice president of the Angels. When he left San Diego, though, he 
carried with him warm memories of his association with Kroc, who died in 
January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray was one of the best owners I ever met," Bavasi said. "The fact that I 
spent nine seasons with him made my 46 years in baseball worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he had acquired great respect for Kroc during his two tours of duty 
with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"What he did that night was not necessarily done the right way," Rader said. 
"Nevertheless, he was trying to help his team, that's all. I never really got 
to know him, but when my name was brought up as a prospective coach, he said, 
'That guy's got guts.' That meant a lot to me, and San Diego will always have a 
special place in my heart. 
</P>
<P>
"When Buzzie called me and told me they were putting on that cooks' night, I 
thought it was a terrific promotion. The whole situation turned out to be a fun 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Ray A. Kroc, founder of McDonald's Corp., saved baseball for San Diego in 1974 
when he purchased the Padres shortly before a scheduled move to Washington, 
D.C. The Padres won their only National League championship after his death on 
Jan. 14, 1984. Kroc family ownership of the club continued under Ray's wife, 
Joan, until last week, when it was sold to a group headed by television 
producer Tom Werner.

MEMO ACCUSES BUSH'S SON OF S&amp;L DISHONESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators charged that President Bush's son Neil engaged in "personal 
dishonesty" as a director of the failed Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. and sought to bar him from future service as a thrift director, according 
to a confidential memorandum disclosed Tuesday at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, prepared early this year by the enforcement staff of the federal 
Office of Thrift Supervision, was never formally issued as a complaint against 
Bush, and the agency eventually moved against him on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations contained in the OTS memorandum provide the most detailed 
account made public about the role of the President's son in the financial 
demise of Silverado, one of the biggest failures among hundreds of S&amp;L 
insolvencies. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush was not present at Tuesday's hearing, but in previous appearances he 
has strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with his tenure as a Silverado 
director. He is challenging in an administrative proceeding the government's 
allegations that he violated thrift rules. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "willfully breached" his duty as a director by failing to inform the board 
that a major borrower at the S&amp;L, Kenneth M. Good, was going to pay $3 
million for an 80% interest in Bush's oil exploration company, the OTS document 
says. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time Good was buying control of Bush's firm, the Silverado board 
agreed to forgive $11 million in loans and obligations owed by Good to the 
S&amp;L because he allegedly could not pay his bills, the memorandum states. 
</P>
<P>
Bush abstained from voting on Silverado's loans to Good, but the OTS document 
said he did not disclose his business relations with Good as required by 
federal regulations affecting thrift directors. 
</P>
<P>
Good and another investor in Bush's firm, William L. Walters, ultimately 
defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at Denver-based Silverado. The 
cleanup of the institution, which was seized by federal regulators last 
December, could cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Good, appearing in response to a subpoena by the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee, defended the President's son. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time did I ask or expect Neil to influence or vote on any of the 
transactions that were negotiated with Silverado management," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Good said he was "shocked by the personal attacks that continue to be made upon 
(Bush) with regard to his role in Silverado. I can testify without hesitation 
that Neil is a man of absolute integrity . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), who obtained the OTS document, said the office 
and its predecessor, "under Republican control for nearly the past 10 years, is 
clearly not an agency designed to make political hay by going after the son of 
the President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Serious charges have been leveled against Neil Bush," Annunzio said. "Is that 
the end of the case? That the taxpayers are going to have to pick up a 
$1-billion tab without ever knowing whether Neil Bush was right or wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Good and other key figures in Silverado's downfall testified in the third day 
of Banking Committee hearings on the S&amp;L, where Neil Bush served as a 
director from August, 1985, until August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have tried to link the President's son to greedy real estate 
developers who defaulted on loans from the thrift, and Republicans have 
defended him as an honest, if occasionally naive, young man. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush left the Silverado board in August, "the Colorado savings and loan 
commissioner had all but sounded the death warning when he told Silverado that 
it would have to raise $62 million of new capital or face a closure order," 
committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said. 
</P>
<P>
When the state official moved to enforce his order and attempted to shut 
Silverado in October, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in 
Washington quickly ordered a two-month delay, putting off any action until 
after the presidential election. Kermit Mowbray, serving as the chief regulator 
for the region, told the committee that he received a phone call from his 
superiors in Washington directing a postponement in closing Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 9, the day after President Bush won the election, Mowbray submitted a 
formal recommendation that Silverado be placed into receivership, and the 
government took control on Dec. 9. In response to questions, Mowbray said he 
did not think the postponement was based on political considerations. He said 
he had never been subjected to any political pressure or influence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In the memo, the federal regulators' criticism of Neil Bush focused on his 
failure to disclose his business ties with Walters and Good, major borrowers at 
Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Walters invested $150,000 in JNB, Bush's oil exploration firm, providing half 
of its original capital. Bush later voted to approve loans to Walters and his 
companies, although he abstained from voting on loans to Good. 
</P>
<P>
The enforcement staff's document, prepared in January, named Bush, along with 
former Silverado Chairman Michael Wise, Director James Metz, Executive Vice 
President Russell Murray, and outside counsel Ronald Jacobs. It said their 
conduct "involved personal dishonesty, or demonstrated a willful or continuing 
disregard for the safety or soundness of Silverado." 
</P>
<P>
The document called for a hearing to decide on issuance of an order barring the 
four men from ever working again for federally insured institutions without 
prior government approval. The proposed prohibition was never issued by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez noted that Wise and Metz, and two other former Silverado executives, 
chief operating officer Richard K. Vandapool and chief financial officer Robert 
M. Lewis, signed consent orders accepting the prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS filed a lesser complaint against Neil Bush, seeking a cease-and-desist 
order that would direct him to refrain from committing any future violations of 
disclosure rules. An administrative law judge at the agency will conduct a 
hearing later this year to determine whether to proceed against Bush.

There was not sufficient evidence against Bush to seek a prohibition order, 
according to OTS officials.

The pending case against Bush "has thrown a bright spotlight on the obligation 
of boards of directors to meet their fiduciary responsibility," Gonzalez said. 
"This responsibility is critical to the safety and soundness of any 
institution, and it is the first line of defense against raids on the insurance 
funds and the taxpayers."

THRIFTIER CONSUMERS SPUR FEARS OF RECESSION IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of spirited spending, U.S. consumers are showing new restraint in 
their purchases this year, a trend that could nudge the economy toward a 
recession if it persists, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"If consumer spending continues as it has in the last three months, we could be 
headed for a recession in the next three months," warned Bruce Steinberg, a 
senior economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Economists are far from ready to declare America's 90-month economic expansion 
to be over, but increasingly they are asking: Is the free-spending, 
luxury-loving consumer of the 1980s pooping out in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
The question is important because spending on autos, furniture, appliances, 
clothing, entertainment and other consumer products and services accounts for 
two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Confident consumers are willing to part with 
cash; their spending has propelled the longest peacetime economic expansion in 
the United States since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Worried consumers, by contrast, hold their dollars with great care, depriving 
the economy of a basic source of growth. And recent signs suggest that worries 
are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
In May, for instance, retail sales dropped 0.7%. It was the third consecutive 
monthly decline -- and the longest downward streak in nine years, the Commerce 
Department reported. The government's broadest gauge of consumer spending, 
which also includes dollars spent on services, also has been falling in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough," said Bill Dombrowski, vice president of corporate affairs at 
Carter Hawley Hale Stores, a Los Angeles-based retailing company that owns the 
Broadway department stores. "It was a tough quarter for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The firm, along with other major retailers, has had disappointing sales in 
furniture and other "big-ticket" items, Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are being a little more cautious," said Rosalind Wells, chief 
economist with the National Retail Federation in New York. But she added 
quickly: "I don't think things are falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of explanations for the consumer malaise. Sluggish 
employment growth is often cited. So is the real estate slowdown in the 
Northeast and California. Some economists take the long-term view, pointing to 
the aging of the baby boom generation and, with it, a growing emphasis on 
saving instead of material indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Even the weather, which was unseasonably cold and wet in much of the country 
last month, gets its share of the blame. "The normal summer goods didn't really 
sell in a big quantity," said Thomas E. Swanstrom, chief economist with Sears 
Merchandise Group in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorology alone, however, does not explain the chillier consumer. Employment 
growth, for instance, has been weak to nonexistent in certain key sectors of 
late. In May, for instance, factory jobs fell for the seventh time in nine 
months. Such declines not only injure those affected directly but also spread 
ripple effects of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"You get eight to 10 people scared for every one laid off," said Donald 
Ratajczak, an economic forecaster at Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the fears may be spreading. A year ago, 34% of Americans polled by 
the Conference Board described jobs as "plentiful," with 21% responding that 
jobs were hard to get. By contrast, in a similar survey last month by the New 
York research organization, just 27% said jobs were plentiful and 23% said jobs 
were hard to get. 
</P>
<P>
The comfortably employed have other concerns. Many have watched with dismay as 
a chill in housing markets has spread from the Northeast to California and some 
other regions. New York median housing prices, for instance, are running 5% 
lower than a year ago, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
In California, median home prices overall are down 2% from a year ago, although 
they are up about 2% in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the 
California Assn. of Realtors. Still, the modest gains are a jolting turnabout 
from the heady real estate appreciation of the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the No. 1 thing that's causing middle-class households concern is the 
slowdown in housing prices," said Robert H. Dugger, chief economist at the 
American Bankers Assn. in Washington. "So many of them viewed their home equity 
as an important indicator of their household wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Other indicators suggest that consumers are changing for reasons more basic 
than housing prices. In the go-go 1980s, wealth -- or the illusion of it -- was 
fueled by a rapid rise in borrowing. This year, household borrowing is going up 
more slowly than in the past, and many consumers appear to be paying back their 
debts, Dugger said. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts contend that this phenomenon might partly reflect the aging of the 
population, especially the baby boom, which is pushing into its 40s. Consumers 
typically save more as they settle into middle age and start to plan for such 
long-term expenses as retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got their houses. They've got their cars. They've got their furniture. 
They're pretty well set," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at 
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. "As they get older, they realize 
they're not immortal and start putting money aside for their children's 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer saving rates -- computed as a percentage of disposable income -- have 
edged up to 5.6% in the first quarter of this year from 3.2% in 1987, according 
to the Commerce Department. The view that a long-term spending shift has 
started to affect the economic statistics is in dispute, however. For one 
thing, the 1990 savings rate figures may be reduced next month because of lower 
official estimates of income growth, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
"Savings is maybe edging up a little bit -- from a very, very low level," said 
Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation also has created uncertainty about consumer attitudes. Earlier this 
year, it soared to an 8% annual rate, pushed by cold-weather-related increases 
in the prices of heating oil and food. Although it eased to less than 3% in 
April and May, some say government officials are underestimating the price 
pressures that consumers now face. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, for example, does not sufficiently weigh such 
expenses as insurance, state and local taxes and utility bills, many of which 
have been moving up, Albert E. Sindlinger, an economist who runs a consumer 
research firm in Wallingford, Pa., contends. 
</P>
<P>
Using his own formulas, Sindlinger calculates that income gains -- averaging in 
the 4.5% range -- have lagged behind inflation -- at more than 7% -- for 
several months, causing a crunch that is damaging the U.S. economy in many 
regions. "Eight of 10 people now are telling us their income is down because 
their fixed costs are up," Sindlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rising concerns about the consumer, the economy retains strength in 
exports and manufacturing. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence 
has dropped from a level of 116.7 last May to 107.3 this May, but it remains 
substantially above levels associated with a recession. 
</P>
<P>
New signs of weakness may prompt the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest 
rates, which could spark a rebound in the housing industry. And economists 
point approvingly to lean inventory levels in the auto and other industries, a 
situation that reduces the possibility of harmful industrial bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unusual and very scary," Wahed said of the three-month series of 
retail sales declines. "But I still lay odds of 4 to 1 that this will not cause 
a recession in the near future."

HOMELESS DILEMMA TESTS SANTA MONICA'S TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Finnen -- 89 years old and hard of hearing, but as feisty as they come 
-- had stopped her shopping cart in the bakery section at Vons near her Santa 
Monica home last March when a young, "not too clean" man approached and asked, 
innocuously enough, "Where's the mayonnaise?" 
</P>
<P>
As Finnen raised her arm to point, Finnen testified in court last week, the man 
shoved a pair of scissors into her side, grabbed her purse and ran. Minutes 
later, police arrested James Earl Tillman, a 31-year-old homeless man, in a 
nearby alley. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted murder case, now being deliberated by a Superior Court jury, has 
made Frances Finnen a symbol for Santa Monica's latest political struggle -- a 
debate over whether to run its highly visible transient population out of town. 
For Santa Monica, a city that prides itself on tolerance, compassion and rent 
control, the homeless issue presents an especially awkward civic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The street people, many Santa Monicans insist, have worn out their welcome. 
Nonetheless, Santa Monica's traditional leniency toward the downtrodden remains 
in evidence each afternoon on the City Hall lawn, where as many as 300 
transients line up to receive a free meal from a charity group. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes like these anger some citizens. "They finish eating her sandwiches," one 
woman said, referring to a volunteer in the meal program, "then they come and 
defecate on my lawn." 
</P>
<P>
They have focused their ire on Santa Monica's liberal city attorney, Robert 
Myers, who they say has all but invited the homeless to the city and who they 
want to unseat. Defenders of Myers contend he is but a convenient scapegoat for 
a perplexing social problem, and they question the political motives of the 
conservative leaders of the movement against him. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane, a leader of the council's liberal majority that 
supports Myers, describes the community as deeply conflicted, seeking a balance 
between tough law enforcement and aid for those in need. A Chamber of Commerce 
poll found that although Santa Monicans want tough law enforcement against 
transient lawbreakers, they also favor improved social services for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Myers is being (blamed) for the policies of Ronald Reagan and George 
Deukmejian, ironically by people who supported Ronald Reagan and George 
Deukmejian," Zane said, a reference to cuts in national and state mental health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
While precise numbers are not available, hundreds of homeless men and women are 
believed by officials to make their beds each night in Santa Monica. With its 
temperate climate, sandy beaches and easygoing lifestyle, the city has long 
attracted a disproportionately large number of street people. Social workers 
believe it is perhaps the county's largest concentration outside of Skid Row in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase in homeless nationwide during the 1980s, including 
thousands of deinstitutionalized mentally ill, was magnified in Santa Monica, 
as more and more transients found their way to the western terminus of old 
Route 66. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica -- so liberal that conservative wags sometimes call it "Soviet" 
Monica -- reacted by increasing social programs and providing more food, 
clothing and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Myers, rather than prosecuting the homeless for such nonviolent 
misdemeanors as panhandling and sleeping in the park, instituted a program of 
referring minor offenders to service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, amid a rising rate of crimes blamed on transients, many Santa Monicans 
suggest the city was too hospitable. The attack on Frances Finnen "woke us up 
to how bad the situation really is," said activist Leslie Dutton. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of conservative causes, Dutton is leading an initiative that calls 
for the city attorney position to be elected rather than appointed. About 7,900 
signatures are needed to qualify for the November ballot; so far, Dutton said, 
the group has collected almost 9,000 and plans to hand over its petitions to 
the city clerk Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica backlash seems to mirror a national anti-homeless trend: Los 
Angeles sporadically conducts police "sweeps" on cardboard communities on Skid 
Row; New York has attempted to enact an anti-begging statute for subways, and 
Costa Mesa in Orange County has forced a social agency to relocate from a 
middle-class neighborhood to an industrial zone. 
</P>
<P>
While there is contentious debate over who to blame, most Santa Monicans seem 
to agree that the homeless have created serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce poll found that the homeless are a 
chief concern of city residents, comparable with the polluted bay and far ahead 
of traffic and development. Palisades Park and Lincoln Park, once favorite 
family picnic spots, are now so dominated by transients that many residents 
stay away. Grocery stores have hired security guards to discourage theft and 
panhandling. The Police Department, in addition to regular patrols, recently 
instituted a two-officer task force that exclusively patrols homeless haunts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Santa Monica police statistics, 30% of the department's time and 
money is devoted to calls regarding transients. Since 1986, increases -- 
sometimes dramatic -- have been recorded in the number of arrests of transients 
suspected of homicide, rape, assault, robbery and burglary. Victims of crimes 
committed by transients are most often transients themselves, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There are notorious exceptions. The February, 1989, slaying of social worker 
Robbyn Panitch, allegedly stabbed to death by a transient in a county mental 
health clinic, provided a stark example of how people who try to help can 
become victims. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, along with a deputy city attorney, was slightly injured when attacked a 
few weeks ago by a man who appeared to be mentally ill. The attacker fled and 
it has not been determined whether the attacker was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the city attorney is being held up by opponents as the embodiment 
of soft-hearted liberalism that makes grocery-store stabbings possible. 
Activists claim Myers' refusal to prosecute nonviolent misdemeanors such as 
panhandling and sleeping in public parks have led to more serious lawlessness 
and exacerbated public fears. 
</P>
<P>
Myers has long been a controversial figure in Santa Monica, known for his 
authorship of the city's landmark rent-control law and his willingness to be 
arrested protesting nuclear arms testing. He declined interview requests and 
issued a statement accusing Dutton of a campaign that "has degenerated into a 
series of lies and distortions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
His statement went on: "The criminal justice system simply doesn't have the 
ability to deal with the homeless problem. Moreover, there would be no justice 
in the system if it could be used to herd people off to jail merely because 
they had no home." 
</P>
<P>
Myers emphasized that most people arrested by Santa Monica police, whether 
homeless or not, are prosecuted by the county district attorney's office, not 
by the city attorney's office. Moreover, Myers maintained that his office 
prosecutes many misdemeanor offenses committed by homeless persons, including 
cases of overly aggressive panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
James Tillman, facing a potential life sentence for attempted murder of Finnen 
and other felonies, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
One month before that incident, Tillman was arrested by Santa Monica police for 
theft involving the use of force. The county district attorney's office 
declined to prosecute the case as a felony, so Myers' office pressed 
misdemeanor charges. Tillman pleaded guilty, was placed on probation and fined 
$100 -- a fee waived by the court because of the three days Tillman spent in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton overlooks this when she proclaims: "Why was Mr. Tillman in Santa Monica? 
The answer is Mr. Myers and his policy not to prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
Dutton, a leader of the arch-conservative Assn. of American Women, is no less 
controversial than Myers as an advocate of far-right views on pornography and 
AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed, a member of the council's conservative minority, 
said she seldom agrees with Dutton, whom she described as "a political loose 
cannon." But Reed believes that Myers has been too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the homeless problem is made worse by "young vagrants who are 
committed to a life of chemical dependency, either drugs or alcohol. . . . 
They've found a place where they can sleep in the park and not get harassed too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
But many people -- including officials in the Santa Monica Police Department, 
the Chamber of Commerce and social service agencies -- said it's absurd to 
blame Myers. The criminal justice system, they said, is simply too overwhelmed 
to handle minor offenses of the homeless, and even the toughest, meanest 
prosecutor wouldn't have more success than Myers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fault him for his prosecution policies," said Sgt. John Miehle, 
adjutant to Police Chief James Keane, "seeing how the sheriff doesn't have any 
room in the jail to put people." 
</P>
<P>
According to public records filed in connection with the Finnen case, a doctor 
who examined Tillman after his arrest judged him to be borderline retarded and 
probably suffering from an organic mental disorder, possibly the result of a 
childhood brain infection. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman had been in Santa Monica a few months, usually sleeping in an alley 
carport, his public defender said. In court testimony, Tillman said he visited 
Vons to steal food. He portrayed the stabbing of Finnen as an accident, saying 
she quickly turned into the scissors as he tried to steal her purse. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began deliberations Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A block from the courthouse last week, as the trial was winding down, the usual 
queue had convened at 4 p.m. on the City Hall lawn for the daily handout. 
</P>
<P>
Several said they had come to Santa Monica to escape the meaner streets of 
L.A.'s Skid Row. Said 40-year-old Bill Butler, a newcomer: "There's something 
about the beach. If you're going to choose to sleep behind a bush, it seems 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
Transients said they were grateful for the free food. "It's not like a soup 
line," one said. A few did complain that the food was a day old.

CANADIAN PACT FALLING APART AS PUBLIC BALKS

ST JOHNS, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than two weeks ago, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney could argue that he had 
it all sewn up: The political elite of the country had signed a constitutional 
deal that would avert the threatened breakup of English- and French-speaking 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
No more. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable political upset, public opinion has swept Mulroney's arduously 
crafted plans into complete disarray. The constitutional deal that looked like 
a juggernaut just one week ago now looks as though it will die Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the seemingly mortal blows have been dealt by obscure figures in 
Manitoba and Newfoundland, have-not provinces that don't often make it into the 
national news headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have been predicting that if Mulroney's constitutional accord fails, 
Quebec will take steps toward restructuring its relationship with 
English-speaking Canada, perhaps even toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
There are also predictions that the damage to Mulroney will be profound. Even 
before this week, his standing in the polls was painfully low, and the events 
of the last few days have shown just how determined he can be to ram his ideas 
through, regardless of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"The trust of Canadians in their leaders has been ruptured," said Christopher 
Dunn, a political scientist at Memorial University here in St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a member of Mulroney's Progressive Conservative caucus quit last week 
over the prime minister's constitutional management, bringing to six the number 
of Tories who have either left or been kicked out of the party in recent 
months. Although Mulroney's constitutional package may yet be saved -- the past 
few weeks have already brought a number of big political surprises -- more 
Tories may jump ship, depending on what happens over the next few days and 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"If Meech doesn't pass, he's shagged," fisherman Don Stanford said of Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
"Meech" is shorthand for the now-notorious Meech Lake Accord, a package of 
constitutional amendments that were written in 1987 to give greater powers to 
Canada's 10 provinces, and in particular to the French-speaking province of 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The accord started out as an innocuous effort to persuade Quebec to sign the 
national constitution, which it hasn't done so far. But over the three years 
since the accord was drafted, it has evolved into a political Frankenstein, 
frightening some Canadians into thinking that the country will fall apart if it 
is ratified, and others into believing the country will fall apart if it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mulroney launched an all-out effort to silence the opposition to 
the accord and to persuade all 10 provincial premiers to ratify the amendments. 
If the amendments aren't unanimously ratified by Saturday, the accord will 
become null. Mulroney called the 10 premiers to Ottawa, the national capital, 
and essentially closeted them in a conference center until they agreed to sign. 
Even then, Manitoba and Newfoundland held out as long as they could. 
</P>
<P>
The secrecy of the meetings annoyed many Canadians, but when the talks were 
over, Mulroney declared victory. He and the 10 exhausted premiers held an 
emotional accord-signing ceremony in Ottawa, making speeches about national 
unity in an auditorium draped with colorful provincial flags. 
</P>
<P>
It was a triumphant moment, but only a moment. As soon as the premiers of 
Newfoundland and Manitoba went back to their respective capitals -- St. John's 
and Winnipeg -- saying they would put the accord to a vote in their 
legislatures, new trouble erupted. 
</P>
<P>
In Winnipeg, the trouble took the unexpected form of Elijah Harper, a quiet 
Indian chief and the only native Canadian member of the Manitoba legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Harper was virtually unknown outside of his own impoverished 
district. He cuts a humble figure, his long black hair clipped in an austere 
ponytail, his shoulders slumped, a beaded lanyard hanging at his neck. When he 
makes television appearances, he seems unable to look straight into the camera 
and instead gazes bashfully at the floor. In the legislature, he clutches an 
eagle feather for moral support. 
</P>
<P>
But when his fellow legislators tried to introduce the Meech Lake Accord for 
debate and ratification, Harper launched a one-man procedural battle that has 
held up all discussion for nearly a week. Thanks to his effort, it now looks 
certain that Manitoba will miss the ratification deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Harper's motivation comes from the general feeling among native Canadians that 
the Meech Lake Accord assumes that French and Englishmen, not natives, are the 
nation's founding fathers. Native Canadians are convinced, with some 
justification, that the drafters simply forgot all about aboriginal people when 
they wrote the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Harper is a Cree, but he has won the support of numerous other tribes in 
Canada. When he appears in the legislature, Indians congregate outside, beating 
thunderously on ceremonial drums. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has tried to condemn Harper as a lone meddler holding up 
a vital process for the nation. But it is a hard argument to swallow. In 
addition to the accolades of fellow Indians, Harper has won widespread support 
and admiration from white, English-speaking Canadians who have long opposed the 
accord for their own reasons but couldn't figure out what to do about it. When 
Harper walks in or out of the legislature, he receives applause, cheers and 
slaps on the back from white strangers. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden burst of sympathy from people who never showed much concern for the 
Indian point of view in the past has surprised and touched Harper, who 
sometimes has tears in his eyes when he quietly makes his simple public 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government earlier this week rushed an envoy to the prairie 
province to meet with an assembly of native chiefs and offer them various 
goodies if they would back down. The Indians listened, then said no. 
</P>
<P>
In Newfoundland, on the other hand, Manitoba's Indian uprising has delighted 
legislators who themselves face a vote Friday on whether to ratify the accord. 
Many legislators here have wanted to vote against the accord but are afraid of 
going down in history as the ones who single-handedly drove Quebec out of the 
confederation. Harper's activities have taken some of the pressure off them. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even think that if it is a sympathetic Indian chief who blocks 
the accord, rather than a body of English-speaking politicians, Quebec won't be 
able to react as harshly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't say they won't be furious, but they won't be as furious," said Dunn of 
Memorial University. 
</P>
<P>
While events play out in Manitoba, the 52 members of Newfoundland's House of 
Assembly have been frantically canvassing their constituents, asking them 
whether they should vote yes or no for the accord. Here in Newfoundland, as in 
Manitoba, the answer is generally no. 
</P>
<P>
In Newfoundland, the central objection isn't native rights but the feeling that 
special constitutional powers given to Quebec would elevate French Canadians 
unfairly above the rest of the nation. Quebecers argue that they need such 
special powers because as French speakers they represent a threatened minority 
group. But Newfoundlanders aren't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we are condemning South Africa for -- trying to protect the Boer 
society," said Angela Sullivan, who came to an open house thrown by her member 
of the legislature in a school gym. She pointed out that Canada imposes 
economic sanctions on South Africa while trying to elevate a minority group 
above all others. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have it both ways," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Newfoundlanders have been convinced by past experience that Quebec is a dirty 
dealer that doesn't need any more power than it already has. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 1960s, when Newfoundland wanted to harness the hydroelectric power 
of a mighty waterfall on its Churchill River, Quebec refused to let the 
Atlantic coast province build transmission lines over its territory. Without 
the transmission lines, Newfoundland couldn't deliver the power to markets in 
southern Ontario and the United States. So Newfoundland negotiated to sell its 
power to Quebec over 65 years at a fixed price; Quebec could then resell it 
farther south. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the document was signed, energy prices soared and Newfoundlanders 
found themselves locked into a deal that gave Quebecers the power at a tiny 
fraction of its market price. Today, Newfoundland's hydro-power pours hundreds 
of millions of dollars a year into Quebec's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Newfoundlanders haven't forgotten this and are urging members of their 
legislature not to forget it either when they vote this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like if the French don't get their own way, they just bitch," fisherman 
Bob Morris told his representative, Shannie Duff, when she came to visit him 
and his fellow crewmen in a shack above their small wharf Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Newfoundlanders never get nothing," agreed his friend, Don Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Let Meech die," said Morris. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The Meech Lake Accord, a package of constitutional amendments giving greater 
powers to Canada's provinces and in particular to French-speaking Quebec, must 
be ratified by all 10 provinces by Saturday or it becomes null. In 
Newfoundland, where sentiment is strong against the accord in general and 
Quebec in particular, the legislature is scheduled to vote Friday. In Manitoba, 
an "Indian uprising" seems certain to delay a ratification vote beyond the 
deadline.

TRAIN WRECK IS BLAMED ON MANAGEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DERAILMENT: THE U.S. SAFETY BOARD FAULTS SOUTHERN PACIFIC OFFICIALS FOR THE 
ACCIDENT THAT KILLED FOUR PEOPLE IN SAN BERNARDINO. A BLAST 13 DAYS LATER THAT 
KILLED TWO OTHERS WAS BLAMED ON OFFICIALS OF PIPELINE COMPANY.

<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday blamed Southern Pacific 
Transportation Co. for a "series of management errors" that resulted in four 
deaths when a runaway freight train derailed in a West San Bernardino 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The safety board also found that a pipeline explosion 13 days after the May, 
1989, train wreck occurred because officials of Calnev Pipe Line Co. failed to 
uncover pipeline damage caused by earthmoving equipment used to clear away the 
train wreck. The two accidents killed six people, injured dozens of others and 
destroyed or damaged 29 homes in the working-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a human performance accident, it's a management accident," Jim 
Burnett, an NTSB board member, charged during a brief board debate over the 
culpability and precise cause of the back-to-back disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Before the board reached unanimous agreement on the probable cause of the train 
accident, Chairman Jim Kolstadt and Vice Chairman Susan M. Coughlin attempted 
to persuade their two other colleagues, John K. Lauber and Burnett, to place a 
dose of responsibility for the accident on the train's engineers and conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't leave the crew out," Kolstadt said, his voice rising. "There were so 
many deficiencies in the operation (of the train) by this crew." 
</P>
<P>
Added Coughlin: "I'm uncomfortable leaving the crew out of the picture." 
</P>
<P>
Both Kolstadt and Coughlin based their arguments on evidence cited by William 
Pugh, the chief investigator and head of the NTSB's railroad division, who told 
the board that the train's crew could have stopped the train before proceeding 
down the 23-mile grade leading to the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pugh said, head engineer Frank Holland, who suffered multiple injuries 
in the crash, was following company procedures and had not been trained in 
special emergency braking methods. In addition, the train's crew was unaware 
that only three of its six locomotives had functioning brakes. 
</P>
<P>
And, compounding the string of mishaps leading to disaster, a Southern Pacific 
billing clerk failed to indicate the accurate tonnage of the cargo on the 
shipper's bill of lading. Instead of noting the correct weight of 9,000 tons, 
the clerk estimated that the train's 69 hopper cars full of trona -- a 
sand-like, sodium bicarbonate material -- weighed 6,150 tons. 
</P>
<P>
The train's conductor, Everett Crown, and brakeman Alan R. Reiss were killed in 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, the safety board has focused its investigation on the 
weight of the train, which exceeded speeds of 105 m.p.h. before it rushed 
around a curve, left the tracks and slammed into a row of houses at the foot of 
the treacherous Cajon Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific's operating rules "provided inadequate guidance" to Holland 
regarding the allowable speed and braking requirements, said Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Other engineers probably had done the same thing . . . following SP's 
operating guidelines," he said. The difference this time was that the train 
carried more weight than the crew had been told or for which it could 
compensate in time to make a difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were totally misinformed about something that was fundamental to the 
operation of the train," Lauber said. His argument persuaded the other board 
members to place the bulk of the responsibility for the wreck on the railroad 
managers and operating procedures. 
</P>
<P>
As for the pipeline accident, the board agreed without debate that "Calnev's 
pipeline was mechanically dented and gouged at several locations by earthmoving 
equipment," resulting in a rupture that initially emitted gas fumes into the 
air and later ignited to produce a firestorm over the community. 
</P>
<P>
They declined to say how the accident occurred or whose piece of equipment was 
directly responsible, noting that they could not be precise. 
</P>
<P>
"Calnev's and Southern Pacific's surveillance of excavating equipment 
operations was insufficient to prevent damage to Calnev's pipeline," the board 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Anderson, a vice president at Southern Pacific in San Francisco, said 
that while he had not yet read the NTSB's report, the company long ago accepted 
responsibility for the derailment and thus did not disagree with the safety 
board's primary conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the worst train wrecks in our company's history . . . and we 
will pay close attention to the (NTSB's) recommendations," Anderson said. "We 
have already spent a good bit of time since (the derailment) trying to make 
sure it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Anderson said, many of the recommendations included in the safety 
board's report had been implemented by the company or will be in the near 
future. These include modifications in engineers' emergency training, changes 
in the listing of cargo weights to improve accuracy, and regulations to improve 
communications among crew members. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for GATX Terminals Corp., Chicago-based parent of Calnev Pipe 
Line Co., said there would be no immediate comment on the NTSB findings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their specific comments on the twin accidents, the safety board 
faulted San Bernardino's land use planning for failing to address the hazards 
posed by allowing railroads and high-pressure gas pipelines in close proximity 
to residential communities.

BERKELEY GROUP BIDS TO LOOSEN RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 300-member group of Berkeley landlords and homeowners has launched an effort 
that would crush one of California's strongest rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative by the Black Property Owners Assn. would exempt from rent 
control at least 11,428 Berkeley dwellings, or more than 70% of the apartments 
and houses covered by the city's 10-year-old law, according to rent control 
officials. The measure could go before voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
"You would effectively end rent control as it's known in Berkeley," said Joseph 
Brooks, executive director of the city Rent Stabilization Board. "You would 
have an across-the-board rent hike, from a low of a few percentage points to a 
doubling or tripling in some cases." 
</P>
<P>
The measure calls for exempting from rent control all single-family homes and 
any apartments renting for less than 65% of what the federal government 
considers fair market price for comparable local housing. 
</P>
<P>
During a petition drive that began last Friday, the Berkeley property owners 
group gathered about 3,480 signatures, 1,000 more than needed to qualify the 
measure for the ballot. City officials must verify the names on the petition. 
</P>
<P>
Rent control proponents say weakening the law would make affordable housing 
scarce. The initiative's sponsors say the ordinance already has caused many 
small rental property owners to leave Berkeley. The proposed changes, they say, 
will help property owners get what they believe is a fair return on their 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would provide relief to landlords who had been charging low 
rents when the Berkeley ordinance froze rents in 1980, said Jim Smith, 
president of the property owners association, a group composed mainly of black 
apartment owners and homeowners. With only annual cost-of-living increases, 
owners are unable to make a fair profit and enough money to keep up their 
properties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years of rent control and deferred maintenance catches up to you," Smith 
said. "Eventually, you get to the point where your building is in such bad 
condition you can't get desirable tenants." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, monthly rental rates in Alameda and Contra Costa counties range from 
$533 for an efficiency to $1,068 for a four-bedroom apartment, a federal 
housing spokesman said. The initiative would remove rent control restrictions 
on efficiency apartments renting for less than $346, and on four-bedroom 
dwellings priced below $694 per month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Berkeley, 12 California cities, including Los Angeles, enforce 
some form of rent control, said Ken Baar, a Berkeley-based urban planner and 
rent control consultant. Unlike Los Angeles, Berkeley and five of the other 
cities bar owners from hiking rents when an apartment or house becomes vacant. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, rent control laws in Berkeley and the other five cities -- Santa 
Monica, East Palo Alto, West Hollywood, Palm Springs and Cotati -- are 
considered tougher than those in cities such as Los Angeles, according to rent 
control experts. 
</P>
<P>
Proportionately, Berkeley and Santa Monica have four times as many dwellings 
with rents frozen at long ago levels than does Los Angeles, where longtime 
tenants are the only ones who pay below fair market value, said Allan Heskin, 
an urban planning professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is between a rent control law, like Berkeley's, that says 
you're trying to maintain affordable housing, and one (such as the ordinance in 
Los Angeles) that says you're trying to protect the current tenant," Heskin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative's sponsors missed a June 11 deadline to guarantee the measure a 
place on November's ballot. The only way to get the measure on the November 
ballot is for city officials to verify the signatures in less than the 30 days 
they are allowed by law, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever it appears on the ballot, the question is bound to grab voters' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Rent control is the biggest issue in Berkeley, and this is a major effort at 
amending the rent control laws," Smith said. "There will be a heavy turnout on 
both sides."

DESERT TOWN LONER HUNTED AFTER HE AND 2 GIRLS VANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pioneertown is a place apart, a tiny desert outpost on the road to nowhere. 
Once a backdrop for Hollywood Westerns, the town today is home to folks fed up 
with street lights and sidewalks, with crowds and freeways, with city noise and 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Erickson, acquaintances say, is just such a person. A loner who lived in a 
rustic cabin that lacked utilities, Erickson, 36, is "quiet, not the social 
type at all," recalled the town's postmaster, Doreen Thompson. "He had a box 
here once, but that was years ago. Haven't seen him much since." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Erickson left Pioneertown, 75 miles east of San Bernardino. Moving 
on is not unusual for desert dwellers, but Erickson did not depart alone. 
Setting off on what he described as an errand, the bearded handyman took two 
neighbor girls -- Silver Putnam, 6, and her 3-year-old half sister, Kristina 
Johnson -- along with him. 
</P>
<P>
The three have not been home since. 
</P>
<P>
Locals, noting that Erickson was a longtime resident and friend of the family, 
initially suspected the episode was a misunderstanding. But authorities 
disagree and are treating the case as a kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 volunteers and San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies are 
combing the surrounding desert and mountains for signs of Erickson and the 
girls, while authorities from Sacramento to El Centro are following up on 
reported sightings of the primer-gray pickup truck he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
"The reports are coming in from everywhere," Sgt. Dennis Casey said. But so 
far, "we just don't have any solid developments." 
</P>
<P>
As the hunt intensified Tuesday, the people of Pioneertown grew worried. At 
first many figured it was all a mistake, that Erickson -- a camping enthusiast 
-- had merely taken the girls for a weekend outing and would call any time to 
straighten things out. 
</P>
<P>
But doubts and a sense of dread have crowded out those optimistic musings. At 
the post office and in the handful of businesses along Pioneertown's dusty main 
thoroughfare, conversations Tuesday echoed a single theme: Had something awful 
happened to Silver and Kristina, and could another community member be to 
blame? 
</P>
<P>
"It's spooky, like a bad dream," said Harriet Allen, owner of Pappy and 
Harriet's Pioneertown Palace, the community's only restaurant. "We're a small 
town, and these are all people we know. It's not like somebody you read about 
in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson vanished with the brown-haired, brown-eyed sisters about 12:30 p.m. 
Friday. A neighbor of the family, he was working that day on a motorcycle at 
the Parson's Ranch Road home of Linda Johnson, her daughters, Silver and 
Kristina, and her boyfriend, Paul Frisbe. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he needed a part, Erickson borrowed the family's 1968 Chevrolet pickup 
to drive to town. Frisbe allowed Silver, who had graduated from kindergarten 
just hours earlier, and Kristina to go along. 
</P>
<P>
When they failed to return, Frisbe went to Erickson's house to investigate. 
There, he found a backpack and ice chest missing. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed, Frisbe followed the truck's tracks along Pioneertown's sandy roads for 
seven miles, but the trail ended at the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since, sheriff's deputies and a small army of volunteers have 
plastered the area with flyers bearing pictures of the missing girls and of 
Erickson, described as 5-feet, 8-inches tall, heavyset, with blue eyes, a full 
black beard and black hair usually worn in a ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are also searching parks and national forests throughout the West 
because of Erickson's known passion for the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has been postmaster for 16 years, said the girls' disappearance 
has sent a spasm of fear through Pioneertown. 
</P>
<P>
"All the women with little ones are particularly upset," she said. "When you 
lose two little girls, it hits home." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a 15-year-resident of Pioneertown who has known Silver and Kristina 
"since birth," called Pioneertown "a peaceful, family-oriented place" where 
kidnaping "is not supposed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place where you trust each other. You may not see a lot of your 
neighbors, but you trust them." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, note that the girls' disappearance is not the first strange 
episode to unfold in or near Pioneertown. The town got its start as a movie 
set, but later its isolation made it an attractive haven for Hells Angels. 
Today, authorities say, the rugged region harbors drug labs and cults. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, third-grader Sylvia Mangos was kidnaped from a swap meet just down the 
road from Pioneertown and later found murdered. And Laura Bradbury, the 
Huntington Beach girl who disappeared in 1984, was abducted from nearby Joshua 
Tree. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had more than their fair share of unhappy things out there," sheriff's 
spokesman Jim Bryant said. "The desert attracts good people, but it attracts a 
lot of bad people too."

MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN ART STOLEN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PART OWNER OF VAN NUYS AGENCY IS TIED UP BY MASKED ROBBER. ABOUT 1,000 
CONTEMPORARY WORKS WERE TAKEN IN THE HEIST, INCLUDING OIL PAINTINGS, 
LITHOGRAPHS AND SERIGRAPHS.

<P>
An armed man in a "ninja-style" mask tied up a part-owner of a Van Nuys art 
agency and distribution house, then escaped in the company's van with artworks 
reportedly worth more than $1 million, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The robber, who police said might have had accomplices, took more than 1,000 
artworks, including three oil paintings and hundreds of lithographs and 
serigraphs from Eagle Limited's warehouse near the Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Silver, 43, one of the agency's owners, was tied up and taped to a chair 
during the Monday night robbery. Later, he dialed 911 on an office phone with 
his toes to summon police. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Klein, director of marketing for Eagle Limited, said only works by 
contemporary artists Ramon Lombarte, Sonya Fe and Roberto Chichorro were taken. 
They included three oils by Lombarte with a total retail value of $78,000. 
</P>
<P>
Also taken were more than 300 lithographs by Lombarte, 300 serigraphs by 
Chichorro and 200 lithographs by Fe. The lithographs and serigraphs were valued 
at $1,000 to $2,200 each by Eagle Limited, according to Linda Worrell, 
president and a part-owner of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sure we are talking about at least 1,000 pieces," Worrell said Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Though police originally reported that $4.6 million worth of artworks were 
taken, Worrell later downgraded the estimated loss to $1.2 million to $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The three artists whose works were taken are not well-known in the fine art 
market, although paintings and prints by Lombarte are sold in some galleries 
for up to $65,000. The Merrill Chase gallery chain, based in Chicago, sells the 
Spanish artist's stark, realistic paintings for prices ranging from $20,000 to 
$65,000, according to Lynn Marks, an art consultant with the company. She said 
his lithographs, unframed, go for $1,195 to $1,495. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Barnes, director of the Landmark Gallery in La Jolla, said Lombarte 
paintings sell there for between $10,000 and $30,000. The gallery, which also 
carries works by popular artists such as Leroy Nieman and Erte, hosted a 
Lombarte exhibition last year. 
</P>
<P>
Works by Fe, a Los Angeles artist who specializes in colorful paintings of 
children and small animals, are less well known. Paul Sorota, who owns a 
gallery in Boston, said he has sold a small number of her lithographs for about 
$600 each. 
</P>
<P>
The third artist, Mozambique-born Chichorro, is just now having his works 
introduced to this country, according to Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other originals and lithographs by other artists were left behind 
in the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew exactly what they wanted," Worrell said. "They didn't waste time. 
They went directly for the Lombarte originals. They took the most expensive 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
The losses were covered by insurance, Eagle Limited officials said. The three 
Lombarte originals were oil on linen. The robber took them down from walls of 
the business, including the wall behind Silver's desk, and removed them from 
their frames. 
</P>
<P>
The lithographs and serigraphs were taken from storage drawers. Complete 
editions of 285 prints were taken from some drawers, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Silver is an attorney in Boston and visits the business once or twice a month 
to oversee contracts and other paper work. While he was working in his office 
alone Monday about 8 p.m., the robber entered through the unlocked front door. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a gun but he didn't point it at me," Silver said. "He had on what I 
call a ninja-style mask. It was black and pulled down over his face. He said 
only four words, 'Don't move,' and then, 'Stand up.' I did what I was told. I 
didn't want to try to be a hero while he had the gun."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED IN 1982 DRUNK-DRIVING DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who eluded police for eight years after causing a 1982 crash in Reseda 
that killed two women pleaded no contest Tuesday to manslaughter, drunk driving 
and other charges and agreed to a prison sentence of three years and eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Perez Lemon, 28, of Woodland Hills, entered the plea after prosecutors 
said they would not seek the maximum sentence for the charges -- four years and 
four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled for July 12 in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Hanzlik of Granada Hills, the mother of one of the women killed, fought 
successfully after her daughter's death for tougher sentences for convicted 
drunk drivers. But the new sentences do not apply to Lemon because the crash 
occurred before they went into effect.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAX OFFICER SENTENCED FOR MOLESTING 2 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Los Angeles International Airport police officer who admitted sexually 
assaulting two women while he was on patrol has been sentenced to two years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Julian Lopez, 32, made a tearful statement of remorse before he was 
sentenced by Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Irwin H. Garfinkel, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, hired by the airport police department in 1984 and fired following his 
1988 arrest, pleaded no contest in April to charges of sexually molesting the 
women during two separate incidents. In both cases, Lopez ordered women to get 
in his patrol car and assaulted them.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $520,000 AWARD OKD IN SHOOTING BY DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday approved paying $520,000 to settle a 
lawsuit filed in the fatal shooting of a Pico Rivera man by sheriff's deputies 
during a 1987 family dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Solis, 28, a self-employed contractor, was shot to death after 
allegedly fighting with deputies called to break up a disturbance at the home 
of his girlfriend, county lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement will be divided among the woman, Sarah Lilian Chavez Donis of 
Los Angeles; Solis' estranged wife, Liduvina Reyes of Bakersfield, and his six 
children, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
A county counsel's report to supervisors recommended the settlement, saying 
that "should plaintiffs establish liability . . . a jury could return a verdict 
substantially greater than the proposed settlement."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JEWELRY WORTH $35,000 TAKEN FROM MALL 
STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thieves wielding a sledgehammer broke into the Hudson-Goodman jewelry store 
inside the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance early Tuesday, removing an 
estimated $35,000 worth of watches, bracelets and other jewelry from 13 display 
cases, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves also smashed two outside display cases at the nearby Del Amo Jewelry 
Mart on Carson Street in Torrance, taking what police described as costume 
jewelry. Sgt. Ronald Traber said police recovered a sledgehammer outside the 
Jewelry Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Traber said thieves broke into the fashion center, then smashed a large glass 
door at Hudson-Goodman and entered the store. The thieves did not enter the 
Jewelry Mart but instead broke into the two outside display cases containing 
gold-plated jewelry with artificial stones, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were alerted to the thefts when a security alarm was activated at 
Hudson-Goodman at about 3:25 a.m., Traber said.

MOLINA, ALATORRE COOPERATE TO BLOCK OLVERA STREET BIDS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: THE TWO COUNCIL MEMBERS, WHO HAVE BEEN FEUDING OVER THE 
REVITALIZATION PROJECT, JOINED IN A 12-0 VOTE TO VOID THE REQUEST FOR 
DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina tried to 
cool down their heated public quarrel over the future of Olvera Street on 
Tuesday by persuading their colleagues to attempt to block a request for bids 
to revitalize the tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare show of unity on the politically explosive issue, the two Eastside 
politicians agreed during the regularly scheduled council meeting that the 
request for bids on the $30-million project approved last week by the city 
Parks and Recreation Commission was a mistake and should be voided. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre and Molina also agreed that jurisdiction over the Mexican marketplace 
should be taken away from the commission. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that spirit that the two agreed, for the moment, to set aside their 
differences -- which included a tense spat Monday during a council committee 
meeting -- and voted to delay the request for development proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The full council vote was 12 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't need to be a fight, Richard," Molina said before the vote, 
looking across the council chamber at Alatorre. ". . . Because there should be 
unity. The reality is, when you build issues like this, you must build a 
consensus. And a consensus requires listening to everybody, not just one side." 
</P>
<P>
Then Molina, who favors creation of a new citizens commission to govern Olvera 
Street, told Alatorre, who favors a nonprofit corporation, that she would vote 
for his motion Tuesday seeking the nullification of last week's commission 
action. She had introduced a similar proposal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to build for tomorrow, let's start anew, Richard," Molina said. 
"Let's accept your motion, which is no different than my motion. Let's accept 
your leadership on Olvera Street. But you must insure the protection of the 
goals of the people who are there." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, in whose council district Olvera Street is located, was equally as 
conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
"From the onset, my commitment has always been to the merchants and to 
preserving the historical integrity of that street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can argue our (different) positions (to improve Olvera Street), but 
whatever comes out, it's going to be the best thing for everybody concerned 
because the street is not just a street that is owned by the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a historical landmark that is owned by the people of the city of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The scene Tuesday was much different from Monday's emotional showdown, when the 
two lawmakers argued over how best to accomplish the revitalization project -- 
the citizens commission or the nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Both politicians were on a collision course after they expressed unhappiness 
over different aspects of last week's parks commission vote. 
</P>
<P>
Molina was upset that the commission, without public input, dismantled a 
carefully crafted compromise that would have allowed groups of merchants to buy 
up to a 50% interest in the upgrading project. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, on the other hand, disagreed with the commission's decision to 
include the restoration of Italian Hall, a former meeting hall for people with 
Italian roots that is now used as a storage area, as part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The revitalization issue, fueled by fears that Olvera Street could lose its 
quaint Mexican flavor because of the project, prompted wild rumors and 
speculations that pitted Molina and her supporters against Alatorre's. 
</P>
<P>
Most prominent among those was the charge that Alatorre would use his influence 
to give the project to The East Los Angeles Community Union, a controversial 
Eastside developer that was forced several years ago to refund federal monies 
because of spending abuses and irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, who has received political and financial support from TELACU, has 
denied that. 
</P>
<P>
Some Eastside politicos were hopeful late Tuesday that Olvera Street's future 
could now be discussed in a more constructive manner. 
</P>
<P>
"This crap of Mexican arguing against Mexican has got to stop," said one 
Eastside insider, who asked that his name not be used. "I hope Richard and 
Gloria, and I love them both, will be more gracious about this. If they don't, 
que lastima (what a pity). . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that sentiment, the two council members are unlikely to become allies 
over the issue. That much seemed evident after the council action, when the two 
met separately with reporters to push their own proposals to save Olvera 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
They did not acknowledge each other, speaking not a word, as they met in a 
crowd of reporters assembled to hear their comments. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said her proposed citizens' commission was ideally suited to govern 
Olvera Street, because it would maximize public scrutiny, something Alatorre's 
nonprofit corporation might preclude. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre disagreed, contending that a nonprofit group could have all the public 
scrutiny the council wanted it to have. It would also prevent anyone with 
financial interest in Olvera Street from getting an advantage from 
participation in such a group, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent move to take jurisdiction away from the parks commission is not 
likely to meet with any opposition from its members, said Commission President 
J. Stanley Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude is, let the independent group have at it," he said. "It may be a 
slap in the face . . . (but) we're comfortable with the decision we made."

HAIR FIBERS LINKED TO CAMARENA CASE SUSPECT; 
</P>
<P>
FORENSICS: FBI EXPERT TESTIFIES THAT THE EVIDENCE FOUND IN THE MURDER HOUSE 
MATCHES SAMPLES TAKEN FROM ONE OF FOUR MEN ON TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An FBI forensics expert testified Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court that 
hair fibers found in the house where U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was 
murdered matched hair samples taken from defendant Juan Ramon Matta 
Ballesteros' head after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Matta is one of four men being tried in Camarena's abduction and murder. Matta, 
45, contends that he was not at the house in Guadalajara, Mexico, where the 
agent was interrogated and killed in February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
FBI expert Michael Malone testified that the two hair fibers matched Matta's in 
20 separate characteristics and that there was no way in which they were 
dissimilar. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination by Matta's lawyer, Michael Burns, Malone ac knowledged 
that a hair sample is not considered the conclusive identifying evidence that a 
fingerprint is. Malone also acknowledged that every time he files a report on 
hair fiber tests, he includes a qualifying statement to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the hair evidence could be considered significant by the jury, depending 
on the findings of a second expert that have not yet been revealed in court. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, Matta's lawyers won the right to have another forensic 
expert compare the hair fibers using a technique that the defense expert 
considers more sophisticated than the process utilized by Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Martin R. Stolar, Matta's lead attorney, said his expert has examined the same 
hairs and his findings would be revealed "at the appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
Malone testified all day about attempts made by various U.S. government 
agencies to secure whatever forensic evidence they could from the Guadalajara 
house where Camarena was tortured. The house was owned by Rafael Caro Quintero, 
a Mexican drug lord now imprisoned in Mexico after being convicted on charges 
stemming from the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI expert said U.S. officials were frustrated because by the time they got 
to examine the house -- two months after the murder -- the premises had been 
partially sanitized. He said walls in the house had been painted and he found 
it odd that other parts of the two-story house were still grimy. 
</P>
<P>
Malone also testified that Mexican Federal Judicial Police prohibited U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration officials from completing their examination of the 
house and the adjoining outside area, after the DEA agents found a license 
plate that had been stripped from one of the cars used in Camarena's kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The witness said that after the bent license plate was found in a grate near a 
tennis court the Mexican police officials took considerably more interest in 
what the American officials were doing and telephoned their superiors at 
Judicial Police headquarters. After that call, Malone said, the Mexican police 
prevented the U.S. agents from further examining the house and seized the 
license plate. Malone said, however, that the U.S. officials were permitted to 
photograph the license plate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these frustrations, Malone said, the FBI was able to gather up 
considerable forensic evidence at the house, including hairs that matched known 
hairs of Camarena and other persons indicted in the case -- including Sergio 
Espino Verdin, the Mexican police official who has been identified as one of 
the principal interrogators of Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments Tuesday, Stolar debated with prosecutors on whether the 
government should be compelled to provide documents and records about any 
relationship between Matta, co-indictee Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and any 
agencies of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer asserted that there is a 1987 DEA report stating that Felix 
and Matta had arranged with U.S. officials to engage in arms smuggling and drug 
smuggling in aid of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors Manuel Medrano and John Carlton have denied that any such 
report exists. In court papers, they have asserted that Stolar is engaged in a 
fishing expedition and that, in any case, such a report would have no relevence 
to the murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Stolar countered by saying that he has subpoenaed the report because it would 
prove that the alleged racketeering charges in the indictment against his 
client did not violate federal laws, "because they were sanctioned, approved 
and authorized by the United States government." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said he would rule on the motions shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for defendant Javier Vasquez Velasco also charged that the 
government had withheld information that could help exonerate his client. 
Rafeedie said he would rule on that issue after he receives the government's 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprising announcement, prosecutors said they expected to call only four 
more witnesses and could wrap up their case by the end of the week.

WANDERING BELL GARDENS OFFICER UNDERGOES PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wandering Bell Gardens police officer who told authorities he blacked out 
last week and regained consciousness 12 hours, and two counties, later has been 
undergoing psychological tests to determine what caused his curious desert 
pilgrimage, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Larimore, 35, who disappeared in a patrol car early Friday, was 
picked up unharmed later that day in Victorville -- a Mojave Desert city 28 
miles north of San Bernardino -- after a massive search by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bell Gardens police have refused to comment on details of the case, 
saying that Larimore's mental condition is a private matter, San Bernardino 
County sheriff's detectives said the officer was being interviewed by doctors 
and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Warren Nobles said that he had been briefed by Larimore's 
commander about the missing officer's despondency over a marital rift and his 
failure to be promoted within the department. 
</P>
<P>
"In Bell Gardens, (Police Chief William Donohoe) said they were looking at all 
possible explanations about what happened," Nobles said. "There were some 
marital, financial and job problems that came up in the discussion. . . . Those 
may have been issues." 
</P>
<P>
Larimore, an 11-year veteran who lives in Long Beach, had arrived early for 
work on Friday, changed into his uniform, and left the station before morning 
roll call, sheriff's spokeswoman Denise Garland said. After repeated attempts 
to reach Larimore by radio, Bell Gardens police began searching for him. 
Sheriff's deputies joined the effort after Larimore's car was found. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was found walking in the neighborhood of a friend who was a Bell 
Gardens officer for eight years and is now a sheriff's deputy stationed in 
Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Michael Stout said Larimore's desert visit was curious as well as 
unannounced. Larimore, who has visited Victorville in the past, said he had 
been wandering on foot for about five hours and wasn't certain where he was, 
Stout told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Garland said of Larimore: "Not knowing where he was or how he got there was 
very disturbing to him." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Larimore did not remember going to work or driving in the 
squad car earlier that day. The abandoned car had been found earlier, parked in 
the middle of a construction site in downtown Victorville. Larimore's uniform 
shirt, police identification and service revolver were on the front seat. The 
keys were in the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
Garland said Larimore recently had been treated for "severe headaches," but at 
the time he was found, he "did not appear to be under the influence of any 
drug." 
</P>
<P>
"He simply seemed apprehensive, almost frightened, about where he had been," 
she said.

ROCKET FUEL TRANSPORTATION STUDY FAVORS TRUCKS OVER TRAINS, BARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force has concluded that transporting dangerous rocket fuel to 
Vandenberg Air Force Base by rail through the San Fernando Valley and Ventura 
County deserves further study after an 18-month review of other means of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost, however, the study found that the Air Force practice now of trucking 
the fuel through Southern California is preferable to shipping it by barge 
through the Panama Canal or transporting it by rail. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the study found that transporting the 
volatile chemicals -- which are both poisonous and explosive -- by barge is not 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
While officials decided that moving the fuel by rail through the San Fernando 
Valley merits further review, they found that trucking it through the Mojave 
Desert north of Los Angeles remains the best option, Capt. Sigmund Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The study was requested by Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) in 1987 in 
response to reports that fuel components used to launch military rockets were 
being shipped by truck on the Ventura Freeway through the densely populated San 
Fernando Valley and northward through Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force redirected the shipments after elected officials from the San 
Gabriel Valley, the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County protested. 
</P>
<P>
A northern highway route through less-populated Barstow, Mojave, Gorman, 
Mariposa and Santa Maria was selected. 
</P>
<P>
"These propellants have been shipped via tank trailer over the nation's 
highways for more than 25 years without a single recordable accident or 
incident resulting in a spill or major loss of product while in transit," said 
officials at the San Antonio Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base in 
San Antonio. The center conducted the study for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited regulations prohibiting bulk shipments of rocket fuels by 
barge. It said that in an accident, either alternative method could jeopardize 
more people than trucking because barges and rail cars would carry larger 
shipments than trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino has asked the House Merchant Marine Committee and Fisheries and 
Government Operations Committee to review the nearly 200-page study, which was 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lagomarsino expressed disappointment that the Air Force did not fully 
assess the prospect that shipping the rocket fuel by barge could enhance 
safety. He also dismissed consideration of the rail option. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear on the face of it the rail shipment would expose many more 
people to risk than the current truck routing," said John Doherty, a senior 
aide to Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
Rail shipments would be carried on the Southern Pacific Railroad coastal route, 
which parallels the Ventura Freeway though the San Fernando Valley, eastern 
Ventura County and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen tetroxide is transported across seven states from Vicksburg, Miss., 
where it is manufactured in 3,057-gallon tank trucks under contract to the Air 
Force. As many as two rocket fuel shipments are made each month, depending on 
Vandenberg's launch schedule, although there have been none so far this year, 
said Phoebe Brown, a San Antonio Air Logistics Center spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean transport proposal would have shipped the fuel by barge from 
Vicksburg down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, through the Panama 
Canal and past Mexico to the California coast.

PASSAGE OF NEA BILL IS RATED 'LESS THAN 50-50'; 
</P>

A $49,500 NEA GRANT.

A divided House committee, underscoring deep, unresolved disagreements in 
Congress over the National Endowment for the Arts, voted Tuesday to send a bill 
-- renewing the agency without restrictions for another five years -- to the 
full House for a mid-July confrontation over public financing of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of an unusual bipartisan agreement, the bill was voted out of 
the House Education and Labor Committee without amendment and with practically 
no debate. The action indicates that the controversy over the endowment's 
future remains so intense that no attempt at bipartisan consensus was possible. 
Indeed, at the Tuesday session chaired by Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D-Los 
Angeles), both Republicans and Democrats deserted the positions of their 
respective subcommittee leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In a dour post-mortem on the committee vote, the chairman of the subcommittee 
that had initial responsibility for the NEA bill told reporters that chances 
are "less than 50-50" the arts endowment can emerge from the political crisis 
without restrictions being clamped on the kinds and specific subject matter of 
artwork it can support. 
</P>
<P>
"The NEA will never be the same, regardless of what happens with this bill," 
said Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.). "To be perfectly frank, we need to develop 
the best possible strategy for the floor if the NEA is to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a prominent theater organization in NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer's 
home state of Oregon has become the latest group to refuse an NEA grant in 
protest of a 1990 endowment requirement that grant recipients pledge not to 
produce obscene work. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, the oldest regional theater organization in 
the country, said Tuesday it had rejected a $49,500 NEA grant. The festival, 
which has a total budget of about $10 million, said its decision was influenced 
by the move to reject $72,000 in NEA funding announced last week by Los Angeles 
choreographer Bella Lewitzky. More than a half dozen artists or arts groups 
have now turned down NEA support in the obscenity dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the festival in Ashland, Ore., said its board voted unanimously 
to reject the money even though the decision might worsen the political dilemma 
of Frohnmayer, a former Oregon lawyer. "We certainly see it as a beleaguered 
organization," said a festival spokeswoman, "but loyalty to John could not take 
precedence over what is really a moral issue." 
</P>
<P>
The House action here followed a morning meeting between House Speaker Thomas 
S. Foley (D-Mass.) and the two leaders of the House NEA bill, Williams and Rep. 
Tom Coleman (R-Mo.). At the meeting, Foley -- who had previously given signals 
that he wanted at least some of the major disputes over the NEA resolved at the 
committee level -- agreed to allow the bill to come to the floor essentially 
unchanged from the version originally proposed by President Bush earlier this 
year. Under the agreement, the House will take up the NEA's fate during either 
the week of July 15 or July 22. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Education and Labor Committee has set next Wednesday for its 
consideration of the NEA bill. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the House strategy was described by Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa), 
a former actor, as "the last cease-fire on this issue" before what is expected 
to be a bruising, highly charged floor debate in the House and, slightly later, 
in the Senate. "You cannot have art without risk," Grandy declared. "If you 
can, it's not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
The bill sent to the floor was first drafted as the Bush Administration's 
proposal for NEA extension, although the Administration has since signaled that 
it would accept some restrictions on the content of NEA-funded art and would 
settle for a one- or three-year extension of the NEA's life, instead of the 
five years originally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The bill faces at least two major attempts at complete substitute language -- 
including one led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), who has vowed to alter 
the legislation so it abolishes the NEA entirely, and another by Coleman and 
Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.), who propose to carve up the arts endowment so 
the amount of money it funnels directly to state arts councils is tripled, to 
60%. The Coleman-Gunderson plan would also write into the NEA law the same 
obscenity-restriction language incorporated in a 1974 Supreme Court ruling that 
stands as the operative case law on the subject across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Both Coleman and Williams acknowledged that they are negotiating over the final 
language of the bill. The situation appeared to indicate that the most 
permissive legislation arts supporters can hope to see emerge from Congress 
would increase NEA money channeled directly to the states and include some form 
of specific regulatory language governing art content. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that, because of the circumstances, this agency is at political 
risk," said Coleman of the 14-month controversy over the NEA that began last 
year with a dispute over NEA support of an exhibit that included a photograph 
of a crucifix immersed in urine. Asked how serious the political tremor set off 
by the NEA has become, Williams said, "on a scale of 1-to-10, it's a 7."

L.A. OPERA'S 'OKLAHOMA!' WON'T BE OPERATIC; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN LANDMARK OPENS FRIDAY AT THE CHANDLER 
PAVILION. 'THE KEY PHRASE HERE IS "MUSICAL THEATER," ' SAYS ITS DIRECTOR. 
</P>

<P>
With its simple story line and unlikely opening -- a woman churning butter on 
stage while an offstage voice sings about the beautiful mornin' -- it's hard to 
think of "Oklahoma!" as a revolutionary stage work. 
</P>
<P>
But when it premiered on Broadway in 1943, this maiden effort of composer 
Richard Rodgers and lyricist-librettist Oscar Hammerstein II was hailed as the 
first musical to seamlessly integrate book, songs and dance to tell its story. 
The songs and Agnes de Mille's stylish choreography broke custom by defining 
and advancing the plot rather than serving as diversions. The show ran for more 
than five years and 2,200 Broadway performances -- a record unsurpassed until 
"My Fair Lady" in 1961 -- and set the standard for musicals for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, is this quintessential slice of musical theater being staged by an 
opera company? 
</P>
<P>
"Because the key phrase here is 'musical theater,' " said Charles Abbott, 
director of the Los Angeles Music Center Opera production, which opens Friday 
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 12 performances, through July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a part of our theater heritage, the only stage form America has 
contributed. Why shouldn't opera companies have it in their libraries? For 
economic reasons, most Broadway shows today don't have casts this big -- 44 
people and a horse -- and certainly touring shows don't. So only an opera 
company can have a cast that size. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oklahoma!' is simple, sophisticated and quietly classy," he added. "It's not 
a step back for opera companies to do it. They're keeping our heritage alive, 
and at the same time, it's good business." 
</P>
<P>
Starring in this classic about young love in the expanding American West are 
Jean Stapleton as Aunt Eller and Rodney Gilfrey and Rebecca Eichenberger as the 
on-again-off-again couple, Curly and Laurey. Also featured are Lara Teeter as 
Will Parker, Jodi Benson -- the voice of Disney's animated "Little Mermaid" -- 
as Ado Annie, Larry Storch as comic peddler Ali Hakim and Michael Gallup as 
menacing farmhand Jud Fry. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Opera production was initially designed two years ago by Abbott, 
choreographer Mary Jane Houdina and set designer John Lee Beatty for the 
Minnesota Opera, with a subsequent staging by Opera Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
"Our approach to staging this hasn't been different because it's an opera 
company," Abbott noted. "What is different is the casting -- we have an 
interesting marriage of opera singers, musical-theater singers and celebrities 
with musical-theater and acting backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"My task is to lead the opera singers to mute their performances, while also 
trying to have the musical-theater performers sing as finely as they can. We've 
found that everyone's nurturing each other -- it's a very enriching 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton is perhaps best known for her TV work: her eight-year, three-time 
Emmy-winning run as Edith Bunker on "All in the Family," and this season's 
"Bagdad Cafe" (which has been renewed). But her early career was on the stage 
and she has appeared in four Broadway musicals, including "Damn Yankees" and 
"Bells Are Ringing" in the mid-'50s. 
</P>
<P>
Her role in "Oklahoma!" as the strong, independent farm woman has only solo 
lines rather than songs, but Stapleton quickly dismissed the notion that she 
was cast because of her celebrity status and audience drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
"Fame is something that's imposed. It has its advantages, of course, but it's 
not reality when it comes to the work," she said after a rehearsal last week. 
"That's not in the script. You're an ensemble, and you always will be." 
</P>
<P>
Having performed "Oklahoma!" twice before (the last time in the early '80s), 
Stapleton said, "The only real difference in doing this show with an opera 
company is that they take the day off before we open. That's an opera 
necessity. Otherwise, we're doing a musical." 
</P>
<P>
While Stapleton has made minimal performance adjustments, it has been a vastly 
different story for castmate Gallup, who plays the brooding, dangerous Jud Fry. 
An L.A. Opera veteran particularly known for his comic buffo roles, the 
bass-baritone said that his first musical-theater role is "quite a stretch for 
me, a dramatic, physical and vocal challenge. I can't get 'opera,' ever. I 
can't do (big) gestures. In rehearsal, Charles might say, 'That turn is too 
operatic. Make it real.' I have to modulate my voice to sound more like I'm 
speaking, and since I'm wearing a body mike, I can't let my voice go because it 
would fry the system." 
</P>
<P>
Though Gallup's song of romantic frustration, "Lonely Room," is often likened 
to an aria, he still must adapt to the musical-theater style. "In opera," he 
explained, "a lot of questions of tempo, dynamics and emotion will be answered 
by the music, what the composer has written. In musical theater, you're freer 
-- you can vary the tempo because you don't have musical constraints. I may 
have a whole bunch of eighth-notes" -- he sings an excerpt from "Lonely Room" 
-- "but it's all conversational. There's no way you could notate exactly what I 
sang, and I probably wouldn't do it again in exactly the same way." 
</P>
<P>
In this new medium, Gallup is also contending with dialogue -- in Oklahoma 
vernacular, no less -- dancing and stunts. And, he said, "All the 
musical-theater people are so much more in shape -- they sing, dance, act, even 
mime. Even though I lost 25 pounds for this role, I still feel chunky." 
</P>
<P>
While this "Oklahoma!"is very much in the musical-theater tradition, Abbott 
notes that some elements do differ from the original production. "It was always 
my intention to cut into the length of the dances," he said. "In 1943 there was 
no such thing as television, so entertainment lasted longer. Now, audiences are 
used to their entertainment happening in a much shorter time span. Mary Jane 
Houdina and I did our research and knew what each dance had to be about, but 
she did original choreography, with a nod in style to Agnes de Mille. 
</P>
<P>
"The design is not as lightly balletic," he added. "They used backdrops, as you 
would for ballet. John Lee Beatty has used the paintings of Grant Wood as an 
influence. The colors are brighter and deeper, and the forms are more sumptuous 
and earthy. Because of that, I think the choreography is earthier." 
</P>
<P>
Musical theater -- not to mention the world in general -- has changed a lot in 
the near half-century since "Oklahoma!" debuted. What does a show about cowboys 
and farmers, whose major issue was whom to take to a "box" social, have to 
offer 1990 audiences? 
</P>
<P>
Said Stapleton, "It's a human story, one of your few basic plots -- instead of 
an evening of marvelous theatrical wizardry -- which is rare in musical theater 
today. You can't beat the lyricism and the melody. And the dream ballet -- what 
a wonderful way to introduce children to ballet." 
</P>
<P>
Director Abbott is more succinct. "It's a damn good score and a damn good 
book," he said.

BURGER KING 'SIMPSONS' ADS DON'T CUT THE MUSTARD WITH NBC, ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Simpsons," the irascible cartoon that has helped put Fox on the television 
map, has become so popular that advertisers such as Butterfinger candy bars and 
Burger King are snapping up the characters as their corporate spokesfamily. But 
the move is proving as hazardous as one of Bart's cherry bombs. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and ABC have refused to accept the Butterfinger ads and both said this week 
that they also will reject Burger King's upcoming "Simpsons" commercials, part 
of the fast food chain's reported $20-million campaign scheduled to begin next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Both networks said that it is their policy to turn down commercials that 
cross-promote a program on a competing network. 
</P>
<P>
CBS maintains a similar policy of prohibiting ads that feature actors in 
character or on the set of a competitive show, but the network nonetheless has 
cleared both the Butterfinger and the proposed Burger King ads. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, the third-place network -- which is scrambling to lure 
the young viewers whom "The Simpsons" appeals to most -- said: "CBS recognizes 
that animated characters only exist in their on-screen persona. In an effort to 
support our advertisers' creative needs, CBS will generally approve the 
appearance of competitive animated characters, provided they do not name the 
program, or mention its time and date." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, of course, will also sell air time for the ads featuring its own first 
family, but network executives could not be reached to answer questions about 
whether the network has its own policy against ads starring characters from 
competing programs. 
</P>
<P>
The banning of "The Simpsons" ads is not unprecedented. Earlier this year, ABC 
and CBS rejected a Maxwell House coffee ad that featured NBC's "Today" show 
weatherman Willard Scott clowning it up with average folk. NBC has previously 
turned down spots that featured John Forsythe and Linda Evans pushing products 
connected with the "Dynasty" series on ABC, and another for BVD underwear with 
Larry Hagman dressed up as J.R. Ewing of CBS' "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
NBC also recently refused to air a Sprite soft drink commercial that showed 
Arsenio Hall, rival of its own Johnny Carson and David Letterman, on the set of 
his late-night talk show. The network accepted a variation of the Sprite ad, 
however, that still starred Hall but did not include his TV set. 
</P>
<P>
All the networks have been airing a Miller Lite beer campaign that features 
Woody Harrelson, who plays bartender Woody Boyd on NBC's "Cheers," in a 
cross-country bike race against several music and sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
David Horowitz, ABC's director of program information, said that "Woody 
Harrelson is his real name and, in our perception, he is not using his 
character's persona" -- even though the commercials hinge on his very-Woody 
(the character)-like dumbness and ebullient optimism in the face of 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cosby is also acceptable as a corporate pitchman, the networks said, as 
long as he appears as himself and not as his TV character, Dr. Cliff Huxtable. 
</P>
<P>
As for Burger King, a company spokeswoman declined comment on the problems with 
"The Simpsons" campaign, saying only, "stay tuned." When asked if that meant 
the fast food giant was considering altering the campaign because of problems 
with NBC and ABC, she said she could not say. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the two top-rated networks have turned a cold shoulder to the 
company's advertising dollars, Burger King does have alternatives beyond CBS 
and Fox. It can buy commercial time on cable networks -- which generally are 
happy for whatever advertising they can get -- and on syndicated and local TV 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rejecting the Burger King ads, ABC said that it is reviewing its policy 
about commercials with characters from other networks. ABC apparently is 
deciding whether preventing any inadvertent cross-promotion of competing 
programs is worth the loss of advertising dollars at a time when the major 
networks are losing audiences and potential revenue with every passing year. 
</P>
<P>
Neither ABC nor NBC would comment on how much ad revenue it stands to lose by 
turning down the Burger King ads. But Paul Schulman, whose Paul Schulman Co. 
buys advertising time for corporate clients, said that while the networks don't 
like to reject ads and cause problems with an advertiser as large as Burger 
King, it is unlikely that they will lose much by keeping these commercials off 
their air. 
</P>
<P>
"Burger King probably still wants to be on certain shows on NBC and, if they 
want to advertise during 'The Cosby Show' or 'Cheers,' they will have to do it 
with a different commercial," Schulman said. "They could still buy time (on ABC 
and NBC) with some other version and then air 'The Simpsons' commercial 
elsewhere."

POLICE WARNINGS QUESTIONED IN 2 LIVE CREW CASE; 
</P>
<P>
RAP: ATTORNEYS ON BOTH SIDES SEE DANGER OF 'PRIOR RESTRAINT' IN PRESSURING 
RECORD STORES AGAINST SELLING THE 'NASTY' ALBUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Attorneys on both sides of the 2 Live Crew obscenity furor in Florida are 
questioning whether law-enforcement agencies in other states aren't guilty of 
"prior restraint" by warning retailers that they may be arrested for selling 
the rap group's latest album. 
</P>
<P>
Police in San Antonio, Tex., Prince William County, Va., and in four counties 
in South Carolina are the first authorities outside Florida's Broward County to 
act on U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez's June 6 ruling that the group's "As 
Nasty as They Wanna Be" album is obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez spent almost a third of his 62-page ruling admonishing Broward County 
Sheriff Nick Navarro for the tactics his police used in a campaign to get 
retailers to remove the "Nasty" album from shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"The action of the Broward County sheriff's office in threatening retail music 
stores with arrest for selling the Nasty recording and presenting them with a 
copy of a probable cause order is hereby DECLARED unconstitutional as improper 
prior restraint of free speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth 
Amendments to the United States Constitution," Gonzalez wrote in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview this week, Nova University, Fla., law professor Bruce 
Rogow, who is the rap group's attorney, criticized the media for being lax in 
reporting the prior restraint provision of Gonzalez's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Few people realize that 2 Live Crew won a significant victory at the federal 
level," Rogow said from his home in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. "I suppose the reason 
the press isn't covering that part of the ruling is that prior restraint just 
isn't as sexy an issue as dirty language." 
</P>
<P>
John Jolley, the Florida attorney who represented Navarro and takes credit for 
the obscenity finding against 2 Live Crew, agreed that the prior restraint 
provision was a key element of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that other law-enforcement agencies considering 2 Live Crew 
obscenity prosecutions should consult the decision carefully before taking 
action. While the ruling is only legally binding in Florida's Broward, Dade and 
Palm Beach counties, Jolley said, its "psychological impact" has been spreading 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, I would say, based on the information that I've been given, the 
actions that police have taken to alert record-shop owners in San Antonio would 
not be consistent with what Judge Gonzalez laid out in his ruling," Jolley said 
in a telephone interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prior restraint can be generally defined as any condition imposed by the 
government on the publication of speech, according to the ruling. In recent 
months, police in other counties in Florida and in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and 
Alabama have exercised tactics similar to those criticized by Gonzalez to stop 
the sale of the "Nasty" album. In addition, the 47-store Toronto-based HMV 
Corp., Canada's third-largest record chain, also pulled the "Nasty" album from 
its shelves Monday following a warning from the Ontario Provincial Police 
Morality Squad. Dan Brenner, a UCLA law professor and First Amendment 
specialist, also criticized the media for failing to pay more attention to the 
significance of Gonzalez's prior restraint comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the reason local prosecutors (around the country) are continuing the 
practice (threatening prosecution for selling the album) is that the press has 
not printed anything about it," Brenner said. "The prior restraint information 
as spelled out by the judge in this ruling is very significant, in that it 
addresses the intimidating effect that police officers in uniforms brandishing 
a magistrate's order can have. 
</P>
<P>
"The same judge who found the album obscene, which is the only thing the press 
has reported about, ruled that frightening retailers with such actions is 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
The 2 Live Crew case began on March 9, when a state circuit judge ruled that 
there was probable cause to find the album obscene in Broward County. Following 
the ruling, police visited area record stores warning employees that they could 
be prosecuted under Florida obscenity statutes if they sold the record. As a 
result, retailers in 40 Broward County stores pulled the product from their 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's federal ruling came as the result of a lawsuit filed on March 16 by 
2 Live Crew in which the group sought to have the "Nasty" album declared not 
obscene and to enjoin Broward County Sheriff Navarro from arresting merchants 
who sold it to adults. The album, which 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell 
considers to be in the comedy tradition of Redd Foxx and Eddie Murphy and is 
laced with graphic sexual references, comes with an imprinted parental advisory 
warning that it contains "explicit language." 
</P>
<P>
According to UCLA's Brenner, the judge states that police officers cannot use 
the type of tactics reportedly being employed to pressure retailers in various 
communities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"What he is saying is that authorities must first go into court, have a hearing 
and get a judge or jury, based on local community standards, to determine that 
the record is obscene." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Risher -- a San Antonio merchant who has defied attempts by local 
authorities to pressure him to voluntarily remove the "Nasty" album from his 
store -- accuses local police of intimidating retailers with the weight of a 
federal obscenity decision while employing law-enforcement tactics specifically 
rebuked by the judge who wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander of the San Antonio vice squad and the officer 
handling the matter for the city, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like some sort of ill-defined threat that they're waving like a club 
over our heads," Risher, owner of Hogwild Records, told The Times on Tuesday. 
"I go to work each day wondering if I'm going to get hit over the head with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, the Sacramento district attorney's office said it did not 
find "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to be obscene as judged against "a 
contemporary statewide standard." Also, a lieutenant in the vice squad of the 
Dallas City Police told The Times that authorities had no intention of 
prosecuting merchants for selling the "Nasty" album in Dallas and that media 
reports to the contrary were unfounded.

PAPER TO RAIN ON PARADE -- THIS TIME FOR MANDELA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A paper blizzard will fall from the high-rise buildings that line lower 
Broadway today when Nelson Mandela receives the greeting that New York City 
reserves for its special heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Such greetings can be traced to the welcome for the Marquis de Lafayette, the 
French hero of the American Revolution, when he returned for a visit to the 
former colonies in 1824. One hitch: There were no high-rise canyons or ticker 
tape, so Lafayette had to settle for cheering crowds. 
</P>
<P>
The first paper shower, said to be spontaneous and still lacking ticker tape, 
was bestowed on President Theodore Roosevelt in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
In 1919, ticker tape became a part of the tradition, pouring down on the Prince 
of Wales. The idea was credited to New York's official greeter, Grover Whalen, 
who wanted to stir up enthusiasm for the visitor. At the time, New York's Irish 
population wasn't feeling very hospitable toward British royalty because 
British troops were occupying Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply started a word-of-mouth campaign and the (ticker-tape) idea filtered 
through the thousands of offices that line the canyon," Whalen said. "The 
workers also tore up phone books, waste paper, any kind of tinsel, and made the 
confetti snowstorm." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, thousands of tons of torn paper have drifted down on hundreds of 
noteworthy people, celebrating the end of World War II and heroic feats on 
land, sea and in the air and beyond. Recipients of the tribute ranged from the 
"Lone Eagle," Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, in 1927 to war heroes to astronauts to 
baseball and Olympic champions and, in 1985, to Vietnam War veterans. Among 
numerous notables who have received the confetti greeting were Gens. Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle in 1945, Winston Churchill in 1946, Queen 
Elizabeth in 1957, astronaut John Glenn in 1962, the "Miracle Mets" World 
Series champs in 1969, Pope John Paul II in 1979 and U.S. hostages freed from 
Iran in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
City sanitation officials say the most paper ever tossed onto a motorcade 
floated down on Glenn -- a total of 3,474 tons. 
</P>
<P>
That record seems virtually impossible to match because many new office 
buildings have sealed windows. And ticker tape is vanishing, too. The blizzard 
that greets Nelson Mandela will more likely be made of shredded computer 
printouts and torn up telephone books.

LENTIL FARMERS FIGHT TO KEEP VITAL SERVICE; 
</P>

UNION PACIFIC CALLS WASHINGTON ROUTES UNPROFITABLE. GROWERS SEE HIGHER SHIPPING 
COSTS IF LINES ARE SHUT.

<TEXT>
<P>
At first blush, these are boom times on the Palouse for farmers and the 
railroad that carries their peas and lentils to market. 
</P>
<P>
Washington-grown lentils in 1989 filled 308 freight cars bound for foreign 
export -- a 51% increase over 1988 crops. This year, Union Pacific Railroad Co. 
and commodity shippers agree that at least 331 rail cars will be needed to 
carry the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific, which posted a $547-million profit in 1989, can't keep up with 
the demand for rail cars. And the railroad's chief competitors here, barge 
haulers and truckers, are facing higher river fees and gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, does Union Pacific want to abandon 69 miles of track on the Palouse, 
Washington's agricultural southeast corner where the rolling hills, come 
harvest, are crested with golden waves of grain? 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and shippers, pushing back their sweat-stained caps to scratch their 
heads, are puzzled and fearful. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't wash," said Dan Bruce, president of BNP Lentil of Farmington, the 
largest of a dozen shippers on the two lines Union Pacific wants to abandon. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: In May, Union Pacific and opponents of the plan aired their 
arguments in a public hearing before an Interstate Commerce Commission 
administrative judge in Pullman. Whatever the judge's decision, expected in 
July, it is likely to be appealed to the five-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
The railroads abandoned 29,127 miles of track across America between 1980 and 
1988, including about 1,400 rail miles in Washington, according to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. Much of the track consisted of short-haul branch 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
When the railroad pulls out, shipping costs usually rise as farmers are forced 
to turn to trucking. Here, it could be the death knell. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher transportation costs associated with long-haul trucking of peas and 
lentils from this part of the country would price local producers and shippers 
out of business," said Wesley Kriebel, a USDA analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of rail service erodes both economic and social life in rural communities. 
For instance, some feel that The Frying Pan, a homey cafe in Farmington a few 
hundred yards from the track, is threatened. Lack of a railroad also puts added 
stress on deteriorating rural roads and bridges, critics of the railroad say. 
</P>
<P>
Without access to rail shipping, "the town may blow away," farmer Steve Appel 
of Endicott, Wash., said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: In southeast Washington, Union Pacific is up against more than the 
usual predictions of gloom and doom down on the farm. The 300 farmers affected 
by the proposed abandonment are represented by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley; 
and their U.S. senator, Brock Adams, was secretary of transportation in the 
Jimmy Carter Administration. Both Democrats oppose the rail service cutback. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific executives say that the Tekoa and Pleasant Valley lines will lose 
more than $102,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Peas and lentils are not enough," railroad spokesman John Bromley said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the farmers and shippers and their Chicago lawyer insist that the 
railroad's strategy is to run the lines in the red to justify abandoning them. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning Union Pacific witnesses at the hearing, the attorney, Thomas 
McFarland, established that, although the railroad canceled Saturday runs in 
1989, three-man crews still were routinely paid $340 a day for those runs. And 
the railroad frequently uses two locomotives when only one is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Bromley said that the railroad has been hurt in recent years because it lost 
its wheat business to barges on the Snake and Columbia rivers. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland said the shift to water transport was precipitated two years ago, 
when Union Pacific raised its rates for hauling wheat. 
</P>
<P>
Denver Tolliver, a North Dakota economist who testified for the pea and lentil 
growers, calculated that the two lines would produce a $41,000 annual profit if 
management and accounting practices were altered. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations and issues raised in the Palouse abandonment are similar to 
those aired in Idaho. Union Pacific last year received ICC approval to abandon 
track servicing 200 farmers in that state's Teton Valley. 
</P>
<P>
FEELING SQUEEZED: Farmers like Burt Phillips, who grows barley and wheat on 
1,400 acres in Tetonia, said that they are feeling the pinch of higher trucking 
rates. Phillips said that trucking his grain to a distant railhead now costs 
him $5,000 more a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Countries like Brazil, they can't get their commodities to market because they 
don't have the infrastructure," Phillips said. "We've got . . . the railroads, 
and we're tearing them down. It just doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific's Bromley said of the railroad's detractors: 
</P>
<P>
"They're looking for a villain, and that's human nature. We're not in business 
to go out of business. We're in business to make a profit."

Five European Community nations on Tuesday signed an accord that will end 
border checks for their nationals, apply a joint visa and asylum policy and 
share data on illegal aliens, suspected criminals and missing persons. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited accord between Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France 
and West Germany was hailed as an example for a no-borders pact among all 12 
European Community nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our agreement is a model . . . for the free movement of people in the 
community," Dutch Deputy Foreign Minister Piet Dankert told reporters on behalf 
of the signatory nations. 
</P>
<P>
The five-nation pact will be extended to include East Germany after its 
expected merger this year with the Federal Republic, making it the first 
international treaty viewing East and West Germany as a single entity. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are to open this week with Italy, which wants to join the Schengen 
accord, named for this village on the Luxembourg-German-French border where it 
was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, in the works since 1985, must be ratified by the national 
parliaments to take effect. Ratification may take two years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the five signatory nations will: 
</P>
<P>
Remove internal border checks for their citizens and legal residents and let 
legally admitted people from outside the five nations move within their 
boundaries for three months without a visa. 
</P>
<P>
Apply a joint policy to prevent "asylum shopping," whereby refugees go from one 
nation to the next to get residency visas. 
</P>
<P>
Intensify cooperation between police and justice officials and allow police to 
chase suspected criminals across national boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Simplify extradition procedures and harmonize gun-control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Share information on people wanted or missing or who are considered dangerous. 
Such a data bank will also keep tabs on such items as stolen cars and 
passports.

AID FOR 2 MILLION CHERNOBYL VICTIMS ASKED

A Soviet republic Tuesday asked for international help to relocate and give 
medical aid to more than 2 million people, including 600,000 children, affected 
by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden plea -- more than four years after the accident -- comes after 
Soviet scientists acknowledged that the situation is much worse than Moscow had 
portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the republic of Byelorussia's more than 10 million people have to 
be moved from areas contaminated by radiation, said Victor Borovikov, a 
Byelorussia diplomat. He said this includes 27 cities and more than 2,600 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no energy, no transportation, no communications" in these regions, he 
told reporters. He was in Brussels for the departure today of a truck convoy 
carrying donated children's medicine to Minsk, the republic's capital. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that thousands were moved after the April 26, 1986, accident in the 
Ukraine. But he added: "Then Moscow said there was no panic, no danger. In the 
past four years, we've realized the situation was not so simple." 
</P>
<P>
Byelorussia, which has no nuclear power plants, got 70% of the fallout from the 
nuclear power plant at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
He said the republic had planned to spend $14 billion to move 180,000 people 
from the high-radiation zone by the end of 1995 but would now try to do it by 
the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet scientists recommend that all people in all the contaminated areas be 
evacuated at an estimated cost of $70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Borovikov said experts now say it could take up to 200 years "to totally wipe 
out" effects of the accident in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no experience in this field, which is why we're asking for 
international help," said Borovikov, the republic's U.N. ambassador in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Borovikov said that after the accident, people were paid by the Soviet 
authorities to stay in the contaminated zones, but they are now demanding 
immediate relocation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Human error was blamed in the blast at Chernobyl, 60 miles north of Kiev, in 
the early morning hours of April 26, 1986. First word of the disaster came from 
Finland and Scandinavia, where high radiation levels were detected. The Soviets 
did not acknowledge that a nuclear disaster had occurred until April 28. About 
135,000 people were evacuated, Soviet officials reported. Hundreds of people 
were treated for severe cases of radiation illness; 18,000 more were briefly 
hospitalized. The death toll at Chernobyl was 31.

BUSH BUDGET PLAN EXPECTED BY DEMOCRATS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: NEGOTIATORS SAY A MOVE TODAY BY THE ADMINISTRATION COULD MAKE OR BREAK 
THE EFFORT TO REDUCE RED INK.

<P>
Democratic participants in budget talks said Tuesday that they expect the Bush 
Administration to make a new proposal today that could make or break the 
5-week-old effort to reach bipartisan agreement on a deficit reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
It then should be possible to tell whether an accord can be reached by the end 
of the month, several participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the meetings between White House and congressional leaders have 
amounted to on-the-job training in budget-making and possible ways to cut as 
much as $50 billion from the deficit expected for the year starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
With the negotiating phase at hand, however, Democratic lawmakers said they 
assumed that the next step would be for Budget Director Richard G. Darman to 
put forward an offer to get the bargaining process moving. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand and hope we'll have a proposal from the President," said Sen. 
Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) after Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) predicted that 
serious negotiations would begin this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee 
and a key participant in the meetings, said a Darman proposal would have to 
reflect the serious nature of the fiscal crisis facing the country. 
</P>
<P>
Today will mark "a critical moment -- what happens in that session will tell us 
an awful lot about whether we engage in frank negotiations or there is going to 
be a breakdown," Panetta told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for the Administration to provide a starting point," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, House advocates of a balanced budget amendment to the 
Constitution claimed success in their drive to force a House vote on the 
proposal to bar deficit spending unless it is approved by 60% majorities in the 
House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, bottled up for years in the House Judiciary Committee, was 
pried loose with the aid of a rarely used procedure known as a discharge 
petition. It requires the signatures of 218 members -- a bare majority of the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most significant event in Congress this year," said Rep. C. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a leader in the effort to collect the 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
A showdown on the Bush-backed constitutional change is expected sometime in 
July. A similar amendment was approved last week by the Senate Judiciary 
Committee on an 11-3 vote, and both sides said they expect a close vote when it 
comes to the Senate floor later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds majority approval in both 
chambers and must be ratified by 38 states before they take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Although this is a stringent requirement, proponents of the balanced budget 
amendment said chances of approval this year are better than ever.

LAW: THE DEFENSE SAYS PROSECUTORS FAILED TO PROVE THE FRAUD AND RACKETEERING 
CHARGES. THE JUDGE EXPECTS JURY DELIBERATIONS TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK.

Attorneys for Imelda Marcos announced that they would not call witnesses in her 
defense after federal prosecutors rested their fraud and racketeering case 
against the former Philippine first lady Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With no defense case for either Marcos or co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi, the 
stage is set for jury deliberations to begin next week after final arguments by 
all sides. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Marcos' lawyers was a surprise to some. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Gerry Spence had told jurors in April during his opening 
statement that he would present evidence that the CIA and the White House knew 
about and encouraged her late husband, former dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, to 
stash funds overseas and make other secret investments in U.S. real estate. 
</P>
<P>
No such evidence was introduced during the government's case, however, making 
it unlikely it can be argued in final statements next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our view that the government failed to make its case," Spence said. "You 
only call witnesses when you have a case to rebut." 
</P>
<P>
After the jury was dismissed for the rest of the week, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Charles LaBella shook hands with some of the defense lawyers, but he would not 
comment about the case. 
</P>
<P>
A number of legal arguments remain to be resolved, but closing arguments were 
scheduled for the first three days of next week. U.S. District Judge John 
Keenan told jurors they could expect to be deliberating before the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The 95th and final witness -- attorney Jeffrey Greenbaum, representing the 
Philippine government in a civil lawsuit -- testified earlier Tuesday that 
Khashoggi had tried to negotiate a settlement with Manila in 1987 that would 
have had the government of Corazon Aquino pay the Saudi financier more than $15 
million. In return, Khashoggi would have turned over New York buildings and art 
that the Philippines claims had been stolen by the Marcoses. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi is accused of fraud and obstructing justice in helping the Marcoses 
try to dispose of art and property. A court order forbidding sale or transfer 
of Marcos properties in the United States had been issued a few days after the 
dictator's 20-year rule ended in a revolution early in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The government's case against Imelda Marcos focused on allegations of fraud 
that began with bribes, kickbacks, embezzlement and coercion during her 
husband's regime, the proceeds from which were exported to the United States. 
Prosecutors said the violations began while the Marcoses were in power and 
continued after they fled to exile in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Conviction on the racketeering charges would make much of Imelda Marcos' assets 
subject to forfeiture. The Justice Department has said funds seized from her 
would be returned to the victims of the alleged fraud, the Philippine 
government and two U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, she also faces up to 20 years in jail on each of two racketeering 
counts and five years each on fraud and obstruction of justice charges. 
Khashoggi, charged with two counts of fraud and obstruction of justice, faces 
up to five years in prison.

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a small-town bank allegedly holding a cache 
of stolen medieval art to open its vault to an inventory by the East German 
cathedral that claims the treasure. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ordered also that the time and place of 
the inspection be kept secret to protect the inspectors and the objects. The 
works are believed to have been hidden in a German mine shaft and taken by a 
U.S. soldier from Texas at the end of World War II.

The top Democratic leadership in the House and Senate are opposed to the 
amendment because it is seen as weakening the First Amendment, but a vote 
against it is viewed by Democrats and Republicans alike as risky business in an 
election year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Judiciary subcommittee cleared the amendment, but only by a 5-3 
vote that carried a recommendation against floor passage. The full Judiciary 
Committee voted Tuesday to move the amendment to the House floor but took no 
stand for or against passage. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Democratic opponents failed to get an adverse recommendation 
and supporters failed to get a favorable one.

BARBARA CASON; VETERAN OF TV, STAGE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Cason, known most recently as the comic actress who played Gary 
Shandling's mother on the offbeat "It's Gary Shandling's Show" on the Fox 
television network, has died of apparent heart failure, her friend and 
publicist said Tuesday. She was 61. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Frank said she died Monday in her Hollywood Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of stage and television work, she also was seen on TV from 1977 to 
1979 as Cloris Phebus, the man-hungry policewoman in the comedy "Carter 
Country." She had been a regular on the 1970 summer series "Comedy Tonight," a 
spoof of standard television programming, and as the proper Miss Tillis of the 
hospital accounting department in the medical satire "New Temperatures Rising" 
from 1973 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Cason graduated from the University of Mississippi with bachelor's and master's 
degrees in theater arts. After graduation, she returned to her hometown of 
Memphis, Tenn., where she co-founded the Front Street Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to New York in the early 1960s to appear in "Plaza 9 Revue" at the 
Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
During the next 10 years, Cason was cast in a number of Broadway and 
off-Broadway productions, including "Marat Sade," "Oh, Coward!" and "Firebugs," 
for which she received an Obie (off-Broadway) award nomination. In 1973, she 
appeared locally in "Oh, Coward!" at the Ivar Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Cason's feature film credits included "Cold Turkey" and "Heretic II." 
</P>
<P>
Frank said her final stage role was last year in the Los Angeles production of 
"Beyond Therapy." The Shandling show made its final broadcast earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Cason is survived by her husband of 20 years, actor Dennis Patrick, who asks 
that donations be made to the American Heart Assn. at St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center in Santa Monica.

SACRAMENTO FILE: SHOWDOWN VOTE ON ALCOHOL TAX BOOST SET IN ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With backing from the liquor lobby, the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee 
has forwarded to the lower house floor for a showdown vote a proposed 
constitutional amendment to impose a $230-million tax increase on alcoholic 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation (ACA 38) was launched by liquor interests to fend off a more 
drastic "nickel a drink" initiative that would raise liquor taxes by $830 
million. The industry seeks to persuade voters to adopt the more modest alcohol 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), the industry-backed 
measure requires a two-thirds vote to win a spot on the November general 
election ballot. It previously passed the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretary of state's office said Tuesday that the tax initiative 
has qualified for the November ballot, with more than 1 million signatures of 
registered voters submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Under the liquor lobby's plan, the per-gallon tax would increase from 1 cent to 
20 cents on table wine; from 4 cents to 20 cents on beer, and from $2 to $3.30 
on hard liquor. By contrast, the "nickel a drink" initiative would raise the 
tax per gallon to $1.29 on wine, 57 cents on beer, and $8.40 on hard liquor. 
</P>
<P>

STATE BUDGET: COUNTY OFFICIALS AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS SEEK TO PREVENT CUTS IN 
WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS AN ALREADY CRIPPLED SYSTEM. THEY MAKE THEIR APPEAL TO THE 
GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATORS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With final deliberations on a new state budget about to begin, county officials 
and health-care providers began an intensive lobbying campaign Tuesday designed 
to stave off cuts in what they call an already crippled health delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference at the Capitol, health officials urged Gov. George 
Deukmejian and the Legislature to consider a tax increase, rather than program 
cuts, to close a $3.6-billion revenue gap. 
</P>
<P>
The press conference marked a stepped-up lobbying campaign by groups 
representing a wide variety of people depending on the public health system, 
from AIDS patients to the severely disabled. An annual ritual, the lobbying 
campaign will last from now until the governor and Legislature agree on a 
budget. A two-house budget conference committee will begin deliberations today 
on rival versions of a $56-billion budget prepared by the Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
With tax collections in the new budget year expected to run about $3.6 billion 
below what it will take to finance state services at present levels, the 
governor and lawmakers are debating whether to use budget cuts or tax 
increases, or a combination of the two, to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gail Anderson, an emergency room physician at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center, said waiting lists at emergency rooms now are commonplace and 
warned that any further cuts in state funds will be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
"We already are in trouble. . . . If we are cut any further we are going to 
have to close down, we are going to have to close our doors," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a proposal by Deukmejian to cut $150 million in county health funds, 
health officials said counties would be forced to reduce scores of local 
services. 
</P>
<P>
They predicted that clinics would be closed and that services in jails, 
children's hospitals and alcohol and drug abuse programs would be reduced. Some 
counties would have to cut back on ambulance services, others would be forced 
to eliminate or reduce programs for AIDS, nutrition, family services and 
suicide intervention, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a survival mode right now," said Dan Weisburd, president of the 
California Alliance for the Mentally Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Yolo County Supervisor Betsy Marchand, speaking for the County Supervisors 
Assn. of California, said she and the others "support a tax increase," but did 
not specify which taxes they would support raising. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing at the news conference was Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San 
Jose), chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, who earlier in the 
day unveiled sketchy details of a budget-balancing plan that would raise $2 
billion through tax increases and by speeding up tax collections. Most of the 
money in the plan would be generated by raising the top rate of the personal 
income tax from 9.3% to 11% for individual taxpayers earning $100,000 a year 
and couples with taxable income of $200,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) -- a member of 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's inner circle -- proposed a budget-balancing 
plan that would close the $3.6-billion gap by using a combination of budget 
cuts, new taxes and adjustments in the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would freeze cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients and the 
aged, blind and disabled while also suspending indexing -- the law that 
prevents taxpayers from being bumped into higher tax brackets when they get pay 
raises equal to the increase in the cost of living. The proposal also would 
strictly conform California's tax laws to the federal code, repeal the sales 
tax exemption on candy and raise alcohol taxes.

NEW ROTATION DOESN'T BOTHER VALENZUELA, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Showing no ill effects from moving up a day in the new four-man rotation, 
Fernando Valenzuela pitched seven strong innings and the Dodgers took advantage 
of an inept Houston Astro defense for a 5-1 victory Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before a Cap Night crowd of 45,054 at Dodger Stadium, Valenzuela evened his 
record at 5-5 and handed the Astros their 11th consecutive road loss. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came at the expense of Mike Scott, who fell to 4-7 despite giving 
up only one earned run. The Dodgers scored four times on only one hit in the 
fourth to give Valenzuela all the runs he needed against the Astros' weak 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela had problems with his control in the first two innings, giving up 
only a single but walking three and having to contend with two baserunners in 
each inning. He stranded a man at third in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
But he found his groove in the third inning and retired 10 consecutive batters, 
striking out four of them. 
</P>
<P>
Scott matched Valenzuela for three innings but was victimized by his defense 
and his own control problems in the fourth. AlexTrevino, playing his first game 
this season at first base in place of ailing Glenn Davis, couldn't handle Kal 
Daniels' grounder to open the inning and was given an error. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray followed with a single, and with one out and the runners moving, 
Mike Scioscia grounded to shortstop Eric Yelding -- who tried to tag second but 
was beaten by Murray, loading the bases. Scott walked Mike Sharperson on four 
pitches, forcing in the first run. Alfredo Griffin followed with a run-scoring 
fly to medium center, and when the throw home wasn't cut off, the runners 
advanced to second and third. 
</P>
<P>
That cost the Astros two more runs when Yelding threw Valenzuela's grounder 
into the dirt for the second error of the inning. All four runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Murray produced the Dodgers' fifth run, hitting a two-out home run deep into 
the right-field bullpen in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's shutout ended in the seventh when Casey Candaele hit a one-out 
homer -- his third this season and second off Valenzuela this year. Valenzuela 
also gave up two subsequent singles, but left the runners on base by striking 
out pinch-hitter Dave Rohde. 
</P>
<P>
With a four-run lead and 110 pitches thrown, Valenzuela was given the rest of 
the night off, with Tim Crews and Jim Gott pitching a scoreless inning each. 
Valenzuela said he would have continued if Candaele hadn't homered. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was pitching on three days' rest for the first time, he said, since 
1986 or '87. "It's been a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said Valenzuela "said he could do it. We'll see how 
it works." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez will also pitch on three days' rest tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to see a difference the first start or second start," catcher 
Mike Scioscia said. "But if you keep someone on three days' rest for a long 
period of time, it's going to take its toll. (Valenzuela) has been very 
consistent lately. We're looking for six to eight strong innings from him start 
after start, and that's what we've been getting." 
</P>
<P>
The Astros have been equally consistent -- losing their 11th consecutive road 
game and falling to 9-24 away from home, the worst record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any answers," Scott said. "We had one good stretch but . . . 
we're having a hard time winning games." 
</P>
<P>
Said Astro Manager Art Howe: "This whole road trip we haven't been able to come 
up with the big hit. I thought (Valenzuela) was ripe to be had." 
</P>
<P>
The victory, the Dodgers' third in a row, pulled them to within a game of .500 
and kept them within a game of third-place San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
After grounding out in the fifth inning, Kal Daniels left the game because of 
discomfort in his left hamstring. Daniels was to be examined today. . . . 
Outfielder Stan Javier has hits in eight consecutive games and he has increased 
his average to .309. During that streak Javier has hit .435 and scored eight 
runs. The switch hitter is batting .368 right-handed and figures to continue 
seeing playing time because of the injury to Kirk Gibson. . . . Fernando 
Valenzuela came into Tuesday's game hitting .400 with a home run, six runs 
batted in and a pinch-hit double. He has at least one hit in seven of 13 
starts. . . . The Dodgers entered Tuesday's game without anyone in the NL's top 
10 in any offensive category except stolen bases -- where Juan Samuel is tied 
for second with 24, but he has been benched since Friday. . . . The Dodger 
bullpen, which has a 7-10 record and 4.08 earned-run average for the season, 
has given up only three runs in the last 19 innings, a 1.40 ERA. . . . Jim 
Gott, who struck out two in a pressure situation Monday, said he felt 
"fantastic" the day after. "I'm ready (to pitch) every night now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros have had their own injury problems. National League home run leader 
Glenn Davis was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game Tuesday 
because of a sore lower back. Rookie Eric Anthony, who has been limited to 
pinch-hitting because of a hamstring injury, was examined by Dr. Frank Jobe 
Tuesday and pronounced sound. Anthony, who last month became only the second 
Houston player to hit a home run into the upper deck of the Astrodome, said he 
expects to return to the lineup today. And infielder Ken Oberkfell, who left 
the field Monday because of a rib cage strain, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list. The Astros recalled Dave Rohde from triple-A Tucson in his 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' rookie league teams, Great Falls (Mont.) and Kissimmee (Fla.), 
begin play today. The Great Falls roster includes No. 1 draft choice, pitcher 
Ronnie Walden, as well as twins Mike and Mark Mimbs, both left-handed pitchers, 
and pitcher Pedro Martinez, 19-year-old brother of Ramon Martinez. The younger 
Martinez is scheduled to pitch today's opener at home against Medicine Hat.

Orel Hershiser was back in uniform Monday night at Dodger Stadium. No, his 
rehabilitation isn't a year ahead of schedule. He was merely filming a public 
service spot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
As has become his custom, Hershiser worked out for two hours before watching an 
inning of the Dodger-Houston game and going home. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lifting weights," he said. "I've had only one bad day -- I worked too 
hard. Everything else has been positive. I'm not running or doing other kinds 
of exercise because I don't want the rest of my body to be too far ahead of my 
arm in the rehab process." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't mention the T word -- timetable -- to the 1988 Cy Young Award winner, who 
underwent shoulder surgery April 27. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The whole rehab process is based on patience," he said. "What would ruin that 
patience is a timetable." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser went on the last Dodger trip, and trainer Pat Screnar wants him to 
continue to accompany the team so his progress can be monitored. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the clubhouse in Houston last week, Long Beach reporter Gordon Verrell asked 
Hershiser if he could throw a baseball. The pitcher picked one up and flung it 
off a wall 30 feet away. Better velocity than Mike Maddux showed against the 
Astros that night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another Dodger who might have to undergo surgery is Tom Lasorda. Dr. Frank Jobe 
thinks it will be necessary to repair damaged cartilage in the manager's right 
knee after the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cartilage," Lasorda said. "It's bone against bone. All that 
batting practice I've pitched and all that running I've done." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said he can't run and can hardly walk, but Monday afternoon he swam 100 
laps in the Olympic-sized swimming pool at the Los Angeles Police Academy 
behind Dodger Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was some of the most rigorous exercise Lasorda has done since May 30, 1948. 
That was the night he pitched all 15 innings in the Schenectady Blue Jays' 6-5 
victory over the Amsterdam Rugmakers. According to an article in the 
Schenectady Gazette that was on his desk Monday, he singled home the winning 
run and struck out a Canadian-American League-record 25 batters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Canadian-American League," scoffed coach Bill Russell. "Terrible league." . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most logical intentional walk will be booed by the home crowd. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Quite a home run race the St. Louis Cardinals and Cecil Fielder are having. . .

There should be no complaints from the Sunday Silence camp about the 126 pounds 
he has been assigned for the $1-million Gold Cup Sunday at Hollywood Park. Ack

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
RED SOX PULL TO WITHIN ONE GAME OF BLUE JAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Blue Jays returned to Toronto after a 9-1 trip, the best in the team's 
history, feeling they were ready to break open the race in the American League 
East. 
</P>
<P>
But the Boston Red Sox, behind rookie pitcher Dana Kiecker, beat the Blue Jays, 
4-2, and moved to within a game of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Kiecker gave up only three hits and two unearned runs in 8 1/3 innings. But the 
unearned runs meant the Red Sox had to win it in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 2-2, Toronto relief pitcher Duane Ward walked Dwight Evans to 
open the ninth. Ellis Burks hit a triple to center field past a diving Mookie 
Wilson to break the tie, and Burks scored on an infield out by Tony Pena as the 
Red Sox won their 12th in the last 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Murphy relieved Kiecker and struck out the last two Blue Jays, Fred McGriff 
and John Olerud. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I learned a few things in seven years in the minors, " Kiecker (2-3) 
said. "But I would have enjoyed pitching a complete game. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good fastball and when I retired 15 in a row I thought I could do it. 
The big thing is, we won." 
</P>
<P>
In his last three starts, Kiecker, 29, has pitched 20 1/3 innings and has not 
given up more than one hit in any of those innings. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a giant win," Murphy said. "Every win is a big one, but now we're 
only one game back of Toronto instead of three. I had my mechanics going for 
me. All of a sudden the strikes were coming and the outs followed." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 7, Oakland 6 -- Perhaps his knee was bothering him, because it was not 
the Dave Stewart the Athletics have come to rely on who took the mound at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (9-5) gave up a three-run home run to Alan Trammell in the first inning 
and the Tigers scored seven runs against him in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, six runs is easily enough for Stewart, who is trying to become a 
20-game winner for the fourth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
The Hendersons, Dave and Rickey, hit home runs, but Paul Gibson and Mike 
Henneman stopped them for the last 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have won six of their last seven games and are only 5 1/2 games out 
of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second game in a row in which Trammell hit a three-run home run in 
the first inning. The Athletics gave an intentional pass to Trammell to load 
the bases in the fourth, but Cecil Fielder singled in two runs, and the Tigers 
were in front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to try to set up the double play," Manager Tony LaRussa of the 
Athletics said. "We thought Fielder might hit it on the ground. He did, but not 
at anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Baltimore 4 -- Light-hitting Felix Fermin doubled off relief ace 
Gregg Olson and scored the winning run in the ninth at Cleveland on Sandy 
Alomar's single. 
</P>
<P>
Fermin, who is batting .217, had had only seven extra-base hits in 138 previous 
at-bats. The double was only the third extra-base hit off Olson this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians have won four in a row and the Orioles have lost six of their last 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Minnesota 4 -- Pete Incaviglia hit a 411-foot home run in the seventh 
inning at Arlington, Tex., to hand the Twins their 11th loss in the last 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia's 11th home run made a winner of Brad Arnsberg, who pitched a 
hitless inning. Kenny Rogers earned his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins had scored two runs in the top of the seventh to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 2, Seattle 1 -- Kevin Seitzer tripled home the winning run at 
Kansas City and the Mariners stranded 12 baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals used five pitchers, with Steve Farr (5-3) going the first five. 
</P>
<P>
Seitzer's triple scored Frank White, who had singled to make the score 2-0 in 
the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners loaded the bases in the seventh with two outs, but second baseman 
White robbed Pete O'Brien of a hit to retire the side. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Milwaukee 1 -- The punchless Yankees built a four-run lead for only 
the third time in their last 23 games and won at Milwaukee. There were two rain 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Cary (4-2) gave up five hits but no runs in six innings, leaving the game 
after the first rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Hall hit a two-run home run for the Yankees, who ended a four-game losing 
streak. The Yankees have won only five of their last 23; the Brewers have won 
only eight of their last 27. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MAGADAN HITTING FOR THE METS -- WHEN HE PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dave Magadan situation is reminiscent of a similar situation the New York 
Mets faced with Howard Johnson a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were reluctant to give Johnson a regular job. He could play in the 
infield and outfield, but the Mets felt he would not do well as an everyday 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries forced them to give Johnson full-time duty in 1987. In the next three 
seasons, he was the most consistent player on the team and hit 96 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is the hottest hitter on the club, the Mets are reluctant to give 
Magadan, also a versatile player, regular status. It can only be a matter of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan had two hits and drove in two runs Tuesday night at New York as the 
Mets, behind David Cone's four-hitter, beat St. Louis, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds, Orlando Mercaado and Johnson hit home runs for the Mets, who 
have won nine of 11 and moved to within five games of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm forced to look at the lineup card every day. I've not been told I'm a 
regular," Magadan said. "I have hit safely in nine games and reached a high 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"Just two weeks ago, I hit the low point. Mike (Marshall) was hurt. I wasn't in 
the lineup. Tom O'Malley was at first." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Bud Harrelson would not say that Magadan was in the lineup to stay. 
"We're flexible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cone, who had a no-hitter in his last start wiped out because of rain after 3 
2/3 innings, was in the rain again. "I can't worry about what I can't control," 
he said. "I just kept pitching." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, San Francisco 3 -- Clutch relief pitching by former Giant Craig 
Lefferts put an end to the Giants' nine-game winning streak in this game at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts got Will Clark with the bases loaded on a fly ball in the seventh, 
then in the ninth, disposed of Kevin Mitchell with the potential tying and 
winning run on base on a popup to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter of the Giants set a National League record when he caught his 
1,862nd game. The old record was held by Al Lopez over 18 seasons. Carter is in 
his 16th. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Don Robinson of the Giants hit a pinch-homer with the bases empty in 
the fifth inning. It was the 12th homer of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, Pittsburgh 1 -- Dickie Thon singled to left field with two out 
in the 10th inning at Philadelphia to score John Kruk from second with the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Kruk, who drove in the first run, singled and reached second on a hit by Randy 
Ready. Bill Landrum was the losing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 4-0, Atlanta 2-3 -- Charlie Leibrandt, who started his major league 
career more than a decade ago with the Reds, put a halt to their six-game 
winning streak in the second game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
With Chris Sabo hitting a home run and Glenn Braggs driving in the go-ahead 
run, the Reds rallied for three runs in the ninth inning to win the opener. 
</P>
<P>
But Leibrandt, in his fourth start since coming off the disabled list June 2, 
was superb in the second game. He held the leaders of the West to six hits. It 
was his second complete game and his first shutout in more than 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves beat former teammate Rick Mahler, getting a two-run jump in the 
first inning. First baseman Todd Benzinger's error started the attack. Jim 
Presley homered in the eighth for the other run. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves led, 2-1, until Sabo homered with one out in the ninth inning. Eric 
Davis walked, stole second and scored the winning run on Braggs' single. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Montreal 1 -- Spike Owen set a league record for a shortstop by 
handling his only chance at Montreal. The Expo shortstop has gone 61 games 
without an error. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the league's best young pitchers hooked up, with the Cubs' Shawn Boskie 
getting edge over Mark Gardner. Boskie had a no-hitter until one was out in the 
fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg walked in the fourth, stole second and scored on Andre Dawson's 
single, the first hit off Gardner. Sandberg hit his 19th home run in the ninth, 
and it turned out to be a needed run. DAN HAFNER

<P>
Kirk Gibson, who suffered a strained groin muscle while running out a single 
Monday, was out of the lineup Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson was examined Tuesday by Dr. Ralph Gambardella, who confirmed the strain. 
</P>
<P>
The playing status of Gibson, who has appeared in only 14 games this season 
after returning from hamstring surgery, is day to day. The Dodgers will be off 
Thursday and play in Cincinnati Friday.

FUNDS DRYING UP ALONG WITH LAND; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: ALONG WITH A LACK OF WATER, DFG OFFICIALS MUST COPE WITH CUTBACKS IN 
STATE-SUPPORTED PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A significant number of the state's fish and wildlife are doomed because 
fisheries and habitats are drying up about as fast as the funds required to 
manage them, Pete Bontadelli, director of the Department of Fish and Game, told 
an Assembly committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While the crises are not necessarily related, Bontadelli said: "Without a 
strong revenue base, we are hard-pressed to respond to the contingencies 
necessary to deal with the drought, and it will take us some time to facilitate 
recovery of fish and wildlife populations once the drought is over. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The natural production of game and non-game fish is way down. It will 
be several years before our lakes, reservoirs, rivers and streams recover." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidental with Bontadelli's report to the Water, Parks and Wildlife 
Committee on the impact of the four-year, statewide drought was the disclosure 
that an Assembly budget committee is proposing to slash $12.6 million from Fish 
and Game programs to cover a projected budget shortfall of that amount in the 
fiscal year starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The funds would come from the department's Preservation Fund of non-dedicated 
fishing and hunting license revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would hit the following programs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wildlife management, down from $6.4 million to $1.4 million, making it 
difficult, if not impossible, to compile the environmental data required to 
justify traditional hunting programs -- and raising the possibility that some 
hunts would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marine resources, down from $7.3 million to $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inland fisheries, down from $14.3 million to $12.5 million, forcing the 
closure of the Mojave and Imperial Valley hatcheries, the latter being the only 
catfish hatchery in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Law enforcement, down from $25 million to $24 million, eliminating the 
special operations unit that targets poachers. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate proposes augmenting the cuts with $12.6 million from the state's 
general fund to help pay for game wardens -- about half of the DFG's 
$141-million budget for 1990 -- but Gov. George Deukmejian has indicated that 
he will oppose this. The general fund already has a $3.6-billion shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game, with a $6.9-million deficit in the current fiscal year, also is 
prohibited from using the general fund to assist hunting and sportfishing 
programs, which are supposed to be self-supported by license revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But Bontadelli reminded the committee that license revenues have been dropping 
steadily in recent years, and the decline will be accelerated "as the public 
hears more and more about dry streams and reservoirs, wildlife dieoffs (and) 
dry marshes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three or four of the 13 committee members heard Bontadelli, the others 
having commitments elsewhere. But all were provided with texts of his report, 
and none seemed to have the impression that he was crying wolf. The crises are 
real. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli said deer herds have been hit by blue tongue disease, which is 
associated with the drying up of water holes, and fawn production is down. He 
said wetlands are drying up, coastal streams are severely low or already dry, 
and there was insufficient rain to refill artificial desert water holes -- 
"guzzlers" -- for animals such as bighorn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli praised the help of the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the state 
Department of Water Resources for assistance in mitigating the impact. 
</P>
<P>
But he did allude to a necessity to amend Section 711-C of the Fish and Game 
Code to allow use of the state general fund for hunting and sportfishing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli urged development of a drought contingency plan.

THEY KNOCKED HIS KNEES, BUT COLT HAS PROVED CRITICS WRONG SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The 2-year-old colt Takin On The Cash will take the next step on what has been 
a very rich journey tonight in the trials for the $300,000 Dash For Cash 
Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Felipe Tiscareno and trained by Caesar Dominguez, Takin On The Cash 
has emerged as the dominant 2-year-old on the West Coast after winning the 
Grade I Bay Meadows Futurity and the Grade I Kindergarten and nearly $185,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 fastest qualifiers from tonight's trials will earn a spot in the Dash 
For Cash Futurity finals June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Takin On The Cash was purchased by Tiscareno for $52,000 as a yearling. It was 
Dominguez who picked out Takin On The Cash at the Ruidoso Super Select Sale 
despite the colt's knees, which might have scared off a few potential bidders. 
</P>
<P>
"This colt is buck-kneed," Dominguez said. 'His knees are just a bit crooked. I 
was thinking we may have to go up to $100,000 to buy him, but when I saw his 
knees, I knew we could get him for less. That made me want him even more.' 
</P>
<P>
The worry with many trainers with buck-kneed horses, especially young horses, 
is keeping them sound during the rigors of a 2-year-old racing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, however, did not share those worries about Takin On The Cash. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started out training all I had was cheap horses and when you have 
cheap horses, you have bad-legged horses," said Dominguez, who is in a close 
race with Blane Schvaneveldt for the Los Alamitos summer training title. 
</P>
<P>
"I had plenty of buck-kneed horses and they always seemed to stay sound. I've 
had perfect looking horses who couldn't run a jump. You can't go looking for 
the perfect horse, they just aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
Takin On The Cash has drawn the inside post position in tonight's second 
division of the Dash For Cash Futurity trials. This second of three trials has 
come up easily the toughest of the night with Kindergarten third-place finisher 
Miss Strikin Jet joining Takin On The Cash in the 400-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of the Leo Handicap earlier this summer, Miss Strikin Jet was 
supplemented late into the Dash For Cash trials at a cost of $15,250 to owners 
Mike and Mack Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Strikin Jet was one of two horses to be supplemented into the trials. The 
other was A One Man Band, who will run in the second trial. 
</P>
<P>
The first Sunday afternoon racing program will take place this week, featuring 
the $111,000 Dash For Cash Derby. 
</P>
<P>
The Grade I race was originally scheduled for Saturday night, but rescheduled 
when track officials obtained permission for the afternoon program. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite probably will be the stakes-winning gelding Ourautograph. His 
trainer, Bob Baffert, isn't worried about racing in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be hotter in the afternoon, but that shouldn't bother anyone," Baffert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It really won't make much difference, but I may use it as an excuse if I get 
beat." 
</P>
<P>
A winner of $204,000, Ourautograph is unbeaten in two starts this year, 
including a 21.63-second victory in his 440-yard Dash For Cash Derby trial, 
fastest in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
There is good news and bad news about the Los Alamitos program Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The good news, if you happen to be a music lover, is that there will be another 
prerace concert. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news, if you happen to live next door, is that there is going to be 
another prerace concert. 
</P>

Los Alamitos' management has turned to prerace concerts in an effort to boost 
attendance at the track. Two earlier concerts featuring Michael Martin Murphy 
and Juice Newton were well attended, but they have caused protests by several 
residents of a nearby housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
These residents have met with track officials to express their opposition to 
the live concerts, and when the Desert Rose Band performs Saturday night, there 
will be more than music fans listening. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a company that reports on noise levels posted in the 
housing tract," said Don Galloway, executive vice president of the track. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see how high these levels are so we can do something to satisfy our 
neighbors. We love our neighbors, but we also love these concerts." 
</P>
<P>
The concert is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m.

SUNDAY SILENCE GETS 126 POUNDS FOR GOLD CUP

Sunday Silence has been assigned the high weight of 126 pounds for Sunday's 
$1-million Hollywood Gold Cup, the same weight he carried while winning the 
Californian at Hollywood Park on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other horses weighted for the 1 1/4-mile stake, six are expected to 
start: Criminal Type and Ruhlmann, Sunday Silence's stablemate, both at 124 
pounds; Opening Verse, 119; Mi Selecto, 114; Stylish Winner, 113; and 
Santangelo, 110. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, last year's Kentucky Derby winner and horse of the year, 
returned after November knee surgery and won the Californian by three-quarters 
of a length over Stylish Winner in a three-horse field. Weights for the 
Californian were determined by money earned; weights for the Gold Cup have been 
assigned by Eual Wyatt, Hollywood Park's racing secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The high-weighted horse has won only one of the last seven Gold Cups, Ferdinand 
taking the race under 124 pounds in 1987. Since 1983, Erins Isle, John Henry, 
Precisionist (twice), Alysheba and Nasr el Arab were high-weighted and failed 
to win. BILL CHRISTINE

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers who are avoiding some traditional Southern California fisheries because 
of low water levels during the drought are missing some good fishing, the 
locals say. 
</P>
<P>
Dossy Mauthe of the boat rental/bait shop at Lake Casitas, near Ventura, said: 
"We still have 235 feet of water, so people don't have to worry about finding 
dune buggies running around where the lake used to be. This is a deep lake." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Holt of Sierra Sporting Goods on the Kern River said: "The water is low, 
but there's plenty of fishing water on the river and lake."

NEW WAVE COPS: LAW AND THE BREAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA, 84 OFFICERS HIT THE BEACH TO DETERMINE THE 
BEST SURFER. IT'S ALL PART OF THE 1990 POLICE SUMMER GAMES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Police officer Vern McGarry was in hot pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Scanning the surf with an expert eye trained from years on the beach, the 
15-year veteran of the San Clemente Police Department knew that he had one last 
chance to make some points. 
</P>
<P>
So with a series of quick kicks and thrusts, McGarry turned toward the rising 
wall of water, spun swiftly around and dug in for an exhilarating ride aboard 
his surfboard to the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a few good runs," McGarry, 36, said as he dropped his red, white and 
blue surfboard into the sand on Tuesday morning. "I felt really good. This is 
my home break." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that last-minute ride -- and a definite home break advantage -- helped 
McGarry take first place in his preliminary heat to go on to a second day of 
surfing competition today at Cotton's Point, just north of the San Onofre 
Nuclear Power Station. 
</P>
<P>
McGarry was one of 84 sworn law enforcement representatives who came from all 
over the state to compete in the surfing contest, part of a 44-event 
Olympic-style athletic competition sponsored by the California Police Athletic 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The 43 other events range from track and field, gymnastics and softball to 
target shooting, K-9 training and archery, and will be held next week in 
Sacramento, the host city for the 1990 Police Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
The games, which are expected to draw more than 6,000 contestants this year, 
are considered by organizers to be one of the largest amateur athletic 
competitions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old athletic competition was established to give officers from 
various departments -- including state park rangers, city cops, state 
university patrol officers and corrections officers -- a chance to test their 
skills against one another. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives these guys impetus to stay in shape," said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department Lt. Ed Hitchcock, an organizer of the annual Summer Games. 
"That is really the reason why we do this." 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente Police Department hosted the surfing event because -- as one 
organizer put it -- "the surf is not really rolling in Sacramento this time of 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the wave-riding officers said they look forward to trading their 
holsters for surfboard leashes once a year so that they can keep up with the 
sport many have pursued feverishly since they were teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Although some came from as far away as Santa Cruz and Capitola to try their 
luck on the South County waves, most competitors hailed from Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The largest teams were from the Orange and Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
departments and the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Many surfer cops said they once considered a career in surfing. Some have even 
been successful in competition outside the law enforcement event. 
</P>
<P>
Take Orange County Sheriff's Deputy James Moore, a 23-year-old former member of 
World Surfing Assn., for instance. He said he started competing in surfing 
contests when he was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore quit full-time surfing two years ago and traded his wet suit for a 
uniform last year, lured by the steady income. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get my priorities straight," he said. "Competitive surfing is a long 
and hard road. It takes everything you got." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Russell said he gave up his job representing 
surfboard and wet suit companies seven years ago to join law enforcement. He 
has not regretted that decision, although he said he doesn't get out into the 
water as much as he likes. 
</P>
<P>
His strategy in the police competition, he said, was to find only the big waves 
and pass on the small waves. 
</P>
<P>
"You move better when you have a lot of face to work with," he said, referring 
to the section of the wave that has yet to become white water. "Here, every 
point counts." 
</P>
<P>
The surfers received points for their choice of waves, the ability to stand up, 
and the moves they made once riding the swell toward shore, said Sam Conroy, 
San Clemente High School surf team coach, who headed the judging team. 
</P>
<P>
The surfers who finished in the top three of their preliminary rounds moved on 
to tougher competition today. Surfers will earn gold, silver and bronze medals 
in six categories. 
</P>
<P>
Conroy said he was impressed by the level of expertise of the surfers, 
considering that many of them were between 30 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sport where you're king at 18 and you're ancient at 30," Conroy 
said. "For their age group, they are doing really well." 
</P>
<P>
Not every successful surfer counted on his intimate knowledge of the way the 
waves break at Cotton's Point (shown on maps as San Mateo Point). 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a white jersey over his wet suit, West Covina Detective Dave Long, 32, 
expertly zigzagged across the face of the waves, executing sharp turns that 
seemed to defy gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added quickly, the event wasn't so much a time for him to show off 
his surfing prowess as it was an opportunity to spend a day at the beach with 
other police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We come out and have a blast," said Long, who won a gold medal last year, when 
the event was held in Oxnard. "I drag the wife and the kids out, and they hoot 
and holler. We have a good time and get to know people we would never meet. 
That is what this is all about."

DEVELOPERS HAVE IMAGE-BUILDING TO DO; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: IN ORANGE COUNTY, THEY MAKE WORST IMPRESSION OF ALL. EVEN LABOR UNIONS 
FARE BETTER. BUILDERS SAY THEY'RE MISUNDERSTOOD BY PUBLIC.

<P>
If there's one thing that most Orange County residents appear to agree on, it's 
that they don't care much for developers. 
</P>
<P>
No other institution fared so poorly on a recent poll designed to gauge voter 
reaction to a set of tax proposals. Fifty-one percent of 500 countywide 
respondents surveyed by Sacramento-based pollster J. Moore Methods said they 
had an unfavorable impression of real estate agents, a negative image topped 
only by the one given land developers, who polled a 57% unfavorable rating. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings were even worse in Laguna Beach, where a special sample of 200 
respondents found that 83% had an unfavorable impression of developers. 
</P>
<P>
In conservative Orange County, even labor unions did better than that, drawing 
unfavorable reviews from just 44% of the sample countywide and 47% in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, by contrast, did quite well in the public's eye -- though 
moderates came off better than extremists: Slow-growth advocates received 
favorable ratings of 49% countywide, compared to 33% recorded by no-growth 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, accustomed to taking some public relations hits, were not surprised 
by the results but said their negative image is undeserved. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't surprise me," said Dale Stuard, president of Stuard Industries, 
which owns Signature Homes based in El Toro. "People don't realize the role of 
builders. . . . They try to provide housing and a decent quality of life for 
those who want to move in." 
</P>
<P>
Christine D. Reed, executive director of the Building Industry Assn. of Orange 
County, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am alarmed because the industry is a major economic work base for the 
county," Reed said. "It says something about the way the entire industry is 
being perceived. A lot of it is related to new environmental concerns. We 
totally reject the idea that builders are totally at fault for all that is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The BIA, a trade organization of 1,200 construction-related companies, took a 
hit of its own in the poll. Its unfavorable rating of 24% outweighed its 
favorable mark by 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Although the poll was intended to give policy makers an idea of where the 
public stands on several tax issues, an array of institutions and personalities 
were included so the poll's sponsors could get a sense of who in the county was 
popular enough to lead a political charge. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, it seems, is celebrities: Actress Bette Midler, former football 
star O.J. Simpson and former Los Angeles Olympics Chairman Peter V. Ueberroth 
all scored better than 60% in the approval category countywide. Midler, in 
fact, had the highest approval rating of anyone in the Laguna Beach sample, 
outpolling even President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But local political figures are largely unknown, as are most developers. Of the 
respondents who knew of developers, however, most said they disliked them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're seeing is that people feel that there's somewhat of a lack 
of balance at the moment," said Paul Freeman, a public affairs consultant who 
works with the committee that commissioned the poll. "The score on developers 
to me suggests that there should be a better balance." 
</P>
<P>
Individual development companies took their lumps as well: Most respondents had 
not heard of many of them, but those that answered the survey gave most 
developers low marks. The Kathryn Thompson Development Co., for instance, 
received favorable ratings from 6% of the respondents, compared to 16% who 
viewed the firm unfavorably. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents were a little softer on developers when the survey asked about 
human beings: developers Henry T. Segerstrom and William Lyon, for instance, 
each won modest approval ratings, though Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren and 
Thompson still got mostly negative reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, negative reviews outweighed the positives for the Mission Viejo Co. 
and the Irvine Co., though in each of those cases the difference between the 
positives and negatives was within the poll's 3% margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
The slap was particularly sharp at the Irvine Co.: It worked with 
environmentalists to develop the poll and chipped in to help pay for it, only 
to draw unfavorable responses from 32% of the sample. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Hoffman, corporate vice president of the Irvine Co., wrote it off to the 
bad image of developers in general. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally people don't like developers until they want to buy a house in one 
of their projects," Hoffman said. "Once you have the house, you don't like 
developers anymore."

DIANNE KLEIN: SYMPATHY LOW FOR RECOVERY HOMES -- BUT NEED IS GREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Dianne Klein

<TEXT>
<P>
Charitable contributions are down in Orange County. Blame it on the times, on 
the mood, on the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, down, here, is an especially relative term. We've never been too 
loose with our change. 
</P>
<P>
When it's charity at stake, the needy must pass all sorts of tests. Who 
deserves our largess more? Him, or her, this group or that? Can we deduct it 
from our taxes or merely put our souls at rest? 
</P>
<P>
Some groups, let there be no doubt, are simply easier to help. I'm thinking of 
the innocent, children, the abused. 
</P>
<P>
Other causes are much harder to sell. Why should I part with my money, people 
say, if I don't approve? Drug addiction, alcoholism, AIDS. These are just some 
of the diseases damned with a social stigma as well. 
</P>
<P>
I know all this, on an intellectual level, and I don't approve. But as I found 
out the other night, I am certainly not immune. The sick can be unpleasant, 
putting you on edge. Desperation usually isn't too polite. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a liar, thief and a cheat for over 12 years," Bart Allen is telling me, 
and I'm thinking that sounds about right. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is one tough ex-con, 39 years old, who started drinking and doing drugs 
when he was in his teens. His face is hard, his hair thick and gray. His voice 
is clipped, angry and fast. 
</P>
<P>
If you saw Bart Allen walking on your side of the street, maybe you'd think 
about getting out of his way. There's something about him that puts me on 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Allen smiles, sometimes, but I had to stick around awhile before I saw that. 
That's because this man is intense, extremely focused, and now he wants to make 
a point. 
</P>
<P>
He's straight now, and he is helping others get that way, too. Someone else 
took the time with him; he is paying back his dues. 
</P>
<P>
But if Allen's two nonprofit Comeback House alcohol and drug recovery homes 
don't get more money, he says they will soon close. 
</P>
<P>
The homes, of which Allen is director, have been in operation for the last 10 
months in Garden Grove. They get no public funds. The 18 residents -- all of 
them men -- are supposed to pay $80 a week in rent, but most of them can't come 
up with that. 
</P>
<P>
"One out of three who get a job drink their first check," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
So Comeback House, which doesn't turn anyone away for lack of funds, is 
operating hand to mouth. They'd like to keep residents confined for 30 days of 
intense counseling before sending them out to find a job, but two days is all 
they can afford to do now. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole society is stupidly ignorant about addiction," Allen says. "That's 
where our frustration comes from. . . . Now that we've declared war on drugs, 
go get 'em and all that, it's impossible to get any help. . . . What people 
don't realize is that there will always be a supply of drugs while there is a 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
Drunks and addicts, he goes on, will do anything for a fix. They terrorize, 
maim and kill, behind the wheel or behind a gun. He knows, Allen says. That's 
what he did for years. 
</P>
<P>
Allen and the homes' manager, Bob Nicholl, are giving me their rap. They want 
me to understand, they say, but are afraid that I never will. 
</P>
<P>
They say only an addict -- "and alcohol is nothing but liquid heroin" -- can 
really know what it's like to lose control. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Stop drinking. Use willpower,' " Allen says. "Try using willpower 
when you've got diarrhea. It's the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
We keep talking, the three of us, and the conversation grows more relaxed. 
Nicholl, who's been straight for a year, tells me the story that led him here. 
</P>
<P>
He started drinking when he was 13 years old, and he's 31 now. He ran away from 
home shortly after that, joining a carnival, and his mother thought that was 
probably best all the way around. He's been confined to mental institutions 
eight times. As for drugs, Nicholl says it's easier to say what he hasn't taken 
than the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working at a hospital, setting up their computer system, they gave 
me the keys to the pharmacy," he says. "I would steal Brompton's cocktail, 
which is morphine, coke and alcohol, that they give to cancer patients. I took 
that for four years." 
</P>
<P>
But when Allen was working at Glenwood House, another Orange County addict 
recovery home that closed in 1986, he sponsored Nicholl and, he says, saved his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nicholl smiles and digs in his wallet. He shows me three color pictures of 
his new family: he and his common-law wife and their chubby 5-month-old child. 
</P>
<P>
In another room, the regular Monday night meeting is now under way. About 45 
people -- alcoholics and addicts, struggling, recovered and in various stages 
in between -- are taking their turns. 
</P>
<P>
Following the guidelines of Alcoholics Anonymous -- first names only and admit 
you're an alcoholic right up front -- the men tell their stories of triumph and 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny says he went to a banquet over the weekend at Chino State Prison with 
other members of AA. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real good feeling to be able to go in there, free," he says. "It made 
me think that if I weren't sober, I'd be back inside. Four months -- that was 
always my grace period for staying on the streets. After that, I was back 
incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
Jack, a 20-year heroin addict now clean with a family and a business of his 
own, tells the group they can bank on the fact that they'll be getting angry, 
but says their anger should rightly be directed at themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the newcomers," booms middle-aged Pete in a preacher's voice. "What 
we're doing here, talking all these things out, we have to do to live. That's 
simply the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
People are listening, smoking and chugging endless reserves of coffee from 
paper cups. Hands shoot up. It seems everyone is anxious for a turn. 
</P>
<P>
Then a basket is passed around, and people dig in their pockets for a few 
bucks. Every little bit helps. Right now, these little bits are about all most 
of these people have got.

DIAL-A-RIDE PROPOSAL FUELS PETITION DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Upset that the county plans to cut back dial-a-ride service for everyone except 
the elderly or handicapped and organized groups, a Costa Mesa woman has begun 
circulating a petition to prevent the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Many low-income families use it to take kids for doctor care, mental health 
services, speech therapy and other appointments," Jeanne Thorpe said. "Try 
walking three children, a stroller and a diaper bag to the bus stop in the 
rain." 
</P>
<P>
The board of the Orange County Transit District tentatively voted Monday to 
limit the door-to-door service in a one-year pilot program. Board Chairman 
Roger Stanton said the plan will allow OCTD to improve dial-a-ride for those 
who really need it rather than those who use it as a convenience. 
</P>
<P>
But Nellie Kaniski, coordinator of a support program for single mothers who 
attend Rancho Santiago College and receive government aid, said that some 
students use dial-a-ride because they can't afford cars and don't feel safe 
waiting for a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Armstrong, a Fullerton School District board member who also opposes the 
OCTD plan, said she thinks it is unfair to shut out the occasional user who 
takes dial-a-ride when a car is unavailable and a bus is inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Cain, a spokesman for the Orange County chapter of the National 
Federation of the Blind, said members don't want to be treated differently. 
</P>
<P>
"In the days when the county should be thinking about improving public transit 
service and getting people out of their cars, they're thinking about cutting 
back dial-a-ride," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
Although dial-a-ride's hours of operation wouldn't be cut, the number of people 
served would be. A transit district spokeswoman estimated that only about half 
of those using dial-a-ride are elderly or handicapped. Most don't have cars and 
about half have incomes of $20,000 or less, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton said he has heard mostly praise for the plan, which would retain 
Saturday service and service for groups that contract regularly with 
dial-a-ride, such as Headstart. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one complaint from a woman who said that she takes dial-a-ride to go to 
Wild Rivers and didn't want to walk to the gate from the regular bus route," 
Stanton said. "I mean, come on, I don't think the general public has sympathy 
for devoting this system to people who have choices." 
</P>
<P>
But board member William Farris, who voted against the plan along with Richard 
B. Edgar, said he wants to increase the service hours and keep dial-a-ride open 
for anyone who wants to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe said she hopes to gather thousands of signatures by the time the plan 
returns to the board with final details next month. SHANNON SANDS

UPWARD BOUND IS HAILED BY EDUCATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 80 students are less likely to become involved with gangs and more likely 
will return to school this fall as a result of Upward Bound, a new program 
operated this year by the La Habra City School District. 
</P>
<P>
"School attendance went up. GPAs (grade point averages) went way up. Kids 
started to feel positive about themselves," Imperial Middle School Principal 
Betty Bidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell credits the program, conducted by youth and community services 
coordinator Felipe Plascencia, with improving attitudes and performance. 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia met twice weekly with about 40 students at Imperial School and also 
with 40 other 7th- and 8th-graders at Washington Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a really great response from the Spanish-speaking community," said 
Rich Hermann, the district's superintendent. "We feel very privileged to be 
touched by Felipe and really appreciate the good work he has done. The kids he 
has worked with have developed strong self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia, 24, is a 1989 graduate of Cal State Fullerton. He plans to attend 
law school in the fall. Replacing him as a role model and adviser, Hermann 
said, will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The students saw me as a friend, not as a teacher," Plascencia said. They 
addressed him as "Felipe," he said, "so that they could immediately relate to 
me. I didn't want them to call me mister." 
</P>
<P>
Teaching youngsters about Latino history was an area of emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason these kids are involved in gangs is that they don't know who they 
are," Plascencia suggested. "Because they don't know their history, they hate 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia said he used the Socratic method of dialogue in small group settings 
and tried to develop critical thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
"When we talked about gangs, we asked, 'What can you do when this happens?' or 
'What are some of the negative things that occur when you are involved in this 
type of thing?' 
</P>
<P>
"I used a lot of whys," he said. "Sometimes, I could see them trying to come up 
with solutions or answers to my questions. When I saw that happen, I knew I was 
doing my job." 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia said he sees parents as the key to success for most children. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to understand the situation their kids are in," he said. "They have 
to be supportive, to encourage their kids, to keep a positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The future lawyer said he hopes to settle in Orange County but he also intends 
to remain active with children. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the more kids I reach, the better," he said.DAVID F. BURKE

INN REPAINTS AFTER BRUSH WITH CITY LAW

<P>
The fight to brighten the Dana Point Inn is over. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the inn, who several months ago tried to repaint its exterior a peach 
color, gave in to the city's demands this week and returned the 88-room, 
five-story inn to city-approved blue and gray. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost," desk clerk Petrine Hinrichsen said Tuesday. "That's why we're 
putting the finishing touches on the blue today." 
</P>
<P>
Painters were halted in mid-stroke last March by city officials, and the 
hotel's paint job had remained unfinished since then, partly peach and partly 
blue and gray. Peach is not on the city's approved pallette of colors and could 
not be applied, city officials told the inn's owners, Jett Mora and the Los 
Angeles-based Incomvest Co. 
</P>
<P>
The approved pallette consists of five colors: cool gray, cool blue, cool 
green, lead red or white, according to Ed Knight, the city's director of 
community development. 
</P>
<P>
Inn Manager Linda Dizon said the peach exterior was in response to customer 
comments and was an attempt to brighten the look of the inn. An application to 
change the color was later filed with the city but was denied, said Incomvest 
spokeswoman Grace Beleno. 
</P>
<P>
There was no choice but to hire painters to redo the exterior with no 
compensation from the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out the expense, including labor and materials, to start over and do it 
again," Beleno said. She estimated the cost so far at about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Just how many customers may have decided against staying at the inn because of 
its unfinished exterior Beleno could not say. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is that it looked awful for so many months," she said. LEN HALL

REDEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR 5 PARCELS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council gave initial approval this week to a plan to redevelop five 
city parcels totaling nearly 200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing testimony from owners and tenants of the One-Stop Shopping Center 
on Orangethorpe Avenue, the council decided to eliminate that 6.6-acre parcel 
from the redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the project are the Buena Park Mall/Handyman site on La Palma 
Avenue; the Orange County flood control area near Malvern Avenue and Dale 
Street; the Builder's Square site near Beach Boulevard and Malvern Avenue; the 
Buena Park Drive-In and strawberry fields near Holder Street and Lincoln 
Avenue, and the northwest corner of Crescent and Western avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The approval Monday night does not mean that the bulldozers will start moving 
in, said Mayor Donald T. Bone. Instead, the city will work with property owners 
and let them offer ideas, said Acting Director of Redevelopment Gustavo Duran. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans call for expanding established commercial properties such as 
the Buena Park Mall and building homes in vacant areas. This will take place 
over the entire 30 years set aside for the project, Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval is expected at the council's next meeting, scheduled for July 
2.LYNDA NATALI

RESIDENTS CELEBRATE DOWN-ZONING STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents who have fought for four years to limit development in the Cypress 
Street neighborhood are celebrating this week after the Planning Commission 
decided that the area should be rezoned for lower density. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to the City Council, which residents say closely reflects a 
petition drafted by the community, suggests that the six-block area, where 
multiple dwellings are now allowed, be down-zoned to allow duplexes at most. 
</P>
<P>
Residents hope the change will help them control overcrowding, crime and gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good beginning," said Bea Vega, a 39-year resident of the Old Towne 
community. "It will be a nicer place to live." Vega said she is optimistic that 
the City Council will accept the commission's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Don Greek opposed the change, saying it was not an effective way 
to upgrade the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also voted unanimously to recommend a general plan amendment to 
rezone the Santa Fe Railroad Depot area from light industry to a limited 
business and residential district, if the City Council also can guarantee an 
emergency fund that businesses may use to help them relocate in case of 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the promise of financial help, longtime owners of industrial property 
said they were unhappy with the recommendation because rezoning would diminish 
the value of their land. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Baier, whose family has owned property in the 33-acre industrial area 
for 70 years, said that if the area is rezoned as residential, his two lots 
would sell for one-third the current appraised value of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission recommendation follows a study two years ago that 
showed that the depot area was under-utilized and suggested that it be 
developed as a commercial and retail center to attract pedestrian traffic from 
Orange Plaza.MARY HELEN BERG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
ALIEN REPORT GIVEN SOME SOLID SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of a Santa Ana citizens advisory group Tuesday defended its 
recommendation that police cooperate more with immigration authorities to stem 
the flow of illegal aliens into the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Don Hertel, chairman of the Mayor's Task Force on Neighborhood Standards 
and Preservation, agreed with critics who charged that membership of the task 
force inadequately reflected the population of Santa Ana, where more than half 
of the city's 235,000 residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense that there was not enough representation in the group," said 
Hertel, who is an architect. "We felt that there should have been more Asians 
and Latinos in the group, but we were not party to who was going to be on the 
task force." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young, who appointed the committee a year and half ago, said he 
had selected more representatives from different ethnic groups, but members had 
gradually dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make people stay on citizen advisory groups if they don't want to," 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
However, former school board member James A. Richards, who headed the 
eight-member subcommittee on immigration, said the fact that seven were Anglo 
and one was black had nothing to do with the panel's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ignorant to think that a person's skin color is going to affect what he 
is going to do on the task force," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards defended the task force's recommendations as being "realistic" for 
Santa Ana, adding that the report was intended to be "blunt." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the factors that causes overcrowding is the concentration of illegal 
aliens," Richards said. "Santa Ana has become a haven for illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
Hertel added: "We don't want neighborhood Gestapo tactics in Santa Ana. But the 
city is carrying the burden of illegal aliens here." 
</P>
<P>
Young said he expected the task force report to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to get into the kind of Costa Mesa debate on what to do with 
illegal aliens," Young said, referring to that city's efforts to discourage 
aliens from taking up residence there by denying them some services. "But the 
city has a major problem that it is trying to deal with. We are trying to be 
fair, and we're trying to do the right things." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman John Acosta, who has criticized the task force for not having 
more Latinos and Asians, said he believes that some Santa Ana residents are 
fearful of immigrants in general. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some old-time Anglo residents in our community who are running 
scared," Acosta said. "They have told me in some instances that they want the 
Mexicans to go back to Mexico and they want Asians to get back on the boat and 
go home." 
</P>
<P>
The report detailed what it considered to be the city's five most critical 
"issues of concern for the 1990s": neighborhood overcrowding, the impact of the 
non-English-speaking immigrant population, crime and gang activity, traffic 
congestion and the environment. It called for the Santa Ana Police Department 
to cooperate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service "to enforce 
existing laws and reduce the disproportionate number of undocumented people 
settling in the Santa Ana area." LILY ENG

RANCHO SANTIAGO PICKS NEW ARTS DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A theater arts director has been chosen as Rancho Santiago Community College 
District's new dean of fine arts and performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
Thom B. Hill was named by the district's Board of Trustees at their meeting 
last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hill currently is dean of administrative and cultural services at Citrus 
College in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
"Thom brings to this position a wealth of experience as an arts administrator," 
said Carter Doran, Rancho Santiago's vice chancellor of academic affairs. "He 
combines the best of both worlds for RSC: strong fiscal management skills and 
an equally strong background in the creative processes of artistic instruction 
and production." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago's Fine and Performing Arts division includes the fields of art, 
theater, dance, music, photography, speech communications, telecommunications 
and journalism. Hill will be responsible for curriculum planning and liaison 
with local arts organizations and the arts community, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 43, whose annual salary will be $70,956, said his first priority would be 
to decide with the faculty in each field how their program should develop over 
the next decade.

In an attempt to build community-wide support for a downtown redevelopment 
project, the Community Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday voted to form a 
citizens' committee that will review the plan and recommend changes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials this week released plans to convert a 6-acre parcel, located one 
block south of Mission San Juan Capistrano, into a Historic Town Center that 
would pay tribute in a parklike setting to the city's roots. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for a creating a 3.5-acre archeological park, preserving two 
historic homes and keeping intact most of the Redevelopment Agency-owned 
businesses along the city's main thoroughfare, Camino Capistrano. The project 
also proposes to realign Ortega Highway south to Verdugo Street. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency directors, who are also council members, voted to form 
a 10-member committee that will include archeology experts, historians, 
merchants and citizens. Appointments to the advisory committee will be made at 
an unspecified future date. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to pull from all facets of the community because everybody 
has something at stake," Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials formulated this latest redevelopment plan after an earlier 
proposal was met with ardent opposition. That plan, drawn up in 1985, called 
for a 125-room hotel, restaurants and retail shops. Opponents argued that the 
development was too intense for a historic area that contains archeological 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
But members of Friends of San Juan Capistrano, a group formed in 1987 to oppose 
original redevelopment plans and to promote historic preservation, praised the 
current plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, San Juan Capistrano takes a bold step forward for preservation and 
sensitive community planning," said Mark Clancey, president of Friends of San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory panel will review the plan, identify potential problems and 
recommend changes, City Manager Stephen B. Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency also pushed for creation of a nonprofit organization 
that would oversee and raise money for further archeological exploration of the 
Historic Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, 1988, the city has spent $1 million on archeological excavations 
of the site, which uncovered Indian artifacts and building foundations from the 
late 18th Century. Portions of the area are shown on early 19th-Century maps as 
a town square that extended from the mission grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials are reluctant to spend more of the taxpayers' money to 
explore the site beyond what is legally required for environmental 
documentation, Friess said.

SWIM MEET OF CHAMPIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RAPID RISE SURPRISES MISSION VIEJO'S ERIC DIEHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rise of Eric Diehl has begun. He has gone from promising young swimmer to 
one with a national reputation, all in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the next step is close at hand. In a month, Diehl will compete at the 
Goodwill Games in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
A strong showing there would give him a foothold on the international level. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has happened so fast, it's kind of caught me by surprise," said 
Diehl, who will be a senior at Mission Viejo High School this fall. "But I want 
to compete in the Olympics. That's my long, long term goal. I need to get more 
experience against elite swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl figures to get plenty of that in the next several weeks. Besides the 
Goodwill Games, he will swim in the Swim Meet of Champions, which begins 
Thursday at the Marguerite Recreation Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, which continues through Sunday, will feature several top American 
swimmers, including Janet Evans, plus members of the East German national team. 
</P>
<P>
It will give Diehl a chance to test how far he's come since winning the 
1,000-meter freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Short Course National Championships 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to swim fast, but all my focus is on next month," Diehl said. "But this 
meet will give me another chance to see where I stand. It will give me an idea 
of how well I will swim at the Goodwill Games." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl, who swims for the Mission Viejo Nadadores, will compete in the 800-meter 
freestyle in Seattle. He qualified for the games by winning the 1,000 freestyle 
at the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 8 minutes 58.26 seconds was a personal best and made him the only 
swimmer to finish under nine minutes in the event at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised by my performance," Diehl said. "I expected to do 
well, especially in that event. But I expected the college swimmers to be much 
faster. I really thought I was a long shot to win." 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that Diehl will win Thursday in the 800 freestyle. First, he 
hasn't tapered his training for the meet. Second, he'll be facing stiff 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Artur Wojdat, who also swims for the Nadadores, and Sebastian Wiese of East 
Germany also are entered in the event. Wojdat, who competes for the University 
of Iowa, was a member of Poland's Olympic team in 1988 and Wiese is ranked 
fifth in the world in the 800 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"The meet will be faster this year," Diehl said. "Especially the 800. With 
Artur alone, it will be faster. But there are a lot more quality swimmers in 
that event this year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 800, Diehl also will compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 1,500 
freestyles. It will be his last meet before tapering for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
But Diehl's summer of competition will not end in Seattle. After the Goodwill 
Games, he will go to Austin, Texas, for the U.S. Swimming Long Course Senior 
Nationals, which also will be the qualifying meet for the United States' World 
Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl will compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong showing at the nationals could only enhance Diehl's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see how I do at the Goodwill Games," Diehl said. "Then I'll know how 
successful my year has been." 
</P>
<P>
Swim Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
The only events Thursday will be the men's and women's 800 freestyle. The 
finals are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. . . . A group of 18 East German 
swimmers will compete, nine men and nine women. Besides Wiese, who also is 
ranked seventh in the world in the 1,500, the team includes Sabina Schulze, who 
is ranked seventh in the 200 freestyle and 10th in the 100 freestyle, and 
Christiane Sievert, who is ranked eighth in the 100 butterfly . . . The United 
States' top two women distance swimmers, Evans and Jane Skillman, will be 
matched against each other Thursday in the 800 freestyle. 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: PUNCHLINE IN TRUMP JOKES ISN'T SO FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The whole country is having a good laugh at Donald Trump's expense, but the 
smiles will fade when people realize that the loudmouth New York developer's 
financial troubles are only a symptom of a much more serious national problem. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, with roughly $2 billion in bank loans (plus $1.3 billion in bond issues) 
on his casinos, office buildings and hotels, has borrowed only a tiny fraction 
of the $365 billion in bank loans to commercial real estate developers. The 
1980s saw an unprecedented explosion in such lending; today's level is nearly 
three times what it was in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
And unnecessary. "Excess lending exacerbated already overbuilt conditions," 
says David Shulman, head of real estate research at the Salomon Bros. 
investment firm. The result is rising vacancy rates in office and apartment 
buildings in almost every part of the country and a big increase in delinquent 
loans at banks. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is potentially huge for U.S. banks, which have loaned more to 
commercial developers than they have to developing countries, or to oil 
drillers and real estate projects in Texas and Oklahoma in the 1970s and early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Texas is recovering after a decade of economic depression. But 
elsewhere problems are widespread. From the Northeast down through the 
Washington, D.C., area to Florida, real estate values are falling -- as they 
are in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy rates are rising in the Midwest, and in the West conditions are mixed. 
Commercial real estate is not a problem in the Northwest or in Utah, says Jeff 
Thredgold, chief economist of Key Bank in Salt Lake City. However, he adds, 
hotels are overbuilt in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
And in California bankers cautiously acknowledge that commercial office space 
is overbuilt in Orange Country and Los Angeles, but say rental-rate decreases 
are "modest to date." Last week, the Home FedBank of San Diego caused a stir by 
raising loan-loss reserves because of troubled commercial loans in its home 
market. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain: Because the overbuilding of offices, apartments and 
shopping centers has been so extreme, real estate problems will be more than 
short term. 
</P>
<P>
"With few exceptions, almost every community has a sufficient supply of 
commercial real estate for the foreseeable future," says Benjamin Lambert, head 
of EastDil Realty, an affiliate of Nomura Securities. How long is foreseeable? 
"That depends on how fast the economy grows," Lambert says. 
</P>
<P>
And right now the U.S. economy is hardly growing at all. "We're in for a real 
tough time," says a real estate dealer glumly. "A lot of big people are hanging 
on by their fingernails -- a lot more out there like Trump." 
</P>
<P>
So what does it mean to you? The decline in real estate values and troubles in 
the banks could tip the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Construction shutdowns will lead to layoffs in businesses from architecture to 
cement; insurance companies -- the long-term real estate lenders -- will see 
growing defaults in commercial mortgages starting next year, says Shulman of 
Salomon Bros. Declining real estate values will be deflationary. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that home prices are not yet widely affected -- although 
values have come down sharply in the Northeast, less so in California. But if 
there is a general deflation, home prices won't be immune. 
</P>
<P>
So Trump's troubles are no joke. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's put it in perspective. A recession -- a period usually of a year to 
18 months when the economy declines -- isn't the end of the world. Indeed, the 
U.S. economy is almost in recession now, with growth of less than 2% and retail 
sales falling as people spend less, save more. 
</P>
<P>
But it is unlikely to be a deep recession. As noted, savings are increasing and 
banking experts predict that there will be no shortage of money for home 
mortgage and consumer loans in the years ahead. Small businesses suffer as 
banks cut back on loans, but benefit as lower commercial rents encourage new 
ventures -- as they're doing in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
So the nation will probably avoid a long and severe recession such as Texas 
went through in the 1980s, when almost every bank in the state failed. 
</P>
<P>
But that's small consolation for the current peril to jobs and home values. And 
questions arise: Why did the banks lend so much to real estate developers? 
Because they wanted to expand their business just like everybody else. U.S. 
banks collectively may have earned more than $6 billion in fees, not to mention 
what they earned in interest, on $365 billion in real estate loans. "You never 
lost your job for lending to Donald Trump," says a sage former banker, "you 
probably got a promotion." 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, bankers like most everybody else got caught up in the cycle of 
economic enthusiasm; as the economy grew, so did the illusion that more people 
with more money would need more condos and shopping malls and offices. Now the 
building has stopped, and we find we don't need as many condos or malls or 
offices. And we probably don't need as many banks either. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why bankers see no humor in Trump's troubles.

CABLE TV, NBC HOLD TALKS ON SATELLITE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE PRINCIPALS ARE HUDDLING OVER THE CONGRESSIONAL FATE OF THE SKY 
CABLE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cable television industry and NBC are engaged in last-minute, 
behind-the-scenes maneuvering to affect congressional action on a bill that 
could help determine the success or failure of the $1.3-billion Sky Cable 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Cable is a joint venture among NBC, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Hughes 
Communications Inc. and Cablevision Systems Corp. It seeks to launch a 
108-channel, satellite-based direct broadcast system in the United States by 
1993 and thus take a commanding position in the next generation of television. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and News Corp. would contribute their programming expertise -- News Corp. 
owns the Fox television network and 20th Century Fox movie studio -- while 
Hughes would provide the satellite technology. Cablevision, one of the largest 
owners of local cable systems in the country, is also a partner with NBC in 
various cable TV networks. Viewers would receive the programs through small 
antennae about the size of a dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would toughen 
regulation of the cable TV industry. Among the elements in the bill that the 
cable industry opposes is a provision barring cable program services, such as 
HBO and ESPN, from being sold only to local cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
Such a provision is a victory for NBC, which lobbied heavily for the bill to 
require cable programmers to sell to competitors, including DBS systems such as 
Sky Cable. NBC believes that local cable systems are seeking to keep popular 
cable program services off Sky Cable and other potential satellite networks. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest maneuvering, Tele-Communications Inc. Chief Executive John C. 
Malone sent a letter Monday to NBC President Robert C. Wright requesting that 
the network negotiate with TCI to allow it to carry NBC programming on some of 
TCI's local cable systems where NBC currently does not have an affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Malone said it was TCI's goal to increase the amount of local news and sports 
programming in markets not served by NBC affiliates and sought to affiliate 
some of its rural cable systems with the network. The idea is highly unusual, 
and NBC is expected to turn down the request because it would strain relations 
with affiliates, who already suspect that the network is looking for 
alternatives to distribute its programming. 
</P>
<P>
But if NBC declines to negotiate with TCI, then many in the industry expect TCI 
to use the issue in its lobbying efforts, pointing up the contradiction that 
NBC wants exclusive agreements with its affiliates but not between cable 
programmers and local system operators. 
</P>
<P>
Local cable systems, the majority of which are owned or affiliated with large 
"multiple system operators" such as TCI or Time Warner's American Telephone 
&amp; Communications, are opposed to the measure because they fear that 
satellite systems could replace cable as the country's leading purveyor of 
television programs. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes 
indicated last week that he might favor non-exclusive deals for small 
competitors to cable, but not for the "Generals -- General Electric or General 
Motors." (GM owns Hughes Communications.) 
</P>
<P>
Both NBC President Robert C. Wright and News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert 
Murdoch have recently lobbied lawmakers in Washington about the new cable 
reregulation bill. Next week the bill moves to the House telecommunications 
subcommittee for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Thompson, vice president of government relations for TCI, said the 
company has long been looking for ways to finance "hometown TV" in cities and 
towns where there are no local network affiliates. He said TCI's plan would use 
the revenues it generated from local advertising sales on the NBC channel to 
support a local news operation. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was sent the letter, Thompson said, because it is the No. 1 ranked network, 
but he acknowledged that other issues were involved as well. "NBC has ratings 
which are 10 times in excess of the most popular cable network, but for timing 
purposes this is probably as good a time as any since they have indicated they 
are soft on the exclusivity issue."

Mattel Sued for Cleanup Costs: A $1.4-million lawsuit was filed against Mattel 
Inc. by H&amp;H Paramount, a Los Angeles limited partnership, which claims that 
the toy maker "actively concealed" its use and disposal of hazardous waste at a 
plastic molding plant in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. At the time H&amp;H 
bought the property in 1971, Mattel had been a tenant for one year, the suit 
says. It was not until after 1988 that H&amp;H learned Mattel used the site as 
a plastic injection molding facility, where it had used "various dangerous, 
toxic and hazardous substances," according to the lawsuit. Hawthorne-based 
Mattel could not be reached for comment.

'Dolphin-Safe' StarKist Tuna Arrives: The first 100 cases, enough for 10,000 
tuna sandwiches, were unveiled at a Beverly Hills restaurant. At the press 
conference were actor Morgan Fairchild, company mascot Charlie the Tuna and 
environmentalists from Earth Island Institute, Greenpeace, the American Oceans 
Campaign, the American Humane Assn. and the Earth Communications Office. 
StarKist, the first canner to decide not to buy tuna caught in ways that 
endanger dolphins, donated the 100 cases to the Los Angeles Mission.

Occidental Is Disappointed: Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it was 
"disappointed" that Standard &amp; Poor's had downgraded its credit rating the 
day before, and reaffirmed its intention to maintain a $2.50-a-share annual 
dividend. "Our financial position is strong, and our cash flow will continue to 
support our longstanding dividend policy," the company said. "The lower debt 
rating will have very little impact on Oxy as our debt maturity schedule has no 
more debt coming due this year and only $52 million coming due next year," the 
company added.

LOOKING AHEAD: CELLULAR PHONES: MEDIUM FOR MASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cellular telephones promise to be the personal communication medium of the 
1990s as they move rapidly from business tool to mass consumer product. 
</P>
<P>
Annual sales have increased from 72,000 in 1982 to a projected 1.2 million this 
year. In 1995, an estimated 3 million cellular phones will be sold and 5 
million will be in use. 
</P>
<P>
As have other electronic consumer products, such as hand-held calculators, 
VCRs, CD players and digital watches, cellular phones will follow the cycle of 
high prices shortly after introduction and price decreases as their popularity 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
Cellular phone revenue is expected to decline from $725 million in 1992 to $400 
million after 1995. In 1984, the average price of a cellular phone was $1,600. 
Today it is $550, with some units selling for less than $400. By 2010, cellular 
phones are expected to go for about $60. 
</P>
<P>
Digital cellular phone shipments are expected to begin next year. By 1995, 
digital will capture an estimated 40% of the market. In Los Angeles, New York 
and Chicago, analog cellular networks are near capacity. Because digital allows 
for three times the number of users per network than does analog, network 
operators in these areas are expected to use digital technology to expand their 
subscriber base. In addition, digital voice transmission is preferred over 
analog because of reduced cross-talk and static. 
</P>
<P>
With economies of volume and technological advances, the value of the 
semiconductors in telephones will decrease. The value of semiconductors in 
phones sold in the United States will decline from an estimated $54 million in 
1990 to $45 million in 1995. Suppliers of telephone semiconductors will have to 
decide whether they can compete in the market in the long term. Suppliers that 
are not -- or cannot become -- high-volume, low-cost producers should be 
prepared to leave the market sometime during the next five years. 
</P>

Bad News for Venture Capitalists 
</P>
<P>
California venture capitalists scrambled for technology start-up opportunities 
in the mid- and late 1980s. However, the failure rate of the start-up 
companies, combined with the stock market crash of 1987, means big changes in 
technology financing. 
</P>
<P>
Today's venture capitalists face lower returns, fewer public offerings and 
impatient fund managers looking for better performance. Fewer and fewer tech 
deals are reaching the financing stage. Venture capitalists must also cope with 
an extended time frame -- years, usually -- between start-up financing and 
public offering. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the news for venture capitalists is mostly bad. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by Investor Dealer Digest shows that the number of public offerings in 
technology companies declined to 25 last year from a high of 178 seven years 
ago. Twenty-seven offerings are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
Such numbers clearly will not support the more than 650 U.S. venture capital 
firms. Unless dramatic changes occur in the fields of technology offerings or 
mergers and acquisitions, it's conceivable that 30% to 40% of venture firms 
will vanish within four years. 
</P>
<P>
As venture firms have raised their standards, alternative funding sources have 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by a cheap dollar, foreign investors are acquiring technology to fill 
gaps in their home countries. They often find hungry U.S. entrepreneurs eager 
to bypass traditional venture capital channels. In 1989, Japan invested more 
than $300 million in 50 American technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, a technology-start-up entrepreneur finds a foreign investor more 
patient, more supportive and less distracting than an American investor. As the 
market becomes more global, the entrepreneur finds the foreign investor even 
more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
A consequence of this financial market shift is that more equity will pass to 
foreign companies. In some cases, foreign investors will end up owning a good 
chunk of critical new U.S. technology. Many argue that because the technology 
industry is rapidly becoming global, the transfer is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Another consequence of current trends is that strong U.S. venture capital firms 
will get stronger. In spite of the somewhat gloomy environment, many larger 
private firms are reporting solid earnings and returns on investments.

Rykoff-Sexton Inc.: The restaurant and institutional food supply company said 
net income for fiscal 1990 ended April 28 totaled $11.3 million, down 45% from 
the $20.6 million reported a year earlier. Sales rose 8% to $1.4 billion. The 
Los Angeles firm had predicted reduced earnings because of lower-than-expected 
sales increases, delays in cost-reduction efforts and a $2-million pretax 
charge related to bad debt and employee health-care benefits.

jumped 14.6% to a record $504.5 million. Revenue rose 4.9% to $6.1 billion, 
also a record. The company attributed the strong performance to sales-volume 
gains and price increases.

BOTH SIDES PLAN TO APPEAL RULING IN AMOCO CADIZ SPILL

Lawyers for Amoco Corp. and French plaintiffs are unhappy with a judge's ruling 
that Amoco should pay nearly $160 million in damages for a 1978 oil spill off 
northern France, indicating that a final settlement is still far away. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle on Monday issued a seven-page order in the 
case, spelling out recommended damages for the massive spill from the Amoco 
Cadiz tanker. 
</P>
<P>
He set July 24 as the date that he would specify final judgments and instructed 
parties to the lawsuit to calculate interest owed them. 
</P>
<P>
Norgle's order says he is in basic agreement with damage recommendations made 
last year by former U.S. District Judge Frank McGarr, who was appointed a 
special master in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect to have to pay it," Frank Cicero, a lawyer representing 
Chicago-based Amoco, said of the expected judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Judge McGarr erred on both his legal rulings and his evidentiary 
rulings. We believe we'll get it reversed." 
</P>
<P>
Cicero said the company believes that the shipbuilder, not Amoco, was at fault 
in the spill. He said the company will appeal to the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of 
Appeals after the July 24 hearing. The appeals process could take two years, 
Cicero said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Marwedel, a lawyer for the French plaintiffs, said his clients will 
appeal because they believe that Amoco is liable and that the award was too 
little.

CARL'S JR. TO BEGIN TV ADS IN SPANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carl's Jr. smiling star will soon greet guests in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
A new Spanish-language TV campaign will be launched this week to reach Latinos, 
primarily in Southern California. Even the chain's founder, Carl N. Karcher, 
will test his Spanish skills in the ads, when he signs off with: "Los 
esperamos." Translation: "We're waiting for you." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Carl's Jr. waited a long time before aiming directly at the Latino 
market. This marks the first time the Anaheim-based fast-food chain has 
targeted Latinos in TV ads, even though Latinos account for more than 40% of 
its business. Rival chains such as McDonald's and Burger King -- which have 
much larger ad budgets -- have advertised in Spanish for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't afford to advertise to this market until now," said Bob Wisely, 
group vice president of marketing at Carl's Jr. Now, the company has 
discovered, it can no longer afford not to. 
</P>
<P>
The chain, which is owned by Carl Karcher Enterprises, will spend about 
$800,000 on the Spanish-language campaign this year -- a fraction of its 
$20-million ad budget. 
</P>
<P>
But ads on Spanish TV stations are relatively inexpensive, Wisely said. The TV 
ads, which generally feature families eating at Carl's Jr. restaurants, will 
appear locally on stations KMEX-Channel 34 and KVEA-Channel 52. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers at about one-third of the chain's 540 units will soon be 
wearing smiling-star buttons that say: "Bienvenidos a la estrella." That means 
"Welcome to the star." 
</P>
<P>
Menu boards at many locations also will be translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the chain's hourly workers are Latino, but none of its officers 
or board members are, Wisely said. "That's obviously something we need to work 
on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts generally say that Carl's Jr. is making a good, albeit tardy, 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"Their competition has been at it for a while," said Ray Durazo, partner at 
Moya, Villanueva &amp; Durazo, a Los Angeles research firm specializing in the 
Latino market. "But if their campaign is unique enough, they might be in a 
position to rise above the background noise." One recent survey indicates that 
Latinos in Southern California are very aware of Carl's Jr. Some 200 heads of 
Latino households were recently asked to name their favorite fast-food 
restaurant. A total of 70% named McDonald's, but the same number that named 
Burger King -- 8% -- also named Carl's Jr. "Considering they haven't been 
advertising to Hispanics," said Roger Sennott, general manager at the San Diego 
research firm Market Development Inc., "that's pretty remarkable."

VIEJO BANCORP STOCK MOVES TO NASDAQ SYSTEM, CLOSES AT $5.50

Capitalizing on its recent financial success, the parent company of Mission 
Viejo National Bank moved its stock up a notch in status Tuesday when its 
shares started trading on the National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated 
Quotations system. 
</P>
<P>
In its first day of trading on NASDAQ's national market system, Viejo Bancorp 
stock closed at $5.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ listing means that shares in Viejo Bancorp will be easier to sell 
and more readily available to purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, any of the 440 shareholders who wanted to buy or sell Viejo 
Bancorp's stock had to go to Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., a brokerage that made a 
market in the stock. Directors own 54% of the company's 2.6 million shares, 
with the biggest chunk, about 765,000 shares or 26.7%, owned by Viejo Bancorp 
Chairman William T. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
The company is riding a wave of high profitability as its banking subsidiary 
was among the top 100 community banks nationwide in a key measure of financial 
performance -- return on assets. It posted $2.4 million in net income last 
year, earning a 2.2% return on assets. Most major banks do not garner more than 
a 1% return.

A trio of Orange County companies -- a supplier of stop-smoking products, a 
pharmaceuticals firm and a computer maker -- were among Wall Street's hottest 
performers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage Life Products Inc., a small Laguna Hills company, saw its stock price 
soar 30.2% after it announced the settlement of major lawsuit with its supplier 
of anti-smoking aids. The stock was the biggest percentage gainer on the 
over-the-counter market Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Right behind was Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc., a Newport Beach 
firm whose stock price jumped 28.9% after it was disclosed that the New England 
Journal of Medicine will publish a favorable report Thursday on the company's 
experimental AIDS drug, isoprinosine. The company's stock was the 
second-largest percentage gainer Tuesday among over-the-counter issues. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, MAI Basic Four, a Tustin computer company, rose 
37.5 cents per share -- or 21% -- to close at $2.125, making it the biggest 
percentage gainer on the Big Board. MAI was not known to have issued any public 
statements Tuesday that would have caused the gain in its stock, and company 
officials could not be reached for comment.

Advantage Life, a marketer of CigArrest chewing gum, tablets and vitamins 
designed to help smokers kick the habit, saw its stock price jump $1 to close 
at $4.3125 a share on National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated 
Quotations' over-the-counter system. 
</P>
<P>
The stock price hike started shortly after the firm issued a press release 
saying that it had reached a tentative, out-of-court settlement with it major 
supplier, according to William Cowi, Advantage's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, More Direct Health Products Inc. in Carlsbad sued Advantage for 
allegedly breaching a distribution agreement. The tentative settlement covers 
all major issues, Cowi said, and is expected to be signed within the next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives Advantage distribution rights "in perpetuity" for its line 
of anti-smoking aids and gives More Direct 400,000 warrants for unregistered 
Advantage stock at the June 12 price of $3.1875 a share. Any stock More Direct 
buys could not be sold for two years. Advantage has 4.6 million shares 
outstanding now.

Entrepreneur Magazine publisher Clare N. Thain resigned last week, Entrepreneur 
Chairman Peter Shea said Tuesday, and his duties at the cash-strapped 
publication will be assumed by Shea and Associate Publisher James L. 
Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Shea also said he had turned down a joint-venture deal with Omni Group, a New 
York-based publishing arm of the Swiss company Omni Holdings. He said talks 
were continuing with other possible overseas investors whom he declined to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneur has also laid off six people, including three marketing employees 
and three clerical workers, Shea said. The company now employs 61 full-time 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten more involved in the day-to-day operations, and we looked at the 
overhead and decided we were a little top-heavy," Shea said in explaining 
Thain's departure. 
</P>
<P>
But Thain said Tuesday that he left because of a disagreement over "the 
direction the magazine was taking." He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shea said the cutbacks would not affect growth at Entrepreneur and the 
company's two other publications, New Business Opportunities and the recently 
launched Entrepreneurial Woman. 
</P>
<P>
Shea acknowledged earlier this month that fast-growing Entrepreneur had 
encountered some cash-flow problems and that it was late in paying more than $1 
million owed to three suppliers. But he denied that the cash pinch threatened 
the company's future. Shea said Tuesday that about $500,000 of the outstanding 
bills had been paid off in the last several weeks. "We're within 60 days on all 
our payments," he said. "Our creditors are happy." 
</P>
<P>
The creditors, including World Color Press of Los Angeles, Corinthian 
Communications of Corona del Mar and Horizon Paper Co. of New York, have 
declined comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shea has said that the company can continue to grow without a cash 
infusion from a partner, some analysts view the fact that he is in talks about 
possible joint ventures as an indication that the firm's problems are serious.

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' AT OCC SPEAKS WITH A LIKABLE SOUTHERN ACCENT

"Steel Magnolias" can be a mawkish visit to familiar Southern terrain, a 
sentimental play built on personality and predictability. But, if you give it 
rope, it can also persuade with a gabby charm that makes for a pleasantly 
uncomplicated experience. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is what director John Ferzacca is after at Orange Coast College. His 
production, tackled by a cast with more experience than in most campus 
stagings, has a down-home accessibility that makes the most out of Robert 
Harling's personable script -- all the Southern flavoring is pretty quaint but 
still likable. 
</P>
<P>
Harling based his play on personal experience, and the events have a feel of 
closely observed details that affected him deeply. Because of this, it's not 
too difficult to be moved by M'Lynn's pain when daughter Shelby's tragedy 
escalates and "Magnolias" takes a serious turn. Susan O'Connell's performance 
as the mother and Judy Anderson's as Shelby help; both are able to keep the 
emotional backwash from swamping the production's sensible side. 
</P>
<P>
Before this trauma is explored, Harling presents us with several other 
relationships, all between local women who congregate at the beauty shop in a 
small Louisiana town to give support, get catty with their neighbors and each 
other and, all in all, reflect on the day as they see it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a colorful group (when are Southerners ever portrayed as ordinary 
citizens?): Truvy (Kathy Collins) runs the parlor and dispenses bits of 
cosmetic wisdom, such as, "There is no such thing as natural beauty." Clairee 
(Bettie Muellenberg) loves high school football and is thinking about buying a 
radio station. Ouiser (Lorraine McWilliams) is a little cranky and owns a weird 
dog. Annelle (Christy Craven) is Truvy's simple, spacey born-again assistant. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting ground for these ladies, David Scaglione has built a large 
(probably too large for this small town) representation of a beauty shop with 
all the amenities. It's well-made, down to the sit-down hair dryers against the 
wall. Eric Person's costumes are as bold as the characters who wear them. 
</P>
<P>

Ten local arts groups have been added to the roster of the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, it was announced Tuesday, completing the projected programming 
schedule for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The $17.6-million facility, formerly called the Irvine Theatre, is under 
construction on the UC Irvine campus and is expected to open in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of performance dates has been given to five dance companies, 
two drama troupes and three cultural organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known is Ballet Pacifica, which is based in Laguna Beach and has 
appeared throughout Orange County. (Related story, F3.) It will present four 
ballets -- "Eight Lines," "Duetto," "Interior" and a new work still to be 
decided -- on April 12 and 13. A second program on May 31 and June 1 will 
feature "Graduation Ball" and "Les Femmes." 
</P>
<P>
The other dance companies are the Arpana Dance Co., which will stage a 
full-length production with about two dozen Asian Indian dancers (Nov. 23); the 
Irvine Ballet, which will present a holiday program (Dec. 14-16) and a 
children's production (March 1 and 2); the Irvine School of Dance (June 9), and 
the Irvine Academy of Performing Arts (June 20-22). 
</P>
<P>
The drama troupes scheduled for performances are the Irvine Civic Light Opera 
(formerly South Coast Musical Theatre) and the Irvine Valley Theatrefaire for 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
The light-opera company will present two musicals still to be decided. The 
first will run for two weekends (Feb. 15-17 and 22, 23) and the second will run 
for two weekends (July 12-14, 19 and 20). Theatrefaire is considering 
performances of "Beauty and the Beast" on March 15-17, 22 and 23. 
</P>
<P>

(Feb. 3), the Friends of Jewish Music (March 24) and the South Coast Chinese 
Cultural Assn. (May 4).

JANN BROWNE TAKES CROWD AROUND A COUNTRY BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Playing a milestone show for her home-county fans, Jann Browne gave them a tour 
through her real neighborhood -- the precincts of traditional country music -- 
with the assurance of someone who knows her way around every corner on the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's two shows Monday night at the Crazy Horse Steak House marked the 
opening of her first national tour as a headliner in her own right (the Laguna 
Hills singer did two years of road work with Asleep at the Wheel in the early 
1980s). The occasion also marked a rite of passage of sorts: Browne's first 
time headlining in one of the weekly slots that Orange County's highest-profile 
honky-tonk reserves for touring attractions. 
</P>
<P>
With her debut album, "Tell Me Why," having spent more than two months on the 
country charts (two singles have hit the Top 20), Browne has finally gone 
national after more than a decade of dues-paying on the Southern California 
scene. From the intensity of the cheers, a good many fans at the upscale Crazy 
Horse show were longtime partisans who had seen her in grass-roots bars like 
the Swallows Inn in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Browne wasn't about to let the evening drift away on a wave of graduation-night 
sentimentality, though. Instead, she played a direct, unpretentious show 
(Browne's lone frill was a fancy, tight-fitting black velvet stage suit), 
thanking the home fans for giving her a foundation, but correctly reasoning 
that she could reward them best with songs instead of extensive reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's material and performing style don't, at this point, herald a singer 
able to put a thoroughly individual stamp on traditional country music. Even 
performers who relish tradition need to have a healthy willingness to turn it 
on its head once in a while, or to make old traditions serve new themes and 
tales. But Browne's 70-minute early show established that she is a rounded, 
seasoned, confident talent with first-rate ability. She was like a 
well-trained, superbly conditioned Olympic diver or gymnast who can handle each 
compulsory maneuver with aplomb. The set ranged through just about every 
classic subgenre in the country tradition, showing a knowing way with each of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
There were aching ballads, made vivid with a controlled, ever-so-slight crack 
in the voice and a keening climactic cry. There was wry honky-tonk, where 
lyrics about heartbreaks bounce along over jaunty rhythms as if to say all 
those sad affairs are just a part of the human comedy. There were clattering 
train-rhythms, chunky rocking country, a prettily sighing country-Mex 
combination and a strong, quick-stepping bluegrass tune. 
</P>
<P>
In each setting, Browne's backup group was a sharp, interlocking unit. The key 
soloists were guitarist Rick MacDonald and jack-of-all-strings Dennis 
Caplinger, who wove lovely fiddle, mandolin and lap-slide guitar accents into 
the music, and plunked a bit of banjo to boot. Rhythm guitarist Lonnie Allen's 
clear, chiming tone also played a prominent part in the mix. Drummer Rhys 
Clark, a transplanted New Zealander living in Huntington Beach, gave every song 
sure definition, while bassist Don Whaley shaded Browne's singing with good 
harmony vocals. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from her material's too-close adherence to traditional conventions, there 
was little to quarrel with in Browne's performance. One might argue with the 
emotional cast she gave "Louisville," an original song in which a woman travels 
two-thirds of the way across the country to make a new life with a lover, only 
to be stood up and left stranded and broke. Browne sang it with plaintive, hurt 
restraint, when the situation seems to call for the most outraged, withering 
kiss-off a singer could muster. 
</P>
<P>
She finished her set hot and strong with a new song, "Blue Heart in Memphis." 
It rocked authoritatively as Browne's voice conveyed the sense of risk and 
abandon with which people follow their dreams in a music mecca -- even after 
their initial hopes have foundered. 
</P>
<P>
But that was only a warm-up for the encore rendition of "Will the Circle Be 
Unbroken?" Browne and her band made the hoary bluegrass-gospel warhorse sound 
coltish again. The band goosed it with rockabilly rhythms, then veered into 
gleeful Western swing. Browne, meanwhile, swung right along, wailing in a black 
soul-gospel voice as playful and irreverent as a moonshine party in the church 
basement. It ended the show with a big exclamation point and hinted at what 
Browne might be able to do if she will try to twist and contort country 
traditions once in a while instead of retracing the music's classic outlines.

Nelson Mandela took New York City by storm today, riding up Broadway in a 
bulletproof glass "greenhouse" as a sea of confetti rained down and hundreds of 
thousands of New Yorkers cheered and shouted, "Keep the pressure up!" 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary outpouring of goodwill delighted the 71-year-old Mandela, who 
arrived weary and reportedly feeling faint from an exhausting world tour aimed 
at keeping up the pressure on white-ruled South Africa to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The South African black nationalist leader declared that he knew he had friends 
in New York but never dreamed he was so loved. His weariness seemed to melt 
away amid the cheers.

Mandela arrived with a message of hope. In prison for 27 years until February 
and still unable to vote in his own country, the deputy president of the 
African National Congress declared that he can now see "light at the end of the 
tunnel" for an end to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic mosaic of New York paraded in front of him as he made his way up 
Manhattan's "Canyon of Heroes" -- the traditional parade route for a hero's 
welcome here -- in the "Mandelamobile" specially designed to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
Set on a blue flatbed truck it looked like a greenhouse or even a 
picture-windowed guardhouse. It was a far cry from the open car used in past 
ticker-tape parades by such figures as aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh 
and the astronauts who went to the moon and a clear sign of the nervousness of 
a security-conscious era. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-foot-long papier-mache Chinese dragon snaked its way up lower Broadway to 
welcome Mandela, followed by Irish bagpipers, American Indian dancers, South 
Korean drummers, Kurdish dancers, Formosans, Jews, Arabs, Italians, Ethiopians, 
African-Americans and Polish marchers to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds were 10 and 12 deep on the sidewalks. The cheering was non-stop. A sea 
of confetti, ticker tape, streamers and even toilet rolls rained down on the 
parade. Some of the signs used to hail Mandela were clearly used before. On the 
back of one sign denouncing apartheid was a demand that Britain leave Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day for vendors selling buttons with Mandela's photograph, his name 
and his cause. "Free Man -- Nelson Mandela" and "Free at Last" were but two 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was joyous and unrestrained in its enthusiasm. Mandela waved and 
flashed a broad, open smile as he sat next to his wife, Winnie, and New York 
State Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and New York Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city's first 
black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
People perched on the tops of skycrapers and in windows for a glimpse of the 
extraordinary scene. There was so much confetti thrown that it looked as if New 
York had a snowstorm in June.

ACCUSES ARAFAT OF NOT CONDEMNING RAID ON ISRAEL BEACH;

<P>
President Bush today suspended an 18-month dialogue with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, saying Yasser Arafat's group had failed to forcefully 
condemn an unsuccessful terrorist attack on an Israeli beach. 
</P>
<P>
Making clear he was taking the step reluctantly and considers Palestinian 
participation vital to a Middle East peace settlement, Bush said he nonetheless 
felt compelled to set aside controversial U.S. contacts with Arafat's group for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to suspend the dialogue between the United States and the PLO 
pending a satisfactory response from the PLO of steps it is taking to resolve 
problems associated with the recent acts of terrorism," Bush said at a news 
conference during a one-day visit to Alabama and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO reacted harshly, saying Bush's decision was a provocation and it would 
ask Arab states to impose economic sanctions on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Jamil Hilal, director of the PLO's information department in Tunis, told 
Reuters the suspension of the dialogue was "an unfriendly and provocative act. 
It will be seen as a blow to the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy in Washington immediately hailed the move as one that would 
promote prospects for peace. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush said in discussing his decision: "We believe that Palestinian 
participation is vital to any successful (peace) process. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy call. . . . I just feel that talking offers more potential 
than stiff-arming each other. And yet we can't digest it as long as this 
terroristic act is sticking in our throat." 
</P>
<P>
The event that forced the U.S. hand was an attempted raid by members of a 
radical PLO faction against Israeli beaches on May 30. Israeli security forces 
foiled the raid and Israel claimed that this was an example of how the PLO 
remained committed to terrorism despite its public statements to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
The United States resumed diplomatic contacts with the PLO in December, 1988, 
after a 15-year interruption, once Arafat publicly forswore terrorism as a PLO 
policy and recognized Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the U.S.-PLO dialogue could resume only after the PLO had condemned 
the May 30 raid and disciplined Abu Abbas, the leader of the radical faction 
that claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro 
in which American passenger Leon Klinghoffer was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue. To date the PLO has 
not given a credible accounting of this incident," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time the PLO is prepared to take the necessary steps, we are prepared to 
promptly resume the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said U.S. contacts with the PLO had been beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he was pleased that the PLO had distanced itself from the May 30 
assault, although without explicitly condemning it, and had issued a statement 
condemning attacks on civilians. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "This alone is not sufficient."

The nation's second-largest tobacco company today agreed not to run ads 
misrepresenting the results of studies linking smoking and health problems, the 
Federal Trade Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the maker of more than 20 
cigarette brands including Winston, Camel and Salem, was in response to an FTC 
complaint that Reynolds made false and misleading claims about a smoking study 
funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, a federal health 
agency based in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the latest in a series of setbacks for Reynolds. In the past 
18 months, it has dropped plans for several new cigarette brands, under 
pressure from the government or consumer groups or both.

A North Korean woman who placed a time bomb on a Korean Air jetliner in 1987 
that disappeared with 115 people aboard said today she still feels guilty and 
punishes herself by not buying all the dresses she wants. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Hyon Hui, 28, convicted of the atrocity and given a death sentence that was 
later commuted, met with reporters at a Seoul hotel, looking healthy and 
well-heeled in a blue dress. 
</P>
<P>
"As a woman, as a human being, I have the same desires as others," Kim said in 
a soft voice. "There are many things I want to have and there are many dresses 
I would like to wear. But because of my position I restrain myself." 
</P>
<P>
Kim, a beauty who created a sensation in South Korea during her trial, said she 
spends her days watching television but she does go shopping at times with her 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kim has been living in a government house with women guards who allow 
her freedom of movement, she said she still feels she is a captive. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a culprit I do have a sense of agony with which I must fight," she said. 
"In that sense I must still be a prisoner or a captive -- of a sense of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she has thought of marrying, Kim replied, "I am guilty of a 
heinous crime. How do I dare to think of marriage?" 
</P>
<P>
Kim and an elderly North Korean man boarded a KAL airliner at Baghdad, Iraq, 
the night of Nov. 28, 1987. The pair got off the plane three hours later when 
it stopped over at Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, leaving behind a time 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
The plane vanished over Southeast Asia while heading to Bangkok, Thailand, en 
route to Seoul. It is believed to have crashed in the ocean, killing the 115 
people on board. 
</P>
<P>
Kim and her companion were arrested and he committed suicide.

Lech Walesa said in an interview today that he doesn't want to but "will have

political war against his former Solidarity allies. 
</P>
<P>
The union leader challenged the longtime intellectual allies in Warsaw who are 
opposing him to start a separate "center-left" political party and not hide 
behind the broad label of Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to be president. (But) I will have to be president," Walesa said 
in the interview in Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest newspaper, whose use of 
the Solidarity logo Walesa disputes.

<P>
Walesa announced that he plans to start a daily newspaper owned by the

House voted today to override President Bush's veto of a bill that would lift a 
50-year-old ban on partisan political activity by federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
The House re-passed the bill on a 327-93 vote and sent it to the Senate where 
supporters also were trying to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override 
the President's veto. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, which originally passed the bill on a 67-30 vote, was scheduled to 
take up the veto Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow 3 million federal workers to take part in nearly all 
political activities, except running for public office on a partisan ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's disapproval of the Hatch Act bill was his 12th veto and Congress so far 
has been unable to override any of them. A 13th veto is expected shortly when 
he sends back the recently passed family medical leave bill.

Florida's former top tax collector pleaded no contest today to a charge of 
attempted official misconduct and was sentenced to a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Tucker also agreed to pay $500 in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
She resigned from her job as state Revenue Department director in February in 
the face of certain dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge F. E. Steinmeyer III modified the probation to allow Tucker, 46, 
to carry out her duties as a reserve officer in the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker had been charged with misconduct by falsifying documents, a third-degree 
felony that carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. The misdemeanor charge 
to which she pleaded no contest could have meant a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The charge stemmed from a state investigation into whether she had singled out 
the businesses owned by Donald G. Resha for auditing. Resha lost a 1985 race 
for the presidency of the state AFL-CIO to Tucker's husband.

INSURER JUMPS SHIP ON TRUMP'S PLAN FOR WORLD'S BIGGEST YACHT

A Dutch insurer has pulled out of a plan to build the world's biggest and most 
luxurious yacht for Donald Trump because it has lost faith in the troubled 
casino and real estate tycoon. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for NCM, which protects firms against defaulting creditors, said 
today it has canceled contracts with several companies involved in the 
construction of the Trump Princess II. 
</P>
<P>
The 420-foot yacht, worth about $200 million, is being built in a small 
shipyard in the northern Dutch fishing village of Makkum. 
</P>
<P>
"We have withdrawn because we received unfavorable information about Trump's 
financial position. We no longer have confidence in him," the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, saddled with debts estimated at $3 billion, is struggling to raise $60 
million in fresh loans to maintain his property and casino empire. 
</P>
<P>
Work began on his new yacht in November. Dutch newspapers said Trump's aim was 
to possess the biggest and most luxurious private yacht in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In April Trump bought the shipyard, Amsel Holland BV, from British investment 
group CTS Ltd. to ensure the success of his project. But this month he ordered 
work on the yacht to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the delay was due to Trump's financial woes, Amsel's financial 
controller Andries Bosma said: "No. It was because of technical problems." 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know when work would resume.

LANVIN'S FEISTY CHIEF QUITTING ON HEELS OF DESIGNER BOO-BOO

<P>
The chairman of French fashion house Lanvin, who kicked up a storm when he 
unleashed radical designer Claude Montana on the conservative world of haute 
couture, announced today he is quitting. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said that Leon Bressler will hand in his resignation after the 
July shows. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Midland Bank bought a stake in Lanvin in March, 1989, and Bressler 
was brought in from the bank's French branch to revamp the fading fortunes of 
Jeanne Lanvin's fashion house. 
</P>
<P>
His most controversial decision was to ask Montana, one of Paris' most 
influential and modernistic designers, to take over the house's individually 
tailored haute couture line. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's much-trumpeted first collection, which made no attempt to mimic the 
smart little suits usually favored by high-fashion stylists, was panned by 
critics, who accused Bressler of making a major tactical mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Bressler's long-term future at Lanvin appeared in doubt in February when 
Midland sold Lanvin to Orcofi, a French holding company controlled by the 
leather goods family business Vuitton. 
</P>
<P>
The former managing director of rival house Chanel, Michel Pietrini, is widely 
being cited as Bressler's successor, but the spokeswoman could not confirm his 
nomination.

Stock prices were mixed today in the third straight day of light trading 
although the Dow eked out a small gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials increased 1.74 to 2,895.30. Broader 
indexes were down. The Dow average of 20 transportations was down 1.82 at 
1,177.01 and the average of 15 utilities was down 0.38 at 208.56.

Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 667 up, 767 down and 559 unchanged.

Big Board volume totaled 137.42 million shares, against 134.93 million in the

The NYSE's composite index rose 0.23 to 195.84. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 0.02 to 360.81. 
</P>
<P>
A midday report from the Federal Reserve that predicted slower economic growth 
and little change in inflation sent prices down quickly in the early afternoon. 
The report contained few surprises, but moved the waffling market. 
</P>
<P>
"A little bit of news one way or another can turn this thing," Alan Ackerman, 
senior vice president and market strategist at Gruntal &amp; Co, said. 
Investors have been groping for the slightest signal of where interest rates 
are headed, market watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day stock prices began to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors, also apparently concerned about corporate profits, have sat 
out. Volume has been down to what Walter Murphy, senior market specialist at 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., called "bordering on abysmal." 
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors have also apparently been sitting out, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a period of marking time and waiting for things to happen," said Edwin 
Kantor, chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the continued belief 
that the Federal Reserve would not ease monetary policy soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 3/32 point, or 94 cents per 
$1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, 
increased to 8.48% from 8.47% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were unchanged to up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities ranged from 1/32 point 
lower to 1/32 point higher and long-term issues were down 1/16 point, according 
to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.

BUSH HELD 'ANEMIC' IN S&amp;L CRACKDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
CITIZEN GROUP HITS SLOWNESS TO ACT ON 'BUCCANEER' THRIFTS

A public interest group stoked the political furor over the savings and loan 
crisis today, saying the Bush Administration's efforts to crack down on fraud 
in the savings and loan industry has been "anemic at best, irresponsible at 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
"The original S&amp;L calamity is now being compounded, every day, by the 
Administration's failure to bring law and order to the nation's financial 
industry," said Michael Waldman, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, founded by Ralph Nader, released a report detailing the 
widespread fraud in the thrift industry and the efforts of the Administration 
to bring those responsible to justice. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless a real crackdown begins against these buccaneer bankers, this financial 
crime wave will be fully subsidized by average taxpayers," Waldman said. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the thrift industry is expected to cost taxpayers anywhere from 
$132 billion to $500 billion, making it the worst financial debacle since the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L fraud have been 
anemic at best, irresponsible at worst," said Sherry Ettleson, a Public Citizen 
staff attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, which launched an ambitious program last year to rescue the 
savings industry, has been harshly criticized for the slowness of its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The White House and Congress aggressively traded charges today over who should 
take responsibility for the industry's collapse. Presidential spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said the Administration is perfectly willing to turn debate over the 
crisis into a campaign issue, saying, "We're ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is scheduled to give a speech about the savings and loan 
industry on Friday at the Justice Department. All 93 U.S. attorneys nationwide 
have been summoned to attend by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has come under criticism for the slow pace of thrift 
failure prosecutions and the White House is concerned that the Democrats are 
turning the massive taxpayer bailout into a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorneys will have "an ongoing discussion of S&amp;L prosecutions," 
Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said. They will be "sharing 
information, sharing investigative techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicolas F. Brady also will attend. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is wrestling with a growing backlog of unaddressed 
thrift fraud cases. According to the Public Citizen report, the department was 
actively pursuing only 891 cases of the nearly 7,000 referrals and complaints 
received as of February.

PENTAGON BACKS SEVERANCE PAY FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL

<P>
The Pentagon, facing the prospect of laying off enlisted personnel, endorsed 
the idea today of severance pay for soldiers thrown out of work as the U.S. 
military shrinks in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Four senior enlisted men told a Senate Armed Services personnel subcommittee 
that some sort of payment is the top priority for members of the Army, Navy, 
Air Force and Marines who may lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2 million men and women in U.S. uniforms, and Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney has estimated that 2% annual cuts in spending over the 
next five years would cut the force by 425,000. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, "separation pay" is given to officers ordered out before reaching 
the 20-year point when they become eligible to retire and draw retirement pay. 
The program allows a payment of 10% of basic pay, multiplied by years of 
service, up to a maximum of $30,000.

Talk show host Larry King is asking fans "to go to bat for the Babe" in a fund 
drive to expand the Babe Ruth Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"These are exciting times for baseball fans. Starting today we're going to 
offer fans across the country membership to the Babe Ruth Museum," King said 
Tuesday behind the house where the Sultan of Swat was born 95 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can count on all of you to go to bat for the Babe." 
</P>
<P>
The museum hopes a broadened membership will pay for a 12,000-square-foot 
addition, including a 6,000-square-foot auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was built in 1974 around the birthplace of George Herman (Babe) 
Ruth.

SALVO ON LONGBOX CD PACKAGING

In response to some consumer outrage directed at compact disc packaging, an 
environmental group is encouraging consumers to remove the "longbox" packaging 
after purchase and leave the empty carton at the store. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ban the Box Coalition said today the action is intended to 
force retailers to contend with the mounting, non-recyclable waste generated by 
the 6-by-12-inch paperboard and blister pack containers. 
</P>
<P>
Ban the Box estimates that 250 million CDs will be sold in the United States 
this year, generating more than 23 million pounds of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer action is the latest volley in the battle against the CD 
packaging. In May, the recording group Raffi refused to renew its contract with 
MCA until the record company agreed not to place any of the groups's CDs in 
longbox packaging.

The Ferris wheel at an amusement park turns riderless in the wind. And the eyes 
of children stare unknowingly at a cameraman whose free hand holds a Geiger 
counter registering off the scale. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the photo exhibit of Igor Kostin, the first Soviet photographer on 
the scene of the April 26, 1986, explosion at the Chernobyl power plant, are 
greeted by the images of burn victims, rescue workers and the contaminated 
rubble. It is a testament to the world's worst nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely not art," said Kostin, a 53-year-old industrial designer 
turned photographer. "It can't be a piece of art because it was such a terrible 
thing. It's a historical tragedy for our people and a warning for other people 
that this could happen anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Kostin was in Baltimore to kick off the U.S. tour of his exhibit, "Chernobyl: 
Not to Be Forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 black and white and color photos are arranged in chronological order, 
beginning with the destroyed building of Reactor 4, the arrival of rescue 
workers and nuclear power officials and the cleanup operation, and ending with 
more recent photos of the Chernobyl trial, protests in Kiev, residents who 
either have refused to leave the 18-mile danger zone or are awaiting government 
relocation, and deformed animals and contaminated crops in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit ends with a brief photocopied statement from Kostin: "When I think 
back, it seems as if it were yesterday. I can hear the noise of the helicopter 
and I can see the people who had to leave their homes taking with them only a 
cat or a kitchen pot as they fled from the danger. Then I think, 'Did it all 
really happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kostin, who lives in Kiev, about 60 miles from the plant, continues to return 
to the danger zone despite the health risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there the first time because I just had to see with my own eyes, and I 
took my camera so other people could see," said Kostin, a photographer with the 
Soviet news agency Novosti. "I go back now because it is a magnet drawing me. 
Someone has to continue to go back into the affected area, to show the world 
that there are still people living there, to show that it never should have 
happened and that it must never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Kostin said the government has been cooperative in allowing him to show the 
photographs and to travel with the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago I couldn't even think about this," he said. "I'm happy to live 
at a time when I can show what I've done and can tell what I have to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the exhibit, which has a $1 entry fee, will help establish the 
Igor Kostin Fund for Children of Chernobyl, said Susu Erca of the Italian firm 
sponsoring the exhibit. The fund will go toward medical supplies for hospitals 
within the danger zone.

MIDNIGHT OIL FIRMLY FILLS WHO'S SHOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Meet the new boss, not quite the same as the old boss. 
</P>
<P>
The rock pinata is stuffed nowadays with bands struggling to evoke the Beatles 
or trying to be the new Stones, but hardly anyone seems interested in being the 
new Who, with all the passion, bravado, bluster and sheer intellect that would 
entail. 
</P>
<P>
Filling those estimable shoes quite nicely -- and without really trying -- is 
Midnight Oil, the world-class rock 'n' roll band from Australia that headlined 
the first of two nights Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre with a 
near-faultless show exceeded in its tugging sense of commitment only by its 
viscerally overwhelming, finely detailed musical drive. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the answer to who's next. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to be among friends," announced singer Peter Garrett -- not your 
average giant bald left-wing Christian environmentalist hard-rock former 
political candidate -- between edgy encore renditions of John Lennon's "Instant 
Karma" and Nick Lowe's "Peace, Love and Understanding." 
</P>
<P>
He explained, in the same earnest tones used to pitch the whale-saving and 
anti-apartheid tables in the lobby, "We have a common understanding . . . 
mistrust of Milli Vanilli." 
</P>
<P>
Among the quite rousing songs played Tuesday: "Stars of Warburton," 
"Warakurna," "Kosciusko." Among the themes addressed: aboriginal rights and 
outback strip mining. Clearly, this is not a band obsessed with Stateside 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
The relentless punch with which Oil put across its songs in the late '70s and 
early '80s -- when the band was playing the Hollywood Palladium and 
slam-dancing audiences were the norm -- made the Clash the closest point of 
reference. These days, though, they relent now and again, and few of the songs 
from the group's two latest albums -- which accounted for 14 of the 17 original 
selections Tuesday -- mandate a slam response. 
</P>
<P>
The Who comparison is much more apt now, and not just because Garrett did a 
fleeting windmill motion while miming during a guitar solo. The pace is more 
moderate on most of their newer songs, and nuances of melody and timekeeping 
have become far more important. The three-piece horn section used on a few 
choice numbers -- borrowed from the opening act, fellow Aussies Hunters &amp; 
Collectors -- recalled the heights of the Who's "Quadrophenia" era. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, of course, is no Roger Daltrey: He calmly and wittily plugs 
environmental causes during the breaks (not to mention some SDI- and 
Bush-bashing), then erupts in a fury of rigid motion during the songs, like a 
cross between Joe Cocker and Robocop. 
</P>
<P>
He's both smoothly articulate and unpredictably galvanized; his band is precise 
and musically refined but positively rips. It's rock in an advanced 
evolutionary state that indeed made the Milli Vanillis of the world seem like 
crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
A complete review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.

THE HOT SKINNY free-floating over Atlantic City and the Isle of Manhattan has 
it that Donald Trump went to his father, Fred, a man who is a success story in 
his own right. Donald asked to borrow money for the current unpleasantness. 
Papa Fred is said to have answered he'd lend on one condition -- Donald must 
reconcile with Ivana! 
</P>
<P>
Is this true? Well, it's what insiders say, though I wouldn't expect either 
Trump the Elder or Trump the Younger to confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
MARLA MAPLES shot her first commercial for No Excuses jeans in an idyllic 
country setting Tuesday in Connecticut. She has decided she really wants to 
make her life in New York and is now expressing an interest in a singing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Can Marla sing? She says she can and that she inherited the talent from her 
dear father. 
</P>
<P>
THE CURRENT craze for big occasions is to make a video tribute for the subject 
being honored by having best pals, family, and the famous or infamous say a few 
words. The Donald Trump 44th birthday celebration in Atlantic City last weekend 
was no exception and one who gave Donald a friendly needle was the 
controversial comic Andrew Dice Clay. 
</P>
<P>
Trump reportedly hopes to put Clay into one of his big entertainment rooms on 
the Jersey shore. But some who were at the party, attended by Fred Trump, 
skipped out of the room during Clay's diatribe. They said it was "Soooo 
vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Donald's splendid mother, Mary, was not there; she is recovering 
from a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
ABC won lots of nice publicity from its affiliates meeting last week in Los 
Angeles, with dignified and welcome pronouncements, such as the fact that David 
Brinkley is staying on. (Thank goodness!) 
</P>
<P>
But what the network also garnered was lots of unexpected, unwanted, 
undignified laughter from the affiliate honchos when they saw a sneak preview 
of "Cop Rock." This is the new dramatic musical series from the gifted "L.A. 
Law" and "Hill Street Blues" creator Steve Bochco. Actors actually break right 
into song in the middle of this epic about cops. And those who have seen it, 
can't believe what they saw -- and heard. 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY SILLS has a new job; she will write at least three articles a year for 
McCall's dealing with her zest for life and her very interesting opinions. Yes, 
she can write. too.

Another option, said Robert Sweazy, Tech's faculty representative to the SWC,

Arkansas announced Tuesday that it will listen to an offer to join the SEC, and

"I am like an orange without any juice," she said. "The determination is not

TWO HITS RAISE DYKSTRA'S AVERAGE TO .384

<TEXT>
<P>
Len Dykstra, the major leagues' leading batter, raised his average to .384 with 
two hits, and scored three times, sparking the Philadelphia Phillies to a 7-2 
victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates today. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra was 2 for 3, with two walks and two stolen bases, as the Phillies 
handed the East Division-leading Pirates their third straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Herr drove in three runs and Bruce Ruffin allowed five hits over eight 
innings. Dickie Thon, playing on his 32nd birthday, hit his second homer of the 
year in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin (5-6) struck out seven and walked three before being relieved by Roger 
McDowell, who pitched a hitless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates' Bobby Bonilla hit his 16th homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
At Detroit, Oakland's Bob Welch won his eighth consecutive game and Terry 
Steinbach had six RBIs with a grand slam and a single today as the Athletics 
beat the Tigers 12-7 to avoid their first sweep of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire had a two-run homer for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The loss cost the Tigers a chance to reach .500 for the first time since the 
end of the 1988. Detroit hasn't swept a three-game series from Oakland since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Welch (11-2), who hasn't lost since May 5, gave up two runs on six hits in six 
innings to tie Boston's Roger Clemens for the American League lead in wins. 
Welch's last eight-game winning streak was in 1985 while pitching for the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
For Oakland, Dennis Eckersley pitched a hitless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After getting a second opinion on his injured right shoulder, New York Yankees 
pitcher Pascual Perez might be able to avoid season-ending arthroscopic 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery will be delayed for at least three weeks so Perez, who signed a 
$5.7-million, three-year contract as a free agent during the off-season, can 
try more rest and rehabilitation, the New York Times and New York Post reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was examined by Dr. James Andrews, an orthopedic surgeon, in Birmingham, 
Ala., on Tuesday. Andrews agreed with Yankees team physician Dr. Stuart Hershon 
that Perez has a chronic inflammation in the rear of the shoulder joint. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews suggested that Perez, who last pitched for the Yankees on April 25, 
rest the shoulder for three weeks and then begin throwing in a rehabilitation 
program. Hershon and Dr. Louis Bigliani, an orthopedist and shoulder specialist 
at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, had recommended surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was 1-2 with a 1.29 earned run average in three starts for the Yankees.

RILEY TAKES HIS 'SHOWTIME' TO NBC; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: NETWORK HIRES FORMER LAKERS COACH AS HOST OF PREGAME SEGMENT ON 
NBA TELECASTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Pat Riley, who last week announced he was resigning as coach of the Lakers, 
today was hired by NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Riley will serve as the host of the network's pregame shows when it begins 
covering the NBA next season. 
</P>
<P>
After a New York press conference, Riley said for the first time that he 
decided to leave the Lakers in February. 
</P>
<P>
He said that's when he and Lakers owner Jerry Buss first had discussions about 
him resigning. 
</P>
<P>
"We then decided to table those discussions until after the season," Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley again reiterated that the decision to leave the Lakers was his. "You can 
either believe me or not believe me, but it's the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC hiring was expected, but his role as the pregame host is somewhat of a 
surprise. Recent speculation about Riley and NBC centered around his becoming a 
game commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's contract is for four years, the same length as NBC's contract with the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
A source said his NBC salary will be approximately the same as his base salary 
with the Lakers, believed to be less than $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, said the network's NBA game 
commentators will be announced later. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility is Chuck Daly, coach of the NBA champion Detroit Pistons. 
Ebersol said an offer has been made. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck will be visiting the White House with the Pistons tomorrow," Ebersol 
said. "We wanted to wait until he was done with all obligations with the 
Pistons before we asked him for a decision." 
</P>
<P>
NBC has openings for two commentators. One would work with Marv Albert, the 
other with Bob Costas. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, asked why he will be doing studio work instead of game analysis, touched 
his hair and quipped, "By working in the studio, I won't mess up this hairdo." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said discussions with Ebersol and Terry O'Neil, the network's 
executive producer, led him in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
Riley will appear on NBC's "Late Night With David Letterman" tonight and then 
leave for a Mediterranean cruise. 
</P>
<P>
He will then attend the Wimbledon tennis championships in England as a guest of 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
His first NBC assignment will be the McDonald's Open Oct. 13 in Barcelona, 
Spain. The four-team tournament involves NBA and European players. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's first regular-season assignment for NBC will be Nov. 3.

U.S. SOCCER: WHERE DOES THE WORLD CUP TEAM GO FROM HERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
FLORENCE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the 22 players who represented the United States in its first World Cup 
soccer appearance in 40 years returned home today. They left with a wealth of 
experience and experiences, but also with three losses in three games. 
</P>
<P>
The post-mortem: 
</P>
<P>
Question: Was the team's performance better or worse than expected? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Both. Although the United States did not play as well as it expected, 
it was better than the rest of the world thought when the tournament began. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the odds against it established by London bookmakers, the United States 
was not the worst of the 24 teams. That distinction belonged to the United Arab 
Emirates. The United States also scored two goals, which is two more than most 
people predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Was Bob Gansler the right man to coach the team? 
</P>
<P>
A: If the United States actually expected to realize its goal of advancing to 
the second round, the answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
Having never attended a World Cup game, not even as a spectator, Gansler did 
not have his team psychologically prepared for the opening game against 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
He watched the Czechs play numerous games on film and once in person. He was 
unimpressed, believing that his team could finish that game with a tie or maybe 
even a victory. 
</P>
<P>
But he was surprised that the Czechs were able to raise their intensity level 
to such a high degree for the World Cup. As a result, so were his overconfident 
players. They were overwhelmed in a 5-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should Gansler be retained as the coach for the 1994 World Cup in the United 
States? 
</P>
<P>
A: Definitely. Now that he has a World Cup behind him, the United States should 
not waste his experience. He is a thoughtful, intelligent coach who learns from 
his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game he proved to the world that he can coach. His strategy and 
his players' ability to implement it contained Italy to a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who were the most impressive players? 
</P>
<P>
A: Midfielder Tab Ramos of Hillside, N.J., and defender John Doyle of Fremont, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The team's most skilled player, Ramos might emerge with a contract in the Dutch 
first division. At only 5 feet, 7 inches and 140 pounds, he can be knocked off 
the ball too easily to continue in his role as a play maker. But he might be 
effective as an active forward. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the scale at 6-3 and 185, Doyle proved he could hold his 
own with the strongest forwards. Italy's Andrea Carnevale and Austria's Toni 
Polster were benched during games against the United States because they were 
ineffective against Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will the team still be together for the 1994 World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are a U.S. soccer fan, you can only hope the answer is no. As the 
youngest team in the tournament with an average age of 24.2 years, the United 
States has some players who will just be reaching their prime in four years. 
But the United States must have players who are better athletically and 
technically if it intends to advance beyond the first round. That was the most 
important lesson learned from this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can it find those players? 
</P>
<P>
A: It has some on this team who might be able to raise their games to the 
necessary level. 
</P>
<P>
Three reserves, midfielders Chris Henderson and Neil Covone and goalkeeper 
Kasey Keller, are young enough to play on the under-23 team, which will begin 
its attempt later this year to qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics. That will 
give them additional international experience. 
</P>
<P>
Other players may have opportunities to play in European professional leagues. 
Unfortunately, players who do not have those opportunities have little chance 
to improve. 
</P>
<P>
For college players who are not members of national teams, their seasons are 
too short. 
</P>
<P>
For older players, there is no professional outdoor soccer league in the United 
States that enables them to make a living. The American Professional Soccer 
League has a salary cap of $75,000 per team, which means no player earns more 
than about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
One solution would be a legitimate professional league, but the U.S. Soccer 
Federation still does not have a plan, two years after it announced that it 
would develop one. 
</P>
<P>
At least through the end of this year, the federation plans to maintain a 
national team that will play an extensive schedule, beginning July 28 in 
Milwaukee against East Germany. But Gansler calls that concept over a four-year 
period "a traveling Gypsy band that will drive the players and me insane." 
</P>
<P>
Most important, however, the federation must reach out to more players. Most of 
its talent pool consists of white, middle-class suburban products of the 
American Youth Soccer Assn. It will not succeed until the Michael Jordans and 
Bo Jacksons are playing soccer.

INJURY SPAWNED CARTER'S CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DAMAGED KNEE FORCED HIM TO ABANDON DREAM OF PLAYING FOOTBALL AT UCLA. 
NOW HE HOLDS NL RECORD.

Gary Carter has caught more games than any player in National League history, 
which is quite a feat for someone who planned a football career. As an 
All-America quarterback at Sunny Hills High in Fullerton, Carter's ambition was 
to run the option for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He might have been the second coming of Gary Beban, but a scrimmage before his 
senior year in 1971 completely altered his life and vaulted him to baseball 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
During that scrimmage against Lynwood High, Carter was hit low and hard, the 
impact snapping the medial collateral ligament in his knee. Not realizing how 
seriously he was hurt, Carter continued to play. When the injury was diagnosed, 
the aspiring quarterback was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
It was a temporary setback. His dreams of football stardom at UCLA were 
shattered, but Tuesday he set a National League record by playing in his 
1,862nd game at catcher. He is enjoying a rebirth with the San Francisco Giants 
and appears headed for the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"A blessing in disguise," Carter says of the injury that forced him to place an 
emphasis on baseball. "Football was by far my best sport in high school. I was 
going to run the UCLA wishbone for Pepper Rodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carter's football plans took a turn for the worse, the Montreal Expos 
never lost faith in the effervescent youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Little Leaguer, I pitched and played all the infield positions," Carter 
said. "I started catching my senior year in high school because my coach and 
the scouts thought I would be a good one. I was drafted in the third round, the 
53rd player selected, and (the Expos) gave me $35,000." 
</P>
<P>
Carter commanded attention with 23 homers and 83 RBI for Triple-A Memphis in 
1974. He reached Montreal later that season and was used frequently as an 
outfielder because the Expos were grooming Barry Foote as their catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Williams took over at Montreal in 1977 and declared that Carter and Foote 
would battle for the catching job. Carter won, of course, and immediately was 
labeled as the next Johnny Bench. 
</P>
<P>
"That was very flattering," Carter says, "because he always was a hero of mine. 
When I went to my first major-league camp in 1975, I wanted to emulate Bench. I 
asked for his No. 5. It wasn't available, so they gave me No. 8. I don't mind. 
It's become my lucky number." 
</P>
<P>
Little did Carter realize that he would catch more games than Bench. The 
broken-down football player is now behind only Bob Boone, Carlton Fisk, Al 
Lopez and Jim Sundberg on the major-league list. Sundberg and Lopez will be 
passed next year if Carter's sudden revival is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
Only a bum knee last year prevented him from tying Bench and Bill Dickey for 
the all-time record of 13 consecutive years catching 100 or more games. Carter 
was limited to 50 games in 1989. This year he has already played in 42 and has 
exceeded his hit and homer totals of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't given the record much thought, but it does show a degree of 
durability," said Carter, who began the week with a .283 average and was 
batting .455 (10 for 22) in a six-game hitting streak.
