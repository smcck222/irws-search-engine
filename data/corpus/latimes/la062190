French President Francois Mitterrand challenged France's Western partners to 
follow Paris' lead in easing Africa's debt burden instead of giving the 
Africans lessons about democracy. In a speech at a Franco-African summit in La 
Baule, France, he announced a symbolic reduction of debt repayments to France 
by four African countries. Mitterrand acknowledged that democratic reform in 
Africa is inevitable, but he cautioned Europe against talking down to Africa.

Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney urged the Manitoba provincial 
legislature to suspend the democratic process and ratify a constitutional 
amendment that could keep Quebec in Canada. A vote on the amendment, which 
gives the provinces greater powers and recognizes French-speaking Quebec as a 
distinct society, has been held up with procedural tactics by an Indian 
legislator. The amendment must be ratified by all 10 provinces by Saturday or 
it becomes null.

Former Teamster leader Rudy Tham was convicted of obstructing justice by trying 
to get U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar to influence the judge who was 
hearing a criminal case against Tham. Aguilar faces a separate trial on the 
same conspiracy charge and four other felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
A jury deadlocked in March in a joint trial of Aguilar, Tham and a third man, 
reputed ex-mobster Abe Chapman. Tham was convicted of conspiracy and 
obstruction of justice stemming from allegations that he sought to have Aguilar 
approach U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel in early 1988 and persuade Weigel 
to hold a hearing on Tham's bid to overturn his 1980 embezzlement conviction. 
Weigel testified that Aguilar spoke to him one or more times about Tham's case 
but never tried to influence him.

Now we know why County Supervisor Pete Schabarum developed a reputation as a 
grumpy guy who feuded with colleagues, bureaucrats and reporters during his 
18-year reign on the board. 
</P>
<P>
He was in a bad mood because of all the unflattering photos of him published by 
newspapers. He held his feelings inside for a long time. But, the other day, he 
finally wrote to The Times: 
</P>
<P>
". . . On the premise that you apparently do not have one decent photo of me in 
the several hundred shot in the last year or two, I am enclosing one you may 
wish to use." 
</P>
<P>
The decent photo shows a different side of Pete. This isn't Pete, the growling 
former football star. This is Smiling Pete. Pensive Pete. Scholarly Pete. 
</P>
<P>
We can only confess to Schabarum, whose retirement takes effect in December: 
</P>
<P>
Pete, we hardly knew ye. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of big babies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When Allen James Roughton came into the world at Queen of the Valley Hospital 
recently, he tipped the scales at 14 pounds, 3 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the largest I've ever had in my practice," said Dr. Henry Moghtader, a 
practitioner for 32 years. Because of the baby's weight, Allen was delivered by 
Cesarean section at the West Covina hospital two weeks before his due date. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed Pudge by his parents, Bryce, 32, and Laura, 31, Allen has another 
distinction: 
</P>
<P>
At birth, he had outgrown his baby clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The location of a law firm advertising in the publication California Power 
Producer is listed as "1901 Ave. of the Starts." An entry-level address in 
Century City?

"What an age we live in!" marvels Meredith Brucker of San Marino. "My husband 
and I were approaching our 25th wedding anniversary when neighbors of ours 
one-upped us by saying they were planning a party for their 50th. When I looked 
surprised, considering how young they look, they added it up: His first 
marriage lasted 20 years, her first lasted 15 years, and they've been married 
to each other for 15 years. Yep, they've been married 50 years, all right!" 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Chandler fans and others who are familiar with "gat" as a slang term 
for gun might do a double-take over the notice on the Bruin Theater's 
box-office window: 
</P>
<P>
"PASSES AND GATS BEFORE 6:00 ONLY." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds more like Dodge City than Westwood. Actually, the term stands for "group 
activity tickets." The other type of gat is frowned upon by the Bruin at all 
times.

While KCAL (Channel 9) identifies itself as a Los Angeles/Norwalk-based 
station, it has no facilities in Norwalk. The designation has appeared on the 
license since negotiations involving the station's former owners (RKO General), 
a one-time group of bidders (Norwalk-Fidelity Television), and the current 
owners (Walt Disney). KCAL can be picked up in Norwalk, though.

AL MARTINEZ: TOMMY AND THE BOYS OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tommy Miller stood near the pitcher's mound of Dodger Stadium on an evening as 
warm and sweet as honey in tea, observing home plate with a lopsided grin. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the catcher was ready for him he hesitated, treasuring a moment that 
would never come again, wanting it to last forever. 
</P>
<P>
All eyes were on him, the p.a. system was saying his name and he, Tommy Miller, 
was about to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasies come true on nights like this, aglow with the kind of shimmery half 
light that brightens dreams and fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
And this was a fantasy coming true. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Miller, age 34, peered forward just like Sandy Koufax used to do, went 
into a windup and threw. 
</P>
<P>
The ball seemed to hang in midair between the mound and home plate, suspended 
by the same magic that builds castles out of stardust and causes time to freeze 
on the ghosts of our ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
For those distracted by the anticipation of a real baseball game, Tommy 
Miller's moment was over before they had a chance to understand his ebullience 
or empathize with his joy. 
</P>
<P>
The ball fell into the catcher's mitt with a muffled thwump, the crowd cheered, 
Tommy Miller took a bow and the fantasy glimmered off like a child's dream, 
over the emerald field and into the coming night. 
</P>
<P>
But, man, what a moment. 
</P>
<P>
I sing today of those fantasies we create on the empty stages of our daydreams, 
climbing mountains of towering proportion, swimming oceans of endless expanse. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Miller, the ultimate fan, was able to leap from what Wordsworth saw as 
the bliss of reverie's solitude into the reality of Dodger Stadium to realize 
his fantasy before 45,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us should be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
His presence was part of a promotional gimmick called Think Blue Week, in which 
fans were invited to nominate someone to participate in a baseball fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy's wife nominated him to throw that ceremonial first pitch of the game 
between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros, because her Tommy is such a Dodger 
nut. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of those guys who, if he scratches his head while watching his team 
on TV and Eddie Murray hits a home run just at that moment, will scratch his 
head every time Murray comes to bat, even if it wears a hole in his skull. 
</P>
<P>
That will last until Murray strikes out during a head-scratch or hits into a 
double play, at which time Miller will be alert to other forms of sorcery 
intended to propel his team into a championship. 
</P>
<P>
He traces his amiable superstitions back to the time his mother was ironing 
clothes while watching the Dodgers play the hated New York Yankees during the 
first game of the 1963 World Series. The Dodgers won. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was 8 at the time and recalls his mom, also a fan, saying they won 
because she was ironing. Not wanting to tamper with luck, she also ironed while 
watching game two, and the Dodgers won again. 
</P>
<P>
This was too mystical to be coincidence, so naturally she continued ironing 
during the third and fourth games, and the Boys in Blue swept the series. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed, of course, that mom was responsible," Miller says with a laugh. 
But then he thinks about it for a moment and I notice he isn't laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is a game of fantasy and superstition, and Tommy Miller seems to 
symbolize them both. 
</P>
<P>
He will not watch the Dodgers on big-screen TV because they do not win on a big 
screen, and he will eat any kind of chicken during a game because the Dodgers 
win when he eats chicken. 
</P>
<P>
They lose during pizza. 
</P>
<P>
I discussed this with Miller on the morning of his Big Pitch. He was excited 
about the prospect of pitching, but, as an advertising executive, also 
understood the gossamer nature of fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a compulsion to his Dodger loyalty he will not deny. 
</P>
<P>
Take his memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
The man has got hats, pins, pennants and programs in such numbers to satisfy 
any fan, but even that isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
He similarly possesses videotapes of Dodger games, record albums of Dodger 
highlights and a 45 r.p.m. of Vin Scully calling the last inning of Bill 
Singer's 1970 no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
There are also boxes of newspapers that chronicle glorious moments in Dodger 
history on the sports page, while the front pages of the same journals thunder 
social calamity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of dumb, I suppose," Miller says, "but it's fun. Everybody ought to 
be a fan of something." 
</P>
<P>
That night, he stood on the mound in the perfect stillness of a spring dream, 
grinned at the crowd and threw his single pitch. 
</P>
<P>
That night, he was Don Drysdale and Fernando Valenzuela. That night, he was a 
star. And that night, the Dodgers won 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with that.

<P>
The questions raised concerning the way in which federal regulators treated 
President Bush's son Neil during their investigation of his conduct as a 
director of the failed Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan Assn. differ in 
degree, though not in kind, from those that must be answered if the thrift 
debacle ever is to be resolved satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
The American financial system has suffered nothing like the collapse of the 
savings and loan industry since the Depression. That it has occurred without 
triggering panic is testimony to the wisdom of the federal deposit insurance 
programs adopted in the wake of that last great economic upheaval. However, 
confidence has its price and, in this case, it may reach a staggering half a 
trillion dollars in public liability. 
</P>
<P>
The American people, whose taxes will have to cover that debt, deserve clear 
answers to two questions: How did deregulation go so badly awry that the thrift 
industry was turned from a reliable source of home mortgages into a kind of 
floating crap game? Does the federal government have the will to pursue those 
individuals who took this catastrophic failure of public policy as an 
opportunity to behave irresponsibly or criminally, even though many of them are 
wealthy and politically influential? 
</P>
<P>
The issues raised in Neil Bush's case speak directly to the latter question. 
Much about the Silverado failure -- whose cost to taxpayers will exceed $1 
billion -- is curious. In October, 1988, when Colorado state officials moved to 
close down the insolvent institution for which the younger Bush had served as 
an outside director for three years, regional federal regulators -- acting on 
instructions from Washington -- intervened. They kept Silverado open until Nov. 
9, the day after George Bush won election. Earlier this year, the enforcement 
staff of the Office of Thrift Supervision recommended that Neil Bush be banned 
from the industry because he had engaged in "personal dishonesty" and had 
"willfully breached" his fiduciary duties while serving as a Silverado 
director. Four of the institution's executives subsequently signed consent 
orders accepting such a prohibition. However, federal regulators, citing the 
lack of evidence against Bush, sought a lesser penalty for him -- a 
cease-and-desist order directing that he refrain from violating disclosure 
rules. Neil Bush denies any wrongdoing and is contesting even that order. 
</P>
<P>
All of this may reflect nothing more than the normal coincidence and 
uncertainty that are part of any complex investigation. It also is possible 
that it reflects the official favoritism, influence-peddling and insider 
arrogance that have been part of the thrift problem from the beginning. That is 
an ambiguity every bit as intolerable as the S&amp;L crisis itself.

SPIES AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Espionage has become big business. In his article, Christopher says, " . . . 
Spying has endangered our national security to such a breathtaking extent that 
we can all be thankful that war did not break out while some of our most 
sensitive secrets were compromised." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But maybe the truth is just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the reason that the Cold War never turned hot was because our secrets, 
as well as the Soviets' were compromised. (We have our spies, too.) It's not 
impossible that the acts of those agents provided each of us with enough "hard" 
information about the other's abilities to prevent a suicidal act.

CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVE NEW SPENDING FOR ROADS AND RAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking at the primary ballot, I am again convinced that Californians do not 
need a state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
What we really need are more supermarkets, where even more people can get our 
signatures on new propositions for the next election. Is this democracy at its 
best? I doubt it. Ballot propositions seem to create distortion of facts, 
confusion, visual pollution with billboard ads and prejudice, all contradictory 
to rational government. 
</P>
<P>
There are some positive results, however. The California Supreme Court and a 
legion of lawyers are guaranteed perpetual employment, as they unravel the 
constitutional soundness of all those propositions.

I was disappointed in your article on Peru which stated that Sendero Luminoso 
has been responsible for almost 18,000 deaths in the past decade (Part A, June 
11). 
</P>
<P>
This absolves the military and paramilitary from their responsibility in 
thousands of those deaths. While recognizing the fanatical violence of Sendero 
Luminoso, human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have repeatedly 
condemned the Peruvian military's abuses, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism" is a tactic resorted to by both sides in Peru's so-called 
democracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Assemblyman Tom McClintock's "Fools Rush In, Trip on Their Own 
Platform," Commentary, June 7: 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the assemblyman's anger over the election results on have 
little to do with anything, but stem from the fact that he is completely out of 
stream with California voters -- even worse, his own constituents, who 
supported Prop. 111. 
</P>
<P>
While he lambastes the passage of Prop. 111, he gives very little credit to the 
intelligence of the voters and their call to action to deal with the acute 
infrastructure problems we are experiencing -- problems for which he never 
offered a solution in his campaign against Prop. 111, nor in his legislative 
career. 
</P>
<P>
I always felt he had the easiest job in town in campaigning against Prop. 111 
-- reviving both the public's anger that drove in Prop. 13's tax cuts and, 
ironically, the distrust of his own peers in the Legislature to spend these new 
revenues wisely. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the voters have spoken and charged McClintock with a job he was 
heretofore unwilling to do -- implementing a long-range transportation plan -- 
let's hope this time he'll listen to them.

A HOUSING IDEA THAT MIGHT FLY;

<P>
IN WATSONVILLE, A DOGFIGHT DEVELOPS OVER AIRPORT LAND USE.

WATSONVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drive into this farm town in the Pajaro Valley, 90 miles south of San 
Francisco, and the sign says that 27,000 souls dwell within the city's limits, 
a piece of solid misinformation as such signs usually are. Double the number 
and you'll be nearer the truth. For years Watsonville, like other towns across 
the state and across the nation, has been facing and ignoring a crisis in 
low-cost housing. Many of the workers -- pickers and packers -- who help earn 
Watsonville its agricultural wealth cram with their families into garages or 
made-over chicken coops, or sleep in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
It took the earthquake last October to signal just how bad Watsonville's 
housing situation really is. When the red-tagging was done, it turned out that 
time after time, two, three or four families had been piled into the old 
Maybeck redwood houses. For most of them, the trailers forced from a reluctant 
Federal Emergency Management Agency were a step up in life. 
</P>
<P>
Right now the city of Watsonville reckons it needs 2,585 more units for 
low-income households. Under the laggard tempo of business-as-usual, there's no 
way this demand can be slaked. For a start, if land costs at least $100,000 to 
$600,000 an acre, how could Watsonville ever have $80,000 homes or $400-a-month 
rentals? 
</P>
<P>
But it so happens that Watsonville does have over 300 acres of land at its 
disposal for low- and moderate-income housing, and a week ago the Veterans Hall 
on East Beach Street echoed with jagged exchanges as citizens debated the 
merits of using the land for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
It was local organizer Frank Bardacke back in January who, writing in 
Watsonville's bilingual monthly El Andar, first pointed out that the city-owned 
airport, covering 331 acres, would be doing humanity a far better turn as a 
site for cheap housing, parks and schools than as "an aviation theme park for 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
Like rent control, another idea being seriously batted around Watsonville, 
Bardacke's suggestion was an unwelcome arrival at the table of respectable 
opinion. The aviators hated it, of course, and so did developer and booster 
types, to whom the words "low- and moderate-income" represent a profound 
spiritual affront. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ensuing months the idea has been pushed to and fro. At the Veterans 
Hall, the class geography of Watsonville was forthrightly on display: City and 
Santa Cruz County officials ranged at the head of the hall; trim aviators and 
their business allies in the center sector; off in the right rear bleachers the 
poor folk, mostly browner and smaller and waving signs such as "Houses not 
hangars" and "Why are we subsidizing rich men's toys?" 
</P>
<P>
To hear the pilot faction tell the story, you'd conclude that Watsonville 
airport has played the same vital municipal function as LAX and the Port of Los 
Angeles rolled into one -- a bustling commercial entrepot, apt for civic 
emergency and hosing treasure into the city's coffers. Besides, said the 
aviators, there were federal restrictions mandating that it remain an airport 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
These claims wilted as the night wore on and the housing advocates made their 
case. As a hub of commerce, Watsonville airport keeps a very low profile. The 
only regular user is UPS, with a daily flight that may soon be terminated. For 
emergencies there is Monterey airport half an hour down the road, plus private 
strips and helipads nearby. The airport's one moment of virtuous glory -- when 
it was used to rush supplies to Watsonville after the earthquake -- balances 
poorly against the daily social emergency of the housing crisis. Just 67 users 
of the airport have Watsonville addresses; the place runs at a loss, and the 
feds have no claim on it. 
</P>
<P>
Both nature and power abhor a vacuum, and so power -- pilot power, developer 
power -- is trying to fill the dangerous vacuum of this socially marginal, 
economically useless airport land with bureaucratic sludge: A brand new 
"airport land use commission" replete with members of the airport lobby, which 
will answer to state guidelines about appropriate airport development, 
decisions to be overturned only by a two-thirds city council or county 
supervisor majority -- you get the idea. Push elected officials as much as 
possible out of the picture. Ah, democracy! So much to be cherished in Eastern 
Europe, so much to be feared at home where, as Manuel Osorio testified that 
night, families live in spaces as small as 8 feet by 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The battle will roll on. Even a couple of years ago the housing advocates would 
not have stood a chance and Watsonville would be shaped by respectable power 
into the fin de siecle contour of dormitory for the rich, slum for the poor. 
But Watsonville has a feisty activist population and -- as do hundreds of other 
towns -- it has a housing crisis that will never be solved by the agenda of 
business-as-usual.

THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY FIGHTS FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN SOLD INTO SERVITUDE OR

<P>
South of the river, in a slightly seedy section of the city, in a 
down-at-the-heels building that has seen better days but not better uses, the 
Anti-Slavery Society is still in business, because slavery is, too. Founded in 
1839, it is the world's oldest human-rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
As it raises its small voice amid the incessant clamor for public attention, it 
faces the problem of stark incredulity concerning its threshold assertion: 
Slavery exists. 
</P>
<P>
Today there may be as many, perhaps many more, people in conditions properly 
denoted as slavery as there were when the society was founded. So says the 
society's director, Lesley Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
She is not one of those flurried people one so often sees in the world of 
altruism, the kind who perpetually look as though they had risen late and 
dressed in haste. She has the brisk manner of one who has worked in banks, 
which she has done, and she has the restlessness to have been bored by that, 
which she was. In an office lit only, and dimly, by watery sunlight that 
struggles through unwashed windows, she enumerates the society's concerns, 
beginning with chattel slavery -- the total ownership of one person by another. 
It was officially outlawed in the Arabian Peninsula less than 20 years ago, and 
may even be expanding in parts of northern Africa, particularly Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
Far more prevalent, and properly called slavery, is debt bondage, especially of 
children. Such laborers are bound for payment of debts and are entirely 
subservient to a power from which there is no appeal. 
</P>
<P>
There are workers in servitude in both hemispheres. Roberts says that many 
Haitians living illegally in the Dominican Republic have been, in effect, sold 
to state-owned sugar plantations. But the biggest problems are in Asia, where 
slavery often is a particularly odious, because routinized, form of child 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Children are, in a sense, "natural" slaves -- a renewable source of slaves -- 
because they are born into total dependence on adults. Children are sometimes 
sold outright, at prices commonly ranging from $20 in the Sudan to $200 in 
Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
Social traditions no longer sanctioned by laws -- traditions of caste and class 
-- can still be as strong as iron fetters. There is the tradition of giving a 
child for, say, a year, in payment of debt -- sometimes a debt incurred by 
parents who borrow from loan sharks, using children as collateral. At the end 
of the year, the person holding the child in bondage may say the child has 
eaten so much that the bondage must be extended. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows even within several scores of millions how many children are 
enslaved in domestic service, in sweatshops or in Asia's huge sex trade. When 
computing the probable numbers, says Roberts, "it is not hard to get up to 200 
million." 
</P>
<P>
In India, for example, the government says there are fewer than 200,000 bonded 
laborers. The society's sources say 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Look down, dear reader, you may be walking on them. Demand for Indian carpets 
soared when the price of Iranian carpets rose after the shah outlawed child 
labor in the early 1970s. Today in India's main carpet-weaving region (small 
hands, such as those of seven-year-olds, tie especially tight knots), there are 
100,000 malnourished children employed. Some 15% of them, according to the 
society, were sold into bondage in spite of the fact that India outlawed debt 
bondage 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They often work 12-hour days (poorly fed; subjected to corporal punishment; 
often sleeping at their looms six, sometimes seven, days a week, for a weekly 
wage sometimes as low as $1). Today, as two centuries ago, slavery pays. The 
labor costs of a carpet that may sell in London for $6,000 can be as little as 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
While sifting abundant evidence of such slavery (and worse: Millions of 
children, male and female, are devoured by Asia's prostitution industry), the 
society maintains a remarkable emotional equipoise, advocating piecemeal 
remedies for absolute evils. For example, it does not favor banning imports of 
carpets made with coerced labor. It knows that destroying the carpet industry 
would destroy many lives. An existing industry can be improved. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity, embarrassment, persuasion, organized labor -- these are among the 
remedies required. But the first requirement is the patience of politics, which 
acquires special dignity in the face of such shattering facts. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts and the society are echoes of the distinctive moral earnestness that 
redeemed the 19th Century and leavens this one. "I get bored easily," she says. 
"This is not boring."

PERSPECTIVE ON CANADA;

LAST GASP OF AMICABLE FEDERALISM; 
</P>
<P>
IF THE QUEBEC ISSUE IS NOT SOLVED, THERE IS LITTLE HOPE FOR STEMMING VIOLENT 
ETHNIC CONFLICTS IN THE LESS-DEVELOPED WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By PIERRE TRUDEAU, Pierre Trudeau was prime minister of Canada from 1968-79 and 
from 1980-84. This article is based in part on Trudeau's book Towards a Just 
Society (Viking Penguin, 1990), co-edited with Tom Axworthy.

<P>
As the prime minister who pressed successfully for the enactment of the 
Canadian Constitution Act of 1982 -- which eschewed "distinct society" status 
for Quebec (subsequently granted by the Meech Lake Accord of 1987 and which now 
threatens to Balkanize Canada) in favor of a federalist solution -- I think 
there is universal value in the Canadian experience for all states grappling 
with the reemergence of ethnic-based nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
If 6 million Canadians of French origin cannot manage to share their national 
sovereignty with 20 million Canadians of British and other origins, there is 
very little hope for far less privileged regions of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, when a state has taken an exclusive and intolerant idea 
such as religion or ethnicity as its cornerstone, this idea has more often than 
not been the mainspring of violence and war. In days gone by, religion had to 
be displaced as the basis of the state before frightful religious wars came to 
an end. And there will be little hope of putting an end to wars between nations 
until, in some similar fashion, the "nation" in ethnic terms ceases to be the 
basis of a state. 
</P>
<P>
A state that defines its function essentially in terms of ethnic or religious 
attributes inevitably becomes chauvinistic and intolerant. Nationalists, 
whether of the left or right, are politically reactionary because they are led 
to define the common good as a function of an ethnic group or religious ideal 
rather than in terms of "all the people" regardless of individual 
characteristics. This is why a nationalistic government is by nature 
intolerant, discriminatory and, when all is said and done, totalitarian. 
</P>
<P>
As Lord Acton wrote in as early as 1862, the nation as an ideal unit founded on 
race "overrules the rights and wishes of its inhabitants, absorbing their 
divergent interests in a fictitious unity; sacrifices their inclinations and 
duties to the higher claim of nationality, and crushes all natural rights and 
all established liberties for the purpose of vindicating itself. Whenever a 
single definite object is made the supreme end of the State, the State becomes 
for the time being inevitably absolute." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a truly democratic government -- whether provincial or federal -- cannot 
be "nationalist" because it must pursue the good of all its citizens regardless 
of sex, color, race, religious belief or ethnic origin. Democratic government 
stands for good citizenship, never nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the state must disregard cultural or linguistic values. 
Among the many values that a political society must protect and develop, these 
have high priority. It is therefore entirely desirable that a state ensure, 
through its constitution and legislation, the protection of such values. It is 
inevitable that its policies will serve the interests of ethnic groups and 
especially of the majority group in proportion to its numbers. But this will 
happen as a natural consequence of the equality of all its citizens, not as a 
special privilege -- such as "a distinct society" -- of the largest group in a 
given territory. 
</P>
<P>
I entered federal politics in Canada precisely for the purpose of putting these 
principles into practice. I believed strongly then, as I do now, that 
federalism by definition is a superior form of government, because it is more 
pluralist than monolithic and therefore respects diversity among people and 
groups. In general, freedom has a firmer foundation under federalism than in 
any kind of unitary nation-state. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in Canada, where the die is firmly cast. There are two 
main ethnic and linguistic groups. Each is too strong and too deeply rooted in 
the past, too firmly bound to a mother culture, to be able to engulf the other. 
</P>
<P>
I have always believed that if these two groups could collaborate at the hub of 
a truly pluralistic state, Canada could become the envied seat of a form of 
federalism that could become a brilliant prototype for the molding of 
tomorrow's polyethnic civilization, a better model even than the American 
melting pot. Rather than forging a new alloy, the Canadian model would preserve 
the characteristics of each group in a mosaic of cultural coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution Act of 1982 declared equal economic opportunity under which 
"the government of Canada and the provincial governments undertake to promote 
equal opportunities for the well-being of all Canadians." Furthermore, the act 
embraced the principle of equality of French and English in all domains of 
federal jurisdiction, and guaranteed both Francophones and Anglophones the 
right to education in their own language anywhere in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The essential principles so relevant to the current upheaval are embraced by 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In the grand tradition of the 1789 
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and the 1791 Bill of Rights of 
the United States, the Canadian Charter implicitly established the primacy of 
the individual over the state and all government institutions, and in so doing, 
recognized that all sovereignty resides in the people. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the Canadian Charter was a new beginning for the Canadian 
nation. It sought to strengthen the country's unity by basing the sovereignty 
of the Canadian people on a set of values common to all, and on the notion of 
equality among all Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
The spirit and substance of the Canadian Charter is clear: to protect the 
individual against not only the tyranny of the state, but also any other 
tyranny to which the individual may be subjected by virtue of his belonging to 
a minority group. 
</P>
<P>
Having reviewed these principles, it should be manifestly clear how the notion 
of Quebec as a "distinct society" (wherein individual rights are subordinated 
to collective rights) threatens to undermine the very foundation of a liberal 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's model federalist solution to Quebec nationalism once heralded a hope 
for a mankind facing the rapid integration of a polyethnic and interdependent 
world. Now I fear the Balkanization of Canada may presage a return to premodern 
conflicts once thought to have passed into history. 
</P>
<P>
If the 19th Century is what awaits us at the opening of the 21st, it behooves 
us to listen once again to Lord Acton, one of the great thinkers of the 19th 
Century, who described with extraordinarily prophetic insight the errors of 
nationalism that were to soak the 20th Century with so much blood and acrimony: 
</P>
<P>
"A great democracy must either sacrifice self-government to unity or preserve 
it by federalism. . . . The coexistence of several nations under the same State 
is a test, as well as the best security of its freedom. It is also one of the 
chief instruments of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of different nations in one State is as necessary a condition 
of civilized life as the combination of men in society. Where political and 
national boundaries coincide, society ceases to advance, and nations relapse 
into a condition corresponding to that of men who renounce intercourse with 
their fellow men. 
</P>
<P>
A state which is incompetent to satisfy different races condemns itself; a 
State which labors to neutralize, to absorb, or to expel them is destitute of 
the chief basis of self-government. The theory of nationality, then, is a 
retrograde step in history."

ERMA BOMBECK: WRONG TURNS PUT WAYWARD MEN ON THE MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERMA BOMBECK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd like to destroy the myth that women can't read a road map and men, on the 
other hand, are endowed with a great sense of direction. 
</P>
<P>
A schoolteacher from Stevensville, Md., has asked that I settle the dispute 
once and for all. She teaches children how to read road maps, and yet her 
husband charged, "Put you in a phone booth, Joan, turn you around, and you 
couldn't find your way out of it." Her retort is, "What about Christopher 
Columbus?" 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, what about Christopher Columbus? Turn the guy around in the Bahamas a 
couple of times, and he couldn't find America if it was on fire. And he can't 
blame it on a woman reading the navigational charts! 
</P>
<P>
And while we're illuminating some of the gems of direction, let us not forget 
Douglas Corrigan, a pilot who in 1939 climbed into his monoplane in New York 
headed for California. Twenty-four hours later, he looked out and, instead of a 
palm tree, saw Dublin's airport. Did people say to him, "Is figuring out east 
and west too hard for you?" No, they gave him a hero's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Men are always pointing out their great explorations. The truth? They were lost 
half of the time. Burton and Speke didn't know if they found the source of the 
Nile or a new strain of mosquito. Dr. David Livingstone just sort of "stumbled 
onto" Victoria Falls. 
</P>
<P>
In 1531, when Pizarro and his troops went to Peru to relieve it of its gold, a 
hundred maidens escaped and found refuge in a secret hideaway, Machu Picchu. 
The women found it, but Pizarro didn't have a clue where they were hiding. In 
fact, it took 380 years for it to be rediscovered. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, no argument on bearings would be complete without mentioning 
Roy Riegels. Maybe his is not a household name, but sportsmen and history will 
remember him as the player for the University of California who blew the 1929 
Rose Bowl for his team by galloping into the sunlight with ball in hand for a 
total of 70 yards -- to reach his own goal line. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with all of these men is that they didn't ask. The stubbornness of 
explorers probably set this country back 400 years. That and the fact they 
wouldn't listen to their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Men just have to learn to trust us. As my friend Joan wrote, "Where would men 
be today if Eve hadn't helped Adam find his way out of the Garden of Eden?" 
Isn't that the truth?

DEVILS, FOR A CHANGE BY WENDY PERRIAM ST. MARTIN'S PRESS $19.95, 469 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABRIELLE DONNELLY

<TEXT>
<P>
Some books you like or dislike unreservedly; some, you like despite their 
weaknesses, or dislike despite their strengths. A few, however, have the power 
to make you like them, not merely in spite of their flaws but along with, even 
because of them. Such a book is Wendy Perriam's latest novel, "Devils, for a 
Change." 
</P>
<P>
The story is of Hilary Reed, the former Sister Mary Hilary, an English 
contemplative nun in one of the strictest orders in Europe, who, as the book 
opens, quite suddenly leaves her order and makes her way to London. Over the 
course of a year, she meets a variety of people, has adventures, romances, 
disillusionments and crises of faith, and emerges at the end changed, 
strengthened, still spiritual but also occasionally ready to be a "devil, for a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of the book is in the character of Hilary. Perriam has a rare 
ability to get under the skin of her main character -- a bit too far under, in 
fact, in the case of the supremely irritating, whining protagonist of her 
previous "Under Purple." Hilary, though, is another kettle of fish. She is 
intelligent, earnest and a little simple. She is lacking somewhat in 
self-confidence, and somewhat more in humor; she makes occasional faulty 
judgments, and becomes, often, extremely confused; she desperately wants to do 
the moral thing. You recognize her immediately and are rooting for her all the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
It is through her mercy, too, that you get a quite wonderfully vivid, yet 
impartial, view of convent life. Perriam knows her convents through and 
through, and -- more unusual -- she has remained able to view them without 
apparent prejudice either for or against. Thus we are shown without prurience 
the chosen rigors of the life -- the bare feet on cold mornings, the active 
seeking of "penance," the constant quest to humble the body by denial of 
pleasures. We are shown, too, without sentiment, that distinctive, childlike 
charm peculiar to many nuns: the delight in luxuries smaller than most of us 
would notice, the sheer, cloistered innocence of them. 
</P>
<P>
Set against the convent is the description of modern London, beginning with a 
horribly accurate six-page picture of the underground at rush hour and 
continuing by turns terrible, poignant and comical; Hilary, Candide-like, 
encounters every aspect of the modern world, from post-punk haircuts to lessons 
in the Alexander technique, from tampons to charismatic priests. 
</P>
<P>
Both environments are convincingly portrayed; each bounces off the other in a 
way that can only intensify both. 
</P>
<P>
Where the book falters is in the many other characters that Hilary meets in her 
quest for self-fulfillment. Each appears to possess just one outstanding 
characteristic. Thus, you have, appearing in turn, the Earthy Working Woman, 
the Problem Child, the Feminist, the Ardent Suitor, etc. The speech habits of 
each can only be called curious, not so in conversations with Hilary as 
delivering to her, sometimes within minutes of introduction, miniature 
disquisitions, stating precisely what they feel about a given situation, 
offering a couple of alternative reasons why they might feel it, and quite 
often backing it all up with some statistics they just happen to have read in a 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
How many, for instance, 17-year-old beauticians -- or, indeed, any 17-year-old 
anythings -- do you know who talk like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Nor am I (married). But it doesn't stop me having sex. Don't get me wrong, 
Hilary, I wouldn't sleep around. It's far too dangerous nowadays, apart from 
being cheap. But if I meet a bloke I like -- and trust -- then I'll go to bed 
with him. It's part of being human, part of living. . . . All my crowd feel 
much the same. . . ." And on, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of hundred pages of this, you are left with two choices: tossing 
the book aside wearily, or deciding to adapt to its rhythm. With "Devils," you 
opt for the latter, because it is, on the whole, a very good book -- in both 
the moral and the literary sense -- and because Hilary is so very real, so very 
admirable, and because you care so very much that she find the right answers. 
</P>
<P>
After a bit, you find yourself actually enjoying the dialogue, the way you do 
the quirks of an eccentric but well-loved friend. 
</P>
<P>
And as Hilary herself finds in the course of the book, you really shouldn't 
expect perfection.

MILLETT'S 'ATTACKS' DO A 'DISSERVICE' TO MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Author Kate Millett's attacks on psychiatry and the "myth" of mental illness do 
a disservice to the millions of mentally ill Americans and their families. 
Mental illness does exist and tends to be genetic ("In a Mind Field," June 13). 
</P>
<P>
I suffer from the same illness Millett was diagnosed with: manic depression. 
However, I have a strong desire not to be victimized by this horrendous 
condition, which led to the suicide deaths of my grandmother and great-aunt, 
and contributed to the deaths of my mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, after 10 years of suffering and missed diagnoses, I have 
been taking lithium, which has improved the quality of my life 100%. Only 
someone who has suffered the anguish of being a victim of one's own emotions 
and thoughts can fully realize the difference freedom from this condition 
brings. 
</P>
<P>
Millett says she should have been able to pursue her divorce, her search for a 
lesbian lover, her activism on behalf of a Trinidad prisoner, her public 
breakdowns, her political forays to Ireland and Iran, and her attempt to kill 
herself without the intervention of family and psychiatrists. She denounces 
psychiatrists as frauds and says madness is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
In an extreme emotional state, Millett tried to poison herself with gas, but 
thankfully was unsuccessful. My brother, in a manic state, drove all night 
through the countryside and caused an accident that killed him and two other 
people. He, like Millett, had denounced all psychiatrists as phony and had 
rebelled against taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
Can society afford the ramifications of mentally ill people who refuse to be 
treated? More importantly, can they themselves afford it? My brother, 
understandably, did not want the stigma that comes with mental illness. 
Americans' idea of mentally ill people are those who shoot assault rifles into 
crowded schoolyards or who are otherwise undependable and untrustworthy. Only 
my husband and a few close friends know about my condition. I cannot afford the 
employment discrimination and other societal sanctions that would be imposed on 
me if my manic depression was known.

CULTIVATING THEIR SOURCES: CHEFS AND THEIR GARDENS; 
</P>
<P>
FRESH INGREDIENTS: SOME CHEFS PREFER TO GROW THEIR OWN.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a fundamental fact that no cook, however creative and capable, can produce 
a dish of a quality any higher than that of the raw ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alice Waters 
</P>
<P>
For Ken Frank, this is the week tomatoes are due. If all goes according to 
plan, customers at his La Toque restaurant on the Sunset Strip, may bite into 
slices of tasty Champion tomatoes ("a good old American hybrid," Frank says), 
dressed only with slivers of elephant garlic, some cucumber, a few leaves of 
fresh basil and a sprinkling of good extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. 
Everything but the oil and salt and pepper will have come from Frank's 
backyard. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have enough time or space in my garden to grow everything for the 
restaurant," Frank says. "But some of this stuff, specifically basil and 
tomatoes, you can't buy as good as you can grow." 
</P>
<P>
The tomato eater who feeds on supermarket tomatoes, even upscale supermarket 
tomatoes, will instantly realize that Frank is not exaggerating after a bite of 
a Frank home-grown. It's not that he grows hyper-specialized varieties; besides 
the hearty Champion ("I just got the seeds at the Hollywood Nursery," he says), 
Frank grows two French varieties -- "a really good, medium-sized tomato called 
Carmello," he says, "and a new one I'm trying this year called Lorissa." (The 
French breeds will arrive fashionably later in the season.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried a lot of varieties -- some with just stupendous fruit," Frank says, 
"but they weren't terribly efficient. Unique and pretty is wonderful, but 
there's more to food than something that's, you know, candy-cane-colored. I'd 
rather have something that produces consistently well and tastes great." 
</P>
<P>
The difference, then, is the immediacy of a just-picked tomato. Frank, who 
lives in Laurel Canyon, a few minutes away from his restaurant, usually picks 
the day's harvest in the morning, just before he heads to La Toque for the 
lunch shift. Sometimes, he'll run home between meals. 
</P>
<P>
"I grow corn," Frank says, "not very much, and certainly not enough for the 
whole restaurant, but a couple of times a year I'll pick a little for special 
customers. If they're coming in at, say, 12:30, I'll run home just as we open 
at noon, pick it real fast, come back, and have the water boiling. That first 
half hour is like magic -- the corn is so sweet, as if you'd dipped it in 
syrup. You almost want to say, 'who put sugar on this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Frank's home garden, started in 1986, also produces tarragon, edible flowers 
(nasturtium and Johnny-jump-ups), lots of baby lettuce varieties, raspberries 
("they're descendants of raspberries my parents have been growing for 20 years, 
he says), peppers that Frank says are "hot as hell," and lots of basil. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a small restaurant, but I could easily spend $10 a day on basil," Frank 
says. "So I figure at $60 a week, it's worth planting five dollars worth of 
basil seeds. Besides, a lot of the time the basil you buy is ratty by the time 
you get it. 
</P>
<P>
And commercial farmers generally don't pinch just the top, which is the best 
part, they cut whole branches. Growing my own, I can pick it fresh the way I 
want it every day. It grows like a weed. In fact, when it really goes into 
production, from say, mid-July, through November, we give it away by the 
grocery-bag-full. It's amazingly prolific stuff. Of course, during the winter, 
after the plants go to seed, I'm stuck buying it." 
</P>
<P>
Frank grows three types of basil: opal, or as Frank says, "the purple stuff"; 
cinnamon, which he says is "just seductively flavored"; and green basil, which 
he uses for pesto. 
</P>
<P>
In his lettuce patch, Frank grows baby red romaine, baby bibb, and his 
favorite, lola rosa, a slightly curly red-leafed Italian lettuce. With these, 
Frank serves a mix of baby lettuce varieties, not as a salad basic (he has to 
rely on outside producers to supply the lettuce for his larger salads), but as 
an accompaniment to a special dish, or a palate perker in the context of a 
multi-course meal. Sometimes he'll use the greens in hot salads, one with foie 
gras, and another with warm wild mushrooms and creme fraiche dressing. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important rule Frank cooks by when using his own produce is: keep 
it simple. "It's hard to do better than a just-picked tomato," he says, "why 
muck it up?" 
</P>
<P>
He has the same philosophy for the garden itself: "There's not a drop of 
pesticide or chemical fertilizer in my garden," he says. "There are no aphids, 
either. It's all organic. I use chicken manure and fish emulsion, lots of 
compost. All the clippings from my garden get recycled. It's the best way to do 
it. The Chinese have been organically farming for 4,000 years, way before 
agriculture became sophisticated. Now people are realizing, hey, you know what? 
They were right 4,000 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But, Frank, who's never comfortable being trendy (he's still waiting for 
arugula to go out of style), isn't a purist on the subject of organic produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, 'organic' has never been the most important thing to me," he says. 
"I think the whole business is overrated. I try to get fresh produce that looks 
good and tastes good. A lot of it ends up being organic, but you know, I get 
boxes of tomatoes from Mexico that aren't organic. That's life in business. And 
the organic stuff isn't always better -- sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't, 
but it's not automatically better. I'm not ready to say, it must be organic or 
not at all; we're not there yet. We're getting there. A lot of the big farming 
operations are going more organic. They're finding that they don't want to use 
pesticides and that people don't want them. So I think everything's moving in 
the right direction. But I'm not going to go on the rampage about it." 
</P>
<P>
It's the fruit in this country that got Tindaro Pettignano into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked by the quality in the stores here," says Pettignano, the chef and 
owner of La Pergola in Sherman Oaks. "It all looks very big and beautiful, but 
the taste is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Pettignano, known as Tino to his customers, moved to the United States 10 years 
ago from Italy. He grew up in Messina, Sicily, where he worked in agriculture 
until he was 18. Then went into the restaurant business with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"In Italy the fruit also looks good," he says, "but when people go to the 
store, they judge it by how it tastes, not how it looks. Sometimes fruit can be 
a little smashed, but it still gets bought if it tastes good. I think fruit is 
harvested more ripe where I come from -- we give it time to get some flavor." 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that when Pettignano decided to open a restaurant two years 
ago, he also started a garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I grow my own thing because it's so hard to find good things for the 
restaurant," he says. "You buy lettuce in the store and then get some from my 
garden and the difference is enormous. After you know what the real thing is, 
you don't want to buy the other stuff." 
</P>
<P>
But when La Pergola first opened, Pettignano didn't have the space to grow 
everything he needed for the restaurant. His first batch was grown on the 
restaurant's roof. Later he started cultivating the front and back yards of his 
house, which is just 50 yards from the restaurant; it still wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year he noticed an empty space close to the restaurant and started 
scheming. "I asked the lady who owns the land if I could put a garden on the 
lot and she said, 'sure.' " Pettignano says. "She's owned the land for 30 years 
and doesn't want to build again; she told me I can lease it for as long as I 
want." 
</P>
<P>
With that go-ahead, Pettignano turned what was once a parking lot ("People were 
using it as a trash dump," he says) into a lush, 6,000-square-foot garden. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got corn, tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, cucumbers, bell peppers, romaine 
and red leaf lettuce, arugula, broccoli, cauliflower, grapes, peaches, 
apricots, figs, strawberries, and really beautiful raspberries and 
boysenberries, real delicious. We make sorbets and ice cream with them," he 
says. "And I make the garden look beautiful with flowers, too. I've got all 
these roses and sunflowers, so beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
It's obviously a labor of love; Pettignano doesn't save money by growing his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"It cost me a lot of money to set up a water system and close off a path around 
the garden," he says. "I have a full-time gardener, too. And everything's 
organic. I figure it's cheaper to buy than to grow, but it's so different." 
</P>
<P>
On certain specialized items, however, Pettignano does save money. "Swiss chard 
is hard to find," he says. "One small case costs $18. But the ones I grow in my 
garden are big and delicious. And I can grow Maui onions in my garden, too. At 
the store they're $6 a pound, but I was counting yesterday and I have 400 
pounds of Maui onions -- each one is one-and-a-half pounds." 
</P>
<P>
With his onions, Pettignano makes Maui onion soup or he grills them and tosses 
them in a field salad. "But I couldn't do those dishes if I had to buy," he 
says. "Those onions cost more than meat!" 
</P>
<P>
He pauses to take a breath and then sighs. "You see," he finally says, "the 
difference when you grow your own is enormous."

<P>
DEAR SOS: Fromin's Delicatessen in Encino serves a great tuna salad. Do you 
think they'll want to part with the recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JERRY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JERRY: Fromin's corporate representatives even saved us the chore of 
reducing the quantity size recipe to serve eight to 10. 
</P>
<P>
FROMIN'S TUNA SALAD

3 tablespoons sweet pickle relish 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon white pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
</P>
<P>
1 cup mayonnaise, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
Drain tuna well. Place in mixing bowl and break into small pieces. Wash celery 
and chop fine. Trim and discard crust from egg bread. Finely chop bread. 
</P>
<P>
Add celery, egg bread, relish, pepper and garlic powder to tuna. Add mayonnaise 
and mix well. Cover and refrigerate. Makes 4 1/2 cups or 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I am asking for the recipe for Chocolate Mousse Pie, which appeared 
in your newspaper. I misplaced my copy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- EVELYN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR EVELYN: The original recipe came from judge Mildred Lillie of the Court of 
Appeals in Los Angeles. She developed the recipe 10 years ago because she was 
tired of having to go out to restaurants to enjoy it. Chocolate mousse cake was 
a rage during that period. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE MOUSSE PIE 
</P>
<P>
8 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
Sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup brandy 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces unsweetened chocolate 
</P>
<P>
2 ounces semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup brewed coffee 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Crust 
</P>
<P>
Cherry Cordials 
</P>
<P>
Combine egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups sugar, vanilla, salt and brandy in top of double 
boiler. Place over simmering water and beat until pale yellow and thick, about 
8 to 10 minutes. Remove from water and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Melt both types of chocolate in top of double boiler over hot water. When 
melted, remove from water and beat in butter, bit at time. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually beat chocolate into egg yolk mixture until smooth. Chocolate mixture 
will congeal and become very stiff. Beat in coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites (at room temperature) into soft peaks. Gradually beat in 3 
tablespoons sugar until stiff peaks form.

The National Pork Producers Council has the following tips for grilling safety: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always read the owner's manual before using a new barbecue grill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never use gasoline or other highly volatile fluids as a starter; they may 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barbecue grills should not be used within 5 feet of any combustible 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For fewer hazardous sparks, experts recommend using a covered grill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never use a barbecue grill unless all parts of the unit are firmly in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barbecue grills should be kept at a level position at all times; an 
unstable unit can easily be tipped over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Infants, children and pets should never be left unattended near a hot 
barbecue grill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never add liquid starter to hot or even warm coals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After unplugging, remove a hot electric starter carefully and remember 
where you placed it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always use flame-resistant barbecue mitts and barbecue tools with long, 
heat-resistant handles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barbecue mitts should be worn to adjust hot vents. Wear a heavy apron to 
protect clothing from grease and sparks. Never wear loose clothing around a hot 
barbecue grill; it could inadvertently catch on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never touch charcoal or grill to see if it's hot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Electric cords should be placed away from walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charcoal grills should never be used indoors; toxic fumes could be fatal. 
Starter fluid should be capped immediately and placed a safe distance from the 
grill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never attempt to move a hot barbecue grill. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never discard hot coals where someone may step on them or where they could 
start a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure coals are cold before putting the barbecue grill away.

47 CERTIFIED MARKETS DOT REGION; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: STATE APPROVAL GUARANTEES QUALITY STANDARDS AND THAT A FARMER -- NOT 
A MIDDLEMAN -- IS DOING THE SELLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

There are 47 certified farmers' markets in Southern California -- stretching 
from Santa Maria south to Pacific Beach. Some are farmers' markets in the 
strictest sense, where the sole purpose is the direct sale of farm products. 
Others have expanded the concept to include educational demonstrations, 
entertainment and booths selling prepared foods or nonfood items. 
</P>
<P>
Before a farmer can sell commodities at a certified farmers' market, the county 
agricultural commissioner must check that the farmer actually grows what is 
sold. This inspection guarantees buyers they are purchasing directly from the 
farmer, a family member or employee. 
</P>
<P>
Certification also guarantees the produce meets the same quality and maturity 
standards required for supermarkets. It does, however, exempt the produce from 
normal standards for size and appearance, as well as packing and labeling 
requirements; therefore, some produce in the farmers' markets may vary from 
normal size and might be blemished. 
</P>
<P>
Certified farmers' markets are part of a direct marketing program of the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture. The program offers technical 
assistance to nonprofit organizations, local government agencies and one or 
more certified producers who want to open and operate a certified market. 
</P>

ABOUT WINE: MUMM ON NAME CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Domaine Mumm, the Napa Valley winery that is a joint venture between Seagram 
and G.H. Mumm of France, has quietly changed its name to Mumm Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the change was made because of the multitude of wineries in 
the Napa Valley that begin with the word domaine and "the fact that so few 
people realize that the word domaine simply means a house. 
</P>
<P>
We are not related to any of the other domaines around here." 
</P>
<P>
Penfolds Wines Pty. Ltd. of Australia has acquired another Australian wine 
company, the prestigious Lindemans Ltd. The sale price was not announced. 
</P>
<P>
"This opens up a whole new vista for Lindemans," said Hugh Matthews, U.S. 
general manager for the company. "Penfolds is a specialist red wine maker, and 
this can only help Lindemans make greater reds than they already have made." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews said nearly 100,000 cases of Lindemans wines are marketed in the 
United States, including an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon, designated St. 
George, and a wine called Limestone Ridge, a Shiraz/Cabernet blend. Both sell 
for about $22 a bottle and have received good reviews.

MOVABLE FEASTS: YES' SPREAD LEANS TO LIGHT, SHUNS NATIONAL IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"How come fettuccine's on the menu?" I asked the hostess as I picked up my 
order of Cantonese takeout. "Where do you think Marco Polo discovered pasta?" 
she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Before I could do a G. Burns on the G. Allen logic, she whisked me on an 
eye-dazzling tour of Yes Bar and Restaurant. Color-coordinated by none other 
than Peter Max (and designed by Santa Monica architect Johannes van Tilburg), 
Yes is a small village of spaces: a greenhouse, a gazebo, a banquet room and a 
big round bar done up in lipstick red, bubble-gum pink, sailcloth blue and lawn 
green. If you have your food delivered by their "express courier," you'll never 
know how adventurous this Hong Kong-based corporation's first Southern 
California venue is. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Hour is big business at Yes, and the combination appetizer platter 
(golden shrimp balls, cheese dumplings, scallion rolls, fried won tons and 
spring rolls) is fun to scarf down, seconds out of the kitchen, as you nurse 
your second mai tai. It's not the same experience when they are delivered. 
Those fried stuffed things turn greasy and leaden en route, all except for the 
large, simple, ground chicken won tons and the house specialty, those golden 
shrimp balls. 
</P>
<P>
I'm usually wary of adjectives but Yes's "golden" shrimp balls ($5.50 for a 
platter) are really just that. A smooth light paste within, the thinnest skin 
of battered crunch without, they're terrific. Fried calamari is fine too. Just 
skip the "garlic dip" accompaniment, which tastes like an execrable party soup 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
Yes's ace in the hole is lightness. They don't over-sauce, they're easy on the 
salt, they control the sugar on typically sweet dishes. But this light hand can 
go too far. None of the "spicy" or "fiery Sichuan" dishes come within 100 yards 
of making the eyes water or the mouth blaze. 
</P>
<P>
While not spicy by a long stretch, the quickly deep-fried "spicy" string beans 
with slivers of onion and garlic are particularly swell. "Spicy" Kung Pao 
prawns ($12.95) is actually a generous portion of plump, scallion-dotted shrimp 
bathed in a lady-like, chile-garlic sauce. Boneless, skinless apricot-ginger 
glazed chicken, while more apricot than ginger, is about a third as sweet as 
Cantonese duck. 
</P>
<P>
Both the magic wok flank steak salad ($8.50) and the Mandarin chicken salad 
(two sizes, $4.95 and $7.95) with their fresh greens, rich roasted flavors and 
light dressings would make a good lunch. (Make sure that the "specially baked 
sourdough loaf" -- or wheat bread -- is included with your order. Ours was 
not.) 
</P>
<P>
The very lightly stir-fried Yes vegetable deluxe ($7.75), an assortment of 
perky cruciferous things, is totally simple and satisfying with but a scant 
spoonful of the announced "garlic, Dijon mustard and wine sauce." 
</P>
<P>
Under the "pasta" heading (there are four Italianate dishes to one chow mein), 
both the chicken pesto pasta (tender, very creamy, very mild) and the pollo 
basilico fettuccine (light with fresh tomatoes, bright with basil threads) are 
tasty and, at $8.50 for large portions, well priced. The pedestrian salmon 
steak at $16.75 (and, on arrival, overcooked) is not. I'd also avoid the 
unctuously sweet, commercially made, overpriced desserts. 
</P>
<P>
When manager George Luk told me the menu would change regularly, I asked 
whether one of these days they'll serve rice. "We have no intention of becoming 
a Chinese restaurant," he said. "We're California cuisine." Ah, Toto, maybe 
we're not in Kowloon anymore, but we're not yet in Chinois. 
</P>
<P>

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: TIME FOR A 'HEALTHY SUMMER' PLAN

<P>
Vacation time spells freedom from work, and this casual, carefree attitude may 
stretch into our diets as well. In today's "What, me worry?" atmosphere, 
caution and concern about health are sacrificed on the altar of the great god 
of leisure. 
</P>
<P>
"I work so hard the rest of the year," goes the thinking, "that I deserve to 
gratify my every wish for these few weeks. Besides, what harm can it do?" 
</P>
<P>
No harm at all -- if you don't mind letting your health slide and your 
waistline spread. But don't expect us to take the killjoy role and warn you 
against breaking the rules. Au contraire: If you're determined to enjoy 
absolute freedom from sound nutrition during a vacation, here are some 
suggestions to help you get the job done right. 
</P>
<P>
Forget regular meals. Who needs the hassle of planning and cooking? Encourage 
your family to eat on the run. Stock the refrigerator with cold cuts, snack 
foods and soft drinks. You'll never have to sit down together at a regular 
meal; you can all gobble at different times. Try to eat out a lot, too, 
grabbing frankfurters, colas and ice cream at the ballpark or beach. 
</P>
<P>
If you must cook, make it a thick, juicy steak or a grilled hamburger layered 
in cheese, rather than chicken, which requires somewhat more time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh vegetables abound in summer, which is way too much work on vacation. Even 
frozen vegetables take time to heat up, so don't bother. If the family screams 
for a side dish, pass a bowl of potato chips. And why serve fresh fruit for 
dessert when store-bought cookies are so much easier? 
</P>
<P>
If you're taking a trip with loved ones, stop as often as possible at fast-food 
eateries. You'll be able to eat your fill of fat, sugar and sodium-laden foods 
such as fried chicken and fried clams, hamburgers slathered in catsup and 
pickles and thick shakes. There's nothing like a load of calories consumed at 
high speed to bring a family together. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of traveling with kids, one way to keep them quiet in the car is 
to fill their little mouths with sticky sweets and candies. This practice is a 
great money-saver too, because if you stuff them enough they'll be too bloated 
to eat anything when you sit down at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants, by the way, are a great place for throwing nutritional rules out 
the window. Don't forget to eat all the bread and butter they provide, and 
order twice as much food as usual because, hey, it's your vacation and you're 
supposed to be having fun, not worrying about little things like your heart or 
your weight. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not confine ourselves to eating. Those hot summer days are the 
perfect time to drink up. It's true that low-fat milk and icy fruit or 
vegetable drinks are just as refreshing and more nutritious than soda, but who 
wants to play safe? Any old stick-in-the-mud can have low-calorie iced tea, 
coffee with skim milk, or plain or sparkling water with a twist. But a real bon 
vivant can guzzle down two or three gin and tonics or four or more cans of soda 
in the course of an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At that high-calorie rate, you must be having fun, right? And you can double 
the thrill by eating nuts or chips hand-over-fist along with drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's not forget one of the most important guidelines of all: relaxing. 
Vacation means rest, so don't even think about exercising. If any misguided 
friends suggest taking a bicycle trip, playing tennis or swimming laps, tell 
them to take a hike -- without you. Make yourself comfy, lie back on the couch 
or hammock and drift into never-never land. On your sacred vacation, walking to 
the refrigerator is all the physical labor you need. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, maybe relaxing really isn't your style. If you're cut from 
more energetic cloth, our advice is just the opposite: Don't relax. Ever. And 
don't let your family relax, either. Drag them on a sightseeing trip and make 
sure you see everything, even if it means hustling. Night flights are nice, and 
they put everyone in a good mood. Long car trips are great too, especially if 
children are small. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you do, make sure the pace never slackens, because why did you come 
all this way if you weren't going to get the most for your time and money? And 
no whining, please. This is your vacation. 
</P>
<P>
What? None of the above sounds appealing? Then forget it all and follow a more 
sensible path. Because rest assured, you can have a happy holiday without 
putting health on hold and paying a price later. 
</P>
<P>
Question: A friend insists that her chronic fatigue results from a yeast 
infection. In response, she follows a somewhat odd diet and avoids refined 
sugar and alcohol. Can you tell me about this? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Called by at least three names -- "yeast connection," "candidiasis 
hypersensitivity" and "the missing diagnosis" -- this concept gained popularity 
as an explanation for chronic fatigue in two popular books of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Besides chronic fatigue, the "syndrome" includes a laundry list of symptoms 
from headache and lethargy to skin rashes, muscle aches, tearing eyes and 
bloating. It's also used to account for a variety of genito-urinary symptoms, 
among them vaginal burning and itching, prostatitis and even impotence. The 
long-term use of antibiotics is often singled out as the root cause. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientifically indefensible "treatments" have been offered at clinics 
specializing in treatment of the alleged problem. These include various dietary 
manipulations and, predictably, dietary supplements. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study of 100 individuals with chronic fatigue, conducted by 
investigators at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, eight 
believed their problem to be related to a "yeast connection." Their physical 
symptoms and laboratory profiles did not differ from the 92 others who came 
with a complaint of "chronic fatigue." Three of the eight thought they had an 
active candida infection. But in all cases, tests for the presence of the 
fungus were negative. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot? Yeast infections do occur, but evidence that chronic fatigue is 
related to Candida albicans is lacking. Alleviation of the problem, along with 
uncomfortable symptoms popularly ascribed to a yeast connection, is best left 
in the hands of a competent physician. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you straighten me out about which fruits and vegetables need to be 
blanched before they are frozen? 
</P>
<P>
A: In general, vegetables are blanched and fruits are not. Peppers and tomatoes 
are exceptions to the vegetable rule and can go into the freezer as is. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of blanching is to inactivate enzymes and prevent other chemical 
reactions that impair flavor, texture and color even at very low temperatures. 
Blanching also helps remove air from tissues, making it possible to pack a 
greater amount of vegetable into a small space. But with fruits, the adverse 
effect on flavor and texture make blanching impractical. However, using sugar 
syrup with ascorbic acid added to it helps prevent browning. 
</P>
<P>
Blanching is usually accomplished by pouring boiling water over the vegetables 
and letting them sit for a short period, and then quickly reducing the 
temperature by immersing vegetables in cold water to stop the cooking process. 
Blanching time varies from one vegetable to another. To ensure top quality, 
follow directions carefully. For information about this and other aspects of 
home preservation, try "Putting Food By" by Janet Greene, Ruth Hertzberg and 
Beatrice Vaughan (Stephen Greene Press). 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago I recall reading about a link between increasing intake of 
Vitamin A and reducing the risk of lung cancer. Did that idea ever pan out? 
</P>
<P>
A: The idea hasn't been disproved, but it has been modified. It's now 15 years 
since Norwegian researchers first reported that after taking cigarette smoking 
into account, the rate of lung cancer was one-third less among men whose 
Vitamin A intake was estimated to be above average compared with those with 
below-average intake. In that study, effects of preformed Vitamin A were not 
considered separately from those of carotenoids found in dark green vegetables 
and in yellow fruits and vegetables, which the body can convert to Vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>
Carotenes do more than function as precursors of Vitamin A. They can also act 
to prevent undesirable reactions in the body. Several years later, the first 
follow-up study among the Norwegians confirmed that the protective effect 
against lung cancer was linked to carrots and other vegetables, with an added 
contribution from milk, which contains both carotenes and preformed Vitamin A. 
Since then, other research has shown similar links. 
</P>
<P>
A different type of investigation, so-called case-controlled studies, have 
compared dietary intakes of individuals with and without the disease. Again, 
the generally consistent observation is that carotenoids -- but not preformed 
Vitamin A -- exert a protective influence. 
</P>
<P>
Using yet another approach, levels of beta carotene in blood samples that had 
been collected for other purposes were estimated. Levels in individuals who 
later developed lung cancer were lower than in those who didn't develop it. But 
whether the beneficial link is with carotenoids themselves or with some other 
factor associated with carotenoids is uncertain. Some controlled studies in 
which some subjects are given beta carotene and others are given a placebo are 
currently under way. Results of these studies should shed light on the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the link is to something in fruits and vegetables, especially 
those rich in carotenoids. A good case can be made for eating them in generous 
amounts. But remember that any protective effect pales compared to what you get 
by avoiding smoking.

THE VEGETARIAN: FRESH APRICOT SEASON: IT'S SHORT AND SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Don't blink, or you'll miss this year's apricots. The short season also 
accounts for the fact that there are so few recipes calling for fresh apricots; 
they're hardly around long enough to think of how to cook them. 
</P>
<P>
Fanny Farmer did, however, manage to dash off this dessert, made with a puree 
of fresh apricots that serves well as a pie filling or a topping for ice cream, 
yogurt or pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
APRICOT WHIP 
</P>
<P>
1 cup fresh apricots, pitted, sliced thin, but not peeled 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sugar or mild honey 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
3 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
Simmer apricots in water to cover 10 minutes. Drain. Puree in blender or food 
processor. Transfer to heavy-bottomed saucepan. 
</P>
<P>
Add sugar to apricot puree and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until 
thickened. Remove from heat and add lemon juice and salt. Let cool to lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Whisk 1/3 of whites into puree, then 
fold mixture into remaining whites. Spoon into 1-quart souffle dish. 
</P>
<P>
Place dish in pan of hot water and bake at 300 degrees until firm, about 45 
minutes. Serve warm. Makes 4 servings.

BACK TO BASICS: THE ART OF MAKING PESTO ; 
</P>
<P>
PESTLE OR PROCESSOR: FINE BASIL PESTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although fresh-cut basil is available in supermarket produce sections 
year-round, during the summer months this herb is also a popular plant in home 
gardens. Sweet basil planted in April or May has grown enough by now to yield 
leaves for making pesto, the classic Italian sauce. When harvesting basil, 
rather than cutting whole clusters, pinch off just the larger leaves and allow 
the smaller ones to continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Purists prepare pesto with a mortar and pestle, pounding and grinding the 
ingredients into a paste. Chop the basil (Step 1) and place in the mortar. The 
garlic may be added whole or minced, along with the pine nuts and grated 
Parmesan cheese (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
Using the pestle, mix and pound the ingredients (Step 3) until thoroughly 
combined and almost smooth. Gradually add the olive oil (Step 4), mixing until 
the sauce is about the consistency of creamed butter (Step 5). Season to taste 
with salt. 
</P>
<P>
Quality pesto may also be prepared with a food processor -- the trick being not 
to overprocess the ingredients. Instead of being a creamy, homogenized sauce, 
the finished pesto should have a somewhat gritty texture. 
</P>
<P>
Place the cheeses in the processor bowl fitted with the metal blade and process 
until well grated. Remove and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
With the motor running, drop the garlic through the feed tube (Step 6) and 
process until minced. Remove the cover and push the garlic down into the bowl 
with a rubber spatula (Step 7). Add the pine nuts (Step 8) and salt and process 
just until finely ground (Step 9). 
</P>
<P>
Add half the basil to the bowl (Step 10) and process with half-second pulses 
just until finely chopped (Step 11). Repeat with the remaining basil. Add the 
cheeses and pulse to combine. 
</P>
<P>
Turn on the motor and add the oil through the feed tube in a thin stream (Step 
12) so the sauce emulsifies. If you don't plan to use pesto immediately, place 
in a glass jar and seal by pouring a thin layer of olive oil over the top. 
Refrigerate up to four days. Pesto also freezes well; thaw in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Celestino Drago, then executive chef at Chianti restaurant, won grand 
prize for his pesto recipe in the Second Annual Basil Festival at Malibu. We 
have adapted it for food processor preparation. 
</P>
<P>
BASIL PESTO 
</P>
<P>
3/4 ounce Pecorino cheese 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 ounces Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan) cheese 
</P>
<P>
12 medium cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
3 ounces fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Place Pecorino and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses in food processor container 
fitted with metal blade. Process until finely grated. Remove and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
With motor running, drop garlic through chute into food processor container and 
process until very fine. Remove processor lid and push garlic down into 
container with rubber spatula. 
</P>
<P>
Add pine nuts and salt and process until nuts are grated. Add basil leaves in 2 
to 3 batches and process with half-second pulses until finely chopped. Add 
reserved cheeses and pulse to combine. 
</P>
<P>
With motor running, gradually add oil. Makes about 1 cup.

CIVILIZED ART OF TAKING TEA OFFERS RETREAT IN FAST WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The tea room was an oasis in the dreary waste of existence where weary 
travelers could meet to drink from the common spring of art appreciation. The 
ceremony was an improvised drama whose plot was woven about the tea, the 
flowers, and the paintings. Not a color to disturb the tone of the room, not a 
sound to mar the rhythm of things, not a gesture to obtrude on the harmony, not 
a word to break the unity of the surroundings, all movements to be performed 
simply and naturally -- such were the aims of the tea ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Okakuro Kakuzo "The Book of Tea" 1906 
</P>
<P>
In his novel "Portrait of a Lady," Henry James, an American expatriate who 
savored the delights of English existence, wrote, "There are few hours in life 
more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." 
</P>
<P>
It's refreshing to know that, today in North County, one can still while away 
an agreeable hour or two in establishments that have dedicated their afternoons 
to ceremoniously serving tea in the grand English tradition. 
</P>
<P>
For some, a cordial tea has become a refreshing alternative to happy hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking tea this way is very much an art," said Kathy Wagner, director of 
marketing for The Inn L'Auberge in Del Mar. "It's British in style, and very 
elegant." 
</P>
<P>
Afternoon tea at L'Auberge, set in a sumptuous lobby with marble floors and 
plush, softly colored carpeting, is not so much a meal as an indulgence. A 
tuxedoed pianist plays soothingly amid ferns that arch gracefully above 
comfortable, overstuffed chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The fare is refreshingly light: finger sandwiches of watercress, smoked salmon 
and cucumber, as well as the essential scones with Devonshire cream and fruit 
preserves, and a choice of pastry or petit fours. L'Auberge serves tea Monday 
through Saturday from 3 to 5 p.m. It features five specially blended teas, the 
most popular being passion Fruit. champagne, sherry and port wine are also 
served. 
</P>
<P>
The tea "attracts a lot of different types of people," said Wagner. "We have 
the ladies who come from Rancho Santa Fe, Fairbanks Ranch and Del Mar, but it 
really appeals to all kinds of people. It can be an escape for them. It's so 
very civilized, and that European sort of etiquette is very soothing." 
</P>
<P>
Guests at the Del Mar Inn can also partake of an elegant afternoon tea, which 
Phyllis Elliot has coordinated for the past six years. A fourth-generation 
hotelier, Elliott was raised at the Empress Hotel in Victoria, British 
Columbia. She prepares the inn's freshly baked delicacies from old family 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
The complimentary tea -- offered to guests only -- is served in the inn's 
quaint library between 3 and 4:30 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
Farther inland, in the rolling countryside of Rancho Bernardo, tea for the 
public as well as guests is served at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Low-beamed ceilings and wood paneling -- along with a set of antlers over the 
fireplace -- give afternoon tea in the lobby of the inn a rustic, country feel. 
Cozy settings of couches, tables and chairs among antiques offer a relaxing 
respite from the pressures of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 4 p.m. daily, the inn offers a Harney &amp; Sons tea blend from 
England, as well as a variety of finger sandwiches, cookies and pastries. The 
atmosphere is a tad less formal than that of L'Auberge, but every bit as 
enjoyable. In fact, the lobby of the Rancho Bernardo Inn was so full of tea 
drinkers one recent afternoon that seating was at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been serving afternoon tea for about seven years," said Dasha Safarik, 
the concierge at the inn. "It's the most popular event of the day, and we do it 
just for the pleasure of our guests, so they can come in here and relax in a 
comfortable setting. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make it pretentious, or use it as a marketing tool, just a place to 
mingle or to gather before dinner. Some people come in right off the golf 
course or tennis court, or stop in on their way home from work or shopping." 
</P>
<P>
The drinking of tea -- for centuries a revered and soothing tradition in Asian 
and British cultures -- is still not an everyday event for most Americans. 
Perhaps the nation's mixed emotions about tea date back to the Boston Tea 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
The first written history of tea, the Ch'a Ching, or "Tea Book," was recorded 
about A.D. 800 by Lu Yu, the patron saint of tea in China. 
</P>
<P>
In his description of the best quality leaf, Lu Yu wrote that it should "curl 
like the dewlaps of a bull, crease like the leather boots of a Tartar horseman, 
unfold like a mist rising over a ravine, and soften as gently as fine earth 
swept by rain." 
</P>
<P>
Tea didn't come to Europe until the middle of the 16th Century, when Portugal 
established a trading center in Macao. 
</P>
<P>
In 1840, Anna, seventh Duchess of Bedford, grew weary of the day's activities, 
as well as a little hungry. Since this sinking feeling seemed to afflict her 
almost every day at about 4 o'clock, she began to practice what would become a 
British tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, the practice of taking tea has evolved into two distinct 
forms: afternoon and high tea, the latter being the more substantial. Although 
there is a widespread misconception that high tea is the formal tea, it 
actually refers to a family meal that is served early in the evening -- a 
working man's supper. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike high fashion or high society, high tea has nothing to do with starch and 
propriety. Also known as "meat tea," high tea has the charm of easy 
hospitality, often serving as the evening meal and frequently made with the 
leftovers from a huge lunch, also served with tea. 
</P>
<P>
Although the history of taking tea in North County is relatively short, its 
soothing effects can be a proper pairing with the increasingly hectic pace of 
daily life. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, North County's tea rooms are still outnumbered by its beaches.

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: AN ATTEMPT AT CLASSIC TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Mention Dante and everyone thinks of the Inferno, a strikingly nasty epic poem 
to be sure, but, as many forget, only one-third of the Divine Comedy trilogy, 
which also includes Paradiso and Purgatorio. 
</P>
<P>
There's all sorts of allegorical stuff in each volume about the Guelphs and the 
Ghibellines, who were the Republicans and Democrats of 14th Century Florentine 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Dante's Restaurant in Mira Mesa; the place is itself a kind of 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
The motto "Continental dining at its finest" takes the restaurant back to a 
pre-nouvelle era when "Continental" meant class and implied such things as 
crisp table linens and thoroughly professional waiters in black tie. The term 
also indicated a menu that seesawed between French and Italian according to the 
lights of the chef or management but always, always included onion soup. 
</P>
<P>
Dante's menu includes onion soup and inclines strongly to the Italian side, 
although there are several steaks as well as prime rib and the once-ubiquitous 
but now rarely encountered London broil. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of style, the place much resembles a comfortable East Coast suburban 
eatery of the 1950s or '60s, with brick walls, reasonably low lights, quilted 
maroon banquettes and carefully set tables (the table settings include a couple 
of bottles of wine each as a none-too-subtle hint). It seems unsurprising that, 
whenever there is a lull in the conversation, one hears Frank Sinatra quietly 
crooning over the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees begin at $9.95 and end just shy of $20, with most priced neatly in the 
middle, and these sums buy a good deal of food. Meals include both soup and 
salad and, as a very pleasant touch, open with a complimentary appetizer plate 
of decent fried zucchini sticks and excellent salami. 
</P>
<P>
Among the restaurant's minor pretensions to style is an insistence on cart 
service of the soup and salad. A server recently ladled out bowls of a potage 
du jour that he labeled shrimp bisque, which it did not seem to be, although 
this chowder-like soup packed with bay shrimp did have a very pleasant flavor. 
The salad, tossed table-side, considerably surpassed the usual house mix and 
included more shrimp along with chopped bacon and egg, to which a honey-mustard 
dressing added a fine sweet-pungent note. 
</P>
<P>
The menu offers but four pastas, none terribly interesting except, perhaps, the 
gnochinni, or small dumplings in a choice of meat or marinara sauces. The 
entree list runs to much greater length and includes a small filet mignon in 
sherry sauce paired with a choice of chicken or seafood cannelloni; duck in 
orange sauce and veal Oscar (both standards of Continental cuisine); a house 
version of scampi that includes capers, mushrooms and brandy; roast chicken; 
beef liver steak; a simple New York steak and roast pork tenderloin seasoned 
with garlic. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood cannelloni was sampled on its own and found disappointing in terms 
of sauce and the soggy crepe wrapper; the filling of mixed shrimp, crab and 
fish lived up to its billing but was less than ravishing. 
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian tiger shrimp came off much better, the shrimp themselves cooked 
just to the juicy stage and the creamy white sauce rather nicely flavored with 
capers, mushrooms and wine. The kitchen arranged the shrimp over a rice pilaf 
worthy of the name, the grains firm and separate rather than stewed into the 
goo that usually gets the name "rice pilaf" at area eateries. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetbreads are not everyone's dish -- from the point of view of both diners 
and of cooks -- but Dante's serves them anyway. The very simple treatment calls 
for the meat to be breaded, sauteed and finished with mushrooms and a few drops 
of wine. Sweetbreads have so mild a flavor (their virtue lies in the extreme 
delicacy of the meat) that a highly seasoned sauce usually accompanies them, 
and something of the sort would help Dante's version, which needs a strong 
flavor boost. 
</P>
<P>
An outside supplier caters the dessert tray, which concentrates mostly on 
elaborate cheesecakes. The best choice, however, would be the white 
chocolate-covered "truffles" that enclose a tasty heart of pureed fruit; one of 
these can, in fact, bring an interlude at Dante's to a rather paradisal 
conclusion.

COMMUNITY PROFILE / DEL MAR : GROWTH IS THIS BEACHSIDE CITY'S BIGGEST PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE, BUT SOME LIKE IT THAT WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Seems like Del Mar would be a tough sell. It lacks public schools, industry, 
museums and RV hookups. There is no university, movie house, nightclub or golf 
course. Senior citizens do not have a playground and neither do Little 
Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
The place is only 2 square miles. Traffic is stymied by stop signs and traffic 
signals and narrow hilly streets are incomplete or as twisted as a Hollywood 
juniper. The library is housed in a trailer. Anybody wanting to hear a concert 
or buy a new car must leave town. The airport disappeared, the bathhouse burned 
down, and the public swimming pool drowned in the surf. When people try to 
fight City Hall, it fights back. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this city of 5,225 souls 20 miles north of downtown San Diego has a 
lure, a conjugation of the beauty in its many trees, wooden homes and seaside 
location; its tininess; the race track; and the good restaurants, first-class 
hostelries, shops and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar is the Carmel of Southern California, the rare beauty that keeps her 
looks while aging. 
</P>
<P>
But is it not discommodious to lack so many of the amenities most communities 
have? Here is Grant Larson, 41, a lifetime Del Mar resident born in San Diego 
(There is no hospital in Del Mar): 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, there are plenty of beach-type things to do -- surfing, swimming, jogging, 
walking, building a sand castle, reading a book, laying down, . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Larson has been a lifeguard since 1966. He would not live elsewhere, although 
he sees things he dislikes. 
</P>
<P>
"The increased congestion," he said, "especially automobile traffic." 
</P>
<P>
That is a lament heard frequently. Former Mayor Lew Hopkins, for instance, 
blames some of the traffic on residents of "many communities" that use Del 
Mar's main street, Camino del Mar, as an alternate to Interstate 5. They 
include staff and students from the University of California, San Diego, and 
workers at the scientific and medical facilities on Torrey Pines Mesa, many of 
whom live north of Del Mar. And he blames North City West residents, who 
frequently cross the hill to visit. 
</P>
<P>
"Our growth has been evolutionary, not in population," Hopkins, a retired 
admiral living in Del Mar since 1974, said. "But areas around have grown. Del 
Mar is a very desirable place to live. It's kind of laid back." 
</P>
<P>
But it is not laid back when the issue is growth versus no growth. The City 
Council comprises "Greens," who want open space. "Greens" call their foes 
"Grays," who desire "concrete." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar has an unusual city ordinance, resulting from citizen demand, that 
requires a public vote before any large commercial development may be 
constructed downtown, which basically is Camino Del Mar and two blocks of 15th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically we're about 50-50 divided between people who want changes and 
not," Hopkins said. "Even the vote for incorporation (1959) was around 50-50. . 
. . The Inn lost the first time. The Plaza won by a 47-vote margin." 
</P>
<P>
The Inn L'Auberge, a 123-room hotel on the site of the former Del Mar Hotel, 
and Del Mar Plaza, a complex of shops, galleries and restaurants, both opened 
in 1989. Both are at the intersection of 15th Street and Camino del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Those two enterprises raised the business tide in the little seashell of a 
town, with one restaurant in the hotel and three -- Epazote, Pacifica Del Mar 
and Il Fornaio Cucina Italiana -- in the plaza (plus art galleries, a food 
market, clothing stores, etc). The plaza eateries are looking to rival as 
hangouts Bully's North, Baja Grill and Fish Market, Carlos and Annie's and Cafe 
Del Mar downtown; Poseidon Restaurant and Jake's Del Mar at the beach; and The 
Brigantine on the north rim. 
</P>
<P>
Even in those restaurant-bars, much of the crowd is from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The median household income is a sturdy $39,000-plus, rents are high and 
housing is among the most expensive in the county, so plenty of folks cannot 
afford to live in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
H. K. Throneson, retired Marine colonel, ex-educator and local historian, 
points out that many people who live here couldn't afford to move in now. 
Throneson used as an example the home he and his wife, Marge, built in 1959. 
They paid $6,250 for a lot with a panoramic view and $21,000 for construction 
of a two-level redwood home of four bedrooms and two baths, then adorned the 
grounds with fish ponds, big trees "and a tremendous amount of stone work." 
</P>
<P>
The house next door, which was built 10 years later on a slightly smaller lot 
and not so fully finished, just sold for nearly $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Throneson, a collaborator with the late Nancy Hanks Ewing on her 1988 book 
($35) about Del Mar, would rather talk history. He relates how: 
</P>
<P>
By June 1885, Jacob Shell Taylor owned outright or with Theodore M. Loop 338.11 
oceanfront acres after an investment of $1,800; how Taylor filed his plat map 
with the county recorder on Oct. 7, 1885; built at the foot of 10th Street the 
30-room Casa del Mar, a dance pavilion, bathhouse, natatorium and several other 
structures. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The flood of 1889 isolated Del Mar and killed tourism from Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. . . . The South Coast Land Co., starting in 1905, invested 
heavily to again make Del Mar a vacation retreat and, in 1909, built the 
Tudor-style Stratford Inn (renamed Del Mar Hotel and razed in 1969).

CONCERTS ON GREEN WILL BEGIN JULY 4

In the arena of outdoor summer concerts, Symphony on the Green is North 
County's answer to the Boston Pops and the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The series, held on the driving range of the Rancho Bernardo Inn, opens on the 
Fourth of July with a concert by the Lettermen trio and the Musical Knights 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Composer and band leader Henry Mancini performs July 28; the San Diego 
Symphony, under the baton of guest conductor Gary Sheldon, plays Aug. 19. 
Master of ceremonies for the three-part series is Al Deahl, a Rancho Bernardo 
resident and host of the KPBS-FM program "Pacific Ballroom," a retrospective of 
Swing band recordings. 
</P>
<P>
The series' opener July 4th combines '60s nostalgia with the evergreen sounds 
of pre-World War II Big-Band sonorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Lettermen won nine gold records during the 1960s and early 1970s. "Goin' 
Out of My Head," "Hurts So Bad," and "Summer Place" are among the tunes for 
which these masters of smooth harmony are known. Lead singer Tony Butala is the 
sole founding member still with the trio. 
</P>
<P>
Musical Knights Orchestra, which got its start in Oakland back in 1923, was 
known for its novelty tunes. It was founded by Horace Heidt, who died in 1986. 
His son, Horace Heidt Jr., has taken over the band, and continues to use his 
dad's arrangements. In addition to continuing his father's legacy, the younger 
Heidt leads the band at the Los Angeles Raiders home football games. 
</P>
<P>
"Heidt was one of the pioneer radio bands," Deahl said. "One of his 
better-known shows was the Hires Root Beer Radio Show, which flourished in the 
early 1940s." Comedian Art Carney and singer Gordon MacRae both launched their 
careers with the original Musical Knights, Deahl said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 28, Mancini will appear for the third time at Symphony on the Green. 
Mancini holds the all-time attendance record for the series, according to board 
member Nanette Strull. In 1982, Mancini drew more than 7,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini's finesse on the podium is matched by his fluent composing pen. He is 
best known for his easy-listening hits "Moon River," "Days of Wine and Roses," 
and "Dear Heart" -- not to mention his trademark "Pink Panther Theme." 
</P>
<P>
The season closes Aug. 19 with the San Diego Symphony's all-Gershwin program, 
featuring piano soloist Robert Taub. Among the numbers to be played are 
"Rhapsody in Blue," excerpts from "Porgy and Bess," variations on "I've Got 
Rhythm," and "Strike Up the Band." 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Bernardo site seats 2,000 and accommodates many more picnickers on 
the adjacent hillsides, where an amplification system beams the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Symphony on the Green was started in 1972 by Chris Christopherson, who was a 
vice president of the San Diego Symphony board and a Rancho Bernardo resident. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought it would be fun to bring the symphony out here for a concert, and 
he made the arrangements with the developer to use the site at the driving 
range. For that first concert they sold very few tickets in advance, but the 
night of the concert, over 6000 came," Strull said 
</P>
<P>
Symphony on the Green patrons can bring picnics from home or purchase food at 
the site. 
</P>

DATE RAPE ALLEGED AT USC FRATERNITY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: GROUP'S MEMBERS PARADED IN FRONT OF VICTIM, POLICE ALLEGE. MISDEMEANOR 
CHARGES ARE EXPECTED, BUT PROSECUTORS SAY THEY LACK EVIDENCE FOR STRONGER 
ACTION.

<P>
A female USC student who says she was the victim of a date rape on Fraternity 
Row last December was moments later subjected to a parade of frat members "in 
various states of undress" -- an event the men apparently regarded as a kind of 
prank, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although prosecutors concluded there was insufficient evidence to file rape 
charges, police are expected to seek misdemeanor charges, possibly sexual 
battery or indecent exposure, against one or more fraternity members. 
</P>
<P>
USC officials said they will conduct an investigation that could lead to 
disciplinary action against members of Alpha Tau Omega (ATO), the fraternity at 
which the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"If indeed the event had taken place the way the D.A. has described, I am 
shocked, dismayed and disappointed," said James Dennis, USC's vice president of 
student affairs. "I know of no one in the university community who would 
condone such behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Noel Cunningham said he is "90% certain" that 
detectives will ask the city attorney to proceed with a prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to exhaust every possible legal avenue," Cunningham said. "In fact, it 
appeared to us she was a victim of a conspiracy to play this game with her." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said that the woman appeared to be a victim of a ritualistic prank 
that fraternitY members called "Just Playing Through." Investigators said that 
in this case, a few ATO members wearing golf caps and carrying golf clubs may 
have exposed themselves to the woman who later accused her date of rape. 
</P>
<P>
At least two fraternity members acknowledged that the incident took place, 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Lucienne Coleman, supervisor of the sex crimes 
and child abuse division. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Dennis said the university, at the request of police and the alleged 
victim, had delayed its investigation pending the district attorney's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis suggested that individual students, and possibly the ATO chapter, would 
be disciplined if campus officials corroborate the findings of police and the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"I know members of the university community will be very, very concerned," 
Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's decision not to seek felony charges against the 
21-year-old ATO member accused of rape capped a controversy that surfaced in 
April, when the alleged victim made a formal complaint to police. 
</P>
<P>
The 4 1/2-month delay in reporting the incident prevented police from obtaining 
any physical evidence of rape and was a key factor in the decision not to file 
felony charges, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that the woman, whose name was not released, met the 
21-year old man in a bar near campus, the 901 Club. She said there was some 
mutual attraction and, after consuming four beers and two shots of whiskey, she 
accompanied the male back to his frat house, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim acknowledged that she consented to kissing, fondling and 
removal of some clothing but was forced to have sexual intercourse. The suspect 
told police that penetration never occurred because he was too drunk. 
</P>
<P>
After interviews with the alleged victim and two friends in whom she confided, 
prosecutors concluded it was unclear whether the woman had resisted before 
penetration. "If she didn't make her protestation known until after penetration 
occurred, the crime of rape did not occur," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks that followed, the woman told investigators, she was frequently 
harassed and teased by fraternity members. According the district attorney's 
report, the harassment prompted her to seek help from a USC counselor. She then 
went to police with the accusation that she was raped. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1989-90 school year, three other "date rape" allegations were aired 
before a student conduct review panel, Dennis said. The panel, he said, did not 
decide whether rape had occurred, but in all three instances found that the 
male student had either "harmed" or "threatened to harm" the female student. 
The offending students were suspended for a year. 
</P>
<P>
A similar panel will be convened to air allegations regarding the incident at 
ATO house, Dennis said.

DEPUTIES OK SERVICE LIMITS IN DRUG UNITS; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: TWO UNIONS AGREE TO A PLAN THAT WOULD RESTRICT OFFICERS 
TO 5-YEAR STINTS ON NARCOTICS DUTY. THE REFORM, DESIGNED TO LIMIT MISCONDUCT, 
COMES IN THE WAKE OF A MONEY-SKIMMING SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and two unions have tentatively 
agreed to limit deputies to five-year stints as narcotics investigators in the 
first administrative reform after suspensions of 26 narcotics officers in a 
money-skimming scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the Sheriff's Department and two union groups 
representing more than 7,000 officers must be ratified by the Board of 
Supervisors. The matter has not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the longer an individual is in a unit with certain kinds of 
temptations, it does to some extent increase the possibility of misconduct," 
Assistant Sheriff Jerry Harper said this week in explaining the five-year time 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 10 narcotics officers indicted in March on federal charges related 
to the alleged theft of $1.4 million in drug money had served with the 
department for more than 14 years. Records indicate that at least half of those 
indicted would have been transferred out of narcotics units had the five-year 
"sunset" rule been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Other reforms proposed by Sheriff Sherman Block -- including financial 
disclosure for some employees -- remain under negotiation with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said that, besides reducing the potential for misconduct, the five-year 
limit would also permit more sheriff's deputies to serve on the narcotics 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement would also limit officers to five years of service in 
the sheriff's vice and special investigations units. A seven-year limit would 
be imposed on members of the special weapons teams. 
</P>
<P>
The rule would apply only to new members of all the units. At the end of 
special assignments, officers would have to leave the units for five or seven 
years before another tour of duty. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department has no limit on service for narcotics 
officers. Vice detectives serve a maximum of 18 months, and internal affairs 
investigators are limited to two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs and the Professional Peace 
Officers Assn., which represents sergeants and lieutenants, said they supported 
the time limits as a means of promoting movement within the department. 
</P>
<P>
"Management felt that the longer you stayed in an assignment the more chance of 
something (negative) occurring," said Art Reddy, president of the Professional 
Peace Officers Assn. "We do not feel that way at all. But we think that it will 
probably afford more people an opportunity to work special assignments." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the March indictments, Block also said he intended to institute a 
policy of financial disclosure for some members of the department. Although he 
would not identify the assignments that would require financial reviews, they 
reportedly include narcotics investigators, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The indicted deputies allegedly lived beyond their means, using drug money to 
buy boats, vacation homes or other costly items. 
</P>
<P>
Union and Sheriff's Department officials declined to discuss the financial 
disclosure issue, but a source familiar with the employees' position said the 
department wants full financial reports on some employees and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies are particularly distressed by the suggestion that spouses might be 
forced to disclose personal financial information, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, an attorney for the deputies union, declined to comment on the 
financial disclosure proposal. But Shinee said that officers he represents in 
the West Covina Police Department vehemently opposed a similar proposal. "They 
were very upset, because they saw no valid reason for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers in the Philadelphia Police Department also fought against financial 
disclosure, in 1986, but a federal appellate court ruled that officers applying 
for sensitive positions could be required to disclose financial data such as 
debts, loans, income sources and a host of other information. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Harper said the department will limit its reforms to the 
"sunset" rules and financial disclosure. He said that unlike some other major 
departments, the Sheriff's Department will not ask potential narcotics officers 
to submit to special psychological tests. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chicago Police Department, officers must submit to a battery of 
psychological tests and interviews before serving on narcotics teams. The 
screening is designed to eliminate officers who are unstable, antisocial or 
prone to alcohol abuse or theft, said Ed Wodnicki, the department's deputy 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department gets enough information on its 
employees by reviewing their job histories.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT CONVICTED OF STABBING AND ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old transient was convicted Wednesday in the stabbing and robbery of 
an elderly woman in a Vons supermarket in Santa Monica last March, a crime that 
has fueled debate over the city's policies regarding its large homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury acquitted James Earl Tillman of attempted murder in the 
assault on 89-year-old Frances Finnen but found him guilty of robbery and 
assault with a deadly weapon with intent to cause great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's findings, along with a possible five-year penalty for an earlier 
robbery conviction in Nevada, means that Tillman could face a maximum prison 
term of up to 18 years. Sentencing is set for July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Dror Toister said Tillman was "pleased" that the jury decided 
that he had not tried to kill Finnen, who suffered a two-inch puncture wound 
after being stabbed with a pair of scissors. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict disappointed political activists who have seized on Santa Monica's 
growing transient crime issue in an effort to unseat City Atty. Robert Myers. 
They say Myers' liberal policies and reluctance to prosecute nonviolent 
misdemeanors have all but invited the homeless into the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very upset about it," said Leslie Dutton, organizer of the initiative 
drive that seeks to make the city attorney's job elective instead of 
appointive. "Something's wrong here with the system."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING DESTROYED BY FIRE STARTED IN 
DUMPSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance police continued their search Wednesday for a suspected arsonist who 
started a fire that destroyed a two-story building in old downtown early 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which caused an estimated $1 million in losses, gutted the Value 
Village thrift store on Sartori Avenue and damaged two adjacent buildings, 
officials said. The fire started in a dumpster behind the building. Police 
believe the same person is responsible for another five to six dumpster fires 
set that night.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were arrested on suspicion of committing a yearlong string of sexual 
assaults by abducting women from San Fernando Valley streets at gunpoint and 
raping them on a remote ranch, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Theodore Conyers, 26, of Acton and Paul McDaniels, 23, 
of Canyon Country raped women ranging in age from 12 to 31 in the guest house 
of a ranch in Acton, northeast of Santa Clarita, owned by a relative of 
Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were expected to be charged today with rape and kidnaping. Arraignment 
also was scheduled today in Van Nuys Municipal court. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dave Dempsy declined to say how many women allegedly were raped. One 
of the two men has confessed to a string of such assaults, but thus far 
detectives have been able to identify only some of the victims, police said. 
Detectives hope other victims will come forward.

FORMER PRESIDENT OF NAACP GETS 6-MONTH SENTENCE FOR LOAN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former president of a local NAACP chapter was sentenced Wednesday to six 
months in jail and ordered to pay more than $63,000 for lying on a home loan 
application he submitted to a thrift where he worked as a high-ranking 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony M. Essex, who headed the Los Angeles branch of the civil rights group, 
also was ordered by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Kelleher to serve 640 
hours of community service and five years' probation for providing falsified 
W-2 and 1040 tax forms to Founders Savings &amp; Loan Assn. for the loan in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
He will begin serving his jail term on or before Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Essex, 33, pleaded guilty in March to three counts of defrauding Founders, a 
now-insolvent thrift where he worked as a vice president and loan administrator 
in 1984 and 1985. He admitted he both exaggerated his income to obtain a 
$121,500 home loan and knowingly filed a false commercial loan application for 
a friend identified as Janet Caldwell. Both have defaulted on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the guilty pleas, the U.S. attorney's office dropped seven other 
fraud charges it had filed against Essex, a civil rights firebrand who was the 
youngest person ever to lead the local NAACP chapter. He lost the chapter 
presidency in a 1989 election. 
</P>
<P>
Essex also has agreed to work with the federal government in its investigation 
of Founders' collapse -- and he had hoped his cooperation would help him to 
avoid a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to express my deepest regrets for my wrongdoing, for breaking the 
law," Essex told Kelleher. "As God be my witness, I will never do this again . 
. . I ask that you temper your decision with mercy." 
</P>
<P>
In ordering Essex jailed, Kelleher insisted that "he's not going to walk." 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of (crime) will not be tolerated," said Kelleher, who also told 
Essex to pay the thrift $63,745.50. "It's this type of self-dealing that has 
created the chaos" now gripping the S&amp;L industry and that forced Founders 
onto the U.S. government's list of insolvent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Ramsey, who called the sentence "disappointing," 
contended that Essex did not deserve jail time. Although neither said so 
directly, he and Essex have insinuated that Essex was targeted for 
investigation partly because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who line their pockets with gold" as a result of S&amp;L 
fraud, said Ramsey. "There are people driving his and her Rolls-Royces." 
</P>
<P>
Founders officials, who fired Essex in November, 1985, sparked the federal 
government's investigation of Essex with several criminal referrals that 
accused him of improprieties, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory D. Schetina.

PORTER RANCH DEVELOPMENT GETS COUNCIL PANEL'S PRELIMINARY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel granted preliminary approval Wednesday to a 
plan that would transform the 1,300-acre Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth into a 
residential-commercial complex that would house 11,000 people and employ 21,000 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-0 vote by the Board of Referred Powers came after two hours of debate 
that included testy exchanges between Councilman Hal Bernson and Los Angeles 
school board member Julie Korenstein, who contended that the developer had not 
set aside enough of the land for schools. 
</P>
<P>
Both elected officials represent the Porter Ranch area. Bernson has supported 
the plan -- which has been in the making since 1987 -- and Korenstein has 
emerged as its most prominent official foe. 
</P>
<P>
The plan given preliminary approval Wednesday regulates construction of a 
massive project on one of the largest undeveloped parcels remaining in the city 
of Los Angeles. Although school site questions dominated Wednesday's debate, 
traffic impact has been the major objection of the project's critics in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is scheduled to go to the full council for consideration on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
The project, totaling 6 million square feet of commercial-retail construction 
and 3,395 residential units, could be expected to generate 150,602 vehicle 
trips daily, according to the city's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Porter Ranch developer is now required to set aside, until 
the year 2000, a seven-acre site for an elementary school. The plan says an 
additional 15-acre site "could be reserved" for the school district to build a 
junior high school at some later date. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein argued that the developer should also be required to reserve a high 
school site. And she urged that the district be given more time to elect to buy 
the reserved sites. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who sits on the Board of Referred Powers, saw a 
silver lining of sorts in developing the huge property. The proposed Porter 
Ranch commercial core will act as a welcome "job magnet" for the growing 
population of the north San Fernando Valley and the Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys, he said.

DOW SPUTTERS TO A SMALL GAIN LATE IN SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks shrugged off bearish news Wednesday on interest rates and fought back to 
score small gains at the close. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve's so-called Beige Book of regional economic conditions said 
the economy continues to grow slowly with little change in inflation trends. 
</P>
<P>
The report was seen as another clue that Fed interest rate policy is on hold 
for now, dashing hopes of lower rates. The news kept the Dow Jones industrial 
average down slightly for most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dow recovered late to close up 1.74 at 2,895.30. Most broader indexes 
also gained. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 0.63 to 359.10, and the 
NASDAQ over-the-counter composite rose 0.27 to 460.80. 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest indexes was the NASDAQ industrial index, which is heavy 
with high-tech companies. It added 1.23 to 493.47, showing investors continue 
to be interested in smaller tech stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said that selling after the Fed's report lacked conviction and that 
volume was light. Still, declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 668 up, 
777 down and 555 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 137.42 million shares, up from 134.93 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Drug stocks rose, which some traders said reflected investors' desire to buy 
stocks where earnings are likely to be strong even if the economy slips. 
Schering-Plough rose 1 to 46 after the firm reaffirmed expectations that 1990 
earnings per share will increase 18% to 20%. Upjohn rose 2 1/8 to 42 1/8; 
Abbott Labs added 1 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
Syncor International of Chatsworth rose 3/8 to 9 5/8 after signing a pact to 
distribute one of Squibb's radioactive drugs that is used in diagnostics. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals of Laguna Hills plunged 5/8 to 3, after rising 13/16 
Tuesday on speculation about one of the company's AIDS treatment drugs. Federal 
regulators have been skeptical about the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Oil and oil services stocks were mostly higher despite another fall in oil 
prices. Arco rose 1 1/8 to 117 7/8, Texaco added 3/4 to 58, Unocal rose 3/8 to 
28 5/8 and Baker Hughes rose 1/4 to 28 3/8. But Dekalb Energy slumped 2 3/4 to 
23 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Among growth stocks, Circus Circus added 1 1/8 to 61 7/8 on the strength of its 
opening of the Excalibur hotel in Las Vegas. Elsewhere, restaurant chain 
Showbiz/Pizza Time plunged 3 1/2 to 22 1/4 after an analyst lowered 
current-quarter earnings estimates, though the analyst said he expected good 
growth in the next two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed slightly higher in thin trading. The 225-share Nikkei 
index closed 47.38 points higher at 32,087.76. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks inched up. The Financial Times 100-share index rose 1.5 to 
close at 2,371.2. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index closed up 12.81 at 
1,849.55, continuing Tuesday's rebound.

Beige Book Report Sinks Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices sank as the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on the 
economy reinforced a belief that the central bank won't lower interest rates 
soon. 
</P>

In the junk bond market, prices of RJR Nabisco bonds closed sharply higher in 
heavy trading as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. announced plans to retire a 
large part of $6 billion in debt used to finance its record buyout of RJR. 
</P>
<P>
Some RJR bonds jumped on the KKR news. The 14.07% bonds due in 2009 gained more 
than $6 per $100 in face value to $96.75. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield rose to 8.51% from 8.47% Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Fed report, T-bonds were pushed lower by concerns about a possible 
oversupply of bonds. The Treasury said it plans to sell $11.25 billion in 
two-year notes and $8.25 billion in four-year notes next week. The amount of 
the two-year notes was $250 million greater than anticipated, fueling concerns 
about whether the market can absorb the supply.

<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, up from 8.125% Tuesday.

Gorbachev Speech Boosts the Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained slightly against most other major currencies in light 
trading, boosted by concern about political uncertainty in the Soviet Union, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose domestically after a mixed performance overseas. On New York's 
Commodity Exchange, gold rose $1.40 an ounce to $350.50. Later, Republic 
National Bank in New York reported a bid of $349.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was helped by a comment from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
that soon he might no longer be leader of the Communist Party, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
At a party meeting in Moscow, Gorbachev acknowledged that he could lose his 
party post at a national congress in less than two weeks. The news caused a 
flight to the dollar in the currency markets, typical in times of uncertainty, 
said Andrew Hodge, analyst at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York. 
</P>

The dollar inched up to 153.93 yen in New York, from 153.49 Tuesday.COMMODITIES

Crude Oil Futures Continue to Slump 
</P>
<P>
Prices of energy futures were mixed in trading on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange as crude oil futures continued their plunge in a market plagued by 
oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybean prices were mixed, precious metals were 
higher, copper declined and livestock and pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling of the expiring July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the 
benchmark grade of crude oil, weighed on the energy market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude settled 35 cents lower to 14 cents higher, with 
the July contract at $15.30 a barrel; heating oil was 0.03 to 0.21 cent higher, 
with July at 47.64 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in crude prices came in the wake of American Petroleum Institute 
figures showing that U.S. crude inventories last week declined by 1.2 million 
barrels to 384.4 million. Despite the decline, crude stocks remain 44.3 million 
barrels above last year's level, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much pumped crude for the refineries to handle," said James 
Fiedler, an analyst with E. D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
There was some uncertainty in the market because of a shake-up in the Kuwaiti 
government. Longtime oil minister Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah was removed, 
and speculation centered on whether his successor will push more strongly for 
OPEC to cut production and raise oil prices.

BUSH SUSPENDS TALKS WITH PLO; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: PRESIDENT ASSAILS THE ORGANIZATION'S FAILURE TO DENOUNCE A SPLINTER 
GROUP'S RAID ON AN ISRAELI BEACH.

<P>
President Bush on Wednesday suspended the 18-month-old U.S. dialogue with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization in response to the foiled Palestinian 
guerrilla landing on an Israeli beach last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue. To date, the PLO has 
not provided a credible accounting," Bush said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials said that Bush is prepared to resume the talks with the 
PLO once the organization denounces the raid -- which a PLO faction known as 
the Palestine Liberation Front claimed to have carried out -- and disciplines 
the splinter group. 
</P>
<P>
The low-key dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization began in 
December, 1988, when U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. met with a PLO 
representative in Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
The path for that meeting was cleared when Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman, 
acknowledged Is rael's right to exist and renounced the use of terrorism. Until 
he took those steps, U.S. policy forbade official contact with representatives 
of the key organization representing Palestinians in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since the terrorist raid on a beach near Tel Aviv on May 30, Bush has 
been under increasing pressure from Congress, Israel and Israel's supporters to 
suspend the talks. Israeli forces intercepted the guerrillas on land and in the 
speedboats they used to approach the shore. Four guerrillas were killed and 12 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of the force and the geographical target area strongly indicate that 
civilians would have been the target," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Front, claiming responsibility for the 
raid shortly after it occurred, said that it was intended to "avenge" the 
killings of seven Palestinian day laborers in the town of Rishon Le Zion, south 
of Tel Aviv, by an Israeli gunman May 20. 
</P>
<P>
The front is led by Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, a member of the 
PLO Executive Committee. His organization is one of the more radical wings 
under the PLO umbrella and also one of the smallest. In 1985, it planned and 
executed the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro, during which 
an American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure on Bush, Administration officials had clearly sought to 
avoid the rupture out of concern that it would cut off what had been seen as a 
useful -- if not overtly productive -- contact with some of the most important 
players in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau, the U.S. envoy to Tunisia, had met at least six times in "intense 
discussions" with PLO representatives since the raid, and Bush held off 
suspending the talks "to give them time to do what we want: denounce the act 
and discipline the guy who did it," said a White House official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
According to the White House official, the PLO said that it was unable to 
"dictate" to each of its member factions and that it, too, had to pay heed to 
"domestic pressure" from among its constituent groups and Arab supporters. 
</P>
<P>
But when the delay in action failed to produce the desired results, the 
Administration believed that it had no options left and it sent word to the 
Palestinians and Israel early Wednesday morning that it was about to act. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, the leaders of both parties were quick to praise Bush's 
decision to suspend the dialogue with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"The President had no choice but to suspend the dialogue," said California Rep. 
Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), a member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee 
on Europe and the Middle East. "When the United States blinks at terrorism, it 
just encourages those who engage in terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), one of the most anti-PLO legislators on Capitol 
Hill, said he will push for passage of a bill that would prevent the President 
from resuming the dialogue unless both the PLO and all of its constituent 
factions renounce terrorism and publicly recognize Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who in recent months has emerged as 
one of the Senate's sternest critics of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 
government, said: "The ball is in the PLO's court. It must unequivocally 
condemn the recent terrorist attack. It must discipline those responsible, 
starting with Abul Abbas." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his way to East Berlin for German 
reunification talks, said that suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue could be a 
setback for the Arab-Israeli peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the PLO, as a result of its contacts with Washington, had given 
tacit approval to peace talks between Israel and a delegation of Palestinians 
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
He said "it remains to be seen" whether the PLO will withdraw its approval as a 
result of Bush's decision to terminate the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
In private, U.S. officials said they hope the rupture will not last long. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want this to be a protracted suspension. We hope it is a temporary 
move," a State Department official said. "The shorter the better for the Middle 
East peace process and all parties concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a day that included a visit to the George C. 
Marshall Space Flight Center, and two speeches at political fund-raising events 
here and in Charlotte, N.C., Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to suspend the dialogue between the United States and the PLO, 
pending a satisfactory response from the PLO of steps it is taking to resolve 
problems associated with the recent acts of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the PLO, an umbrella group made up of often-warring 
factions, has disassociated itself from the attack and has condemned attacks 
against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
"This alone is not sufficient," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that "we are prepared to promptly resume the dialogue" once the 
Palestinian organization takes "the necessary steps" -- meaning once the PLO 
denounces the raid and disciplines Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes at a particularly bleak period in the effort to revive the 
stalled Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's new Israeli government has taken a hard line against talks with 
Palestinian representatives and has vowed to press ahead with the establishment 
of new settlements in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
But a week after Baker expressed irritation with the delays in the peace 
process -- an irritation that was taken as a slap at Israel -- Bush's move 
serves to restore a measure of public balance. When the action Wednesday is 
linked with Baker's remarks a week ago, the Administration, in effect, has 
demonstrated dissatisfaction with both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Even though specific gains from the talks in Tunis were difficult to enumerate, 
Bush said the mere fact that a dialogue about Middle East politics and security 
was taking place represented progress. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Robin Wright and Michael Ross, in Washington, and Norman 
Kempster, with Baker, contributed to this report.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS PLANS UP TO 10,000 MORE LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp., facing serious technical problems in its military 
aircraft programs and financial difficulties in its commercial jetliner 
business, said Wednesday that it will attempt to cut $700 million from its 
annual operating costs -- a move that could lead to an estimated 10,000 layoffs 
companywide. 
</P>
<P>
Such cutbacks would come on top of the current plan to lay off 7,000 workers at 
the Long Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit, which is losing money and facing a 
cash squeeze. The new round of layoffs covers all divisions of the company. 
While the company did not specify the potential impact in Southern California, 
the new layoffs here are likely to number in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
The company's crash effort to slash costs comes amid growing concern over the 
financial health of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest 
defense contractor and a major competitor in the commercial aircraft industry. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to employees entitled "The Hard Reality," company Chairman John 
McDonnell said that the cost-cutting plan will be implemented by early August 
and that there will be no severance payments or incentives for employees to 
quit. He said the "layoffs are driven by ongoing unsatisfactory business 
results." 
</P>
<P>
The company is the second-largest aerospace employer in Southern California, 
with an estimated 50,000 jobs here out of the company's total work force of 
129,000. McDonnell has plants in Long Beach, Torrance, Huntington Beach and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Michael Burch said the Douglas Aircraft subsidiary would be 
required to absorb additional work force cutbacks. "Certainly, Douglas would 
get some credit for what it has already done to reduce employment, but it is 
clear that Douglas will have to take more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, John McDonnell said the company is not considering a 
restructuring or "the sale of component companies," apparently referring to 
persistent rumors that the company will close Douglas Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to layoffs, the company intends to cut overtime, travel, new 
hiring, the use of consultants and other support activities. However, potential 
savings in these areas are considered to be minor compared to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace analyst Howard Rubel of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell, an 
investment firm, called the cutbacks "another missile from John McDonnell," but 
added that the radical step is necessary to improve the company's lackluster 
financial performance. Rubel said that a successful cost-cutting effort could 
lift McDonnell Douglas' productivity level to that of Boeing Co., when measured 
on the basis of sales per employee. 
</P>
<P>
"They are shucking their paternalistic ways," Rubel said. But the new 
atmosphere is also deeply undercutting morale at the company. One scientist 
said Wednesday, "The morale is about what you would expect -- not too high and 
those who remain here are under that much more stress." 
</P>
<P>
John Capellupo, deputy president at Douglas, issued a memo to workers this 
week, saying, "I will demand that my management test you and your team's 
discipline to the limit of their physical and emotional stamina -- but not 
beyond reason." One C-17 worker complained, "Who does he think he is running, 
the Marine Corps?" 
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell letter did not specify how many workers will be forced out as a 
result of the $700-million cost cutting effort, but the cost savings include 
previously announced layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Information in the 1989 annual report indicates that at least 10,000 additional 
workers would have to be let go to achieve the company's goal. Based upon 
figures in the annual report, employees earned an average of about $38,000 each 
last year. Thus, a 17,000-worker cut will save about $650 million annually and 
another $50 million could be saved from non-wage cuts. The $700 million in 
savings would represent between 4.5% and 5% of the company's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Burch acknowledged that the outlook for McDonnell has turned more negative in 
the past two weeks. On June 8, McDonnell disclosed that it expects to take a 
charge against profits on the Navy A-12 attack jet, under development at its 
McDonnell Aircraft unit in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McDonnell has significant cost overruns on its Navy T-45 trainer 
jet program, which has been transferred from Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach to 
the McDonnell Aircraft operation in St. Louis. The massive C-17 development 
program is at its $4.9-billion ceiling, beyond which the company would have to 
pay all costs. 
</P>
<P>
The MD-80 commercial jetliner program is continuing to suffer from 
manufacturing delays that last year resulted in forfeiture of $20 million in 
penalties to customers. And the new MD-11 jetliner cannot be delivered to 
customers until government certification is granted. The company hopes to 
obtain certification by Oct. 31, but until then it must bear the heavy cost of 
financing the aircraft's production. 
</P>
<P>
The run of bad news at the company has dealt a sharp blow to McDonnell stock, 
which closed Wednesday at $39.50 per share, up 87.5 cents. Wednesday's 
announcement came after the market closed. Within the last year, the stock has 
been as high as $79.625.

THRONGS CHEER MANDELA AS TRIP TO U.S. BEGINS

<P>
Nelson Mandela, whose sacrifices for black liberation in South Africa have made 
him a legend at home and abroad, was cheered Wednesday by hundreds of thousands 
of exuberant New Yorkers, serenaded by choirs and showered with a paper 
blizzard in a historic ride up Broadway's "Canyon of Heroes" as he began his 
first visit to America. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional outpouring of support for the 71-year-old leader and his wife, 
Winnie, began the moment they set foot on a red carpet at Kennedy International 
Airport, where they were embraced by black and white political leaders from 
three states and applauded by a crowd bathed in the black, green and gold 
colors of Mandela's movement, the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"You, the wonderful citizens of New York, have demonstrated in the most visible 
manner that we, the oppressed people of South Africa and the ANC, are admired 
and respected (and) that it is the dying apartheid system that is totally 
isolated," Mandela told a crowd on the steps of City Hall, where he accepted 
the key to the city from Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) are overwhelmed by the extraordinary reception that we have received," 
said Mandela, dressed in a blue suit. He was accompanied by his wife, who was 
wrapped in a traditional red-and-white African dashiki. "No . . . words can 
ever express the deep emotions I feel at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who rode with the Mandelas on the parade route, 
described the hero's welcome as "the single most memorable thing I've ever 
witnessed," and he attributed it to the couple's "strength, their 
indomitability. It is what they demonstrate that you can do when your heart is 
filled with righteous passion." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a colossal shout in one magnificent voice, to say to the world that 
it's time for the chains to be thrown off. Put an end to apartheid in South 
Africa. Put an end to the evil," Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's motorcade from the airport wound through neighborhoods of Brooklyn, 
scene of some of New York's recent racial strife, where throngs lined the 
roadway and pressed forward to touch the black limousine carrying the man 
Dinkins later called a "modern-day Moses" for blacks worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela then climbed into a special vehicle with large bulletproof windows and, 
thickly surrounded by dozens of uniformed and plainclothes security officers, 
moved up the narrow skyscraper canyon of lower Manhattan as it rained tons of 
scraps of paper, including some authentic pre-computer age ticker tape imported 
from Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
As Mandela and his wife waved to the noisy revelers, fists shot into the air 
with the traditional salute of the ANC, the liberation movement that, until a 
ban was lifted in February, had been outlawed by the white authorities in South 
Africa for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Construction workers waved their hats, schoolchildren carried signs reading: 
"Hooray You're Free!" and black as well as white office workers in suits and 
ties applauded from open windows. Some even ventured out onto narrow ledges 
high above the street in New York's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated the crowds at 750,000 and said there were no major incidents. 
A contingent of 12,000 police officers, some using bomb-sniffing dogs, was 
deployed to guarantee Mandela's safety. The $2-million tab, mostly for 
overtime, was being picked up by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a nice, warm feeling of camaraderie here today," said Rabbi Gilbert S. 
Rosenthal, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis, as the 
motorcade passed. "It's a great welcome for a great hero." 
</P>
<P>
Another spectator, Lorenzo Grooms, 19, standing ankle-deep in shredded paper, 
was exultant. "It was incredible -- he looked right in our face," Grooms said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other dignitaries who crowded a platform erected in front of City 
Hall were movie director Spike Lee, Dick Gregory, Harry Belafonte, the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson and former New York Mayor Edward I. Koch. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's 12-day, 8-city visit to the United States, which includes a stop next 
week in Los Angeles, has been heralded by ANC leaders as an opportunity to 
thank Americans for their support and urge them to pressure President Bush and 
Congress to maintain economic sanctions against Pretoria until the last 
vestiges of apartheid are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has meetings scheduled next week with Bush and will address a joint 
session of Congress. Mandela's New York schedule includes an address at the 
United Nations and several fund-raisers, from a $5-a-seat rally at Yankee 
Stadium tonight to a $2,500-a-person dinner Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After delivering three speeches during a whirlwind five hours, Mandela was 
taken to the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion, where he spent the 
night. Organizers of the journey, concerned about Mandela's health, canceled 
several private evening meetings and a dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Wilkins, national coordinator of the U.S. tour, said that, although 
Mandela seemed well throughout the day, it had become clear after the last 
speech at City Hall that "he had reached a limit that shouldn't be pushed." 
</P>
<P>
And Wilkins said he has been urging local organizers in other cities to trim 
Mandela's itinerary so that he will have more rest. "We're probably going to 
have to thin it out as we go," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who turns 72 on July 18, has traveled to dozens of countries since his 
Feb. 11 release from a South African prison, where he had served 27 years of a 
life sentence for founding the ANC's guerrilla campaign against the white 
minority government in Pretoria. He underwent minor bladder surgery last month 
and went on the road a day after his hospital discharge, beginning a six-week 
trip that already has taken him through Europe and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC leader, who suffers from high blood pressure, is traveling with a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
New York City came to a virtual standstill at midday when Mandela arrived, 
about two hours late, aboard a Canadian government jet. Organizers blamed the 
delay on the need to give Mandela more rest. New York television stations 
broadcast continuous coverage of the ANC deputy president's every move, 
preempting most of their daytime afternoon programming, and the city's tabloid 
newspapers offered front-page headlines of welcome, with the Daily News saying: 
"Cry Freedom" and New York Newsday announcing: "It's Red Carpet Time." 
</P>
<P>
After being described in glowing terms by Dinkins and Cuomo, Mandela returned 
the compliments, telling Dinkins that his election as the first black mayor of 
New York "filled me and our people with pride. We fully support your struggle 
to heal the wounds of this city." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had read about "the powerful oratory and sharp analytical mind" 
of Cuomo, "and I must say now, having heard you speak, that what we heard is no 
exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's 54-year-old wife, herself subjected to years of harassment, detention 
and banishment by South Africa's authorities, addressed the crowd at City Hall 
in one of her rare public speeches since her husband's release. 
</P>
<P>
"You have helped us go through the most difficult years in our struggle for 
freedom," she said. And she thanked Americans "for the solidarity you gave us 
when we were in jail, when I was in (internal) exile and when I was in the 
bigger prison called South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Mandelas stopped in the heart of Brooklyn's predominantly black 
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood at a high school where an estimated 10,000 
students and residents had turned out to see them -- and where their thoughts 
were on the racial divisions in their own city. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at all my people!" said Gloria Mingo Jackson, a Brooklyn schoolteacher. 
"We're together. We're not fighting. We're going to get it together as a 
people. This is something I'm going to tell my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Mandela's fans said they especially admired him for his principled 
stand in prison, where he had refused government offers of freedom in exchange 
for a renunciation of the ANC's strategy of armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"He has given up his whole life" for black liberation, said Erna Letemps, 21, 
who had come from Orange, N.J., to see Mandela at the school. "He knew what the 
struggle was and he stuck to it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd outside City Hall in Manhattan, 76-year-old James C. Campbell, 
a sergeant in an all-black regiment during World War II, said he respected 
Mandela for holding his ground over a principle. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Gadsden, a telephone operator, brought her four grandchildren "to see 
a hero." She said: "He's an important figure for us. I don't care what color 
you are, we have to work together for equality. That's what this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela alternately urged continued sanctions against his country's government 
and financial help for his organization, which is beginning the massive task of 
re-establishing itself as a political entity inside South Africa. Although one 
of many political organizations representing the voteless black majority in 
South Africa, the ANC in the opinion of most analysts has the greatest support 
among the 27 million blacks. The ANC supports one-person, one-vote rule on a 
universal voters roll, and it has been slowly gaining support among the 5 
million whites there. 
</P>
<P>
"We can see the light at the end of the tunnel," Mandela said Wednesday. "We 
are therefore appealing to you in all humility and in all sincerity that you 
must join us" by maintaining American sanctions against South Africa and 
donating money to the ANC cause. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC believes sanctions against Pretoria have forced President Frederik W. 
de Klerk to initiate a series of rapid reforms in the past four months. De 
Klerk's actions have freed up black political activity and lifted many of the 
most onerous security measures used by the authorities to put down 
anti-government protest. This week he also pushed through Parliament 
legislation that eliminates one of the pillars of apartheid, the Separate 
Amenities Act, which allows city councils in South Africa to segregate public 
facilities such as libraries, recreation halls, parks and swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
However, other important apartheid laws, including those that mandate 
segregated residential areas and schools, remain. 
</P>
<P>
Zwelakhe Sisulu, one of Mandela's aides, predicted that "a lot of black South 
Africans are really going to feel good about what happened today, with black 
and white people praising Mr. Mandela. And it's going to get a lot of white 
people in South Africa thinking seriously about the future of their country."

INS CHIEF PROPOSES SWEEPING CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: THE OVERHAUL COULD MEAN MORE AGENTS ALONG THE MEXICAN BORDER AND 
IMPROVED SERVICES FOR INCOMING FOREIGNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new chief of the Immigration and Naturalization Service has proposed 
sweeping changes to the agency that could result in more enforcement agents 
along the U.S.-Mexican border, more consistent sanctions against violators of 
immigration laws and better services for immigrants and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The planned overhaul -- which Commissioner Gene McNary reportedly wants in 
place by the end of the year -- would be the most comprehensive restructuring 
of the INS since it was decentralized in 1955, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents hope that the changes will help reduce lengthy delays for foreign 
nationals and relatives seeking citizenship, political asylum and permission to 
work in the United States. Backlogs for a wide range of immigration benefits 
have long been particularly pronounced in Southern California, which 
increasingly is the preferred destination for immigrants, both legal and 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a potential here for alleviating some of the real, profound 
problems that have long existed in (the region)," said Warren Leiden, executive 
director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials stress that the plans are preliminary and will require the 
approval of the U.S. Justice Department and the federal Office of Management 
and Budget, along with a Congressional review. McNary will also have to 
overcome some tough opposition from officials within the agency, including 
Western Regional Commissioner Ben Davidian, who are leery of his desire to 
centralize power. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian contends that a reorganization now could hurt the progress of the INS 
amnesty program, under which 3 million foreigners, half of them now in 
California, are attempting to become permanent legal U.S. residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although McNary and other top immigration officials declined to comment on the 
reforms, The Times obtained copies of several internal memorandums, letters and 
other documents outlining the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, McNary has expressed concern that the central INS office in 
Washington has lost its agenda-setting role in recent years as several regional 
political appointees -- notable Harold Ezell, the provocative former Western 
regional commissioner -- carved out highly visible mini-empires. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, a former Missouri county executive with a reputation as a deft manager, 
is scheduled to make his first official public appearance in Los Angeles today. 
He took office last fall with a congressional mandate to return stability to a 
labyrinthine agency that several much-publicized studies found to be 
inefficient, inconsistent and riddled with fiscal irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
The service's shortcomings have become more pronounced -- and more public -- in 
recent years as illegal immigration has blossomed into a national concern and 
the service has expanded rapidly from a Justice Department backwater into a 
$1-billion-a-year bureaucracy with more than 15,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The INS, which had its origins as a small bureau of the Treasury Department 
almost a century ago, has a dual role: Its agents arrest almost 1 million or 
more undocumented foreigners each year while, at the same time, officers 
annually admit millions of new immigrants, naturalized citizens and foreign 
visitors into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistent policies from region to region have long plagued the service. For 
example. a survey by the Urban Institute and the RAND Corp., two public policy 
research groups, found that the average fines assessed by the INS against 
employers of illegal aliens varied wildly, from less than $1,000 in San Antonio 
to about $4,500 in Los Angeles to more than $11,000 in New York and $45,000 in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In McNary's plan, the four regional INS offices -- in Laguna Niguel, Dallas, 
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., and Burlington, Vt. -- will become mostly 
administrative bodies, losing most of their enforcement power, including the 
initiation of investigations, the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring 
of smuggling activities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised setup, the service's 34 districts and 21 Border Patrol 
sectors nationwide will report directly to Washington, bypassing the regional 
commissioners. In Washington, a chief of staff and executive commissioner will 
help implement McNary's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The anticipated redesign, McNary explained, will ultimately result in a 
bureaucratic structure such as those of other U.S. Department of Justice 
entities, notably the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said he does not anticipate cutbacks in personnel; in fact, expansions 
are likely, particularly in "seriously understaffed" areas. However, he added 
that transfers, relocations and shifts in duty are also being considered. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most provocative aspects of McNary's blueprint are his intentions to 
narrow and focus the role of the Border Patrol, the service's 4,000-employee 
armed enforcement branch. Agents are principally charged with arresting illegal 
immigrants along the nation's frontiers, particularly the porous, 
almost-2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, seeking to concentrate officers in their primary mission along the 
border zone from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., would largely strip the patrol 
of its roles in anti-smuggling investigations and enforcing laws barring the 
hiring of undocumented workers. Separate INS branches would handle such tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The new commissioner is also proposing reducing staff or shutting down some 
inland Border Patrol posts -- notably those in Livermore, Dallas and Portland 
-- and the redeployment along the border of officers now assigned to inland 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Western Regional Commissioner Davidian, who is based in Laguna Niguel and 
oversees California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam, has argued that regional 
offices are better equipped to understand local issues than a far-removed 
central office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
McNary already has wrested control of budget, personnel and purchasing. In 
addition, policy statements to the press must be cleared through Washington, a 
cumbersome procedure that has been criticized as a "gag order" but one the 
commissioner says ensures that the agency speaks "with one voice."

The international AIDS conference opened here Wednesday as activists stormed 
police barricades outside the Moscone Convention Center and researchers inside 
pleaded for respect for the scientific method and a recognition of a common 
purpose unifying scientists and patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Ziegler, a UC San Francisco professor of medicine and conference 
chairman, called for patience and cooperation among activists and researchers. 
While crediting AIDS activists with impressing upon scientists the urgency of 
the epidemic, he beseeched them not to disrupt the scientific dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask, 'Where are the treatments? Where is the vaccine? The scientific 
method seems frustratingly arcane and the progress painstakingly slow,' " he 
said. But, he added, "in our haste for answers and solutions, however, we 
cannot compromise the scientific method. There are no shortcuts to new 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
"To the scientists and clinicians, I ask: Listen to our patients," Ziegler 
said. ". . . To the persons with HIV infection and their advocates, I say 
welcome. We hear your message. . . . But please respect the scientific process 
and do not obstruct the flow of information. The scientists and activists share 
a unity of interest. Our common enemy is HIV." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the demonstrators, demanding free access to the conference as well as 
access to new drugs to fight the disease, surged forward into a wall of about 
80 helmeted and mounted police. At least 75 protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
As of early Wednesday, about 9,500 delegates and 1,500 journalists from 121 
countries had registered for the four-day conference. The on-site registration 
fee is as high as $550. One hundred agencies and community organizations are 
boycotting the meeting to protest U.S. restriction on travel by foreigners 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour opening ceremony, organizers and speakers wore red armbands 
protesting the federal immigration policy. Activists complained bitterly that 
President Bush had turned down an invitation to speak, instead attending a 
fund-raiser for North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, author of the immigration 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos hailed the estimated 10,000 researchers, health 
care workers, officials, patients and activists gathered in the cavernous 
meeting hall. Comparing the federal response to AIDS to the response to the 
October, 1989, San Francisco earthquake, Agnos asked, "Where is our retrofit 
for AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
More San Franciscans have died of AIDS than died in World War I, World War II, 
and the Korean and Vietnam wars "combined and tripled," Agnos said. "There is 
something wrong when our nation's leaders would rather debate how to protect 
the fabric of the flag than how to protect the fabric of people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jay Levy, a UC San Francisco School of Medicine professor, reviewed in his 
talk what researchers have learned of the human immunodeficiency virus -- how 
it infects not one type of cell but many, how there are many strains, and how 
it can grow more virulent once a person is infected. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been encouraging discoveries, as well. Recent studies suggest a 
quarter of all infected people remain healthy after 10 years, Levy said. And a 
study of infected chimpanzees has found that one animal "appears to have rid 
its body of the virus completely." 
</P>
<P>
"Can we help this happen in humans as well?" Levy asked. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, about 500 activists chanted slogans and taunted the police. Shortly 
before the opening ceremony began, they began rattling barricades despite 
police warnings that they would be clubbed. Then groups of men and women, led 
by the Los Angeles chapter of the activist group ACT UP, began leaping the 
metal barricades and rushing police lines. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were cited for interfering with a police officer. The arrests 
continued for about an hour as new activists filled the gaps left by those 
loaded into sheriff's buses. "I have HIV infection and I want action," Patrick 
Leach of San Francisco said as he was being taken away.

During the two-hour opening ceremony late Wednesday, organizers and speakers 
wore red armbands protesting the federal immigration policy. Activists 
complained bitterly that President Bush had turned down an invitation to speak, 
instead attending a fund-raiser for North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, the author 
of the immigration restrictions.

loaded into jail buses. "I have HIV infection and I want action," said Patrick 
Leach of San Francisco, as he was being taken away. There were no reported 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Peter Staley, a member of the activist group ACT UP/New York invited to 
speak in the ceremony, criticized what he described as federal researchers' 
failure to explore AIDS drugs other than AZT. Staley also cited the documented 
underrepresentation of women and minorities in federally funded experimental 
drug trials. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we all, before it's too late, begin to understand each other?" Staley 
asked. "Will we realize that we share similar motivations? Can we try, at least 
this week, to bridge the widening gap between us? 
</P>
<P>
"While at times we may offend you, remember as well that like you, ACT UP has 
succeeded in prolonging the lives of thousands of people living with HIV 
disease," Staley told the researchers, physicians and health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
Staley rallied the delegates to protest the federal immigration policy, leading 
a chant, "Change the law." The hall responded, but less vociferously when 
Staley segued into another chant, "Three hundred thousand dead from AIDS. Where 
is George?" 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, too, criticized the federal response to the 
epidemic. Comparing the federal response to AIDS to the response to the Oct. 
17, 1989, San Francisco earthquake, Agnos asked, "Where is our retrofit for

the fabric of the flag than how to protect the fabric of people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Also speaking was Dr. June Osborn, chairwoman of the National Commission on 
AIDS. Osborn argued that the AIDS epidemic has simply exacerbated 
long-simmering problems and inequities in the health-care system, the economy 
and society at large. 
</P>
<P>
"The only new thing we face is the virus," said Osborn.

EXPERTS CHALLENGE VIEW THAT SPREAD OF AIDS HAS PEAKED

Top federal science advisers Wednesday challenged recent suggestions that the 
AIDS epidemic has peaked in the United States, citing new evidence that rising 
infection rates among women, teen-agers and middle Americans are more than 
making up for any slowing among urban gay men. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, in a report released here by the National Research Council, 
said crack cocaine is carrying the AIDS virus to previously uninfected groups, 
particularly women, and that studies of military recruits and urban teen-age 
mothers reveal that the virus is now well "seeded" among adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
The committee called for a doubling of federal spending for AIDS prevention and 
for new and "user-friendly" forms of protection besides the condom. They also 
urged new ways of screening blood donors to reduce the up to 400 new infections 
still caused annually by contaminated blood. 
</P>
<P>
"We could find little credible evidence that the end of the AIDS epidemic is in 
sight," Don C. Des Jarlais, the committee vice chairman, said in a press 
conference preceding the Sixth International Conference on AIDS . He added: 
"The prevalence of the disease has . . . increased in new subpopulations not 
previously identified as high-risk groups." 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee is made up of social, behavioral and statistical 
scientists brought together by the National Research Council. The council is 
the operating arm of the 127-year-old National Academy of Sciences, which 
explores questions of science and technology for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence cited by the committee included the following: 
</P>
<P>
Tests of military recruits show that AIDS virus infections among 17- and 
18-year-old men and women are equal -- a finding that committee members said 
suggests that in the future women will carry a heavier burden of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests in newborn infants show that nearly one in every 100 black and 
Latino teen-age mothers in New York City are infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco and two other unnamed West Coast cities have found that younger 
gay men, aged 18 to 25, are two to three times as likely as older gay men to 
risk becoming infected through unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
Des Jarlais, speaking to reporters, called on government agencies and community 
groups "to heed the data available about sexual activity and drug use reported 
by young people themselves and not engage in wishful thinking about patterns of 
behavior some might hope teen-agers would follow." 
</P>
<P>
The committee called for explicit AIDS education efforts in the schools that go 
beyond explanations of how the virus is spread and include specific information 
on such things as precisely how to use condoms and how to "negotiate" safer sex 
with a sexual partner. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also urged more meticulous screening of people who give blood. 
At the same time, to ensure adequate blood supplies, the committee called for 
recruiting of non-traditional donors, such as people over 65 who are often 
automatically excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the scientists criticized policies that have hampered the search for 
accurate information about how and where the epidemic is spreading in the 
United States -- data considered essential to allocating resources to fight the 
disease, and to designing programs to prevent further spread. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the committee condemned a congressional policy barring the use of 
federal money to assess the value of clean-needle programs to prevent infection 
among intravenous drug users and the absence of any detailed survey of sexual 
practices in the United States.

An international conference to stave off further erosion of the Earth's 
protective ozone layer opened here Wednesday amid widespread optimism that an 
agreement is near to significantly strengthen controls on ozone-destroying 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from more than 55 nations and from major chemical manufacturers and 
environmental groups closeted themselves to hammer out details of far-reaching 
amendments to the Montreal Protocol, which will expand the list of chemicals 
controlled by the accord and establish a fund to assist Third World nations in 
paying for more expensive ozone-friendly substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, expected to continue at least through Saturday, are aimed at 
presenting a final document to environmental ministers for their endorsement 
when they arrive next week. Their endorsement would precede formal approval by 
their governments. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to fail in London. The stakes are very high," Mostafa K. 
Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told 
participants shortly before the conference was closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the threat is global, Tolba added: "It is a must that north and 
south, east and west should cooperate together. It is not an option." 
</P>
<P>
The stratospheric ozone layer shields all life on the planet from the sun's 
ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppression of 
the body's immune system and damage to plant and animal life. 
</P>
<P>
Only a week ago, there was considerably less optimism that an agreement on 
strengthening the protocol could be achieved. Last month, at a preliminary 
U.N.-sponsored meeting in Geneva, the United States served notice that it would 
oppose any effort to require industrialized countries to provide additional aid 
to Third World nations to help them pay the higher costs of using less harmful 
chemicals. It argued that the World Bank has sufficient funds to meet the 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position stirred an international outcry, not only among Third World 
countries sometimes referred to as "the South" but even from Americas' closest 
allies. They urged President Bush to reverse the position, which was fashioned 
by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Richard Darman, director of 
the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week after intensive lobbying, Sununu told reporters that the United 
States will now support additional funds and offered a proposal for dispensing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S. plan is not totally acceptable to developing countries, who 
want a greater voice in spending the estimated $240 million needed in the first 
three years of the program. Nor is there agreement on how developed countries 
such as the United States are to be assessed their share of the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was general agreement here Wednesday that the biggest obstacle has 
been overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"That has removed what many people regarded as a major obstacle to this 
meeting, and we are grateful for the shift," British Environmental Secretary 
Chris Patten said of the U.S. shift. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
was one among those who urged Bush to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
Another encouraging sign came Wednesday when delegates from China presented an 
estimate of their cost for complying with the protocol which closely matched 
Tolba's -- about $40 million in the first three years. 
</P>
<P>
Neither China nor India, which together account for 40% of the world's 
population, has signed the protocol. At a similar ozone conference here last 
year, they warned that unless developed countries, which they blame for most 
ozone depletion, foot much of their costs, they will not sign. 
</P>
<P>
Several major amendments to the protocol are under consideration. They include 
a total phase-out of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 
2000 instead of the 50% reduction called for in the original protocol signed 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The original accord also limited the consumption of halons -- used as fire 
extinguishing agents -- only to 1986 levels, starting in 1992. The proposal now 
before delegates calls for a 50% reduction by 1995 and a ban by the year 2000. 
The United States and the European Community have endorsed the earlier 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, two chemical solvents that contribute to ozone depletion but 
are not now covered by the protocol are expected to be added: carbon 
tetrachloride and methyl chloroform. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the conference opened, delegates were given disturbing additional 
evidence of destruction of the ozone layer. A report released by British 
government said recent evidence has reinforced a 1988 report of "substantial 
damage" to the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the ozone hole over the Antarctic was "depleted as severely" in 
1989 as it was in 1987. The report said that the less severe depletion in 1988 
"was not a sign of recovery" but merely evidence that variability from year to 
year should be expected.

GOVERNMENT CRITIC GETS DEATH THREATS IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sign that Mexico's propaganda war may be turning violent, a prominent 
critic of the government has received two death threats in less than a week, 
according to police reports. The first threat was made by a man tentatively 
identified as a Mexico City police investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The threats against Jorge G. Castaneda, a professor of political science at the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico, have caused an uproar in Mexican 
political and intellectual circles. Over the weekend, President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari telephoned Castaneda from Japan, where he was on a state visit, and 
sent a statement "energetically" denouncing the first incident. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda's secretary, Mariana Rodriguez Villegas, was stopped by two men as 
she left his office Friday afternoon, according to a complaint filed with the 
police. After verifying that she works for Castaneda, the men gave her a 
message: "This is the first call. If he continues, he will be" and they used a 
threatening obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, after reviewing police photo files, which include police officers, 
she identified one of the men as a plainclothes police investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours later, another stranger threatened her and Castaneda as she 
sat in her car. 
</P>
<P>
While federal and municipal officials expressed their repugnance at the 
threats, the government-owned El Nacional newspaper accused Castaneda of being 
obsessed with the idea that he is a victim of government persecution. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda, whose commentaries criticizing the government are frequently 
published in the Mexican and U.S. press, including the commentary pages of the 
Los Angeles Times, was one of three intellectuals harshly attacked this spring 
by a pro-government columnist in El Universal newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials have denied any involvement in the mudslinging and, from 
Salinas down, have expressed outrage at the threats to his life. 
</P>
<P>
However, Castaneda said, the written attacks as well as the physical threats 
are linked to the government's attitude toward its critics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Salinas administration has made a point of identifying people it considers 
academic-intellectual enemies in a way that is unprecedented," he charged. 
"That is virtually an invitation to the crazies underneath. It's a dangerous 
game to play." 
</P>
<P>
Lower-level police officials easily make the transition from identifying 
enemies to eliminating them, Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the same thugs that killed (DEA agent Enrique) Camarena," he said, 
characterizing the mentality of Mexican law enforcement and referring to a 1985 
slaying in which Mexican law enforcement officials allegedly were involved. 
</P>
<P>
A forthcoming report by Human Rights Watch warns that the Mexican police are 
out of control because of the wide latitude given them to fight the war on 
drugs. The report is part of a mounting wave of international criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Salinas announced the creation of a National Human Rights 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Congress, Deputy Ruben Venadero Valenzuela, a spokesman for a 
group of opposition political parties, said the threats against Castaneda are 
indicative of a lack of respect for civil rights, including free speech.

ZIONIST BODY YIELDS TO SHAMIR ON SOVIET JEWS

<P>
A worldwide conference of Jews, whose backing is crucial for Israel, dropped a 
resolution Wednesday opposing settlement of Soviet Jews on occupied Arab land 
after bitter debate and a warning from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir told the World Zionist Organization that warnings of war over the Soviet 
Jews are an Arab ruse to sabotage their immigration to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before Shamir, a champion of Jewish settlement in the occupied 
territories, addressed the group's general council, its members argued heatedly 
over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 150 delegates yelled insults at each other over the draft 
resolution, which in effect called for Soviet Jews to stay away from the 
occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
One of the delegates who proposed the settlement resolution, Hillel Shuval, 
told Reuters news agency it had been intended as a warning to Israel that the 
Jewish state might not receive the full backing of world Jewry if it continues 
with "irresponsible" policies. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Likud delegate Matitahu Drobles shouted at Shuval on the council 
floor: "Where are you going? Aren't you ashamed? . . . Are we going to repeat 
the lie over and over that there are places where Jews can't settle?" 
</P>
<P>
A final vote was postponed until after Shamir's speech, when the council 
chairman announced the resolution had been withdrawn. Sources in the delegation 
that proposed the resolution said they had withdrawn it to avoid further 
divisive argument. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip staged a 
general strike marking the massacre last month of seven Arab laborers by a lone 
Israeli gunman outside Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was sparse, and virtually all shops were closed in response to the 
strike, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
World Zionist Organization members, traditional supporters of Israel, are being 
asked to foot much of the bill for settling up to 1 million Soviet Jews in the 
next five years. The organization has an global membership of 1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir described the issue of settlement in the occupied territories, scene of 
a 31-month-old Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule, as a smoke screen. He 
said recent threats against Israel by Iraq and Syria have created a dangerous 
atmosphere.

ILIESCU INAUGURATED; U.S. BOYCOTTS CEREMONY

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Communist Ion Iliescu pledged Wednesday to be a democratic president of 
reconciliation, but the United States boycotted his inauguration to protest his 
role in violent attacks on opposition figures. 
</P>
<P>
The capital was generally quiet after a tumultuous week of anti-government 
riots, mob rule by loyalist miners and a crackdown on dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the happiest day of my life," Iliescu told reporters, before swearing 
"faithfulness to the Romanian people and to their ideals of freedom and 
prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
He pledged "to defend democracy (and) . . . fundamental human rights and 
freedoms." 
</P>
<P>
"I shall firmly militate for the safeguarding of civic liberties . . . on our 
way to a genuinely free and democratic society," Iliescu said, pledging to be a 
"president . . . of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Iliescu supporters cheered him when he emerged from the downtown Atheneum 
music hall after his inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu's inauguration came one week to the day after riot police brutally 
dispersed a 53-day rally of his opponents demanding that he and other former 
Communists be banned from politics for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rioters subsequently assaulted and firebombed government buildings, and 
thousands of club-wielding miners from Transylvania descended on the capital in 
response to an appeal by Iliescu, attacking opposition politicians and anyone 
deemed a government critic. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous countries and international human rights groups condemned the violence 
and its links to the National Salvation Front-dominated government. Some 
governments have suspended non-humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
Petre Roman, who was formally appointed prime minister by Iliescu after serving 
as interim premier since December, tried to ease foreign concerns. 
</P>
<P>
He told state radio: "We want to prove to the international community that our 
way to a true democracy is irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said human rights 
violations in Romania are continuing. He said Romania has arrested 45 
opposition figures in the last two days and that the Administration believes 
the purpose is to intimidate Romanians from exercising their rights. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from Canada and members of the 12-nation European Community 
attended the inaugural ceremony but echoed U.S. criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting at length on last week's violence, Iliescu publicly distanced 
himself for the first time from the miners' vigilante tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"There was overreaction in the public order restoration process," he said. 
"Institutions, (opposition) party headquarters and homes were broken into, and 
citizens unconnected with the earlier (violence) . . . were roughed up. We 
unequivocally dissociate ourselves from all actions that transcended the legal 
framework."

BUSH WANTS TO REWARD DE KLERK REFORMS

President Bush said Wednesday that while U.S. law does not permit him to lift 
economic sanctions imposed on South Africa by the United States, he would like 
to find some way to encourage South African President Frederik W. de Klerk's 
"new approach" in that racially divided nation. 
</P>
<P>
On the day that Nelson Mandela, the South African black leader, arrived in New 
York, Bush also said he would not apologize for the alleged involvement by the 
Central Intelligence Agency in the process that led to Mandela's arrest in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was freed from South African prisons last February, after 27 years in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Without confirming the allegation about the CIA, carried in news reports last 
weekend, Bush said, "I will take my leadership on that question from Mr. 
Mandela, who put it very well when he said let bygones by bygones." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who headed the CIA in 1976-77, spoke at a news conference after touring 
the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who is scheduled to welcome Mandela to the White House on 
Monday, praised De Klerk, whose decision led to Mandela's freedom and the 
lifting of a state of emergency in most of the troubled nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who originally opposed the sanctions, which limit U.S.-South African 
economic activity, said, "if you can credit sanctions with the evolution 
towards democracy in South Africa, I'd have to say, well, it seems to be -- 
there are some good things to it." 
</P>
<P>
"It's delicate because I want to find a way to show our appreciation to De 
Klerk and yet I don't want to pull the rug out from under Mr. Mandela," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
"I salute Mr. De Klerk for what he's done. He's come a long, long way. And I 
salute Mr. Mandela for his approach to De Klerk. I think that demonstrates a 
willingness to talk that few of us might have predicted a couple years ago," 
Bush said, referring to the halting dialogue in which the two men -- one 
representing the white minority, the other the black majority -- have engaged. 
</P>
<P>
He credited De Klerk with a "new approach that is having South Africa evolve to 
a much more open society and, hopefully, one day, to one which is colorblind in 
terms of participation in the political process." 
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's apartheid laws, people are officially classified by race, 
public schools are segregated, most land is reserved for whites, and blacks 
lack a voice in national affairs.

A lawyer for the Panamanian government told a federal judge Wednesday that 
Panama soon will file a $5.3-billion racketeering lawsuit against Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that the civil suit will accuse the deposed dictator of being 
responsible for the murders of three of his opponents, including a priest and a 
leader of an ill-fated coup last October. He said Panama will also accuse 
Noriega of extortion, fraud and theft schemes that deprived the country of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise announcement was made after federal prosecutors met with Noriega's 
lawyers and agreed to try to unfreeze $4.5 million to $6 million being held in 
the general's accounts in European banks. The money is to be placed in an 
escrow account and dispensed by a federal judge to pay for Noriega's defense. 
</P>
<P>
The former Panamanian leader has pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking and 
money-laundering charges in U.S. District Court here. His trial is expected to 
begin early next year. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the U.S. government, banks in several European countries 
froze accounts holding an estimated $20 million linked to Noriega. U.S. 
authorities said the money was tainted because it was earned through 
drug-dealing and money-laundering activities. 
</P>
<P>
The accounts were frozen after Noriega surrendered to U.S. authorities 
following last December's invasion of Panama. Noriega's four defense attorneys 
have said that they have spent $1 million already. They threatened to withdraw 
from the case unless they were paid. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to unfreeze the bank accounts was worked out after Judge William 
M. Hoeveler rejected a prosecution proposal that the United States pay for 
Noriega's defense and then be reimbursed from the frozen funds after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Sullivan said in court that the deal had been 
approved "at the highest levels of the Justice Department." He said it requires 
the U.S. government to ask the foreign banks to release the money but does not 
guarantee that they will do so. 
</P>
<P>
After Hoeveler approved the agreement, attorney Gregory Craig told the judge 
that he represented the Panamanian government and that it objected to the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"Any assets that lawfully belong to the people of Panama should not be used to 
fund Noriega's defense," Craig said. His Washington law firm, Williams &amp; 
Connolly, recently represented Oliver L. North, the former White House national 
security adviser who once used Noriega to help mount operations against the 
Sandinista government in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Craig told the court that Panama intends to file a lawsuit accusing Noriega of 
racketeering through a series of illegal schemes and acts. He said that the 
lawsuit will seek $300 million in compensatory damages and $5 billion in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Craig told reporters that Panama's suit will accuse 
Noriega of being responsible for the deaths of a Colombian priest, a political 
opponent and a leader of the unsuccessful October, 1989, coup. He said that the 
lawsuit will be filed in a U.S. court within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The priest, Father Hector Gallegos, was thrown out of a helicopter over the 
ocean in 1972. He had been organizing opposition to the regime of Gen. Omar 
Torrijos, Noriega's predecessor and mentor. 
</P>
<P>
The second slaying was that of Hugo Spadafora, a one-time Noriega ally who had 
become his most vocal political opponent. He was killed in 1985 near the 
Panama-Costa Rica border and his body was found in a U.S. mail bag on the Costa 
Rican side. His head was never found and the case was never investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the suit also will accuse Noriega of ordering the execution of Capt. 
Moises Giroldi, who was in charge of security troops at Noriega's headquarters 
until he led the failed coup last year and was later shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said he would deal with the Panama's objections to the use of 
Noriega's money after the lawsuit is filed.

HOUSE OVERRIDES BUSH'S VETO OF HATCH ACT BILL

The House on Wednesday, by a vote of 327 to 93, overrode President Bush's veto 
of legislation to give millions of government workers the right to play a more 
active role in politics. 
</P>
<P>
The House vote, well over the necessary two-thirds majority, sets up a showdown 
today in the Senate, where a much closer outcome is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would remove many of the prohibitions in the 1939 Hatch Act, which now 
bars 3 million federal civil service and postal workers from actively 
participating in political parties or candidates' campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the House's 176 Republicans, including Minority Leader Robert 
H. Michel of Illinois, bolted from the Administration to support the veto 
override. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the bill by a potentially veto-overriding 67-30 vote in 
May. The Administration's task after the House vote, in order to sustain Bush's 
winning record in veto showdowns, was to get two of the 13 Senate Republicans 
who supported changing the law to switch. 
</P>
<P>
Bush vetoed the bill last Friday, saying it "would inevitably lead to 
re-politicizing the federal work force" and would "destroy its essential 
political neutrality."

A man who caught a 300-pound Atlantic sturgeon could be sentenced to a year in 
prison and fined $1,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Mann was charged Monday with fishing without a commercial license and 
illegally setting a net. Wildlife officials were also upset because the 
sturgeon was female and the roe was lost. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, 24, of South Berwick, caught the fish in the Salmon Fall River. He 
described it as the "catch of the day, the year, the century." 
</P>
<P>
But his bragging caught the ears of local officials. They arrested him and 
called in the Maine Marine Patrol, which seized the fish.

LEGISLATORS ROLL OUT PORK BARREL DESPITE BUDGET PINCH 
</P>

<P>
Even though the state is having trouble paying its bills, it was business as 
usual Wednesday when a two-house budget negotiating committee waded into the 
budget problem by listening to a parade of lawmakers plead for millions in pork 
barrel projects. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 Republican and Democratic lawmakers lined up to plead with the six 
members of the budget conference committee for extra money for school buses, 
child-care programs, new parks, museums, a wading pool, senior centers and an 
assortment of other projects in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Just where the money would come from to pay for the projects is not clear, 
although hours before the committee began its deliberations, Gov. George 
Deukmejian and legislative leaders released reconciled budget figures showing 
that the revenue gap is now in the range of $2.9 billion, rather than $3.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Budget officials said the lower figure represents a hard number that includes 
some of the budget cuts requested in January by Deukmejian. Among those are 
savings in methods of purchasing drugs for state programs and delaying payment 
of Medi-Cal bills next year as well as this year. Several weeks ago, state 
officials revealed that the Medi-Cal program had run out of money and could not 
make scheduled payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
But even the $2.9-billion figure represents a huge gap, since neither 
Republicans nor Democrats are giving much ground -- at least publicly. 
Democrats went into the final round of budget negotiations Wednesday still 
insisting on tax increases to help close the gap while Republicans were holding 
fast that the problem could be solved with reduced spending. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) emerged from a private meeting with Deukmejian 
and Republican leaders Wednesday morning talking about a one-year freeze on 
inflation adjustments in income tax rates that would require Californians to 
pay an additional $1 billion in 1990. As it is now, tax rates are adjusted for 
inflation, in a procedure known as indexing, so that cost-of-living pay raises 
do not result in higher tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
During the conference committee session, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters of Los 
Angeles, one of the Democratic negotiators, used the pork barrel requests as 
leverage to build support for a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the shortfall, Waters asked Republican lawmakers if they would 
support a tax increase to help finance the proposed $56-billion budget the 
committee is working on. 
</P>
<P>
"I am dealing with the budget with an open mind," replied Assemblyman William 
J. Filante (R-Greenbrae), giving a typical answer. 
</P>
<P>
One of Filante's requests was for $50,000 to help finance a museum to show 
"preserved animals" at Petaluma High School. 
</P>
<P>
One Republican lawmaker, Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) outlined 
a list of $2.2 billion in cuts in a letter to other GOP legislators. He started 
off by proposing to save $1.6 million by eliminating free cars provided to 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that lawmaker paychecks are expected to increase because of voter 
approval in the June 5 primary election of Proposition 112, which will set up a 
special commission to study legislators' salaries, McClintock said: "Surely 
they can pay for their own cars."

INFORMAL, PRIVATE MEETINGS HELD BY LEGISLATORS DRAW COMPLAINTS 
</P>

<P>
Public interest advocates complained Wednesday that, despite a voter-approved 
ban on closed meetings by public officials, legislative leaders continue to 
meet informally in secret to discuss -- and influence -- the fate of bills. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings technically do not violate long-standing laws regulating lawmaker 
gatherings, but opponents charge that they violate the spirit of Proposition 
112. That measure, approved June 5, included a provision to strengthen laws 
prohibiting legislative committees from meeting in private. 
</P>
<P>
But just one day after Proposition 112 passed, an informal "screening panel" of 
powerful senators convened privately to consider 57 bills, among them one by 
Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) that would have extended open-meeting 
guarantees to such advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has a long-standing tradition of senior lawmakers meeting in 
private to set priorities for big-ticket spending bills. Lawmakers argue that 
those gatherings do not violate the open-meeting laws because the legislators 
do not constitute a quorum of any committee. 
</P>
<P>
At the June 6 meeting, five senators, including Senate President Pro Tem David 
A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Presley 
(D-Riverside), considered bills worth $2 billion, Presley said in a telephone 
interview. He said that they recommended the Appropriations Committee place a 
number of bills in its "suspense file" -- meaning little hope of passage -- 
including Kopp's legislation, with an estimated fiscal impact of about 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I was flabbergasted," Kopp said Wednesday. "That bill should not have gone 
into 'suspense.' It was below $150,000, and under committee policy those bills 
are automatically passed out." 
</P>
<P>
Open-meeting advocates immediately blasted the senators' move. "That should no 
longer be permitted," said Ruth Holton, a lobbyist for California Common Cause. 
"We believe it's a serious problem whenever important decisions are made in 
private and the public has no way of knowing why one bill was chosen over 
another. That decision ought to be taken in regular budget hearings." 
</P>
<P>
Presley said the screening group rejected Kopp's bill because "it didn't seem 
to be a big priority. We had just passed (Proposition) 112, which enlarges the 
scope of the open-meetings law and that seemed to be sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Presley also defended the existence of the screening group. Because the 
Appropriations Committee has to consider hundreds of spending bills, senators 
need a method of setting priorities, he said. "It's the only way we can think 
of to deal with the problem of all these bills. You have to do the screening to 
cut the bills down to a manageable number." 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Dorais of the California Newspaper Publishers Assn. said: "I think 
it violates the spirit of Proposition 112. The spirit of 112 is that the 
decision-making process ought to be an open one. And this wasn't open to the 
public."

CUSTODY CASE REACHES THE APPEAL LEVEL; 
</P>
<P>
ARGUMENTS: SOME CIVIL RIGHTS AND FAMILY LAW EXPERTS HAVE CONDEMNED THE COURT 
ORDER THAT FORCED THE MOTHER AND HER 6-YEAR-OLD SON TO MOVE TO VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ventura County Superior Court gave Pamela Besser a choice: move with her 
6-year-old son near her ex-husband in Ventura County or give up custody of the 
boy altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Besser chose to move, but she appealed the court's 1988 order. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Besser's appeal reached the 2nd District Court of Appeal in the 
Santa Barbara County Government Center. There, Justice Arthur Gilbert called 
the lower court's order "not much of a choice" for Besser. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert and Justices Steven J. Stone and Richard W. Abbe heard oral arguments 
Wednesday on the appeal, but they have not decided whether to overturn the 
Ventura County Superior Court order. 
</P>
<P>
That decision could come as soon as next month, said ACLU attorney Jon 
Davidson, who argued on Besser's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The case has become a cause celebre for some civil rights and family law 
experts, who have condemned the court order that has kept Besser and son Joshua 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Davidson argued that the ruling "smacks of gender bias" and 
forced Besser to quit her job, friends and temple so her husband, Michael 
Fingert, could conveniently visit their son Joshua, now age 8. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the kind of order that's in the discretion of the lower court to 
make," Davidson told the justices. "It favored the father's convenience in 
seeing his son on visitation rights over the mother's right to maintain her 
home, her job and her community." 
</P>
<P>
Fingert's attorney, Richard Taylor, let an earlier filed brief stand as his 
argument and made few comments at the hearing before the appeal court. 
</P>
<P>
The brief said, in part, "The father's interests just happened to coincide with 
the child's best interests" and Besser's lack of ties to the Bay Area. Taylor 
also argued that Davidson had no legal grounds to bring the case to the appeal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Besser, now remarried to and pregnant by another man who shares her desire to 
return to the Bay Area, issued a written statement that said: 
</P>
<P>
"How do you explain to a child who is constantly asking why and when can we go 
to San Francisco?" 
</P>
<P>
Fingert and Besser were high school sweethearts from age 16. They moved in 
together in 1970 and married six years later, moving to Ventura in 1979 so 
Fingert could start a bolt business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Besser became pregnant, which, she said, displeased Fingert. He moved 
out of their East Ventura residence. In 1982, during the last month of Besser's 
pregnancy, he filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua was born Feb. 1, 1982. The divorce court later granted full custody to 
his mother and visitation rights to his father, who rarely visited the boy even 
though he lived two miles away, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
When Besser announced plans to move to Chicago, Fingert got a restraining order 
prohibiting her from removing the boy from California without his approval. She 
instead took him to San Diego. He lived with his mother three weeks out of the 
month. Every fourth week, Besser drove Joshua to an Anaheim restaurant and 
handed him over to Fingert, who would return him seven days later, court 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Besser moved to Foster City, near San Francisco. Every fourth week, 
court records show, she would put Joshua on a plane to Ventura to visit his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, the trips were causing Joshua severe stomachaches, crying jags, 
depression and alienation from his schoolmates, Besser said. He was attending 
one school three weeks a month and another school one week a month. 
</P>
<P>
Besser and Fingert went to Ventura County Superior Court to seek a better 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Besser argued in favor of giving custody of Joshua to Fingert on weekends, 
holidays and summers so he could continue his schooling. But Fingert argued 
that it would be better for his son and ex-wife to move back to Ventura so the 
boy could stay at one school, moving back and forth from one parent to the 
other every year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Judge Charles McGrath followed the recommendations of a 
court-appointed psychiatrist. He ordered Besser to move with Joshua back to 
Ventura County or give up her child. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's hearing, Besser said she was encouraged by Gilbert's remarks 
but insisted she won't settle for a victory in her own case. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a law," she said. "I want to move, and I want a law" to forbid courts 
from imposing such an arrangement ever again.

TOWN BIDS ADIEU TO 'REAL SWEETHEART'; 
</P>
<P>
FILLMORE: TWO MEMBERS OF THE MARINE CORPS ARE AMONG THOSE PAYING THEIR 
RESPECTS. JAMES ANDERSON HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO REPORT TO BOOT CAMP IN AUGUST.

James Anderson, remembered as "the kid with the glasses" and a "real 
sweetheart," was buried Wednesday in a country cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The grave site in rural Bardsdale is within walking distance of the home that 
Anderson shared with his parents, three brothers and three sisters. 
</P>
<P>
It's just across the Santa Clara River from Fillmore, where Anderson graduated 
from high school last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And it's only a few miles from the curve where, a few hours later, a man 
suspected of drunk driving lost control of his car and smashed into a pole, 
killing Anderson, who was riding in the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
In Fillmore, life unfolds in a small circle, and when it ends suddenly, as it 
did for 18-year-old Jimmy Anderson, the whole town mourns. 
</P>
<P>
"This community is close-knit. It's like going back into the '60s," said 
Suzette Jordan, a receptionist at the Skillin-Carroll Mortuary who was still 
getting inquiries Wednesday morning about Anderson's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone was driving me nuts until the arrangements were made," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
She said lots of people knew Jimmy Anderson, partly because of the glasses he 
had worn since age 2, partly because he was always working at some odd job, 
such as packing groceries at Central Market, cleaning houses or baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
While Jordan took phone calls, Virginia Mickelson, Anderson's art teacher at 
Fillmore Senior High School across the street, stopped by the mortuary on her 
way to the funeral. She had postponed an airplane trip to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a hard time with school, but he was a real sweetheart," Mickelson said. 
"Everybody liked him. He was kind of reserved but always had this nice smile." 
</P>
<P>
Several Fillmore High teachers and dozens of students were among the more than 
200 mourners who packed into the funeral at the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Two representatives of the Marine Corps also paid their 
respects. Anderson had enlisted in the Marines last fall and was scheduled to 
report to boot camp in August. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the closed casket was Anderson's graduation photo, in which he struck a 
serious pose that did not include the customary eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Michael Burnett said the family favored no particular charity but 
suggested Students Against Driving Drunk to those wishing to contribute in 
Jimmy's name. The only other reference to alcohol came during the opening 
prayer by Anderson's older brother, Alan. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope," he said, pausing several times, "that everyone in the world realizes 
that alcohol is an addiction, and it's very bad." 
</P>
<P>
Justin Neff, 20, the man arrested after the accident on suspicion of drunk 
driving, has two prior drunk-driving convictions, one of which came only two 
days before the crash. He was in guarded condition Wednesday at the Ventura 
County Medical Center, where he is being treated for internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol spokesman said the agency is still interviewing 
witnesses who were with Neff before the accident. When the investigation is 
completed, the district attorney's office will decide whether to charge Neff 
with manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Neff was giving Anderson a ride home from a post-graduation party 
when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson remembered seeing Anderson among the 156 graduates at commencement 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was uncanny," the art teacher said, recalling a speech in which class 
President Gloria Conejo mentioned the sudden deaths of five other Fillmore High 
students during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
"We must live our lives to the fullest every day," Conejo had said. "We never 
know if tomorrow may ever come." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Farrell, publisher of the weekly Fillmore Gazette, recalled the same 
five deaths in a column on June 8, a week before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Noting "the extra exuberance of our high school students" as graduation neared, 
Farrell mused: "I wonder how many of our students will heed the warnings they 
will receive about drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could speak to our seniors individually," Farrell wrote. "I would say 
that we would all like to see them again, after graduation, alive and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Would they listen, or laugh it off?" 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much laughter in Fillmore on Wednesday. But tears flowed freely.

POINT MUGU: THE NAVY ALLOWS A RARE GLIMPSE OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE THAT PLOTS 
TERRAIN MORE EFFECTIVELY AND JUDGES ALTITUDE MORE PRECISELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Navy opened the doors Wednesday into one of its most secret installations 
at Point Mugu -- a computer nerve center where electronic warfare experts can 
plot military battle strategies. 
</P>
<P>
The latest refinements in the Navy's strategic capability, officials said, 
include the development of three-dimensional maps that can be called up on 
computer screens to show virtually every region in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing color-coded geometrics as an overlay over the new maps, Navy 
strategists at Point Mugu's Pacific Missile Test Center can plot terrain more 
effectively and judge altitude more precisely, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Secret computer software has assisted Navy fighters since the Vietnam era but 
only in two dimensions. In January, officials said, the three-dimensional maps 
were developed and now cover areas of the world from the Middle East to Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"The person that's going to win all of the conflicts now is going to be the 
person who can control the electronic environment," said Terry Clark, a 
director of Point Mugu's Electronic Warfare Directorate. "This is what allows 
the United States to win a war of attrition." 
</P>
<P>
Officials provided the rare glimpse of the Navy's testing technology to the 
public during a press tour Wednesday of the main Electronic Warfare Building at 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The complex computer system is called the TEAMS system -- Tactical EA-6B 
Missile Support -- and was first developed in 1983. Clark said it now enables 
fighters to ask, "What altitude can I be at, at a certain position, and not be 
seen and not be shot?" 
</P>
<P>
Officers and pilots can plan their mission on ground and load a cassette into 
the back of an EA-6B plane in less than 2 1/2 minutes, Clark said, allowing use 
of the new technology in actual combat situations. The plane has four seats, 
two for the pilots and two for strategists. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to let the guy that's going to get shot out there make the decisions," 
said Dave Cronk, site manager for PRB Associates, a company based in Hollywood, 
Md., that contracts with the Navy to build such systems. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the new computer capabilities at Point Mugu are an improvement of 
TEAMS system technology that played a significant role during the U.S. attack 
on Libya four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The battlefield of tomorrow is already extremely dense with radars and 
electromagnetic signals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer panels at Point Mugu flash intricate geometric shapes in red, 
green and blue. During Wednesday's demonstration, Cronk called up a map of the 
Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, then focused on Oman. 
</P>
<P>
"We can narrow it down to a small coastline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's press tour, officials stressed the Navy's concerns with 
local environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Mugu Lagoon, the only lagoon in Southern California with a year-round 
entrance to the ocean, is home to many endangered species, including the brown 
pelican. On Wednesday, harbor seals slept on the lagoon's shores as the tour 
proceeded. 
</P>

REPORT FAULTS COUNTY, POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST;

Police psychologist Michael R. Mantell and San Diego County are not providing a 
"well-established and fully functional" program to screen applicants for 
high-stress jobs as sheriff's deputies, marshals and probation officers, 
according to a hard-hitting report approved Wednesday by the county Civil 
Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the result of an 18-month investigation of Mantell and the county 
Department of Human Resources, also confirmed many complaints about how law 
enforcement applicants were treated in Mantell's psychological program. The 
commission's study found that many psychological interviews lasted only five 
minutes, and that Mantell often submitted "computerized" reports on job 
applicants rather than individually written evaluations of their suitability 
for police work. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommended a series of specific actions to improve the screening 
program, but it stopped short of suggesting that Mantell's contract with the 
county be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no authority for us to order something like that," said chairwoman 
Deanna Spehn, noting that the report instead calls for tougher monitoring of 
Mantell's work until his contract comes up for renewal next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've studied this thing back and forth and up and down, and the 
recommendations we are making are good ones," she said. "There were problems, 
and now there's a way to fix them." 
</P>
<P>
Her year-and-a-half investigation is the longest inquiry ever undertaken by the 
commission, she said, and her fellow members voted unanimously Wednesday to 
approve her findings and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working on this a long time," she said. "We want to make sure 
people are treated fairly and equitably here." 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Chastain, director of the county Department of Human Resources, which 
oversees the Mantell contract, reserved her thoughts on the commission's 
findings. "I'm not going to comment today on something that thick," she said 
Wednesday about the lengthy report. "I'll have to read it first." 
</P>
<P>
Mantell could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report comes on the heels of Mantell losing his contract for 
similar services with the city of San Diego, where he has worked as a police 
psychologist for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the city manager recommended that the City Council skip 
over Mantell this year and award the contract to a team of four other 
psychological service providers. City officials cited no specific complaints 
and said their recommendation was not a rebuke of Mantell's 
</P>
<P>
work with the San Diego Police Department, but rather an effort to see what 
other psychological groups could provide. 
</P>
<P>
The county investigation released Wednesday found many problems in the way the 
Department of Human Resources administered Mantell's contract. 
</P>
<P>
"DHR does not have a well-established and fully functional pre-employment 
psychological program," the report said. "The program lacks a well-managed, 
comprehensive monitoring system. Certain facets of the pre-employment 
psychological program have not been administered appropriately. It has been 
fraught with numerous inconsistencies." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commission found that the Department of Human Resources "did 
not research and develop a comprehensive" search for other psychological groups 
when it signed a new contract with Mantell earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
And the commission determined that monitoring of Mantell's prior job contract, 
which ran from 1986 to this year, was "minimal at best and lax at worst." 
</P>
<P>
The county investigation began in October 1988, when Jack Arnold, a probation 
officer candidate, filed a complaint about Mantell's psychological testing 
environment and interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of Jack Arnold's allegations are true in that the testing environment was 
less than optimum, and the interview was inadequate for his evaluation," the 
report found. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also learned that Arnold "was given a lengthy written 
examination in a busy reception area without the use of a table or desk, and he 
was interrupted during the written examination and was given a five-minute 
interview." 
</P>
<P>
With similar complaints also coming in, the commission decided to study the 
entire psychological pre-screening program and almost immediately found that 
supervisors in the Department of Human Resources were defensive about their 
supervision of Mantell's contract. 
</P>
<P>
"It is evident," the report said, "that DHR took this reactive approach because 
it believed the program was functioning adequately, even though there had been 
numerous complaints." 
</P>
<P>
But, as the investigation progressed, the Department of Human Resources did 
make strides to tighten up its supervision of the contract. In January, the 
department asked Mantell to provide a more suitable testing environment, which 
he did, the report said. The department also asked him to conduct interviews 
for at least 30 minutes, which he said he was doing. However, the report found 
that complaints are still being lodged about the length of his interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also found that Mantell was submitting computer-generated 
reports on individual job applicants that were "virtually identical, word for 
word, except for gender references, for different candidates for peace officer 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the commission said, Mantell has agreed not to use the computer 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
But other problems continue, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Mantell uses "low, medium and high" categories to rate 
applicants, which, the commission said, has caused some problems. "Lately," the 
commission found, "the reports submitted by Dr. Mantell have indicated that 
certain candidates have behavioral problems which should be monitored. However, 
these same candidates are being passed." 
</P>
<P>
One applicant with a history of serious cocaine and LSD drug abuse was passed 
in his first psychological evaluation, the report said, as was another 
candidate whose psychological profile indicated that he was unsuitable for 
police work. In another instance, Mantell's evaluations of two candidates were 
inadvertently switched, resulting in a candidate who should have failed being 
passed, and vice versa, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In its recommendations, the commission said the Department of Human resources 
should: 
</P>
<P>
* Consult with outside agencies, such as the American Psychological Assn. and 
the Peace Officer Standards and Training organization, to see how the county's 
program can be improved. 
</P>
<P>
* Regularly meet with the sheriff, marshal and probation departments to ensure 
that applicants are being properly tested. 
</P>
<P>
* Make periodic on-site visits to Mantell's offices in Mission Valley.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 ARRESTED IN FIGHTS AT LYNWOOD HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One youth was arrested but no one was hurt in a spate of fights between 
students at Lynwood High School Wednesday, the last day of the school year, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the about 3,000 students on campus, an estimated 100 were involved in the 
approximately 15 brawls that erupted about 1 p.m. outside classes at the 
school, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Don Slawson said. 
</P>
<P>
No reason for the violence was immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people were just feeling their oats," Slawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies converged on the campus, "emptying the whole school and 
sending everybody home," Slawson said. Order was restored by about 2 p.m., he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One youth was arrested, but details were not immediately available. He was not 
identified because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
School officials declined comment.

REPORTER'S VISIT TO SILBERMAN JUROR'S HOME IS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Tribune reporter visited the home of a juror in the Richard T. 
Silberman money-laundering trial Wednesday, prompting the judge presiding over 
the case to call a hearing today to learn whether anything improper occurred. 
</P>
<P>
At a hastily called hearing late Wednesday, a lawyer for the newspaper, Edward 
J. McIntyre, said its editors were "one, embarrassed and, two, livid" about the 
incident. Communication with jurors about a case they are considering is 
forbidden by the court. 
</P>
<P>
The paper's deputy editor said its management is "sorry" about the visit but 
insisted that no harm was done because the reporter, Susan Shroder, did not 
speak with juror Sandra Costa, but with Costa's son, deputy editor Robert Witty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The visit occurred as the jury was completing its second day of deliberations. 
In four notes to U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, the panel asked to 
listen to several secretly recorded tapes in the case and indicated it was 
prepared to continue discussing the case into next week. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, a San Diego financier and one-time aide to former Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr., is accused of laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent 
allegedly told Silberman was the proceeds of Colombian cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, he faces up to 75 years in prison. His trial ran for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Irving has not released information -- including addresses and phone numbers -- 
about any of the jurors. At a hearing on that matter Wednesday morning, he 
agreed with McIntyre, the Tribune attorney, that he was obligated to release 
that sort of data but did not provide it immediately to give Silberman's 
defense attorneys time to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Shroder visited Costa's home in Lake Morena Village, near Campo, Wednesday 
afternoon to confirm Costa's phone number, which the paper intended to use to 
speak with Costa after the jury returns its verdict, deputy editor Witty said. 
She confirmed the number, obtained through other sources, with a man who 
identified himself as Costa's son and then left, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the son was not immediately available. At the time, juror Costa was 
at the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Shroder, 36, who has been with the Tribune for more than two years, has not 
covered the Silberman trial regularly but is one of several writers the paper 
has ready to help cover the case once the jury verdict is returned. She 
referred calls Wednesday to Tribune attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody sent her," deputy editor Witty said, adding that 'they 
did not ask her to knock on the door. She was not instructed to talk to anybody 
at the house, and we're sorry she did." But he added that, since Shroder made 
no attempt to talk to juror Costa, "I don't think any great harm was done." 
</P>
<P>
Jury tampering is a criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said late Wednesday that he wants Shroder to appear today in court to 
explain what happened. She is expected to appear. 
</P>
<P>
In its notes, the jury told Irving on Wednesday that it wanted to listen to 
three tapes, including one between Silberman and the undercover FBI agent, 
Peter Ahearn, in which Ahearn tells Silberman that his cash comes from "a bunch 
of . . . Colombian drug lords." 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the case is whether Silberman believed the cash was drug 
money. Much of the evidence in the case comes from recordings gathered through 
wiretaps and hidden body recorders. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also wondered whether members could leave an hour early today, a 
request that Irving granted.

GRADUATION DAY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: FOR 543 EIGHTH-GRADERS, EVENT WAS FILLED WITH THE THRILL OF THE 
MOMENT AND DREAMS OF THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They don't call it commencement "exercises" for nothing. Just ask the 543 
eighth-graders who gathered on the lawn at San Marcos Junior High Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Just 24 hours before, as the afternoon sun beat down on 13 rows of folding 
chairs on the school's well-kept lawn, Principal Susan Maki had led the 
students in a series of drills -- all part of a good-natured attempt to make 
Wednesday's rite of passage as graceful as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Spit your gum out, or you'll look like a bunch of cows that haven't eaten in a 
few days," she had told her students, mostly 14-year-olds, during a 
commencement rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
"No hats," Maki had said to a chorus of jeers as the teen-agers obediently 
stood up, sat down, and walked on command. "No sunglasses." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, their hard work paid off. More than 1,500 spectators -- some 
sporting state-of-the-art home video cameras -- focused their attention on the 
soon-to-be high schoolers who wore everything from shimmering blue and green 
gowns to T-shirts and high tops instead of traditional caps and gowns. Come 
fall, these same kids will blend into the anonymous world of high school -- 
just a few of the estimated 29,000 teen-agers who will enroll in the ninth 
grade in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Whether high school will be "just the same as junior high" as 14-year-old Rocky 
Jones predicted, or have "a lot more homework" as Brian Peterson feared, or 
whether Ken Motts' worries about making friends in the megalopolis of San 
Marcos High School (enrollment 1,800) come to fruition, everyone seemed to 
agree on one thing: they were ready to leave junior high long before 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're outta here and going to high school," Jason Wright, 14, said. "More 
sports, more funner, and more people to be around." 
</P>
<P>
"More girls," chimed in 15-year-old Peter Janic. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the other side of the practice field, a shy eighth-grader had 
similar hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cuter guys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For all its import, the commencement was in some ways a familiar exercise: it 
began, as do most schoolroom functions, with an alphabetical recitation of 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"Wassin Abifaher, Aurelio Adame, Chad Adams . . . came the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Beeson, who was blessed with a place near the front of the alphabet, 
downplayed the importance of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think high school graduation will be more important than this one, because 
that means real freedom," the 14-year-old said, adding that the main hurdle 
between himself and freedom was a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Maki relieved the students by announcing that her remarks would be brief. "The 
message from the principal is mostly 'Have a nice life,' " she had said 
Tuesday. And, true to her word, her comments lasted less than two minutes, 
sprinkled with phrases such as "you have exemplified yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The recitation continued, complete with eager comments from the graduating 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"Hal-ee, not Hay-lee," the students chastised Maki after successive 
mispronunciations. 
</P>
<P>
"Paris Stapp, Frederick Starr, Alicia Stevens . . . " the roll call continued. 
And, finally, "Jason Wright, Gustave Yohner, Adrienne Zeiler and Heather 
Zetterberg."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL BOARD OKS $8 MILLION IN CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas from parents, students and teachers to restore funding for 
certain extracurricular programs, Simi Valley school officials have approved a 
$73.7-million budget after cutting $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
To balance the budget, the district laid off 32 temporary teachers and 28 
clerical and service employees, including five nurses, and made other program 
cuts. The district had to use $4.1 million of its reserve funds, Supt. John 
Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget is based on a 3% cost-of-living increase from the state, although 
the number could increase when the state passes its budget this summer, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making our estimates based on the state's budget, and this year is a 
pretty gloomy year," said Helen Beebe, Board of Education president. "If we get 
a higher raise, we're going to look at restoring some of the positions that 
were cut." 
</P>
<P>
Several parents, students and teachers urged the board to restore about $60,000 
in funding for speech and debate and work experience programs. The board did 
not restore funding for them. 
</P>
<P>
Others picketed the meeting to protest a proposal by Duncan to increase the 
salaries of the district's top four administrators, including his own. Duncan's 
salary would increase from $96,517 to $97,000. Salaries for associate 
superintendents Al Jacobs and Cathi Vogel would be raised from $79,252 and 
$78,917, respectively, to $80,000, and Assistant Supt. Mary Beth Wolford's pay 
would increase from $74,273 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the administrators' contracts would begin in January instead of 
June to correspond with the district's fiscal year. They would receive the same 
cost-of-living increase that is approved in the upcoming state budget, Duncan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the idea of a raise that is the problem here tonight, it is the 
timing of the raises," said foreign language teacher Peggie Noisette, one of 
150 in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Board members postponed voting on the issue, saying they would review the 
matter and possibly reconsider it after the state's budget is finalized. Board 
member Diane Collins objected to reconsidering the proposal, calling it "an 
outright bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the board approved an adjusted salary schedule for teachers, correcting a 
clerical error that resulted in a $350,000 overpayment to the district's 750 
teachers last year. The scale for beginning teachers will be reduced from 
$20,863 to $20,643 a year, and the top scale from $46,689 to $46,197. 
</P>
<P>
Union and district officials agreed that the money will be repaid by payroll 
deductions of between $200 to $400 per teacher for 10 months beginning in 
September. STEPHANIE STASSEL

CAMPAIGN SPENDING CAP PUT ON HOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council will wait until after the November election to discuss 
voluntary limits on campaign spending, despite objections from one member. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron proposed that council members informally agree to 
place limits on how much they spend on their election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Gary L. Gillig, who researched the issue for the council, said 
that although state and federal laws limit campaign contributions, laws 
limiting spending are unconstitutional because they violate the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates could agree to limit how much they spend on their races, but the 
council could not penalize candidates who do not want to participate, Gillig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Maron suggested limiting spending to 50 cents per voter or about $23,000 per 
campaign but was less adamant about the actual amount than about the need for a 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
She said the council should establish the limit now to exert political pressure 
on challengers to spend less. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Manuel Lopez questioned whether council members should speak for 
potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we make an agreement for someone we don't know is running?" Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi, whose campaign budget in 1988 exceeded $68,000, opposed 
setting up regulations for other candidates and said campaign reform should be 
made by an outside citizens committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not give up my constitutional right to what I can do to keep my seat in 
office," Takasugi said. 
</P>
<P>
Maron questioned whether candidates can ethically vote on issues when they have 
received donations from people supporting those issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they voting their conscience or are they voting their debt?" Maron asked. 
</P>
<P>
Although official announcements have not been made, Maron is expected to run 
for mayor in November. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

HAWTHORNE PRINCIPAL HUNTS FOR JOB; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: KENNETH CROWE'S CHILLY RELATIONS WITH THE CENTINELA VALLEY UNIFIED 
SCHOOLS COULD END IF HE GETS A POST IN INGLEWOOD. 
</P>

<P>
Hawthorne High School Principal Kenneth Crowe, who faces reassignment at the 
end of the school year, has applied for a job with the Inglewood Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
His current employer, the Centinela Valley Union High School District, has been 
beset by racial tensions and conflicts between administrators and school board 
members. Crowe's pending reassignment has been one of the most divisive recent 
issues in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Supt. George McKenna, who supervised Crowe several years ago at 
Washington High School in Los Angeles, confirmed that Crowe is one of several 
candidates interviewing for a principal's job at an Inglewood secondary school. 
Despite their former relationship, McKenna said, Crowe did not ask him for a 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood district began compiling a list of candidates for the principal's 
job after the board of trustees voted last month to reassign Inglewood High 
School Principal Lawrence Freeman, who has been under fire for his leadership 
style and strict disciplinary measures. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood school board member Zyra McCloud said Monday that she considers Crowe 
a strong candidate for the principalship "in that he has done an excellent job 
at Hawthorne." 
</P>
<P>
But McCloud said she would like the school board to reconsider the reassignment 
of Freeman, who has been on sick leave since May 1, when racial tensions 
erupted into fistfights between black and Latino students at Inglewood High. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe was among the top three applicants for the principal's job at Duarte High 
School but was passed over last week when the Duarte Unified School District 
board decided instead to promote someone from within the district. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte Supt. Robert M. Packer described Crowe as "very professional, a viable 
applicant" and "a very competent candidate." Crowe's conflict with the 
Centinela Valley school board played no role in the decision to fill the 
vacancy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe declined to comment Tuesday about his employment plans, saying they are 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe started at Hawthorne High in 1985 as dean of students before being 
promoted the next year to assistant principal. In February, 1988, he became 
principal. He oversaw several changes at the school, including the reassignment 
of more than 30 teachers who had been teaching in areas for which they lacked 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly white teachers union bristled at the reassignments and 
accused Crowe, who is black, of favoritism and poor management skills. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said he was a victim of racism and accused the school board of not moving 
fast enough to eradicate racial tensions in the school. In early March, Crowe 
resigned as principal after being told that he would be reassigned at the end 
of the school year, which is June 30 for school staff. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation, and allegations that the board's decision to reassign him was 
racially motivated, sparked student walkouts on March 5 and 6. Crowe later 
asked the board to rescind his resignation. He said the board instead ordered 
him placed on medical leave, even though he said he is not ill. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remains principal through the end of school year, his status has 
become a heated issue among members of the black community, who have also 
accused the predominantly Latino school board of being racist in its dealings 
with Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe has filed a claim with the state Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing, alleging racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along that I want the board to rescind their action, and I still 
stand by that," Crowe said Tuesday. "There is no legal reason why I was 
reassigned. I've done everything that is expected of me as principal." 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as principal, he said, the school's dropout rate improved and 
more students enrolled in college preparatory classes. Graffiti and gang 
activity have been curtailed at the campus, and the number of students taking 
college entrance exams has risen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that, if I were white, instead of reassigning me they would 
have had a parade down Hawthorne Boulevard," Crowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. McKinley Nash, who spoke in support of Crowe at a board meeting last 
month, said Tuesday that, despite "what happened in this school district, if I 
had a chance to hire him tomorrow, I would do it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The trustees have denied that Crowe's race played a role in any of their 
actions but have declined to comment on their plans for him, citing board 
policy against discussing personnel matters in public. 
</P>
<P>
District procedure requires that all reassignments be made by June 30.

BATTLE OF LAWSUITS TEETERS ON WAR AS CITIES TRY TO STOP DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A simmering feud between Culver City and Los Angeles over massive developments 
in the Lincoln Boulevard corridor has escalated into a full-scale border war 
with each side threatening to hold the other's project hostage. 
</P>
<P>
The latest clash occurred at a Los Angeles City Council committee hearing this 
week, when Culver City representatives laid the groundwork for an expected 
lawsuit against the $400-million Channel Gateway project near Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City contends that the environmental impact report on the residential 
and office complex is inadequate and that Los Angeles has failed to follow 
proper procedures in considering the development. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the legal posturing lies another apparent motive: retaliation for 
Los Angeles suing to stop the $160-million Marina Place regional shopping mall 
in Culver City. The shopping center would be built on Washington Boulevard, 
three blocks from the Channel Gateway site in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A heated competition between the two cities over traffic capacity in the 
heavily congested Lincoln corridor threatens to create a kind of legal gridlock 
that could tie up major developments in the area for years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Channel Gateway project and its luxury condominiums, clustered 
apartments and office building are caught in the fight between neighboring 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm troubled that this project has become a hostage in our ongoing border 
war," Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter told her city's Planning and 
Land Use Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
To address some of the legal issues raised by Culver City, Galanter suggested a 
number of changes to the Channel Gateway proposal, unanimously approved by the 
Los Angeles Planning Commission, and a public hearing on coastal issues was 
extended until July 10. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-acre project still must receive approval from the City Council and state 
Coastal Commission, and Galanter said she saw no end to the legal brinkmanship, 
declaring that Los Angeles has no intention of dropping the lawsuit against 
Marina Place unless the project is dramatically altered.

HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION SATURDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Oxnard and the Ventura Regional Sanitation District are sponsoring 
a household hazardous waste collection on Saturday for Oxnard residents who 
would like to dispose of pesticides, paint thinners and other chemical waste. 
</P>
<P>
The waste will be collected from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Oxnard Equipment Yard, 
1060 Pacific Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptable items for disposal include poisons, corrosives, furniture and auto 
polish, varnishes, pool chlorine, acids and wood preservatives. 
</P>
<P>
John Zaragoza, refuse superintendent for the city's Solid Waste Division, said 
people should not dispose of those items in their regular trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had refuse operators who have gotten hurt when acid splashed in their 
faces," Zaragoza said. "Those materials also contaminate the landfill sites 
when they seep through the soil into aquifers." 
</P>
<P>
The collection-day crews will not accept materials that can be recycled at the 
Bailard Landfill, such as oil- and water-based paints, used motor oil, 
antifreeze and automobile batteries. JOANNA M. MILLER

<P>
In an effort to slow driving speeds in Camarillo, the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department will set up a radar-equipped trailer on city streets that will 
display the speed of an approaching car. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to showing the actual speed of cars, the trailer's scoreboard will 
display the proper speed limit, Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings up the level of awareness of how fast people are driving," Boyd 
said. "It is an educational tool." 
</P>
<P>
The trailer will be placed on different streets each day, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the unit, which costs $7,570, was donated by the Tri-County Traffic 
School of Thousand Oaks, which runs classes for people who have received 
traffic tickets, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer will be presented to the Camarillo City Council on Wednesday and 
then will be put out on the streets, Boyd said. CAROL WATSON

RECYCLING NETS CARSON TRASH PACT FOR 1 FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With one South Bay city after another grappling with the costs of 
state-mandated recycling, Carson has come up with a new wrinkle to pay for a 
citywide program that goes into effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
In return for providing free curbside recycling service, Western Waste of 
Gardena has been granted an expansion of its residential trash franchise with 
the city to cover all commercial and industrial waste as well. The move freezes 
out other waste hauling companies, which currently pick up nonresidential trash 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that the commercial and industrial contract, which has 
renewable options for Western Waste, will produce gross annual revenues of $5 
million for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The push for recycling stems from a state law that mandates a 25% reduction in 
trash delivered to landfills by 1995 and a 50% reduction by 2000. Most South 
Bay cities either have a recycling program in place or are making plans to 
begin one soon. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in three South Bay cities that have recycling programs said in 
interviews that they do not have a similar arrangement linking their recycling 
program to a franchise expansion. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Ron Pfeifer, district manager of BFI Waste 
Systems, complained that the council had not sought bids before it awarded 
Western Waste the exclusive commercial and industrial franchise on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that there is no legal bar to awarding an exclusive franchise 
without competitive bidding, Pfeifer said it is unfair and that BFI stands to 
lose about $1 million in commercial and industrial trash collection fees in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"We take a marketplace that generates $5 million in revenue annually and give 
it to (Western Waste) without a bid, and not only give it to them, but give it 
to them as an evergreen contract," with renewal rights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Chicago. I haven't seen this sort of stuff since Mayor (Richard J.) 
Daley died." 
</P>
<P>
But his complaint was to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Kay Calas said that BFI had the city's residential trash contract 
for a number of years and that Pfeifer was complaining now only because he was 
not the chosen one. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Mitoma added that BFI is in a poor position to object, 
because it has had a trash contract in Hermosa Beach for 22 years without 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Heredia, president of the Carson/Dominguez Business Council, a group of 
two dozen Carson businesses that monitors council actions, said at the meeting 
that the council should have notified businesses that trash collection was 
coming up before the franchise expansion was approved. 
</P>
<P>
"The business council is concerned that the City Council's action takes away 
the right to choose a vendor." Heredia said. "There was no notice given to the 
business community." 
</P>
<P>
Heredia added that businesses are fearful that their rates will be raised, in 
part to cover costs of the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitoma said state law provides a five-year grace period that protects 
existing trash-hauling fees and arrangements, if a city awards an exclusive 
garbage contract. "It's a win-win situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That provision means that, although the exclusive franchise will officially go 
into effect on July 1, it could be up to five years before Western Waste takes 
over all existing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing to expand Western Waste's franchise, the council rejected an 
alternative to charge residential customers $1.25 a month for the recycling 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Carson officials reported contacting 14 Southern California cities about 
recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach and Rancho Palos Verdes said in 
interviews that they were unaware of an arrangement quite like Carson's. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Montgomery, Redondo Beach director of public works, said his city will 
probably select a small number of firms eligible to collect commercial and 
industrial trash. Those companies would then compete for customers. Montgomery 
said he expects that some trash collection firms will offer free recycling in 
bidding to get on the city's approved list. 
</P>
<P>
"They might throw that in to get the business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach, which began its program last July, charges residential customers 
$1 a month per housing unit for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, the City Council put the trash contract out to bid and 
selected Western Waste to handle all residential and commercial waste, 
according to Carson officials. The charge for recycling is 70 cents a month per 
unit, but 50 cents is returned to customers as long as more than 50% of the 
city's households participate in the program, according to a Manhattan Beach 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program started Dec. 4, participation has been above 50%, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
In Rancho Palos Verdes, which started its recycling program in 1988, the fee is 
$1.38 a month, an official said. Torrance charges $2.18 a month in a pilot 
program, according to the Carson study. 
</P>
<P>
In Burbank, residents are not charged for the recycling program, and the city, 
which bought and maintains trucks and containers, receives funds from the trash 
collector, the Carson report said. 
</P>
<P>
In Walnut, the recycling charge is $1.20 a month, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
No recycling programs were reported in Inglewood, Gardena, Cypress, Huntington 
Beach, Cerritos, Long Beach, Buena Park and Lakewood.

FUN FOR THE YOUNG; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVITIES: HUNDREDS OF ANTIDOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO REFUTE YOUNGSTERS' AGE-OLD 
SUMMER COMPLAINT -- 'THERE'S NOTHING TO DO!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With vacation just beginning, organizations all over the South Bay are working 
to keep young people this summer from ever having to say: "I'm bored. There's 
nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Parents who have waited until the last minute to plan entertainment for their 
children will find that scores of classes and dozens of public and private 
camps still have openings. 
</P>
<P>
Available are a surfing class in Hermosa Beach, horseback riding in Palos 
Verdes, arts and crafts in Inglewood, piano playing in Hawthorne, pumping iron 
in Torrance and beach bingo on Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
If those events prove too mundane, how about contests in gum-blowing, 
frog-jumping and lip-syncing? Or a crash course on the stock market at Los 
Angeles Harbor College for pint-sized brokers? 
</P>
<P>
The various activities range from one-time sessions to summer-long programs and 
are being sponsored by camps, community organizations, colleges and city 
recreation departments. 
</P>
<P>
Day camps throughout the area have openings, including one that welcomes the 
entire family, sponsored by the Gardena YMCA. Held at Lake Sequoia in the San 
Joaquin Valley over Labor Day weekend, the camp allows parents and children "to 
do a lot of goofy things that people don't do in the city," such as 
frog-jumping contests, said the YMCA's Jenny Mulhollin. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking refuge from the heat will find swimming lessons offered at pool 
after pool and, cooler still, ice-skating instruction at Ice Capades Chalet in 
Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
There are programs in volleyball, softball, soccer, tennis, ballet and 
aerobics, a two-week Kung Fu Camp at Hesse Park in Rancho Palos Verdes, and a 
jazz dancing class at the Hermosa Beach Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to be hanging out in your body for 70 years, you should learn 
to move it right," said Mona Jean Cedar, a professional dancer who will teach 
the jazz dance class for children 8 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
Children will not only dance to music by Paula Abdul, New Kids on the Block and 
other popular artists, they also will learn the "difference between nightclub 
dancing and trained dancing," Cedar said. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing instructor Jim Cubberley, who has been riding waves for 30 of his 40 
years, will share his expertise at Hermosa Beach. He says his classes are most 
popular among those who live near the beach and who grew up elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people that have the California beach lifestyle in their head 
-- girls, volleyball, surfing," he said. "Many of them are from places like New 
York and Chicago and have always wanted to come out to California to learn to 
surf." 
</P>
<P>
The surfing classes are open to those 17 and over. A popular body-boarding 
course that Cubberley teaches for children 8 and over is already closed. 
</P>
<P>
Those more interested in exercising their brains than their muscles will find 
chess instruction offered by the Gardena Recreation and Human Services 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
National master Robert Snyder said his classes, open to children 7 to 15, are 
as much entertainment as instruction. He use rhymes such as Knights on the rim 
are dim to teach youngsters the strategies of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Other academic activities will be offered at the "College for Kids" program at 
Harbor College in Wilmington. At the stock market course, children 10 to 14 
will learn the differences between commercial banks and savings and loans, and 
delve into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit and individual 
retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"If kids can get the basic concept of saving money when they're young, they'll 
be in a better position later on," said instructor Gary Cummings, a financial 
planner based in Torrance. "Most people spend 40 hours a week working just to 
pay their bills." 
</P>
<P>
Based on past experience, Cummings said, participants will fall into three 
groups when the course is over: those who know more than the average adult does 
about financial planning, those who have some idea of the fundamentals, and 
those who "might as well have been playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Don Brown, associate dean of instruction at El Camino College in Torrance, said 
he is surprised by the number of young people enrolling in the college's basic 
mathematics course for junior high and high school students. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think that would be the last thing a kid would want to take in the 
summer," he said. The college also offers classes in astronomy, weightlifting, 
automotive repair, spelling improvement and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
At county libraries in Lennox, Carson, Hawthorne and other South Bay cities, 
children can earn small prizes for spending their summer months reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids love buttons; kids love stickers, and some of those kids will read that 
book so they can get (them)," said Tom Martinez, youth services coordinator of 
the County of Los Angeles Public Library Western region. "For the kids who 
already read, (the gifts) are just icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in the arts will find many avenues for expression across the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In El Segundo, future actors 9 and over may enroll in a six-week movement class 
that turns everyday movements and situations into dance. Margaret Theriot, who 
developed the concept in a master's thesis at UCLA, will teach the Friday 
morning class. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, the Recreation Department is offering a clown workshop that 
will teach juggling, pantomime, yo-yo tricks and face painting. The class 
begins June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In Hermosa Beach, children 9 to 14 can appear in a production of "The Wizard of 
Oz" at the end of an eight-week theater workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"The main goal is to teach them enough to come up with a production at the end 
of the course," said instructor Linda Locke. "They do learn a lot, but they 
learn by doing." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Tierney, who will teach cartooning in Gardena, expects to see the faces of 
Bart Simpson, Dick Tracy and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles pop up this 
summer in the Sunday morning class for children 8 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
Those in a beginning cooking class at El Camino College will come home with 
different sorts of creations. The catalogue promises "tantalizing recipes and 
informative cooking tips." 
</P>
<P>
At the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, a variety of one-day workshops and 
weeklong camps that delve into the mysteries of the sea and the shore will be 
offered for first-graders through high school students. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the museum's one-day workshops -- "It's a Small World After All" -- 
students will use microscopes and video cameras for detailed study of miniature 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
A weeklong camp called "Ichthyology and Other Slimy Words" will allow fifth- 
and sixth-graders to study sharks and other fish, examine the museum's 36 
aquariums and net sea specimens from Cabrillo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"They are both very popular programs that accomplish a great thing," said 
museum spokeswoman Bee Powell. "They get students acquainted with the ocean 
early in their lives -- and what better thing could you do for the 
environment?"

JURORS TO DECIDE WHETHER TRANSIENT WHO MURDERED GIRL SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fate of a 60-year-old transient who killed a 14-year-old Chatsworth girl 
and shot her friend was placed with a jury Wednesday, with the prosecutor 
urging that Roland Norman Comtois die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"The punishment should fit the crimes," Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold S. Lynn told 
jurors on the final day of the penalty phase of Comtois' trial. "And in this 
case, the crimes are so bad, so violent, so terrible . . . the only appropriate 
verdict you can render is a verdict of death." 
</P>
<P>
Comtois was found guilty June 6 of killing Wendy Masuhara and shooting her 
13-year-old friend and leaving her for dead after kidnaping both girls from 
their Chatsworth neighborhood in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The same jury that convicted Comtois must now decide whether he will die in the 
gas chamber or spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy closing argument, defense attorney James D. Gregory pleaded with 
jurors to show mercy and spare Comtois, who is in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
"The retribution of taking Ray Comtois' life will not bring Wendy back," he 
said. "If it could, that would be another matter. If we kill Ray Comtois, it 
will be just one more death." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, who spoke softly, played on the doubts of jurors and sought to show 
Comtois as a frail, old man who was a good father to his three children. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most awesome decision you will have to make," he said. "Your 
decision could haunt you forever." 
</P>
<P>
He argued that life imprisonment was appropriate for Comtois because of his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is he going to be a danger to in jail?" he asked. "I bet you, ladies and 
gentlemen, he will die a lonely, cruel death. That's what's in store for this 
man." 
</P>
<P>
In a effort to gain sympathy for Comtois, Gregory described the gray-bearded 
defendant's childhood in a Massachusetts orphanage after his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes to an orphanage where he was struck, where he was beaten," he said, 
adding that when Comtois returned to live with his father he was subjected to 
more abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"The discipline in that family was to go out and cut your own switch so your 
Dad could beat you with it. He grew up in pain." 
</P>
<P>
During testimony in the penalty phase of the trial, Gregory relied heavily on a 
collage of photographs depicting Comtois in candid shots playing with his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement, Lynn referred to those photos and then to a police 
photo of the body of Comtois' victim and said loudly: "This is now. This is 
this case. This . . . is why you're here."

TORRANCE LEAGUE SEEKS REVIEW OF COUNCIL WAGES, TERM LENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance League of Women Voters is calling for a thorough review of the 
City Charter, arguing that some sections are obsolete and that the guidelines 
for paying City Council members are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The group also favors limiting council members to two consecutive terms, saying 
that could promote a larger field of candidates in council races. League 
President Lynitta Schaffer presented the group's recommendations to the council 
Tuesday night, urging officials "to set in motion the wheels of change." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert referred the matter to a council committee, a step league 
members supported. 
</P>
<P>
One key recommendation is to remove the charter provision for paying council 
members $100 a month. Instead, the league proposes that council salaries be set 
as part of the budget process each year. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert said Wednesday that she agrees with some league suggestions but not 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The current $100-a-month charter compensation for council members is too low to 
be realistic, Geissert said. But she disagrees with the league's proposal to 
limit council members to two consecutive four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
However, Geissert said, "it's not a bad idea to look at a basic document." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker found fault with several of the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a raise. I don't want to ask for a raise," Walker said. "You 
serve as an elected official because you like it." Walker, who has been on the 
council since 1979, said he also dislikes the two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
All council members have completed at least one term. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be reviewed by the council's Employee Relations and 
Department Organization Committee, chaired by Councilwoman Dee Hardison. No 
deadline for a decision was set. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-member Torrance league has recommended charter changes in the past, some 
of which have been adopted. Its current proposals grew out of a yearlong study 
of the charter, the basic document governing city operations. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the league asked for the appointment of a special committee 
including residents to examine the charter and recommend changes. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert said she is not ready to decide whether that sort of review is needed 
and will await a report from Hardison's group. Charter changes would have to be 
approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
The league report suggested that a charter review should pay special attention 
to the issues of council terms and compensation and the question of whether the 
city treasurer and city clerk should be appointed. The posts are now filled by 
election, and league members could not reach consensus on whether that should 
be changed, Schaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk John Bramhall said Wednesday that he favors the City Council 
appointing the clerk, just as it appoints the city manager and city attorney. 
City Treasurer Thomas C. Rupert was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The league agreed that specific pay amounts for council members should not be 
mentioned in the charter. Instead, council pay should be taken up as a budget 
item each year, Schaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
The current monthly pay of $100, stipulated in the charter, is misleading 
because it does not include the compensation that council members can receive 
from other accounts, league members said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, they are paid a flat automobile allowance of $410 a month and up 
to $250 for other expenses, Schaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffer also noted that because of fluctuations in the cost of living, any 
amount set in the charter can quickly become outdated. Some other sections of 
the charter are now outdated because of legislative changes, she told the 
council.

MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH AFTER ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man was shot to death, reportedly after arguing with his attacker 
early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a report of shots being fired in the vicinity of 29th Street and 
Imperial Avenue around 1:30 Wednesday morning," San Diego police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived at the intersection, they found the body of Billy C. 
Helton, 30, lying on the sidewalk, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police they had seen Helton arguing with another man minutes 
before the shooting, Robinson said. Witnesses heard shots and saw the other man 
drive away in a dark-color car, he said.

"Our loss is their gain," Parton told the 39-year-old administrator at the City 
Council's regular meeting. Councilwoman Barbara Doerr, who preceded Parton as 
mayor, said: "I'm real excited for you. . . . I think you've done a wonderful 
job for Redondo Beach, and you'll do a wonderful job for Laguna Niguel." 
</P>
<P>
Casey told the council that he "really struggled" with the decision to leave 
the city for which he has worked, in various capacities, for the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a truly wonderful professional and personal experience for me," 
Casey said. "We truly love Redondo Beach, and we'll miss you and the community 
very, very dearly." 
</P>
<P>
Casey was born in the South Bay and grew up in Palos Verdes Estates, where his 
widowed father still lives. He worked in the city manager's office in Ventura 
and Manhattan Beach before starting to work for Redondo Beach. He has held the 
city manager's post since 1981 and in recent years helped shepherd the city 
through the aftermath of the destruction of its landmark pier. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Casey said he is ready to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"In this profession, sometimes longevity can become more a liability than an 
asset, and after 18 years in city government -- 15 of them in Redondo Beach -- 
something inside was starting to tell me that perhaps it was time for a 
professional move," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When an executive search firm approached him about the opening in Laguna 
Niguel, he said, "I grabbed my family, did some homework on the community and 
submitted my resume." 
</P>
<P>
He was chosen from a field of about 100 applicants that was eventually whittled 
down to three finalists. 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, Casey earns $102,000 a year with a $3,600 annual car 
allowance. In Laguna Niguel, his salary will be only $99,600 a year, but his 
car allowance will rise to $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new city of 44,000 people, however, contrasts sharply with the 98-year-old 
community of Redondo Beach, where Casey had to work with a tax base and an 
array of public services that had been in place for decades. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Niguel, he said, "there are still opportunities to work with a 
community that's still going through major residential subdivision. It's not 
already all mapped out." 
</P>
<P>
Casey's successor will have to deal with a number of unfinished municipal 
chores, including the reconstruction of the pier, which was nearly demolished 
by a series of storms and a fire in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the wings, Casey said, are completion of the city's General Plan, which 
is undergoing its first comprehensive update since its adoption in 1964; 
renegotiation of the city's cable television franchise, which technically 
expired last year; development of Aviation Park, where the old Aviation High 
School once stood, and the need for a new city library and police headquarters.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY DEADLOCKS IN TRIAL OVER FIGHT WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury deadlocked Wednesday in the trial of a Sepulveda man, paralyzed from the 
waist down after he was shot by a police officer during a 1988 scuffle, who was 
accused of assault for his part in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Cardona is scheduled to return to San Fernando Superior Court on July 11 
to have a new trial date set. 
</P>
<P>
Cardona was shot as he scuffled with Los Angeles police officers outside his 
apartment at Columbus Avenue and Parthenia Place on March 23, 1988. Police, who 
were responding to a man-with-a-gun call, said Cardona grabbed for the 
officer's gun during the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Cardona is suing the Police Department for $10 million, alleging that the 
shooting was not justified. He has said he was not reaching for the gun at the 
time of the shooting.

NEW MUSCLE BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
FAMED VENICE SITE INSPIRES OUTDOOR GYM IN LONG BEACH

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high wind swept down on the beach near Belmont Pier late Monday afternoon. 
Flying clouds of sand whisked over the sleek oiled bodies of the handful of 
sunbathers staunch enough to brave the day. 
</P>
<P>
Yet near the Belmont Plaza Pool, a ferocious volleyball game was in full force. 
Joggers and bicyclers wended their way lazily along the strand. And wafting 
almost inaudibly in the breeze, the grunts and groans of muscled men mixed with 
the whistling wind to speak of something never seen here before: the city's 
first outdoor gym. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind is nice," said Matt Raith, 22, a Cal State Long Beach student with 
bulging biceps who said he had interrupted a jog along the beach to pick up a 
barbell. "You're outdoors, you're in the sun, the wind keeps you cool. And it 
gives you incentive when the girls walk by." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jody Burton, 29, one of the "girls" walking by: "This is great. It's like 
being in Venice. I like muscles." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Venice's famed Muscle Beach that inspired Dan Bode to create 
the equivalent in Long Beach. A former commercial real estate agent and 
longtime weightlifting enthusiast, Bode, 26, had worked out a couple of times 
at Muscle Beach but said he was uncomfortable with the facility's emphasis on 
competitive bodybuilding to the exclusion of weightlifting for general fitness. 
</P>
<P>
"I was intimidated by the huge bodybuilders," he said of sharing bench space 
with Venice's bulky contingent of musclemen. 
</P>
<P>
So earlier this week he opened his own Fit Beach Athletics, a gym with no walls 
where he hopes to make weightlifters and fitness buffs of all ilks feel 
welcome. Ironically, the bodybuilding arena in Venice was shut down this week 
to allow construction of a new and improved version. The revamped facility is 
scheduled to open by January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach facility, located on a 2,000-square-foot slab of concrete owned 
by the city next to the Belmont Plaza Pool, is surrounded by a chain-link fence 
protecting the thousands of pounds of weights within. Admission is $5 a day, 
$40 per month, or $99 for the entire summer. 
</P>
<P>
For the privilege of using city property, Bode said, he will pay Long Beach 
$3,000 or 3% of his summer gross, whichever is greater, as well as $300 a month 
for rent. 
</P>
<P>
City officials seem fond of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It will bring us a better clientele," said Dave Tedesco, city marine safety 
officer responsible for patrolling the area. While in the past, he said, the 
beach has been plagued by vagrants and gangs, the presence of the outdoor gym 
would tend to change that. 
</P>
<P>
"People coming down here to help themselves and get in shape are better than 
people down here to drink or hide or make trouble," Tedesco said. "The area 
needs something like this; it needs the focus." 
</P>
<P>
Bode said he plans to stay open seven days a week between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
from now through Sept. 30. When the weather turns cooler, he said, he will move 
the operation to warmer climes, perhaps Hawaii, Australia or Mexico. Then, if 
it is a success, he will return to Long Beach next summer. 
</P>
<P>
In order to break even, Bode said, he must attract at least 60 paying customers 
daily. During its first day of operation on Monday, he said, the facility drew 
about 20, all of whom were allowed to enter free as part of a special 
"get-acquainted" promotion. While the facility welcomes women, Bode said, its 
first-day clientele was all male. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest risk I've ever taken," said Bode, who has invested about 
$20,000 of his own and his family's money in the venture and left a full-time 
job in real estate to work at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the customers seemed happy with the result. 
</P>
<P>
"You can feel the seasons," said Mike Buono, 32, the owner of an auto repair 
shop who lives in Huntington Beach. "I don't like air conditioning; this is 
more natural and fun." 
</P>
<P>
Some passers-by, especially women, seemed to approve of the arrangement as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to look at," said Debra DeFranco, 27. "All the nice guys . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Amy Ward, a 21-year-old visitor from Philadelphia, even had an idea to 
contribute. "They should set up little stands," she suggested. "Guys always 
come to the beach to watch girls. It will be nice for girls to be able to come 
down and watch guys."

PANEL TO STUDY RELOCATION OF SKILLS CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA: THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW PLANS TO PUT THE CENTER ON A 
CITY-OWNED SITE IN A LARGELY RESIDENTIAL AREA.

Mayor Jess Hughston on Tuesday appointed a 10-person citizens committee to 
study a controversial proposal to build a permanent home for Pasadena City 
College's 22-year-old Community Skills Center at a city-owned site in East 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The skills center, which provides job training and English-language 
instruction, is now at McKinley Junior High school. The plan for its relocation 
will also be scrutinized by city staff members. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Directors voted 6 to 0 to consider the matter after hundreds of 
skills center supporters appeared at Tuesday night's board meeting, many 
wearing green buttons reading, "C.S.C. Just Say Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Hughston abstained, since he is an instructor at Pasadena City College, which 
plays a part in operating the center. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of people who live near the proposed site also showed up to 
protest having the skills center in their largely residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not object to the skills center; we do not object to the people who go 
to the skills center," said Pat Rowan, of the Daisy Villa Homeowners Assn. "But 
every time we say we don't want the traffic, we don't want the environmental 
impact, we are treated as if we are attacking motherhood." 
</P>
<P>
Rowan said more than 800 neighbors have signed petitions against the skills 
center, compared to only 118 residents who have signed petitions supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the homeowners' concerns, directors also instructed the 
committee and staff to investigate building homes on the 8.5-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The site, at 3000 East Orange Grove Blvd., lies underneath Southern California 
Edison power lines, east of Sierra Madre Boulevard. It is a narrow strip of 
land that stretches from Orange Grove south to Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for two 25,000-square-foot buildings on the site and a parking lot 
for up to 600 cars. A student cafeteria and a child development center would 
also be included. 
</P>
<P>
College officials said building costs have not yet been determined. They hope 
that state funds can be used to finance the construction. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 adults attend the skills center each year. "Literally thousands of 
lives have been changed," said Jack Scott, president of Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
The center is a joint project of the city, the college, which staffs and 
operates it, and the Pasadena Unified School District, which has provided a 
site for the last 10 years at McKinley Junior High at 325 S. Oak Knoll Ave. 
</P>
<P>
However, the district has informed college officials that it may soon reclaim 
the McKinley site for use as a middle school. 
</P>
<P>
City officials turned to the East Pasadena site because it is the only publicly 
owned piece of land that can accommodate the skills center, City Director 
Kathryn Nack said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been looking for eight years," Nack said. "Each (of the three 
agencies) has scoured their property and has not been able to come up with 
anything of that size." 
</P>
<P>
But resident Kenneth Moye said the skills center would create traffic problems, 
with up to 4,000 auto trips a day through the area. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said they feared that the skills center will need to expand in 
the future and that the residential land surrounding the site would be 
converted to parking lots and fast food restaurants to accommodate the 
students. Some complained that they would lose their back-yard view of open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
But after hearing their opposition, City Director John Crowley appeared to lose 
patience with the residents, saying, "I'm getting a little bit of a sense that 
you don't want any change at all." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition from neighborhood groups put a stop to previous city development 
plans for the site as an auto mall and a retail store. 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal will be studied until February, 1991, when final hearings 
are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Those appointed to the citizens committee are Robert Ahfeldt, Vincent 
DeStefano, Christopher Love, Lucille Lyon, Tom May, Michael McEvoy, Robert 
Monk, Kenneth Moye, Tim Price and John Takvorian.

SAVED FROM A LONG TREK TO SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
TOPANGA: PARENTS HAVE PERSUADED THE SCHOOL BOARD NOT TO ELIMINATE BUS SERVICE 
FOR THEIR TEEN-AGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Teen-agers in Topanga Canyon were saved from hiking down their long, winding 
road to school next year when a proposed cut of their bus service was vetoed by 
the Los Angeles Unified School District Board this week. 
</P>
<P>
The threatened action created a panic among canyon-dwellers, who are dependent 
on the buses to get their 179 junior and senior high school students to distant 
schools in Pacific Palisades, Brentwood and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
There are no secondary schools and no public transportation in the remote, 
rustic canyon between the ocean and the valley. Only one serpentine road, 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard, also known as California 27, leads in and out of its 
mountainous terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Joining a throng of speakers protesting budget cuts at Monday's marathon board 
session, Susan Petrulas Nissman pleaded with the board to reject the proposed 
cut as a severe hazard and hardship. 
</P>
<P>
"Boulevard is a misnomer," Nissman said. "It is not wide, nor is it inviting. 
It is a little, narrow two-lane highway with no shoulders, no sidewalks, no 
stop signs, no street lights, few turnouts, winding curves . . . and no 
crossing guards. . . . The security of our children is an issue we cannot 
ignore." 
</P>
<P>
Working parents, including single mothers, would be unable to leave work at 3 
p.m. to retrieve their offspring at the close of school, Nissman said. Instead, 
the teen-agers would be stranded and left to their own devices, which could 
include hitchhiking, bicycle riding on treacherous roads and hanging out at the 
beach, the closest they could get to home on public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Their victory at the board meeting, which lasted 11 hours, saved the parents 
from what they said would have been their next step: a protest march. As the 
mothers envisioned the march, teen-agers with parent chaperones would have set 
out to walk to school. Parents figured it would have taken two days, broken by 
an overnight camp-out at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Topanga teen-agers are among a small number -- 3,700 -- of Los Angeles 
Unified School District students whose bus ride to school is not connected to 
integration or overcrowding. Along with 25,000 others, they lost bus service in 
1980 as a cost-cutting measure, but service was restored in Topanga in 1983 
after parents persuaded the board of their unusual geographic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
They argued then and on Monday that a one-way trip to Grant High School in the 
valley, the nearest school for Topanga Canyon students, is nearly 20 miles. 
Most junior high students attend Parkman Junior High, also in the valley. Some 
of the students from the canyon attend Paul Revere Junior High in Brentwood, 
then go to Palisades High School, also a lengthy drive from home. 
</P>
<P>
Younger children attend Topanga Canyon Elementary School, which also serves 
about 15 students bused from an overcrowded valley school. 
</P>
<P>
The older Topanga students are part of what is left of the Home-to-School 
Transportation program, a $1.27-million item in the district's nearly 
$4-billion budget. To qualify, the students must face some danger, often a 
geographical hazard, on the walk to school. In Topanga Canyon's case, walking 
is impossible because of road conditions and the distances involved. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the program include children who otherwise would have to step over 
Skid Row dwellers lying in the street to get to class, and five students whose 
parents live and work at Terminal Island and would thus have to walk to school 
across the Vincent Thomas Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
To alleviate overcrowding and to integrate the schools, the district operates 
2,900 buses that crisscross the city, traveling 41 million miles a year, 
according to Bud Dunevant, district transportation director. 
</P>
<P>
Dunevant said the tiny home-to-school portion of the program is a frequent 
target for cuts because it is paid for out of the general fund. Most of the 
transportation budget comes from integration funds, which cannot be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to cut bus service for the Topanga students is "a stupid idea," 
said Westside board member Mark Slavkin outside the board room before Monday's 
vote. "Topanga Canyon is Topanga Canyon. It's way up there at the top of a 
mountain. You can't walk from the top of the canyon to (school)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After learning of the threat to their bus service last Friday from Slavkin's 
office, a group of mothers said they phoned as many families as they could 
reach, asking people to write letters of protest and attend the meeting. A 
handful waited out the long meeting for a turn to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should (school Supt. Leonard Britton) have a personal driver when our kids 
can't get a bus to school?" asked Connie Whalley, as she waited in the hall 
outside the board room. 
</P>
<P>
Whalley said she did not understand why the district didn't make the cuts in 
administration, rather than in programs affecting children: "A cut from the top 
is what is needed in this district." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy was repeated by many of the speakers at the public hearing 
Monday night, some of whom said they were begging the board not to gut their 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Argandona, an employee of the district child abuse office, pleaded with 
the board, "Please help us to continue to alleviate the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Budget cuts in the child abuse program cuts were vetoed by the board, as was a 
proposal to cut 131 security aides at the schools and to limit inter-district 
mail delivery to every other day. 
</P>
<P>
The board did, however, vote to save $981,318 by denying a raise to 111 top 
district administrators, who earn $75,000 or more. The district had recommended 
a 4.76% raise, rather than last year's 8%, for a savings of $397,500. On 
Slavkin's motion, the board narrowly voted to award the administrators no raise 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
The dwindling crowd in the audience burst into applause. 
</P>
<P>
By the meeting's close Monday night, well past 11 p.m., the board had trimmed 
$163 of the $221 million it needs to cut, district spokesman Pat Spencer said. 
About 17% or 18% of the cuts will come from the central administrative offices, 
long viewed as a top-heavy bureaucracy by school district critics. On Thursday, 
the board meets again to continue cutting expenses to meet the expected revenue 
for the next fiscal year.

NEW POLICE CHIEF TO FOCUS ON LOW MORALE; 
</P>
<P>
POMONA: LLOYD WOOD HOPES HIS HIRING HAS A SETTLING EFFECT ON THE DEPARTMENT, 
WHICH HASN'T HAD A PERMANENT LEADER FOR EIGHT MONTHS.

<P>
Lloyd Wood, selected this week to head the city's Police Department, says a top 
priority will be restoring the morale of officers who have been without a 
permanent chief for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, police chief in Azusa for the last nine years, will take command of the 
Pomona department July 16. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, with only three members present, approved Wood's appointment 
Monday, ending months of uncertainty in which council members criticized the 
department's leadership and briefly raised the possibility of contracting with 
the Sheriff's Department for law enforcement services. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, 50, said his appointment removes the uncertainty that has contributed to 
morale problems in the department. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the appointment will have a settling effect," he said. His first 
tasks will be to meet with employees individually and to learn about the 
community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he will move cautiously. "You can't make a whole lot of changes too 
quickly," he said, adding that when he went to Azusa nine years ago from the El 
Monte Police Department, where he had been a captain, he made some changes that 
turned out to be mistakes, and he had to reverse himself. "You have to get a 
feel for the community first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Camargo, president of the Pomona Police Officers Assn., said the council's 
decision to appoint Wood has already raised police morale and improved the 
relationship between the council and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Camargo said the council showed its concern for the department by hiring a 
chief who is highly regarded within the law enforcement profession, and has a 
reputation for honesty and fairness. He said Wood has the qualities "that will 
help turn the department around." 
</P>
<P>
Camargo said police morale plummeted when the council fired Police Chief 
Richard Tefank last October. Tefank's departure led the police association to 
endorse the recall of Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, a fierce critic of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant had urged the firing of two police officers with whom he had personal 
disputes. In addition, he and other council members criticized management 
tactics by the department's captains and lieutenants. Voters ousted Bryant at a 
recall election June 5, and council criticism of the department has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's removal cleared the way for the appointment of Wood, who was 
recommended by City Administrator Julio Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith and council members Tomas Ursua and Nell Soto voted to 
confirm Wood's appointment. Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer, who has been on 
vacation, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
In moving to Pomona from Azusa, Wood will be going from a department with 57 
sworn officers to one with 172. Wood said the challenge of a larger department 
and a larger city persuaded him to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
In Azusa, Wood did double duty as city administrator and police chief for three 
years. He stepped aside as administrator in 1987 to be replaced by Fuentes, who 
had been his assistant and who has since become Pomona's city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes urged Wood to apply for the chief's job in Pomona and has been 
advocating his appointment since February, when a panel of city managers and 
police chiefs from other Southern California cities recommended him over seven 
other finalists who were interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment was delayed for months by negotiations over a long-term 
employment contract, which Bryant strongly opposed and other council members 
had questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Wood dropped his demand for a contract and accepted the job at $82,932 a year, 
plus a car for his business and personal use, and credit for benefits he had 
accumulated in Azusa amounting to 14 days of sick leave, 10 days of vacation 
and 18 days of administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
He will accrue additional sick leave and vacation benefits on the job in 
Pomona.

ZEITSOFF WINS MALIBU COUNCIL SEAT BY 4 VOTES; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: VICTORY MAKES A CLEAN SWEEP FOR SLOW-GROWTH CANDIDATES IN THE FUTURE 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By a four-vote margin, slow-growth advocate Missy Zeitsoff has edged retired 
Judge John Merrick to claim the contested fifth seat on Malibu's future City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved it's finally over," Zeitsoff said, after Los Angeles County 
election officials this week proclaimed her the apparent winner. The outcome 
had been delayed until all the absentee and write-in ballots from the June 5 
incorporation election were counted. 
</P>
<P>
Zeitsoff's victory represents a clean sweep for slow-growth activists on the 
five-member council chosen by Malibu voters at the same time they 
overwhelmingly approved cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a state appeals court has indicated that it may, as early as this 
week, consider written opinions from lawyers for cityhood supporters and the 
county in the legal battle over when Malibu will be allowed to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are attempting to delay incorporation until next March in 
order to start work on a $43-million regional sewer system there before a new 
city government has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel in Los Angeles has set a hearing for July 18 to consider 
whether the county Board of Supervisors acted properly in imposing the 
incorporation delay when they obeyed a judge's order to stop stalling and set 
the cityhood election. However, the panel left open the possibility of allowing 
incorporation to go forward by late June or early July, pending the written 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Zeitsoff, 43, former secretary of the Malibu Township Council, a pro-cityhood 
group, called the election results "the best news I could have possibly had." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome ended nearly two weeks of suspense during which periodic updates of 
the vote count showed Zeitsoff's lead over Merrick had slipped from 21 votes to 
only one vote before the final results were announced. 
</P>
<P>
County election officials attributed the delay to the need to count absentee 
and write-in ballots separately and by hand. There were about 70,000 such 
ballots countywide, and officials said they had no way of immediately 
separating the Malibu ballots from the others. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the uncertainty caused by the delay, the 71-year-old Merrick 
suffered a mild stroke three days after the election. 
</P>
<P>
Merrick, who was hospitalized briefly and is said to be resting comfortably at 
home, was under a doctor's orders this week not to grant interviews or talk on 
the telephone, his wife, Marge, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," she said, upon learning that Zeitsoff had narrowly 
defeated her husband. "I voted for John, but it's no secret I was never 
enthusiastic about his running. And now, with (the stroke), I think it's time 
he concentrate on taking care of himself for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Zeitsoff is a retired schoolteacher and a single mother of four children. 
Besides her work on behalf of cityhood, she has been active in environmental 
issues. She was endorsed by the Sierra Club and the Los Angeles League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last 11 years, since my twins were born, I've not really had a career 
to call my own," she said. "I plan to put my energy into helping make sure 
that, as a new city, Malibu gets off to a sound start." 
</P>
<P>
Her victory gives Malibu Township Council representatives three of the five 
future City Council seats. Larry Wan was president of the group for two years 
before resigning to run for office, and Mike Caggiano has long been associated 
with the group. 
</P>
<P>
The other two council members, top vote-getter Walt Keller, and Carolyn Van 
Horn, co-chaired the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, another pro-cityhood 
group, before stepping down to enter the council race. 
</P>
<P>
The groups have frequently clashed, with MCI having taken a tougher stance in 
opposition to development of the seaside community. In their fight against 
county officials on behalf of cityhood, however, they have cooperated closely, 
and many of their rank-and-file members belong to both groups. 
</P>
<P>
Merrick entered the campaign as perhaps the best-known of the 30 candidates, 
having served as a Municipal Court judge in Malibu for 22 years before he 
retired in 1986. But with 84% of voters in favor of incorporation, he may have 
been hurt by his previous opposition to cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Merrick ran for the City Council in the failed 1964 attempt at incorporation 
and received enough votes to be elected had cityhood passed. At that time he 
opposed Malibu's incorporation, expressing concern about the way the boundaries 
were drawn and whether Malibu would be able to support itself financially. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers questioned his support for cityhood this time, even though he 
campaigned in favor of it. Of the 30 candidates, Merrick was the only one among 
the top nine vote-getters not affiliated with either of the two pro-cityhood 
groups.

RESIDENTS ENLIST MOLINA IN FIGHT FOR LOWER DENSITY 
</P>

<P>
Residents of Elysian Heights have asked the Los Angeles City Council to call a 
temporary halt to apartment and condominium construction in their hilly 
neighborhood northwest of Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
An informal group that recently defeated a proposal for 13 condominiums -- only 
to have the developer proceed with a plan to build eight apartments instead -- 
has submitted about 300 signatures to Councilwoman Gloria Molina asking for a 
downzoning review. 
</P>
<P>
The petition covers 29 specific blocks within the area bounded by Scott Avenue, 
Alvarado Street, Landa Street and Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
Those blocks were selected because they are zoned for greater density than now 
exists in the area of mostly older homes, said Valerie Tuna, leader of the 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Molina reacted favorably to the petition, spokeswoman Alma Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to introduce a motion in the City Council as early as Friday to place 
a temporary ban on multiple-family projects in the area and order a Planning 
Department review of its zoning, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The review would be aimed at establishing zoning "to reflect the existing 
community," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the councilwoman praised the community initiative as "a proactive way 
of dealing with overdevelopment." 
</P>
<P>
"If the residents are willing to downzone, that's usually what it takes," 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The area is part of the Echo Park/Silver Lake community plan adopted in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The petition said the area has "suffered major growth pressures in the 
intervening period and some inconsistent zones remain." 
</P>
<P>
Tuna organized the neighborhood group in response to the proposal of Seabreeze 
Development Co. to build condominiums on a steep parcel opposite Elysian Park. 
Under community pressure, the Planning Commission denied the builder's request 
for a variance to allow the condominiums. Instead, the firm has made plans to 
build an eight-unit apartment, which requires no variance, Tuna said.

RESIDENTS SEEK LIQUOR LICENSE DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents and an elementary school principal Tuesday urged a state judge to 
deny a liquor license to a businessman who wants to move his liquor store 
slightly closer to their south Glendale neighborhood, saying they fear litter 
and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Paul Hogan in Los Angeles, 
residents of the 400 block of West Colorado Street and the principal of Thomas 
Edison Elementary School protested a request by Sang Jong Cheun, owner of 
Colorado Liquor at 412 1/2 W. Colorado St., to have his liquor license renewed 
at a new location -- 470 W. Colorado St., about 475 feet to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Cheun wants to move his business because his current lease is not being 
renewed, a business associate testified Tuesday. Protesters said they hope that 
denial of a liquor license will move the liquor store out of the neighborhood 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
They said that despite the short distance involved, Cheun's move would add 
another liquor store to a half-block cluster that already has two convenience 
stores, a market, a drugstore and a restaurant that sell beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
Those businesses, as well as Cheun's store and others farther east on Colorado, 
have contributed litter and traffic to the already congested neighborhood, said 
Dorothy Myers, who lives across the street from Cheun's proposed location. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough trouble in the area already," said Myers, who submitted to the 
state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control a petition signed by 35 
residents opposing the move. 
</P>
<P>
The move also may encourage people to drink in nearby Pacific Park and threaten 
or give liquor to children who attend Edison, located about two blocks away on 
Lomita Avenue, said Myers and Edison Principal Mary Arevalo. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cheun nor his attorney could be reached for comment. But an ABC 
investigator testified Tuesday that Glendale police had no objections to the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC, which grants liquor licenses, in January denied Cheun's request 
because of the potential effect on residents, Edison Elementary and Pacific 
Park, said Mary Ann Presswood, an ABC attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan is expected to make a decision within 30 days but can only issue a 
recommendation, which means that even if he rules in favor of Cheun, the 
department can stand by its denial, Presswood said. If the department's final 
decision is unfavorable to Cheun, he can appeal to the department's appeals 
board or take the issue to court, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Myesook Cheun, Sang Jong Cheun's sister and a business associate, told Hogan 
that trash collection at the store's new location would be diligent and that 
the store would strictly enforce the age limit for purchasing liquor. 
</P>
<P>
But Arevalo told the judge that children walking to school would be endangered 
by the extra traffic and older students might be enticed to drink by the 
presence of an additional liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Reese, assistant director of Glendale's Parks and Recreation Department, 
testified against the request, saying the new location might increase litter 
and the number of people drinking in Pacific Park.

SUIT FILED OVER ORDER TO HIDE SATELLITE DISH; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL BATTLE: THE CITY SAYS THE RECEIVERS ARE VISUAL BLIGHT THAT MUST BE 
SCREENED. THE DISH'S OWNERS CONTEND THAT THE CITY HAS VIOLATED THEIR FIRST 
AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The owners of a religious television station, who have been ordered to relocate 
or hide a satellite dish located on the roof of their hillside home, have 
charged that Glendale's zoning law is unconstitutional in a lawsuit filed last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court suit was the latest development in a two-year legal battle 
between Glen and Beverly Chambers, owners of KAGL-TV Channel 30 in Glendale, 
and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities told the Chamberses in 1988 that the white satellite dish atop 
their two-story house in southeast Glendale violates zoning laws. Under a city 
ordinance, satellite dishes are considered visual blight and must be screened 
with fencing or vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
The couple contend that the city has violated their First Amendment rights, but 
officials say they are only trying to make the neighborhood more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamberses have refused to alter the dish atop their Oberlin Drive house, 
saying it is was installed before the city began regulating dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Further, they claim that the city is disregarding federal rules that forbid 
interference with dishes and is infringing on their right to free 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that Glendale's zoning law "on its face fails to have a 
reasonable and clearly defined health, safety or aesthetic objection, but in 
fact prevents reception of satellite-delivered signals on properties such as 
those of the plaintiffs within the city of Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
City zoning officials last year refused to grant the Chamberses a variance that 
would have allowed the dish to remain as it is. The Chamberses filed an appeal, 
but the Glendale City Council denied it in March. 
</P>
<P>
In their lawsuit, the Chamberses asked for unspecified punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not so much interested in money as the principle of the thing," said 
Gregg Eichler, the Chamberses' attorney. "What the suit has done is raise the 
propriety of what the city is doing. It's our position that the city is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials insist that they are on solid legal ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got lots of rules geared to the aesthetics of the community," said Kathy 
Marcus, Glendale's zoning administrator. "That's why we have a sign ordinance. 
That's why you don't have flashing lights in Glendale. All of these things are 
geared to eliminate visual clutter." 
</P>
<P>
When the city revised its zoning in 1986, it addressed the appearance of 
rooftop equipment, including satellite dishes and air-conditioning units. "The 
notion is that it would look better if there were screening," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
Eichler responded, "I frankly think this whole aesthetics issue is in the eye 
of the beholder. I think that satellite dishes, if they're properly mounted, 
are no worse than barbecue grills." 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale lawsuit is one of the latest of many legal squabbles nationwide, 
pitting satellite owners against local governments. "It is a problem and has 
been a problem for several years," said Mark C. Ellison, vice president and 
general counsel for the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The group estimates that 3 million U.S. households -- including 295,000 in 
California -- own satellite dishes. Ellison said the courts have consistently 
overruled cities that have tried to impose severe restrictions on dishes. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, we have not lost one of these cases yet on zoning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamberses declined to be interviewed about their dispute with Glendale. 
But in their 1989 variance application, they said they receive some of KAGL's 
programming via satellite and also need the dish to monitor their own evening 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's attorneys have said the unit was installed in 1981 -- well before 
the city's zoning rules mentioned satellite dishes -- and therefore should be 
allowed to remain. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials have argued that the dish is not entitled to protection from 
new laws because it was installed illegally without a city building permit, 
which is required for major construction on the roof of a home. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamberses' lawsuit describes the city's decision as "arbitrary and 
capricious," violating Federal Communications Commission's rules that take 
precedence over city laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The FCC has already determined that the reception of transmissions by 
satellite dish is something that people have a right to," Eichler said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the FCC ruled that city laws affecting satellite dishes must be based 
on "a reasonable and clearly defined health, safety or aesthetic objective." In 
addition, city laws cannot prevent reception of satellite-delivered signals or 
impose excessive costs on the dish owner. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kohl, a satellite communications specialist enlisted by the Chamberses, 
said the couple's dish will not pick up many signals if it is moved to the 
ground because it would be blocked by trees or the house. "You must have a 
physical line of sight, an unobstructed view of the satellite arc," Kohl said. 
"He had to get it on the roof to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
City planning officials said the Chamberses agreed last October to prepare 
proposals for partial screening of the rooftop dish. Instead, the planners 
said, the Chamberses sent letters from satellite communications experts, 
alleging that the city was violating FCC rules. 
</P>
<P>
Because the City Council has rejected the Chamberses' appeal, the city can 
prosecute the couple on misdemeanor charges, but officials said no such 
prosecution has been initiated.

CIVIC CENTER COMPLETION SET

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council's first meeting in the $100-million-plus Beverly Hills Civic 
Center is scheduled for Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
If construction proceeds as planned, the City Clerk's office would move from 
temporary quarters into the refurbished City Hall by the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
That move would be followed by the dismantling of the Police Department's 
temporary bungalows for its move into the new police headquarters, with the 
library transferring its operations on the weekend of Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled for the end of 1989, completion of the project was delayed 
by cost overruns and other problems that led to the resignation of longtime 
City Manager Ed Kreins early this year.

REPORT ON PREP SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A college prep school in Malibu for grades 7 through 12 would offer students an 
alternative to Santa Monica High School and could woo students from private 
schools, according to a preliminary report. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Malibu High School Study Committee found that many Malibu 
parents send their children to private schools rather than have them commute to 
Santa Monica High, the district's only high school. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least one-third of all Malibu children in kindergarten to 
eighth grade attend private schools, the committee estimates. As a result, 
enrollment at the district's Malibu Park School, which serves kindergarten 
through grade 8, has declined and has forced cuts in classes, according to the 
report, submitted to the school board this week. 
</P>
<P>
With some upgrading of the library and science labs, the middle school section 
of the 32-acre Malibu Park campus could serve grades 7 to 12, the report 
states. That part of the campus now has about 300 students but can accommodate 
about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed school, which would open in September, 1991, may not have as many 
electives and extracurricular activities as the 2,700-student Santa Monica 
High, but would offer a semi-rural and smaller setting, the report says. There 
should be no entrance requirements other than a willingness by students and 
parents to "commit to the level of effort required to achieve success in a 
rigorous academic program." 
</P>
<P>
A certain number of openings at the Malibu school would be set aside for 
students living in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Costs for the 1990-91 planning year are estimated at $82,100, which includes 
funds for recruiting minority students. Operational costs would be largely 
covered by increased state funding based on increased enrollment, the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which includes parents, students and educators, plans to submit 
its final report to the board July 9.

RISK MANAGEMENT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena spends more for risk management than other cities of comparable size, 
according to an audit prepared by Newport Beach consultants Warren, McVeigh 
&amp; Griffin Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The report, presented at Tuesday's Board of Directors meeting, attributed the 
higher costs to the diverse services offered by the city, including its own 
police helicopter fleet, electric power company and independent health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Pasadena pays $4.4 million annually for risk 
management, including workers' compensation, liability claims and insurance 
premiums. The consultants didn't list costs in comparable cities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the suggestions to reduce costs and improve the city's risk management 
were more safety training in the administrative services departments and 
development of a safety policy and manual for all city departments.

SALE OF HOUSING SITE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for the sale of city-owned property at 471 N. Los Robles Ave. and the 
construction of eight low- and moderate-income housing units on the site was 
approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel will be sold to Villa Los Robles Partners, which will spend $800,705 
to acquire the land and build the project in Northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will receive a $326,500 loan from the city's Community 
Development Commission. The corporation plans to obtain a conventional loan of 
$354,100 and to invest $120,105 of its own money in the project. 
</P>
<P>
City Director Chris Holden, concerned at the 30-year time period for paying 
back the city loan, asked that city staff members look into ways of speeding up 
repayment.

AID TO HOMELESS PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed its staff to look into ways of funding shelters 
for the homeless and to work with developers of a homeless project that has 
been stymied by city regulations. 
</P>
<P>
George Bosy, who with his business partner, Mike Damico, has converted the Four 
Aces Motel into a refuge for the homeless, asked the council to cut through red 
tape that he said is blocking plans to refurbish and install 10 mobile homes on 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy said 85 people, most of them formerly homeless, already are living at the 
motel and he would like to use the mobile homes to expand the program. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Bosy's plan violates city ordinances and would require an 
amendment to the General Plan, new zoning regulations and environmental 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy said he does not plan a full-scale mobile home park with all the amenities 
that the city would require, but instead is seeking permission to provide basic 
housing for homeless people while they get their lives back in order.

SCOUTS TO ATTEND CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood youngsters from low-income families will have a chance to attend 
Scout camp for a week this summer as part of a program sponsored by the 
Hollywood Sentinels Neighborhood Watch organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels, a crime watch group since 1988, sponsor a local Boy Scout and 
Girl Scout troop to provide area children with activities designed to keep them 
out of trouble and away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Both troops feature weekly meetings and monthly outings for all Scouts, who 
come from the DeLongpre Park area. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the Sentinels have planned two outings for the Scouts. The Boy 
Scouts will participate in a one-week session at the Los Angeles Council Boy 
Scouts' Lake Arrowhead camps. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts will participate in a one-week excursion 
to the Los Angeles Area Council's Cabrillo Beach Youth Waterfront Sports 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
To help offset the cost of sending children from low-income families, the 
Sentinels are having a rummage sale Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 
DeLongpre Park. From 1 to 2 p.m., the Los Angeles Jazz Society will present its 
Jazz Caravan Concert Series. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call Fares Wehbe at (213) 465-6503 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
weekdays.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: HIS DEDICATION . . . GAVE MILLIKEN A STATUS CLOSER TO THE 
MEDIEVAL ROLE OF TOWN CRIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They say "Red" Milliken was that rare kind of person whose death is a 
community's loss. They say that not because he was a person of high social 
standing, a tireless volunteer or a wealthy philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
William (Red) Milliken was the window washer of North Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
It was a position that he created himself shortly after the end of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
He held it through most of the '80s, which were also his 80s. 
</P>
<P>
His singular dedication to his calling, and to the community of his childhood, 
gave Milliken a status closer to the medieval role of town crier than any 
modern idea of what a window washer is. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, as Milliken made his rounds, he engaged those he met in opinionated 
conversation about the state of things in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been something in the paper or something he heard about, he would 
always have something to say about it, not necessarily good," recalled Diana 
Barnwell, who in the early 1980s worked in the storefront office of the 
Highland Park Improvement Assn., a city program to revitalize the business 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Barnwell got on the wrong side of Milliken's views. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt we were off in some sort of wrong direction," she said. "Because Red 
Milliken was Red Milliken, I didn't want to be disapproved of by him. I wanted 
his endorsement. I sought him out. I had to seek him out. It was his street. It 
was Red Milliken's street. The rest of us were allowed to be there." 
</P>
<P>
They made peace and now she has forgotten the specific point of contention. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly how people remember Milliken -- more for his force of personal 
character than a specific point of view. 
</P>
<P>
At Milliken's funeral the other day at the Little Church of the Flowers at 
Forest Lawn, a thoughtful eulogy was given by his nephew, James Milliken. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that his uncle graduated from Garvanza Elementary School and later 
Lincoln High School, supported his mother during the Depression, missed both 
world wars because of his age and had three enduring passions in life -- 
motorcycles, his wife Jane and Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
"On the Avenue, as he called it, was where Bill made his mark, both personally 
and on the community," his nephew said. "Rising every morning at 3:30 or 4 
a.m., he would be the first one out working on the Avenue. Over the years, he 
met, befriended or fought with almost all of the characters and straight 
citizens that passed his way. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The Avenue was a forum for him to develop and refine his own philosophy on 
life. He acted out in his real life what he stated he believed in. He was a 
major champion of the little guy. His views in life reflected his deep belief 
in the importance of honesty, integrity and human kindness." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I failed to notice Milliken back in the 1960s when I spent many a 
listless hour waiting with other young men in Lou's barbershop. Milliken would 
have been in his 60s already, and not the kind of presence an adolescent would 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
I missed him again as a reporter checking in on Highland Park's travails, such 
as stationery store owner Bill Warren's efforts to keep the Highland Park 
Symphony alive. Contemporary reporting has pretty much replaced the old way of 
hanging out on the streets with something more akin to high-altitude pinpoint 
bombing and, in consequence, often misses the nuances of a community's social 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
I was able to learn more about Milliken, finally, from Danny Howard, my 
cross-country teammate at Franklin High School in 1961. Howard stuck close to 
his roots all these years. He lives in Eagle Rock and writes historical books. 
</P>
<P>
He's just completed one for Highland Park realtor Donna Harnsberger. It's 
called, unblushingly, "Harnsberger and the Winners Presents a History of 
Highland Park, Mount Washington and the Harnsbergers." 
</P>
<P>
Howard interviewed Milliken twice and found room in his book for anecdotes such 
as this: 
</P>
<P>
"Led by Red Milliken, local youngsters Buster McCoy, Louie Burgermeier and Bill 
Cannell would all ride their bicycles over the Pacific Electric bridge over the 
Arroyo Seco in the early 1900s, making sure to avoid any oncoming trolley 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from making mischief, Milliken also mowed lawns in the neighborhood and 
sold the clippings to chicken farmers for 5 cents a gunnysack, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
I've also learned that Pat Samson of the Highland Park Heritage Trust 
interviewed Milliken on video for the organization's 30-minute documentary, "On 
the Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Along with lore about the swimming hole in the arroyo and about moving 
Anderson's card store seven times, it shows his contentious nature. 
</P>
<P>
"He just had strong opinions about the people in charge being too big for their 
britches," Samson said. 
</P>
<P>
I regret having never met Milliken. 
</P>
<P>
And I think that his loss is more than Highland Park's alone. 
</P>
<P>
The world needs people who measure their turf by how far their feet will carry 
them and make it better by force of personal character.

CONSULTANT TO SURVEY VOTER STANCE ON BOND OR TAX VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ABC Unified School District board has approved the hiring of a consultant 
firm to determine voter support for a bond or tax override for the 
20,000-student system. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to hire Price Research Consultants of San Ramon for $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
The firm will conduct a six- to eight-month survey to determine if there is 
sufficient voter support for a bond or parcel tax. 
</P>
<P>
If there is support, the district would ask for a special election early next 
year, Supt. Larry Lucas said. Lucas said the survey is the first stage in 
determining "the community's willingness and ability to provide funding beyond 
the state's support." 
</P>
<P>
The district is facing an estimated $2.5 million in cuts from its 1991-92 
budget and must find ways to finance school programs and capital improvement 
projects, he said.

Sanctions will range from $100 to $500 in fines and the possible revocation of 
a violator's business license. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions will include food items packaged outside the city or purchased 
through a contract entered before the effective date of the ban. One-year 
exemptions will be considered for distributors who cannot immediately meet the

SERVICE ASSESSMENTS SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has set fiscal year 1990-91 assessments for the city's 
Lighting and Open Space Maintenance District, which provides the services to 
5,668 properties in nine zones. 
</P>
<P>
The annual assessments range from $67 to more than $550 per lot, depending on 
the number of lots in a development and the amount of landscaping in each zone. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing last week, some residents complained that the 
assessments should be spread more evenly among the city's property owners. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no consistency in this city as far as taxation is concerned," said 
Judy Uribe, who lives in the residential zone with the highest average 
assessments. "It's totally ridiculous that some people are paying $1,000 per 
year and others are paying only pennies." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a city-appointed committee studied various proposals to 
redistribute assessments but found that Walnut's burgeoning development 
thwarted a consistent plan.

RECREATION CENTER TO GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westchester Recreation Center will be expanded to include a center for 
teen-agers and a picnic area under a plan approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to allow the Department of Transportation to donate nearly 1 
1/2 acres of vacant land adjacent to the center for the new facilities and the 
widening of a small stretch of Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials had intended to use the land, valued at $675,000, for 
a service yard. But they recently decided the yard was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan for the property, the Department of Recreation and Parks 
will provide staffing for youth programs at the enlarged facility. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a significant dearth of recreational land in Westchester and along 
with that a dearth of organized activities," said Rick Ruiz, spokesman for 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents Westchester. "To the degree you can 
keep teen-agers busy, you can keep them out of trouble."

COMMUNITY DIGEST : LONG BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS PLEASED WITH 7% DROP IN WATER USE IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach water use declined in May by 7% from the previous year, cheering 
Water Department officials who have urged residents to cut back on their water 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"This overall just shows people are consistently saving as opposed to last 
year," said Bob Cole, assistant general manager of the Long Beach Water 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The response has been great." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the call for voluntary conservation efforts went out last month, 
local water customers were cutting back, according to Water Department figures, 
which show that April use was 8% below the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The department gets 60% of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California, which is trying to conserve water in the fourth year of a 
statewide drought. The remaining 40% comes from local ground water wells, which 
have remained at adequate levels, Cole said.

CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council gave preliminary approval to an ordinance to make campaign 
contribution limits conform with those of the state, repealing a measure that 
was stricter than state law. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday night vote was unanimous on the ordinance, which will require a 
second vote before it becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to be considered at the July 2 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the previous ordinance, adopted in January, individual contributions were 
limited to $250. The state limit is $1,000. Political action committees may 
contribute up to $2,500 to a candidate under the new measure, as opposed to 
$500 under the earlier one. And so-called broad-based political committees, or 
those that get contributions from 100 or more people, may make campaign 
contributions up to $5,000 -- $4,000 more than allowed in the previous 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"This way we'll be uniform with the state and the bookkeeping and paper work 
will be a lot easier," said Mayor Eugene Moses. "The limits set by the state 
are very fair."

PROJECT EXEMPT FROM BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors on Tuesday told One Colorado developer Douglas Stitzel 
that he does not need to put up a "completion bond" on the $70-million retail 
project in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel had asked the board to exempt him from the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, William Cathey, told the board that the general contractor, C. L. 
Peck/Jones Brothers Construction Corp., already requires that all its 
subcontractors be bonded. 
</P>
<P>
City Directors John Crowley and Rick Cole reminded Cathey that the requirement 
was made in order to guarantee that once work began on the project it would be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
But Cathey said Stitzel has every intention of completing the job, and will 
secure construction financing within the next two weeks to cover the cost of 
building the project.

SMOKING BAN COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Dominic S. Polimeni has agreed to work with merchants on a 
compromise to his proposed anti-smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Polimeni had suggested that smoking be banned in restaurants with 40 or fewer 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended that larger dining establishments set aside half of their 
seating for nonsmokers. In addition, he suggested an outright ban on smoking in 
public places and city-owned vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
But Polimeni's proposal drew criticism at Tuesday's council meeting. San 
Gabriel Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Judy Brown said she was 
concerned that the group's members did not know about the proposal and had no 
opportunity to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to overreact," Brown said Wednesday. "Let's clearly study 
this and see what are the potential effects." 
</P>
<P>
The council took no formal vote, but members suggested that Polimeni take the 
next six weeks to work with the business community and resubmit an ordinance 
Aug. 7.

POPULAR PUB TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former Loch Ness Monster Pub, an Old Pasadena counterculture institution 
closed for the past three months, will reopen Friday under a new name, 
according to the new owners, Martita Titus and Art Jong. 
</P>
<P>
The bar, renamed the Old Pasadena Pub, was to have opened last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But fire inspectors paid a surprise visit and ordered a number of violations 
corrected, including widening the hallway, installing panic doors on the exits 
and repositioning a wrought iron gate to swing in the opposite direction, Titus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pub's previous owners, who closed up shop three months ago in a rent 
dispute with the building's owner, could not be reached for comment. Jong said 
the old owners have told him they plan to reopen elsewhere in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Titus promises the Old Pasadena Pub will offer the same ambience -- darts, 
dancing and music by Snotty Scotty and The Hankies -- that made the Loch Ness a 
local legend at the corner of Union Street and Fair Oaks Avenue.

GLENDALE COUNCIL TO HOLD AUG. 28 PUBLIC HEARING ON MULTIFAMILY ZONING CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday set an Aug. 28 hearing to obtain final 
public comment on a turbulent two-year revision of the city's multiple-family 
zoning in an effort to slow population growth. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will occur about two months before the expiration of a moratorium 
on construction of apartments and condominiums in Glendale, first imposed by 
the council in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting very close to some kind of conclusion on this downzoning and a 
plan that will help us keep the population within limits," Councilman Jerold 
Milner said. "We're almost to the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Because of summer vacations and work that must be completed by city planners, 
the council set Aug. 28 for a public hearing on the revised development rules. 
A vote would likely take place within a few weeks of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when we hope to have the whole package brought to us," Milner said. 
"The end result, we hope, will be a managed growth program for the next 10 to 
15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Council members have said they want to permit no more than about 10,000 new 
housing units, limiting Glendale's maximum population to about 240,000. 
</P>
<P>
Downzoning would change city planning rules, permitting fewer housing units 
than are now allowed to be built on a lot. The tactic has sparked criticism 
from some property owners, who complained that downzoning would dramatically 
reduce the value of their land. 
</P>
<P>
The council has tentatively endorsed a plan to cut in half the number of new 
units that can be built on 63% of the land zoned for multiple-family housing. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 37% has been divided into 25 areas in which the council wants to 
tailor the zoning rules to the character of the neighborhood. The council has 
tentatively approved plans to allow more apartments in some of these areas, 
while limiting other areas to single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, the city staff must prepare a "building cap" ordinance 
that would limit the number of new housing units that could be built each year. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have expressed concern that some apartment owners would allow 
their buildings to deteriorate, rather than rebuild the smaller, less 
profitable complexes allowed after downzoning. Before the Aug. 28 hearing, city 
staff members are expected to prepare options that would encourage the 
rebuilding of older apartment complexes.

VERDUGO CENTER HELPS YOUNGSTERS VAULT INTO COMPETITION WITH SOLID EDUCATION IN 
GYMNASTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nondescript concrete building sits hard by unused railroad tracks that 
separate it from a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this highly unglamorous setting, at the end of a cul de sac and 
flanked by industrial warehouses and garages at the Glendale-Los Angeles 
border, that the Verdugo Gymnastics Center inconspicuously attends to the 
business of producing and refining athletic skills. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters who roll into the 6,500-square-foot building for instruction 
tumble out with a first-rate gymnastics education. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I walked in here for the first time, I thought, 'This is real 
gymnastics,' " said David Hesbon, 32, a coach at the center who is a nationally 
rated judge and a former member of the U. S. National Junior Team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not just doing forward and backward rolls in here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, more than 200 athletes test and extend their limits under the watchful 
eyes of an experienced staff. 
</P>
<P>
Flags and ropes hang from the ceiling and mats cover the floor. One wall is 
mirrored and others are adorned with posters showing world-renowned gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
From an upstairs area overlooking the main floor, parents and other spectators 
can watch the gymnasts practice their routines. 
</P>
<P>
During peak hours, the center is a flurry of tumbling and twisting activity. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 100 students will be practicing at a time, rotating from station to 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no events (apparatus) empty," Hesbon said. "If something is 
abandoned, it's only that way for about a minute until someone else snatches it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1973, the center has been designated by the United States Gymnastics 
Federation as a national training center -- one of only three in Southern 
California and the only one in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Classes are offered for aspiring gymnasts of all levels, from toddlers to 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to provide a safe environment for people to learn," said Brenda 
Browning, 27, a coach and the center's managing director. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools aren't doing as much physical fitness as they used to. This gives kids 
a place to develop friendships and get physically fit." 
</P>
<P>
Kindernastics are offered to help children ages 22 months to 4 1/2 years 
develop body awareness, coordination, rhythm and perceptual motor skills. 
</P>
<P>
Beginner and intermediate classes incorporate an introduction to the various 
events of men's and women's competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Introductory, intermediate and advanced teams compete in local, regional and 
national competitions. 
</P>
<P>
The center draws gymnasts from throughout the region because it is home to one 
of the few women's Elite teams in Southern California. Athletes at the Elite 
level practice the Olympic compulsory routines in hopes of qualifying for a 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
The center was home to former U. S. National Team member Cyndi Tom and former 
U. S. Junior National Team member Eugenia Park. 
</P>
<P>
Current Elite athletes at Verdugo include Laurie Bartelt, 14, of Alhambra; 
Sirinda Sincharoen, 16, of La Canada; Londa Chun, 16, of Woodland Hills; Amy 
Nishiyama, 13, of Los Feliz; and Rebecca Jones, 16, of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"When you deal with kids in class, you have kids that are here just for an 
experience, not to be Mary Lou Retton," Hesbon said. "They're here because 
doctors say gymnastics would be really good for this child's coordination, 
self-esteem, self-confidence and overcoming fears. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into your team aspect, you want to make your athletes as good as 
they possibly can be. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not here for Park and Recreation games. They're here to do well and to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
For the past nine years, the Verdugo center has augmented the overall 
gymnastics experience by hosting an international competition at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Next March, teams from Japan, Ireland, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and 
the Soviet Union are expected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, such a competition would take place at the Verdugo center but the 
facility is too small to host so many athletes. Browning said the nonprofit 
group is hunting for a larger home in the Glendale area. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, a bigger center would be useful not only for once-a-year 
international meets. More room would mean more space for students on a daily 
basis, providing an opportunity to expose more children to gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty amazing to see what some of the kids who come here can do after 
working so hard," Hesbon said. "But there's something for everyone in 
gymnastics, whether it's being able to do a double-back or learning how to 
improve your balance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun and something everyone should try."

LONGTIME HOOVER COACH KOHLMEIER SET TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorence "Dee" Kohlmeier, golf coach and athletic director at Hoover High, will 
retire Friday after 36 years with the school. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlmeier, 70, taught for five years in Indiana before coming to Hoover in 
1953. He coached basketball for five years -- guiding his team to the 
semifinals of the Southern Section large-school division tournament in 1957 -- 
before assuming the role of athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlmeier, who has taught physiology, life science, health and safety, and 
physical education, started the Hoover golf program in 1959. He coached the 
team for 10 years, took a five-year break, and returned for the past 16 
seasons, guiding the Tornadoes to the last two Pacific League championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured after 41 years, that was enough," Kohlmeier said. "I started 
thinking about it at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of the year, I started having trouble with my shoulder. Little 
things told me, 'Hey, it's time to start letting some younger people take it 
over.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Henderson will replace Kohlmeier as golf coach. Randy Tiffany will 
become the boys' athletic director and Judy Thomsen will be the girls' athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlmeier said he has many fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
"To watch the (Southern Section) teams, the Joe Hillmans, the team that made it 
to the Final Four in 1957 -- seeing those kids come through and seeing them 
later is always a joy," Kohlmeier said. "Those are the memories you really 
appreciate. Just watching kids grow up." 
</P>
<P>
A golf tournament honoring Kohlmeier will be held June 28 at the Verdugo Hills 
Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
New coach: Jim Delzell will become interim coach of the Hoover baseball 
program, replacing Bob Cooper, who is taking a one-year sabbatical after 15 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Delzell, 31, coached the Hoover junior varsity last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a shot, so we'll see what happens," said Delzell, who inherits a 
team that was 6-9 in the Pacific League. "We've got our top two pitchers back 
and a lot of good kids from our sophomore team." 
</P>
<P>
Signed, sealed, delivered: Former Crescenta Valley baseball player Mike 
Muhlethaler has signed a contract with the Oakland Athletics and is playing for 
the organization's Medford, Ore., affiliate in the Northwest League, a Class-A 
short-season league. 
</P>
<P>
Muhlethaler, who plays infield and outfield, was selected by Oakland in the 
34th round of the amateur draft. This season, he struggled with various 
injuries and batted .317 with seven home runs and 30 runs batted in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
Fast finish: Tom Kendall of La Canada finished fourth last Saturday in the 
Motor City 100 SCCA Trans-Am race at the Valvoline Detroit Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, driving a Chevrolet Beretta, started on the pole after setting a 
course record Friday on the 2.5-mile temporary street circuit, qualifying at 
77.603 m.p.h. He topped the time of 1 minute 57.029 seconds, set in 1989 by 
series champion Dorsey Schroeder, by 1.055 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Raising a racquet: Bruce Man-Son-Hing of Glendale will compete in the finals of 
the Southern California Public Parks tennis tournament. Man-Son-Hing advanced 
last weekend by defeating Donny Issak of Los Angeles, 6-3, 6-0, in the 
semifinals.

LANDLORDS AGREE TO 4-MONTH PLAN TO REPAIR RUN-DOWN APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two landlords accused of allowing slum conditions in a downtown Glendale 
apartment building have agreed to clean up the complex within four months under 
an agreement reached with prosecutors last week. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Braden agreed to drop 16 of 17 misdemeanor charges 
filed in May against Richard Famiglietti of Reseda and Allen Lazarus of Los 
Angeles if they repair their 14-unit building at 130 N. Jackson St. by 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the two-story, 63-year-old building is repaired, Braden said, he 
will require each of the landlords to plead guilty or no contest to a single 
criminal charge and face a $250 fine and three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want these particular landlords simply to go back and do what they 
were doing without the risk of having their probation revoked and probably 
going to jail," he said. "It's a way of making them understand the seriousness 
of the situation and a kind of leverage for us." 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges -- including failure to provide hot and cold running water 
and heat, repair broken windows, walls and plumbing and prevent rat and 
cockroach infestation -- were filed after city officials, as a result of 
tenants' complaints, inspected the building. Each charge carries a potential 
$500 fine and six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found gaping holes in ceilings and walls, torn and soiled carpet and 
broken faucets and windows in the apartments, Braden said. The landlords and 
tenants have blamed each other for the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Famiglietti and Lazarus last Thursday pleaded not guilty to the charges in 
Glendale Municipal Court. A pretrial hearing has been set for July 12. 
</P>
<P>
Famiglietti, a real estate agent who owns six other apartment buildings in the 
San Fernando Valley, said repairs, which may cost up to $15,000, are under way 
at the building. City inspectors will periodically monitor the work, Braden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a disgrace," Famiglietti said. "I didn't realize there was that kind of 
damage in the apartments, and I understand why the city cited us for it." 
</P>
<P>
But Famiglietti said he was unsure whether he would plead to a single 
misdemeanor charge, as required by Braden. He maintained that some of the 
tenants are day laborers who have crowded fellow workers into their apartments 
and caused much of the damage. He blamed other problems on former managers. 
</P>
<P>
Several day laborers living in a second-floor apartment have been evicted, and 
several more in another unit soon will be evicted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There really are a lot of problems in that building, but it isn't because we 
didn't want to fix them," Famiglietti said. "There were six or eight guys 
living in one single apartment. We weren't going to repair it until the guys 
were out. Now we have the problem in hand."

Plant a tree this summer to shade the hot spot in your garden next year. 
</P>
<P>
It's not necessary to sacrifice having a vegetable garden to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
Use drip irrigation instead. There's less water wasted and the water is 
distributed more evenly. Using mulch also helps the soil retain moisture and 
discourages weeds. Not only does that cut down on the time you spend 
maintaining the garden, but weeds consume water and nutrients meant for your 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The late-summer productivity of your roses is determined by the amount of water 
and feeding they receive now. The rose garden should never be allowed to dry 
out. You can maintain steady growth through regular watering and feeding. 
Protect new growth from pests by spraying at pre-determined intervals. 
</P>
<P>
One last planting of dahlia tubers will give you fall blooms as the plants you 
set out earlier are cutting back. 
</P>
<P>
It's not too late to plant tomatoes. Set them deeper in the ground than they 
were in the nursery container to prevent weak, leggy plants. 
</P>
<P>
Dig basins that slope away from the trunks of shrubs and trees. Fill the basins 
and allow the water to penetrate deep into the root zone. 
</P>
<P>
Tuberous begonias in pots, beds or hanging baskets should be fertilized on a 
regular basis throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Soak hanging basket plants under a sprinkler or in a tub every now and then to 
ensure roots are getting thoroughly irrigated.

MARSHALLESE SEEK COSTA MESA CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Orange County will probably get its first consulate in about a year, and the 
event may do more for geographical literacy than a dozen PBS travelogues. 
</P>
<P>
Got your atlas ready? Look up the Marshall Islands (hint: between Hawaii and 
Guam). It's a collection of 29 atolls and 1,225 tiny islands with a land mass 
of about 70 square miles in the central Pacific, home to approximately 43,300 
Marshallese. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the homeland of about 375 expatriate Marshallese who live in or near 
Costa Mesa and compose the largest concentration of Marshall Islands natives in 
the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
The local Marshallese came to Orange County over the last 15 years mainly to go 
to college, and most have stayed on. But their ties to the islands and island 
culture -- and to each other -- remain strong. They get together frequently for 
meetings, parties, dances, cultural events, birthdays, anniversaries, weddings 
-- almost any excuse for a bit of socializing with the home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
So when the idea for a centralized Marshall Islands cultural center in the 
Costa Mesa area came up about a year ago, it quickly reached the ears of the 
Marshallese government and Marshall Islands President Amata Kabua. And the idea 
for a second use of the center began to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrival of the Marshallese, Orange County has been considered a kind 
of cultural and economic touchstone, a link between the islands and the United 
States. Because of these ties, said Kabua, the cultural center seemed the 
perfect place to establish a consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very appealing to us," said Kabua during a visit to Orange County early 
this month. "It's gratifying to know that we have friends here who can assist 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Kabua and his minister of foreign affairs, Tom Kijiner, made a stop in Orange 
County on the way to Washington, D.C., to dedicate the new Marshall Islands 
embassy there. Kijiner said the consulate, like the embassy in the U.S. 
capital, is expected to give the Marshall Islands greater visibility and higher 
recognition among Americans, particularly American business people and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dream," said Kijiner, "and it's been a dream for a while now. We 
need more of these consulates in the United States to take care of our people 
and to get business activities going between the people back home and United 
States companies. We are looking to the future, and we see that the western 
part of the United States, with the (business) development of the Pacific Rim, 
will be the center of the country as far as we're concerned. We're looking at 
both sides of things, the cultural and the economic." 
</P>
<P>
The cultural center/consulate would be built on land in a county corridor off 
Bristol Street that is owned by Jerry Barto, a real estate developer from 
Newport Beach. A financing plan has not been worked out yet, said Barto, but a 
likely option would be joint funding by the local Marshallese community (to 
cover the expenses associated with the parts of the project used for a cultural 
center) and the Marshall Islands government (to cover the consulate offices). 
</P>
<P>
The proposed two-story structure would include meeting areas and a stage on the 
first floor to accommodate approximately 400 people, as well as Marshallese 
dance and musical groups. Upstairs would be offices for use by both the local 
Marshallese club, called Jake Jabol Eo, and consular officials. 
</P>
<P>
The center still is not a sure thing, but Kijiner said that "things seem to 
have fallen into place. I'm very optimistic that it will happen."

FAMILY LIFE: TODAY'S CHILDREN SHOULD BE SEEN -- AND AT THE VERY LEAST, HEARD 
FROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I hate to sound old-fashioned, but I like to know where my kid is -- all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
I say old-fashioned because, judging by my 12-year-old's friends, it's a pretty 
outdated notion. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure their parents ever know where they are, how long they're staying 
or, indeed, if they plan to come home at all. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, for example, my son asked if So-and-So (not his real name) 
could spend a couple of days with us because his mother was going to be out of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
I had no problem with that and expected I would hear from the mother, whom I've 
never met, before the date to get whatever particulars were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
This past Friday, So-and-So showed up on his bicycle with a few changes of 
clothing in his book bag. His mother had left that morning and would be back 
late Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, no, he did not know where she was going, other than somewhere out of 
state. He was sure she didn't have my phone number because he didn't know it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I would never leave my son with anyone I didn't know pretty well. And I 
certainly would leave a number where I could be reached in an emergency, along 
with the name and number of our family doctor and mention of the fact that I 
have emergency treatment authorizations on file at two local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
And at some point during the weekend I would call to make sure everything was 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we never heard a word and I took our guest home Sunday evening to a dark 
house, where I reluctantly left him with a promise to call if he needed 
anything or if his mother didn't get back. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, this is an extreme case of the kind of apparent lack of interest I 
see all the time, in my neighborhood and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't count the number of times kids have told me it wasn't necessary to 
call their folks to get permission to stay for any reason, from having dinner 
to going to a movie. 
</P>
<P>
They're always right, but I make them check anyway, although I'm not sure why. 
</P>
<P>
If you doubt there's any basis for my concern or my belief that the problem is 
growing, ask any teacher at just about any grade level about parent 
participation -- in anything other than voting against school bonds, that is. 
</P>
<P>
If 20% of the parents come to a school open house, it's considered a good 
crowd. And the overwhelming majority of invitations for parent-teacher 
conferences go ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"Even warning notes threatening a failing grade -- or even expulsion -- are 
often unanswered," one teacher told me. "It terrifies me that these kids are 
just being cut loose. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact is that many of them are on their own at this age (12) and 
sometimes even earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The whole matter reminds me of a shocking discovery made by the late historian 
Barbara Tuchman while she was researching what was to become her award-winning 
book on the 14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
It struck her at some point that, other than the Christ child, she found 
virtually no mention of children in any of the period's art and literature -- 
other than heirs to a throne -- no portraits, no histories. 
</P>
<P>
One reason, she decided, was that so few children lived to adulthood (which, 
incidentally was at about the age of 9) that parents were afraid to get 
attached to them. 
</P>
<P>
Another was that the parents were so involved in self-survival that they didn't 
pay much attention to children, especially if they weren't directly 
contributing to the family larder. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, kids simply didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
And the point of the book was how closely our society today matches that of the 
14th Century -- hence the title, "A Distant Mirror." 
</P>
<P>
When I first read the book several years ago, I found Mrs. Tuchman's thesis a 
little far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm not so sure.

WESTERN WINGDING HELPS TRAUMA SOCIETY HIT PAY DIRT; 
</P>
<P>
HUGS, HANDSHAKES AS 800 ATTEND 
</P>

The Goldrush Camp at Knott's Berry Farm was the site of an Orange County Trauma 
Society fund-raiser on Friday -- the fourth annual Western-themed wingding 
hosted by the Associates, a support group founded and chaired by Virginia Knott 
Bender. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800 guests paid $75 each to mosey down the park paths to the tented 
private party camp. The event raised an estimated $50,000 for accident 
prevention and various educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming guests were Bender, her husband, Paul, Associates president Peggy 
Goldwater Clay and OCTS founder Dr. John West. 
</P>
<P>
After hugs and handshakes and backslaps -- you get to know your pardners pretty 
well by the fourth benefit -- guests lit out for the hosted bars and the 
big-as-a-barnyard open air dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Local rhinestone cowboys and cowgirls donned buffed boots, fringed jackets, 
string ties and Stetsons -- as well as enough acid-washed blue jean material to 
stretch from here to the Texas panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
Janet and John Fossum enlisted about 60 summer clerks and attorneys from the 
Newport Beach law firm where John works. 
</P>
<P>
"Ginny and Paul (Bender) are longtime clients, so we like to be part of this," 
Fossum said. "And it's just a good party, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
They knew out on the dance floor, where Don Thompson and Barbara Henry kicked 
up their heels with Barbara Towne and Norm Fast -- the first foursome out there 
two-steppin' and side-steppin' and generally looking like they knew what they 
were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne and Michael Keele got in on one of the line dances, as did Patty and Bob 
George. Among the throng on the ever-widening sidelines were Jim Shaw and Susan 
Barlow, who wore a gold-fringed leather jacket that looked like a cross between 
Hells Angels duds and Annie Oakley gear. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Harlan, a Newport Beach lawyer and president of OCTS, pushed his white 
cowboy hat back on his head and said that trauma care in the county suffered a 
blow earlier this year when one of the four trauma centers closed because of 
lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're focusing on getting more community interest" and raising 
money, he said. The group is developing a new fund-raising program to attract 
corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
At sundown, guests lined up for a buffet fried-chicken dinner and a slice of 
boysenberry pie. Then it was back to the dance floor or off into the wilds of 
the amusement park.

COSTA MESA POLICY COULD SPUR EASING OF INS LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Calling a Costa Mesa funding policy concerning aliens "a blessing in disguise . 
. . because it alerted everybody to the absurdity" of immigration restrictions, 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp told city officials and 
national Latino rights advocates Wednesday that he will ask Congress to amend 
provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp called a meeting with officials from Orange County to talk about the 
national implications of the Costa Mesa policy. Later, as he was leaving to 
brief White House officials, Kemp said he believes President Bush shares his 
concern over what the secretary considers inequities in the way the federal 
government provides aid to immigrants, both legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration is committed to making sure that laws are not applied 
in such a way that they are discriminatory -- and the way immigration laws are 
currently working, there is blatant discrimination," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House issued no statements about Kemp's meeting or whether the 
President will support attempts to modify current immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa policy -- adopted last August and subsequently rescinded -- 
would have denied federal grants administered by the city to public service 
groups unless they agreed to exclude illegal aliens from their programs. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said that he expects wide support for easing immigration restrictions 
"once people get a sense of how counter-productive and counter-intuitive the 
laws are in their treatment of people." 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is fashion a ruling that lets the (Immigration and 
Naturalization Service) be responsible for borders . . . and does not require 
that social service groups be agents of the federal government," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kemp suspended a ruling issued by his general counsel that supported 
the Costa Mesa policy. The official held that the policy did not appear to 
violate federal anti-discrimination guidelines. Kemp also stayed HUD 
regulations that took effect on June 1 that prohibited immigrants who have been 
granted temporary residency from benefiting from some HUD assistance programs 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said he was concerned about the inconsistencies that, for example, barred 
a legal resident from receiving child care or a job under HUD-funded community 
development block grant programs but allowed such benefits under other federal 
assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he was concerned that the Costa Mesa measure could set a 
precedent, with other cities attempting to enact similar restrictive funding 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who also attended Wednesday's 
meeting, echoed those concerns and said "all participants agreed that cities 
are not equipped to be INS enforcers." 
</P>
<P>
"When enforcement guidelines are decided, they will be issued at the federal 
level and will apply to all cities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp and officials from Orange County will meet again to discuss specific 
guidelines next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said that participants also agreed that emergency services "ought to be 
treated separately." 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of someone who is severly hurt and needs medical attention, do we 
put them on hold while checking for their status?" he asked. "Yet, taking 
current laws and regulations to their extreme, that is what would result." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who has supported modifying some immigration restrictions, said he will 
move to enact some of the changes when Congress takes up another immigration 
matter -- whether to increase quotas for lawful immigration -- in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be germane to amend (immigration law) to include the kinds of 
reforms that Kemp is asking for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nativo Lopez, director of the Santa-Ana based Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, said 
his group would support efforts to repeal immigration laws that deny benefits 
to legal residents "either legislatively or administratively." 
</P>
<P>
And Mario Moreno, a representative of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, said it is important that community groups not be made an arm 
of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that the determination of legal status is not an easy thing 
even for an expert," Moreno said. "It would be even more difficult to leave 
that in the hands of someone -- like a receptionist -- who is not trained to 
make that determination." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Mayor Peter Buffa, who with City Manager Allan Roeder represented 
the city, called the meeting "very productive." However, he voiced concern that 
the city still has no clear-cut direction on whether it can require community 
groups to adhere to immigration laws when providing services. The city has 
approved applications for more than $114,000 in federal grants that are 
scheduled to be distributed in October. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to have some kind of statement in place that refers to 
compliance with federal immigration laws," Buffa said. "Exactly how that is 
phrased is of great concern to HUD. We are hoping to come up with some mutually 
agreeable language." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's so-called anti-alien funding policy was passed last August amid 
debate about growing numbers of illegal aliens entering the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Orville Amburgey argued that undocumented aliens, including 
large gatherings of dayworkers who had been congregating on city streets and in 
parks, were attracted, in part, by free food, medical care and other assistance 
offered by charitable groups in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was intended to restrict such services to legal residents or cut off 
city funds to organizations that did not comply. But the plan outraged the 
county's charitable and immigrant rights organizations as well as religious 
leaders, who called the policy insensitive and impractical.

NAME GAME: Sometimes you just can't win. . . . Customers of Lincoln National 
Bank in Encino confused it with infamous Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Even the institutions' owners had similar names: John Keating at Lincoln 
National, Charles Keating at Lincoln Savings. . . . So Lincoln National 
announced it would change its name to California United Bank. A simple 
solution? Not exactly. Now it's being sued by United California Savings Bank of 
Santa Ana, which won a temporary order this week forbidding the name change.

With the county already hurting financially from the recent incorporations of 
Mission Viejo, Dana Point and Laguna Niguel, officials said Wednesday that it 
cannot afford more defections, and derailed plans to create two new cities by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of separate drives to incorporate Laguna Hills and the communities of 
El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills have prepared applications to the Local 
Agency Formation Commission in hopes of having ballot measures approved in time 
for the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
But in a hearing Wednesday afternoon, LAFCO commissioners said that more 
information is needed before a decision can be made on whether the county can 
afford to allow the unincorporated areas to form Orange County's 30th and 31st 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is currently facing a shortfall of more than $30 million for the 
fiscal year beginning at the end of the month. Cutbacks in state funding for 
county programs and increasing demand for county services have been the main 
reason for the fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
But in two reports issued last week, LAFCO and the County Administrative Office 
said the county has lost nearly $14 million in sales tax revenues with the 
incorporations of Mission Viejo in March, 1988, Dana Point in January, 1989, 
and Laguna Niguel in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
If Laguna Hills became a city, the county would lose about $5 million in tax 
revenue in the first year, according to a LAFCO staff report that recommended 
denial of the Laguna Hills plan. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, sales tax revenue from Laguna Hills makes up about one-third of the 
total sales tax revenues generated by unincorporated areas, the report said. 
Much of that comes from the Laguna Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
No study was made on how much the El Toro cityhood proposal would cost the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The incorporations of Mission Viejo, Dana Point and Laguna Niguel -- the first 
since Irvine incorporated in 1971 -- have cost the county $13.81 million in tax 
revenue, according to a Jan. 6 report by County Administrative Officer Earnie 
Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
The county can no longer afford to either lose the tax revenue from the 
commercial sections of these communities or pay the start-up costs involved in 
providing the new cities with police, fire, library and other county-contracted 
services, said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who is also chairman of the 
five-member LAFCO commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Both groups would like to get to the ballot as soon as possible," LAFCO 
director James J. Colangelo told LAFCO commissioners on Wednesday, "but with 
this county in the present financial condition, a November election is out of 
the question." 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled LAFCO hearing on the plan to form an 8-square-mile city in Laguna 
Hills was continued to Oct. 3. A hearing on the effort to create a 
21-square-mile city out of El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills was continued 
to July 11. But Colangelo said he will recommend that that hearing be continued 
to either Sept. 26 or Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
In postponing the hearings, Colangelo said the county and cityhood proponents 
must provide more information before commissioners decide whether the proposals 
can go before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday ordered a six-month study on 
the practice of providing cities with contractual services. Vasquez said that 
under the current policies, the county is not recouping all its costs, despite 
charging cities millions of dollars for services that include police and fire 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood plans for Laguna Hills and El Toro both call for county service 
contracts. But Vasquez said that cityhood proponents should draft alternate 
reports that guarantee financial stability if the proposed cities provided 
their own police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
In the long term, he said, cities pay for the services, but during the start-up 
phase of cityhood the county foots a large portion of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest that voters could decide on either the Laguna Hills or the El 
Toro-Lake Forest-Portola Hills measures will be March 5, Colangelo said. 
Vasquez said that will be sufficient time for the cityhood proponents and the 
county to review their financial conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Martin, head of the pro-cityhood group Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, 
said she was disappointed that her organization will be unable to make good on 
their promise of a November vote. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, she was not willing to criticize the county for the decision to 
stop the drive for a November vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it does any good to cry mistreatment," Martin said. "We just 
have to work through it." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, voters in Laguna Hills have gone to the polls twice to decide on 
cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The first attempt to incorporate a wide area of the Saddleback Valley failed. 
The next year, voters in Laguna Hills narrowly defeated a plan to form their 
own city, largely because voters in the Leisure World retirement community 
opposed inclusion. The current Laguna Hills plan excludes Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood leaders said that they would ultimately prevail in creating a city, 
despite the latest setback. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certainly developed a lot of patience over the years," organizer 
Melody P. Carruth said on Wednesday. "But given more time, we have a lot of 
confidence that it will be approved." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Wilson, chairwoman of Community Coalition to Incorporate El Toro, Lake 
Forest and Portola Hills, said she was surprised by the decision and questioned 
why the issue did not come up before last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand that they are looking at these numbers today," Wilson said. 
"They they should have looked at the numbers some time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said the decision to postpone the hearings was not made because of 
anti-cityhood sentiment on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with incorporation," Vasquez said. "It's the hard 
reality that the dollars are not being made available on the county level."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SCHOOL BOUNDARY LINE CHANGE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY

<TEXT>
<P>
A black line on a map should be no reason to force students to attend high 
school five miles away in La Habra, a group of parents argued to school 
district officials Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The school attendance boundary line for the Fullerton Joint Union High School 
District cuts across Rosecrans Avenue in Fullerton, requiring students living 
just north of the line in the Coyote Hills section to attend Sonora High School 
in La Habra, rather than the neighboring Sunny Hills High School about a mile 
and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting several times this year with the Coyote Hills residents to hear 
their concerns, Supt. Kenneth Jones told about 30 parents Tuesday that he still 
recommends that school board members keep attendance boundaries intact. After 
hearing Jones' report on the matter, the school board took no action. 
</P>
<P>
Coyote Hills residents left the meeting right after the report, disappointed 
that no school board member commented on the matter and vowing to continue the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be polite and not make this thing explode," said Robert Feng, who 
has a son who is a seventh-grader at Park Junior High destined to be bused to 
Sonora in two years. "But now we've had it." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, he said, parents will be meeting to determine their 
next course of action, which includes asking an attorney what legal steps they 
can take to force the boundary change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyote Hills, with about 500 homes near Gilbert Street north of Rosecrans, was 
included in the attendance boundary in 1980, when only a few houses existed in 
the area. But development of the Coyote Hills Estates in the early 1980s 
brought more families and gathering resentment of the boundary lines. 
</P>
<P>
Parents argue that the lines: 
</P>
<P>
* Require that their children be bused to another city rather than walking to 
the nearer high school in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
* Break up friendships when their children, who attended grade school and 
junior high school with children living just south of Rosecrans, must go to a 
different high school. 
</P>
<P>
* Make after-school activities difficult. 
</P>
<P>
* Encourage parents to violate the boundary either by enrolling their children 
in exotic-language classes at Sunny Hills that aren't provided at Sonora, or by 
using false addresses inside the Sunny Hills boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that moving the lines to accommodate the students would: 
</P>
<P>
* Hurt the educational program at Sonora. Shifting the students would require 
shifting some teachers, reducing the types and number of classes that can be 
offered at Sonora, which already is the smallest high school in the district. 
</P>
<P>
* Upset the racial mix at Sonora, which already has many minority, mostly 
Latino, students. 
</P>
<P>
* Result in a "domino effect" of more parents asking to have boundary lines 
changed to allow their children to attend other schools.

SPECIFICS SOUGHT ON SPILL PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays, in a detailed letter to the State Lands Commission, has 
asked the agency to explain its emergency procedures involving offshore oil 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
Mays took the action in the wake of the June 11 offshore oil spill at Bolsa 
Chica State Beach, the source of which has still not been pinpointed. Oil 
carried by ocean water stained part of the state beach, causing its temporary 
closure. Mays said he believes that the oil came from one of two offshore 
oil-drilling platforms about a mile off the city's shore. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission has jurisdiction over California shores from the 
high-water mark to three miles at sea. Many of the state's offshore oil 
platforms have been built within the three-mile limit. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the state, Mays said the city has questions about the 
environmental and physical safety of the offshore oil platforms. He said the 
city's questions include: 
</P>
<P>
* Who is responsible for the day-to-day standards, operation, maintenance, 
training, inspection and safety of the offshore platforms within the Huntington 
Beach city limits? 
</P>
<P>
* Specifically, who and what governmental agency is in charge of spills, fires 
or other emergencies when they occur? 
</P>
<P>
* What emergency contingency plans and standing orders are in place? 
</P>
<P>
* Who prepares these plans and who insures compliance? 
</P>
<P>
* Specifically, what emergency resources are immediately available to cope with 
these emergencies? 
</P>
<P>
* Specifically what deficiencies are there, and what is the action program to 
ensure maximum safety and environmental protection? 
</P>
<P>
Mays' letter said that "too often citizens and public officials find out too 
late that full protective measures were not in place." He said a recent example 
was the February oil spill on city beaches from the tanker American Trader. 
That spill of 394,000 gallons of oil occurred when the tanker ran aground on 
its anchor. The U.S. Coast Guard said the depth of the water surrounding the 
mooring had not been regularly surveyed. BILL BILLITER

TREE EXPERTS EXPLAIN HOW TO OBTAIN MORE

<TEXT>
<P>
If you want more trees to grace your city but don't have the tax money to buy 
them, try starting an adopt-a-tree program or creating a memorial tree park. 
</P>
<P>
Those were a few of the suggestions that Northern California experts offered 
Wednesday during a daylong workshop in Anaheim for turning urbanized Orange 
County into a greener place. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people -- mostly parks and recreation officials from several cities 
and counties -- listened intently to members of California ReLeaf, the 
Sacramento Tree Foundation and the East Bay Regional Parks Foundation, who 
described the latest tactics in "releafing" the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need to care more about the trees; but it's all new to a lot of us," 
Yucaipa Councilwoman Lillian Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by California ReLeaf, which is part of the American Forestry Assn.'s 
Global ReLeaf program, the conference was an attempt to encourage Southern 
California cities to become more involved in planting and caring for trees. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Northern California are often thought to be the state's 
leaders in environmental concerns, and the sponsors brought lessons learned in 
that area. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Wade, director of urban forestry for California ReLeaf, told department 
leaders that they need to involve residents and arouse community interest, 
which in turn will encourage local politicians to find funding and other types 
of support. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to build the base of public support, because without that the 
politicians are not going to lead," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Cobb, executive director of the East Bay Regional Parks District, also 
discussed the need for community involvement in planting and caring for trees. 
She said that with city budget crunches, many local governments will need to 
rely on more help from volunteers if seedlings are to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Crum, parks services manager for Anaheim, said the workshop was helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"Often citizens are tired of their trees because they're tired of raking up 
leaves," Crum said. "This is good because it helps us explain to them the 
importance of trees." LISA MASCARO

AUTO CENTER TO GET BIG ELECTRONIC SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a year, the city has been promising dealers at the Anaheim Auto 
Center a big bright electronic sign resembling the kind other auto malls have 
to help attract business. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the dealers got what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved spending almost $200,000 for the sign and it should 
be up within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"It will make a whole load of difference," said Tony Lomax, a manager of one of 
the dealerships in the auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
The city was waiting to install the sign until more dealers moved to the 
center, but the Anaheim Auto Center Assn. of Dealers wanted the sign sooner. 
They argued that the sign would help make the center more attractive to both 
customers and new dealerships, both of which bring more sales tax revenue to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Three dealers have moved to the center at Ball Road and the Orange Freeway 
since the city opened it in 1986, but there is room for four more dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew in my own mind there had to be a sign there," said Dennis Hardin, a 
partial owner of an auto dealership that will soon be moving to the mall. "You 
really can't see the place without it." 
</P>
<P>
Before moving his dealership, Hardin said, he was waiting for a number of 
issues to be resolved, including that of the sign. He is giving up a portion of 
his land to house the sign but said it's a worthwhile exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The city is buying and installing the sign, and the dealers association will be 
responsible for its maintainance. The non-electronic sign in front of the auto 
mall will be removed when the new sign is installed. LISA MASCARO

PEOPLE: WEIGHT LOSER TURNS WEIGHT LIFTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago Gretchen Buerki powered her way through an arduous diet to lose 
35 pounds, dropping her to 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Then she turned around and deliberately put it all back on. And more. 
</P>
<P>
"I started my weight loss program with aerobics and a little weightlifting to 
tone my body," the Fullerton High School teacher said. "I didn't know it would 
take me to weight-lifting competition." 
</P>
<P>
She currently is in heavy training to compete in her age and weight division in 
the 1990 International Power Lifting Competition on July 22 in Leningrad and 
July 24 in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding to put the weight back on in order to compete was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was thin, I liked it," said Buerki, a graduate of Scripps College in 
Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
But the 47-year-old Fullerton resident, who stands 5 feet, 7 1/2 inches, 
decided she liked power lifting better. Now her trainer wants to see her at 180 
pounds in order to help her lift heavier weights. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it today as much as I did when I started three years ago," said Buerki, 
who didn't take weight lifting seriously until 1987, when she entered her first 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
There were nine women competing in that contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up ninth, but it showed me I could do it and I liked that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Buerki said people at the La Mirada Athletic Club, where she lifted weights as 
part of her diet training, were impressed and urged her to enter competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"But I told them I was too old and there was no way I wanted to do that," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, while lifting weights with other women in the gym, "I found I was very 
strong and could lift weights very well." 
</P>
<P>
Buerki, a resource specialist who teaches children with learning disabilities 
in reading, writing and spelling, entered some contests and then started 
setting weight-lifting goals for herself. 
</P>
<P>
Her first goal was 100 pounds and now her goal is to break the dead-lift record 
of 165 pounds for women ages 45 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of all, I always want to do my personal best, because if you break the 
record there will always be someone who can outlift you," she said. "I don't 
want to compare myself with others." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what she does in weight lifting, Buerki has a big group of 
supporters, especially the students at her school. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids at school really love it," she said. "They ooh and aah and like to 
feel my biceps, and they really seem to respect what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Of her weight lifter's physique, she said: "I don't feel any less feminine. I'm 
still a very feminine person." 
</P>
<P>
She is married to Robert Buerki, 48, a business consultant, and has a daughter, 
Noel, 19. "She's my biggest fan and my husband is my biggest booster," Buerki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weight lifting may lead to other pursuits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel someday that power lifting will open other thoughts in my mind, 
including helping others as their personal trainer or something," she said. 
"It's kind of a whole new world opening up for me and I don't know where it 
will take me." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Maken repairs antique phonographs and collects Thomas Edison artifacts in 
his Huntington Beach home business called Yesterday Once Again. 
</P>
<P>
So when Phillip B. Peterson, 68, a former Stanford University professor, wanted 
to sell him some extremely rare Edison autographs, Maken became suspicious and 
called the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
It was later discovered that the Edison autographs and other items were stolen 
from the Thomas A. Edison National History Site in West Orange, N.J., and 
Peterson was sentenced to three months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI had wired Maken to record a meeting with Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of fun working with the FBI," Maken said. "It's an experience 
most of us never have." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, it was a bittersweet experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bitter and disappointed that he was given a light sentence, but it was 
sweet for the museum to recover these valuable documents," he said.

INFANTS TO BE GIVEN MEASLES SHOTS IN FIGHT AGAINST EPIDEMIC; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AUTHORITIES TO LOWER THE NORMAL INOCULATION AGE FROM 15 MONTHS TO UNDER 
ONE YEAR IN AN ALL-OUT EFFORT TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. 
</P>

<P>
County health officials, in an all-out effort to halt the spread of red measles 
among small children in Orange County, say they will begin giving measles 
vaccines to high-risk infants under the age of 1 beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
Medical officials usually suggest children receive the vaccination after 15 
months due to the often low effectiveness rate the shot may have in infants. 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, children are given this shot at or around 15 months," said Ken 
Anderson of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. "Prior to that time, 
maternal antibodies are more than likely still present in the baby's system." 
</P>
<P>
A baby receives the antibodies against diseases while still in the mother's 
womb. Shortly after birth, the passive antibodies lose their effectiveness, and 
the child begins to build his own defenses against diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to vaccinate infants comes in the wake of 12 measles-related 
deaths in California this year, including two in Orange County. By contrast, 
there were only 10 deaths statewide last year. 
</P>
<P>
Because Orange County has declared measles a public health emergency, as have 
many other counties, it will share in a $5.8-million special state fund created 
to fight the epidemic. Orange County health officials say the county will 
receive enough vaccine to inoculate about 3,000 children. The doses will be 
distributed to more than 74 Well-Child Health Clinics in Orange County, where 
high-risk infants will be inoculated beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
Red measles causes a rash, high fever and a dry cough for about 10 days. It can 
also cause brain damage and possible death. 
</P>
<P>
"Though it isn't done on a regular basis, local health officials may find a 
serious outbreak situation warrants this type of early vaccination," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The measles epidemic has plagued southern California for more than two years, 
and Anderson added that it may be caused by children not getting the 
vaccination shots at the prescribed time. 
</P>
<P>
At 15 months, children are required to received a vaccination that will protect 
them from the measles, mumps and rubella. The shot that will be given in the 
coming weeks will only protect the child from the measles. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the county will concentrate on vaccinating only children at high risk 
for the disease-those mostly from impoverished and Latino backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"A very large percentage of the children afflicted with measles have been 
Hispanics," said Gerald Wagner, director of the local health department's 
immunization center. "What we are hoping to do is reach these children when 
they come into our Well-Child clinics for checkups or what have you." 
</P>
<P>
State and local health officials speculate that poor Latino children are at a 
higher risk because of crowded living conditions and because their mothers may 
not have had the disease. If a mother has not had the measles, she will not 
pass any protection to her unborn child.

DISPUTE: SUSPENDED FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL DIRECTOR DAVID QUEZADA GAVE A FORMER

<P>
City officials said Wednesday that they will ask David T. Quezada, the 
suspended director of the Fair Housing Council of Orange County, to pay $1,935 
in relocation assistance to a woman who was evicted from one of his apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada is being asked to pay the money because he had evicted the tenant from 
a rental unit that was built without city permission. The tenant complained to 
city code enforcement officers this week that Quezada had written her a check 
for $1,935, but that it was not honored by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada, 40, who was suspended June 6 from his post as director of the publicly 
funded Fair Housing Council, said Wednesday that he stopped payment on the 
check in order to resolve a disagreement over the relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada sent a letter to the former tenant, Julia Campos Olivos, and the city 
last week, notifying them of his intention to stop payment and asking the city 
to step in as an arbitrator in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely not refusing to pay; that is not my intent," Quezada said. 
"The only thing the letter brings up is my rights, that David has rights, too." 
</P>
<P>
Quezada's letter to the tenant and the city offers to put any disputed amount 
into an escrow account while the disagreement is being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Since Fullerton has no arbitration procedures to handle his request, the city 
said it plans to send a letter to Quezada this week, asking him to pay the 
$1,935 within 10 days or file an appeal with City Manager William C. Winter, 
according to Karen Atkinson, the city's senior code enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
Under city law, Atkinson said, Quezada is required to pay relocation assistance 
to Campos because she was required to move from an illegal duplex housing unit 
that Quezada owns in the 300 block of East Truslow Avenue. Campos had been 
living in a third unit that Quezada said he created in the late 1970s by moving 
interior walls around inside the duplex. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada said he is questioning the application of the city law under which code 
enforcement officials had asked him to pay relocation assistance. He declined 
to discuss the case further, saying that publicity surrounding the issue has 
cast a shadow over his 20-year career in fighting housing discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather not have the media arbitrate us at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada is now under city order to repair the duplex to bring it up to city and 
state housing codes. Last month, city and county inspectors, acting on a 
complaint from the tenant, found rotted flooring, broken and stuck windows, and 
other apparent code violations at the duplex. A check into city records also 
revealed that the third unit had been built without city approval. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that it will take about $12,500 in repairs to bring the 
duplex up to housing codes. Quezada has not yet taken out necessary permits to 
make the repairs, but he has been cooperating with city officials to resolve 
the problems, Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After the violations were publicized, the Fair Housing Council suspended 
Quezada from his post as director until the duplex is brought into compliance. 
The council, a nonprofit agency funded by grants from the county and various 
cities, helps landlords and tenants resolve disputes and checks into complaints 
of housing discrimination, 
</P>
<P>
Quezada has said he gave Campos an eviction notice in order to convert the 
building back into a legal duplex in preparation for taking out a loan against 
it. The tenant then filed the complaint with the city, he said. Until then, she 
had never complained of problems at the unit that weren't promptly repaired, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Campos, though, has said that she complained to Quezada several times about 
problems with the carpet, walls and windows. During the entire five years she 
lived there, she contends, he never came when she called with a problem except 
when it was time to collect rent.

SUSPECT IN STORE THEFTS CAUGHT AFTER TIP TO POLICE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A WOMAN TAILED A MAN SHE SAW RUNNING FROM A NEWPORT BEACH JEWELER'S, GOT

<TEXT>
<P>
A tip from an alert passer-by who tailed a theft suspect as he fled from a 
Newport Beach jewelry store led to the arrest of a Redondo Beach man wanted by 
police in connection with half a dozen jewlery-store thefts in South Coast 
Plaza, Fashion Island, Mission Viejo and San Diego County, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Robert Boyes, 23, accused of stealing $41,000 in two Newport Beach 
thefts, was arrested Friday in Gardena after detectives tracked him down with 
the help of license plate information from a witness. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, a Newport Beach woman, whom they would not identify, 
became suspicious when she observed a man fitting Boyes' description running 
from Mozaffarian Jewelry at 2901 W. Coast Highway on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
"She said he was running across Coast Highway, carrying a black bag and looking 
over his shoulder," Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the thief, posing as a customer, snatched 10 rings off a 
display counter at the jewlery store and ran off before the sales clerks had 
time to react. 
</P>
<P>
The woman followed the theft suspect up Riverside Drive and then drove up to 
next to him while he stepped into a car parked near Cliff Drive Park. She told 
police she pretended to admire a house nearby while her daughter wrote down the 
car's license plate. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Boyes, who is also wanted by authorities in Florida, was 
charged with commercial burglary, grand theft and possession of stolen 
property. He was being held at the Orange County Jail on Wednesday in lieu of 
$150,000 bail, Gonis said.

PETERSON STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT

He's an overnight sensation who insists he's not. 
</P>
<P>
In April, he won the 16-and-under division at the Easter Bowl tournament in 
Miami, his first national championship. He said he wasn't surprised. Others 
were, and wanted to know more about him. They were eager to see how he would 
fare next. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, he swept to the 16s title at the Ojai Valley tournament. 
Observers of junior tennis nodded in appreciation of this latest, gifted player 
to emerge from a horde of talented age-group players. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Adam Peterson, a 15-year-old from Orange who recently finished his 
sophomore year at Mater Dei High School. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, he was merely the younger, promising brother of Dax Peterson, 
a standout at Mater Dei who now plays at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson maintains he is well-known. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been seeded pretty high in some national tournaments," he said after 
winning at Ojai. "People know me." 
</P>
<P>
That's true in the tightly woven circle of junior tennis. But if he keeps 
playing this well, he also will turn the heads of casual followers of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
His string of victories this spring has earned him the No. 1 seeding in the 
Southern California Junior Sectional tournament, which begins Saturday at Los 
Caballeros Racquet Club in Fountain Valley. He has never finished higher than 
fourth, but figures to be one of the favorites to reach the final on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
How has he done it? 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he hasn't varied his routine. He spends as much time practicing 
at the same clubs, with the same people as he did five years ago when he began 
to take the sport seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Really, he can't explain it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to play every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by his recent victories, his confidence seems to be soaring. His 
movements have been precise and assured this spring, helping his game reach new 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Said David Roditi of San Clemente, after knuckling under to Peterson's 
relentless pressure in a 6-1, 6-1 loss in the Ojai final: "He didn't let me do 
anything today. That's the best I've ever seen him play." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson seems unfazed by such praise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with my (recent) performances," he said. "I just wanted to 
practice for the big tournaments. I wanted to do well. That was my goal." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson began playing at age "seven or eight," nudged into the sport by his 
family. Not long after, the Petersons moved from Toledo, Ohio, to Orange County 
where the weather was more inviting to year-round play. 
</P>
<P>
When he was "nine or 10" he began to play age-group tournaments with some 
success. He began playing national tournaments at 12. 
</P>
<P>
But his first national title didn't come until he won the Easter Bowl title in 
his first try this spring. Last year, he was ranked only among the top 35 in 
the country and his best finish at a national tournament was the round of 16 at 
the hardcourt championships in San Jose last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, he calls the Easter Bowl tournament "a great experience." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to explain," he said. "It was fun because it was my first national 
title. I didn't think about winning when I went there." 
</P>
<P>
But on April 14, he breezed past J.J. Jackson of Hendersonville, N.C., 6-2, 
6-2, for the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing really good toward the end of the tournament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since his victory at Ojai, Peterson won the Angelus League singles title and 
advanced to the quarterfinals of the Southern Section tournament, losing to 
Peter Jeschke of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the upcoming sectional tournament to be as difficult as any 
he has played this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to put myself in a position to do well," Peterson said. "If I win, 
it'll be great. If not, then I'll try again next year." 
</P>
<P>

</P>

SALAZAR REPLACES JARAMILLO FOR NORTH

Jose Salazar, an offensive lineman from Servite High School, has replaced 
Valencia's Paul Jaramillo on the North roster for the Orange County all-star 
football game, North Coach Tom Meiss said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When Meiss learned that Jaramillo had decided on Wednesday not to play, he did 
not hesitate to call Salazar, 5 feet 10 and 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this year, Jose read in the paper that he had been nominated for the 
team and wrote me a nice note thanking me," Meiss said. "It broke my heart when 
I called him and told him he was only nominated for the team and hadn't 
actually made it. I told him if anyone dropped out, he would be my first 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
The North team started practicing Monday for the all-star game, which will be 
July 6 at Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. The South team will begin 
practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just out there in shorts going through blocking drills," Meiss said. 
"The kids are looking good and have a good work attitude. The only thing I'm 
disappointed with is some kids are saying at the last minute that they can't 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Meiss said Los Alamitos' Erik Mitchell has been practicing at cornerback as 
well as running back, his usual position. Mitchell, 5-10 and 165 pounds, has 
signed a letter of intent to play at Colorado next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the kids to experiment at other positions," Meiss said. "Erik said he 
wanted to try it."

HITACHI TO MERGE SOUTHLAND SALES, PRODUCTION UNITS 
</P>

Hitachi Ltd. will merge two Southern California divisions in a move to 
strengthen its position in the highly competitive U.S. consumer electronics 
market, company officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based Hitachi Consumer Products of America Inc. and Hitachi Sales Corp. 
of America in Compton will be merged in October into a new company to be called 
Hitachi Home Electronics of America Inc., based in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The new unit will combine Hitachi's television and videocassette recorder 
manufacturing plants in Anaheim and Tijuana, Mexico, with its sales and 
marketing force in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Takehiko Kataoka, president of Hitachi Sales, the Japanese-based parent's U.S. 
marketing arm, said an official announcement of the merger will be made today 
in Tokyo. Company sources said Kataoka is expected to be named president of the 
new company. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will not result in any major changes in management or employment at 
the Anaheim, Compton or Tijuana operations, Kataoka said, adding that "no one 
will be fired." 
</P>
<P>
A Hitachi executive, who asked not to be identified, said the merger includes 
moving some production of 27-inch and larger TVs from Japan to the United 
States, where demand is strong for large-screen TVs. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim and Tijuana plants will continue to make VCRs but will cease 
manufacturing of 19- to 26-inch TVs. Production of those models will be moved 
to the Far East, the Hitachi executive said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Anaheim and Tijuana plants produced 20,000 color TV sets, mostly 
19- and 20-inch models. Hitachi manufactures about 90% of the large-screen TVs 
it sells in the United States in Tokyo, Hitachi officials said.

BRIEFCASE: LUTHER MEDICAL PICKS TATE SCOTT TO SERVE AS ITS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Luther Medical Products Inc., the Tustin-based maker of "stickless catheters" 
designed to protect health care workers from AIDS, Wednesday named Tate Scott 
its new president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping down as president is company founder Ron Luther, who will remain as 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who started with Luther in 1987 as director of marketing, was promoted 
to executive vice president and elected to the board of directors last year. 
</P>
<P>
Luther said in a prepared statement that Scott's "pivotal role in securing two 
exclusive marketing contracts with Johnson &amp; Johnson/Critikon and his 
success in the turnaround of our Neuro-Diagnostics division from near 
insolvency to profitability speaks clearly of his abilities." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Luther Medical bought Neuro-Diagnostics Inc., a financially 
failing company in Garden Grove that made medical diagnostic instruments used 
by neurologists. Luther said he called upon Scott, who was then Luther 
Medical's marketing manager, to take charge of Neuro-Diagnostics. 
</P>
<P>
"He reorganized the company and put together a team of technicians who 
successfully developed a much improved instrument," Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
After handing Scott responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the 
company, Luther plans to spend more time developing new products and improving 
investor relations. He said Luther's stock price, at about 60 cents a share, 
does not reflect the potential of the company, which he predicts is about to 
have its first profitable year.

Merger Canceled: Nichols Institute, the medical laboratory firm in San Juan 
Capistrano that is bent on expanding through acquisitions, has retreated from a 
previously announced merger with Pittsburgh-based Med-Chek Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said the companies were "not able to establish mutually satisfactory 
contractual arrangements for the merger" but that Nichols will continue to 
supply services and products to Med-Check, which operates a clinical reference 
laboratory in Pittsburgh and serves customers in the Northeast.

POP BEAT: CHANNEL THREE BACK IN PICTURE;

<P>
BAND THAT WENT BLANK AFTER PUNK ROCK BEGINNINGS IS SWITCHING ON WITH A REUNION 
IN LONG BEACH

<P>
In most places without cable, Channel 3 on the television dial leaves you in a 
video void of white noise and static. 
</P>
<P>
That image had its appeal a decade ago for Mike Magrann and Kimm Gardener, two 
young punk rockers who grew up together in Cerritos. They dubbed their band 
Channel Three and began playing songs full of noisy commentary about some of 
the pictures in society, in the punk rock scene and in themselves that they 
thought needed adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
After a seven-year career that saw the release of three albums and two EPs, 
several national tours and considerable musical maturation beyond those dark, 
hollering hard-core punk beginnings, Channel Three went blank in 1987. But 
recent developments have prompted Magrann and Gardener to switch the picture 
back on, at least temporarily. Channel Three will stage a reunion show Friday 
night at Bogart's in Long Beach. They also will make a live television 
appearance Friday at 4:30 p.m. on the "Request Video" show on Anaheim-based 
KDOC Channel 56. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion for the reunion concert is the recent release of "Rejected," a 
wryly titled collection of demo recordings that Channel Three made from 1985 to 
1987 in a foiled bid to land a major-label contract. Released on Lone Wolf 
Records, a custom label owned by a Canadian fan of the band, "Rejected" is a 
welcome addition to the Channel Three file, full of boisterous, Rolling 
Stones-style rock and well-wrought lyrics by Magrann, one of the best musical 
storytellers to come out of the early '80s Southern California punk boom. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week in Magrann's apartment in Seal Beach -- a spacious, 
airy place with a skylight and contemporary, pastel decor upstairs; a shrine to 
Elvis Presley and assorted punk rockers in a small den downstairs -- the two 
Channel Three founders said they are not trying to jump back into the rock 'n' 
roll success sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
Magrann, who fronted the band as its singer, and Gardener, who played guitar, 
think it's fun that Channel Three has found a cult audience in Europe, where 
its early, hard-core recordings were released last year on a CD called "The 
Skinhead Years." They also are happy that two of their old punk anthems turned 
up recently on an episode of the television show "21 Jump Street." 
</P>
<P>
But Magrann, 29, and Gardener, 28, aren't keen about renewing their pursuit of 
a full-time rock 'n' roll career. Weariness with the careerist aspects of rock 
music caused Channel Three to break up the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
"It got so business-oriented that it just wasn't fun anymore," recalled the 
tall, deep-voiced Magrann, whose black hair sweeps upward in a modified version 
of a Presley pompadour. "That's part of the reason we drifted apart. When it 
got to the point where the band was a deal to be offered to people and argued 
over the phone, it wasn't the band anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three had no trouble building a following in its early days on the punk 
scene, where it first emerged with shows at Orange County's early-'80s punk 
breeding ground, the Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa. Channel Three's blazing-fast 
music and rebellious themes fit right in with what slam-dancing, stage-diving 
young audiences were looking for. But as time went on, Channel Three found 
itself in a dilemma faced by many of the early punk bands: should it keep 
playing hard and fast, thereby guaranteeing it a solid following, or should it 
follow the inner voices that said there must be more to musical life than 
hollered vocals and racing tempos? 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three's break with hard-core came when it shifted from Posh Boy 
Records, the label that first recorded such bands as T.S.O.L., Agent Orange, 
the Adolescents and Social Distortion, to Enigma Records. A 1984 EP, 
"Airborne," and the 1985 album "Last Time I Drank" were melodic hard-rock 
albums, not punk records. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both deleted," Magrann said. "We were more or less in confrontation 
with Enigma before ('Last Time I Drank') even came out, which does wonders for 
your marketing. They were expecting to take over a punk band which was a proven 
seller. We wanted to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
The experimentation continued with the tapes now collected on "Rejected." 
Originally inspired by the Ramones' breakneck pop, the members of Channel Three 
became interested in exploring such influences as the Rolling Stones, the Band, 
and country music. Magrann's creative writing studies at Cal State Long Beach 
came in handy as he crafted literate but unpretentious lyrics such as the 
half-funny, half-pathetic relationship crackup ballad "Gone Drinkin'." Several 
other songs honed in on a recurring theme that runs through all of Channel 
Three's releases -- the fear that life is going to grow stale and soggy as time 
goes on, making it hard to keep a youthful spark lit. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three's shift in style made it a hard band to sell, said Steve Rennie, 
the former Avalon Attractions vice president who took over as the band's 
manager in the mid-'80s and tried unsuccessfully to sign it to a new recording 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they alienated some of the punk fans, and they weren't quite 
mainstream enough" for major labels, Rennie said. Maybe if Channel Three could 
have kept playing and recording for a few more years, Rennie suggested, it 
could have caught the same wave that has elevated Social Distortion from a 
former cult band for hard-core punks to mainstream-contender status. 
</P>
<P>
"People were saying, 'Is it a punk band, or is it a rock 'n' roll band?' 
recalled Gardener, who still wears punkish spikes in his long, reddish-blond 
hair. "If we had waited three years down the line, the timing would have been 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The two Channel Three founders, friends since second grade, don't see their 
reunion as the start of another all-out attempt to land a recording deal and 
revitalize their rock careers. 
</P>
<P>
Gardener and Magrann both said they are happy with less ambition-driven forms 
of music making. Besides working a daytime job in a metal shop, Magrann knocks 
out blues and rockabilly sets with a band called Blue Diamonds, which sometimes 
appears at the cozy Sunset Pub in Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Gardener, a manager for a La Palma computer company, played in a band called 
Bulldog until a year ago. Now that he is out of the rock scene and no longer 
has to devote time to booking shows and paying attention to band business 
affairs (a role he played in Channel Three), Gardener said he has the time to 
polish his guitar technique by taking lessons. Both former punkers are engaged 
to be married. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Magrann and Gardener, the Channel Three lineup for the show at Bogart's 
features Ron Wood (the last of the band's 11 drummers), guitarist Mike Dimkich, 
who played bass in the final incarnation of Channel Three, and bassist Alan 
Bloch, late of Concrete Blonde, who is filling in for longtime member James 
Lansford, who last year moved to West Germany to work for a record company. 
</P>
<P>
Magrann and Gardener said that Lansford, who co-wrote the songs on "Rejected," 
has suggested doing a new album for his German label, and perhaps staging a 
Channel Three tour of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of talk," said Magrann. "The possibility of recording in the 
future seems real attractive, because we all have tons of songs ready to go. 
Promoters are calling. It's apparently a valuable commodity now. But if 
anything comes, it has to be on our terms." 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see that the end of the rainbow is driving around in a van for 10 
months of the year," Gardener said. "We did that." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Three, Rhythm &amp; Booze and the Cause play Friday at 9 p.m. at 
Bogart's in the Marina Pacifica Mall, 6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long 
Beach. Tickets: $10. Information: (213) 594-8975. 
</P>
<P>
 PUNK FLASHBACK: Frontier Records will finally issue a CD version of "The 
Adolescents," the bracing debut album by one of the key bands of the Orange 
County punk-rock boom. The release is scheduled for next month, according to 
label head Lisa Fancher. It is part of a CD-reissue program for Frontier, with 
distribution through its major-label partner, RCA/BMG. Regrettably, the late, 
lamented Pontiac Brothers won't be part of the CD reissue effort, because their 
first two Frontier albums, "Doll Hut" and "Fiesta en la Biblioteca," never sold 
more than a pittance when they first appeared, Fancher said. 
</P>
<P>
GOSPEL OF THE BLUES: Borrowing a chapter from the Cowboy Junkies, who recorded 
their acclaimed album "The Trinity Sessions" in a church, Huntington Beach 
bluesman Robert Lucas is going to record his first full-length album live in a 
cathedral in Montecito, near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who sings and plays guitar and harmonica, will be accompanied by bass, 
mandolin and violin in the sessions, which are scheduled for July 1 through 3. 
The album will be released this fall by AudioQuest, a new label that is an 
offshoot of a San Clemente-based maker of high-tech sound components geared for 
the audiophile market. Lucas will be playing solo shows every Tuesday night 
through July and August at Takao in San Clemente, and every Thursday at 
Cagney's in Huntington Beach.

What some dads won't do for their little girls. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Here's the deal. It seems that dear old pop, eager to catch a royal husband for 
his daughter, spins a wild yarn that could cost him his head. Things are 
starting to look pretty, well, grim, when a mysterious dwarf appears to save 
the day. Or does he? 
</P>
<P>
Families can find out the answer to these and other mysteries tonight when the 
Lilliput Players bring their touring production of the Brothers Grimm fairy 
tale, "Rumpelstiltskin" to Anaheim's Pearson Park Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Our version is a little different from the classic story," explained Bill 
Durkin, managing director of the 13-year-old children's theater troupe. "In the 
original, the miller foolishly boasts that his daughter can spin straw into 
gold, and the greedy king says she must do it or she will die. In ours, the 
king isn't such a bad guy. He falls in love with the girl, and in order to 
marry her off, the miller comes up with this story about the gold. 
Unfortunately, the penalty for lying in the kingdom is death. 
</P>
<P>
"So Rumpelstiltskin comes along, and for two nights, he helps the girl by 
magically turning the straw into gold. But on the third night, he tricks her." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1977, the Lilliput Players has presented its version of classic 
children's stories to an estimated 1.5 million children and adults in more than 
4,500 performances across Orange, San Diego, Los Angeles and Riverside 
counties. This season, the troupe staged three children's works, 
"Rumpelstiltskin," "The Pied Piper" and "Merlin" in about 350 schools, parks 
and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Lilliput Players' parent company is L.P. Repertory, which produced eight 
seasons of family dinner theater at Fullerton's Muckenthaler Cultural Center 
before opening its own permanent facility in Tustin in 1988. Financial 
difficulties forced the site to close last month, but because the two 
organizations operated independently, the demise of L.P. Repertory had no 
impact on the Lilliput Players. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's performance of "Rumpelstiltskin" is part of the Anaheim Parks and 
Recreation Department's "Just for Kids" program, an 11-week series of 
children's theater, music and dance sponsored by Target Stores and the Anaheim 
Arts Council. Admission to all Just for Kids events is $2 for adults and $1 for 
children under 12 and seniors. Children under 3 are admitted free. Just for 
Kids performances are at Pearson Park, 400 N. Harbor Blvd. (at Sycamore Street) 
in Anaheim. All shows are at 7:30 p.m., except July 26. Information: (714) 
999-5191.

Brow -- some of the most dastardly enemies that Dick Tracy ever faced. Enough 
to scare any self-respecting crime-stopper out of his two-way wrist radio. 
</P>
<P>
But they don't faze Paul Maher. He has 'em all in hand, even the sinister 
Rhodent and the slippery Spots, in the form of an antique Dick Tracy board 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is based on the old Dick Tracy cartoon show" (from 1961), said 
Maher, 37, cradling the item gently. "That's how I remember Dick Tracy the 
best. Other people might remember him from the radio show, or the serials, or 
some of those low-budget 1940s movies. By the way, this game goes for $150." 
</P>
<P>
Lest that price sound like a crime in itself, it helps to remember that finding 
the Dick Tracy board game -- and the plethora of other Tracy-ana in Maher's 
custody -- required a good deal of sleuthing. For as soon as collector 
extraordinaire Maher heard that Warren Beatty was bringing the hawk-nosed 
detective to cinematic life, he began haunting swap meets and collectors' shows 
in search of every bit of memorabilia he could glom onto -- of Tracy, Sam 
Catchem, Tess Trueheart, Sparkle Plenty, B.O. Plenty and the rest of the 
denizens of the legendary comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
Enough, ultimately, for the former archivist for Hanna-Barbera studios and 
Walter Lantz (creator of Woody Woodpecker), to devote an entire corner of his 
archives to cartoonist Chester Gould's funny-page police detective. 
</P>
<P>
His archives? Indeed. Not just a collector of Dick Tracy items, Maher is also 
the founder, owner, caretaker, cataloguer and protector of what he calls the 
Children's Television Archives -- a three-story North Hollywood townhouse 
crammed floor-to-ceiling with memorabilia of characters such as Tracy, Bugs 
Bunny, Felix the Cat, Caspar the Ghost, Bozo the Clown -- and just about every 
inked creature that ever lived in a comic strip or cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars are the ones that hurt the most, as far as prices go," said Maher, 
carefully hoisting an enormous tin squad car housing Tracy and Sam Catchem, 
dating from about 1950. "If this was in absolutely mint condition and had the 
windshield and the siren on the side, it's worth -- honest-to-God -- about 
$1,000, without the box! I've had other people tell me that they've seen them 
with the windshield, but without the Dick Tracy inside. So maybe someday I can 
fix the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, anyone looking to build a Tracy collection at this point is pretty much 
out of luck. Maher's hard-won collection -- including toys, games, photos, 
articles and books -- numbers no more than 50 items. Yet it's worth, he 
estimates, somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"If I went to a collectors' show right now, most likely I wouldn't find any 
more Dick Tracy," Maher said. "I mean, I can call all the collectors' stores 
all over, and they'll tell me we'd like to, but we already have four people in 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Why the paucity of Tracy collectibles? Reason No. 1: Tracy has not existed 
outside a comic strip since the 1961 cartoon show, and as a result, 
merchandising of Tracy-related items has been minimal. Reason No. 2: Larry 
Doucet. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more than 2,000 items in my collection, and I've been collecting for 
more than 30 years," said Doucet, a 43-year-old Yorktown Heights, N.Y., 
consulting engineer regarded as the king of the Dick Tracy collectors. "When I 
first read Dick Tracy when I was a 10-year-old, I was immediately hooked on the 
character. It was instantaneous. The stories, the great villains grabbed me. I 
started a quest for every comic book I could find. When I ran out of all the 
comic books, I knew there had to be more. So I started buying everything else I 
could find -- board games, cars, whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Doucet has the tin car -- with the windshield -- and it has indeed been 
appraised at about $1,000. The author of the forthcoming "Authorized Guide to 
Dick Tracy Collectibles" (Chilton, $12.95, with a foreword by Jean Gould 
O'Connell, Chester Gould's daughter) also counts among his many prized pieces 
things such as a Tracy cap pistol engraved by Chester Gould in 1978, some of 
the first Tracy character dolls and a Miller Bros. Hat Co. felt fedora, circa 
1947, with a Tracy logo inside. The value? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, people are pretty much speculating and hoarding this stuff and asking a 
lot more than it's worth," said Doucet, reached by phone. "Especially because 
of the movie. Some of these items, like dolls, are worth several thousand 
dollars. I have, for example, one of three known copies of a Dick Tracy comic 
book called No-Numbered Feature Book of 1937, and that's worth over $3,000. But 
it really comes down to what people are willing to pay." 
</P>
<P>
What of the slew of new, Disney-authorized Tracy merchandise? Well, without the 
pre-movie groundswell of interest, as there was months in advance of "Batman," 
Tracy-related sales have been slow -- or so says Bill Liebowitz, owner of the 
Golden Apple comic book stores in Hollywood, Northridge and West L.A. The sales 
"reps felt that people needed to see more publicity on the movie," he said, "so 
they didn't take orders for merchandise until April." Liebowitz does not 
predict a repeat of Batmania. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think 'Dick Tracy' will be a good solid merchandising, but I don't see 
anything hysterical," he said. "I don't see people coming in and demanding 
Madonna blowup dolls. I could probably sell a lot of those but . . . I mean, 
Disney is just doing an exceptional job. If it can be marketed, they're going 
to do it. It's probably safe to say that everyone in America will know about 
Dick Tracy. The question is whether they will have a shirt with a tommy gun on 
their chest, or if they will just go to the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Maher, whose archival material is regularly loaned out for use in television 
and movies, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman proved to manufacturers that Dick Tracy can work," said the collector, 
wearing an oversize Tracy T-shirt. "There's even a car that might be this 
year's equivalent to the Batmobile. Even if the reviews are bad, it's 
automatic. And this Tracy is a mysterious guy, in a sense a modern-day 
vigilante out to stop all the nonsense in town. He's more of a person than 
Superman or Batman. He reminds me almost of a Peter Falk-like character, only 
with class. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see a lot happening with this. There's going to be a whole line of Dick 
Tracy cars, and I'll bet you there's going to be a Dick Tracy trench coat, hat, 
watch, two-way wrist-radio. The merchandising that you see right now is just 
the beginning of it." 
</P>
<P>
But it is the be-all and end-all of bachelor Maher's existence, really -- the 
stuff that keeps people such as him and Doucet in the business of collecting. 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting," he said, "all relates to a part of a person that we all wish we'd 
kept, and kept alive. That's the one thing Peter Pan had, in a sense. He was 
able to know how to keep that going and not lose it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 13 years old, I felt stupid with all my collection of Beany and 
Cecil stuff and Shari Lewis hand puppets. So I took it all to a swap meet and 
sold it for 50 bucks and got a transistor radio, felt really cool for a while 
with that transistor radio. Now I hate myself for having done that." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that he's compensated for the error in judgment. A few of his most 
prized Tracy items: 
</P>
<P>
* The Dick Tracy Siren Pistol -- "There were a number of different guns," Maher 
said. "I've seen others, but never this one." The heavy tin revolver, which 
sounds like a ray-gun from a Daffy Duck cartoon and probably dates to the late 
'40s, goes for "maybe a thousand -- maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
* Dick Tracy (squirting) Machine Gun -- in a box proclaiming, "Shoots over 500 
shots in one fill!" with Dick's cartooned head saying "Okay, boys, let's get 
goin' and stop or I'll shoot!" "There have been thousands of these made in the 
early '50s," said Maher, "but it has to survive, to get to this point in 1990. 
It has to make it through all those years! That's the fun of getting something 
in mint condition. The box is in mint condition, and the product itself has 
never been squirted! Found it at a collector's show, and to me, it's like a 
crown jewel. You put this in a case." 
</P>
<P>
* Junior and Dick Tracy salt-and-pepper shakers from the mid-'40s. 
</P>
<P>
* A Big Little Book entitled "Dick Tracy Encounters Facey." 
</P>
<P>
* A Dick Tracy Two-Way Wrist Radio from the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
* A Dick Tracy Golden Book. "This simple little Golden Book -- 60 bucks," said 
Maher proudly. "You won't find it at any shows." 
</P>
<P>
Maher, who has played host at tributes to everyone from the late 
animator/puppeteer Bob Clampett to Vance Colvig (L.A.'s Bozo the Clown in the 
early '60s), the late Jay Ward, and Jimmy Weldon (father of Webster Webfoot), 
speaks of his Tracy-ana and the rest of his archives in the expert tones of an 
art appraiser -- handling the toys and irreplaceable memorabilia with downright 
reverence. They are, after all, his business as well as his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
But it goes beyond business. There is love in his voice as he shows his 
original animation cels of Bugs Bunny (autographed by Fritz Freleng), his 
Movieola projector owned by Walt Disney in the 1920s, his thousands of dolls, 
toys, mugs, hand puppets of every character from Crusader Rabbit to Lambchop, 
his taped interviews with legendary Southern California kiddie-show hosts 
Sheriff John, Engineer Bill, Walker Edmiston and Tom Hatten, his Oscar Meyer 
Wiener Wagon model autographed by "Little Oscar" himself, Jerry Marrin. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at TV for a second and say, 'God, I haven't seen that since I 
was a kid!' what does that do to you?" said Maher, who so loves television that 
he has one in just about every room -- including a small set mounted on the 
bathroom wall for shower-viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"Your memory is important," he continued. "As a kid you look at that record 
jacket of something like 'Bozo on the Farm,' and it's important! You look at it 
maybe a hundred or a thousand times. Now, after all these years that it's been 
erased from your memory, you suddenly see it here, and it's 'Wow, I had that!' 
</P>
<P>
"And when people come into this room, there's such a mixture of different 
times! I'll have people as old as my grandpa see a Dick Tracy car and say 'Oh 
my God, I had one of those!', and I've had kids come in here and go right to 
the Ninja Turtle dolls and go 'Ohhhhh. I haven't seen those.' And the Dick 
Tracy car doesn't mean anything to them." 
</P>
<P>
A Dick Tracy car having no meaning to a child? Those days, it's safe to say, 
are over.

RIDING A GIANT ELEVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hot is hot, but the San Francisco Giants confronted a stark truth Wednesday: It 
is difficult to win on only three hits in 11 innings. They gave it a try but 
lost to the San Diego Padres, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Giants have lost two consecutive games after winning nine in a 
row and 16 of 17. Momentum works both ways. It's the nature of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Giants' resilience will be tested again. It seems to be the 
nature of their season. Charles Dickens would love it. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing these guys will be able to say about 1990 is that we saw the worst 
of it and we saw the best of it," Manager Roger Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still say that to come back the way we have is unbelievable. I don't think 
I've ever been with a club that's done it to the same extent." 
</P>
<P>
The National League's defending champions are still 8 1/2 games behind the 
Cincinnati Reds in the West, but as catcher Terry Kennedy noted, "If we hadn't 
come back the way we did, we'd be 17 out and the summer would be over." 
</P>
<P>
What the Giants have come back from with their 16-3 June -- the 1965 team set 
the club record for victories in a month with 21 in September -- is a series of 
injuries and a stumbling start that undoubtedly sent tremors through the 
nervous faithful. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants were 17-29 on May 28 and 14 1/2 games behind the Reds, which is why, 
with 95 games remaining and that deficit cut almost in half, they can now say 
that progress is their most important commodity. 
</P>
<P>
And it is also why they believe they can continue to compete, to close in, 
despite continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of their pitching. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have already employed 21 pitchers, including 11 starters. They have 
used the disabled list 12 times and currently have five pitchers on it, 
including three of the spring's original starters -- Rick Reuschel, Kelly Downs 
and Mike LaCoss -- and spot starter Atlee Hammaker. 
</P>
<P>
There is no certainty about when, or if, any will return. Nor is it certain 
that Don Robinson, 2-0 in five starts since leaving the disabled list May 22, 
will continue to be available. Robinson, Craig said, is "a walking time bomb" 
because of an arthritic knee. 
</P>
<P>
How did the Giants produce a June boom at a time when they seemed headed for a 
continuing swoon? 
</P>
<P>
Craig cited an elixir of new blood as represented by John Burkett, 25, and 
Trevor Wilson, 24, who have helped hold the rotation together with a combined 
record of 10-1, and right fielder Rick Parker, 27, who is hitting .333 since 
Kevin Bass went on the 60-day disabled list because of knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids came in and picked everybody up," Craig said, "but I also think that 
our veterans never lost faith. We won in '87 and '89, and they knew in the back 
of their minds that we could play better, even with all of the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It also helps to have as good a defense as there is in the league. We make 
double plays out of balls other teams don't even catch. Our defense makes the 
pitching that much better." 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there's the modern Murderers Row of Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and 
Matt Williams, who are on a pace to drive in 100 or more runs apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants entered Wednesday's game leading the league in both hits and runs 
while averaging 7.1 runs a game in June with a .326 team batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"With those three guys in the middle of the lineup, you've got to decide who 
you're going to pitch to, who's going to beat you," Giant batting coach Dusty 
Baker said. "Once that doubt creeps into the pitcher's and manager's minds, 
they're dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great. It's like it was in Los Angeles when we had Garv (Steve Garvey), 
Reggie (Smith), Ron Cey and myself in the middle of the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Only death and taxes are automatic. Clark and Mitchell were up with runners in 
scoring position in the late innings of a tie game Wednesday and failed. 
Williams' 16-game hitting streak ended as the Giants wasted effective pitching 
by Burkett and Jeff Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, the San Diego manager, said later that he thinks the Padres, 
Giants and Dodgers are all still alive, that neither the Giants nor anyone else 
is likely to rip off another 16 of 17, that what he is still looking for is the 
consistency his team showed in winning 29 of their last 39 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric was stronger in other parts of the clubhouse. There is bad blood 
between the Padres and Giants, stemming from the broken arm suffered by San 
Diego catcher Benito Santiago when hit by a Brantley pitch last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who have hit only four other batters all season, have hit five 
Padres in the last 30 innings, and Roberto Alomar attempted to discuss the 
matter with Burkett after being grazed on the hand by a pitch in the seventh 
inning Wednesday. Benches emptied, but it was a typical waltz, and there was no 
retaliation on the part of San Diego pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't the time, but that time will come," Padre outfielder Joe Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said: "I didn't think Alomar even got hit. If we're going to throw at 
guys, we'll do a better job of it than that." 
</P>
<P>
The bemused Giants seemed to think that with all their talk -- before, during 
and after the series -- the Padres were looking for something to rally around 
and, Brett Butler said, "showing more frustration than validity." 
</P>
<P>
What seems valid is that the Giants, despite these last two losses, are back in 
a race they won last year and appeared out of two weeks ago. They have 15 games 
left with the Reds and are 3-0 against them. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about Cincinnati," Craig said. "We've got to play our game the 
way we have been. We're not going to win every game, we're not going to win 
nine out of every 10, but if we win two out of every three, we'll have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We need our young pitchers to hold up and we need one more solid starter. I'm 
looking for a miracle. I'm looking for just one of our injured pitchers to come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying for it. I'm begging for it."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS STEINBRENNER DEAL HELPED PRODUCE A WORLD SERIES TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever you do to celebrate the summer solstice, don't call up New York Yankee 
owner George Steinbrenner and say, "Happy anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
One year ago today, New York traded Rickey Henderson to the Oakland Athletics 
for Greg Cadaret, Eric Plunk and Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What school has produced the most NBA rookies of the year? 
</P>
<P>
Don't touch that dial: Ever wonder what thousands of Southern California 
baseball fans, who followed the Dodgers on KFI in 1960 through '74, must think 
when they see the station's latest billboard and bus advertising campaign? The 
signs say: 
</P>
<P>
WANNA DODGE BASEBALL? 
</P>
<P>
KFI 640 
</P>
<P>
MORE Stimulating TALK RADIO 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, they're probably right. When you think about it, listening to Tom Leykis 
chew out a housewife in West Covina is much more stimulating than anything that 
happened while KFI had the Dodgers: four National League championships and two 
World Series championships, Maury Wills' 104 stolen bases in 1962, Sandy 
Koufax's perfect game in 1965, Don Drysdale's 58 2/3 consecutive shutout 
innings in 1968. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute: Glenn Dickey, the San Francisco Chronicle columnist, writes in 
Inside Sports' July NFL preview that the word unstoppable is "usually not 
bandied about the National Football League, the birthplace of parity and 8-8 
playoff teams." 
</P>
<P>
A check of "The National Football League Record and Fact Book" shows that since 
the NFL began its 16-game regular-season format in 1978, only one 8-8 team, the 
1985 Cleveland Browns, has made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
School figures: Richard L. Shook of UPI asks: "Does any high school whose 
graduates play in the major leagues have more home runs than Nogales High?" 
Shook notes that Detroit's Cecil Fielder and Mark Salas both attended Nogales. 
Their total is 30 -- Fielder 25, Salas 5. 
</P>
<P>
Sign of the times: The Associated Press reported this week that the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., has called off the autograph session that 
has been part of its induction ceremonies since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the session has been suspended for 1990. But don't count on a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, crowds lining up for signatures of returning Hall of Famers 
have grown to 2,000. Village residents have complained of property damage 
caused by fans who spent the night outside the hotel where the event was held. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hall of Fame's main concern is staying out of the collectibles game. 
Said Bill Guilfoile, the shrine's associate director: "We felt more and more 
people in line were dealers and youngsters getting autographs for dealers to 
sell rather than for their own gratification." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: North Carolina, with four: Bob McAdoo (Buffalo, 1972-73); Walter 
Davis (Phoenix, 1977-78); Phil Ford (Kansas City, 1978-79); Michael Jordan 
(Chicago, 1984-85).

BIG WEST ENDS TV CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
CONFLICT: PRIME TICKET'S DEMANDS TO CHANGE GAME TIMES PROMPT ACTION TO TRY TO 
CUT LOSSES AT THE GATE.

The Big West Conference, concerned about requests for changes in starting times 
and about television's effects on attendance, was released from the final year 
of its contract with Prime Ticket Network and is negotiating elsewhere, network 
and conference officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket televised more than 130 hours of Big West events during the past 
year that included football, basketball, softball, baseball and volleyball. It 
was the second of a three-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Prime Ticket, which serves 4.1 million subscribers in Southern California, 
Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii, had increasingly requested that starting times of 
games be changed to avoid conflicts with its higher-priority programming. 
</P>
<P>
"As we continued to increase the number of King games, Laker games, Pac-10 and 
UCLA and USC games, in order to fit the Big West into the package we had to 
continue to ask them to move starting times and kickoff times," said John 
Severino, Prime Ticket president. "(The Big West) came to us and said the 
athletic directors were aggravated about the starting times and would we let 
them out. So we let them out." 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel L.A., which is in 130,000 households, is a possible replacement 
to carry Big West events. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in very serious conversation with them," said Lynn Woodard, general 
manager of SportsChannel L.A. "I think the Big West would be an extremely 
valuable addition to SportsChannel's fall and winter programming lineup." 
</P>
<P>
The Big West, so eager to attract television coverage that it changed its name 
from Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. in 1988 partly to fit ESPN's Big Monday 
basketball program, has found that television coverage can also have 
disadvantages for a conference still struggling in some areas, particularly in 
football attendance at schools such as Cal State Long Beach and Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at those schools is an issue because of NCAA requirements for 
Division I-A football status calling for five of the conference's eight schools 
to average 17,000 at home or 20,000 for all games at least once every four 
years.

YANKEES HEAD NORTH WITH MODEST STREAK, AMBITIOUS GOALS 
</P>

<P>
After overcoming a four-run deficit Wednesday in their 5-4 victory over the 
Brewers, the New York Yankees will take aim at another deficit. This one is 
even larger. The Yankees' focus is now a little farther north -- geographically 
and in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, here they come. Whether the Yankees can get out of last place is 
another question. They trail the sixth-place Baltimore Orioles by six games. 
</P>
<P>
At least the 23-40 Yankees proved here that comebacks are in their repertoire. 
For the second time in 36 tries, they won a game they were losing after seven 
innings. Yes, they demonstrated that a four-run deficit is not insurmountable. 
A pair of two-run rallies, followed by Roberto Kelly's high and shallow home 
run with two out in the ninth, were enough to conquer the fifth-place Brewers 
for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees arrived Wednesday night in Toronto, where there is an opportunity 
to erase the embarrassment of their lost weekend and perhaps move a little 
closer to the first-place Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely an opportunity," Don Mattingly said. "I don't think we can go 
in there and realistically think sweep. It's definitely an opportunity to get 
hurt. If we play like we did against them at home, we could get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, realism has not been lost. One exciting victory full of clutch hits 
and a two-game winning streak may be a confidence boost, but looking at the 
standings, which show them 13 1/2 games behind, still sobers them. Wednesday's 
game could have only helped, however. After the Brewers took a 4-0 lead against 
Jimmy Jones in the third inning, the Yankees used two-run innings in the fourth 
and eighth to put Kelly into position to become a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly was not thinking home run -- not even after he hit reliever Chuck Crim's 
high-and-away fastball toward the right-field corner. "I thought it was just a 
deep fly ball," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rob Deer kept drifting into the corner. Finally, he ran out of room and the 
ball landed just over him. It was Kelly's third home run this year and his 
first since moving into the leadoff role 10 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great coming back the way we did today," Kelly said. "It's a good sign we 
haven't given up. I don't think we can come to the park thinking things are 
hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Barfield said, "We've got a lot of teams to jump over but we're not out 
of it until it's over. It's a big win for us. We don't want to go into Toronto 
down. They're playing good ball and they embarrassed us last time." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees' confidence was a little higher against the 30-34 Brewers, losers 
of 20 of their past 28 games. "There was no way they were going to beat us -- 
this is what we were saying up and down the bench," said Stump Merrill, now 5-9 
as manager. 
</P>
<P>
No, but the Brewers nearly tied it against Lee Guetterman in the ninth. With 
one out, Jim Gantner singled. Merrill went to the mound but stayed with 
Guetterman. "I wanted a ground ball," Merrill explained. 
</P>
<P>
What he got was controversy. On the pitch Guetterman (4-2) struck out Dale 
Sveum for the second out, pinch runner Darryl Hamilton stole second. Barely. 
Second-base umpire Tim McClelland received an animated argument from Steve Sax, 
who thought he applied the tag in time, as well as from shortstop Wayne 
Tolleson and Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more emotion than anything," Tolleson said. "We ain't been on the right 
side of too many (calls)." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees got a reprieve when Sax neatly scooped up Gary Sheffield's grounder 
to his left. Wait a minute. The grass was wet. "When Sax slipped," Merrill 
said, "my heart went to my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sax regained his balance in time to get Sheffield by a step. As for the 
Yankees, it was only a second step on a journey with 99 games to go.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WITH CANSECO DOWN, A'S STEINBACH STEPS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Steinbach of the Oakland Athletics has been the leading vote getter among 
catchers for the All-Star game all season. Until recently, the votes were for 
past performance, not for this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Steinbach, who has had three big seasons behind the plate for the World 
Series champions, is known for coming through when needed. 
</P>
<P>
When Jose Canseco went out with a back injury, Steinbach was batting .190 and 
had driven in only 12 runs. But in the last 13 games Steinbach has helped to 
make up for the loss of the A's top slugger. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach hit a grand slam and drove in six runs Wednesday at Detroit as the 
Athletics salvaged the final game of the series with the Tigers, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire also homered for the Athletics who made it easy for Bob Welch 
(11-2) to win his eighth consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
Welch gave up six hits and one earned run in six innings before turning the 
chore over to the bullpen with a 12-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With Canseco, who may return Saturday, out of the lineup, Steinbach has batted 
.417, hit two home runs and driven in 14 runs. He has raised his average to 
.246. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned that we had to pick it up when Canseco was out the first half of 
last season," Steinbach said. "We all seem to take turns doing the job. We have 
quite a few guys who can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Just before Canseco went out, Manager Tony LaRussa wanted to give his catcher a 
rest. Except for two games in which he has pinch-hit, Steinbach has either been 
the catcher or the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
He was the DH for this game because Ron Hassey is the regular catcher for 
Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"He came ready to go," Hassey said of Welch. "I think he realized in the two 
previous games he didn't have his best stuff. Today he was in control." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 11, Boston 0 -- The Blue Jays restored their lead in the East to two 
games, but the game at Toronto was closer than it looks. 
</P>
<P>
When Tom Henke, in relief of Dave Stieb (10-2), struck out Dwight Evans to end 
the eighth inning, Evans was the potential tying run. 
</P>
<P>
But the Blue Jays scored eight runs in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth inning, at the request of Boston Manager Joe Morgan, umpire Larry 
Barnett examined Stieb's hat and glove and inspected the ball but found no 
evidence of tampering. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb, who gave up eight hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out seven and didn't 
walk a batter. He lowered his league-leading ERA to 2.26. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Milwaukee 4 -- Early this month, the Brewers were leading the East. 
They are slumping so badly that this was their second loss in a row at home to 
the woeful Yankees, who have the worst record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees trailed, 4-2, and had only six singles off former Dodger Dennis 
Powell when they rallied in the eighth to tie. Jesse Barfield singled in the 
tying run. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, with two out, Roberto Kelly hit a high fly to left that the wind 
carried into the seats just inside the flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a routine out," losing pitcher Chuck Crim said. "I was 
walking to the dugout. I thought the inning was over." 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers are 5-12 in the last 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 3, Cleveland 1 -- Randy Milligan scored the Orioles' first run after 
a single in the fifth inning at Cleveland, then won it with his 11th home run 
in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Harnisch (7-3) gave up only five hits in eight innings. Gregg Olson, a 
loser Tuesday night, struck out two of the three batters he faced in the ninth 
to register his 15th save in 16 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The loser was Jesse Orosco (3-3), who relieved Tom Candiotti in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, Kansas City 2 -- Ken Griffey hit an inside-the-park home run with 
two out in the fifth inning to break a 2-2 tie at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey lined an opposite-field drive to the base of the wall in left field 
that caromed past Jim Eisenreich some 90 feet toward center. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Holman (8-5), who has been struggling, pitched a strong eight innings to 
win it. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 8, Minnesota 0 -- Kevin Brown (9-4) pitched a four-hitter at Arlington, 
Tex., for his first shutout to give the Rangers a three-game series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Geno Petralli broke out of a four-for-31 slump with a two-run double in the 
first inning and the Rangers were never headed. 
</P>
<P>
The slumping Twins have lost 12 of their last 13 games. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PIRATES REEL AS EXPOS, METS, PHILLIES MAKE UP GROUND IN THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just two weeks ago Manager Jim Leyland and his Pittsburgh Pirates had a solid 
lead in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe even more important, there were no signs the team Leyland feared most, 
the New York Mets, who had made a managerial change, were ready to wake up. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Pirates appear to be in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
When journeyman left-hander Bruce Ruffin (5-6) stopped them cold Wednesday at 
Philadelphia, and the Phillies rolled to a 7-2 victory, the situation became 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Expos are only 1 1/2 games behind the Pirates, the sizzling Mets 
and the surprising Phillies are only four games behind and Pittsburgh pitcher 
Bob Walk is out at least 15 days with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin, who came into this season with a 32-38 record, pitched his second solid 
game in a row. He gave up five hits and both runs in eight innings. Len Dykstra 
led the Phillie attack. He was two for three to raise his major league-leading 
average to .384. He scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We stink," the angry Leyland said. "Ruffin pitched good, but we stink. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hitting, the pitching isn't very good and we're playing sloppy 
defense. We can't hold onto the lead playing that way." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla provided the only Pirate punch. He hit his 16th home run and a 
double, scoring both runs. 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, St. Louis 3 -- Kevin McReynolds hit a three-run home run in the 
first inning. The Mets have hit home runs in eight consecutive games and have 
cut the Pirates' lead from 9 1/2 games to four since June 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal players called a clubhouse meeting that lasted 25 minutes after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The players closed the doors," Manager Whitey Herzog said. "I had nothing to 
do with it. We still aren't hitting and we're making bad pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman stole two bases for the Cardinals and is 56 for 56 against the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 9, Atlanta 8 -- Billy Hatcher singled in the winning run in the 10th 
inning at Atlanta to give the Reds their seventh victory in the last eight 
games and an 8 1/2-game lead in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds scored a run in each of the last three innings to come from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan walked, was sacrificed to second and scored on Hatcher's hit. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Chicago 2 -- The Expos had only three hits and trailed, 2-0, at 
Montreal when Larry Walker appeared to strike out to end the seventh inning. 
But catcher Joe Girardi missed the pitch, the Expos rallied for three runs and 
Greg Maddux was a tough loser. DAN HAFNER

<P>
JACK CHARLTON STILL A PICTURE OF CUP SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
IRELAND: STANDOUT PLAYER ON ENGLAND'S 1966 CHAMPIONS HAS COACHED THE IRISH INTO 
CONTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
FLORENCE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is one of the most memorable and, indeed, poignant photographs in World Cup 
history. It shows a player on his knees on the turf, his face buried in his 
hands. The emotion it conveys is almost palpable. 
</P>
<P>
The shot was taken at Wembley Stadium in London on the afternoon of July 30, 
1966, the day that England defeated West Germany, 4-2, in overtime, to win the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The player in the picture is Jack Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
"I suddenly realized that I was knackered (exhausted, to use a more polite 
euphemism)," Charlton said years later in explaining the photograph. "Really 
knackered. I sank on my knees and put my head in my hands. A sort of, 'Thank 
God that's over.' People reckon I said a little prayer, but I don't think I 
actually said a conscious prayer. It was just relief at the end of two hours of 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the photograph dramatically captures the pressures of 
playing in the World Cup and its effect on those involved. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Charlton and his more famous brother, Bobby, helped England win the 
trophy for the first and so far only time. In 1990, "Big Jack" is trying to do 
the same for Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
An Englishman coaching the Irish might seem an unlikely, almost incongruous, 
situation, but there are all sorts of twists in this English lion's tale. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Charlton is looked upon almost as a saint in the republic after 
leading Ireland into both the European Championships in 1988 and the World Cup 
this year for the first time in its history. For another, he genuinely likes 
the Irish and has developed a true rapport with the country's soccer 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't win the World Cup, then I would like England to be the champions," 
Charlton told fans in Dublin before the team left for Italy, then paused just 
long enough before adding: "But they'll do it over our dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since Charlton took over as Ireland's coach in February 1986, the 
English have found the Irish a particularly troublesome opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland played England in the first round of the European Championships in West 
Germany in 1988 and scored a memorable 1-0 upset victory. The teams met again 
10 days ago in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia, this time in World Cup play, 
and the Irish earned a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Beating England in West Germany was the high point of Ireland's soccer history 
so far," British soccer reporter Peter Ball wrote just before the World Cup, 
"and Charlton was virtually canonized on the spot by the traveling Irish fans 
and feted almost unbelievably when the side returned home, confirming his 
status as an honorary Irishman. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still critics who do not love his approach to the game, but his 
rapport with fans is tremendous, and when Ireland qualified (for the World 
Cup), an emotional Charlton joined the celebrating fans in the streets and the 
bars as they drank the night away." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, England and Ireland have since been drawn together for the third 
time in a row in international competition and will meet in the qualifying 
rounds of the 1992 European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the focus is on the World Cup and, in particular, on today's match 
in Palermo, Sicily, between Ireland and the Netherlands. Odds favor the Dutch, 
but this has been a World Cup of upsets, and there is one other factor to 
remember: Charlton has never lost a World Cup match as a player or as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
As the second-oldest player on England's 1966 team, Charlton, then 29, played 
in and won six games. Inexplicably, he played in only one match in the 1970 
World Cup in Mexico, but England won that game, too. Now, at 54, he has coached 
Ireland to consecutive ties against England and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he has been actively involved in the game since signing as a 
16-year-old professional with Leeds United of the English League in 1952, 
Charlton's life revolves around more than soccer. 
</P>
<P>
As Ball wrote, "There is more to Jack Charlton than the Ireland manager would 
like you to think. Behind the bluff, sometimes rough exterior lies a surprising 
sensitivity; but then, behind the decisive, no-nonsense front there is a mass 
of contradictions: a socialist with a taste for shooting and fishing, if not 
hunting." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are times when it seems that Charlton has an even greater passion 
for tramping the moors in search of grouse, a shotgun tucked under his arm, or 
for fly-fishing along some Irish river bank than he has for soccer. He made a 
notable television series on fishing -- and another on soccer coaching -- and 
is a popular television pundit and after-dinner speaker despite his broad 
north-of-England accent. 
</P>
<P>
But soccer has been his bread and butter for almost four decades. At 6 feet 4 
and gawky, long in neck and stride, he was a soccer-playing giraffe. His height 
helped him be almost unbeatable in the air, however, and it was as a defender 
that he made his mark. 
</P>
<P>
He played a club-record 629 matches for Leeds United, his only club team, and 
appeared 35 times for England. He was named England's player of the year in 
1967 and, after moving into coaching -- first with Middlesbrough, then with 
Sheffield Wednesday and, briefly, with Newcastle United -- he was named 
England's coach of the year in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
But it is with Ireland that Charlton has enjoyed his greatest success. 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A survey by a Scottish soccer magazine, The Punter, late last year ranked 
Ireland ahead of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, based on the 
results of all international matches played since 1986. Ireland, in fact, 
ranked fourth in Europe, behind only the Netherlands, West Germany and Denmark. 
Italy was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coming into the World Cup, the Irish were unbeaten at home in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his first three years as Ireland's coach, Charlton won 13 matches, tied 
seven and lost only five. Small wonder that the Irish Football Assn. was quick 
to renew its agreement with him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a written contract, however. True to character, Charlton works on a 
handshake, a gentlemen's agreement that requires nothing more than the other 
party's word. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one criticism of Charlton, it is that his team's style of play 
tends to be more effective than attractive. This practical approach reflects 
Charlton's temperament. 
</P>
<P>
The best example of Ireland's style was shown in the match against England. The 
Irish were quick into every tackle, unafraid of physical contact and aggressive 
for the full 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We inflict our game on other teams -- let them try to handle us," Charlton 
said of Ireland's approach during the World Cup qualifying campaign. So far, it 
has worked, but the future is less certain. 
</P>
<P>
British sports columnist James Mossop has been a close friend of Charlton's for 
almost a quarter-century. In an article in England's Sunday Express on June 10 
he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Charlton is looking to the future, and in two years' time he will be gone from 
the stewardship of the Republic of Ireland team. Retirement calls at 54. 
</P>
<P>
"You would not guess as much from a glance at the training ground where he 
barks instructions with the epithets of the Northumbrian colliery where his 
working life began. He is a tall, bandy-legged figure in baggy shorts, vest, 
dark glasses and the kind of tweed cap favored by pigeon fanciers and 
rat-catchers." 
</P>
<P>
The image is almost like something out of D.H. Lawrence, and Charlton, in fact, 
does come across as the no-nonsense northerner -- gruff, blunt and sparing no 
punches -- that Lawrence favored. 
</P>
<P>
Added Mossop: "Jack is a straightforward, uncomplicated person who will say 
exactly what he thinks. Usually instantly." 
</P>
<P>
This, Charlton believes, might have cost him any chance at becoming England's 
coach several years ago. He applied, but never heard back from the English 
Football Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they didn't think I was couth enough or that my image was right," he 
told Mossop. "I have a reputation for being outspoken. I do not consider myself 
a diplomat, but there are too many diplomats knocking about in the game." 
</P>
<P>
And so tonight, instead of guiding England's fortunes against Egypt in 
Cagliari, Charlton will be in Palermo, hoping to upstage the English by beating 
the Dutch. It's unlikely to happen, but Charlton will be there by choice. 
</P>

"I love the Irish people and the job," he said. "At this moment, I have no 
ambition other than managing the Irish team. I know the time will come when I 
will get the feeling that I should go and someone else should have a crack at 
it. You can spend too much time in a job." 
</P>
<P>
A postscript: On Nov. 15, 1989, in front of 25,000 fans, one-fifth of them 
Irish, at Ta Qali National Stadium in Valletta, Malta, Ireland defeated Malta, 
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was historic. Ireland had been trying for 56 years to reach the 
World Cup but had failed in its previous 12 attempts. Charlton got it right the 
first time as Ireland finished second to Spain in its qualifying group, which 
also included Hungary and Malta. 
</P>
<P>
"The satisfaction for me is doing the job I was paid to do in the first place," 
Charlton said afterward. "When I took over (as coach), it was made clear that 
the main aim was to qualify for the (24-team) finals. 
</P>
<P>
"The European Championship was nice, and we've upgraded our game and caused 
people a few problems over the years. But I'm glad it's over. We've had two 
very difficult years and we've had to win a few games when the pressure has 
been on. But (the players) have done that, and it's absolutely terrific that 
Ireland is in the finals for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
That said, Charlton made his exit. His roots and his heart lie with the players 
and the fans, not the sportswriters and the television cameras. It was a night 
to celebrate, and as he left, Charlton tossed one last comment back over his 
shoulder: "The lads are singing, and I want to join them." 
</P>
<P>
Those 10 words, as well as any, illustrate what Jack Charlton is all about.

Brazil and Scotland played to their histories Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, three-time World Cup champions, edged the Scots, who have never 
made it past the first round in six previous visits to the tournament, 1-0. A 
tie would have virtually assured Scotland a place in the final 16. 
</P>
<P>
And Brazil, which looked uninspired for much of the second half, pounced on a 
mistake, as it almost always does. 
</P>
<P>
Muller scored with nine minutes remaining, poking the ball into an unguarded 
net after goalkeeper Jim Leighton could not control a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil proved in each game that it has personality," Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni 
said. "I know this team has quality. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil got another win because the players worked hard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
So did the Scots, who were confident of tying the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the whole second half the game would progress into a draw," Coach Andy 
Roxburgh said. "Then, suddenly, it was gone." 
</P>
<P>
So, probably, are Scotland's chances of moving on. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players gave everything they had," Roxburgh said. "They battled away, but 
Brazil has real class. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that if we didn't get a point, we wouldn't qualify." 
</P>
<P>
Leighton made a save on a shot by Alemao, but the rebound came to a charging 
Careca. He nudged it toward the goal and past Leighton. Muller, free at the 
right of the net, did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which already had qualified, ended the first round 3-0. Surprising 
Costa Rica, which beat Sweden, 2-1, finished second with four points. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland ended up third with two points, not likely to be enough to advance. 
But the Scots must wait for today's results, the final four games of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having the majority of possession, the Brazilians did not create many 
chances and found Leighton in fine form. 
</P>
<P>
The goalkeeper's best saves came against Ricardo Gomes in the 24th minute, 
Romario's header in the 52nd minute, and again on Romario five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland had a chance to tie in the final minute, but Brazilian goalie Claudio 
Taffarel flicked the ball over the crossbar to keep out a close shot by Maurice 
Johnston.

<P>
NORTH WILL SAIL IN RACE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Audi/North Sails Race Week off Long Beach this weekend will have an extra touch 
of class. Lowell North of San Diego will sail on Tony Reyes' Swan 46 Islero in 
Class D. 
</P>
<P>
Racing among 119 boats in seven classes starts Friday at 4 p.m., with two more 
rounds Saturday and one Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
If sailing has legends, North is one of them: founder of North Sails, Olympic 
gold medalist in 1968, the only four-time Star class world champion -- and a 
man without an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
North recently had a second hip transplant but is getting around on crutches. 
His first operation didn't stop him from going to the America's Cup at 
Fremantle, Australia, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the best American match racers are named Isler. 
</P>
<P>
J.J. Isler, wife of Peter Isler, won the first international women's 
match-racing championship at Portofino, Italy, early this month. With eight 
teams from five countries competing in J-24s, she sailed through the double 
round-robin, 14-0, then blitzed the sail-offs, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
That stirred up talk around San Diego that she might become the skipper of one 
of the two proposed women's America's Cup efforts, competing against her 
husband for the right to defend the Cup. She has beaten men in open events. 
</P>
<P>
But one America's Cup campaign in the family is enough. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Cup were in '93, I would have tried to sign on with Peter's campaign," 
she said. "But (with both in '92), it would take too much away from my Olympic 
campaign. I really want to do that again." 
</P>
<P>
J.J. Isler, sailing a 470 dinghy with crew Amy Wardell, was fifth in the 1988 
U.S. trials won by Allison Jolly and Lynne Jewell, who went on to win the first 
women's Olympic gold medal in sailing. 
</P>
<P>
At Portofino, Isler's five-person crew included her sister, Margi Fetter. J.J. 
Isler is a former captain of the Yale sailing team and was Rolex yachtswoman of 
the year in 1987, the same year Dennis Conner won the men's award for 
reclaiming the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's crew came up one man short before the final day of last weekend's 
match-racing series against Peter Isler on San Diego Bay when the key sail 
trimmer, Grant Loretz, became ill early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Isler, already down in races, 4-1, and in points, 6-1, gave rival David Barnes 
one of his extra sailors, Gordy Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
What's this, an outbreak of sportsmanship in the America's Cup? 
</P>
<P>
Isler was the navigator for Conner on the Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran in the 
lopsided 1988 defense that wound up in a storm of name-calling at the bitter 
news conferences after the two races. Isler sat silent and embarrassed at one 
end of the podium as Conner swapped insults with New Zealand's Barnes, 
tactician Peter Lester and designer Bruce Farr. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember J.J. cornering David (Barnes) right afterward and having a word 
with him to try to defuse anything there," Isler said. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt bad that all the sailors on both teams had to take part in the races. 
For me personally, it was a fun, positive learning experience, except that we 
had to go race in the end. The racing wasn't any fun for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't hear them talking about it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Isler shouldn't have lost any ground with potential backers with his 
performance against the tough New Zealanders last weekend. He came back strong 
Sunday to win the first two races and tie the series, then lost by a big margin 
after switching to the blue-hulled Swiftsure III, alias Soft Scrub. 
</P>
<P>
Isler wouldn't listen to the excuse, but several observers thought the white 
boat -- Hokelele, alias Coor's Light -- was faster upwind in a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Isler, the top-ranked U.S. match racer and fourth in the world, was most 
impressive in his starts -- a critical factor in match racing. He got off the 
line seven out of eight times in better position than three-time Congressional 
Cup winner Rod Davis, who handled the starts for New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"Isler is the best starter in match racing right now," said his tactician, Dave 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fay hasn't selected his skipper for the '92 challenge, but Barnes and 
Davis don't seem uptight about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider it far too early in the game to worry about that," Barnes said. 
"Those sort of things evolve after a while, as long as you've got the right 
sort of people. 
</P>
<P>
"Who exactly steers or who's tactician or navigator is probably not too 
important. We've got any number of people capable of doing the job. It's just a 
matter of who fits in best where. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to think that we can also be man enough to say, 'OK, if you're 
better, you do the job,' rather than letting egos get in the way." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Klein watched Sunday's races from an inflatable dinghy. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, the 1989 Rolex award winner for his J-24 and Etchells 22 world 
championships, has organized his own American's Cup campaign: Triumph America. 
</P>
<P>
Conner didn't watch but seems to be lurking in the wings to make his splash. 
</P>
<P>
Conner is ranked seventh in world match racing -- a distinction he could do 
without. He doesn't compete on the circuit, but his 1988 points for the Cup 
defense still count. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, they don't count enough to rank him on top, which may mislead 
his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Melvin and Steve Rosenberg of Long Beach will sail the Chula Vista Yacht 
Club's challenge in the Little America's Cup for hard-sail C-class catamarans 
in Australia next January. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin sailed a Tornado cat in the 1988 Olympics and, with Rosenberg, won the 
ProSail Hobie 21 title last year. 
</P>
<P>
A Cabrillo Beach YC bid by sailmakers Steve and Brian Dair of San Pedro failed 
last year when a helicopter's downdraft blew apart their fast but fragile 
"Wingmill" and its rotating airfoil as the first race was about to start. 
</P>
<P>
The more conventional Chula Vista boat, designed by Gino Morelli, is being 
built at RD Boatworks in San Juan Capistrano, where the Stars &amp; Stripes 
catamarans were created.

HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS DEFY BUSH ON AID FOR TECH FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Democratic leadership, sensing that President Bush may be vulnerable 
on the issue, Wednesday endorsed a proposal for a sharp increase in federal aid 
to high-technology companies faced with growing overseas competition. 
</P>
<P>
The House Democrats listed as a top legislative priority a plan to allocate 
$400 million during the next three years for grants to match funds spent by 
private technology firms to develop new products or manufacturing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is also backed by Republican lawmakers. In fact, it recently 
was approved 46-0 by the House Science and Technology Committee and is expected 
to be passed soon by the House with bipartisan backing. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, however, has said that it opposes the proposed 
increase in funding for the Advanced Technology Program. The Administration has 
asked Congress to appropriate only $10 million for it. 
</P>
<P>
The technology aid proposal is the centerpiece of a wide-ranging Democratic 
action agenda intended to make the private sector more competitive. The 
Democrats hope that the package will attract support from business interests 
that otherwise tend to line up with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic legislative agenda includes a proposal that would earmark $80 
million a year for defense-related projects to help firms make the transition 
to production of civilian goods as military spending declines. 
</P>
<P>
The package also would increase grants for biotechnology research by about $100 
million a year and set up a $125-million fund in the Export-Import Bank for 
loan guarantees to U.S. companies to promote exports of high-tech products to 
Eastern European democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the package would require the President to submit a five-year 
plan to support high-performance computer technology, change the law to allow 
joint ventures in production and take regulatory steps to encourage development 
of high-definition television. 
</P>
<P>
House Republicans, in a response to the Democratic leadership, said the program 
is far too modest and called for adoption of massive new tax breaks to 
encourage private capital formation without the government setting high-tech 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party yells loud and does nothing," said House Minority Whip 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in a news conference less than three hours after the 
rival party's plan was unveiled by Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and other 
House Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But the GOP lawmakers acknowledged that they had differences with the White 
House over the federal role in assisting U.S. firms to compete against 
high-tech companies in Japan, Europe and elsewhere that have taken a large 
share of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably, as House Republicans, be more intense and more aggressive," 
Gingrich said in discussing differences with the White House on technology 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Congress had to 
act because the Bush Administration was indifferent to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This Administration has no strategy for dealing with high technology or the 
global marketplace," Gephardt said. "And this failure means we're losing. It's 
time that government offered a hand of cooperation to this important industry." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic congressional sources said the overall legislative package had been 
watered down significantly during the five months it was under consideration by 
a task force headed by Gephardt, and Republicans scoffed at the proposals as 
"run-of-the-mill." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Palo Alto), who represents the Silicon Valley area with 
its heavy concentration of technology firms, said Republicans favor a tax 
credit for research and development, a cut in capital gains taxes and 
elimination of double taxation of corporate dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital formation is the key," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Californian, Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose), who endorsed the 
Democratic program, agreed that more should be done, adding: "To be successful 
over the long term, we must establish a permanent research and development tax 
credit. . . . We must also reduce the cost of long-range, productive 
investments -- and that means a lower capital gains tax." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who said he supports federal aid to high-tech firms because of their 
large capital costs and high risk, said the funding decisions should be made by 
scientists or engineers and not by Congress. But, he said, the partisan 
rhetoric would subside and added: "My hope is that after this, we can work 
together."

Penny Stock Investors' Law Advances: The House Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance approved legislation to protect investors who 
buy low-priced "penny stocks" and to crack down on violators of securities 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
One measure would give the SEC more authority to regulate the penny stock 
market and punish manipulative operators. It also would require promoters to 
disclose more information about the stocks and companies they are pushing. Both 
measures now go before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for 
consideration.

S&amp;L FRAUD PROBE 'ANEMIC,' GROUP SAYS

The Bush Administration's "anemic" efforts to prosecute savings and loan fraud 
have resulted in the recovery of less than 2% of the money lost in the "worst 
financial scandal in U.S. history," a consumer group charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen's Congress Watch, an organization founded by activist Ralph 
Nader, estimated that the government's civil and criminal actions have 
recovered only $300 million, while fraud at the more than 440 S&amp;Ls seized 
since early last year amounted to $16.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L fraud have been 
anemic at best, irresponsible at worst," said Sherry Ettleson, an attorney who 
prepared a 23-page report on the issue for the group. 
</P>
<P>
The report, issued at a news conference, comes amid growing Democratic 
criticism of the Administration's prosecution of S&amp;L fraud. Partisan furor 
on the issue has blossomed since the Administration last month said Congress 
would have to provide an additional $30 billion to $50 billion for a second 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to blunt the criticism, President Bush is scheduled 
Friday to address the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
summoned the top federal prosecutors to the meeting at the Justice Department, 
said spokesman Dan Eramian. 
</P>
<P>
The Nader organization faulted the Administration for spending only an 
additional $50 million on pursuing thrift crime, when Congress had authorized 
spending of up to $75 million. The Administration has responded that Congress 
eventually appropriated only $50 million and officials are spending that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
It said the Justice Department is pursuing 891 cases actively, compared to a 
backlog of 6,993 cases. Yet the department has added fewer than half the 425 
additional agents requested by the FBI and only 118 of the 231 assistant U.S. 
attorneys requested by the department's field offices, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the record thus far, there is little evidence that the Bush 
Administration is committed to catching and punishing white-collar criminals 
who largely caused the worst financial scandal in U.S. history," Ettleson 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The group recommended that the Administration spend more on pursuing fraud, 
turn its attention to accountants and lawyers who aided S&amp;L executives in 
committing fraud, and drop its support of proposed legislation that would 
remove the threat of triple damages from civil racketeering suits. 
</P>
<P>
It said Congress should enact legislation that would permit whistle blowers to 
bring suit against alleged S&amp;L criminals on behalf of the government and 
share in the damages if fraud is found to have occurred.

<P>
The government put 14 of its largest savings and loans, including Mercury 
Savings in Huntington Beach, up for sale on Wednesday as part of its ongoing 
effort to speed up the disposition of large problem thrifts it has seized. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the government's attempt to fetch a premium price for another of 
its largest thrifts, Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley, is running into trouble 
because three parties that at one time were among the most interested potential 
acquirers chose not to bid. Sources identified the three as Citicorp, 
BankAmerica and Toronto-based Royal Trustco, which owns Pacific First Bank in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The list of prospective buyers for Gibraltar is now believed to be limited to 
three parties, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Security Pacific and Great Western 
Financial. Golden West Financial, the Oakland-based parent of World Savings, 
looked at Gibraltar, but thrift executives said they would be surprised if it 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Gibraltar, which was seized 15 months ago, could be an indicator of 
how well the government will do in selling its largest troubled thrifts. Thrift 
bidders are enjoying a buyer's market, which does not bode well for the 
government's efforts to get healthy prices. Bids for Gibraltar -- which has 
$7.2 billion in assets, $5.7 billion in deposits and 83 branches -- were due 
Tuesday, with an announcement of a winner expected by June 29. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 thrifts put up for sale Wednesday by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., 
the agency charged with selling failed thrifts, have a total of $39.8 billion 
in assets and $31.3 billion in deposits. Eight have assets of more than $1 
billion, including such large institutions as City Savings Bank in Bedminster, 
N.J.; Empire of America in Buffalo, N.Y.; Merabank in Phoenix, and Benjamin 
Franklin Savings in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is under increased pressure to speed the sale of large thrifts it 
controls. It is also under criticism that it has let some large thrifts, such 
as Gibraltar, deteriorate in value by running them under government supervision 
for too long. 
</P>
<P>
"They have got to start getting rid of them," said Alexandria, Va., thrift 
consultant Bert Ely. 
</P>
<P>
An RTC spokeswoman said the agency hopes to sell the thrifts by year-end. 
Mercury is the only California thrift of the 14 for sale, although Empire of 
America has a California operation based in Woodland Hills known for ads that 
once featured Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
Some institutions, including Mercury and Ben Franklin, were taken over only 
this year. Regulators, who have taken years to sell thrifts, are moving quickly 
on these S&amp;Ls because "there is real good franchise value, and the quicker 
we sell them, the higher value we'll realize," said Kevin Shields, an RTC 
spokesman in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Mercury, which has $2.2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in 
deposits, Feb. 23 after it ran out of capital under the tough standards imposed 
by last year's thrift rescue law. The federal law, designed to bail out the 
industry's deposit insurance system, put several hundred marginal thrifts under 
water with its new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury had been reeling for more than a year from accounting errors and 
adjustments it had to take. It lost $53.6 million in the last two years and 
started this year by announcing that two major commercial loans went sour, 
wiping out the institution's already weakened capital. It's now in 
receivership. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts speculated that Mercury, as well as a few other 
multibillion-dollar thrifts up for sale, has strong sale prospects because of 
its good branch network with solid deposits from loyal customers who live near 
the branches. 
</P>
<P>
Those deposits generally cost less -- a lower interest rate is offered -- than 
large certificates of deposit brought in from money brokers or from thrifts' 
own money-gathering desks. And healthy financial institutions are looking more 
for low-cost deposits than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"The main draw is deposits," said James F. Wilson, an analyst with Montgomery 
Securities in San Francisco. "There's no deposit growth out there in most 
markets, as far as internal generation of deposits goes. You have to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Mercury's co-founder and chairman, Leonard Shane, used novel approaches to 
round up local deposit customers and never relied on higher-cost brokered 
funds. That should make the institution's 24 branches appealing, the analysts 
said. 
</P>

Travelers Quits Nine States: Travelers Corp., which is pulling out of 
California's auto insurance market and has stopped writing new auto policies in 
Pennsylvania, announced that it would also stop offering auto and homeowner 
insurance in nine other states as part of a plan to focus on markets with the 
most potential. The nine states are South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Wyoming, West Virginia, Nevada, Idaho, Arkansas and Oklahoma. A Travelers 
statement suggested that the company wants out of states where it believes 
long-term profitability prospects are poor.

CAMPEAU'S '89 LOSS BALLOONS TO $1.7 BILLION

<P>
Financially distressed Campeau Corp. lost $1.7 billion last year, a huge 
deterioration from 1988's deficit of $34 million, the Canadian company reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the firm's loss -- $958 million -- resulted from writing 
down the goodwill of one of Toronto-based Campeau's U.S. retail divisions, 
Federated Department Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Federated and Allied -- whose stores include Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; 
Straus and Jordan Marsh -- have been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
the United States since January. The companies have a combined debt load of 
$7.7 billion, most of which was incurred when financier Robert Campeau took 
them over using high-interest junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
With their heavy interest payments suspended under Chapter 11, pressure on the 
Cincinnati-based units has eased and they reported stronger than expected 
first-quarter results Tuesday. Pretax losses were lower than last year on flat 
year-to-year sales in the quarter ended May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's revenue gain for Campeau mainly was because of a contribution of a 
full year's results from Federated and Ralphs Grocery Co., bought in May, 1988.

MCI Communications Corp., sharpening its aim at the $18-billion business 
long-distance telephone market, Wednesday unveiled a new package of services 
and discounts for small- and medium-sized businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It said this will give users who spend more than $500 a month on long-distance 
calls some of the same breaks that big telephone customers receive. 
</P>
<P>
"Smaller and mid-sized enterprises represent the largest and fastest-growing 
portion of the commercial telecommunications market," said Timothy Price, MCI 
vice president for general business. 
</P>
<P>
During peak business hours, rates for normal calls will be a flat 20 cents a 
minute. For dedicated access lines, private telephone lines set up by private 
businesses, the rate will be 15 cents a minute. 
</P>
<P>
The new prices are regardless of distance or volume for customers spending $500 
to $50,000 monthly on long-distance services. 
</P>
<P>
MCI said it will also offer a standard 20% discount on telephone calls made 
outside the 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. peak business hours.

In a move certain to set off a battle with Washington, the European Community 
wants the right under new international trade rules being negotiated to keep 
out foreign films and television shows, government sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The EC has served notice that it wants special treatment for television and 
films in any agreement on removing barriers to trade in services in the current 
four-year talks taking place under the auspices of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major concern is to protect our cultural values," said one EC negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans are concerned that they are being swamped with American 
television programs and movies. But Hollywood studios and the U.S. government 
say the move is discriminatory and arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
The EC official said the Community wants to ensure that the new pact, to be 
concluded in December, would not clash with last year's EC directive requiring 
that a majority of the programs on European television be European-made. 
</P>
<P>
As European broadcasting is deregulated, sharply expanding the number of 
channels available to viewers, U.S. programs have soared in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, local film producers in Europe have faced increasing difficulties in 
competing with high-budget Hollywood films.

A bill repealing many of the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust 
laws was approved Wednesday by the House Judiciary Committee over unanimous 
Republican opposition. 
</P>
<P>
On a 19-17 vote, the panel voted to open insurance companies to antitrust 
lawsuits for price-fixing, attempted monopolizing, allocating territories among 
rival companies or forcing consumers to buy insurance they do not want to 
qualify for coverage that they do. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the committee's 22 Democrats, Reps. Dan Glickman of Kansas, Bruce 
Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio, voted with all of the 14 
Republicans in opposing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from antitrust suits 
since 1945 under the McCarran-Feguson Act, which delegated regulation of the 
now $500-billion-a-year industry to state governments. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups and others have complained since the mid-1970s that lax 
oversight by some states has permitted the companies to use anti-competitive 
practices to deny coverage and raise rates dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"Private individuals, local governments and businesses of all sizes have found 
their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage severely restricted," said Rep. 
Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), the judiciary committee's chairman. "Congress can no 
longer ignore the widespread economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high 
premiums or policies that are unavailable at any price." 
</P>
<P>
The federal antitrust prohibitions would not apply in states with "active" 
regulatory programs.

A NEW MENU AND A BOUILLABAISSE COUP RAISE THE SANTA BARBARA EATERY ABOVE THE 
CROWD.

Early on a summer evening, Cafe Vallarta is a vision. The sun's waning rays 
light up the place, slanting through the small front dining room before 
reaching the high, four-seat tapas bar where (if you're lucky) they glisten off 
your dish of ceviche and the bottle of cold Bohemia beer standing next to it. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the weather's cloudy or the sun's already down, you'll have to 
close your eyes and concentrate on the food alone. But that's not a bad option. 
Handsome as the place is, food is what it's really about, as Santa Barbara has 
been discovering. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Justo Garcia's restaurant was just one of the crowd of Mexican 
eateries on Haley Street. Then Garcia and his newly acquired partner, Liliana 
Parr, worked out a new "classical Mexican and Yucatan cuisine" menu, quite 
different from Haley Street's usual taco/enchilada repertoire. But that wasn't 
all that happened. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Garcia created a small stir in Santa Barbara food circles. 
It seems that he showed up at the Santa Barbara Bouillabaisse Festival in the 
Santa Ynez Valley and, without a recipe, pretty much flying by the seat of his 
pants, beat out several of the area's most prominent chefs for first prize. The 
bouillabaisse publicity, together with the menu changes, lifted Cafe Vallarta 
well above the rest of Haley Street. 
</P>
<P>
The new menu includes such things as a calamari-stuffed chile relleno, which 
uses a pasilla chile in place of the more ordinary Anaheim variety. It's been 
roasted gently and then, without ever being breaded, stuffed with a rich 
mixture of calamari, red pepper and onions in a cream sauce made with jack 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Garcia's pollo almendrado, a Mexican dish for those not in a mood 
for spicy food. The chunks of chicken in their sauce of almonds, lime juice, 
tomatoes, garlic and mushrooms have character enough without chiles. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's usual side dishes, the poblano rice and black beans, are distinctive 
for the firmness of the beans and the seasoning in the rice, which turns out to 
be mostly cilantro and a touch of Anaheim chile. Accompanying everything are 
fresh corn tortillas, handmade on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
The ceviche sitting next to the beer on the tapas bar is marinating in quite a 
spicy chile sauce and, in this case, is made with octopus. As we know, ceviche 
is raw fish "cooked" in lemon or lime juice; here, the octopus has actually 
been cooked in the conventional way as well, and it's tender, rather than 
rubbery -- a dish to convert octopus-haters. 
</P>
<P>
The tapas bar snacks -- many of which can be ordered as main dishes -- are 
nearly all worth trying. Personally, I can never resist a dish that bills 
itself as "cooked in banana leaves," such as the cochinita pibil. It apparently 
loses its banana leaves by the time it gets to you, but the pork is delicious 
in its colorful Yucatecan achiote sauce. 
</P>
<P>
I found the cochinita pibil worth ordering the next time as a main dish. On the 
other hand, the Culiacan-style prawns, stuffed with herbs and cheese and 
wrapped in bacon, are best in the small tapas quantity. In the main dish size, 
I'm afraid, they're overwhelmed by the bacon. 
</P>
<P>
At least they're good in small quantities. I'd avoid altogether what our blond, 
cornrowed waiter described as an absolutely marvelous persimmon cheesecake. It 
turned out to be absolutely frozen. Garcia claims that that's the way much of 
his clientele likes it, but I'd rather buy my frozen desserts at 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you may be wondering about the famed bouillabaisse. On the menu, it's 
listed as caldo de mariscos, and it turns out to be a rich seafood stew with 
shrimp, fish, octopus, mussels and vegetables. The sauce is made with a 
fish-bone stock, with seasonings, including saffron and cilantro, spices that 
seem to be more or less a Cajun mixture . . . and lots of garlic. I wasn't at 
the bouillabaisse contest, but I wouldn't be surprised if the garlic made it 
the winner. It's powerful. 
</P>
<P>

REGGAE PERFORMER PATO BANTON IS ON A QUEST TO SAVE THE WORLD WITH HIS UPBEAT 
SONGS AND MESSAGE. 
</P>

"Tell the people I'm bringing them lots of love," said budding reggae star Pato 
Banton in a recent interview. This guy is so upbeat, he makes Mr. Rogers seem 
like a brownshirt or Jack LaLanne a pessimist. Banton will bring his happy feet 
to the Ventura Theatre Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Banton, born Patrick Murray to Jamaican immigrants, grew up in the ghettos of 
Birmingham, England. He found his escape through music, first as a toaster -- 
sort of a reggae rapper that has nothing to do with breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared on a classic English Beat album, "Special Beat Service," with his 
buddy, Ranking Roger, on the song "Pato And Roger A Go Talk." Then Banton put 
together a band and began performing with some of his other musical friends, 
Steel Pulse and UB40. He has five albums to his credit now; the new one, on 
I.R.S. is "Wize Up!" 
</P>
<P>
Banton is a man with a mission -- call it mission impossible if you will -- but 
he wants to save the world. Hey, someone's got to do it. The title tune on the 
new album is an impassioned plea for disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a human being that believes in God," Banton said. "I believe that 
music can definitely change the world -- positive music, that is. Negative 
music, we don't need -- like all this heavy metal. This is devil worship music 
and this rap music that's always putting women down -- we don't need that. We 
need peace and love. The problem with the world today is all this man-made 
stuff, this Star Wars -- everyone's saying 'I want power.' We don't need power; 
we need peace and love. Only those who cannot comprehend peace and love put it 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Banton describes his music as "conscious reggae. Most reggae begins as 
conscious reggae at its first stage but then the artists get all mixed up and 
start doing things for publicity and lose their way. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of reggae has gotten electronic -- people are trying a lot of things to 
get noticed by the media. Also, there's a lot of rudeness in reggae today, the 
lyrical content has gone astray. If you want to get sexy, it should be left in 
the bedroom. The original aim of reggae was to enlighten the youth and show 
people a better life." 
</P>
<P>
The Drug Abuse Resistance Education people would love Banton, well, up to a 
point. One of his new songs is called "All Drugs Out." On this one, Banton 
bashes cocaine, crack, LSD, heroin and also, cigarettes and alcohol. Part of 
the chorus says: "Drug pushers in every area selling dope on the street corner 
to even the young toddler -- these people should be charged with murder."

TRENDS: PEOPLE INTERESTED IN MARRIAGE PATTERNS REPORT THAT WOMEN IN 
FORTYSOMETHING WEDDINGS HAVE A NEW MOTTO: BIG IS IN, AND WHITE'S ALL RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Carol Tishler knew that there would be mixed responses even before she 
announced that, at age 44 with one divorce behind her, her second wedding would 
be bigger and glitzier than her first. 
</P>
<P>
Etiquette or no etiquette, Tishler wants her upcoming wedding to have it all -- 
the long, white gown with veil and cathedral train, the walk down the aisle, 
the tossed bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
"His parents think we're crazy to have a big wedding," said Tishler, a Los 
Angeles real estate agent who is planning to marry a 38-year-old Newbury Park 
physicist at the end of June. "People think when you're having a second 
marriage, you shouldn't be so frivolous," she said. "But I think the way you 
start out is important." 
</P>
<P>
Tishler, it seems, isn't the only middle-aged bride who thinks so. The U. S. 
Census Bureau doesn't keep statistics on such things, but people with an 
interest in marriage trends report that weddings involving both divorced and 
never-married women in their 40s have changed. 
</P>
<P>
These days, they say, fortysomething weddings are displaying a new motto: Big 
is in, and white's all right. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that if you were over 40, you got married in a quiet, little 
ceremony in a tasteful, little suit. You certainly didn't advertise it and make 
a big to-do about it," said Tracy Cabot, author of the recently published book 
"Marrying Later, Marrying Smarter." "Nowadays, though, a lot of older brides 
are having fun with their weddings. They're going all out." 
</P>
<P>
Editors at Bride's magazine in New York deemed the trend toward bigger weddings 
for older brides pronounced enough that, six issues ago, they created a new 
section called "Marrying Later, Marrying Again." The section addresses issues 
that middle-aged brides probably gave little thought to 20 or 30 years ago -- 
including what's tasteful in dress lengths, creative places to register for 
gifts and whether ex-spouses should be asked to care for children during the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them wonder what type of ceremony is appropriate," said Millie 
Martini, Bride's associate editor. "They want to know if they have to be quiet 
about it. But we think the wedding experience can be just as wonderful for an 
older bride as for a younger one." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, ministers, bridal consultants and wedding photographers also report 
that living-room ceremonies for the over-40 bride are on the decline. Even 
women making a second or third trip to the altar, bridal store owners say, are 
opting for large, formal ceremonies and shopping for long, white wedding gowns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising how many want to walk down the aisle," Emily Zajak, owner of 
the Wedding Party in Santa Barbara, said of older brides. 
</P>
<P>
Of the divorced women who come into her store, Zajak said, the majority "are 
going for the full gown and veil because they didn't do it the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case for Tishler, whose first wedding was a small civil ceremony 
when she was 17. Tishler, who is Jewish, said that, at the time, no rabbi would 
perform the ceremony because the bridegroom was not Jewish. Her future in-laws 
refused to attend because their son was marrying a Jewish woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of wearing white now as spiritual purity," said Tishler, whose 
upcoming marriage will be performed in a "conservative Jewish ceremony" in 
Thousand Oaks. "Besides," she said, "when someone gets married today, I figure 
who's a virgin anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
There is another reason why older women are bucking the unspoken tradition of 
keeping their weddings small and sedate. After years of raising children alone, 
struggling in the workplace, and finding themselves in and out of unsatisfying 
relationships, many said they began to believe that marriage wasn't in the 
cards. When they discovered that they were wrong, they decided to celebrate in 
a big way. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, I was willing to settle," said Deanna Burski, a Moorpark bank 
manager who divorced 15 years ago, at age 31 with two small children. "You get 
so depressed because you can't find that person. You wonder if you're asking 
for too much." 
</P>
<P>
In February, at the urging of her daughter, Burski placed a personal ad in a 
local newspaper. The next morning, her husband-to-be opened the paper, looking 
for a good deal on a used truck. 
</P>
<P>
They met at a restaurant a few days later and "closed the place." 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought maybe I should get married in off-white," Burski said, 
laughing. "So many people say you shouldn't be married again in white. Even my 
mother said that. But then I talked with wedding consultants and they said, 
'No, this is the '90s.' They said to do whatever I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Burski is planning to wear a long, white gown in a large, church ceremony next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Wedding-related professionals say an increasing number of middle-aged brides 
are digging into their bank accounts to ensure that things will be exactly the 
way they want them to be. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest things now is that the bride is often picking up the whole 
tab for the wedding," said Helen Cherry, a photographer in West Hollywood who 
specializes in photographing older brides. "I did one wedding that cost 
$27,000, and she paid for it all. 
</P>
<P>
"They're too old to ask their parents, and a lot of them are successful in 
their careers," Cherry said. "They can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
One 43-year-old environmental consultant in Los Angeles, who had never been 
married and asked not to be identified, said she gladly paid for her $10,000 
wedding to a physician on Valentine's Day last year. The cost included a 
pearl-studded white dress from Italy, an orchestra, opera singers, $3,000 worth 
of flowers and a sit-down dinner for 125 guests. She also paid for their 
honeymoon to Bali. 
</P>
<P>
Author Cabot, who was a first-time bride seven years ago at the age of 42, 
attended the woman's wedding and said she could relate to the extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
"You think you're old and you'll just get married in a suit, and then you 
figure what the hell," she said. "You've had this fantasy for all those years, 
and it doesn't matter what it costs. You want it the way you want it, and you 
don't mind paying to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Although many fortysomething weddings now rival the size of their 
twentysomething counterparts, one element does appear to be different. Several 
bridal consultants and ministers said older brides tend to plan their weddings 
between November and May, perhaps to avoid problems of finding available 
reception halls or florists during the busy summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot, who has a Ph.D. in philosophy and works in Sherman Oaks as a consultant 
to single women looking for husbands, has her own theory. "The last thing an 
older bride wants is to be on a honeymoon with her husband, on a beach in a 
one-piece bathing suit and get run over by a bunch of 22-year-old brides. I 
mean, would you?" 
</P>
<P>
Not unless the 22-year-olds are male -- which brings up the issue of older 
brides and younger men. These days, marriage-related professionals say, it's 
not as unusual as it once was to see women in their 40s marrying men who are 
anywhere from five to 20 years their junior. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's the creams they're using," joked the Rev. Richard Henniger, a 
minister at the Cameo Wedding Chapel in Ventura, who said he has seen a 
noticeable increase in September-May marriages. "It's sometimes a shock to 
discover this is a 40-year-old woman marrying a 22-year-old man." The women, he 
said, "often don't look that old." 
</P>
<P>
Henniger's wife, Shirley, has witnessed something else in over-40 weddings at 
the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had several pull up their gowns, get on the back of a Harley and then 
ride off into the sunset," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, I guess it's their traditional storybook wedding."

I would dread the times my father would walk through the door after work and 
tell my mother, "Margaret, I'm feeling frisky tonight." They would push aside 
the furniture in the parlor, and put on a Glenn Miller Orchestra record 
featuring saxophonist and singer Tex Beneke. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they would dance right there in front of us. They called it "cutting the 
rug." We called it nauseating. It got to be a pitched battle sometimes for 
control of the stereo: Our Led Zeppelin albums vs. Big Band buddy boy Beneke. 
One day Dad threw me a clipping from a jazz magazine and said: "Read." So we 
did. We read that Beneke, who was born in Ft. Worth, Tex., joined the Glenn 
Miller Orchestra in 1938 and quickly became one of the band's leading soloists 
with hits like "Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider." After Miller's death, Beneke led

MILLET TRIES TO BE BEST IN HER FIELD; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: THE UCLA JUNIOR, WHO WON NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE DISCUS AND SHOT PUT, 
IS SETTING OLYMPIC-SIZE GOALS FOR HERSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The pleasant demeanor of UCLA's Tracie Millet makes it difficult to believe at 
first what her coach, Art Venegas, says about her. 
</P>
<P>
Venegas, weight events coach for the Bruin men's and women's track and field 
teams, said that Millet, who recently won NCAA championships in the shot put 
and the discus, is "the meanest athlete" he has ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
To set the record straight, Millet, a junior from the state of Washington, is 
not fond of kicking small dogs or tearing the wings off flies. When Venegas 
says that she is mean, he is merely calling her a tough competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"What sets her apart is her competitiveness," said Venegas, who has been with 
the UCLA track and field team for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen so many athletes who just dazzle you in practice. They have their 
technique down, (have a good) attitude and (demonstrate) strength and training. 
They're just perfect and ready to take on the world. 
</P>
<P>
"But on the day of a competition, they just fold. They tighten the noose around 
their necks. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracie is definitely a pressure performer. When she's really mentally up, she 
is awesome. When a meet comes she is very fierce. She is very tough when a meet 
is on the line, and she dominated the NCAAs." 
</P>
<P>
Millet, who went to high school in Auburn, Wash., was awesome when she 
performed before family and friends this year at the Pacific 10 Conference 
championships in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
She set school records as she won the shot put with a throw of 53 feet, 9 3/4 
inches and the discus with a toss of 190-2. Her mark in the discus was the 
second-best ever by a Pac-10 performer. Arizona State's Carla Garrett had a 
198-5 throw in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the NCAA meet in Durham, N.C., she was not quite as awesome, but still 
dominated her competitors. In the discus, her mark of 183-9 was more than 18 
feet farther than that of her nearest competitor, Rachel Lewis of Minnesota, 
who had a final toss of 165-5. After shot putter Christy Barrett of Indiana 
State took a second-round lead with a throw of 53-2 1/2, Millet edged her for 
the championship with a mark of 53-6 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Her two national titles were firsts for a UCLA woman at an NCAA meet. Evelyn 
Ashford won national championships as a Bruin sprinter in the 100- and 
200-meter dashes in 1977, but that meet was under the auspices of the 
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. The championships were also 
firsts for Millet; she was third in the discus in her freshman and sophomore 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Millet said that setting personal records in the shot and the discus before 
family and hometown fans at the Pac-10 meet in Seattle was "by far probably one 
of my best track experiences." She said that, although she finished first in 
both events at the NCAAs, she did not approach that meet with the same fervor 
that she had in the conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that her successful but long collegiate season made it "hard to 
get motivated" for last week's USA/Mobil National Track and Field 
Championships, a qualifying meet for the Goodwill Games, which will be held in 
Seattle in July. 
</P>
<P>
She qualified for the final in both the shot and discus in the USA meet at 
Cerritos College, but she finished far back in the field in both events and 
won't be competing in the Goodwill Games. Connie Price of the Nike North Track 
Club won the discus at 191-6, and Millet, competing for the World Class Club, 
was eighth at 171-1. Price also won the shot put with a mark of 60-10 3/4 and 
Millet was ninth at 50-1 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she had an excellent season, and her two NCAA titles will not be 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some excellent (women) athletes at UCLA, (including) -- Flo Jo 
(Florence Griffith Joyner) and Jackie Joyner Kersee, but none of them won two 
individual NCAA titles," Venegas said. "That's a unique thing." 
</P>
<P>
Her setbacks at the USA meet won't deter her from a goal of making the U.S. 
national team and competing in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Venegas said that Millet was "a little overmatched" at Cerritos College but 
that she has "an excellent chance of making the Olympics, particularly in the 
discus. She probably just has to keep her head focused and maybe put on a 
couple of extra pounds (on her 6-foot, 185-pound frame). She has an outside 
chance in the shot." 
</P>
<P>
He said that she will have to increase her range in the shot to about 60 feet, 
which still would not guarantee her a spot on the national team, and that she 
should make the team in the discus if she improves from her best mark of 190-2 
to about 210 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"She is an up-and-coming discus thrower, and I know the top girls are already 
noticing her presence," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Millet said that she has been able to put on the pounds that are necessary to 
weight throwers, but that she has had some difficulty turning the additional 
pounds into muscle. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Venegas has been "on my case to gain weight and threatened to 
make me a distance runner." She said that she drinks high-protein milkshakes to 
maintain her weight and lifts weights and runs to harden her body. But she said 
it requires constant effort to maintain that regimen. 
</P>
<P>
Doing what is necessary to be a top weight thrower, including watching what she 
eats and getting enough sleep, doesn't leave much time for studies or a social 
life, she said. But she is determined to stay with it and reach the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
She said her goal is to weigh about 185 but to look like 160. She said that she 
hopes to reduce her body fat to less than the 16% it measured in the fall of 
1989, the last time she was tested. 
</P>
<P>
Venegas said that no one wants to put on fat and that throwers have to be 
"athletic and lean. The only overweight person allowed on the program is me." 
</P>
<P>
Top-flight competitors have to work hard and make sacrifices, "but they gain 
things that other persons never aspire to," he said. He said that Millet will 
be rewarded for her hard work when The Athletic Congress, the governing body of 
amateur track in the United States, sends her and other college throwers to 
compete this summer on a three-week tour of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Millet said that she might take a redshirt season at UCLA next year. She would 
use the year to work toward a goal of breaking the college records in the 
discus, shot and javelin the following season. She qualified for the NCAAs in 
the javelin, but she said that she didn't compete in the event because she 
didn't "want to risk the strain and stress on my body." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks that her chances of breaking the three college records after a 
redshirt year "are pretty good with Art's coaching and understanding. All it's 
going to take is a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm awkward, and I need a lot of coaching. But I have the potential. I've gone 
from not knowing to a better understanding of how to throw." 
</P>
<P>
Venegas might call her awkward, but he would only be kidding her. "Without a 
doubt, she's the best (woman) thrower I've had at UCLA. . . She's just 
scratching the surface of her talent." 
</P>

UCLA ROARS TO THIRD-PLACE FINISH AT NATIONAL ROWING CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's crew team finished third in last week's National Collegiate 
Rowing Championship at Cincinnati, the best finish in school history by a 
varsity eight. Wisconsin won the race in 5 minutes, 52.5 seconds, defending 
national champion Harvard was second in 5:56.84 and UCLA third in 5:56.87. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Salonites, the UCLA women's crew coach, was named Pacific 10 Conference 
coach of the year for the second consecutive year. Her varsity eight, which won 
the Pacific Coast Championship this year, finished fourth at the women's 
nationals on June 4 in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Zenon Babraj, the UCLA men's crew coach for the past four years and a 
three-time Pac-10 coach of the year after winning three consecutive Pacific 
Coast titles, said that finishing third at Cincinnati was significant. In three 
previous nationals under Babraj, the Bruins were fourth once and sixth twice. 
</P>
<P>
"We broke through the wall at nationals this year and it was a great experience 
for this team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a young team and have everyone back from this year's boat except for 
one rower (senior Stefanos Volianitis of Greece). Next year we could be one of 
the favorites to win the national title." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA women named to the All-Pac-10 team were Leilani Johnson, Kim Cromer, 
Leslie Lewis and Cathie Heacox. Bruin men on the all-conference squad were Greg 
LeSage, Brad Marquardt and Volianitis. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA gymnasts Chris Waller, Chainey Umphrey and Scott Keswick have been named 
to the U.S. national team for the second consecutive year as a result of their 
performances at the U.S. Gymnastic Federation Championships in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, who finished second in all-around competition to John Roethlisberger of 
the University of Minnesota at the federation meet, also was named to the U.S 
team for the Goodwill Games, which will be held July 2-Aug. 5 in Seattle. Yefim 
Furman, the UCLA assistant men's coach, will be an assistant at the Goodwill 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
Waller is a senior. Keswick and Umphrey, both sophomores, finished fifth and 
eighth, respectively, at Denver. The trio will compete against the Soviet Union 
Aug. 3-5 in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Keswick and Umphrey will also compete at the U.S. Olympic Sports Festival on 
July 6-15 in Minneapolis. Art Shurlock, UCLA men's coach, will be one of four 
head coaches at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica High lost her first race of the year in the 
100-meter hurdles two weeks ago at the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento, 
but she avenged that loss Saturday at the Keebler Invitational in Elmhurst, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb, a two-time state champion in the event, finished second at Golden 
West to Ayo Atterberry of New Rochelle, N.Y. The two raced again last weekend 
and Lipscomb edged Atterberry, 13.92 seconds to 14.02. She then came back to 
win the 300 hurdles in 42.47. She leads the nation in the 300 hurdles this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Keebler meet invites the nation's top high school talent to compete. 
</P>
<P>
The USC-bound Lipscomb won the 100 and 300 hurdles at the state meet June 3 
with personal best times of 13.58 and 41.69, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen baseball players have signed national letters of intent with 
Pepperdine.

championship, shared 3-A City player of the year honors with senior utility 
player Rene Lopez of Bell High on All-City teams selected by the baseball board 
of the First Interstate Bank-Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Choi, the winning pitcher in all four of the Lions' playoff games, had a 12-1-1 
record and an earned-run average of 1.31. Lopez hit .444 with six home runs, 
had 44 runs batted in and was 5-1 with a 0.80 earned-run average as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Others named to the All-City 3-A team included senior outfielder Alex Dyachenko 
of Fairfax, junior outfielder Edwardo Payan of Fairfax and Hamilton senior

PAYSINGER WILL COACH BEVERLY HILLS FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carter Paysinger, a longtime Beverly Hills High assistant football and baseball 
coach, was named Tuesday as the school's new head football coach. Paysinger 
succeeds Co-Coaches Dick Billingsley and Bill Stansbury, who have resigned to 
accept head coaching positions at Oak Park High and Paso Robles High 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best thing for the program, because there will be continuity," 
Stansbury said. "They will run the same offense and defense. Had they brought 
in somebody new, it would be extremely difficult to learn a whole new offense 
and defense in such a short time." 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury believes Paysinger has many attributes to become a successful head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very bright, personable, has excellent rapport with athletes and is a 
very knowledgeable football person," Stansbury said. 
</P>
<P>
In two respects, Paysinger's appointment is unprecedented. He becomes the first 
walk-on head football coach at Beverly Hills. He is also believed to be the 
first alumnus to become head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger was a faculty member until taking a leave of absence at the start of 
the school year to enter private business. He did remain a member of the 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a concern of mine at this time," Principal Ben Bushman said of 
Paysinger's walk-on status. "I don't consider him a walk-on because he's been a 
full-time staff member. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been one of the integral members of our staff, and when he decided to 
come back, we decided to have him. In every sport he's coached here, he's done 
an outstanding job." 
</P>
<P>
Bushman was Beverly Hills' football coach during Paysinger's playing career as 
a wide receiver and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as being very dedicated and a smart player," Bushman said. 
"He's studied the game and knows it well." 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger inherits a team that was 3-7 last season, with three of the losses 
coming by forfeit during the teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
Paysinger's brothers Vonzie and Donald, who were both football and baseball 
stars at Beverly Hills, will serve as assistant coaches.

SWIMMING: BUSY BEVERLY HILLS SOPHOMORE MEREDITH BOOKER IS AHEAD OF THE 
COMPETITION IN THE POOL AND IN THE CLASSROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
Before anyone rushes to hype Meredith Booker's chances to be America's first 
black female Olympic swimmer, it's important to keep one thing in mind. She's 
only 14. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, a sophomore at Beverly Hills High, has physical abilities and emotional 
maturity that make it easy to forget her age. 
</P>
<P>
"She swims as fast as a young adult," said John Apgar, her coach on the Team 
Santa Monica club. "And she's always been around older groups, so she has the 
maturity of someone who's older." 
</P>
<P>
Booker won the 100-yard freestyle and finished second in the 100 backstroke in 
the CIF Southern Section 3-A Division championships this year. When she was 12, 
she swam the fifth-fastest backstroke and the 18th-fastest freestyle times ever 
in that age group. Booker holds Southern California records for 12 year olds in 
the 50 freestyle and the 100 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend she will compete in the Meet of Champions at Mission Viejo, the 
first long course event of the summer. Booker wants to qualify for the Senior 
Nationals meet, which will be held July 29 to Aug. 3 in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my own goal for the summer," Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
Booker's personal ambitions are what drive her, and are also the source of the 
pressure she feels, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My coach and my parents don't put a lot of pressure on me," Booker said. "I 
want to perform and do well. That's where the pressure comes from." 
</P>
<P>
Apgar is wary of adding more pressure by placing unreal expectations on Booker. 
Nevertheless, when it comes to evaluating her abilities, he spouts praise like 
a geyser. 
</P>
<P>
"Meredith is the most talented swimmer, at the youngest age, I've ever had," 
Apgar said. "She's a person with a really bright future." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett Tester, her coach at Beverly Hills, likes Booker's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very coachable," Tester said. "Her attitude toward competition is very 
good, too. She's the type of girl you want on your team." 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches cite Booker's work ethic as the key to her success. She currently 
swims 17 hours a week, including three before-school sessions at USC that begin 
at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of time working out," Booker said. "Whatever I've accomplished I 
feel I've worked very hard for." 
</P>
<P>
In time, the hard work could result in a berth on the 1992 Olympic swim team. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd have to come very fast from this point," Apgar said. "It can be done, 
but it's not obligated or expected." 
</P>
<P>
Tester said: "She's going to have a shot. She has a good chance to make the 
trials, and anything can happen in swimming in two years." 
</P>
<P>
If she did make the Olympic swimming team, it would be a first for a black 
athlete. Booker is not concerned about making history. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think of things like that," she said. "I'd be happy if I just 
made the Olympic trials because I'd accomplish more than a lot of other people 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Tester said Booker must prove herself in one respect. 
</P>
<P>
"She still needs to have a great meet at a great time," Tester said. 
</P>
<P>
Booker had a chance to do that in April, but she finished fourth in the Western 
Junior Nationals competition in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time I made the top eight, and I was pretty happy with that," 
Booker said. "But I was a little disappointed in my performance." 
</P>
<P>
Booker and her support group of coaches and parents felt that tension had a big 
effect on her performance. She said she is aware that others are feeling stress 
before a big meet. "I looked around and I realized there were a lot of people 
who were more nervous than I was," Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
Apgar said the nervousness serves as a reminder of Booker's age. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the way she carries herself, because of the maturity, people forget 
she's 14," Apgar said. "Occasionally you can sympathize with her if she gets a 
case of nerves." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to think the 6-foot Booker is older than 14. She answers questions as 
smoothly as a veteran. Part of her maturity comes from being around older 
people all her life. She started school at 4, and at an accelerated pace, had 
finished third grade by the time she was seven. She will be only 16 when she 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said being the youngest member of the crowd has not been much of a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I got used to it," Booker said. "It seems like I'm the same age everybody else 
is. I don't think it makes any difference how old I am." 
</P>
<P>
Booker's key to success in the classroom is the same as in the pool: hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids at school think I'm really smart or something, but I just work a lot," 
said Booker, who with weighted honors courses has a 4.2 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said she does schoolwork, "every spare moment I have," even if it means 
studying Spanish during nutrition break or staying up until midnight to work on 
a report. Two of her early choices for college, Stanford and UC Berkeley, are 
strong in academics and swimming. She said she would eventually like to go to 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Booker began taking swimming lessons when she was 3, partly to ensure that she 
would be safe around water. She began swimming competitively at 7, when a coach 
asked that she join a swim team. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to our first meet, and we got hooked," said Myra Booker, Meredith's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
It also meant the end of spare time for Myra and her husband, Richard. They 
have spent the last seven years driving, cheering and worrying for Meredith, 
and more recently for their 10-year-old daughter, Sheriden. 
</P>
<P>
"Her parents are highly supportive of her swimming," Tester said. "They're not 
domineering, just very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Supportive enough to wake up at 5 a.m. to drive Booker to the morning swim 
sessions. Still, Myra insists it is Meredith's initiative that keeps everything 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"Without her being motivated and ready to go, it wouldn't be worth it," she 
said. "She wakes (me) up in the morning, and she's already dressed and eaten 
breakfast." 
</P>

Judging by the amount of time put into it, swimming has become as much of a job 
for the Bookers as it is a sport.

"It's not as much fun as it used to be," Myra Booker said. "I wouldn't call it 
a chore, because there are so many wonderful moments, but it's so much more 
serious. It's not just playing around anymore."

Danny Cameranesi of Thousand Oaks and Chip Bell of Ventura have a very busy 
week coming up. They'll be competing in the annual U.S. Open Frisbee -- excuse 
me, "Flying Disc" -- Championships beginning Monday in La Mirada. It's a 
seven-day event involving the top 250 diskers from around the world, competing 
in seven events. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, known as Scott when he's working as an insurance salesman, is the 
defending freestyle champion of the World Beach Frisbee competition. He expects 
to do well at the Open, too, but isn't quick to admit it. "In the past, I've 
said I'll win and then I end up in eighth place," he said, "so I'm not going to 
do that. If I make the top three I'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Cameranesi, on the other hand, doesn't expect to win any of the events, though 
he is entered in all seven. 
</P>
<P>
He said that four years ago he set a goal to win the overall seven-event 
championship by 1992. In 1986 he finished 60th overall, the next year he placed 
29th, and the year after that, 13th. He's hoping for a top-four finish this 
time around to remain on pace. 
</P>
<P>
Danny is not the only one in the Cameranesi clan who is adept at throwing a 
Frisbee. His brothers, Pat and Mike, are also top-notch. "When we were kids, we 
always liked to play catch," Danny said. "We'd try to hit objects with the 
Frisbee . . . whether it was the neighbor across the street, a trash can, or a 
light post." 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to attend the championships, you should probably come prepared with 
a little knowledge of the lingo. 
</P>
<P>
* Hein: "Apparently it came from the word heinous," Cameranesi said. "When you 
do a heinous crime, it's nothing to brag about. But in this case, it's like 
better than good, an extremely rad maneuver." Or, as Bell said, "Get hein or 
bail, which means get good or get out." 
</P>
<P>
* Spounch: "It's the opposite of hein," Bell said. "A guy brought it over from 
England. It sounds great with an English accent. I hope my day doesn't go 
spounch." 
</P>
<P>
* Boosh: This is a contraction of a common expletive. "It supposedly came from 
a small child slurring the word. I don't know, I wasn't there," Cameranesi 
said. "Usually, it's used on a bad judgment call. It's bad, something that 
shouldn't have happened. It's nothing to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
* Goob makes spounch hein: This is perhaps the ultimate flying disk sentence. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't translate too well. If someone says this to you, just 
nod noncommittally. 
</P>
<P>
The Clocktower Inn in Ventura will celebrate its fifth anniversary tonight with 
a party from 5 to 8 p.m., benefiting the County Museum of History and Art. 
</P>
<P>
Located on Santa Clara Street in the historic downtown section of the city, the 
Inn is on the spot formerly occupied by a 1940s firehouse. Also, the clock 
tower is the original. "They used to hang hoses in it to dry," said Sharon 
Morse, director of sales. "Now we store chairs up there." 
</P>
<P>
Ushers at the Ventura Theatre found out June 12 what it feels like to be truly 
Byrned. Through the first couple of Brazilian dance numbers by ex-Talking Head 
David Byrne, they were busy keeping antsy fans from dancing, particularly near 
the exit doors where it would represent the greatest fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Well, between songs, Byrne let it be known that he wasn't too pleased with the 
ushers' actions. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see one more usher stop someone from dancing," he said, "I'll walk off 
the stage . . . " With that the crowd excitedly rushed out onto the floor, 
while at least one usher angrily stormed through the previously unblocked exit 
door. That particular usher, by the way, when he wasn't clearing people off the 
floor, had been doing a little cha-chaing himself. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, almost forgot. Happy summer solstice. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the longest day of the year, is connected with legends going way, way, 
back. "To the dawn of time," said Jerry Fecht, professor of history, humanities 
and marketing at Moorpark College. "For our ancestors in the Northern 
Hemisphere midsummer was when the Sun God, the most powerful of the ancient 
gods, was most apparent. They celebrated with feasts and sacrifices to the Sun 
God. It was, in effect, a high holy day. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Fecht said, "It was probably a day they could kick back and have fun 
with friends, because after that the days got a lot stickier and a lot hotter." 
</P>
<P>
Also, midsummer night was the night the "ancients" believed that young males 
and females would have magical dreams and could turn into different creatures. 
Hence, Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream." LEO SMITH

COMPOSTING GREEN WASTE IS THE NEXT STEP IN HOUSEHOLD RECYCLING TO SAVE LANDFILL 
SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
You've already begun to recycle. Aluminum cans are money all of a sudden, and 
glass, plastic and paper are catching up. You like recycling. You feel 
virtuous. 
</P>
<P>
What's next, then? Answer: the other half of your curbside trash -- yard waste, 
or green waste. Back-yard composting plus citizen action to support county and 
city composting are part of the solution to the crisis surrounding the 
city-dump-is-going-to-overflow issue. 
</P>
<P>
What? Who cares? First, it's a citizen's concern and second, a homeowner's. As 
a citizen, you should know that if your city or county composts your yard and 
tree trimmings, it can obviate the need for more landfill sites and higher 
civic expenditures for refuse waste disposal. Consider: About half of what we 
throw away in California (i.e. every other full trash can) is compostable. It 
costs $65 to dump a ton of waste and $35 a ton to process it as compost. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, the Ventura Regional Sanitation District will launch a pilot 
composting project in which Fillmore and Santa Paula, as well as selected fruit 
and vegetable processors, will bring 30 tons per week of compost waste to the 
Toland Road landfill during an experimental period of nine months. This means a 
pile of grass and tree trimmings big enough to cover Government Center won't 
become garbage. According to project coordinator Mark Capron, this volume is 
small compared to what they'd like to take out of the waste stream and what 
they need in the way of product. 
</P>
<P>
"With our county mulch needs and gardeners picking up free loads, we'd be 
running out of product even if we composted all the green waste in the county." 
</P>
<P>
In this respect Ventura is really fortunate to have desert soil, which cries 
out for compost. According to the Washington, D.C.-based Solid Wastes 
Management Assn., 13 Eastern states have such a surplus of green waste that 
they've mandated that cities stop putting it in landfills. Capron's colleague 
Kelly Polk says that's not indicated here. 
</P>
<P>
To save water and build a recycling ethic, county officials are encouraging 
back-yard composters. I put my plastic bin in the front yard for the same 
reason my parents put up a new antenna when we first got a color TV. It's going 
to be the latest thing. As with any gizmo, there's the $19 version and the $149 
version. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the mix you put into it that counts. 
</P>
<P>
The county mixes ingredients on an industrial scale, turning the layers of 
grass, leaves, tree shreddings and vegetable peelings with a Rototiller. 
Back-yard composters do it with a spade or composting tool. In the past, folks 
have simply piled and turned the ingredients every few months. Modern organic 
compounds enable us to achieve the same results in weeks in a special 
container. Local housewares stores are just now getting in yard waste recycling 
kits or will order them. 
</P>
<P>
Your own composting operation probably won't consume all your yard waste. It's 
also not a destination for meat, fat scraps or doggie doo. We're talking strict 
vegetarianism here from beginning to end. The result is rich, sweet-smelling 
humus. Giving yard wastes to the refuse hauler is like throwing out expensive 
bags of fertilizer and peat moss. If you had a regular free supply, you'd be 
delighted. Well you do, if you compost. 
</P>
<P>
THE DETAILS: In Ventura County: Sale of bins, organic inoculants and 
instruction books, brand-name Ringer Yard Guard and Soilsaver composters are 
available at Target, Ojai Valley Nursery, Oak View Builders' Mart, K mart and 
Builders Emporium and by mail order from Williams-Sonoma 415-421-4242. For 
information on county programs, call 805-658-4606.

THE COUNTY'S ONLY PUBLIC ROPING ARENA IS NO PLACE FOR SHADE-TREE COWBOYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A cigarette hanging from his lips, Don Marcotte opened the chute and another 
steer roared into the arena with two horsemen in pursuit, lariats swinging. 
</P>
<P>
It's another Sunday for Marcotte at his R&amp;R Equestrian Park in Fillmore, 
the county's only public roping arena. For hours he tended the chute while 
about 50 riders from as far away as Los Angeles and Santa Barbara practiced 
roping steers. 
</P>
<P>
The R &amp; R is not an arena for the rhinestone cowboy. One small bench serves 
as the grandstand. When ropers want to compete in the two jackpots Marcotte 
offers, they can clip a $10 bill to a drawstring that goes up to the 
announcer's booth atop a little snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the arena, faded signs against the railing advertise a backhoe company, 
a car dealership and a local chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
There's no sign on California 23 pointing to the arena which Marcotte has 
leased from the city of Fillmore for 11 years. It's a dusty spot outside town, 
surrounded by acres of brush and the mountains in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, this is the place for the serious roper. Some of the horse trailers parked 
near the arena cost as much as a new BMW. Here, a roping horse runs $2,500 to 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Marcotte operates the arena on Sunday afternoons and Wednesday nights. His 
wife, Betty, runs the snack bar, and his daughter, Shelley Barta, announces and 
times the contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to rope," said Marcotte with a gruff Nebraska accent. "I still do when 
I feel like it." 
</P>
<P>
It's not for the meek. Nor is it just for the wiry, muscle-taut cowpoke 
anymore. Among the riders were a grandmother, an 11-year-old boy, half a dozen 
stuntmen, a carpenter, a retired flower grower, a film producer and a dentist 
-- all hoping to sharpen their skills for the local rodeo circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 39 when I took this up," said Della Velarde of Thousand Oaks. Now into 
her 15th year, she ropes with her husband, competing at rodeos in Ventura, 
Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here every Sunday, the Lord willing," said Velarde, whose makeup and 
hairdo were still in place after two hours in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as Encino dentist Chris Hansing, make the trek to Fillmore twice a 
week to practice and compete. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great stress release," said Hansing, wearing a spotless, starched white 
Oxford shirt. "When you're on a horse, there is just one thing you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hansing, a look-alike for actor Mark Harmon, has been roping three years. He's 
so taken with the sport he has a miniature wooden steer in his office and 
between patients he practices with a short rope. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder it takes endless practice. The ropers go after the steer in 
pairs, one on either side of the animal. The header, on the left, tries to rope 
the horns first. Then the heeler, aims for the back hooves while they are in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started, eight or nine seconds was a good time," said Wally Southard, 
whose silver belt buckle showed he won the Oldtimers Team Roping competition at 
the Ventura County Fair in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now these young kids come in at five or six seconds," said Southard, who 
retired from the Navy and lives in Somis. He isn't the oldest oldtimer at the 
arena. Elmer Fontes, a retired flower grower, is 72. 
</P>
<P>
"I never rode a horse until I was 55," said Fontes, a stocky guy in a blue 
T-shirt and cap. "I had to work for a living." 
</P>
<P>
The competition at the arena is good-natured. Depending on the number of 
riders, the jackpots can be a few hundred dollars. The top-notch riders freely 
part with advice for the less experienced. Between tries, they relax on their 
horses, smoke a cigarette, sip a beer and josh each other about technique, 
rodeos or spills. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday they were still talking about the spill Donna Huddleston of Casitas 
Springs took recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I roped the steer, got to the end of the arena and the horse went one way and 
I went the other way," said Huddleston, 36. "They took me out in an ambulance." 
At the hospital she was treated for a blood clot on her bladder. 
</P>
<P>
Sunburned and tough as nails, she works as a heavy equipment operator. She 
started roping at the age of eight, and now teams up with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
When a horse kicked her and broke her leg, it didn't stop her from competing at 
the Ventura County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband lifted me up onto the saddle and (held) my foot in the stirrup with 
a rubber band," she said. Despite the cast, she won the most points and picked 
up a another belt buckle that year. 
</P>
<P>
Getting thrown off the horse and kicked by a 400-pound steer isn't all these 
ropers have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
The weight of the steer can yank the stiff, nylon rope with tremendous force. 
Ropers have been known to lose a thumb with one, quick slice of the rope. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed some in the 11 years the Marcotte family has run the arena. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more women now, and the new people are more serious about it," said 
Barta, a secretary who ropes with her husband. "They're not shade-tree 
cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN: The R&amp;R Equestrian Park is located at 308 Chambersburg Rd, 
which is also Highway 23, about one mile south of Fillmore. Riding and Roping 
starts at noon on Sundays and at 7 p.m. on Wednesdays. Participants pay $10 per 
event. Spectators are admitted free.

SANTA BARBARA ZOO; 
</P>
<P>
A TALL STORY; 
</P>
<P>
A DEFORMITY IN A GIRAFFE'S NECK HAS BECOME A LEADING ATTRACTION AT THE SANTA 
BARBARA ZOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard the one about the giraffe with a sore throat? Try the one about 
the giraffe with a kink in her neck. 
</P>
<P>
It's no joke to the people at the Santa Barbara Zoo. They're baffled by the 
very noticeable zigzag halfway up the neck of the 4-year-old female giraffe. 
</P>
<P>
It's so striking that the gangly animal has become one of the newer attractions 
at the zoo. A sign at the giraffe enclosure even points out the bizarre 
deformity and assures observers the animal is in no pain and that zoo 
veterinarians are monitoring her. 
</P>
<P>
"Our veterinarian contacted other giraffe keepers and no one had heard of 
anything like it," said Nancy Hollenbeck, assistant director of the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
To find out conclusively what is wrong would require that the giraffe be 
anesthetized and X-rayed, she said. That poses a 30% to 50% risk of death, and 
zoo officials decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
"She walks normally, she eats normally, and she shows no sign of pain," said 
Hollenbeck. The current theory is that it's a muscle contraction that grew 
progressively worse until last summer and now seems to have stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The giraffe's crooked neck isn't the only new oddity for visitors at the zoo. A 
pair of tapirs recently arrived from Central America to take up residence at 
the zoo. The giant hog-like animals with their long flexible snouts wallow in 
muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
They're far from cute, but the male and female are starting to show an interest 
in each other, and that's good news to zoo officials. The tapirs, relatives of 
the rhinoceros, are an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
There's always something new to see at the Santa Barbara Zoo no matter how many 
times you've been there. Because it's a small, compact zoo, it's an easy place 
to take children. The entire 81-acre grounds can be covered in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Located on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, the Santa Ynez Mountains and the 
Clark Bird Refuge, it's more than a zoo. The garden-like grounds make it a 
horticultural paradise, especially with the addition of a new cactus garden. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's small, the zoo is home to more than 150 kinds of animals -- rare 
animals like the lesser panda, the black and white ruffed lemur, and the golden 
lion tamarin. 
</P>
<P>
It has the usual sampling of elephants, lions, sea lions, monkeys, snakes, and 
a large collection of birds including the rare Bali mynah and a flock of 
flamingos. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest exhibits is the nocturnal hall, a dark setting for the 
animals of the night who sleep during the day. Special lighting reverses night 
and day for the animals and makes it possible to see the night monkey and 
Geoffroy's cat as they skitter around glassed-in enclosures that look like 
their natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The spookiest exhibit in the nocturnal hall is the re-creation of an old mine 
shaft that is home to a swarm of bats that cling to the beams and flutter 
around as the sounds of the night are piped in. 
</P>
<P>
For children, there's a lot to do at the zoo. A miniature train takes riders on 
a one-mile spin around the zoo grounds. A playground comes in handy when the 
kids need a break from the animals. Or, the children can buy crackers in the 
gift shop and feed the goats in the farmyard exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN: The Santa Barbara Zoo is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and 
from June 11 through Sept. 3 (Labor Day) from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The elephant 
training demonstrations are usually at 2 p.m. and the sea lions are generally 
fed at 4 p.m. Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for senior citizens and children 2 
to 12 years, and free for those under 2 years. For more information call 
962-5339.

GIANTS' MAGIC TAKES A NIGHT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Giants kept waiting for some of that June divinity to intervene Tuesday 
night. And while it threatened to hijack the proceedings on a number of 
occasions, it couldn't quite make a clean break. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres, holding on for dear life through almost every inning past 
the first, stopped the Giants' sprint toward summer with a 4-3 win at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped the Giants' nine-game winning streak and left them with a 
wholly respectable 16-2 record in June. The Padres, consistent whipping boys of 
the Giants this month, won for just the second time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Second-place San Francisco dropped a half-game in the standings to first-place 
Cincinnati, which split a doubleheader Tuesday with the Atlanta Braves. The 
Giants are 7 1/2 games back. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego led from the first inning, but the Giants let several perfect 
comeback opportunities sift slowly through their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
They came up with the perfect comeback setup in the bottom of the seventh, when 
Will Clark and Padres reliever Craig Lefferts provided two minutes of the 
highest drama. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had spent a lot of time in the on-deck circle while Rick Parker 
twice made the last out of an inning with runners on base, came to the plate 
with the bases loaded, two outs and the Padres leading 4-2. In short, just 
about everything the Giants could have asked for to build on a nine-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs and runners on first and second, Parker coaxed a walk from Padres 
reliever Greg Harris to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
With the majority of the 31,164 at Candlestick on their feet, Clark blew the 
punch line by lofting a meek fly ball to left on a 1-2 pitch. As he rounded 
first base, he chose to vent his frustrations on home-plate umpire Ron Barnes, 
with whom he disagreed strongly on a strike call on the 1-0 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, the Giants provided another short segment of the magic that has 
become commonplace this month. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell singled to lead off the inning. After Lefferts had retired Matt 
Williams and pinch hitter Greg Litton, Robby Thompson lifted an innocent pop to 
shallow center. Padres shortstop Garry Templeton, with his back to the plate, 
had it skip off his glove and Mitchell -- running hard from the time of contact 
-- scored from first to make it 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
With Thompson on second, Jose Uribe ended the threat with a groundout to third. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, the ninth inning held its share of moments as well. Brett 
Butler singled with one out, then Clark -- looking redemption square in the 
face -- lined a single to center to put the winning run on base. Mitchell then 
lifted a popup that was gathered in by third baseman Bip Roberts to end it. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres built their lead by referring to the crib notes provided by the 
Giants the past month. They got after it early. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego reached Giants starter Francisco Oliveras for three runs in the first 
inning. Roberts walked, stole second and scored on Roberto Alomar's single. 
Alomar went to second when Brett Butler's throw to the plate handcuffed Gary 
Carter, then scored when Joe Carter singled home his 56th run of the year. 
Oliveras balked Carter to second and wild-pitched him to third before Mike 
Pagliarulo's sacrifice fly made it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
The unlikely -- and unimposing -- Giants relief squad of Ed Vosberg, Bob 
Knepper and Mark Thurmond held the Padres in check, waiting for the expected 
onslaught that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Don Robinson gave the Giants their first run in the seventh with the 
first pinch-hit homer of his career, a first-pitch blast off Bruce Hurst that 
reached the bleachers in left. It was Robinson's 12th career homer. He had been 
0 for 10 as a pinch hitter since joining the Giants in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's final run -- and, as it turned out, its most important -- came in 
the top of the sixth. Reliever Greg Harris led off with a ringing triple to the 
base of the fence in left-center and later scored on a fielder's choice by 
Roberts.

PADRES PITCHERS DON'T GET EVEN, JUST GET GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Oh, it wasn't quite the satisfaction the Padres were seeking. They wanted to 
retaliate against the San Francisco Giants for one broken arm and four bumps 
and bruises this season but claimed that they never really had the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
So they did the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres defeated the Giants for the second time in less than 24 hours, 4-3 
in 11 innings, Wednesday afternoon at Candlestick Park and then verbally 
assaulted them again from the sanctuary of the visitors' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there was no violent behavior on the field. Padre pitchers never 
threw any brush-back pitches, and even though Padre batters were hit three 
times during the series -- including twice Wednesday -- there was no 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to any action Wednesday was in the seventh inning, when Giant 
starter John Burkett hit Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar in the left hand. 
Alomar began walking toward the mound and took three steps toward Burkett 
before both benches cleared. No punches were thrown, no pushes exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
But once again, the Padres vowed, "Wait until next series.' " 
</P>
<P>
Padre center fielder Joe Carter, who was hit in the left forearm Tuesday night 
by Francisco Olivares and then again in the right hand Wednesday by Burkett, 
said: "We've got to stand up for what we believe. They say they're just 
pitching inside; well, there's just too many coincidences, and I'm getting sick 
and tired of it. I'm really ticked off right now. I can see getting hit one 
time, but not five, six times. 
</P>
<P>
"We already got one guy (Santiago) who's out a month and a half. We all know 
that pitch to Benito was going for his head. And now they're coming for more. 
Well, we're not going to just stand there and take it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to pitch inside, fine. But you don't have to come at someone's 
head. You're talking about people's careers here." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have hit five Padre batters in the past 29 innings; they've hit just 
four others in the other 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't the time," Padre first baseman Jack Clark said, "but their time 
will come." 
</P>
<P>
Would it have come Wednesday if the game had not been so close, someone asked 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, it definitely could have," he said. "No, it definitely would have." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, several Padre position players said, even though all three games were 
close, they wished their pitchers would have retaliated once and for all to end 
all of these empty threats. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wanted to do something," Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn said, "it could 
have been done Monday night." 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you want to get technical about it, the Padres did pitch inside to the 
Giants once Wednesday, when Padre starter Andy Benes threw a fastball to Matt 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," Carter said, grimacing, "you mean the pitch he struck out on." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dobson, the Padre pitching coach, defended his staff by saying that it 
would have been stupid to put any Giant hitters on base needlessly, 
particularly because the Padres never had a lead larger than one run Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So their method of vengeance was simple, Dobson said. 
</P>
<P>
Just get the damn guys out. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, the same team that was averaging nearly eight runs a game and 
batting .329 entering the three-game series, scored just eight runs in 28 
innings against the Padres, batting a measly .159. 
</P>
<P>
Their terrifying threesome of Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Williams, the 
sight of whom has left teams trembling, were reduced to pussycats. 
</P>
<P>
Clark: two for 11, zero for four with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell: one for 12, zero for five with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Williams: two for 11, zero for four with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Total damage: .147 average, one homer, one triple, seven strikeouts and hitless 
in 13 opportunities with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Padre reliever Craig Lefferts, who spent the previous 2 1/2 years with the 
Giants, was their biggest nemesis. He bailed Greg Harris out of a bases-loaded 
jam in the seventh inning Tuesday night by getting Clark to fly out to left, 
then returned Wednesday for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts came onto the scene this time in a 3-3 tie in the eighth. Clark was on 
first, Mitchell at the plate, Williams on deck. 
</P>
<P>
What problem? 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts induced Mitchell into an infield pop-up, ending the eighth, then 
managed to squirm out of the Giants' best opportunity to win in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, leadoff hitter Brett Butler attempted to reach with a bunt single 
but instead popped it up toward first base. Clark stuck out his glove to catch 
it but dropped it. The crowd of 40,071 at Candlestick loved it, just as they 
had enjoyed Clark extending his hitless string to 26 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Litton further complicated matters by hitting a single to center, sending 
Butler to third. Next up: Will Clark. The fans rose to their feet and reached 
for their car keys, prepared to see Clark win the game by just hitting the ball 
out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Clark hit a soft ground ball to shortstop Garry Templeton. Butler 
broke for home, and Templeton threw to catcher Ronn Reynolds, who easily tagged 
out Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was next up. He stood at the outside edge of the batters' box, so far 
away from home plate, Lefferts remembers thinking, that he was daring him to 
pitch inside. Lefferts threw a slider down and in and groaned as Mitchell hit a 
line shot down the left field line. 
</P>
<P>
But there was third baseman Mike Pagliarulo, sticking out his glove and 
catching the white blur to end the inning and what would be the Giants' final 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, deciding to end this nonsense, opened the 11th by hitting a ball 
into the right-field corner for his first triple in two years. Shawn Abner 
drove him in with a double that caromed off Litton's glove in right field. And 
that was all the Padres needed. Harris came on in the 11th, pitched a 
one-two-three inning, and the Padres became the first team since the Pittsburgh 
Pirates on May 26-27 to defeat the Giants in successive games. 
</P>
<P>
It was then time for the Padres to vent their emotions about the Bay Area boys. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alomar, the man who casually strolled toward the mound after being hit by 
Burkett: "Those guys are throwing at us on purpose. There's no right-hander 
that can throw to your head like that. He's not that wild. I told him I'm not 
going to put up with it. I'm not afraid of those guys. I'm still mad what they 
did to Benito." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no one more angered than Carter. He actually had to be restrained 
by Gary Carter, Will Clark and Rick Parker from going to the mound and saying 
his piece. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what I was going to do," Joe Carter said, "but I know 
this, we weren't going to put up with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Will Clark: "Joe kept saying, 'We had five guys hit. We had five guys 
hit.' 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I got a solution, plain and simple, get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. The Padres promise the best still is to come when they meet again 
Sept. 3-4 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
It might be time for Padre Manager Jack McKeon to enroll his players in those 
math and geography classes. Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar, forgetting 
there were already two outs in the sixth inning, took a throw from third 
baseman Mike Pagliarulo and then threw to first base to get bewildered Kevin 
Mitchell for the imaginary fourth out. It's at least the third time this season 
that the Padres have forgotten either the count or how many outs there were in 
an inning. It was Tuesday night that Padre outfielder Shawn Abner walked off 
second base with a two-count strike on Joe Carter. And it was May 9 in St. 
Louis when Pagliarulo walked off the field after two outs as a run scored. But 
the most comical incident of all occurred Tuesday night after Craig Lefferts 
got out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh. He immediately started running 
into the Giants' dugout until he was intercepted by Padre first baseman Jack 
Clark. Oops. Sorry, Lefty, you're a Padre now. . . . Lost in the Padres' 
victory was the performance of Andy Benes, who allowed just one hit and two 
runs (one earned) in six innings.

SOCKERS MISSING FROM FIRST TEAM OF ALL-MISL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The All-MISL Team, selected two weeks before the playoffs began and announced 
Wednesday, reflects the Sockers' 25-27 regular-season record -- none of the 
players from the league champion were selected to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
Defender Kevin Crow was named to the second team, and midfielder Branko Segota 
and defender George Fernandez were honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Socker playoff MVP Brian Quinn, who had career post-season highs for assists 
(17) and points (26), said the voting by two media members in each league city 
was fair based on the regular season. Quinn, a midfielder, missed 18 of those 
games because of a hamstring strain and then a groin strain. He was not among 
the 18 players selected. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any star performers during the regular season to warrant it," 
Quinn said. "It's nice to have the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crow: "Brian Quinn had probably the best playoff season in the history of 
the sport but missed (so many games) during the regular season," Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
Crow finished the season with 92 blocked shots and 20 points in 51 games. 
During the playoffs, he had a club-record 37 blocked shots, second best ever. 
In his five previous MISL seasons, he had been on the All-MISL first team four 
times and honorable mention once. His sixth All-MISL mention as a defender ties 
Kansas City's Kim Roentved for the league record. 
</P>
<P>
During the regular season, Segota had 27 goals and 34 assists in 44 games. He 
has earned All-MISL mention eight times in nine years, tying Steve Zungul for 
the most ever. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first all-league honor for Fernandez, after seven indoor seasons. 
Fernandez had a team- and career-high 98 blocked shots and was the MVP of the 
MISL All-Star game in San Diego. He has played in 132 consecutive 
regular-season games, 177 including playoffs. Both are club records. 
</P>
<P>
All-MISL 
</P>
<P>
First team: Tatu, F, Dallas; Jan Goossens, F, Kansas City; Preki, M, Tacoma; 
Wes McLeod, D, Dallas; Bruce Savage, D, Baltimore; Scott Manning, GK, 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Second team: Michael King, F, Cleveland; Dale Mitchell, F, Kansas City; Tim 
Wittman, M, Baltimore; Kevin Crow, D, Sockers; Mike Powers, D, Dallas; Joe 
Papaleo, GK, Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention: Dale Ervine, F, Wichita; Domenic Mobilio, F, Baltimore; 
Branko Segota, M, Sockers; Fernando Clavijo, D, St. Louis; George Fernandez, D, 
Sockers; Slobo Ilijevski, GK, St. Louis.

PITCHER ROOT DIGS IN, LEADS CHATSWORTH TO 2-0 WIN OVER WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM BENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From all appearances, Mitch Root was not going to last long. 
</P>
<P>
Root, the starter for the Chatsworth American Legion team, had allowed runners 
to advance to third in each of the first two innings Wednesday. Opposing 
pitcher Pat Treend of Woodland Hills West, on the other hand, had not given up 
a hit in the first two innings and appeared poised and dominating. 
</P>
<P>
The struggling Root clearly needed his teammates to rescue him with some 
sparkling defense. 
</P>
<P>
They did. Two double plays, diving and leaping catches in the outfield and one 
offensive spurt dug Root out of trouble. Gathering strength, he had enough good 
stuff to lead Chatsworth to a 2-0 District 20 win. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to throw my hardest, I was just moving it on spots," Root 
(2-0) said. "I got good defense from Tommy (Lee, the Chatsworth shortstop) and 
a lot of guys saved me. (Woodland Hills West) can hit the ball. I just tried to 
keep it down and get the double play." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting had the makings of a grudge match. Chatsworth (3-5) is composed 
largely of players from the Chatsworth High team that won the City Section 4-A 
Division championship. Most of the players for West watched Chatsworth 
celebrate its title at Dodger Stadium as members of the vanquished El Camino 
Real team. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, rather than two middle-of-the-pack Legion teams, Chatsworth and West 
looked more like the two top high school squads. 
</P>
<P>
Righting himself after his early unsteadiness, Root needed only 71 pitches to 
go the distance; Treend threw just 64 in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sleep sometimes after losses, but I'll sleep like a baby tonight," 
West Coach Don Hornback said. "There's nothing you can do when you lose this 
kind of a game. Both teams were outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
When Root needed early help, two double plays bailed him out in each of the 
opening two innings. In fact, the defense was strong throughout, the best 
fielding display by Chatsworth coming during the fifth inning. Treend hit a fly 
ball deep into center field, but Chatsworth's Scott Carpenter made a running 
over-the-shoulder catch. One out later, Lee dived toward second and picked off 
Chris Castillo's scorching grounder, then threw to first for the out. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit the ball hard, probably just as hard as they did," Hornback said. "We 
just hit it at people." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth got untracked offensively in only one inning. In the third, left 
fielder Robert Garbo beat third baseman Del Marine's throw for an infield 
single. After Lee popped up while attempting to bunt, Soly Maya hit a double to 
right, advancing Garbo to third. Then Scott Carpenter singled to center, 
scoring Garbo. Maya tried to score but was tagged out after Treend's relay beat 
him to the plate. Greg Poll followed Carpenter with a long drive to 
right-center. Carpenter scored and Poll pulled into third with a triple. 
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is one bad inning," Treend (0-2) said. "A couple hits here and 
that's all you need. One run, when a guy is pitching a good game that is all 
you need." 
</P>
<P>
Poll said that Treend "didn't have as much on it in that inning. He might have 
let down . . . When I faced him, he missed on the first pitch so I was ready 
for him to hit with the second one. I just turned on it."

TORRANCE HIGH'S WILLIAMSON ON 5-A FIRST TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance High third baseman Antone Williamson headed three South Bay baseball 
players named to the All-Southern Section 5-A team by the First Interstate 
Bank-Amateur Athletic Foundation board of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, a first-team choice, was one of only four repeat selections. 
</P>
<P>
The junior hit .500 (43 for 86) with eight doubles, four triples, five home 
runs and 34 runs batted in, helping Torrance to a three-way tie for the Bay 
League title. He also had two saves, including one in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Eric Gonzalez, who batted behind Williamson as the Tartars' 
cleanup hitter, was selected to the second team. Also a junior, he hit .488 (42 
for 86) with 11 doubles and 41 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills pitcher-infielder Kirt Kishita, the Bay League most valuable 
player, was named to the third team. The junior was 9-5 on the mound with two 
saves and a 3.05 earned-run average. He hit .388 with 17 RBIs. ROB FERNAS

HART PITCHER LORRAINE TO PLAY FOR WEST IN OLYMPIC FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Lorraine, a left-handed pitcher from Hart High, is among 128 players 
nationwide who have been selected to play on one of four baseball teams during 
the U. S. Olympic Festival, to be held June 30-July 11 in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, a Stanford-bound senior who was selected The Times' Valley Pitcher of 
the Year after posting a 9-0 record with six saves and an earned-run average of 
0.91, will play for the West team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great honor to be included in a group of guys like that," Lorraine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine is the only Valley-area player to be selected. 
</P>
<P>
Each team, made up of players aged 17 to 18, will play in two exhibition games 
and four medal games. The West will be coached by Mel Swerdling of Sepulveda, 
the commissioner of American Legion District 20. Swerdling coached the West to 
a gold medal in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine, 6-foot-3, 190 pounds, was selected from a group of thousands of 
nominees. High school coaches are sent player-profile forms in the spring that 
are to be returned to a Team USA selection committee. Players are required to 
submit two letters of reference from professional scouts. A player's high 
school statistics are then reviewed and evaluated before the selections are 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Players whose coaches do not return the player profiles are not eligible for 
consideration, Swerdling said.

SMITH PROPELS PANORAMA CITY TO 3-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Josh Smith hit a bases-loaded single in the eighth inning to score Fran 
Espinosa and lift Panorama City to a 3-2 victory over North Hollywood in an 
American Legion District 20 Eastern Division baseball game Wednesday at Monroe 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City's Shad Ortiz walked to lead off the eighth and was replaced by 
pinch-runner Espinosa, who advanced on Roland De La Maza's bunt. John Langley 
hit an infield single and Colyn Van Buren was intentionally walked to load the 
bases, setting up the game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
With his team trailing, 1-0, in the sixth, De La Maza drove in Sean Henson. 
Later, Van Buren was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to give Panorama City 
(9-2) a 2-1 edge. It was the sixth time this season Van Buren has been hit by a 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's Harry Marks scored in the seventh to forge a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
David Unter (4-1), who struck out 12 in a game against North Hollywood on June 
5, did not record a strikeout Wednesday. Unter, a 6-foot-5 right-hander, held 
North Hollywood (1-10) to four hits to record the complete-game victory.

KAYPRO FOUNDER WINS ROUND IN FIGHT TO CONTROL COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The balance of power at Kaypro, the strife-torn computer company, shifted in 
favor of founder and chairman Andrew Kay on Wednesday when a U.S. bankruptcy 
judge appointed Leonard Kneeland as the fifth Kaypro board director. 
</P>
<P>
The newly constituted Kaypro board immediately fired Roy Salisbury, whom Kay 
had hired as Kaypro chief executive in February but with whom Kay had become 
mired in a bitter power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting at an attorney's office after the bankruptcy court hearing, the board 
replaced Salisbury with Ben Fisher, a longtime Kay associate and former Kaypro 
employee. Fisher was nominated as interim president at Kay's urging by a 
committee of minority shareholders, who also agreed to the appointment of 
Kneeland to the Kaypro board. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Meyers deferred until July 13 a ruling on whether 
to appoint a trustee for the troubled personal computer company. Kaypro filed 
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on March 1 and has since ceased 
manufacturing and laid off all but 10 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Kneeland joined Kay, his wife Mary, Salisbury and Mark Seaver, an associate of 
Salisbury's, on the Kaypro board. Salisbury had recommended unsuccessfully that 
the judge appoint his associate, Tom Lennon, as the fifth board member. Judge 
Meyers left the appointment decision largely up to the committee representing 
minority shareholders, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement through a Kaypro spokesman Wednesday evening, Salisbury 
said he and Seaver would remain as Kaypro directors until a shareholders 
meeting can be held to approve the new board. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Kneeland and Fisher is Kaypro's best chance to "reorganize 
under a unified direction" and to end the company's internal corporate warfare, 
said John Smaha, an attorney who represents Andrew Kay. 
</P>
<P>
That warfare was characterized by Salisbury's April 2 firing of Kay, who 
founded Kaypro and who is the company's largest shareholder. Salisbury accused 
Kay of mismanagement and misuse of corporate assets. 
</P>
<P>
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Salisbury and his team 
said Kay and the company are the subjects of numerous investigations by 
regulatory and law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has requested Kaypro's accounting records for its 1988 and 1989 fiscal 
years, according to the SEC filing. Also, the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department is looking into bad checks purportedly issued by Kaypro totaling 
$365,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kaypro owes the Internal Revenue Service about $1 million in 
unpaid employee withholding taxes, Salisbury said in a recent interview.

ARCHITECTURE: SHOWCASING THE GENIUS OF WRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In modern architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright towers over all others like the 
mile-high skyscraper he once proposed. 
</P>
<P>
If the flashy, media-friendly postmodernism of the 1970s and 1980s made Wright 
recede into the gray middle ground of architectural history, "In the Realm of 
Ideas" brings him back in full living color. 
</P>
<P>
This traveling show, which comes to the San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park 
on Saturday and runs through September, includes roughly 160 pieces from 
Wright's career: drawings, models, photos, furniture, assorted decorative arts, 
plus the real crowd pleaser: a replica of one of Wright's houses. 
</P>
<P>
With related lectures, performances and films continuing through the summer, 
the exhibition promises to be San Diego's architectural event of the year. 
</P>
<P>
From Wright's Usonian house, juxtaposed with William Templeton Johnson's ornate 
museum building, through the idealized section titled "Building for Democracy," 
viewers feel the array of masterpieces accomplished in one man's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The delicate color renderings alone -- done by Wright, who died in 1959 at age 
91, and a handful of assistants -- have a pure art quality lacking in 
contemporary architectural drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of attempting a scholarly show aimed at the architectural elite, the 
show's organizers from the Scottsdale Art Center, including a number of 
Wright's proteges, went for a broader audience. The images are large and 
powerful, accompanied by sparse poetic snatches from Wright's own voluminous 
writings. 
</P>
<P>
Four ideas central to Wright's philosophies of organic architecture serve to 
organize the material: "The Destruction of the Box," "The Nature of the Site," 
"Materials and Methods" and "Building for Democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Like most geniuses, Wright was a dreamer whose ideas didn't always translate 
into reality; only about half the buildings included in the show were ever 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the show's images and texts are mounted on flat and curving modular 
wall panels in Wright's signature terra cotta color, with a reddish Wright 
pattern running along their bases. 
</P>
<P>
The "Destruction of the Box" section begins the show. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1890s, buildings were generally boxy and full of small rooms that 
received little or no natural light. Houses of the Victorian era are typical: 
long on exterior color and decoration, short on practical amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's departure from these conventions is succinctly traced, from the Larkin 
building (1904) and Unity Temple (1906) in Chicago, through several houses, the 
Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Johnson Building (1936) in Racine, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
The number of revolutionary ideas Wright used to move beyond boxy designs is 
astounding: open floor plans that sometimes rely on curves instead of 
conventional rectilinear plans; skylights, floor-to-ceiling glass and 
clerestory windows to maximize links between indoors and out; completely new 
feats of engineering, such as the minimalist, mushroom-like columns within the 
Johnson building and wide-open spaces made possible by new steel construction 
methods, and conventional materials such as brick used in unconventional ways. 
</P>
<P>
"The good building makes the landscape more beautiful than it was before that 
building was built," Wright wrote, a philosophy that is supported by the "Site" 
section of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Fallingwater," probably the most famous American house of the 20th Century, 
sits grandly over its Pennsylvania stream, seeming almost to have grown from 
the earth, anchored at its center by tall walls of stone. The all-wood Pew 
house is entirely different, with its weathered wood exterior blending into a 
Wisconsin forest. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate, unbuilt Doheny Ranch Resort should serve as a model for today's 
developers and planners, subtly designed to merge with its hilly setting. 
</P>
<P>
The "Materials" section shows off glass, wood, concrete block, Wright's own 
Usonian block, concrete and steel. Buildings include several houses and the 
Johnson Wax complex, where Wright insisted on skylights and clerestories made 
of Pyrex tubes bonded together. They were stunning, and at times refracted 
incoming light marvelously, but in sunny weather the glare was annoying, and 
they leaked like crazy during rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
This willingness to try strange, beautiful ideas even though they sometimes 
failed helped make Wright a true innovator. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy" closes the show with a variety of built and unbuilt Wright 
projects, proving just how broad was his contribution to architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Here are Broadacre City (1935-1936, unbuilt), a community maximizing the 
freedom of the individual through large home sites and few high-rises; the 
Florida Southern College Campus (1930s, partially built); and the Arizona State 
Capitol (1957), one of Wright's most spectacular unbuilt works. Its hexagonal 
forms were to have been rendered in copper and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The 1800-square-foot Usonian Automatic House replica ("Usonian" was Wright's 
euphemism for the United States) has been updated with appliances and fixtures 
from Whirlpool and Kohler, sponsors of the exhibition. The house is not at all 
spectacular; the floor plan doesn't include the open kitchen/living room of 
other Usonian houses. But the idea of low-cost, modular concrete-block 
construction, available to any American of moderate means, was the 
breakthrough. What star architect of today has proposed such a creative 
solution to housing the masses? 
</P>
<P>
The show suffers from a lack of specific information on projects. The 
catalogue, prepared under the direction of the Scottsdale contingent, doesn't 
include such necessary details as dates, although it does feature five 
excellent essays by Wright scholars. 
</P>
<P>
For Saturday's opening, Eric Lloyd Wright, the master's grandson and also an 
architect, will speak at 4 p.m. in the museum's Copley Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
For $3, visitors can walk through the exhibit while listening to a headphone 
presentation that includes commentary from Wright himself and several Wright 
experts. Guided docent tours are available several times a day. 
</P>
<P>
A schedule of events for the summer can be obtained from the museum. Museum 
hours are 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
and 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Thursday.

SILHOUETTING: THE KINDEST CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: AN OLD FORM OF DRAWING, IT MAY EXTEND TO BACK TO THE FIRST SHADOW 
TRACINGS. YET ONLY A FEW CAN MAKE THEIR LIVING AT CLIPPING THE FACIAL OUTLINE.

<P>
In about 30 seconds, Harry Bryce, the main silhouette artist at Disneyland for 
the past 21 years, can snip the likeness of any man, woman or child out of 
black paper. 
</P>
<P>
The paper portraits of more than 1 million people have been captured by Bryce 
throughout his silhouetting career, and in his Main Street studio at 
Disneyland, the famous profiles of Red Skelton, Goldie Hawn and Cher all have 
been trimmed to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But for Bryce, the unknown or obscure face is the one that often leaves the 
most indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
"A widow came in asking if I could do a silhouette of her husband," Bryce 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Sure, where's the photograph?' And she said, 'I don't have one, but 
maybe I can describe him to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bryce went to work with paper and scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I made the silhouette as large as I could. I gave him a full head of 
hair and made his lips and nose a little larger than I thought they should be. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I showed it to her and she said, 'Now could you trim this and trim that,' 
and I kept working it down and working it down, until she said, 'You know, 
that's pretty doggone close.' " 
</P>
<P>
But another time, rendering the silhouette of a young man sitting directly in 
front of him didn't prove any less trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd call him a dwarf or a midget, but the guy had had some kind of 
accident or some natural impairment on his upper lip; it was literally missing. 
He had nothing but teeth and gums up to the nose area." 
</P>
<P>
Bryce cut out exactly what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off the chair and he shook my hand and said, 'I really thank you. I'm 
so sick and tired of people trying to give me something I don't have. This is 
the first time anybody's ever done me exactly as I look -- and I know what I 
look like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Silhouetting, an old art, has remained popular with the public for several 
reasons. For Jim Griffin of Duarte, Bryce's $3 sitting fee fits handsomely into 
his family budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to Olan Mills (portrait studio) for a fraction of the cost," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the $3 buys two silhouettes. By folding the 5-by-8-inch paper in 
half, Bryce produces a duplicate silhouette facing the opposite direction. An 
oval frame is an additional $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Barton of Sacramento, whose 8-year-old daughter, Kelli, recently sat for 
Bryce, said she values the silhouette for what she's not getting. "You look at 
it, and you fill in what you can't see. That's the beauty of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bryce: "Silhouette cutting is to photography what radio is to TV; 
frankly, some things are better left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland may be the only place in the Southland to have your silhouette cut, 
said Bryce, who estimates that about 25 silhouettists nationwide try to make a 
living at it. But Bonnie Elliott, who began as an apprentice silhouette artist 
at Old Towne Mall in Torrance 17 years ago and now works part time as a 
silhouette cutter at Disneyland, thinks the number may be closer to 250. Both 
artists know of no other operating silhouette studio in the greater Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
That Disneyland has one of the few surviving silhouette studios attests to the 
vision of founder Walt Disney, who frequently referred to "shadow drawing" as 
the origin of all art forms, said Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
"He imagined -- and it's only a guess -- that prehistoric (people) probably 
drew their first pictures by tracing their shadows on the wall," said Bryce. 
That is basically "what we're doing now, except we don't use the shadow, we 
just use the (facial) outline." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Hickman, in her book "Silhouettes" (Walker and Co.), cites examples of 
black profiles on Etruscan pottery and Egyptian murals as evidence that humans 
have made shadow portraits since the dawn of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The word silhouette to describe a shadow portrait, she writes, is comparatively 
modern, coined in the 19th Century from the name of Etienne de Silhouette 
(1709-67), a frugal French controller-general whose favorite pastime was the 
cutting of profiles from black paper. De Silhouette did not invent the art, 
Hickman writes, but his name was applied to it derisively by those who 
considered profiles in miniature a cheap imitation of art. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of the public, however, silhouettes were inexpensive mementos to be 
exchanged as freely as snapshots are today. 
</P>
<P>
Giving further impetus to shadow portraits was the publication between 1775 and 
1778 of Johann Casper Lavater's "Essay on Physiognomy Calculated to Extend the 
Knowledge and Love of Mankind." In the 34-pound leather-bound tome, Lavater 
argued that plain black profiles were the most penetrating guide to character 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Although weighty reading, the book was illustrated with several silhouettes 
and, consequently, people rushed to have their profiles drawn in hope of 
deciphering their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hickman, Lavater -- with the assistance of the German poet Goethe, 
himself an amateur profilist -- invented a special silhouette chair designed to 
keep the subject's head rigid. 
</P>
<P>
But not all silhouettes were rapid impressions cut from paper. Just as often, 
silhouettes were painted on ovals of chalk-like plaster, on the reverse sides 
of convex glass and on cards. Portrait silhouettes also decorated fine china 
and expensive jewelry, including rings, brooches, bracelets, lockets, tie-pins, 
card cases and snuff boxes. 
</P>
<P>
In America, traveling profilists usually painted on cards or cut with scissors, 
because transporting breakable plaster and glass by horse was too risky, 
Hickman writes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these limitations, one of the first visiting silhouette artists to 
America, English Maj. John Andre (1751-81), cut profiles of Benjamin Franklin 
and George Washington. (Andre later became embroiled in the treacheries of 
Benedict Arnold and was executed after his capture by American forces.) 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of photography in the 1850s, the demand for silhouettes 
declined. Similarly, the introduction of gas and electricity contributed to the 
disappearance of silhouette making as a hobby because, Hickman notes, "modern 
overhead lighting banished the deep shadows which amateur profilists had found 
so invitingly thrown on walls by lamp and candlelight." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bryce, Elliott and other practitioners of the art of silhouette rely on 
both the artistic and entertainment values of their craft to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a nickel for every time people used the word 'amazing' to describe 
what I do, I'd be a wealthy person," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce has cut as many as 503 impressions in a single day; Elliott once did 472. 
As artists on commission, they receive a percentage of each one. When his work 
schedule at Disneyland permits, Bryce cuts silhouettes at birthdays, bar 
mitzvahs, weddings, graduations and proms, charging $85 an hour with a two-hour 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce said he also would like to teach a class on silhouetting at a community 
college because "the art of silhouette cutting is dying out and there's 
virtually no one around to teach it." 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors to their Disneyland studio are surprised to learn that Bryce and 
Elliott use only paper and scissors and not special effects to produce 
silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to see a big light projecting a shadow on a wall or screen," said 
Lisa Casco, a 21-year-old college student from Phoenix, Ariz., who recently 
visited Disneyland. "I thought they would trace my outline and fill it in with 
chalk or charcoal -- you know, the way we did it in elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Elliott, who is an art school graduate, Bryce is self-taught and 
maintains he can teach the art of silhouette cutting to anyone in eight to 10 
weeks. In fact, Bryce, who trained the two silhouettists now employed at the 
Disneyland in Tokyo, said he prefers teaching students who can't draw. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find someone who draws, they want to put perspective and give it a 
three-dimensional quality," Bryce said. "They want to add tones and lights and 
darks, but you need none of that in silhouette." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who has cut silhouettes in as little as 17 seconds, compares 
silhouette cutting to riding a bicycle: "You have to develop a certain speed 
and balance; otherwise, you fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott cuts quickly from the bottom up, moving from the base of the neck, to 
the middle of the chin, to underneath the nose, to the eyelashes and finally to 
the top of the head. While bulbous noses, sagging chins and protruding 
foreheads all make the final cut, wrinkles, scars and gray hair vanish with the 
flick of the scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the trick is to keep it all in proportion," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the speed in cutting is to prevent the artist from 
"noodling" -- the temptation to trim or cut more than what the artist sees. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way we're like haircutters," Elliott added. "Once you cut it off, you 
can't put it back." 
</P>
<P>
While Bryce and Elliott may succeed in getting subjects into the studio, 
getting them to take a seat is an art form all in itself. For example, there 
are profile-conscious adults who refuse to be positioned with their "bad side" 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to explain that a silhouette is just one line around the outside of 
their face, identical for either side, but some people refuse to believe it," 
Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Some silhouette subjects feel compelled to brush their hair or apply a fresh 
coat of makeup before posing. "Of course, it doesn't make any difference how 
much rouge or lipstick they put on," Bryce said, "but you can't tell 'em that." 
</P>
<P>
When a man and woman appear in the same silhouette, the man's head usually goes 
in front. "This way I can give more detail to the back of a woman's head, which 
is more interesting than a man's," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Also placed in front in a double silhouette is Mickey Mouse, Bryce's most 
requested Disney character. "He wouldn't fit anywhere else," said Bryce, who 
also can cut Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and the rest of the Disney cast 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizable film stars, who rarely take a back seat to anyone, present a 
challenge to the silhouette artist. "Celebrities are very hard to do because 
you know their other expressions," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryce's wife is another subject who avoids easy depiction: "I know her every 
perfection or imperfection -- however you want to take it -- so I'm never 
completely satisfied. I'll rework it, then overwork it and start over again. 
It's just very frustrating. It's much easier to do a complete stranger." 
</P>
<P>
And about himself: Was he able to capture his own likeness? 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it," he said.

Question: I have what to me is a fairly simple question, but I've never seen it 
answered anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
If a person has a high cholesterol level, and his doctor says that he should 
get it down, why not put him on a diet with absolutely no fat in it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: When I prescribe a diet for a patient who has an elevated serum 
cholesterol level, I have a twofold purpose. The first is to reduce the total 
cholesterol and fat levels. The second is to make certain that the patient 
continues to have a nutritionally adequate diet. Both goals can generally be 
achieved even if the diet includes some fat.

ENCOUNTER IN A STRANGE COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
LATINOS: SPANISH-SPEAKING SENIOR CITIZENS GATHER ONCE A WEEK TO TALK ABOUT THE 
PAST AND HELP EACH OTHER ACCLIMATE TO AMERICAN CULTURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
They came from countries far away, some fled for their lives. Now, they meet 
because they feel lost in a strange land -- the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 Spanish-speaking senior citizens meet every Friday morning at the East 
Valley Multipurpose Center in North Hollywood to talk about their lives -- good 
and bad, past and present. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, we talk of the past, we love the past," said Daisy Lugo, who 
left Costa Rica in 1946 to study English and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
One woman worries how her grandchildren talk back to her without respect. A man 
laments again about how he left everything behind when he escaped from his 
war-torn homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We come here to share our happy and unhappy moments," said club President Raul 
Alacon through an interpreter. He has lived in the Valley for the 18 years 
since he fled Chile. He had an accident falling off his horse, lost the 
equestrian school he owned and suffered two crippling strokes, but he keeps his 
spirits up with friends at Encuentro Latino (which translates as "Latin 
Encounter"). 
</P>
<P>
The meetings are dressy. Men wear suits and ties. Women are treated with the 
respect typical of the Latino tradition in their generation. An impeccably 
dressed husband-and-wife team of physicians who fled Cuba 28 years ago come to 
the meetings to advise friends about medical care and to reminisce. 
</P>
<P>
"Fidel Castro must go out," said Dr. Miguel Fuentes-Aguilera, sitting erect in 
his chair and looking at his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Then maybe, we go back," Dr. Margot Fuentes-Aguilera said while she sadly 
showed friends the gold $5 Cuban coin she made into a necklace. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group range from illegal alien farmers to former government 
officials who have left Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Peru and the Philippines. 
About half of them have become American citizens. Many of them would someday 
like to go home again, or at least feel at home here. 
</P>
<P>
"I left my Colombia, my family and I cry so much, so much depression," said 
Georgina Martinez, 78, who moved here 15 years ago. "It was so beautiful, but 
now everyone takes care because somebody will kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez now worries about relatives in Colombia. She also worries that her 
grandsons may run into trouble with gangs in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The group tries to avoid politics, but inevitably their cultures clash and 
national pride causes lively debates. 
</P>
<P>
"The president from Chile picks on my small country," said Bilar Young, 62, a 
Cuban refugee whose son fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion. "Sometimes we have 
little wars here, but there are more Cubans in this group than anyone. Anyway, 
we are Americans first now." Emilia Casanovas chokes up when she remembers the 
rich, lush mountains of Bolivia, saying, "I would like to go back to see my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Learning English is the biggest problem for the group, but a language class 
formed by Encuentro Latino members eventually petered out for lack of interest. 
Most, like Filomena Medina, 73, taught themselves English. 
</P>
<P>
"I write down every word I don't know and learn it," said Medina, who came from 
Puerto Rico decades ago when her daughter was only 6. Now, she won't go to the 
meetings unless her daughter, Miriam Stern, comes with her. 
</P>
<P>
"The elderly take time to make acquaintances, but this is good because they go 
on field trips together and talk about their different cultures," said Stern, 
who helps out at the meetings. "The group is very traditional, very formal. 
That is how most of them have been brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Encuentro Latino was started 10 years ago by Theresa Chavez, a social worker 
with Jewish Family Services, who saw a need for Spanish-speaking people to help 
each other acclimate to American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"They are intimidated by the strong and assertive ways of Americans, and they 
are angry when they are lumped together and all called Mexicans," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fourth of July is our biggest celebration because this is the ground we 
are now on," said club secretary Elvira Rosas, an Argentine native who moved 
here 22 years ago. "For me, it is like therapy to come here." 
</P>
<P>
Members exchange information about government programs, nutrition and the 
latest news of their country. They trade shopping coupons, buy Lotto tickets 
together and share financial, medical and educational advice. Often, they are 
nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, they played the Mexican national anthem to commemorate a 
holiday and a few natives held their clenched fists across their chests. Tears 
streamed down the face of Elena Velasquez, who left Mexico 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss my country," she said.

ROHRABACHER SEEKS TIGHTER NEA CONTROLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring victory in his fight to rein in the National Endowment for the Arts, 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said on Wednesday that he will offer an 
amendment to a bill to renew the arts agency that would clamp tight controls 
over the kinds of art that can legally get federal support. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's entry into what has become nearly a competition among senators 
and congressmen to draft language restricting the content of NEA-supported art 
came as behind-the-scenes negotiations continued in both the House and Senate 
to decide what kind of restrictive standards will govern the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The situation appeared to underscore a reality broadly perceived in Congress 
and among arts supporters that the 14-month controversy has reached a point 
where any bill to renew the NEA will include some form of restrictive language 
governing art content. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate's over and we won," said Rohrabacher defiantly. "The entire 
direction (in which the fight is going) is in the direction of at least having 
standards" for the specific kinds of art the NEA can fund. 
</P>
<P>
But, in declaring victory, Rohrabacher also conceded in an interview Wednesday 
morning that his chief goal when he began an attack on the NEA last year -- 
outright abolition of the agency -- is unattainable and that the arts agency 
will survive, though its freedom to operate may be significantly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said, however, that if a parliamentary maneuver thwarts the 
addition of restrictions, he will turn his attention to a fight over the arts 
agency's appropriation -- a separate bill expected to come up for action late 
next month -- with the objective of eliminating all money for the NEA and 
effectively killing it. 
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that the effort to eliminate all appropriations would be 
largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt we're going to get this thing zeroed out," he said. "My count (of 
prospective votes on issue) seems to be that we will probably continue to have 
an NEA. The bottom line is the government is going to be involved in financing 
of the arts." Rohrabacher's district straddles portions of Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a House committee sent a restriction-free NEA bill to the full 
House for debate next month, but no observers believe that the so-called 
"clean" bill -- proposed by President Bush -- will survive without major 
amendments. A Senate committee is to take up the bill next week. Floor votes in 
both chambers are expected in late July, but the NEA's fate will probably not 
be finally known until September when a conference committee takes up the two 
different versions. 
</P>
<P>
In proposing his own content-control language, Rohrabacher entered an already 
crowded field in which at least two other initiatives are under way in the 
House and Senate to fashion restrictions on NEA funding. But Rohrabacher's 
version, which is being circulated in draft form in the House, goes 
significantly further than any other proposal that has surfaced so far. The 
proposed Rohrabacher amendment to the pending NEA reauthorization bill would: 
</P>
<P>
* Ban support for any artwork that is not only obscene, but shows -- or even 
describes -- "in a patently offensive way," any organs or activities related to 
sex or human excretory functions. 
</P>
<P>
* Declare that no NEA money could go to arts projects whose effect would be one 
of "denigrating the beliefs, tenets or objects of a particular religion" or 
denigration "on the basis of race, sex, handicap or national origin." 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit money being awarded to an arts project that addresses, in any way, 
the mutilation, burning or trampling of the American flag, or even a work in 
which a flag is placed on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
* Require that no NEA grant could include any depiction of "matter that 
includes any part of an actual human embryo or fetus." 
</P>
<P>
* Decree that all federally funded art would have to conform to a controversial 
1988 federal child pornography statute that was declared unconstitutional by a 
U.S. District Court judge here last year and is awaiting a hearing before the 
U.S. Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
(The law, the constitutionality of which was challenged in a class action 
lawsuit filed by the American Library Assn., requires photographers, artists, 
book publishers and other media organizations to maintain records establishing 
that they verified the ages of every model who appeared in their work nude 
retroactively to Feb. 6, 1978. The appeals court has received briefs from the 
class action plaintiffs and the Justice Department in the case. Oral arguments 
are scheduled for September.) 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Jacob Neusner, a member of the the National Council on the Arts who 
has been a consistent critic of decisions to fund controversial projects, 
contended to an audience at a conservative think tank that NEA Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer should strongly consider resigning. Speaking to a noontime seminar 
Wednesday at the Heritage Foundation, Neusner asserted that Frohnmayer's 
stewardship since he took over last October has amounted to "stonewalling" that 
has "turned a disaster into a total catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer and Neusner have been estranged since early May, when Neusner 
publicly criticized a series of grant-making decisions at the NEA after the 
national council voted to defer action on 18 performance fellowship grants 
because some council members objected to work produced by five of the potential 
fellows. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, Neusner has developed a campaign of criticism directed at 
Frohnmayer's handling of a variety of difficult situations at the NEA. 
Frohnmayer, who declined to be interviewed, has kept a deliberately low profile 
in recent weeks -- apparently at the encouragement of the White House. He has 
canceled most public appearances and granted no interviews.

THE PASSION AND THE INTELLECT

<P>
Meet the new boss, not quite the same as the old boss. 
</P>
<P>
The rock pinata is stuffed nowadays with bands struggling to evoke the Beatles 
or trying to be the new Stones, but hardly anyone seems interested in being the 
new Who, with all the passion, bravado, bluster and sheer intellect that would 
entail. 
</P>
<P>
Filling those estimable shoes quite nicely -- and without really trying -- is 
Midnight Oil, the world-class rock 'n' roll band from Australia that headlined 
the first of two nights Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre with a 
near-faultless show exceeded in its tugging sense of commitment only by its 
viscerally overwhelming, finely detailed musical drive. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the answer to who's next. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to be among friends," announced singer Peter Garrett -- not your 
average giant, bald, left-wing Christian environmentalist, hard-rock former 
political candidate -- between edgy encore renditions of John Lennon's "Instant 
Karma" and Nick Lowe's "Peace, Love and Understanding." 
</P>
<P>
He explained, in the same earnest tones used to pitch the whale-saving and 
anti-apartheid tables in the lobby, "We have a common understanding . . . 
mistrust of Milli Vanilli." 
</P>
<P>
He then bent over the pit area, inviting fans to wipe his shaved pate: 
"Life-size sweat on stage! See, you can touch this, it's real!" 
</P>
<P>
Memorex poster boys Milli Vanilli may make an easy target. So might Exxon, in 
front of whose New York headquarters the protest-oriented Midnight Oil recently 
performed a free concert. But there's nothing overly easy about the lyric depth 
with which Midnight Oil has plumbed its themes of justice, repatriation and 
conservation, to the extent of making many of its anthem-like choruses so 
provincial in reference that they couldn't possibly mean as much to Americans 
as Australians. 
</P>
<P>
Among the quite rousing songs played Tuesday: "Stars of Warburton," 
"Warakurna," "Kosciusko." Among the themes addressed: aboriginal rights and 
outback strip mining. Clearly, this is not a band obsessed with Stateside 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
The relentless punch with which Oil put across its songs in the late '70s and 
early '80s -- when the band was playing the Hollywood Palladium and 
slam-dancing audiences were the norm -- made the Clash the closest point of 
reference. These days, though, they relent now and again, and few of the songs 
from the group's two latest albums -- which accounted for 14 of the 17 original 
selections Tuesday -- mandate a slam response. 
</P>
<P>
The Who comparison is much more apt now, and not just because Garrett did a 
fleeting windmill motion while miming during a guitar solo. The pace is more 
moderate on most of their newer songs, and nuances of melody and timekeeping 
have become far more important. The three-piece horn section used on a few 
choice numbers -- borrowed from the opening act, fellow Aussies Hunters &amp; 
Collectors -- recalled the heights of the Who's "Quadrophenia" era. 
</P>
<P>
Power chords appeared at the proper moments, but Martin Rotsey and Jim Moginie 
-- the most unassuming, out-of-the-way guitar heroes you're ever likely to find 
-- forced untold varieties of sounds from their instruments, subtle sounds you 
probably wouldn't register unless you were listening for them. Drummer Rob 
Hirst (the group's most active songwriter) has an absolute Keith Moon ferocity 
to his playing, though there was enough literally offbeat ethnic influence to 
his pounding fills that it's more like Moon after a long anthropological 
excursion. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, of course, is no Roger Daltrey: He calmly and wittily plugs 
environmental causes during the breaks (not to mention some SDI- and 
Bush-bashing), then erupts in a fury of rigid motion during the songs, like a 
cross between Joe Cocker and Robocop. 
</P>
<P>
He's both smoothly articulate and unpredictably galvanized; his band is precise 
and musically refined but positively rips. It's rock in an advanced 
evolutionary state that indeed made the Milli Vanillis of the world seem like 
crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
Midnight Oil also plays tonight at San Diego's Open Air Theatre and Friday at 
Irvine Meadows.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: HARRY JAMES SOUND COMES BACK TO LIFE AT 
DEL MAR FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trumpeter Harry James died in 1983, but his band lives on, providing a dream 
job for trumpeter Art Depew. 
</P>
<P>
Depew, who played with James for five years during the 1950s, returned 2 1/2 
years ago to lead the Harry James Orchestra, a 17-piece swing ensemble which 
hits the Del Mar Fair's Grandstand Stage this afternoon at 2. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, James was occasionally criticized for playing music he knew 
would succeed commercially, at the expense of innovation. But Depew has 
respected his idol's work since the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"I first heard him with Benny Goodman, when I was 12 or 13," Depew recalled, 
"but I saw him live for the first time at the Hollywood Palladium in 1943. He 
had a great deal of technique, an awful lot of power and strength, nice tone 
and vibrato. He was very creative and very advanced. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry was a commercial trumpet player, but he played great jazz too -- his 
solo on 'Sing, Sing, Sing' with Benny Goodman became the song's definitive 
melody. His jazz was so lucid and clear. His solos went from jazz solos to 
becoming the melodies audiences expected to hear." 
</P>
<P>
As leader, Depew now plays these solos, and he sings an occasional number. The 
material consists mostly of such James' band standards as "Sleepy Lagoon," "The 
Mole," "I've Heard That Song Before," "Cherry," "Two O'Clock Jump," "Blues for 
Sale," "Don't Be That Way" and "You Made Me Love You," James' "most successful 
ballad," according to Depew. 
</P>
<P>
Depew, who considers swing-era big band music "a lot more stimulating than 
Bruce Springsteen," said the style is catching on all over again back East, 
where people in their 20s and 30s are packing dance halls. 
</P>
<P>
Depew, 65, has worked with band leaders including Tommy Dorsey, Bob Crosby, Tex 
Beneke and Charlie Barnet, but considers his career to be one long training 
session for his ultimate job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely in love with what I'm doing. I have to maintain my abilities, 
so I practice three or four hours a day to play those solos the way I've 
trained my entire life to play them." 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that many of James' original recordings bear some 
relationship to recordings by the Count Basie Orchestra; James often borrowed 
Basie band members for his sessions. 
</P>
<P>
For comparison's sake, you can hear the newest version of Basie's group, under 
the direction of saxophonist Frank Foster, tonight at 7:30 and 9:30 at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Basie died in 1984, but his band continues to earn rave notices for the quality 
of the ensemble work and soloists. Compared with the intricate musical themes 
played by other big bands, the characteristic Basie sound emphasizes bluesy 
swing and rhythmic subtlety as much as harmonic complexity. 
</P>
<P>
If you missed Marimba Mike's multimedia performance downtown at Ruse 
Performance Gallery earlier this year, you've got another chance. Mike, a.k.a. 
Bryan Jackson, will repeat the exotic original piece "People of the Lake," an 
"ethnomusicological journey through time and space," this Friday night at 8 at 
Words &amp; Music bookstore in Hillcrest. He also plans to include compositions 
by Chick Corea, Charles Mingus and others. 
</P>
<P>
A master of many percussion instruments, Mike also plays a variety of unusual 
African wind instruments and whistles. On "People of the Lake," he uses tape 
and electronics to enhance the sound, while images of primitive art and foreign 
landscapes are projected. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $7.50; reservations are recommended (298-4011).

STARK MAKES MOST OF SECOND CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FORMER LOS ALTOS HIGH STANDOUT BATTLES BACK WITH THE CLASS AA 
BIRMINGHAM BARONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since he was a young boy, Matt Stark has dreamed of becoming a major 
league baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
But after signing with the Toronto Blue Jays after his senior season at Los 
Altos High, Stark never envisioned how difficult the dream would be to realize. 
</P>
<P>
Especially since he was selected as the ninth player in the first round of the 
1983 draft. 
</P>
<P>
In the seven years that have followed, the 25-year-old catcher and designated 
hitter has played for six teams. He has been under contract to three major 
league teams and has also struggled with serious injuries to his ankle and 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
But Stark finally appears to be nearing his goal. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Birmingham (Ala.) Barons, the Class AA affiliate of the 
Chicago White Sox, Stark is fourth in the Southern League in home runs with 10 
and second in runs batted in with 62 after the first half of the season. He is 
hitting .297 and has struck out only 25 times in 222 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 6-foot-4, 250-pound Stark was named Southern League player of 
the week when he hit .455 with a home run, three doubles and 12 RBIs in seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my ups and downs in my career," Stark said. "I've met a lot of peaks 
and valleys here and there and now it's time for me to aim upward." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Berry, a former player for the White Sox who is manager of the Barons, said 
Stark already has the ability to play in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen from Matt, he can be in the big leagues right now as a 
designated hitter," Berry said. "But whether anybody brings him up is another 
story. From my standpoint, if I want a guy who can keep the ball in play, drive 
in runs and not strike out a lot, he's my man." 
</P>
<P>
For Stark, the most imposing barrier on the road to the major leagues has been 
staying healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's Odyssey in pro baseball started with Toronto's rookie team in Medicine 
Hat, Alberta, in the summer of 1983. The next season he was with the Blue Jays' 
Class A squad in Florence, S.C. That was where his injury problems first 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
"Halfway through the season I fractured my ankle so I missed a half of a year 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from the injury, Stark made good progress the next two 
seasons. He started the 1985 season in Florence but was promoted to Toronto's 
Class AA team in Knoxville, Tenn., toward the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The following year he had his best season in the minors -- at least before this 
year. Playing for Knoxville, Stark batted .295 with 17 homers and 70 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Stark had realized his dream when he made Toronto's 24-man roster 
as a catcher in the spring of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably my best year," he said. "(The Blue Jays) gave me a full 
opportunity to make the team in spring training and I did." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, about a month into the season, disaster struck for Stark. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the big team and then a month into the season I developed tendinitis 
(in the right shoulder) and sat out the 1987," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Stark was placed on the team's 21-day disabled list. When the injury 
was slow to heal, he was sent down to Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after that that Toronto's team doctor, James Andrews, determined 
that Stark had suffered a torn rotator cuff. Andrews operated to repair three 
dime-width tears in the rotator cuff in July of 1987 and Stark spent about 
eight months in rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Stark said he was not at full strength upon his return in 1988, when he batted 
.266 with 11 homers and 54 RBIs at Knoxville. He was limited to playing 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be his final season in the Toronto organization. After the 
season, during the baseball winter meetings in December of 1988, he was 
purchased by the Atlanta Braves for $50,000 and placed on the team's 40-man 
protected roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta purchased me with the hope of being in the major leagues (the next 
season) but I never really got the chance," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was probably purchased by the Braves because former Toronto manager 
Bobby Cox had become Atlanta's general manager. "He knew I could swing the bat 
but he was taking a gamble with my arm," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
In spring training in 1989, Stark practiced at the team's major league camp in 
West Palm Beach, Fla., but rarely played in games and was unceremoniously 
released March 27. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of an unusual spring for me," Stark said. "They bought me but I 
didn't have a chance to play in many games. I only caught in a couple of B 
games and I kind of got the feeling that (Atlanta manager) Russ Nixon didn't 
care for me and the only reason I was there was because of Bobby Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"You figure that when a team purchases you for a big chunk of change they're 
going to give you a chance to play, but they never did." 
</P>
<P>
It also disturbed Stark that the Braves simply released him instead of offering 
him back to the Blue Jays. But with his arm still hurting and his wife, Sharon, 
expecting their first child, Stark decided it was best to sit out the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a year away from pro baseball, Stark wound up signing with the 
White Sox organization before this season. Although he received other offers, 
he said he chose the White Sox because Larry Himes -- Chicago's general manager 
-- seemed to be most interested. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining Chicago's Birmingham farm team, Stark has been an immediate hit 
at the plate. He plays mostly as a designated hitter and has been catching only 
once a week. Kurt Brown, a former No. 1 draft pick from Glendora High, and Matt 
Meruloo share most of the catching duties. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just trying to bring me along slowly," Stark said. "They've taken an 
overly precautious approach. Hopefully I'll catch a little more in the second 
half of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Berry: "He's been coming on but he's still at the point where he throws 
one day and then sits out. When he gets to the point that he can go out more 
than one day, we'll put him in the lineup. We're just going one day at a time 
with Matt." 
</P>
<P>
While his arm is still not at full strength, Stark said he has seen enough 
improvement to make him optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely better than it was before," he said. "The White Sox have done 
some different things with me like using a medicine ball and a tubing 
(exercise) and I think that's helped." 
</P>
<P>
He credits the improvement to a rigorous conditioning program that the White 
Sox have instituted under conditioning coaches Steve Rogers and Vern Gambetta. 
</P>
<P>
"It's excellent," Stark said. "They have two guys, one in the majors (Rogers) 
and one in the minors (Gambetta). They have aspects they work with for every 
sort of problem. That's really done a lot of good for me." 
</P>
<P>
Stark is hoping that the conditioning program will eventually enable him to 
play as a catcher in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go as a DH but my worth is more as a catcher," he said. "If I can go 
behind the dish and catch I can be more valuable because I'm just a better 
hitter than some (catchers) in the majors. In my whole career, I've never been 
a .250 hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Stark first demonstrated his affinity for hitting when he played at Los Altos. 
As a senior with the Conquerors, he batted .527 with four home runs and 15 RBIs 
and made the All-CIF Southern Section team. 
</P>
<P>
He was also an outstanding tight end in football, catching 82 passes for 1,064 
yards and six touchdowns as a senior to help lead Los Altos to a CIF 
championship. Stark was good enough to sign a national letter of intent to play 
football at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very special," said Dwayne DeSpain, Stark's former football coach at 
Los Altos. "I really felt he was an All-American, blue-chip kind of guy. If he 
made the right kind of progress at SC, I think he could have made it to the 
pros. It's just something you never know about. It's something that you can 
always talk about." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Stark said he was looking forward to attending USC and playing 
football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"But I had to make a decision that every first- or second-rounder has to make," 
he said. "I wanted to play both but that was just impossible. I could've played 
football and been pretty good but I have no regrets about it." 
</P>
<P>
Stark said he also received a strong financial incentive to bypass a college 
football career. He signed for $130,000 plus $7,500 in incentive bonuses. He is 
making $30,000 with the Barons this season. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he doesn't wonder about college life from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
"You always wonder what college life would've been like but I don't regret it," 
Stark said. "With any luck, maybe I'd have three or four years in the big 
leagues right now. But at least I'm getting another opportunity now and I'm 
trying to make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
With veteran catcher Carlton Fisk of the White Sox approaching the end of his 
career, Stark is hoping that he will receive an opportunity to play for 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't set a time limit but I'm capable of going up tonight if Ron Kittle 
(White Sox designated hitter) gets hurt," he said. "Hopefully, in September 
when the rosters go up (to 40 players), I can get called up." 
</P>
<P>
He admits that he is not as patient with his baseball career as he was when he 
first started playing in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"They always say you've got to give it time, but I'm at the point in my career 
where I have to see what I can do now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With his impressive first half of the season at Birmingham, Stark is more than 
living up to the promise that once made him a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
He is hoping the end result will be another chance to play in the major 
leagues.

DEAR FOOD EDITOR: 
</P>
<P>
The food section contained an interesting article on Philippine food by Minnie 
Bernardino ("Philippine Potpourri," June 7), which, unfortunately, perpetuates 
a common culinary error. 
</P>
<P>
I refer to the recipe for Cassava Bibingka, which calls for "1 1/2 pounds of 
cassava or yucca," among other things. Cassava and yucca are two entirely 
different plants, and if you try the recipe with yucca you will surely have 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
CLAY A. SINGER, Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's Note: Our error was in the spelling. Yucca is a familiar California 
desert plant; yuca -- with one c -- is a Central American name for cassava. We 
apologize to anyone who tried to cook yucca.

<P>
At least 10,000 people died today in a devastating earthquake that jolted 
northern Iran, demolishing scores of villages and towns and burying thousands 
of people in the rubble of their homes, an official announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Iranian Cabinet, released after an emergency evening 
session, said the "sad, painful and horrible tragedy has so far claimed 10,000 
lives and left thousands of others wounded." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency, placed all 
government organizations "on full alert" and ordered an air bridge set up 
between Tehran and the stricken areas to evacuate survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Landslides obstructed the mission of rescuers on the ground and bad weather 
hindered airlift operations by helicopters, IRNA said. 
</P>
<P>
It said that many people are still buried in the debris and that several 
hundred Revolutionary Guards were flown from Tehran after nightfall to join 
rescue teams. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization said from Geneva that the Tehran 
government has requested international assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The White House sent a message of condolences to the Iranian leadership, and 
expressed willingness to offer "appropriate humanitarian assistance should it 
be requested." 
</P>
<P>
The Geophysics Center at Tehran University said the quake had a magnitude of 
7.3, and the U.S. Geological Survey measured it at 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran center recorded 12 aftershocks after the early morning quake, IRNA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The quake struck at 12:30 a.m., when most people were either sleeping or 
watching World Cup soccer on television. IRNA quoted the Geophysics Center as 
saying it was centered 125 miles northwest of Tehran, near the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The quake also rattled the bordering Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, slightly 
damaging some old buildings in its capital of Baku but causing no casualties, 
Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor killed at least 1,600 people and injured 3,600 in Iran's Zanjan 
province, and killed 300 and injured more than 1,000 in Gilan province, IRNA 
said in early dispatches monitored in Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
It said the dead included at least 1,000 people killed in Ab-Dar, a large 
village in Zanjan province. At least 88 were killed in Qazvin just 80 miles 
northwest of Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported "massive destruction." It said that homes crumbled and that 
landslides loosed by the shock were blocking main roads, hampering rescue 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers struggled to pull victims from wrecked structures. 
</P>
<P>
The mountainous, largely agricultural provinces have a combined population of 
2.7 million, and the news agency said several villages near the 
100,000-resident provincial capital of Zanjan were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran residents said the quake shattered windows and sent people fleeing into 
the streets. They reported no casualties or serious damage in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a rocking motion," said a longtime resident of Tehran.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT BASED ON POLITICAL PATRONAGE IS BANNED 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court dealt a devastating blow to political patronage today, ruling 
that government employers generally may not base hiring, transfer and promotion 
decisions on someone's party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the justices said refusing to hire, transfer or promote people 
for politically partisan reasons in most cases violates their constitutionally 
protected freedoms of speech and association. 
</P>
<P>
The court said partisanship may play a role in such employment decisions only 
when political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for carrying out a 
job, such as a high-level policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless these patronage practices are narrowly tailored to further vital 
government interests, we must conclude that they impermissibly encroach on 
First Amendment freedoms," Justice William J. Brennan wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
The decision reinstates a lawsuit by three Illinois residents against Gov. 
James Thompson and Republican leaders in the state. Its sweeping prohibitions 
apply as well to federal and local government employers. 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark 1976 ruling and a 1980 sequel, the high court significantly 
weakened the political patronage system, sometimes called the "spoils system." 
</P>
<P>
The rulings prohibited government employers from firing anyone -- even some 
policy-making and confidential government workers -- solely because of their 
political party unless party loyalty is a requirement for effective 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
But those decisions dealt only with firings. 
</P>
<P>
Before today, the court never had said partisanship can play no role in hiring, 
transfers and promotions as well. 
</P>
<P>
The court also struck down patronage powers of government employers in laying 
off and rehiring public employees. 
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court had upheld the Illinois patronage policy in hiring, 
transfers and promotions but banned such considerations in layoffs and 
rehirings. It said layoffs are too similar to firings. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan said employee loyalty to government policies can be ensured without 
widespread patronage. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun 
and John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. 
Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented. 
</P>
<P>
In the Illinois patronage case, two men and a woman who said their job status 
suffered because they did not vote in Republican primaries or give money to the 
party sued the governor, the state GOP and the heads of several state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to supervisory 
positions in the state Rehabilitative Services Department because she did not 
support Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Taylor, an equipment operator, said he was denied an Illinois 
Transportation Department transfer to another county because party officials 
opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
James Moore said the state Corrections Department has refused to hire him since 
1978 because he could not get the backing of key GOP leaders.

2 GIRLS WHO DISAPPEARED WITH NEIGHBOR FOUND ALIVE IN DESERT

<P>
Two little girls from a tiny Mojave Desert town who disappeared with a neighbor 
a week ago were found alive today at a remote desert rest stop, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An abandoned truck belonging to the neighbor, 36-year-old Alan Erickson, was 
found, but he was still being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Putnam, 6, of Pioneertown was in the pit area of a mine when she was 
found by a passer-by about 8:30 a.m. The Rheox Inc. mines are near a rest stop 
on Interstate 40 near Newberry Springs. Temperatures in the area have been well 
above 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's bare feet were badly injured by walking in the scorched, rocky 
desert area, a San Bernardino County sheriff's report said. 
</P>
<P>
She told the passer-by that her 3-year-old half-sister, Kristina Johnson, had 
fallen into a hole and she was unable to awaken her. Kristina was found a short 
time later by searchers. There was no immediate confirmation that she had 
suffered a fall. 
</P>
<P>
Both girls were dressed only in their underpants. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson took the two girls Friday on what was supposed to be a short trip to 
buy a motorcycle part.

The brother of executed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was jailed for 15 
years today on mass murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, 66, a former general and head of the secret police 
training school, is the first Ceausescu relative to be convicted in connection 
with attempts to crush last December's anti-Communist uprising in which more 
than 1,000 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted by the Bucharest military court of inciting genocide and of 
"attempted aggravated murder" during the revolt that began in the capital six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The executed Nicolae Ceausescu's son Nicu is also being tried for genocide, and 
his daughter Zoia is in jail awaiting trial for corruption and abuse of 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
The dictator's sister Maria Agache also went on trial today charged with 
defrauding the state. Several other Ceausescu clan members face similar 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, who was convicted after almost three months of court 
proceedings, has the right to appeal the sentence within 10 days.

A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a Santa Ana pedestrian, dragging him for 
five blocks before fleeing the scene, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Damien Juan O'Campo, 23, died from massive head and internal injuries Wednesday 
night after he was struck while crossing a street with a friend, Santa Ana 
Police Sgt. Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Campo's friend, Clemente Rosales, who was also hit, suffered facial cuts and 
was listed in guarded condition at the UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The two friends were crossing Sullivan Street at Borchard Avenue shortly before 
10 p.m. Wednesday when they were struck by a car traveling north on Sullivan, 
Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosales was knocked away from the speeding vehicle while O'Campo tumbled in 
front and was caught underneath, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
Faust said the hit-and-run car is a large four-door, either dark or light blue, 
but police have no further description of the vehicle or its driver. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who saw the incident or has information about it is asked to call 
Officer Gary Stover at (714) 834-4211.

AGRA DIAMOND, WORLD'S SEVENTH LARGEST, SOLD FOR $7 MILLION

A Hong Kong jewelry company paid a record $7 million for the Agra Diamond, a 
pink stone that once adorned the turban of a Mongol emperor, Christie's said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the auction house said the sale of various jewels Wednesday 
netted a record $20.7 million, with the Agra Diamond being the most prominent 
item. 
</P>
<P>
The 32.24-carat stone is the seventh-largest pink diamond in the world, and was 
once owned by Babur, the central Asian warlord who conquered northern India in 
1526 and founded the Mongol empire. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was purchased for $7 million by Ciba Corp., a leading Hong Kong 
jewelry firm. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the sum was the highest ever paid for a pink diamond. It 
had been owned by a private English collector. 
</P>
<P>
Babur received the diamond in exchange for sparing the lives of the family of 
the maharajah of Gwalior, and named it after the site of his capital, where one 
of his successors, Shah Jehan, later built the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor also bagged the Kohinoor diamond, which now sits in the Tower of 
London as a part of the crown jewels. But the pink stone was his favorite and 
was worn on the front of his turban.

Judi Buenoano, known as "the black widow" for killing the men closest to her, 
was granted a 24-hour reprieve today a few hours before she was to have been 
executed in the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Orlando issued the 24-hour stay shortly after 8 a.m. 
Buenoano had been scheduled to die at 12:01 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Buenoano's lawyers had claimed a malfunctioning electric chair could subject 
her to cruel and unusual punishment. The Florida Supreme Court rejected the 
claim . 
</P>
<P>
If executed, Buenoano would be the second woman executed in the United States 
since the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976. She also 
would be the first woman executed in Florida.

NIXONS MARK 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

<P>
Richard M. Nixon and the "vivacious young woman with titian hair" he met at a 
theater audition in Whittier celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary today 
surrounded by their children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon and his wife, Pat, allowed a photographer and a reporter a rare glimpse 
into their home life in a woodsy setting an hour's drive from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixons' two grandsons and two granddaughters cavorted while an Associated 
Press photographer took the grandparents' anniversary picture. A few minutes 
later two of the children were in bathing suits and splashing in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixons seldom go out in public, and they allowed this visit only on ground 
rules that their remarks not be published. 
</P>
<P>
They usually celebrate special occasions with only their immediate family, 
which includes Edward and Tricia Cox and David and Julie Eisenhower. The 
Eisenhowers have three children; the Coxes one. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nixon, who has stayed out of public view since the former President left 
the White House in disgrace in 1974, wore a pink and white Adele Simpson suit 
for the anniversary portrait. Her daughters said the suit was a favorite from 
the White House years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a major stroke in 1976 and another stroke in 1983, Mrs. Nixon looked 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The former President and his wife live in a home surrounded by tall trees that 
obscure the house from the road. The four-acre grounds include a swimming pool 
and tennis court. But they will move soon to a townhouse in Park Ridge, about a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixons met in 1938 at the casting tryouts for "The Dark Tower," a play by 
George S. Kaufman and Alexander Wollcott. 
</P>
<P>
"For me it was a case of love at first sight," Nixon wrote in his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a friend to introduce us and then offered them both a ride home. On the 
way I asked Pat if she would like a date with me. She said, 'I'm very busy.' I 
said, 'You shouldn't say that because someday I'm going to marry you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I knew everyone in Whittier, but that night a beautiful and 
vivacious young woman with titian hair appeared whom I had never seen before," 
Nixon describes their meeting. "I found I could not take my eyes away from 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, then a young partner in the law firm of Wingert, Bewley and Nixon, 
married Pat Ryan on June 21, 1940, at the Mission Inn in Riverside. At the time 
she met Nixon, the future First Lady was teaching business courses at Whittier 
High School for $190 a month.

Federal anti-drug chief William J. Bennett said today if a reluctant Peruvian 
President-elect Alberto Fujimori refuses to sign a new drug-fighting accord, it 
could cost his nation future U.S. economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
"One is a condition of the other," Bennett said. "If we don't see serious 
efforts against the drug traffickers, then we aren't going to be inclined to 
offer economic assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett added, however, that he is hopeful Fujimori will ultimately approve the 
accord under which the United States would provide Peru with $39.9 million in 
military aid in fiscal 1991, all in equipment and training, to help Peruvian 
forces combat cocaine growers, processors and smugglers.

<P>
The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was in satisfactory 
condition at a Santa Fe hospital today after being injured in a horse-riding 
accident at his ranch near the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman's Washington office said that he underwent surgery late 
Wednesday to repair a separated pelvis and that his doctors reported the 
surgery was successful. 
</P>
<P>
A nursing supervisor at St. Vincent Hospital would not release any information 
other than Seidman's condition. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to New Mexico to speak to the New Mexico Bankers Assn. and to 
participate in an FDIC management conference in Santa Fe. His office said he 
was making an overnight visit to his ranch before returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman has said he plans to retire June 30 from his twin jobs as head of the 
FDIC and chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created by Congress 
to rescue the savings and loan industry.

The Senate Finance Committee today completed action on a bill limiting imports 
of apparel and footwear but made no recommendation on whether it should be 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is supported by a majority of members of the House and Senate, but 
there is some question whether the margins are large enough to override a 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration opposes the bill, and President Bush's advisers say 
they will recommend a veto if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
President Ronald Reagan vetoed similar legislation in 1985 and 1988, and both 
vetoes were sustained by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chief sponsor of the bill, said it is 
necessary "to prevent the outright extinction of the U.S. textile, apparel and 
non-rubber footwear industry." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) said, "I cannot think of a single justifiable 
smidgen of comment to say about this bill." He said it would violate 
international trade agreements and send the wrong signal at a time when the 
United States is pleading for free trade.

The Supreme Court today generally barred states and energy consumers from 
bringing federal antitrust suits against energy producers accused of conspiring 
to fix prices. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-4 ruling, the justices said only direct purchasers of energy -- in this 
case utility companies -- may file such suits. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled against Kansas and Missouri officials who accused a natural gas 
pipeline and five natural gas producers of illegal price fixing. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys general of 32 states had urged the high court to permit such 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, rejected arguments that 
states or residential customers should be permitted to sue because utilities 
lack incentive to go to court since they can pass on any overcharges to their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Utilities . . . have an established record of diligent antitrust enforcement," 
Kennedy said. "History makes us quite hesitant to take from the utilities the 
responsibility for enforcing the antitrust laws."

Technicians at the Seabrook nuclear power plant were working today to determine 
the reason for the $6.5-billion facility's first automatic shutdown, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook was operating at 30% power, producing about 210 megawatts of power, 
when its turbine automatically shut down at 4:38 p.m. Wednesday. Plant 
spokesman Rob Williams said that when the turbine disconnected itself from the 
New England power grid, the reactor also shut down automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that automatic shutdowns are a normal part of a nuclear plant's 
operations but that operators did not know what caused it. When the cause is 
determined, operators will review operations before restarting it, he said.

ARTIST PLEADS INNOCENT TO MASS FORGERY

<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Gene Tetro, described by prosecutors as one of the nation's most 
prolific art forgers, pleaded innocent today to copying the works of artists 
such as Chagall, Miro and Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
Tetro, 40, indicted on 44 counts of felony forgery, entered his plea before 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner, who assigned a public defender to represent 
him and set a pretrial hearing for July 19. 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing in March, Mark Henry Sawicki, a former associate of 
Tetro, testified that he did $75,000 to $100,000 worth of business a year with 
Tetro between 1984 and 1989. Sawicki said he sold hundreds of works attributed 
to such artists as Joan Miro, Salvador Dali, Norman Rockwell and Hiro Yamagata. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki, who was charged with selling forged art last year, agreed to be wired 
with a tape recorder and, according to authorities, recorded a conversation in 
which Tetro is heard to say he "did a Chagall" and had other fake Chagalls "in 
the works." 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki said Tetro would practice the signatures of the artists he was copying. 
</P>
<P>
"He would practice on note pads, scratch paper, sometimes even on the backs of 
damaged artworks," Sawicki said at the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki, former owner of a Sherman Oaks gallery called Visual Environments, and 
Tetro are among several art dealers local and federal authorities have 
implicated in a multimillion-dollar art fraud investigation.

"I'm trying to do movies that make people angry. I must be doing something

Iran on Tuesday formally protested to Turkey over the movie, which portrays the

turban.

Two Iranian newspapers urged their government Wednesday to take diplomatic 
action against Turkey for the continued screening of the film in Ankara and

The love story that captured the romantic imagination of a nation neared its 
climax today when Prince Aya, 24-year-old younger son of Emperor Akihito, 
returned to Japan to take the hand of his commoner fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to my new life, but distance has made it difficult for me 
to really feel the excitement," the tall prince with the droopy mustache said 
just before completing his zoology studies at Britain's Oxford University. 
</P>
<P>
Aya, second-in-line to the imperial throne behind unmarried elder brother 
Naruhito, 30, surprised the public last fall by announcing his engagement to 
23-year-old Kiko Kawashima. They will marry June 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Kiko-san," as the popular press affectionately calls her, is the daughter of 
an economics professor and was Aya's fellow student at Gakushuin University in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Aya is only the second male member of Japan's centuries-old imperial family to 
seek and win the hand of a commoner. Kawashima will be made a princess after 
they marry. 
</P>
<P>
Aya follows in the footsteps of his father, Akihito, who, as crown prince in 
1959, broke imperial precedent and married Michiko, the daughter of a wealthy 
flour miller.

Long jumper Larry Myricks, serving a three-month suspension for drug use during 
the 1990 Mobil Indoor Track and Field Championships, has tested positive for a 
banned substance at two other meets, The Athletics Congress said today. 
</P>
<P>
TAC said that it had been notified by the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, the world governing body for the sport, that Myricks tested 
positive for the stimulant phenylpropanolomine at a meet in Hamilton, Ontario, 
on Jan. 12 and at a meet in Seville, Spain, on Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Phenylpropanolomine is found in cold relief products and is available without a 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
The levels found in Myricks' samples were 14.18 micrograms per milliliter at 
Hamilton and 51.1 at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
IAAF rules call for a three-month suspension for a first-time ephedrine offense 
and a two-year ban for a second offense. A third offense could result in a 
lifetime suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, 34, is a four-time Olympian who won a bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul 
Games.

Hale Irwin picked up where he left off at the U.S. Open and scored a hole in 
one en route to a 5-under-par 66 in today's first round of the Buick Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there's a very positive carry-over from last week," said Irwin, who 
trailed early leader Kirk Triplett by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Irwin became the oldest man to win the U.S. Open when he 
defeated Mike Donald on Monday in the first sudden-death hole after an 18-hole 
playoff left them still tied. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin's ace came at the 112-yard sixth hole at the Westchester Country Club. He 
started his round from the 10th tee and was 2 under par when he hit a pitching 
wedge a few feet behind the pin on his 15th hole of the round. 
</P>
<P>
The ball spun back into the cup and Irwin -- just as he did after a dramatic 
birdie on the 72nd hole of the Open -- went to the gallery ropes to slap 
high-fives with spectators. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Big Apple. You've got to play to the gallery," said Irwin, who 
capped his round with an 8-foot birdie on the final hole.

Former tennis superstar Bjorn Borg's elegant seaside home will be seized and 
sold to the highest bidder if he doesn't pay more than $1 million within a 
month, court officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Bailiffs visited Borg's home in a Stockholm suburb Wednesday to assess its 
value. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not let in because nobody was home," said Bjorn Edgren, a senior 
court official. 
</P>
<P>
Borg reportedly was in Italy to watch World Cup soccer action with his wife, 
Loredana. 
</P>
<P>
He was given an extension until July 20 to pay the debt. "Then we can use a 
locksmith," Edgren said. The house would then be sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.1-million debt owed by Borg's former business partner, Lars Skarke, was 
personally guaranteed by the retired tennis star. Skarke was managing director 
of Borg's clothing company, which collapsed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, said the debt payment was being arranged from 
Italy but had been delayed. He said Borg plans legal action against Skarke 
aimed at getting the money back.

CRACKDOWN ON FOULS FAILS TO ELIMINATE ROUGH PLAY

After two World Cup referees were criticized for being too lenient while 
players were kicked black and blue, yellow and red cards have been brandished 
with increasing frequency in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 30 World Cup games, seven players were sent off, only one fewer 
than in the whole 52-game tournament in 1986. Yellow cards stood at 91, closing 
in quickly on the total of 135 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Play might not look more brutal than it was in Mexico four years ago as 
referees have clamped down on fouls, trying to let the game flow and attackers 
flourish. FIFA issued new orders for referees to toughen up at the start of the 
World Cup and warned teams that hefty fines would be slapped on offenders. 
</P>
<P>
But what was supposed to be a deterrent seemingly has had little effect. 
</P>
<P>
Vicious fouls with spikes swiping at exposed ankles continue to mar the game. 
Even if obvious fouls to avoid a goal get a red card, it didn't stop Cameroon's 
players in their 1-0 upset of Argentina in the World Cup's opening game. Two 
Cameroonians were ejected in a match marred by vicious tackling. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA Secretary General Joseph Blatter said last weekend that there should have 
been even more yellow and red cards flashed during the opening two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusually frank remark about referees, Blatter said Italian Luigi Agnolin 
and Soviet Alexei Spirin were not fit to referee at the World Cup any more 
after failing to curb "violent interference." 
</P>
<P>
Syrian Jamal Sharif heeded the warning. 
</P>
<P>
The little-known referee showed no less than nine yellow cards and one red in 
Tuesday's game between Austria and the United States. The game was marked by 
dangerous, high-flying tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one cards were issued in the four matches Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he would not discuss individual referees, West German Coach Franz 
Beckenbauer had his own strong words for the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"All referees should act in the same way," Beckenbauer said. "Instead there 
have been stiff and indulgent decisions so far. I would suggest that FIFA 
convenes a meeting of referees and advises them to make the same, consistent 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said Blatter would not comment on the issue until 
FIFA's referee committee meets June 27.

JC Roda of the Netherlands' first division has offered U.S. midfielder Tab 
Ramos a three-year contract. The U.S. Soccer Federation is asking for a 
$750,000 transfer fee, a figure the club has balked at.

Ramos would prefer a two-year or one-year deal, but nothing can happen until

MICHEL STARS AS SPAIN BEATS BELGIUM

<P>
Michel scored his fourth World Cup goal and set up another as Spain beat 
Belgium today, 2-1, to finish at the top of Group E. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian playmaker Enzo Scifo missed a penalty shot in the 60th minute that 
would have evened the score and denied Spain first place. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had already qualified for the second round after their earlier 
matches, but the victory gave Spain a measure of revenge for its loss to 
Belgium in a penalty shoot-out in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Michel, hat-trick hero of Spain's 3-1 victory over South Korea, became the 
tournament's top scorer when he scored from the penalty spot in the 27th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Vervoort got Belgium even three minutes later, but defender Alberto 
Gorriz made it 2-1 for Spain in the 39th minute, and that proved enough to seal 
a Spanish victory. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, which will meet Yugoslavia in the second round Tuesday in Verona, 
finished at the top of the group with five points and Belgium second with four. 
</P>
<P>
Scifo, who had been having an excellent game, ruined his day when he thumped 
the penalty shot against the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
Michel made no such mistake with his penalty shot, which set Spain on the road 
to success. 
</P>
<P>
Michel drove his right-footed shot out of reach of goalkeeper Michel 
Preud'homme, who guessed correctly and dived to the right but failed to get his 
hand on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Belgium evened the score after Scifo, mainspring of the 
Belgian attack, was fouled in front of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
Scifo ran over the ball at the free-kick and Vervoort crashed in a left-footed 
shot that took a deflection off the defensive wall, leaving Spanish goalkeeper 
Andoni Zubizarreta stranded. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later, Spain went back in front for good. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent Spanish pattern involving striker Julio Salinas, Michel and 
Francisco Villaroya was brought to an end near the corner-flag by a crunching 
tackle on Michel by defender Pascal Plovie, who had come on as a substitute for 
Marc Emmers just after the Belgian goal. 
</P>
<P>
Michel lofted a free kick and Gorriz, up in the area on the right, met it with 
a firm header which flew into the far corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium, a 2-0 winner over South Korea in their opening game, featured four 
changes from the side which defeated Uruguay, 3-1, Sunday -- with goal-scorer 
Vervoort among the quartet drafted into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian Coach Guy Thys was content with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied," he said. "We were in command in the second half with five 
new players. I don't think we have to be afraid of anybody. We came close to an 
equalizer several times."

ITALIANS SNAP UP CUP CARDS

<P>
Several American players got a kick out of the card-collecting craze in Italy, 
where youngsters rapidly bought out supplies of World Cup cards. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular cards, naturally, have been those of Italian national team 
players. But cards of former World Cup stars Bobby Charlton of England and 
Socrates of Brazil quickly became collector's items. 
</P>
<P>
Only 5,000 of those cards were produced by MasterCard, for whom Charlton and 
Socrates are working at the World Cup. Fans have offered up to $20 per card and 
many have approached both players for autographed cards, which would increase 
their value significantly.

Move over, Miss Manners, the fashionable are taking shopping-bag etiquette into 
their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
As they see it the only response to "Paper or plastic?" at the supermarket is 
"Neither," followed by a dramatic act: they whip out their own bag. This trick 
plays equally well at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Gunter for Industrial Wear offers plain, sophisticated grocery-shaped 
bags in red, black, royal or forest green. Gunter says each nylon bag holes the 
contents of two ordinary grocery bags. Priced $12.50 for one (plus postage), or 
three for $30, they are available from Industrial Wear, P.O. Box 1349, Studio 
City, Calif. 91614. The company donates a percentage of the profits to 
environmental and pro-peace groups. 
</P>
<P>
Several canvas sacks carry their messages right on the bag. The Earth Tote, for 
example, states: "Our landfills and garbage dumps cannot take any more PAPER OR 
PLASTIC! . . . Please Bring Your Own Bag." Shaped like a large grocery-bag, the 
$15 tote (at Stop and Look, Studio City) has padded canvas handles and is 
guaranteed for one year. A portion of the profits goes to an environmental 
group. It says so on the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Children of the Forest canvas bags, carried at all Westward Ho stores, urge 
shoppers to "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." The chain's buyer, Jeffrey Eisikowitz, 
says he initially rejected the idea of stocking the $9.95 bags. "But it's 
working. People really and truly bring them back. I thought they would just use 
them for the beach." Advertised capacity is 35 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Plan-It Bag doesn't say a lot, but it's decorated with a large globe and 
10% of the proceeds goes to environmental organizations. Three friends -- John 
Cherpas, Shirley Huling and Anna Huling -- created the ample (17x16x5 1/2) 
canvas bags for Earth Day and sold them at various events around Los Angeles. 
The trio is still in business and the totes, priced $10 each, three for $28.50, 
five for $45, can be orderd from Plan-It Bags, P.O. Box 2518, Venice, Calif. 
90241-2518. 
</P>
<P>
Esprit's chic silver-and-chartreuse shopping tote has the most forceful message 
of all. But it's discreet. An attached, fold-away silve rpouch is printed with 
an impassioned plea to "Question growth, question consumption, question 
progress because we are unquestionably destroying our own habitat . . ." This 
$30 response to "Paper or plastic?" is at the Esprit Super Store in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer to keep their convictions private, there are at least two 
choices. Trader Joe's heavy-duty canvas bags cost a thrifty $4.69. The 
time-honored colorful, capacious hand-woven straw bags with leather handles, 
imported from Kenya are available at Nordstrom for under $20 -- no message 
included. ROSE MARIE TURK

DEATH &amp; THE DOCTOR; 
</P>
<P>
DR. JACK KEVORKIAN HAS LONG TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE DYING. BUT DID HE GO TOO 
FAR IN ASSISTING A SUICIDE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PONTIAC, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was a bright young doctor at a time when America was just beginning its 
post-World War II ascent, and Jack Kevorkian, University of Michigan Medical 
School Class of 1952, could have -- should have -- had it all. 
</P>
<P>
But he had this nagging, inexplicable fascination with the dying and the dead, 
a personal obsession, really, one that was all the more peculiar because it 
first appeared during an optimistic era of limitless possibilities and 
unquestioning faith in the resiliency of American life. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was reinforced during his brief time as a U.S. Army doctor in Korea; 
certainly it was there during his residency at the University of Michigan 
Medical Center in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to take what I called death rounds," says Kevorkian, 62, his dark eyes 
flashing, remembering. "I would go around to all of the people (in the 
hospital) who were about to die and watch. I wanted to see at what point they 
could no longer be resuscitated. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other doctors laughed at me." 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, some leading physicians shudder at the thought of Kevorkian, 
his "death rounds" and his role in a controversial case of what he calls 
medically assisted suicide -- the death of a 54-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer 
from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Of Kevorkian's "death rounds," Dr. Charles McElwee, president of the Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn., observes: "I would never think of doing such a 
thing, that shows a morbid obsession with death." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Kevorkian denies his was obsessive behavior. He sees himself as a 
misunderstood, research pioneer. As a pathologist, after all, his professional 
work involved the study of death. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to watch someone die," he insists. "It is a traumatic, wrenching 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Yet through the years, his increasingly macabre, independent research and 
writing have always led him back to death. 
</P>
<P>
There was his early plan, first proposed during his medical school days and 
shunned by his professors, to "harvest" organs from prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
There were his experiments in taking blood transfusions from corpses, a 
practice now unacceptable in American medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he would advocate giving death-row prisoners the right to commit 
suicide -- with their organs then removed while comatose -- rather than face 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
He even wrote Op-Ed pieces in the Long Beach Press-Telegram supporting his 
ideas in the early 1980s, when he lived in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But the more his colleagues laughed -- or blanched -- at his ideas, the more 
determined he appeared to become. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed, as a Michigan prosecutor later said, "to revel in the role of 
outcast." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Kevorkian's obsession would cost him dearly. On the fringes of 
medicine, he would become permanently unemployed in his mid-50s -- rejected two 
years ago even for a job as a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
His only patients, he says, are acquaintances who stopped him in the street to 
ask his advice on minor ailments. He would complain that American medical 
journals refused to publish his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unemployable because of the controversy surrounding my work," he says. 
"The only thing protecting me right now is my M.D. degree." 
</P>
<P>
By the onset of the 1990s, Kevorkian had retreated into a private world. 
</P>
<P>
He took to comparing himself to Dr. Frankenstein -- a misunderstood genius, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical society is stuck in the Dark Ages," he would assert. "I'm sure if 
they could, they would burn me at the stake." 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong bachelor living off his savings in a tiny, ill-furnished, walk-up 
apartment in Royal Oak, Mich., not far from his boyhood home in Pontiac, he 
spent his solitary days in libraries, reading. His thoughts were increasingly 
dominated by the issue of suicide for the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
And so when Janet Adkins came to him earlier this month, eager to end her life, 
eager to stop the suffering of Alzheimer's disease before she became mentally 
incompetent, Kevorkian was ready. 
</P>
<P>
He had already traveled the slippery ethical slope that leads from medicine to 
euthanasia. In his own mind, he was no longer a practicing pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he printed up new business cards. On them, he called himself an 
"obitiatrist," with its root in the word "obituary": a doctor of death. "The 
world's first," he says. 
</P>
<P>
On June 4, Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old mother of three from Portland, Ore., 
climbed into the back of Kevorkian's rusting old Volkswagen van in a rural 
Michigan park not far from here and allowed Kevorkian to connect her to his 
homemade "suicide machine." 
</P>
<P>
She then pushed a button three times to ensure the machine's death-inducing 
drugs would course through her veins. "Thank you, thank you," were her last 
words, her neck arched as she beamed up at Kevorkian's face. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Kevorkian exploded into America's consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, his role in Adkins' "doctor-assisted" suicide had ignited an 
emotionally charged, nationwide debate over the right-to-die issue. 
</P>
<P>
Again, as throughout his career, Kevorkian has been condemned by the medical 
community since Adkins' death. 
</P>
<P>
"What he did is like veterinary medicine," insists Dr. John Finn, medical 
director of the Hospice of Southeastern Michigan in suburban Detroit, where 
some terminally ill patients have tried to seek out Kevorkian's services. "When 
you take your pet to the vet, he puts the pet to sleep. I think human beings 
are more complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should have his license revoked." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Melvin Kirschner, co-chairman of the joint committee on medical ethics of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. and the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., 
complains: "Kevorkian did this without any guidelines whatsoever. Physicians 
cannot just, willy-nilly, assist someone in killing themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Yet this time, Kevorkian has also struck a responsive chord within the growing 
right-to-die movement, which is being fueled by the nation's mounting distaste 
for medical technology that extends lives regardless of the suffering involved. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are free people at all, then we must be free to choose the manner of our 
death," argues Derek Humphry, executive director of the Hemlock Society, a 
Eugene, Ore.-based group that supports the idea of doctor-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
But even some of his supporters, such as Humphry, admit that Kevorkian is not 
the right man, not the right doctor, to try to set compassionate and safe 
guidelines for euthanasia in the future. He is too obsessed, too fanatical, in 
his interest in death and suicide, to offer direction for the nation. "He's a 
strange bird," acknowledges Humphry, who has met Kevorkian. "He's a zealot." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after a recent hearing related to Adkins' death, in which he both 
testified and acted as his own lawyer, Kevorkian's angry, arrogant and often 
scatological dialogue with the court on the issues of suicide and euthanasia 
gave credence to those who have insisted the doctor isn't the right man to play 
God. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing in Oakland County Circuit Court, in which a judge temporarily 
barred him from assisting in further suicides in Michigan, prosecutors 
suggested that Kevorkian wanted to become the "Domino's of Death," a deliverer 
of a quick, lethal new service to customers. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Adkins just happened to be an exciting test case for him. That 
was a bit unfair; Kevorkian didn't charge Adkins' family for his work. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have known Kevorkian professionally in the past, both in Michigan and 
Southern California, where he worked at several hospitals in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, remember a different man, a good doctor who was an accomplished 
organist and painter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very brilliant man," argues Dr. Fred Hodell, the former chief 
pathologist at Pacific Hospital in Long Beach, who hired Kevorkian as his 
assistant in 1981. "He was very friendly with people at the hospital, and I 
don't remember him talking about suicide. At the time he was more interested in 
organ transplants." 
</P>
<P>
Hodell adds that Kevorkian left Pacific on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite a character, but he was very fair to work for, he kept his word, 
and he backed us up if there was a problem," recalls Vince Hufanda, a medical 
technologist who worked for Kevorkian at Saratoga General Hospital in Detroit, 
where Kevorkian was director of the pathology lab in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But those who knew Kevorkian acknowledge that he still always stuck out as 
being a bit odd, a bit of a loner. While working as a staff pathologist at the 
Beverly Hills Medical Center in Los Angeles in the early 1980s, Kevorkian would 
often sleep overnight in the hospital parking lot, in the same 1968 VW van in 
which Adkins later ended her life. 
</P>
<P>
And his mind would latch onto gruesome tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"What I remember most is that, in his spare time, he invented a contraption 
that would cut up prostate tissue in the lab, so you wouldn't have to use a 
knife," recalls Trudy Staler, a lab technician at Beverly Hills Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In his work, Kevorkian remained restless, constantly on the move from one job 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he returned to Michigan and stopped working in his profession 
altogether; Pacific Hospital, which he left in 1982, was the last hospital in 
which he is known to have been employed. 
</P>
<P>
He was thus free to concentrate on his real life's work -- death. 
</P>
<P>
He remained largely out of sight until 1988, when he emerged in Los Angeles to 
make an outlandish offer to the Hemlock Society, a right-to-die group that was 
then backing a proposed ballot initiative for the legalization of 
physician-assisted suicide in California. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Humphry, the society's executive director, Kevorkian offered 
to set up an illegal "suicide clinic" for the terminally ill in Los Angeles. It 
would draw public attention to the proposed suicide initiative, which 
ultimately failed to get on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian, Humphry says, claimed not to be worried that he might be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Humphry rejected Kevorkian's offer. "The Hemlock Society is a law-abiding 
group" he says. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian returned home to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, he surfaced again, this time to offer to assist in the suicide of 
David Rivlin, a Michigan quadriplegic who had gone to court in a nationally 
publicized case to win the right to die. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Kevorkian was rebuffed, at least partly because he could not offer an 
easy means for physician-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
So after the Rivlin case, Kevorkian began work on his "suicide machine." He put 
his gift for gadgeteering to use, and, from parts he picked up at flea markets 
and garage sales, Kevorkian quickly developed a device that would intravenously 
feed coma- and death-inducing drugs to a patient, after the victim had pushed 
the machine's button. 
</P>
<P>
Untested machine in hand, it wasn't hard for Kevorkian to garner publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper stories about his device last year, and an appearance on the 
"Donahue" television show, were enough to attract willing subjects -- including 
Adkins. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the aftermath of her death, law enforcement officials are sifting 
through the evidence and are awaiting a final autopsy report to determine 
whether to bring charges against Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
That may be difficult. As Kevorkian noted in his court hearing, assisting in a 
suicide is not a crime in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kevorkian remains unrepentant and fully committed to his concept of 
"rational, planned death." If he is cleared of all charges and the court order 
against him is lifted, Kevorkian says he plans to establish an "obitorium," a 
suicide clinic. 
</P>
<P>
And, above all, he remains convinced that he knows what is best for society, 
and that eventually, his ideas will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm trying to do," says Kevorkian, "is condense the time between the birth 
of this idea, and its wide acceptance." 
</P>

BALANCING ACT TIPS SCALES IN HER FAVOR;

<P>
GYMNASTICS: A 'WORLD-CLASS BEAM ROUTINE' HAS HELPED ROBYN KING OF MISSION VIEJO 
MOVE UP TO THE ELITE DIVISION.

<P>
Thirteen-year-old Robyn King's friends and teammates at the Mission Viejo 
Gymnastics Club don't share her love for the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not unusual, according to King's coach, Barbara Davis. "Few gymnasts 
actually enjoy beam," Davis said. "If you watch gymnastics, no one ever smiles 
when they're doing beam." 
</P>
<P>
But King's fondness for the balance beam paid off May 27-28 in Seattle at the 
United States Gymnastics Federation National Championships, where she placed 
fourth on the balance beam and 12th overall in the Level 9 division, qualifying 
to move up two levels to the elite division from which Olympic gymnasts are 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
A gymnast can't fall very far during their floor routine, Davis said, and they 
can only fall once during the vault, but the balance beam presents a greater 
risk of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"She (King) has a good kinesthetic awareness in terms of where her own sense of 
center (of gravity)," Davis said. "Also, she has a calm, a nice calm that few 
people have." 
</P>
<P>
King's sense of calm may have failed her in December at her first national 
meet, the Holiday invitational in San Diego, where she fell three times during 
her beam routine. Davis said she began her club's competitive season at the 
invitational meet to put them immediately into a pressure situation and get 
them used to it as early as possible. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to have worked for King, who will be an eighth-grader in the fall at 
Newhart Junior High School in Mission Viejo. Davis was told by judges at the 
national championships that had it not been for one break in King's routine 
that cost her three-tenths of a point, she would have been the Level 9 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, she has a world-class beam routine," Davis said. "And that's where 
you want to be. You don't want to play catch-up on that routine." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis, Barbara's husband, coaches King on her floor routine. If King is to 
be a national contender in the elite division, Davis said she must improve in 
that event. 
</P>
<P>
"She has the potential," Barbara Davis said. "Our job now is to make her 
aggressive . . . I think we can do that without destroying her calm." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said it will take at least two years for King to reach world-class level 
because it will take that long for her to learn some of the more difficult 
compulsory skills required of elite gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
But although it will take time, Davis says she has faith in King and the way 
she trains. 
</P>
<P>
"She is so meticulous," Davis said. "I know she's going to have great 
compulsories." 
</P>
<P>
And the "calm" that the Davises say leads to King's success is unlikely to be 
tested by parental pressure, which Barbara Davis says can ruin a young gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches put pressure (on the gymnast) and they put pressure on 
themselves," said Davis. "And if their parents put pressure on them, sometimes 
they break." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Robyn's parents, Jack and Susan King, do not push their daughter too 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
"We started it for fun," Susan King said, "and it became a little more and a 
little more until she's doing it six days a week." 
</P>
<P>
King said her daughter practices four hours a day for those six days and also 
carries a course load of excelled classes at Newhart Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always been a hard worker," King said. 
</P>
<P>
And Barbara Davis appreciates that. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants it," said Davis. "She has the desire and that's the thing. I'd 
rather work with someone who doesn't have the talent but has the desire."

Our plate is full today with questions about John Thompson. Why would he be 
interested in becoming general manager at Denver? Why would Denver want him? If 
he goes, what would it mean for Georgetown? 
</P>
<P>
This is no frivolous colloquy. Through the years Thompson has been offered 
numerous college and NBA jobs. This week, he conceded he's considering Denver's 
proposal "far more seriously than any of the others." So let's first discuss 
some underlying reasons Thompson might consider leaving. 
</P>
<P>
1. He has accomplished everything he can at Georgetown. His stature within 
college basketball is immense. He has won the national title, and been elected 
president of the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches. If Thompson stays, his 
ground has been plowed before; repetition isn't a lesser goal, but it's the 
familiar one. Whether here or at Denver, he won't get the opportunity to avenge 
the one blemish on his record -- the Olympic defeat in 1988. Now is as good a 
time as any to move on, on top, before a fickle public begins wondering why the 
Alonzo Mourning teams are falling short of the Patrick Ewing teams. 
</P>
<P>
2. There's a new president at Georgetown. Timothy Healy was John Thompson's 
staunchest advocate. When Healy left perhaps a piece of Thompson left with him. 
</P>
<P>
3. Thompson is collaborating on an autobiography. Some of the things he may 
want to say about college basketball might sound better from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
4. Thompson suffers from hypertension, and there are less-stressful ways to 
make a living than coaching big-time college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
These are conditions that might prompt Thompson to entertain an offer. But why 
this offer? 
</P>
<P>
The Denver team is black-owned, the only major sports franchise in America that 
is. Thompson has a high profile within the black community; he's regarded 
almost reverentially. He is not unwilling to be a pioneer, and he has a strong 
sense of the kinds of incremental steps that advance equality. For him to take 
this job, and align himself with black economic progress, might appeal to him 
culturally and politically. The NBA is going global. It can give a thoughtful, 
intelligent man like Thompson a big stage to play on. 
</P>
<P>
Denver is offering Thompson 4 percent ownership. (Dave Gavitt was enticed to 
Boston under similar circumstances; Chuck Daly is said to be in line for 
something comparable at Philadelphia.) 
</P>
<P>
Five years from now, when Thompson's contract is up, the Nuggets are likely to 
be worth $100 million. His share -- his free share -- would be $4 million. Nice 
work if you can get it. The $700,000 yearly salary is up a bit from what 
Thompson makes now. Still available are extracurricular earnings from lectures 
and as a spokesman for Nike. Thompson is a capitalist with a sincere respect 
for money. There's a lot of it there to respect. This week, Thompson was asked 
if owning a piece of the Nuggets excited him. He grinned and said, "It excites 
me. It excites the hell out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Denver also is offering Thompson total control of the basketball operation, 
which satisfies a critical aspect of his personality. He has total control at 
Georgetown; he had total control at the Olympics. He'll accept no less. It's 
why he declined previous NBA offers. "What I have always asked is, 'Will I have 
control? Will I have control?' " Denver said, absolutely. (Denver also is close 
to Las Vegas, where Thompson recently bought property.) 
</P>
<P>
Giving up coaching will not torment Thompson. He compared being a pro GM to 
being a college coach: "You develop the personnel; you bring them to the team." 
Realistically, Thompson's signature coaching style, which stresses frenetic 
defense and self-sacrifice, is a difficult fit in the NBA -- the Pistons' 
muscular defense is the notable exception, not the rule. The NBA rewards 
offense. Referees overwhelmingly call blocking fouls rather than charges. And 
most NBA players would resent any philosophy that wasn't predicated on their 
individual creativities. But Thompson doesn't want to be GM and coach. "That's 
suicide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Why would Denver want Thompson? 
</P>
<P>
Because he knows basketball. Because he has been exceedingly successful as an 
administrator and leader of a basketball program. Because he is a symbol of 
success and integrity to black people throughout America, a role model whether 
he likes it or not, a moral force in a sport that sorely needs it. 
</P>
<P>
Their gamble, though, is that Thompson can succeed at pro basketball, a 
different game from the one he's used to. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson dismisses any alleged gap, saying, "I believe intelligent people who 
work hard can adjust." His own career attests to his ability to climb the 
ladder acrobatically. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Georgetown if Thompson leaves? 
</P>
<P>
I suspect it plummets. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown is one of the country's pre-eminent programs, with North Carolina 
and Indiana. (Duke is on a rocket now, but Mike Krzyzewski's tenure is brief in 
comparison.) But Thompson's influence at his school is greater than Dean 
Smith's or Bobby Knight's. Smith and Knight have developed assistants who have 
left the nest and become successful head coaches elsewhere -- people who can be 
passed the torch. Eddie Fogler and Roy Williams assisted El Deano. Krzyzewski 
and Jim Crews assisted Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson has produced no such logical heirs. He has kept Craig Esherick and 
Mike Riley with him. They have not developed their own coaching personality, to 
say nothing of an imprimatur. From soup to nuts, John Thompson is Georgetown 
basketball, a larger-than-life figure -- provocative, intriguing, 
controversial. Inadvertently, his need for control reduced the size of everyone 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson feels great loyalty to people who have been loyal to him. He is said 
to be trying to place Esherick or Riley to succeed him, and either would have 
to take it; nobody passes up a chance to coach Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, 
both of whom could be the first player taken in the NBA draft. But following a 
legend is a cobbled row to hoe; Gene Bartow found out at UCLA how bumpy it can 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Without Thompson to close the deal, recruiting will be much more difficult at 
Georgetown. A white coach won't have the entree Thompson does. A black coach 
may find life uneasy in Thompson's shadow. Georgetown's next coach may not last 
long. If Thompson leaves, the spot where everyone wants to sit is second, 
behind the poor guy with his head on the block.

ALAN TRAMMELL AND LOU WHITAKER HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS FOR THE TIGERS 
FOR 13 SEASONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Theirs is a union of circumstance and fate, a marriage celebrated on a diamond 
instead of with one. 
</P>
<P>
To put in perspective the partnership of second baseman Lou Whitaker and 
shortstop Alan Trammell, consider this: The Detroit Tigers have had one 
double-play combination since the two were summoned from Montgomery, Ala., of 
the Southern League and made their major league debut in the second game of a 
doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox on Sept. 9, 1977. The New York Yankees, 
in that span, have changed managers 17 times. 
</P>
<P>
Other players may change allegiances in pursuit of riches, but Whitaker and 
Trammell remain a constant and reassuring sight in the Tigers' infield. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both very proud that we're the longest running double-play combination," 
said Trammell, a Garden Grove native who grew up in San Diego, a continent away 
from Whitaker's home in Martinsville, Va. "To me, to have two positions open at 
the same time, that's so highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
Paired almost accidentally in the minor leagues, where Whitaker began as a 
third baseman and was shifted to second because the Tigers were deep at third, 
the players are linked for posterity. Their 13-year tenure is the longest for 
any double-play combination in major league history, longer than the 11-year 
pairing of Johnny Evers and Joe Tinker, who combined with first baseman Frank 
Chance to form the Chicago Cubs' fabled infield early in the century; longer 
than Davey Lopes' and Bill Russell's partnership with the Dodgers from 1972 to 
'81. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual," said Sparky Anderson, who is the American League's senior 
manager with more than 11 years' service, but who stands second in seniority on 
his own team to his double-play combination. "I don't believe you'll see it 
again because of free agency and all the other factors in the game today." 
</P>
<P>
Both infielders appreciate their accomplishment, but they deem it so natural a 
part of their baseball lives that Whitaker was surprised to be asked about it 
last week, during a season in which Tiger outfielder Cecil Fielder is leading 
the major leagues in home runs and runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"You know who I am?" Whitaker asked. "You know I'm not Cecil? Most people 
coming around here are looking for Cecil." 
</P>
<P>
There's still ample reason to look at -- and to -- Trammell and Whitaker, who 
lead the revived Tigers into Anaheim Stadium tonight for a four-game series 
against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Although Whitaker is struggling with an average of .193, his nine homers are 
second on the Tigers behind Fielder's 25 and he has 25 RBIs. He hit .251 last 
season, far below his career average of .276, but he led the Tigers with 28 
homers (a club record for second basemen), had a career-high 85 RBIs and was 
the only AL second baseman to exceed 25 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll straighten out," Anderson said. "I'm not worried about that." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Whitaker, who continues to be serenaded at Tiger Stadium with cries of 
"L-o-o-o-o-u," with nary a "Boo" among them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very pleasant career for me, even if this year is a little 
difficult," said Whitaker, who wears a brace to keep his balky back warm. "I 
still enjoy baseball. I'm still putting the numbers together, but my average is 
pitiful, pathetic. But I'm going to make it. I'm going to survive this thing. 
I'm a Tiger -- I'm going to claw my way back up this tree until I get back on 
top. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in jinxes, but this is year number 13 for us." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen has been lucky for Trammell, a career .286 hitter who has hit .300 or 
better five times and was the runner-up to Toronto's George Bell in voting for 
the American League's most valuable player award in 1987 with a .343 average, 
28 home runs and 105 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has raised his batting average to .307 by hitting in nine of 
his last 10 games. He has driven in 10 runs in his last 11 games for a total of 
43, one short of his injury-riddled 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"Trammell will be in the Hall of Fame; there's no way you can stop him," 
Anderson said. "He'll have the numbers, the average, the runs scored." 
</P>
<P>
So much respect does Trammell command among opponents that Oakland Manager Tony 
La Russa decided to walk him with a one-run lead in the fourth inning Tuesday 
and pitch to Fielder, who hit a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
"When you break it down, you're really looking at two guys who've been our 
biggest producers and they're middle men," Anderson said. "You don't expect to 
get that kind of hitting out of those positions, but they've given us that and 
strength up the middle defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, a three-time Gold Glove winner and four-time All-Star, has committed 
only one error this season; Trammell, a four-time Gold Glove winner and 
five-time All-Star, has made five. The St. Louis Cardinals' Ozzie Smith is a 
more acrobatic shortstop, and Baltimore Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken has played 
more consecutive games than anyone except Lou Gehrig, but for reliability and 
consistency, Trammell and Whitaker are second to none. 
</P>
<P>
"I had (Dave) Concepcion and (Joe) Morgan, and I had Trammell and Whitaker," 
said Anderson, who managed Concepcion and Hall of Famer Morgan in the heyday of 
Cincinnati's Big Red Machine. "I'm not going to argue over which of the two are 
better, because they each have their own merits." 
</P>
<P>
So like a marriage is the bond shared by Whitaker and Trammell that each knows 
what the other is doing, and each can finish the other's sentences. It may be 
fitting, then, that the wedge most likely to split them is marriage.

Although Anderson said he believes the pair could play together for perhaps 
another six years, Whitaker laughed at the thought. Both are signed through 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my wife will let me play that much longer; after 15 years of 
being away from my family, that might be enough," said Whitaker, who is married 
to a former fashion model and is the father of four daughters ranging in age 
from 9 years to 4 months. "When I've mentioned it a few times, I say, 'Maybe 
I'll play one more year than I already have on the contract,' (and) she says, 
'Whaaat?' 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm away, she's had to be the mom and the dad. She's had enough of that 
stuff, and I have to take that into consideration. It's my career, but my 
family's important to me. We could play six more years, but I don't think 
that's going to set too well. There's a lot of money to be made, and some 
people say, 'How can you quit baseball, because you'll never make so much money 
doing anything else?' But after I signed that last contract, I thought that 
would be enough baseball. I can't go back on my word. She'd be a little put 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The notion of playing well into the 1990s appealed to Trammell, nine months 
younger than Whitaker, who turned 33 last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say we'll play together forever, but of course, that's not 
realistic," Trammell said. "It's difficult to speculate. I'd certainly like to 
play that long, but I can't foresee that far down the road. A lot will have to 
do with this team. There's some rebuilding going on and a lot of new faces 
coming in. If we don't win, the older players could be gone. They might not 
want us." 
</P>
<P>
That's difficult to believe of the pair Anderson called "probably our biggest 
offensive thrust for the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
It was impossible for anyone who saw Trammell and Whitaker in the minor leagues 
to know they would be this successful. Even Anderson wasn't all that impressed 
when he saw them before they were established in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubted their hitting. I was just wondering if they'd hit well enough," he 
said. "When they hit, it sounded like balsa wood because they didn't hit it 
very hard. They were great-looking fielders, though." 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker played third base for two years in Detroit's minor league system 
before the Tigers, who had third baseman Aurelio Rodriguez, asked him to play 
second base, with Trammell at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit hesitant, but once I made up my mind, I forgot how to play 
third base," said Whitaker, who learned his new position well enough to be 
named the 1978 AL rookie of the year. "Tram always played shortstop, but I was 
learning how to play a new position. It was a little scary, and I thought, if 
anything, it might hurt me -- trying to make the major leagues and moving into 
a new position. It was like starting all over again, I thought. But I always 
had the desire to make it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We just went out and played together and enjoyed it. We ran away with the 
Southern League (in 1977). We had good pitching and good defensive players, and 
that made me more at ease when I was playing." 
</P>
<P>
In playing together so long, they have learned how to turn a double play 
without looking or communicating, a feat more difficult than it sounds. And 
although they may be outdone by others in flash and dash, they have persevered 
through prosperous and poor times with the Tigers, twice playing in the AL 
playoffs and earning World Series rings in 1984. Trammell was named the Series 
MVP for his .450 batting average, two home runs and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell leaves the superlatives to others when analyzing his and Whitaker's 
success. For him, it's simple. 
</P>
<P>
"We've both done the job," Trammell said. "That's the reason we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, Trammell and the Tigers aren't just existing -- they're thriving. 
Detroit has surged into contention in the weak AL East, dramatically reversing 
its 103-loss season of 1989. If the Tigers make it to the top, it's certain 
Whitaker and Trammell will be leading the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having some fun," Whitaker said. "Guys are having good years here, the 
pitchers are starting to build their confidence level, and the relief pitchers 
are doing a great job. Cecil's doing his thing, and we're doing our part, 
getting on base and coming up with big hits. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I've come through when we've needed it, had some good games when the big guy 
(Fielder) wasn't hitting. We're getting a lot of people hitting. It's a team, 
not a one-man band. We've got an orchestra."
