SO WHO'S LAUGHING NOW?; 
</P>
<P>
* HARD-LINERS WIN, PEACE LOSES WITH BUSH'S UNAVOIDABLE PLO CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only the hard-liners in the Middle East can be happy right now. No doubt 
President Bush's decision to suspend talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization fills many of them with the wicked glee that comes from observing 
mindless destruction. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that the limp peace process orchestrated by Washington wasn't getting 
far: 18 months of desultory chats, mainly for show, between the American 
ambassador in Tunis and a PLO representative, combined with bitter wrangling 
between Washington and Jerusalem and unapologetic foot-dragging from Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
But now the risk is that the tension will intensify and the region will slide 
toward war. This is why low-level talks with the PLO were better than no talks 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
But when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat could not bring himself to repudiate the 
unsuccessful terrorist raid on an Israeli beach last month, engineered by 
poisonous anti-American PLO hard-liners, President Bush made the inescapable 
call -- while couching it in the least dire terms. By selecting suspension 
rather than flat cancellation he pointedly left open to Arafat the option of 
condemning the raid and disciplining the PLO perpetrators within his own 
executive council in order to re-start talks with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have from the Bush Administration a serious commitment to a 
peace process in which they would be wholly included, and in which the Israelis 
would not be permitted to call every major shot. Arafat &amp; Co. are not 
likely to get a better deck of cards to play with from Washington than they are 
getting from Bush and his secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Turning now against PLO Executive Committee member and terrorist Abul Abbas 
will not be easy for Arafat and his allies. But this is the only way out of the 
corner that the PLO painted itself into when it originally agreed to talks on 
condition that it renounce terrorism -- and 18 months later failed to deliver 
on its part of the deal.

KIRKPATRICK ON DEMOCRACY IN A CHANGING SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeane Kirkpatrick seems to like the word "democracy." She uses it or a 
derivative six times in her column ("A Color-Blind Peace Depends on Democracy," 
Commentary, June 11): I do not know what her definition of democracy is. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure that most of the people of the world including those in South Africa 
have little idea of the meaning, advantages and responsibilities of a 
democratic government. Kirkpatrick speaks of "democracy and comfort for 
whites." Does she equate privilege with democracy? If there is no privilege, 
will there be no democracy? 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick failed to tell us of the relative sizes of the constituencies of 
African National Congress (ANC), Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and Inkatha. In 
her words "PAC (is) a rapidly growing black-consciousness party." She calls ANC 
"a Marxist-style national liberation group" and "a fundamentally Leninist 
liberation movement." She refers to Inkatha as "a Zulu-based democratic party," 
(that) "emphasizes nonviolence, pluralism and the market economy." Her use of 
the phrase "market economy" leads me to believe her main interest is a stable 
society where a person can engage in profitable activities and not be too 
concerned with "liberation movements." 
</P>
<P>
I am not a wholehearted supporter of the ANC, although I feel some sympathy 
because I believe that it was born out of the blood, sweat, tears and deaths of 
its members. Is Inkatha a creature of our people? If it fails is the PAC a 
fallback position? I don't think Kirkpatrick is willing or qualified to answer 
these questions. Certainly, The Times has someone who has been there and can 
enlighten us.

HOW TO ANSWER THE CRY FOR HELP; 
</P>
<P>
* FOR NOW HUMANITARIAN AID IS BEST BET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union makes no secret of its urgent interest in getting aid from the 
West. Its officials warn that without massive assistance the country's 
stagnating economy could collapse, pulling down with it President Mikhail 
Gorbachev and his plans for reform and crushing the great hopes that have been 
raised for a calmer and more stable international order. 
</P>
<P>
That argument has won a sympathetic hearing in Europe, especially in France and 
West Germany, whose leaders plan to raise the aid issue at next month's 
seven-nation Western economic summit meeting in Houston. President Bush, who 
heretofore has scoffed at the notion of Western aid for Moscow, now indicates 
he's at least ready to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there's a case to be made that strictly in its own self-interest, the 
West should do what it can to try to head off a Soviet economic collapse. 
What's at issue is not saving communism, which is sick beyond any hope of 
revival, but a chance to forestall threatened domestic turmoil and its probable 
consequences, including the re-emergence of regressive rule in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Few would dispute the value of doing what can be done to help Soviet reformers 
gain time to effect changes, especially given the probable alternative. For if 
efforts to replace a thoroughly discredited system fail, if the reformers can't 
deliver, there's little doubt that it would be the most brutal and reactionary 
elements in Soviet society who would move to seize power, reimposing with 
whatever violence was needed the full and terrible weight of state tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly might be done by Western donors? 
</P>
<P>
Firm ideas are scarce for now, although it's probable that at least a European 
consensus could take shape by the time of the Houston summit. Any U.S. 
contribution, given economic realities, would almost surely have to be limited 
to food and other humanitarian help. Far clearer is what the Soviets must do if 
they expect to invite significant outside aid. The major need is for bolder 
steps toward a reasonably true -- not a "regulated" -- market economy. Without 
such structural changes it's inevitable that much if not most of any foreign 
aid given would be devoured by inefficiency and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is right in insisting on a second condition: It would make no 
sense for Western donors to deliver money or resources through the Soviet 
Union's front door, while out the back door an estimated $5 billion in annual 
support continues to flow to Cuba. If the Soviets expect Western help, that 
subsidy has to stop. Congress, which must repeal or suspend certain laws before 
U.S. aid would be possible, undoubtedly shares that view. 
</P>
<P>
What are the chances of a Western aid program for the Soviet Union? Better now, 
certainly, than at any time since World War II. But there's still a lot to be 
done on both sides before that idea becomes a reality.

BRAND NEW HOME FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles suffers from a severe shortage of affordable housing. Poor 
families, as many as 300,000 of them, are spending more than half of their 
meager incomes to share overcrowded, squalid or unsafe quarters. The worsening 
crisis warrants new leadership, which Mayor Bradley is expected to provide 
today with the creation of a city Housing Preservation and Production 
Department and a Commission on Affordable Housing. 
</P>
<P>
One hopes that this new partnership will maximize public resources, eliminate 
duplication and give the housing crisis even greater visibility at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the new department will take over housing responsibilities from 
the city's troubled Community Development Department, an agency that also has 
had to provide job training, social services and housing assistance. Housing 
services often got lost in the shuffle of that hodgepodge. 
</P>
<P>
The new department's budget will be funded from federal block grant money, rent 
stabilization fees and proceeds from bonds. It is expected to top $50 million 
for the first year. Much more money is needed. 
</P>
<P>
That housing budget could double if the mayor and city council set a fee on 
commercial development. In Los Angeles, the amount will be determined by a 
study due in two months. If set at $5 per square foot, as some propose, the 
linkage fee could generate $50 million a year for housing. Fees linking 
commercial and residential development are used in San Francisco and Boston. 
The rationale is simple: New office buildings, hotels and stores require 
employees who need places to live. 
</P>
<P>
The city housing department will implement policies set by the new Affordable 
Housing Commission, a panel of seven members appointed by the mayor and the 
president of the council. The commission will determine priorities, encourage 
aggressive lobbying for scarce federal housing dollars and generate greater 
support for nonprofit housing developers. 
</P>
<P>
The new department and commission face a tough challenge. Thousands of poor 
families, senior citizens and homeless people need a decent place to live -- 
today.

LETHAL THREAT BEYOND QUICK FIXES; 
</P>
<P>
LIBYA'S CHEMICAL PLANTS ARE A THREAT, BUT IRAQ'S MALEVOLENCE AND REGIONAL 
PROLIFERATION ARE OF SPECIAL URGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN L. SPIEGEL, Steven L. Spiegel is a professor of political science at 
UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breathtaking reports from Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe, the Soviet 
Union, Nicaragua and even South Africa might lead us to assume that "peace is 
breaking out all over." The "victory" of the United States in the Cold War has 
led many American analysts to predict a diminished need for American activity 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
These positive developments have dulled our sensitivities to a major new peril 
with global implications emerging almost under our noses -- the proliferation 
of chemical and biological weapons, long-range missiles and the potential 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Now the State Department has acknowledged 
that Libya, already identified as the manufacturer of poison gas, may be at 
work on a second chemical weapons factory. 
</P>
<P>
These horrifying arms in the hands of the erratic and unpredictable Moammar 
Kadafi, with his long record of support for terrorism and general international 
trouble-making, are particularly jarring. This latest development may lead to a 
new round of Libyamania, but the problem is deeper and broader because several 
countries in the Middle East are busily moving to develop comparable weapons of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
As dangerous as Kadafi may be, he is not the cause of greatest immediate 
concern. Saddam Hussein of Iraq has announced that if Israel tries to destroy 
his rebuilt nuclear reactor, he will rain chemical weapons over the Jewish 
state. His threats are credible. Hussein employed chemical weapons and 
long-range missiles against Iran in the late stages of their war, thereby 
helping to persuade the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to agree to a cease fire. 
Then Hussein turned his chemical weapons against rebellious Kurdish residents 
of his own country. This act, violating a widely accepted taboo since World War 
I, was greeted with muted condemnation and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
What has the United States done in response to these horrifying new dangers? We 
have protested, expressed our revulsion, talked with our allies and "dialogued" 
with the Soviets. In other words, we have been on the side of the angels. But 
angels don't take concrete actions in the real world. If we fail to develop 
dramatic, concerted and effective steps soon, it is only a matter of time until 
these weapons are used in the Middle East. They could be used against civilians 
-- including Americans who happen to be there. The Iraqis are demonstrating 
that these weapons can enhance a state's prestige. If Middle Eastern states can 
get away with their deployment and perhaps even their use, it is only a matter 
of time until nations in other parts of the world develop similar weapons. 
</P>
<P>
What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
We must first increase the priority of the issue. The President and the 
secretary of state must raise the matter more dramatically and more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
And we must stop being soft on Iraq. Our intervention in the Persian Gulf was a 
decisive factor in Iraq's successes late in its war with Iran. We thereby 
helped put Saddam Hussein in the strengthened military position that he enjoys 
today. Yet our protestations about his recent actions have resulted only in a 
deterioration of relations with Baghdad. We must demonstrate that we mean 
business about these lethal weapons by cutting off all credits and assistance 
we now provide Hussein's regime. The Bush Administration has thus far opposed 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
We should also increase the pressure on Iraq by moving with greater vigor to 
improve relations with Iran, starting with a major relief offer for Thursday's 
devastating quake. The Iran-Contra affair and the sorry Iranian record on 
hostages have given overtures to Iran a bad name. But the growing threat from 
the proliferation of weapons in the region is a matter of far greater impact. 
Saddam Hussein enjoys his current level of prestige because he has managed to 
pretend that Iran has been defeated and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
America should raise efforts to begin regional arms-control negotiations to a 
status equal to our efforts to achieve an Arab-Israeli settlement. At the same 
time, we must accelerate our programs for controlling arms transfers and 
assistance from private European companies and new arms suppliers such as 
Brazil, China and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we must understand that quick fixes will not work. The Israeli attack 
on Iraq's nuclear reactor in June, 1981, and the American punitive attack on 
Kadafi's headquarters in April, 1986, both served to inhibit the actions of 
these regimes until they devised new ways of proceeding with weapons 
developments and terrorist activities. Subversion and selective military 
strikes may be useful under certain circumstances, but they are no substitute 
for a coordinated high-level program to combat this growing danger. 
</P>
<P>
If Libya's reported new plant mobil- izes us into action, we should be 
grateful. We need a program to counter these new weapons and we need it now.

THE 'LUNGS OF THE PLANET' ARE IMPERILED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BUSH'S DESIRE TO OPEN NEW OIL DRILLING OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS 
DANGEROUS. ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND SHOULD BE TAPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT H. SULNICK, Robert H. Sulnick is executive director of American 
Oceans Campaign, based in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, we were seduced by oil. The 
thick, black substance powered our inventions. It made our economy grow. We had 
no idea that oil was an environmental poison that would one day pollute our air 
and threaten to spoil our oceans. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, we learned that certain properties of oil are uncontrollable: No 
amount of preparation and care can prevent a well blowout. California's Supreme 
Court enshrined that fact by declaring oil drilling on land and on sea an 
ultra-hazardous activity. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, we began to see and feel the effects of an oil-based economy. 
Smog began to get our lungs' attention. At the end of the 1960s, we were 
shocked and saddened by the waves of dead marine life caused by the Santa 
Barbara oil spill. Nevertheless, the politics of oil moved out to sea in the 
1980s: President Ronald Reagan, for the first time in history, opened the 
entire coastline of America to the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
The oceans are the lungs of the planet, the main source of our oxygen. They 
play a crucial role in shaping our climate. It is in the coastal zones where 
the life force of the ocean germinates and breeds. Spilling oil, a toxin, into 
them is analogous to injecting poison into a person's veins. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need to put our coastal resources at risk. There are alternatives 
that are technologically feasible and readily available. All that's needed is 
political will. 
</P>
<P>
But President Bush remains wedded to an offshore oil policy that envisions oil 
fields in Southern California waters. The announcement is expected shortly. His 
perseverance in promoting a 19th-Century energy source is dangerous and 
environmentally reckless. 
</P>
<P>
At the current rate of consumption, the world's oil supplies will be exhausted 
in about 100 years. Why cling to this dwindling energy source that poisons our 
habitat? California's and the country's continuing energy need does not mean 
that offshore oil development is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The 21st Century will be fueled by conservation and by clean, renewable fuels. 
The only question is whether we will sentence our grandchildren to a frantic, 
polluted world that is desperately trying to develop a 
renewable-fuels/conservation economy or begin preparing now to shift away from 
fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the city and county of Los Angeles use methanol to power their fleets of 
cars. Southern California Edison uses electricity to keep its vans going. The 
Southern California Gas Co. runs trucks on compressed natural gas. We can -- 
and should -- develop vehicles that run on ethanol (made from corn). The sun, 
after all, could supply much of the world's energy. 
</P>
<P>
We also have the technology to conserve billions of barrels of oil as we move 
to a renewable-fuels economy. We can make automobiles that are capable of 
getting 107 miles per gallon; many cars sold today get 50 m.p.g. Yet President 
Bush, as did his predecessor, continues to embrace the 1985 fleet standard of 
27.5 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
If we raised that fleet average to 40 m.p.g. by the year 2000, we could save 
four times the amount of oil that is estimated to be off the Atlantic and 
Pacific coasts. If the nation's households installed storm windows and 
insulation during the next decade, we could save twice the oil offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The battle to drill for oil in the ocean must end, for a healthy, living ocean 
is essential to the planet's well-being. If an oil field is developed off 
Southern California, the probability of a major oil spill occurring in the area 
is 94%. It is certain, too, that we would have many more oil tankers in 
Southern California's waters, because the the Coastal Commission, the State 
Lands Commission and the affected municipalities are not going to approve 
pipelines to move the oil 
</P>
<P>
Californians do not want to go to the beach and see an oil field. What we do 
want is an energy policy that protects our coastal resources. We can have both 
energy and an unpolluted environment. It is time for the government and the oil 
industry to join with the environmental community in developing a 
renewable-fuels/conservation energy policy that guarantees both the integrity 
of the ocean and the well-being of the Earth's environment.

<P>
Blue-chip stocks sprang into the plus column Thursday, with the Dow Jones 
industrials edging back through the 2,900 level, spurred by a late burst of 
buying by computer-guided traders and a firm bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down about 15 at mid-session, finished 
with a plus-6.43 reading at 2,901.73. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 774 up, 696 down and 539 
unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 138.57 million shares, against Wednesday's 
137.42 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said buying interest improved after the Dow edged into the plus side 
and over 2,900, which has been a resistance point. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks had fallen earlier in the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan said he does not see a U.S. credit squeeze, which heightened 
pessimism about immediate cuts in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the upward revision in first-quarter U.S. gross national product 
also added to the conviction that the Fed won't trim interest rates. GNP was 
revised to a gain of 1.9% at an annual rate from 1.3% in the original estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Still, investors who have been waiting to get into stocks managed to outnumber 
the interest rate pessimists. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 7/8 at 44 3/8; 
Westinghouse, up 7/8 to 37 3/8, and IBM, up 1 1/8 to 119 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 2 to 66 5/8. The FDA approved a J &amp; J drug for 
treating colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
VF Corp. fell 2 1/4 to 25. The firm projected a 47% decline in second-quarter 
earnings, citing "sales shortfalls" in its Jantzen sportswear and casual 
clothing operation and weak orders for jeans wear. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas plunged 3 3/4 to 35 3/4, continuing to slide on worries about 
the company's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller stocks continued to be strong. The NASDAQ over-the-counter industrial 
index rose 1.71 to 495.18. OTC gainers included Apple Computer, up 1 7/8 to 41 
7/8, Mentor Graphic, up 1 1/8 to 22 3/8, and Amgen, up 1 to 76 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Some very small Southland stocks also advanced, suggesting that more individual 
investors are entering the market. Bridgford Foods rose 1 to 21, Barry's 
Jewelers gained 1 to 7 and Birtcher Corp. rose 1/2 to 5 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
But Software Toolworks continued its decline, falling 1 1/2 to 18 7/8. The 
company's outlook was hit in a recent Barron's article. 
</P>
<P>
Avery International lost 1/2 to 24, despite a company announcement that its 
second-half results should be stronger than first-half results. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed almost unchanged. The Nikkei average lost a mere 0.49 
points to 32,087.27. In London, shares closed a shade lower. The Financial 
Times 100-share index ended down 0.9 points at 2,370.3. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, however, a buying spree continued for a third day. The 30-share 
DAX index ended up 14.02 points at 1,863.55. The two Germanys on Thursday 
formally agreed to unification.

</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, gaining against the yen 
but falling against the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the mark advanced on news that East German lawmakers 
overwhelmingly had approved a historic economic merger with West Germany, the 
most difficult step toward unifying the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against the British pound after sterling rose overseas. In 
London, the pound rose to $1.7255 from $1.7225 late Wednesday. In New York, the 
pound was quoted at $1.7200, down from $1.7220 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold advanced domestically and overseas. At Republic National Bank in New York, 
gold bullion rose 30 cents an ounce to $349.90.

<P>
Government bond prices rose as buying interest picked up after a four-day

<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which lost 13/32 point Wednesday, rose 
5/16 point, or about $3.13 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield fell to 8.49% from

Avery International Corp.: The Pasadena firm said second-quarter profit fell 
12% to $21.1 million. Sales totaled $470 million, up 5% from the same period a 
year ago. The company, which makes self-adhesive base materials, labels and 
tapes, said profit was affected by market development costs in the European 
materials business and the slowdown in the U.S. retail department store market.

RECYCLING WOES ARE JUST PLAIN GARBAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How could you print such a negative article when we are all doing our best to 
make recycling a success? 
</P>
<P>
I cannot believe recycling can be the chore Kennedy purports it to be. 
</P>
<P>
She and her nine housemates are all obviously young men and women since most of 
them are students. They, of all people, should be ready, willing and able to do 
their part in making our world a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
If we senior citizens can make the effort and take the time to recycle our 
papers, glass and plastic, surely the younger generation can do the same. I 
rest my case.

DITCH DAY A DELIGHT, NOT A TRANSGRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Let's Get Lost" (June 13): As a great-grandmother, I am far removed from 
the school scene and not aware of what today's high school students are up to 
other than the really grim things that make headlines. 
</P>
<P>
I was actually delighted to know ditch days still happen. 
</P>
<P>
Traditions are good; they give us continuity and meaning. To me, ditch day was 
a memorable, innocent adventure. It took great courage, which I seldom had, 
just to tell my parents what I was doing. I did tell them, and I had no written 
excuse in which my parents would have had to lie. I faced the girls' vice 
principal on Monday morning, and whatever punishment I received, I felt was 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
I faced the same situation with my son at Hollywood High, only they would not 
allow him back in school until I saw the principal. I explained to him that my 
son had ditched with my permission as a tradition, and I had refused to write a 
phony excuse. I was told they were preparing to withhold his diploma. We went 
to his graduation not knowing whether he would receive his diploma. He did.

Is there a possibility of violence in your boomers versus busters scenario? The

Can civil war be very far off?

How much time will pass before it is parents against child, brother against

DRIVING HOME NEED FOR ALTERNATIVES TO CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many thanks for Connie Koenenn's inspiring story on people choosing to give up 
their cars for more sustainable and healthful modes of transportation 
("Shifting Gears," June 19). 
</P>
<P>
I tell folks quite regularly that switching to sustainable (non-fossil-fueled) 
transportation is going to be one of our next big movements for social and 
environmental change. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, people just laugh at that. After all, we are the car-consuming capital 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
I'm pleased that now I'll have something in print proving that lots of ordinary 
folks are making the extraordinary choice simply to do what's sensible for 
personal and planetary health.

TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY FOR BLYLEVEN, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bert Blyleven has made himself the Angels' resident olfactory expert this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Back when the Angels were having trouble scoring runs, he announced to the 
world that the offense "stinks." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't spare himself the accusing finger either, posting a note to reporters 
reading "I STUNK TODAY," after a loss last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Detroit Tigers Thursday, both Blyleven and the Angel offense 
smelled good for a while, taking a six-run lead en route to a 6-4 victory 
before 26,462 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who had a one-hit shutout through five innings, gave up two runs on 
five hits and left after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
When reliever Mark Eichhorn gave up two runs in the ninth and brought the tying 
run to the plate, there was a hint of unpleasantness. But Bryan Harvey came on 
to get pinch-hitter Dave Bergman to pop to left for the final out for his 10th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
The third-place Angels have won four of their past five games and moved to 9 
1/2 games behind AL West-leading Oakland, which was idle. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Blyleven (7-4) made amends for his last start, a 6-2 loss to 
Detroit and Jack Morris on Saturday in which he gave up five runs in five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The teams -- and the pitchers -- had a rematch Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't try to figure out what I did wrong," Blyleven said. "I knew I didn't 
pitch real well (Saturday). I just came back trying to pitch my type of game." 
</P>
<P>
Through five innings Thursday, Blyleven have given up only a harmless single in 
the third to Scott Lusader, who was taken off the basepaths on Mike Heath's 
double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Morris (6-8) didn't fare so well. He had won four games in a row. Instead of a 
fifth, he made his quickest exit of the season, lasting only 2 1/3 innings 
before he was pulled. He left the field to the Anaheim Stadium tune of "Hit the 
Road, Jack." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, with two-run homers from Dave Winfield and Jack Howell, built a 4-0 
lead before the first out of the second inning. They took a 5-0 lead in the 
second when Donnie Hill doubled home Luis Polonia, who had singled and stolen 
second base. They made it 6-0 in the third on singles by Chili Davis, Devon 
White and John Orton. 
</P>
<P>
Morris had broken Blyleven's five-game winning streak Saturday. Blyleven 
returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat me and my five-game winning streak. I was the winning pitcher today," 
Blyleven said. "I guess it all evens up." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, like Blyleven before him, was not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"There's 138 excuses why I didn't pitch well tonight, and my Mom doesn't want 
to hear one of them," Morris said. "I never gave my teammates a chance. I 
(stunk?). When your location was where mine was tonight, you can expect 
earthquakes. God, I hope the sun comes up tomorrow. I think it will." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven didn't give up a second hit until Heath reached on an infield single 
in the sixth inning. He lost the shutout later in the inning with one out on a 
double by Lou Whitaker, which drove in Ed Romero who reached when a fielder's 
choice erased Heath. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven gave up a run in the seventh inning after a single to Cecil Fielder, 
who scored on a double play after moving to third on a wild pitch and a single 
by Larry Sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn replaced Blyleven in the eighth inning with a four-run lead, but it 
got interesting in the ninth when two runs scored, only the second time in the 
past 22 outings Eichhorn has allowed more than one run. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit cut the lead to two on an error by third baseman Howell, a double by 
Lloyd Moseby and a pinch-hit single to shallow right by Mark Salas. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey came on with two out and Salas on first. He balked, sending Salas 
to second, before Dave Bergman popped to left, ending the game and giving 
Harvey his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
"Eichhorn got in a little trouble," Harvey said. "That ball Salas hit wasn't 
hit hard, but it found a hole. I just hoped the last one wouldn't find a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Known for giving up homers -- Blyleven has surrendered 406, seventh most in 
major league history -- he had to face Fielder, batting .316 with 25 homers, 
best in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In his first turn against Fielder, Blyleven worked to a 2-and-2 count and then 
struck him out looking with a big slow curve. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went one for four with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader liked what he saw in Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
"He had gotten off track a little bit his last time out," Rader said. "That was 
why this was so important to him. He went out and beat the team that beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
His record has fallen to 4-7, but Mark Langston says he has felt more confident 
since making changing his delivery after walking eight in a 9-1 loss to 
Baltimore May 9. Since then, his walks have decreased and his strikeouts have 
increased dramatically. Langston has lost his past three starts by identical 
2-1 scores despite reaching double digits in strikeouts in all three. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not flustrated (sic)," said Langston, who said he declined to talk with 
reporters after a 2-1 loss to Chicago Wednesday because he was rushed and had 
nothing to say. "Granted, I'd rather have wins any day of the week," he said. 
"I'll do whatever it takes to win. I feel like I'm giving my best effort. Maybe 
that's not good enough at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
Langston said he has slowed his motion on the advice of pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann. "Lach started with the glove, and that slowed me down a lot," said 
Langston, adding that he has had problems with hurrying his delivery before. 
"It doesn't slow my arm speed. What it does is it keeps me from getting too far 
back and not letting my arm catch up to my body." 
</P>
<P>
Langston credited the changes with his success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm throwing more strikes, getting my pitches over the plate and getting ahead 
of the hitters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Greg Minton, whose recovery from elbow surgery has been slowed by a 
shoulder problem, pitched hbatting practice Thursday and will throw off the 
mound for a second consecutive day today, repeating the routine after a day off 
Saturday. The next step would be for him to pitch a simulated game or two. . . 
. Second baseman Johnny Ray (shoulder) played short toss and took batting 
practice Thursday.

MORNING BRIEFING: SHOWING HIS SUPPORT FOR THE WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Viewers of WMAQ-TV, the Chicago NBC affiliate, got a surprise Tuesday night 
when the graphic behind sports anchorman Mark Giangreco displayed a globe with 
a protective jockstrap attached. 
</P>
<P>
World Cup, get it? 
</P>
<P>
"We did have 15 or 20 calls saying it was in bad taste," Giangreco said. "A few 
of them were hard-core soccer fans." 
</P>
<P>
Giangreco said the graphic was used only once, and a mug shot of Chicago 
Sun-Times columnist Irv Kupcinet, superimposed on a globe, replaced it. 
</P>
<P>
Did Giangreco think the original graphic was in poor taste? "We were just 
having fun with it, that's all," he said. "I do that with any sport. I guess 
you have to know my style." 
</P>

Hang a right at Cairo, Ill.: In case you were planning to spend your 1991 
summer vacation at the College Football Hall of Fame in Kings Island, Ohio, 
here's a SigAlert:

It won't be there. 
</P>
<P>
They're moving it to the Great American Pyramid in Memphis, Tenn. Scheduled to 
open next June, the $200-million, 32-story complex also will house a 
20,000-seat, all-purpose arena and the American Music Awards Hall of Fame, 
among other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Check it out. According to the latest Pyramid news release, you'll also enjoy 
the Memphis Music Experience, the Egyptian Experience and a thing called the 
Pinnacle of the Pyramid/Inclinator Ride. 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget the Iowa Hawkeyes' 1939 Heisman Trophy winner, Nile Kinnick. 
</P>
<P>
Weight of the world: From Wallace Matthews of Newsday: "If the proposed George 
Foreman-Francesco Damiani fight falls apart, Foreman is prepared to take on 
Cameroon." 
</P>
<P>
A franchise in itself: The 1984 U.S. Olympic baseball team had 18 first-round 
draft choices on its 20-man roster. The 1990 update on that group is equally 
impressive. Thirteen are playing in the major leagues: Scott Bankhead, Will 
Clark, Mike Dunne, Chris Gwynn, Barry Larkin, Shane Mack, John Marzano, Oddibe 
McDowell, Mark McGwire, Cory Snyder, B.J. Surhoff, Bill Swift and Bobby Witt. 
</P>
<P>
Revised game plan: Bill McCartney, University of Colorado football coach, has a 
new book, "From Ashes to Glory," coming out in August. Recalling the Buffaloes' 
rise to national recognition in 1989, McCartney discusses his battle with 
alcoholism, his belligerence under the influence and his religious awakening. 
</P>
<P>
When a Denver alternative newspaper revealed that in April 1989, McCartney's 
daughter, Kristyn, had given birth to the son of Sal Aunese, the Colorado 
quarterback who died of cancer shortly afterward, the coach said he was angry 
enough to murder the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
But a stranger approached him one afternoon and handed him three 3-by-5 index 
cards with a verse of Scripture written on each. McCartney said he did not read 
the cards until after his wife showed his daughter the alternative paper's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back from this point in time," McCartney wrote, "I have very little 
doubt about one thing: Those three cards arrived just in time to save two 
lives. They saved mine from a possible death penalty or life sentence in 
prison. And they saved the life of the man I would surely have tried to kill."

TV-RADIO: DID NBC MAKE RILEY ITS HOST TO GIVE NBA TELECASTS A FACE LIFT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is NBC guilty of sexploitation? 
</P>
<P>
That word was being thrown around in the late 1970s, when networks were hiring 
such people as Phyllis George and Cheryl Tiegs as sports commentators. They 
were just pretty faces, the critics said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, this is the '90s, and the question now might be: Is Pat Riley merely 
another pretty face? 
</P>
<P>
NBC, realizing that the former Laker coach would be on camera more if he worked 
as a studio host, surprisingly gave him that role. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has no experience as the host of a live TV show, and it's not an easy 
job. He admitted he has a lot of mechanics to learn. Stepping into a 
commentator's role no doubt would have been easier. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has some experience as a commentator, although he told David Letterman 
Wednesday night that he mainly just said, "That's right, Chick," during his 
tenure as Chick Hearn's partner. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hearn, who should know, thinks Riley will be just fine as NBC's NBA 
host. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think he'll do a remarkable job," Hearn said Thursday. "Some things 
might be a little strange to him, but they'll give him plenty of rehearsal 
time, and with his personality and appearance, he can't miss. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've got in Riley is a two-position player, someone who could be a 
commentator or a host. 
</P>
<P>
"I will say that Riley has a tough act to follow. Pat O'Brien was the best I've 
ever seen, but that isn't to say that Pat Riley couldn't eventually be even 
better." 
</P>
<P>
One thing now clear is that Riley wasn't kidding when he once told O'Brien, 
during a halftime interview, "I want to be you. I want your job." 
</P>
<P>
Add Riley: By making him the host, NBC may have created a sticky situation. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to have two equal broadcasting teams. And Riley and Chuck Daly, as 
the commentators, would have been about as equal as possible. 
</P>
<P>
But now Daly, if he accepts NBC's offer to become a commentator, would clearly 
be No. 1 ahead of any other commentator. 
</P>
<P>
So who would get him, Bob Costas or Marv Albert? 
</P>
<P>
Last add Riley: At least all the media speculation that has been surrounding 
Riley will finally die down. 
</P>
<P>
The daily reports, the conflicting reports, sportscasters fighting over who 
scooped whom, the back-stabbing, the unnamed sources -- it all got to be a 
little ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Riley said from New York Wednesday. "Certain people in 
the media, I call them buzzards, just wouldn't let the story die. It was 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that after a meeting with Laker owner Jerry Buss in February, he 
virtually decided that he wouldn't be back as coach. He said the final decision 
was made about two weeks to 10 days before it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Buss and I decided to wait to make the announcement until a new coach 
could be hired," Riley said. "We had no idea all the fuss we would create." 
</P>
<P>
What Buss and Riley learned was, with so much competition among the media these 
days, you can't sit on a major announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball season may be over, but the sport is still on TV in a variety of 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
The finals of the Coup de Hoop three-on-three competition among amateurs, taped 
last weekend in Venice, will be on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
And Monday at 6 p.m., the One-on-One Collegiate Challenge at Trump Plaza in 
Atlantic City, N.J., will be shown on pay-per-view. The event is being carried 
by most cable systems, and the cost is $12.95. Some systems will charge $17.95 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The participants, all eligible for next Wednesday's NBA draft, are Lionel 
Simmons, Gary Payton, Chris Jackson, Bo Kimble, Travis Mays, Bimbo Coles, Sean 
Higgins and Willie Burton, a late addition. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, from Minnesota, replaces Syracuse's Derrick Coleman, who was dropped 
after organizers were unable to reach him. Coleman's advisers, however, say the 
player pulled out due to a dispute over insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will earn $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The show also includes the finals of a national vertical-dunk contest, with a 
$50,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning height will be 10 feet 9 inches, and the basket will be raised

Add one-on-one: Cynics might snicker, but Billy Packer, hired to be the color 
commentator, isn't.

"If I were an NBA scout, I would pay attention," he said. "This competition 
will show the raw skills of a player, plus what kind of competitor he is."

Packer, who will work with Maryland play-by-play announcer Johnny Holliday, 
picks Kimble to win the one-on-one competition. 
</P>
<P>
"He's strong enough to go inside, or he can hit from outside," Packer said. 
</P>
<P>
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, which has posted odds on the event, made Simmons 
the 6-5 favorite, Payton the 2-1 second choice, Jackson 3-1 and Kimble 4-1.

Recommended viewing: Coverage of last year's Escape From Alcatraz triathlon 
will be shown as a 90-minute special on NBC Sunday at noon. The GGP 
Sports-produced show is tremendous. It's far more than just a sporting event.

<P>
The host is Fred Roggin, who demonstrates his versatility. He serves as both an 
announcer of the race and as sort of a tour guide of the island, and handles 
both roles well. 
</P>
<P>
The triathlon, a Bay Area event since 1981, begins with a grueling 1 1/4-mile 
swim from the island, followed by a 16-mile bike ride and a 13-mile run.

Michael Chang lost two tiebreakers and with them his second-round match, bowing 
to Mark Kratzmann of Australia, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3), at the Manchester Open 
grass-court tournament Thursday in England. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was the third-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, the second-seeded player, beat fellow American Joey Rive, 4-6, 
6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chang did not seem unhappy. He wanted to travel the 200 miles south to London 
Saturday to complete his training for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, in the next few days I can work well before Wimbledon, because I'll 
now go down to London, where the grass is that little bit harder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang saved seven match points before Kratzmann, better known for his doubles 
play, finally served the winner.

PLO TO PROBE RAID ON ISRAEL BY GUERRILLAS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: BUT PALESTINIANS DENOUNCE THE U.S. SUSPENSION OF TALKS BECAUSE OF THE 
SPLINTER GROUP'S BEACH ATTACK.

<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization on Thursday angrily denounced the 
suspension of its 18-month-old dialogue with the United States as "a test to 
the Arabs' will of resistance," but it said it has agreed to investigate the 
guerrilla raid that led to the rupture. 
</P>
<P>
In directing an investigative committee to look at the May 30 attack on an 
Israeli beach by a PLO splinter group, the organization's leadership said it is 
"reaffirming its commitment . . . to the declaration to renounce terrorism, all 
forms of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
A PLO official said the statement from the PLO Executive Committee implies that 
the PLO, through its governing national council, is prepared to denounce the 
raid and take action against the guerrilla leader who executed it -- a member 
of the committee -- if the investigation concludes that the raid violated the 
organization's historic commitment renouncing terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the PLO in an official statement says in relation 
to the beach operation . . . that if it proves to be a breach of the resolution 
of the PNC (Palestine National Council), it's going to be denounced, and 
disciplinary actions will be taken," said the official, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
However, in its response to President Bush's announcement Wednesday that he is 
suspending the dialogue unless such denunciation and punishment occurs, the PLO 
also struck a defiant tone. It pledged to escalate the Palestinian uprising in 
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and urged international leaders 
to take a "responsible position" against the American decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO is calling for a confrontation to stand against this American 
decision," the executive committee said. "Given its heroic and long-term 
struggle, the PLO will refuse to kneel down again. The intifada, which is the 
backbone, will be heightened and intensified, as this seems to be the natural 
way of struggle against occupation, until the attainment of an independent 
Palestinian state." 
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely that the carefully worded reference to an investigation, 
already alluded to privately by PLO officials in recent weeks, would be 
sufficient to satisfy the conditions Bush set for a restoration of the 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, for example, disassociates the PLO from the failed beach raid 
but still does not, for the present, condemn it. 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO leadership has taken a very clear and responsible position vis-a-vis 
the beach operation that was used by the American Administration as an excuse 
to suspend the dialogue with the PLO, and the PLO has . . . disassociated 
itself from that operation and is not responsible, (nor did) any of its 
institutions or forces have anything to do with this operation," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the committee also confirms that the Palestine National Council, 
given that it is the highest source of authority that can investigate and the 
highest form of authority for the executive committee" will investigate the 
incident, the committee said. The statement goes on to say that "in this 
respect, the PLO reaffirmed its commitment to . . . renounce terrorism, all 
forms of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces intercepted 16 guerrillas sent by the Palestine Liberation 
Front, a hard-line faction of the PLO, stopping some in their speedboats before 
they reached shore and killing or capturing all of them. Israeli authorities 
said the attackers had targeted the U.S. Embassy and civilians in the large 
hotels near the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, announcing the suspension, cited the PLO's failure to condemn the raid 
beyond a vague statement denouncing attacks against civilians. He said the 
dialogue would not be restored until the PLO took "the necessary steps," 
including condemning the operation, disassociating the organization from it and 
beginning to take steps against front leader Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul 
Abbas, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The new communique from the Executive Committee on Thursday night criticized 
the United States for bowing to Israeli pressure to break off the dialogue 
while allegedly ignoring "atrocities" committed by the Israelis against 
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate to see that a superpower like the United States, which is 
supposed to bear international responsibility for peace and security and 
stability, is taking such a decision. The PLO is a central party to the Middle 
East conflict and thus an essential partner to the peace process," the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
"Though this incident . . . was not targeted against civilians and not even a 
single civilian was injured, we see that the double standard . . . is practiced 
by the U.S. Administration," the statement added. "This decision of President 
George Bush will really push the Israeli government and its leadership into 
continuing its program of aggression and its policies of continuous murder 
against the Palestinian people in the territories." 
</P>
<P>
In Israel on Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir applauded the U.S. 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, after the United States has reached its conclusions, we cannot but 
welcome it," he said in a radio interview. "I hope this suspension will not be 
temporary, but will determine a new chapter in the U.S. attitude toward the 
Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that Bush's apparent willingness to talk to the PLO again if it 
takes a strong stand against the failed beach raid "raises doubts that perhaps 
the United States has not reached a clear conclusion that what we are indeed 
talking about is a terrorist organization that never stopped terrorism for one 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Cairo who are close to efforts to set up peace negotiations said 
the suspension was designed not to deal the PLO out of the peace process, but 
to pressure PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat into taking tighter control of the 
occasionally wayward organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has to know that they (the PLO) are speaking with one voice, that 
they're selling one company," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
But Arab diplomats predicted that Arafat, under pressure from radicals opposed 
to the peace negotiations, would be hard-pressed to make any additional 
concessions to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is being squeezed so hard he can't give any more," said one Egyptian 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who has attempted to broker direct talks 
between Israelis and Palestinians in Cairo over the subject of elections in the 
occupied territories, issued a relatively mild expression of "regret" at the 
suspension of the U.S. dialogue, an indication, some Western diplomats 
speculated, that Arab states may not be willing to fall in line behind any PLO 
demands for radical Arab resistance. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, PLO information department spokesman Jamil Hilal had called on 
Arab states to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions against the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt sees that, regardless of various evaluations of the PLO's stance, 
certain circumstances and the increasing rigidity of Israel's position have 
resulted in the freezing of the peace efforts," the Egyptians said. They urged 
a speedy resumption of the dialogue "to maintain the interests of all the 
people of the area in progressing toward peace and stability and halting 
violence, tension and suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, one Egyptian official close to the peace negotiations expressed hope 
that Arafat would eventually move to condemn the May 30 raid. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the Palestinians should have the nerve and the guts not to be 
provoked by this," he said. "In this case, a further compromise by the PLO 
should not be considered a result of pressure, but rather a result of keeping 
the good work going."

GANG GUNFIRE IS CLAIMING GROWING TOLL OF INNOCENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four-year-old Gilbert Perez Jr. lay bleeding on the floor of a Pomona house 
Wednesday night, his mother desperately trying to cover the spot on his head 
where a bullet had hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't cry, mi hijo, don't cry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the life in her only child began to drift away, she changed her plea: 
"Cry. Please, cry!" she begged. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday morning, Gilbert was dead, another innocent bystander caught in the 
violent gang rivalries that have plagued Los Angeles County for generations. In 
Pomona alone, he was the third child gunned down so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, he was not the intended target, merely a body in the way of 
the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
From Long Beach to Watts to Pasadena, indiscriminate gunfire is turning a 
growing number of innocent people -- many of them small children -- into 
victims of geography. Although such shootings are usually intended as 
retaliations, 20% to 50% of the time someone other than a rival is hit, 
according to various law enforcement estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, which serves 2.2 million people in an area 
encompassing about three-fourths of the county, reported 31 innocent bystanders 
killed in gang-related shootings in 1989. That number was up from 30 in 1988, 
26 in 1987 and 11 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Few police departments keep records of victims' ages, but officers around the 
county say that children -- sleeping on couches, sitting in cars, riding bikes 
-- are increasingly being felled by random bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at one time there was an unwritten code that in retaliation you do not 
hit the family," said Ernest Castro, director of the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department's specialized gang supervision program. "It's my 
understanding that in some areas, this unwritten code is not being complied 
with. They're getting more bold and more violent." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons, say counselors, probation officers and detectives, include the 
emergence of a new generation of smaller cliques eager to make names for 
themselves, and the arrival of immigrant gangs without ties to the traditions 
of longtime Latino gangs. 
</P>
<P>
They also point to the lawlessness engendered by the rock-cocaine trade, the 
increased firepower of weapons being used and a general sense among many of 
these youths that the line between right and wrong has been blurred by events 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they feel they have nothing left to lose," said the Rev. Bill 
Easterling, associate pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Pomona. "They can't see 
the value in their own lives, so they can't see it in any one else's." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't see it in the life of 7-year-old Kanita Hailey, who was fatally 
shot while playing baseball in Watts last Aug. 2. They didn't see it in little 
Frank Fernandez Jr., a 4-year-old Garden Grove boy who was slain Sept. 16 as he 
headed to a drive-in movie. And they didn't see it in the 10-year-old Pasadena 
girl who was wounded by a shower of bullets from a passing car in January while 
sleeping next to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, random bullets took the life of Daniel Rodriguez, a 7-year-old 
Little Leaguer gunned down on his front porch Feb. 13. Two months later, a 
Pomona infant -- 7-month-old David John Godinez Jr. -- was critically wounded 
in the chest during a drive-by attack. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these young gangbangers seem less and less concerned about where 
their bullets go," said Pomona Police Lt. Chuck Heilman. "That's what has us so 
greatly disturbed. If there's 15 kids around, they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
There were three other kids with Gilbert Perez in the back seat of the 
1960s-model Chevrolet Caprice that pulled up to a street curb in northwest 
Pomona about 11 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's mother, a former supervisor at an auto parts plant, was next to him. 
Behind the wheel was the mother of the three other children. They had just gone 
for hamburgers at a Jack in the Box and were dropping off a friend, a 
19-year-old who is believed to be a gang member, police said. 
</P>
<P>
As they sat in the Chevrolet outside the 19-year-old's house, a compact car 
drove slowly past, its occupants eyeing them closely. It turned and came back. 
Police do not know how many people were in the suspects' car or how many were 
armed. But they said at least two handguns were used -- a .22-caliber and a 
.380-caliber -- and that from six to eight shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's mother lunged to shield her son with her body, but a bullet smashed 
through the windshield and into his head. A fragment cut his mother's hand. No 
one else, including the 19-year-old police believe was the intended target, was 
injured. His identity was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's mother, carried her son into her friend's house. He lay bleeding on 
the brown and orange carpet, his mother on her knees struggling to stop the 
flow from his small head, until an ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so sad," said the owner of the home, a 40-year-old woman who asked to 
be identified only as Senora Ramirez. "He was just a child -- her only child. 
He did nothing to deserve this." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was rushed to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, but at 5:04 a.m. 
Thursday he was pronounced dead. Police have made no arrests in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Ramirez's eldest son, the male passenger in the car, was back 
out on the streets with his homeboys, talking about revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever it was, they're going to regret it for the rest of their lives," he 
said. "There's a line. You don't go killing little kids."

SUPREME COURT STRIPS AWAY 'OPINION' AS LIBEL DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court Thursday unanimously stripped away a widely used media 
defense against libel suits, ruling that a writer or speaker may be sued for 
statements that express "opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The previous standard -- that a person could be sued only for false statements 
of fact -- has been one of the most frequently used defenses in libel cases 
since the high court first suggested the distinction more than a decade ago. 
The new standard will affect a broad range of expression, from restaurant 
criticism to statements by civic activists. 
</P>
<P>
In overturning the "opinion defense," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote: 
"The statement, 'In my opinion Jones is a liar,' can cause as much damage to 
reputation as the statement 'Jones is a liar.' " The legal distinction between 
statements of fact and statements of opinion is an "artificial dichotomy," 
Rehnquist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions that are clear statements of "rhetorical hyperbole" still will be 
outside the reach of libel law because no reasonable reader would take them 
literally, Rehnquist wrote. But the routine expression of opinion by 
columnists, commentators, cartoonists, critics, writers of letters to the 
editor and others will no longer be immune. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, although libel suits usually are thought of mostly as an issue for 
the media, the decision is likely to increase the number of suits filed against 
individuals who harshly attack prominent people in public forums, several legal 
experts suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was issued in a case that pitted a former high school wrestling 
coach against a newspaper sports columnist. The decision will reopen the case, 
which already has wound its way through the courts for 15 years without ever 
going to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The high court split, 7 to 2, over reopening the case, with Justices William J. 
Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall dissenting. All nine justices, however, 
agreed on the new set of legal rules. 
</P>
<P>
Libel-law experts, both those who defend the media and those who sue them, 
agreed that the ruling will have a major impact, increasing both the number of 
suits filed and the number that end up going to trial. Over the last several 
years, the number of libel suits has declined after reaching a peak in the 
mid-1980s. That trend is now likely to be reversed, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision will open up the door" to an increased number of suits, said 
John Walsh, a New York lawyer who has represented several prominent people in 
cases against newspapers. The decision, he said, is "an extremely important 
clarification." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster," said Jane Kirtley, of the Washington-based Reporters 
Committee for Freedom of the Press. In the past, many libel suits could be 
dismissed before they ever reached a jury. Now, "every time a book reviewer or 
a commentator or cartoonist is subjected to a lawsuit, you're going to have to 
go to trial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs will still have to prove that what was said about them was false, 
which in the case of a challenged opinion may be impossible. So, defendants may 
in the end win as many cases as before. But the fact that the cases will need 
to go to trial will greatly increase the cost of the suits, Kirtley noted. 
</P>
<P>
Because Rehnquist did not define "hyperbole" when saying it will still be 
protected, unlike other statements of opinion, Thursday's ruling is likely to 
lead to a widespread new round of litigation, several lawyers predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"They have gone from solid ground onto ice. It will take a lot of cases until 
we see how thin that ice is," said Robert D. Sack, who represented a large 
group of newspapers, magazines and broadcast companies that filed a brief 
urging the justices to uphold the opinion defense. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's case began in 1974 with a fight during a wrestling match between two 
high schools outside Cleveland, Ohio. Because of the fight, the state high 
school athletic association suspended Michael Milkovich, coach of the Maple 
Heights high school team. 
</P>
<P>
When Milkovich went to Ohio's Common Pleas Court and got his suspension 
overturned, Ted Diadiun, sports columnist for the local paper, sharply 
criticized Milkovich in a column under the headline "Maple beat the law with 
the 'big lie.' " Milkovich, the columnist wrote, had taught his students a 
lesson: "If you get in a jam, lie your way out." 
</P>
<P>
Milkovich sued, saying that the writer implied he had committed perjury before 
the Common Pleas Court. The newspaper mounted several defenses, including an 
argument that the article was an opinion column and that the statements in it 
were simply Diadiun's opinions, not assertions of fact. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting case has bounced around the courts ever since on a series of 
issues. Eventually, the Ohio Supreme Court, noting that the sports pages are 
"the traditional haven for cajoling, invective and hyperbole," decided the 
newspaper's argument was correct. A lower court then dismissed Milkovich's 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal high court disagreed. A series of decisions beginning in 1964 
has offered numerous constitutional protections to defendants in libel cases, 
Rehnquist wrote. "We are not persuaded that, in addition to these protections, 
an additional separate constitutional privilege for 'opinion' is required to 
ensure the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The sorts of statements of opinion affected by Thursday's decision generally 
come to court in three separate forms. 
</P>
<P>
First are cases like Diadiun's, in which columnists, cartoonists or other 
commentators make a statement that mixes fact and opinion. In the past, 
lawyers' usual advice "has been to pat them on the head and say, 'Don't fret 
it, you're protected.' " said P. Cameron DeVore, a Seattle attorney who 
represented Diadiun. "You can't say that any more." 
</P>
<P>
The second sort of case involves not media defendants but individuals, for 
example civic activists, who attack prominent individuals in public forums and 
are then sued. In many cases in the past, the statements involved -- "So and so 
is a shady operator," for example -- have been shielded by the opinion defense. 
</P>
<P>
Those defendants may be particularly hard hit by the court's decision because 
the prospect of a long and expensive trial may be far more difficult for them 
than for a large media company, said Bruce Sanford, a Washington, D.C., lawyer 
who represents defendants in libel cases. 
</P>
<P>
A third type of case begins when a newspaper or broadcaster quotes what such a 
civic activist has said and is then sued for having repeated the statement. In 
some states, including California, courts have ruled that the media generally 
have the right to quote such statements in a "neutral report" of the news. 
Other states have recognized no such right and hold the media liable for the 
truth of statements they quote.

More than 10,000 people died in the massive earthquake that rocked northern 
provinces early Thursday, severely damaging several cities and leveling scores 
of villages, Iran's Cabinet announced in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
But some Iranian officials put the toll even higher, at 25,000 dead and tens of 
thousands injured. Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, 
said in New York that officials at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran gave him 
those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate the number will be increased" as more bodies are uncovered, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet, after an emergency session, issued a statement saying that a "sad, 
painful and horrible tragedy has so far claimed 10,000 lives and left thousands 
of others wounded," according to a broadcast by the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency (IRNA) monitored here. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Cabinet placed all government organizations "on full alert" 
and ordered that an air bridge be established between Tehran and the affected 
areas to take out survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue missions trying to reach the disaster area by road were being delayed by 
landslides, it reported. Bad weather was said to be hindering air operations. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency added that some relief teams, including several hundred 
Revolutionary Guards, had reached the scene and were searching flattened homes 
for trapped victims while others cared for the injured. 
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures were rising from hour to hour in the two hardest-hit 
provinces, Zanjan and Gilan, which are situated northwest of Tehran in a 
mountainous, agricultural area on the Caspian Sea. More than 2.7 million people 
live there. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem now is to reach some rural areas," an official of Iran's Red 
Crescent Society told Reuters, the British news agency, in Tehran. "We know 
some of the villages have been destroyed 90% or even 100%." 
</P>
<P>
With the physical obstacles and the understandable confusion in the region, it 
was impossible to vouch for the reliability of the death tolls announced by the 
Cabinet or reported by the unnamed officials at the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency did keep broadcasting revised lists of villages, towns 
and cities worst-hit by the temblor but offered no explanation of how 
information was being collected to assemble the casualty numbers being 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said Iran has contacted the U.N. 
Disaster Relief Office. The United States has already offered assistance, as 
have Britain, France, Switzerland, the European Community and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are saddened by the damage and the loss of life," said White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who reported that President Bush has sent a message 
of condolence to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Since the United States 
and Iran have no diplomatic relations, it was delivered through the Swiss 
Embassy, which looks after U.S. interests in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
At the Geophysics Center of Tehran University, the quake was measured at 
magnitude 7.3, but the U.S. Geological Survey at Golden, Colo., put the 
intensity at 7.7. It placed the quake's center at a point in the Caspian about 
15 miles off the Iranian coast. The Geophysics Center also recorded a series of 
aftershocks, including one almost 12 hours later of magnitude 6.5. 
</P>
<P>
The main quake occurred just after midnight, sending residents in the capital, 
125 miles from its center, scrambling into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Iran Television, also monitored here, showed grim scenes of relief workers 
removing broken bodies from the rubble of shattered buildings and placing them 
on stretchers. Heavy equipment was already on the scene in some areas, clearing 
away debris. Stunned women in black chadors stood outside crumpled homes and 
public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Mountains of rubble were shown in the village of Ab-Dar, and a narrator said 
these were all that was left of apartment buildings. They appeared to have been 
shaken off their foundations, collapsing like playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
Primary roads were blocked by landslides, and a dam burst near Rasht, the Gilan 
provincial capital, where relief headquarters have been established. Much of 
the area was flooded around Rasht, which is situated on the Caspian Sea. At 
least 20 deaths were reported there, and dozens of rescue vehicles, including 
trucks carrying food supplies and ambulances, have been unable to get through. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopter pilots taking part in rescue operations told IRNA that "no point 
between Rasht and Loushan 80 miles to the south has been spared by the 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Late reports said the most severe damage occurred in Zanjan, where at least 
1,600 fatalities were recorded in more than 70 villages. About 1,000 of these 
were at Ab-Dar, where every house was destroyed, according to IRNA. In Qazvin, 
an industrial city and the largest in the province, the death toll was put at 
768. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the buildings in the towns of Manjil, Loushan, Roudbar, 
Bouin and Tarom-e Oleya were reported heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The national airline, Iran Air, flew relief supplies into the region and 
returned carrying casualties, using three U.S.-made C-130 cargo planes and a 
number of helicopters. Many of the injured were taken to hospitals in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tents and blankets were flown in, along with rice, tea, sugar, 
cheese and canned foods, IRNA said. The Red Crescent Society and hospitals 
appealed for blood, blankets and powdered milk. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that buildings swayed in Baku, 
the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, 160 miles north of the center. Tass said 
there were no casualties but some minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani declared three days of official mourning and ordered every 
agency of the state to be prepared to take part in the relief effort. Then he 
and the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite Muslim spiritual leader, flew to 
the area to supervise relief operations. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was quoted as saying that the earthquake was a "divine test." 
</P>
<P>
"The bereaved and other people," he said, "should pass this test with pride 
through their patience, endeavor, cooperation and assistance." 
</P>
<P>
IRNA said many Iranians were awake when the temblor occurred, watching the 
telecast of a World Cup soccer match in Italy. Some windows were broken in 
Tehran, and many people ran into the streets, but no major damage was reported 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The quake was Iran's most severe since September of 1978, when one measuring 
7.7 shook the eastern desert region and caused about 25,000 fatalities. Soviet 
Armenia was hit by a quake in December of 1988; it measured 6.9 and also caused 
about 25,000 deaths.

DATA SHOWS RELAPSE INTO UNSAFE SEXUAL ACTIVITY BY GAY MEN; 
</P>
<P>
AIDS: LEVELS ARE FAR LOWER THAN IN EARLY 1980S. BUT FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
PREVENTION WORRIES OFFICIALS AT CONFERENCE.

<P>
Homosexual men, whose widespread adoption of safe-sex practices came close to 
halting the transmission of the AIDS virus in their communities during the 
mid-1980s, appear to be "relapsing" into unsafe sexual activities, threatening 
a new wave of deadly infection through their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Data presented here Thursday at the international AIDS conference -- along with 
trends reported by venereal disease clinics around the country -- shows that 
the level of unsafe sex among gays, while much lower than in the early '80s, is 
climbing. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, for example, the number of gay men in one study who were 
newly infected with the human immunodeficiency virus climbed to 2.6% in 1988 
after hovering around zero in the survey group during the two previous years. 
In Chicago, the number of new HIV infections in one study group climbed to 2% 
in the year ending in June, 1989, from 1% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
While these figures are far lower than the double-digit rates of transmission 
in the early '80s, before AIDS prevention campaigns took hold, they are 
worrisome to AIDS organizations based in the gay community and to public health 
officials. This is especially true in this city, where more than 50% of the gay 
men are HIV-infected. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the overwhelming majority of gay men practice safe sex most of the 
time, "This is no time to declare victory and abandon the AIDS prevention 
field," said Pat Christian, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS 
foundation. "The problem of relapse is real and must be addressed immediately." 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term maintainance of health-motivated changes -- be it sobriety from 
alcohol, adherence to a low-calorie diet, or an exercise regime -- is often 
more difficult than the initial phase of behavioral risk reduction," said Ron 
Stall of the UC-San Francisco Center for AIDS Prevention Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Stall said that most existing safe-sex campaigns aimed at the gay community are 
outdated because they emphasize adoption of safer practices -- rather than 
their maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Stall and co-researcher Maria Ekstrand presented data from San Francisco 
showing that high-risk behavior among gays -- defined as anal intercourse 
without a condom -- declined steadily from 40.6% in 1984 to just 7.3% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While 48% of the men in their survey were at low risk throughout the survey 
period, 19% of the men "relapsed" -- that is, after adopting low-risk behavior, 
they engaged in one or more acts of unprotected intercourse during the study. A 
single act of intercourse can transmit the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Relapse was most likely to occur among young men in their 20s, blacks and 
Latinos, men in relationships and men who use drugs or alcohol during sex. All 
four groups will be targeted in new campaigns if government funding can be 
secured. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these suggestions may make some people uncomfortable," Ekstrand 
acknowledged. But, said Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American 
Foundation for AIDS Research, which announced $145,000 in new grants to help 
prevent relapse, "the only people I am afraid of offending" are the gays who 
could benefit from life-saving behavioral changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Safe sex is not a decision you make once," said Martin McCombs, a health 
educator with the Stop AIDS Project in Los Angeles. "It is a decision you have 
to make every time you have sex." The project, part of the Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center, will begin holding safe-sex maintenance workshops 
for gay men in August.

STATE SENATE OKS TAX FOR CLEANUP OF OIL SPILLS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A PER-BARREL LEVY WOULD FINANCE A $150-MILLION FUND. OIL COMPANIES 
ALSO WOULD PROVIDE A LINE OF CREDIT TO DEAL WITH SPILLS.

Warned that a catastrophic tanker spill off the California coast is an eventual 
certainty, the Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to tax oil companies 
$150 million to establish a cleanup fund. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, petroleum companies would be required to provide the state with 
"unlimited" loans to help finance the high costs of containing and mopping up 
offshore spills, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The bill sailed to the Assembly on a 34-3 vote. The Assembly already has passed 
a similar but less stringent bill of its own. 
</P>
<P>
After further negotiations between the oil industry, environmentalists and 
others, a final version of the bill likely will be written by a two-house 
conference committee and forwarded to Gov. George Deukmejian, who has a 
substantially more modest oil-spill bill pending in committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barry Keene of Benicia, Democratic floor leader and author of the Senate 
bill, cited the "alarming rate" of recent oil tanker spills, including the 
Exxon Valdez in Alaska, the American Trader off Huntington Beach and the 
Norwegian Mega Borg off the Texas coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not if we will have another major oil spill off our coast," 
Keene warned. "It is when." 
</P>
<P>
Although state, local and federal agencies have oil-spill response programs, 
Keene said his bill would provide a more comprehensive and effective plan for 
spill prevention and clean up -- along with the money to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would levy a 25-cents-a-barrel tax on oil producers, except on small 
independent oil companies that turn out fewer than 500 barrels a day. The 
revenue would create a $150-million fund for oil-spill response efforts. In 
addition, oil companies would have to provide the state "unlimited" funds 
through a line of credit to pay for damage to the environment if existing 
cleanup revenues ran dry. 
</P>
<P>
The prevention and response efforts would be coordinated by a new state office 
directed by a Department of Fish and Game official. Also, emergency response 
procedures would be developed at each oil transfer facility, and tankers would 
be subject to surprise safety inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, powerful oil lobbyists have easily and routinely killed offshore 
oil legislation that would tax the industry harder or subject it to what they 
consider unfair penalties. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last couple of years, the petroleum industry has demonstrated 
greater flexibility as public support for environmental protection has grown 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Brown, of the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League, said 
after the Senate vote that oil company negotiators have demonstrated "good 
faith" in reaching a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Before passing the bill, the Senate defeated amendments that would have 
exempted inland oil producers from paying the offshore cleanup tax. But it did 
approve an amendment to grant limited immunity from lawsuits to oil-spill 
response workers whose "simple negligence" might cause property damage.

$332-MILLION EMERGENCY BILL BLOCKED 
</P>

<P>
Assembly Republicans, balking at a series of unrelated expenditures, blocked 
passage Thursday of a bill that state officials say is needed to resume funding 
medical treatment for the poor and paying refunds to Californians who qualify 
for the renter's tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
The $332-million emergency appropriations measure was sent instead to a 
two-house conference committee, where Republicans will try to split it up so 
they can vote for programs that they want to fund and vote against payments 
that they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
The bill had been approved in the Assembly on Monday, but that action was 
rescinded after GOP lawmakers complained that they hadn't realized what they 
were voting on. 
</P>
<P>
When they got another crack at the bill Thursday, the Republicans peeled off, 
with many voting against the measure and some not voting at all. Various 
members complained about a $16.3-million appropriation for abortions performed 
under the Medi-Cal program, $12.8 million to support malathion spraying against 
the Mediterranean fruit fly, and $798,000 to implement the state's ban on 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The final vote was 48 to 17, with 54 votes needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Until the bill is passed and signed by Gov. George Deukmejian, refunds to about 
150,000 taxpayers who qualify for the state renters credit will not be mailed, 
said Jim Reber, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board. Reber said the fund 
set aside for those refunds has been depleted and the checks cannot be sent 
until the Legislature allocates another $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the bill isn't passed by the time the fiscal year ends June 30, the checks 
will be funded out of the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Those returns have been processed and the money will be refunded as soon as 
the appropriation is made to the renters credit fund," Reber said. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in passing the emergency funding bill also jeopardizes about $95 
million in payments to hospitals and nursing homes serving patients in the 
state's $7.5-billion Medi-Cal program. Doctors treating Medi-Cal patients have 
already seen their payments halted for the rest of the fiscal year because the 
program has run out of money. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were these developments during a two-house conference 
committee seeking accord on a $56-billion budget for 1990-91: 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration disclosed that the temporary quarter-cent sales 
tax increase enacted last year in response to the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake 
will come up $200 million short of reconstruction and relief needs. Before it 
expires Dec. 31, the tax is expected to raise about $800 million for temporary 
housing, repair to public buildings and loans to small businesses, as well as 
other earthquake-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
Partisan fighting erupted as an Orange County flood-control project became the 
first sizable budget reduction. Led by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara), Democrats on the committee voted to eliminate $32.9 million put into 
the budget by Deukmejian to finance the first phase of Orange County's proposed 
Santa Ana River flood-control project. Vasconcellos said the money could be 
restored for the project with a bond, which would have to be approved by state 
voters. Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) was livid. He argued that using bond 
money would create budget problems down the line. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a family who is in over its head with money troubles but goes out 
for one more consolidated loan so it can maintain its standard of living," he 
said.

COURT HOLDS MAN LIABLE FOR SEXUAL DISEASE 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to overturn a milestone $150,000 
damage award against a Sonoma County man for negligently infecting his 
girlfriend with a sexual disease. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, the justices rejected a challenge to a state Court of Appeal 
ruling last March holding that persons who knowingly fail to warn their sexual 
partners they had such a disease may be held liable, even if they believe they 
are not contagious. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case said that although previous rulings had opened the way for 
suits over the negligent transmission of a sexual disease, they believe this is 
the first actual verdict of its kind to be upheld in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This sends a strong message that people who have communicable venereal 
diseases have to be careful and do the right thing when it comes to warning 
their sexual partners," said Tad S. Shapiro of Santa Rosa, attorney for a woman 
who sued a supermarket co-worker for giving her genital herpes. 
</P>
<P>
The high court refused to hear contentions from attorneys for the male 
defendant in the case that the verdict should be set aside because he was 
unaware he could transmit the disease because he was suffering no symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The man also argued that it was a violation of the constitutional right to 
privacy to be forced in a lawsuit to divulge the details of a sexual 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro called the implications of the ruling "far-reaching" and said it could 
be applied in cases involving such diseases as AIDS. But, he cautioned, because 
it can take several years for AIDS to emerge, it would be difficult to prove 
how a person was infected. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot L. Bien of San Francisco, attorney for the man in the case, said he 
would consider an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. "We feel it's very unfair 
to impose this kind of liability where a patient doesn't know when a disease is 
communicable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1985 after a woman identified in court documents only as Jane 
Doe contracted herpes, suffering a 102-degree fever, swollen glands and painful 
genital lesions. She brought suit against a man identified as Richard Roe, 
claiming he had given her the disease while failing to disclose he previously 
had suffered from three outbreaks of herpes between 1978 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Roe argued that he believed he could not transmit herpes as long as he was 
symptom-free, and that he thus had no duty to warn Doe. A Sonoma County trial 
court disagreed, finding that Roe was negligent in not disclosing the ailment 
or taking the precaution of using a condom. The court held Roe liable for 
$150,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
An appeals court in San Francisco affirmed the award, saying Roe had shown 
"total indifference" to the danger of infecting Doe and had "elected to gamble 
with her health rather than inform her of his condition or educate himself 
about the disease." 
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond question that our state's policy of preventing the spread of 
venereal disease is great and that the burden of warning a prospective sex 
partner is small," Appellate Justice Jerome A. Smith wrote for a unanimous 
three-member panel.

UPDATE / THE 'SUPERGUN' MYSTERY;

402-TON 'BARREL,' A SLAIN EXPERT, MORE INTRIGUE

Is it a gun? Is it a missile launcher? Is it oil refinery piping? 
</P>
<P>
The case of the mysterious "Iraqi supergun" continues to intrigue arms experts 
and officials in several countries. 
</P>
<P>
It involves the reputed assembly from components from various nations of the 
world's longest-range cannon, constituting a possible nuclear or chemical 
threat to Israel and involving tips from intelligence agencies and the murder 
in Brussels of a leading artillery specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The issue also surfaced at a recent Arab summit meeting in Baghdad, where 
President Saddam Hussein again denied that his country had contracted for a 
supergun to threaten Iran or Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But in London, British customs officials say they are sure they have 
confiscated parts of a supergun, the Defense Ministry maintains an official 
silence and the manufacturers argue that the seized material is piping for use 
at a petrochemical plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubts that the material violates the arms export laws," a customs 
official maintains. "Whatever it is, it isn't piping." 
</P>
<P>
The supergun story came to light April 10, when British Customs and Excise 
officers at Teesport, in northeast England, impounded eight steel tubes 
manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters for export to Iraq for a "petrochemical 
project." 
</P>
<P>
The company had been granted export permission for pipe sections, each about 18 
feet long and 39 inches in diameter. Company officials later said the impounded 
shipment was the last part of two 26-section orders of the finely bored pipe 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield Forgemasters' first reaction to the supergun charges was incredulity. 
As company official Tony Peck put it: "The allegations are utterly ridiculous. 
The 26 sections together weigh 402 tons. Try to imagine the support you would 
need for a 156-meter gun barrel weighing that much." 
</P>
<P>
At first some defense specialists agreed, suggesting that flanged sections of 
piping could not fire a projectile without blowing up or collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
But the customs officials stood their ground and now say they were tipped off 
by intelligence agents that the piping was indeed designed to be bolted 
together to form a long-range gun barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The resultant flap recalled the murder in Brussels on March 22 of ballistics 
scientist Dr. Gerald V. Bull, who was shot five times with a silencer in the 
apartment building where he lived under an assumed name. 
</P>
<P>
Bull, 62, was Canadian-born but a naturalized American, a specialist in 
long-range artillery who worked for the Canadian and U.S. governments in the 
early 1960s in joint projects. He maintained that artillery could be made to 
shoot shells at extreme range -- or satellites into space -- more cheaply than 
rockets could. 
</P>
<P>
In one project, Bull put together 16-inch-diameter U.S. naval guns from World 
War II to build three guns; one, with a 119-foot barrel, set an-altitude 
record, firing a projectile 112 miles into space. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Bull asserted that he could design a gun capable of firing a shell 
from Canada to Mexico. But the two nations preferred to develop rocket-missile 
technology, and his project was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Next, working in a Vermont factory, Bull designed a long-range, self-propelled 
155-millimeter gun, which he sold to South Africa through shadow companies in 
Spain and Antigua. It reportedly outperformed the best Soviet guns in the 
Angola war. 
</P>
<P>
Bull's plant was raided by the FBI, and he was convicted of violating U.S. arms 
embargo laws and sentenced to six months in jail in 1980. Released and 
embittered, he moved to Brussels, where in 1983 he set up his Space Research 
Corp., an arms-dealing firm. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Bull had published a book in which he detailed how an artillery weapon 
could be made from sections of steel pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Bull's company supplied artillery pieces to Iraq in the Persian Gulf War -- 
and, arms experts suggest, quite possibly to Iraq's rival Iran as well. Later, 
Bull received contracts from Iraq for the development of a long-range artillery 
system, according to his son, Michael. Bull's company farmed out the orders to 
small European suppliers -- always officially listed as equipment for oil 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
After the British crackdown, similar equipment has been intercepted in West 
Germany, Italy, Greece and Turkey. Baghdad called the seizures a "big lie" 
orchestrated by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
As events unfolded, Sheffield Forgemasters acknowledged that Bull's company 
acted as "middleman" for the piping order. Meanwhile, in Brussels, Bull's sons 
announced the dissolution of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
So, the mystery of the supergun remains.

TESTY GORBACHEV INSISTS PARTY DID OK REFORMS;

<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE PRESIDENT IS STUNG BY ACCUSATIONS THAT HE ABANDONED 
SOCIALISM.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, stung by conservative criticism of his 
leadership, Thursday denounced as slander allegations that he failed to obtain 
Communist Party approval of sweeping reforms intended to establish a market 
economy in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"To consider that this idea and program dropped from the sky, or that somebody 
is undertaking an overnight coup d'etat to change our course, that is slander," 
Gorbachev told delegates to a party conference. "Don't be suspicious that 
something is being done secretly to turn the rails and move the country in the 
direction of capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
His critics are trying "to impose things on us that are a contradiction of the 
truth," said Gorbachev, angry and grim after more than two days of unremitting 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"These attempts are rotten and improper and made by people who seek a 
completely different goal from ours -- that is to find new forms of life and 
make the lives of people better." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was replying to a well-known political economist, Alexei Sergeyev, 
who had asked delegates to delete the formation of a "regulated market economy" 
from a statement of party goals on grounds that the party had never discussed 
or approved the program. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev's remarks were clearly aimed at Yegor K. Ligachev, the 
conservative standard-bearer within the party's Politburo. Ligachev had accused 
him Wednesday of abandoning the principle of collective leadership and of not 
discussing the economic reforms and other major issues, including developments 
in Eastern Europe and German reunification, with the rest of the 12-man 
Politburo and the policy-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Although he never cited Gorbachev by name, Ligachev's charges compounded the 
outpouring of criticism from conservatives, who accused the president of 
abandoning the ideals of socialism, of introducing capitalism into the Soviet 
economy, of destroying the party, of weakening the country internationally and 
of letting the country slide into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Ligachev's accusation was to confirm all the other criticism and 
then imply that Gorbachev was doubly to blame for having forsaken his party 
principles for power and ruling alone. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev replied that he was familiar with the contention that the decisions 
on economic reform are "irregular," since the program introduced by the 
government had not been formally discussed and approved by the Central 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the concepts behind the reforms had been discussed at a succession 
of party meetings and public forums and that the Central Committee had 
repeatedly endorsed the fundamental ideas contained in them, if not the full 
program. 
</P>
<P>
His critics had either failed to read those decisions or did not want to accept 
them and the course the party had chosen, and they were trying to lead the 
party back, Gorbachev continued, jabbing the desk with his finger for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
The audience of 2,700 delegates to the founding congress of the Russian 
Communist Party applauded Gorbachev only briefly, but they voted overwhelmingly 
to reject Sergeyev's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The next test of his authority will come today when the conference elects a 
first secretary for the new Russian party. Seven men have been nominated, and 
several of them criticized Gorbachev, the present leadership and recent policy 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev still faces a fight, however, if he continues to combine the two 
posts of president and Soviet party general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic and increasingly a 
Gorbachev rival, Thursday added his voice to those calling on him to give up 
his party post. 
</P>
<P>
"I have advised him that it is better for him to sit in one chair rather than 
two," Yeltsin told journalists. "Let the party be headed by another person." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that, from his discussions with Gorbachev recently, he believes 
that the president is seriously considering giving up the post of general 
secretary when the party leadership is reorganized next month at a party 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the party be headed by another person," Yeltsin said. "There are enough 
talents in the country with 280 million people to find a replacement for him." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that he is not seeking and would not accept the leadership of the 
new Russian party because of the heavy workload he already carries as the 
president of the republic, the Soviet Union's largest. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 20 hours a day of work," Yeltsin said, "and I think that Gorbachev in 
his capacity as president has no less." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ligachev had suggested that Gorbachev should give up his post as 
party general secretary. "One cannot head the party, this leading force, 
without dedicating all one's time to it," Ligachev said. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives' complaint goes beyond the issue of whether Gorbachev has 
sufficient energy and time to run both the state and the party. As Ligachev and 
others made clear, they see far too much of the power the party formerly 
exercised now being shifted to the government and concentrated in Gorbachev's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his argument that he had a firm mandate for the shift to a market 
economy, Gorbachev left unanswered Ligachev's criticism that the specific 
program put forward by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was not discussed in 
the Politburo or Central Committee, although it is aimed at a fundamental 
transformation of the country and aroused great concern because of the 
hardships involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that at Central Committee meetings there have been some statements, 
some comments and some discussion, including remarks by Mikhail Gorbachev, but 
the social consequences of the economic program were not understood nor were 
the ideological aspects given due attention," Leningrad party leader Boris 
Gidaspov commented. 
</P>
<P>
"Questions of principle that relate to the profound interests of society should 
be dealt with at party conferences before the president makes a decision." 
</P>
<P>
But Gidaspov, whose influence extends far beyond Leningrad, said he hopes that 
Gorbachev will remain as general secretary but urged him to recruit a team of 
younger people to spread the workload. 
</P>
<P>
That Gorbachev can make decisions on economic reform and other major issues may 
mean, in fact, that he will give up at least day-to-day management of the party 
as its general secretary and exercise power as president and perhaps party 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, replying to his critics, indicated on Wednesday that his period as 
party chief might end soon. Under the Soviet constitution, he would remain 
president for the rest of his five-year term and could run for reelection.

CEAUSESCU'S BROTHER GETS 15-YEAR PRISON TERM

The brother of executed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was sentenced to 15 
years in prison Thursday for inciting genocide and attempted murder during the 
December revolution, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A military court in Bucharest handed down the sentence on Nicolae Andruta 
Ceausescu, 66, making him the first member of his family to be punished in the 
courts since the Stalinist dictator was shot on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
The former general and head of secret police training, was convicted after a 
three-month trial and has 10 days to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of killing several demonstrators and ordering his men to shoot 
at crowds during the uprising that ousted his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Adrian Nitoiu, pointing out that the dictator's brother could have been 
jailed for life, said, "The court verdict was an act of justice and not 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
The former general, who bears a remarkable resemblance to his older brother, 
told the court: "I am the traitor's brother, but I am not guilty of the charges 
brought against me." 
</P>
<P>
Romania abolished the death penalty soon after the dictator's execution. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bucharest university students began a three-day strike Thursday to 
protest arrests and violence during anti-government demonstrations last week 
while a subdued capital prepared to mark Ceausescu's fall six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Students' league spokesman Radu Manolescu said more than 2,000 students were 
boycotting studies. 
</P>
<P>
At his side, a sobbing Letitia Plokay said she feared for the life of her 
husband Stefan, a 26-year-old philology student, whom she had not seen since he 
was dragged away by the miners who crushed last week's demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"The police say he was taken away yesterday, but they could not say where," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Manolescu said the strikers were particularly concerned to have Marian Munteanu 
freed from custody because he was a symbol of the peaceful protest movement. 
</P>
<P>
Munteanu, who was injured during last week's violence, was arrested in a 
hospital Monday on charges of inciting and committing violence and was taken to 
a prison hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The students' strike action, while largely symbolic, struck a jarring note 
between Wednesday's inauguration of President Ion Iliescu and ceremonies today 
to mark Ceausescu's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu promised in his inaugural speech Wednesday to keep Romania on the path 
of democracy, but Western diplomats and opposition leaders said deeds are 
needed now to prove he meant what he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States boycotted the inauguration and the European Community 
deferred the signing of a trade and cooperation agreement with Romania to 
protest Iliescu's role in last week's violence. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Alan Green met Foreign Minister Sergiu Celac Thursday for what 
Green later called a frank discussion.

MULRONEY ENTREATS NEWFOUNDLAND TO RATIFY CONSTITUTIONAL PACT;

<P>
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made an unusual appearance Thursday in this 
fog-shrouded port city to urge provincial legislators to join him in his battle 
to amend the constitution and blunt French-Canadian separatism. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you simply to do for Canada what you would do for your family, by 
healing the divisions (and) binding the wounds," Mulroney said. 
</P>
<P>
Newfoundland's legislature has an opportunity to make or break Mulroney's 
unifying vision: The House of Assembly is scheduled to vote this morning on 
whether to ratify a package of constitutional amendments that would give more 
powers to Quebec. Feelings of separatism are on the rise in Quebec these days, 
and if Newfoundland's legislators vote against the amendments, Quebecers are 
likely to take it as evidence that English Canadians can't accept or understand 
them. A slow process of separation might then be set in motion. 
</P>
<P>
The Newfoundland vote is expected to be a squeaker; no clear pattern has 
emerged, and a number of legislators were saying even one day before the vote 
that they hadn't made up their minds what to do. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of persuading them to ratify the amendments, Mulroney played up the 
fears of Quebec "nationalism" in his speech, describing Quebec separatist 
leader Jacques Parizeau as a wolf at the nation's door. Parizeau doesn't hold 
any government office, but he leads the main opposition party in Quebec, the 
Parti Quebecois. If the current government in Quebec were voted out of office, 
the Parti Quebecois would be the only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who seek to replace us (political leaders) love Canada as much as 
we do," Mulroney told the Newfoundland politicians, "with one exception, and 
the exception is Mr. Parizeau in the province of Quebec." 
</P>
<P>
He reminded Newfoundland's legislators that the Parti Quebecois has been 
gaining ground in the opinion polls over the past few weeks and said that if 
Parizeau were to win some future election, he would definitely call a 
referendum on whether Quebec should separate. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to be cute," warned Mulroney. "He's going to put the question 
straight out. 'Do you want to separate? Yea or nay?' " 
</P>
<P>
Quebec already had one such referendum 10 years ago, during a previous Parti 
Quebecois government, and Mulroney reminisced about that agonizing experience. 
About 60% of the total population voted to stick with Canada, but Mulroney 
pointed out that if the Francophone vote alone were considered, the vote was a 
mere 50-50 to stay within Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't an experience that I either enjoyed or that I propose to repeat, if 
it can be avoided," said the prime minister, who himself is an Anglophone 
Quebecer. "The Meech Lake Accord is designed to avoid any future referendum." 
</P>
<P>
"The Meech Lake Accord" is a name Canadians give Mulroney's package of 
constitutional amendments, since they were drafted at a secluded conference 
center on the shores of Meech Lake in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney also went to great lengths to assure Newfoundland's House of Assembly 
that the Meech Lake Accord is not a radical document. He claimed that its five 
central elements have all been discussed for decades and that the powers it 
would give Quebec have all been offered to the French-speaking province on 
other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardly revolutionary," he said. "It's in the tradition of over 30 years 
of constitutional discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney acknowledged that his own standing in the opinion polls is disastrous 
and said that a great deal of the opposition to the accord was really misplaced 
public anger that ought to be directed at himself and his economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Newfoundland legislators, who have been increasingly anguished over how to vote 
in the past few days, seemed impressed with Mulroney's remarks. They gave him a 
standing ovation when he finished his speech, an unusual response from 
politicians in a province deeply resentful of powerful Quebec and of federal 
politicians in general. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the legislators here seem open-minded to any face-saving reason to vote 
in favor of the Meech Lake Accord. While their constituents have been telling 
them again and again to vote it down, many of the legislators have seemed 
genuinely fearful about doing something that might wreck prosperous, peaceful 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney's pitch to Newfoundland may be futile, however, if nothing can be done 
to arrest runaway opposition to the accord in another Canadian province, 
Manitoba, the only other province that hasn't ratified the accord. 
</P>
<P>
In Manitoba, the lone Indian member of the provincial legislature, Elijah 
Harper, has mounted a successful procedural battle to delay all debate of the 
constitutional amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians have assumed all along that the Meech Lake Accord will die if it 
isn't ratified by all 10 provinces by this Saturday. Some lawyers argue, 
however, that a careful reading of the accord shows that legally, there really 
is no such deadline. Mulroney is apparently hoping that if Newfoundland does 
vote to ratify the accord, Quebec will accept a rollback of the deadline for 
Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
In Winnipeg, Manitoba's capital, about 4,000 Indians, some wearing traditional 
headdress and others pounding ceremonial drums, gathered outside the 
legislature to celebrate their procedural victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians argue that while the accord treats French-speaking Quebec as a 
distinct society, it makes no allowances for their own distinctness.

SENATE SUSTAINS BUSH VETO OF BILL TO RELAX HATCH ACT; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: THE MOVE TO EXPAND FEDERAL WORKERS' POLITICAL ACTIVITY RIGHTS 
FALLS 2 VOTES SHORT. THE PRESIDENT HAS YET TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY CONGRESS.

<P>
President Bush preserved his perfect veto record when the Senate Thursday 
sustained his rejection of a bill that would have permitted 3 million federal 
employees to participate in partisan political activity during off-duty hours. 
</P>
<P>
Senators seeking to override Bush's veto fell two votes short of the required 
two-thirds majority. Three Republicans who had voted for the bill a month ago 
switched sides to support the White House position. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Bush has prevailed on 12 of 12 veto confrontations with 
Congress. On five occasions, neither the House nor Senate was able to override. 
In three cases in which the House achieved the two-thirds majority needed to 
override, pro-Bush forces in the Senate were able to sustain his veto. On four 
vetoes, there was no attempt to override, and the legislation was rewritten to 
meet Bush's objections. 
</P>
<P>
All 55 Democratic senators and 10 Republicans voted Thursday to override the 
veto of legislation intended to modify the Hatch Act. 
</P>
<P>
Bush objected that the bill would have "politicized" the civil service. 
Proponents of the bill -- strongly backed by federal employee unions, which 
traditionally give most of their support to Democrats -- said it would simply 
provide U.S. government workers with the same basic rights that all other 
citizens enjoy, without injecting politics into official business. 
</P>
<P>
Three GOP lawmakers -- Sens. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Trent Lott of 
Mississippi and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico -- voted to sustain the 
President's veto, although all three supported the legislation when it was 
passed by the Senate on May 10. 
</P>
<P>
Domenici said after the vote that he objected to a provision that would have 
allowed government workers to solicit contributions from fellow employees for 
federal union political action committees, and he complained about the Senate's 
refusal to exempt the FBI, CIA and similar agencies from the bill's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato and Lott did not explain why they switched positions on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers, 
accused Bush of "strong-arm tactics to force senators to abandon their 
consciences and switch their votes to continue to deny millions of Americans 
political freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Sombrotto said that postal and federal employees would try again to persuade 
Congress to support new legislation to relax provisions of the 51-year-old law 
that blocks U.S. workers from taking part in partisan politics on their own 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We will win -- if not in 1990, then in 1991, or 1992 or 1993, or whenever," he 
said in a statement. "We will fight for as long as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
California's senators split along party lines. Republican Pete Wilson, who had 
missed the vote on the legislation last month, voted to sustain the veto. 
Democrat Alan Cranston voted to override. 
</P>
<P>
GOP backers of Bush's veto said that the bill would have benefited Democrats 
more than Republicans. "The federal work force has been partisan Democratic," 
Senate Minority Whip Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) said. "A political game is 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), who led the unsuccessful override attempt, said 
that it was "a matter of simple fairness" to allow government employees to take 
part in election campaigns as their neighbors do.

AVIANCA PILOT DISPUTES NEED TO USE SPECIFIC EMERGENCY TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MELVILLE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cockpit crew's failure to use "standard phraseology" to report a critical 
fuel shortage was defended by an Avianca Airlines flight captain as hearings 
continued here Thursday on the January crash of an Avianca jetliner that ran 
out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers had testified earlier that, because Mauricio Klotz, 
co-pilot of the Boeing 707, used non-standard terms such "need priority" and 
"running out of fuel," they failed to recognize the gravity of the situation 
and did not give the plane immediate clearance to land at New York's John F. 
Kennedy Airport after numerous delays on its long flight from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised that 'priority' and 'running out of fuel' meant nothing 
to them," Avianca Capt. Saul Pertuz, a Colombian citizen, told a National 
Transportation Safety Board panel on Thursday. "I am terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to an Avianca route manual used in the training of the airline's 
pilots, Pertuz said there is nothing in it "that says we must use specific 
words . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"In my country and in this country, there have been a great number of 
(emergency situations) in which the pilot would not use the word 'emergen" 
Pertuz said. "He would just tell them what happened." 
</P>
<P>
However, Klotz's copy of the route manual, recovered from the wreckage of 
Flight 52, shows that Avianca's pilots have been trained to "declare an 
emergency . . . and report fuel remaining . . . if the remaining usable fuel 
supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safer landing." 
</P>
<P>
The crew of Flight 52 did neither in the minutes before the big jet ran out of 
fuel and slammed into a wooded hillside in nearby Cove Neck, Long Island, 
killing 73 of the 158 aboard. Pilot Laureano Caviedes, co-pilot Klotz and the 
flight engineer, Matias Moyano, were among those who died. 
</P>
<P>
Recordings recovered from the cockpit show that the failure to declare an 
emergency may have stemmed from a misunderstanding between the pilot and 
co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Two languages were being spoken -- English in the conversations with the 
controllers, Spanish in the conversations between the pilot and co-pilot. In 
addition, Caviedes had commented earlier that he was having trouble hearing 
what Klotz was saying. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial attempt to land at Kennedy was aborted when the plane sank 
below the safe glide path in heavy, gusty winds, Klotz radioed controllers, 
"We're running out of fuel . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Caviedes instantly told his co-pilot: "Tell him we're in emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen seconds later, the captain repeated his order: "Advise him we are in an 
emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Four seconds after that, the captain asked Klotz, "Did you tell him?" 
</P>
<P>
Although he had made no mention of an "emergency," Klotz replied, "Yes, sir, I 
already advised him." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 seconds later, Klotz again radioed controllers that "we're running out 
of fuel." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you already advise him that we don't have fuel?" the pilot asked Klotz. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," the co-pilot replied. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in one of the responses that remains a mystery, Klotz told controllers 
who asked him if his fuel was adequate for the new approach route they had 
recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess so. Thank you very much." About 7 minutes later, its engines starved 
of fuel, the plane crashed.

FRED B. HUESMAN, FORMER OWNER OF DESMOND'S, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred B. Huesman, former owner of the now defunct Desmond's clothing store chain 
which was founded near Los Angeles' historic Olvera Street in 1862, has died. 
He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Huesman died Wednesday during open heart surgery at St. Vincent's Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Glendale, Huesman joined Desmond's five years after his uncle, 
Ralph R. Huesman, purchased it from Desmond family heirs in 1921. He succeeded 
his uncle as president in 1944 and continued in that position until 1973, when 
he took the title of chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Huesman retired in 1978, and the chain, which had become a part of the New 
York-based Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., went out of business in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the chain had 19 stores throughout Southern California. It began 
as a hat shop founded by Daniel Desmond and grew into a major apparel retailer 
selling men's, women's and boys' specialty clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the chain's centennial, Huesman streamlined Desmond's 
merchandising, redesigning the stores to make items traditionally stored in 
glass showcases more accessible to customers. Retailers, he said, had an 
obligation to make shopping pleasant as well as to supply merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Huesman is survived by two daughters, Joan Madden and Marianne Huesman, and one 
son, Ralph F. Huesman, and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Father John E. Huesman, will say the funeral Mass at 7 p.m. Sunday 
in Christ the King Church, 624 N. Rossmore Ave. Interment will be at 11 a.m. 
Monday in Calvary Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Fred B. 
Huesman Scholarship Fund at Loyola High School, from which Huesman was 
graduated. Contributions can be addressed to the president's office at the 
school, 1901 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles 90006.

DEUKMEJIAN ASSAILS PAROCHIALISM IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian Thursday sharply criticized opposition in Los Angeles to 
the local placement of state prisons and waste-to-energy projects that he 
termed part of a destructive phenomenon in state politics he called NIMBY, 
defined as a parochial "not in my back yard" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a luncheon of San Fernando Valley business people, the governor 
also declared that adding "another layer of stringent environmental controls on 
top of the effective regulations that we already have" could result in many 
businesses leaving California, throwing state residents out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
This appeared to be an allusion to the "Big Green" environmental initiative 
sponsored for the November ballot by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people paid $40 each to attend the luncheon at the Sheraton 
Universal to hear what had been billed as a major statement by Deukmejian. Some 
expressed disappointment afterward that the governor had enunciated only 
familiar conservative themes. 
</P>
<P>
NIMBY attitudes, said Deukmejian, are "with increasing frequency hampering 
problem-solving, policy-making and the completion of public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Los Angeles County now exports all of its 36,000 convicted felons 
to our state prisons, there is not one single state prison in this county," 
Deukmejian said. In the eight years since the Legislature mandated that one be 
constructed, the process of doing so has been mired in studies, environmental 
impact reports and now, lawsuits, he complained. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the costs to the taxpayers for these delays mount and our prison 
overcrowding gets worse," he said. "I believe it is totally irresponsible for 
anyone to continue to throw up roadblocks in the way of a policy that has 
already been fully debated for years and decided." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the governor said he is unsympathetic with Los Angeles opposition to 
waste-to-energy projects. "Of the nine waste-to-energy projects that were under 
consideration in Los Angeles County," he said, "seven have now been abandoned 
due to local opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Selfishness is also seen, the governor said, in opposition to oil drilling and 
Malathion spraying to destroy the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though our state uses twice as much gas as we produce, many Californians 
don't even want to consider aiding the production of additional energy supplies 
by supporting environmentally sound offshore oil development projects," 
Deukmejian declared. 
</P>
<P>
He complained: "Most Californians want to enjoy a wide variety of wholesome 
food, fruits and vegetables at reasonable prices. But many Californians refused 
to support the necessary steps we had to take to protect that food supply from 
the Medfly infestation."

UNDERCOUNTING THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to "Huge Undercount of Homeless Charged," Metro, June 9: 
</P>
<P>
The blame for the undercount in the 1990 federal census of the homeless cannot 
be put on the enumerators, crew leaders or trainers. The blame is to be put on 
those higher up who were responsible for establishing and implementing the 
enumerator training session procedures. They should have trained the trainers a 
lot better. 
</P>
<P>
The night of the homeless count (March 20) was mass confusion from minute one. 
On training night, several of us found we had been told different things such 
as work hours and pay rate; some were told they'd have police escort; in 
general, there a lot of inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
The trainers were poorly prepared and poorly selected. I don't believe they had 
a full understanding of the homeless. They greatly emphasized how dangerous the 
night could be rather than concentrating on training us on how to take the best 
possible count. But then again, they were only passing on what their 
supervisors had told them to say. 
</P>
<P>
They really scared the enumerators unnecessarily. The count turned out to be a 
lot less scary than they painted it. They had us believing that the homeless we 
might encounter were all dangerously violent, mentally ill, unapproachable 
people. To an extent this may be true but they should have emphasized the use 
of caution and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
It is no small wonder that the enumerators were reluctant to go into parks, 
down alleys or walk the streets. 
</P>
<P>
All the negative publicity about the supposed failure of that night makes me 
angry because our team of four enumerators really put forth an extra effort to 
find and talk with the homeless despite the alarmist tactics used by the 
trainers. 
</P>
<P>
I wish someone from the media had talked to us instead of making general 
negative comments about all the enumerating teams. Our team looked under 
bushes, in parked cars, freight yards, boxcars, through dark parks, and really 
thought about where a homeless person might bed down. The homeless we 
encountered were friendly and helpful, telling us where we might find other 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
If the count was inaccurate, the homeless were also to blame a little bit. On 
more than one occasion, we found evidence of someone having just been in the 
area (bedding, shopping cart with possessions, food cans) and maybe hiding 
nearby until we left. This was frustrating knowing someone was near and we 
couldn't count them. 
</P>
<P>
I'm quite proud of our team. We worked great together. The ex-New York taxi 
driver was the designated driver, the computer technician was the navigator, 
the two personnel representatives served as secretary and interviewer. We can 
be proud of our accomplishments. We had fun.

The people of Los Angeles are to be complimented for their achievements in 
homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
I am homeless and the day that I arrived in Los Angeles, I received a room, 
food stamps and an opportunity to reciprocate for this assistance through 
workfare. While imperfect, I am impressed by the city's innovations and 
encourage others to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, keep up the good work!

TELLTALE WHITE MALE PAW PRINTS; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: MEDICAL STUDIES THAT ARE VALID FOR ONLY HALF OF THE POPULATION ARE NO 
BARGAIN. 
</P>

<P>
This is a story that begins with white male rats. No, it is not a political 
fantasy created by those who regard "white male rats" as redundant. The subject 
here is science and sex. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that most of the basic research that teaches us what is good and 
bad for human beings begins with rodents of the male persuasion. Their female 
counterparts are usually excluded because of what might be called "raging 
hormonal imbalance." Their female physiology is more complex. In research, 
female humans are also excluded from most studies. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't come across this information through personal experience. I have never 
seen a rodent with PMS. The tale of the white male rat was told at hearings of 
the House subcommittee on health and the environment. It turns out that the 
exclusion of women as subjects for research is only one piece of a profoundly 
skewed research program. Not only are men studied more, so are their health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
About 13% of the National Institute of Health's $5.7-billion budget goes to 
study the health risks of the half of the population that is female. While 
every woman in America will go through menopause, hormone treatment has little 
priority in terms of federal dollars. While every woman ages, the latest study, 
"Normal Human Aging," has no data about women at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a theory that you fund what you fear," says Rep. Patricia Schroeder, 
who along with Reps. Olympia Snowe of Maine and Henry Waxman of California has 
kept a spotlight on this issue. "When you have a male-dominated group of 
researchers, they are more worried about prostate cancer than breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
But the rise of women in medical and policy-making positions in the rest of the 
world has put such issues in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, medical science is not all that different from any other business 
in America that is just beginning to adjust to women. There is the dual notion 
that you can either treat women just like men or exclude them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
In line with the rat theory, many researchers lament that including women, with 
all their peculiar plumbing, is too complicated and too expensive. But in the 
long run, research that is valid for only half of the human species is no 
bargain. So the next time you pop a pill or follow the doctor's orders, check 
carefully for the telltale paw prints of white male rats.

ART: LACMA'S 'TREASURES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM,' TAKEN FROM THE MUSEUM AT 
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, ILLUSTRATES THE MARCH OF ART THROUGH THE CENTURIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Delacroix, Degas -- given the list of 
stellar names from the pantheon in Western art history, it might seem odd to 
choose Francois-Xavier Fabre as the artist to represent the highly engaging 
exhibition, "Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum: The Increase of Learning 
and other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
But that's just what its organizers did. Through the reproduction of a Fabre 
portrait on the covers of both the catalogue and the press kit, and with pride 
of place for the painting in the gallery installation, the show -- which opened 
Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (to Sept. 9) -- surprisingly 
features a relatively obscure artist as its metaphoric poster boy. 
</P>
<P>
The choice might be surprising, but it also turns out to be appropriate. The 
reason is that the Fitzwilliam, the first great university museum ever, has 
more on its mind than merely toting up celebrated names. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was established in 1816 by Richard, seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam of 
Merrion, with a bequest to Cambridge University of his art collections and 
library, and a sum of money to care for both. (A sweet portrait of 19-year-old 
Richard, by the often eccentric Joseph Wright of Derby, hangs in the show.) The 
aim, according to the bequest, was to promote "the Increase of Learning and 
other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." The selection at LACMA, which 
numbers more than 160 items, suggests the diversity and scope of that intent. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest object is a delicate, incised drawing of a reindeer on a small, 
thin shard of limestone, dating from the Paleolithic period (about 12000 BC). 
The latest is also a drawing -- a 1918 pencil study of an actress wearing a 
large hat, by Amadeo Modigliani. 
</P>
<P>
In between are Asian, Middle Eastern and, mostly, European decorative arts, 
paintings, sculptures, coins, prints and many more drawings. Not everything is 
first-rate. The graceful Paleolithic reindeer may be regarded as among the 
finest examples of naturalistic art to have survived the ages, but the 
Modigliani is at best indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the celebrated names can't always be counted on to deliver celebrated 
works. Antoine Watteau's delicate chalk study of a man playing a flute falls 
apart in the crude rendering of the hands, while the Renoir painting of a 
street scene is, typically, a chromatic mess (the otherwise sensible catalogue 
wildly claims that it compares to "Luncheon of the Boating Party," far and away 
Renoir's finest painting). In the museum's historical chain, the 19th-Century 
holdings constitute the weakest link, forming a perfunctory coda to the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
But individual excellence is not the only reason a museum -- especially a 
university museum -- assembles a collection. The Watteau drawing claims 
historical significance, serving as the model for figures in more than one 
painting by this important artist, while the Renoir is in part instructive 
simply because it dates from the same period as his great boating picture. As 
for the 19th-Century slump, it suggests the difficulty in making sense of 
contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, artistic events -- a difficulty 
common to any number of museums. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the gold far outweighs the dross in the galleries. The hard, jewel-like 
color of Bassano's early mannerist "Journey to Calvary" (circa 1540) gets my 
wholly arbitrary vote for Best of Show, while the furiously flailing limbs of 
Titian's monumental image of rape, "Tarquin and Lucretia" (1568-71), create a 
disturbing dramatic spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Peter Paul Rubens' small oil on copper, "The Death of Hippolytus" 
(circa 1611), is as startlingly fresh as if it had been painted last week. 
Carlo Dolci's 17th-Century portrait of a contemplative scholar -- a fitting 
subject for a museum at Cambridge -- carries what is surely the most 
beautifully painted shirt collar ever: Like frosted glass, the translucent 
cloth creates a dazzling shadow play for the silver cloak tassel it conceals. 
</P>
<P>
The five medieval manuscripts and the many small bronzes -- especially an 
astonishing 2nd-Century BC figure of a drunken Hercules, which is believed to 
have been broken off the shoulder of a vessel -- are almost uniformly fine. And 
for those whose sensibilities are easily offended, here's a friendly warning: 
Avoid at all costs William Hogarth's delightful pair of paintings, "Before" and 
"After." They're raucously engaging images of a courtly lad and lass, but the 
bracketed event in question would doubtless make Jesse Helms apoplectic. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitively installed show is slightly marred by an annoying glare in the 
main gallery, which makes unobstructed viewing of the large Titian, Van Dyck, 
Guercino and Salvator Rosa difficult at best. (A makeshift space, carved from 
the well of the Ahmanson Building's atrium, the room has no ceiling to support 
adequate lighting.) Still, "Treasures of the Fitzwilliam" demonstrates 
something pivotal about the foundations of the modern era, something its 
"poster boy" makes plain. 
</P>
<P>
Francois-Xavier Fabre was a fashionable and successful painter of the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries. A student of the great neo-classical master, 
Jacques-Louis David, he won the requisite prize for any aspiring French artist 
-- the Premier Grand Prix de Rome -- and promptly left for Italy. He meant to 
insert himself as the inevitable destination for the on-going march of history 
and civilization: Imperial Rome to Renaissance Italy to the neo-classical turn 
of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Fabre's aristocratic portrait of a gentleman, "Allen Smith Seated Above the 
Arno, Contemplating Florence" (1797) is about as straightforward a declaration 
of this path of ascent as could be imagined. The actual identity of the sitter 
has long been in dispute (recent speculation is that he was American, not 
British), but clearly this tourist was a man of means. The picture's 
composition derives from a famous portrait of Goethe, with a notable 
difference: Smith's head, formally posed as a refined profile, is reminiscent 
of an ancient cameo. He is seated on a crude block of stone decorated with 
Egyptian hieroglyphs, a ruined Corinthian capital at his feet and the 
Renaissance city Florence spread out before his steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in period clothes and powdered wig, Smith is also wrapped in a tunic 
that approximates a Greek chiton or a Roman toga. The loping arches of a bridge 
that spans the Arno form a rhythmic procession leading gently to the graceful 
curve of the sitter's hand -- a sitter who has thus been deftly cast by Fabre 
as a living bridge to the classical past. 
</P>
<P>
Although acquired by the Fitzwilliam only in this century, the painting's 1797 
date is roughly coincident with the university museum's 1816 founding. The 
impulse that fueled one also fueled the other. It's easy to see the 
appropriateness of Mr. Smith as "poster boy" for this illuminating exhibition.

The Non-Marriage of Cantinflas: Mario Moreno, the revered Mexican film star and 
comic known as Cantinflas, has denied that an American woman awarded $26 
million in a divorce case against him was ever his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple blackmail," Moreno, 79, told the government news agency Notimex 
when asked about the ruling against him by a state district judgein Houston 
Tuesday. "It's all a lie and that's my defense." Joyce Jett-Moreno claimed she 
was the actor's wife for 22 years. But Moreno insisted that he never remarried 
after the death of his first wife. GREG BRAXTON

Public Invests in "Bernadette': A musical about Bernadette of Lourdes, the 
French girl who saw a vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858, opened in London's 
West End Thursday, financed in part by investments from the public. Producer 
William Fonfe says he appealed to the public after wealthy investors refused to 
back "Bernadette" upon learning it was written and produced by unknowns. He 
said his production company had received about $1 million from the public, and 
he raised the rest for the $2-million production himself by re-mortgaging his 
home, among other measures. GREG BRAXTON

Long Beach Civic Opera Loses Leaders: The Long Beach Civic Light Opera is 
losing its producer Martin Wiviott and associate producer Keith Stava, who have 
led the organization into the top ranks of Southland musical theater companies 
since Wiviott arrived in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The board has begun "a national search" for a successor, said managing director 
Pegge Logefeil. Wiviott and Stava are going into an unnamed Southland 
theatrical enterprise together, said Wiviott, who declined to be more specific 
before leaving his job after the group's next show, "1776." Admitting that his 
refusal to discuss his new venture sounds "mysterious," Wiviott quipped that he 
might create "the first lunar civic light opera." GREG BRAXTON

STAGE BEAT: 'HEARTS' A PLAY AT CROSS-PURPOSES WITH ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murnon Barrow. Kelpy Lockwood. Molina Claflin. Playwright Gabriel Walsh has his 
own, curious way of doing things, and it begins with his characters' names in 
"Hearts," at the American New Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The names are halfway to the point of sounding ultra-authentic, yet also 
halfway down the primrose path of literary pretension. They're odd, yet they 
don't really sing, nor do they suggest the characters themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In a word, the names, like the play, need work. 
</P>
<P>
Only when "Hearts" is over is it clear that Walsh has been at cross-purposes 
with himself. On one hand, he wants to paint a faintly sardonic view of the 
desperate lives of three people trapped in the marginalia of a big, nameless 
American city. He's fond of having one of his people calling another on their 
delusions and/or self-deceptions, only to have the tables turned. He's very 
interested in suggesting that these three have the minds to make some kind of 
success, but couldn't get past certain hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Walsh wants to make a thinking person's love story, an Erich 
Segal tale with loopy dialogue. He believes that he can set up a triangle 
between people too tired to love, only to find that love will win out in the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't work. Richard Eden's Murnon, lumbering around his apartment on 
crutches (he's survived a death leap off a bridge, but it's still too blatant a 
device), is so thoroughly absorbed in his own inner seriousness that he's an 
emotional blank. Though Morton Lewis lets us inside Kelpy's private madness, 
which allows him to paint but not live a very good life, he always seems an 
added-on voice, an agent of the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Director Michele Martin as Molina is curiously -- considering the title -- the 
only one with heart, but together enough that we wonder why she hangs around 
such losers. (The reason she provides, related to a death wish, doesn't sound 
right coming from Martin.) 
</P>
<P>
Martin's directorial approach is a faintly updated version of 
Method-with-sweat, as if seeing the actors put out will make us believe. But 
Walsh's confused play won't be resolved so easily, although Thomas Brown's 
half-dingy, half-romantic lights and set make an asset of "Hearts' " mixed 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1540 Cahuenga Blvd., on Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until July 8. $10; 
(213) 960-1604. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Cast's 'Fault Line' Has a Few Faults 
</P>
<P>
Life can get awfully goofy in earthquake country. You may dismiss John Heaner's 
"Fault Line," at the Cast Theatre, as a slightly apoplectic one-joke play, but 
it's also emblematic of something larger. California has always been a 
wonderful, living source for writers, partly because its geology and culture 
share such profound instability. If "Fault Line" is nothing else, it is 
absolutely Californian. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Schmitt, the Cast's late artistic director and guiding light, always had a 
keen sense for Californian plays; watching "Fault Line," the first Cast 
production since Schmitt's untimely death, is to see Schmitt's ideas live on. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Heaner's play would be a kind of definitive tribute to Schmitt, if 
only it were a better work. The notion of a soldier of fortune-style 
survivalist (J. Marvin Campbell) preparing for the Big One, only to have a 
mild-mannered vagrant (Jason Reed) barge in on him from out of nowhere, is 
funny by itself, and a sly tribute to the absurdists. Heaner even takes the 
absurd allegiance a step further, when the men basically trade positions of 
power in a kind of seismic dance of death. 
</P>
<P>
But it ends up being nothing more than musical chairs, with Campbell's macho 
frustrations and Reed's ultra-sanguine manner, under Harvey Perr's direction, 
wearing out their comic welcome. The unlikely entry of a phone repair woman 
(Sweet Baby J'ai) seems a kind of admission that Heaton hasn't figured out yet 
where his play is going. In that way, too, it is very Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 At 804 N. El Centro Ave., on Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m., until July 19. 
$5; (213) 462-0265. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Sewell's 'Winter Crane' -- Studied, Serious, Strained 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, Richard C. Sewell's Anglicized Japanese tale, "Winter Crane," is 
a natural maiden voyage for the newly reorganized Fountain Theatre. Artistic 
directors Deborah Lawlor and Stephen Sachs have planned some interesting 
multicultural programming for the theater (everything from children's theater 
in Spanish to an adaptation of Vikram Seth's California verse novel, "The 
Golden Gate"). "Winter Crane" is quintessentially multicultural: a play by a 
white American about medieval Japan with non-traditional casting. 
</P>
<P>
In another sense, "Winter Crane" isn't the kind of exciting send-off a new 
theater group might hope for. Director Anne Drecktrah is certainly not abetted 
by the text. Sewell has too few play-writing instincts and too much reverence 
for Japanese folk tale tradition: the action perpetually freezes as one of his 
characters recites a life story. The stasis is odd for a story of a warrior who 
discovers love and peace while in exile from his lords. 
</P>
<P>
And Drecktrah's ideas for enlivening "Winter Crane" produce both museum theater 
and the feel of a pretentious student effort. During these moments of studied 
recitative, choreographer Bonnie Oda Homsey's dancers move across the stage 
with strained attempts at visual interpretation of the story being told. 
</P>
<P>
The actors, though, are the most strained of all, especially Rob Narita's 
clenched-teeth manner with his warrior, Uto. The more studied and serious 
"Winter Crane" becomes, the more it comes perilously close to a parody of 
Kurosawa's great film odes to samurai culture. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5060 Fountain Ave., on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 
p.m., until July 22. $14; (213) 663-1525.

'Arizona Triangle' Gets Stranded in the Desert 
</P>
<P>
Take away all of its literary allusions, its metaphorical themes of hunters, 
sisters and the eternal mother/daughter matrix, and Stacy Roberts' "Arizona 
Triangle" at the Callboard Theatre is your basic cautionary tale of what 
happens when good women do a dumb thing like hitchhiking alone on a desert 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the play might be enjoyable if it were just a thriller, riding on the 
elixir of plot. The ingredients are there, but, instead, Roberts attempts to 
draw characters with seemingly deep Oedipal and other complexes. Her dialogue 
veers between the unadorned and the decorative, as if co-written by competing 
voices. And while her sisters (played with as much conviction as possible by 
Roberts and Jeannine Wiest) wrestle with their family demons, they step into an 
extremely unlikely conflict. 
</P>
<P>
That's in Act II, at the mesa pad of Bobby (Paul Caruso). In accord with the 
play's insistent ambitions, Bobby isn't just a wily scumbag; he's a symbol of 
America gone rotten. You may admire how director Steven Nash moves things 
along, or how Richard Hoover and Jim Barbaley's set and Ken Booth's lights 
convey a world on the edge of an abyss. But there's no getting away from a play 
whose execution simply can't hold the weighty ideas it's reaching for. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8451 Melrose Place, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 and

LONG BEACH STUDIO THEATRE TRIES 'EDUCATING RITA': RENT THE MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's this? The local premiere of Willy Russell's 1980 play -- and the basis 
of a hit movie -- "Educating Rita"? 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Russell's comedy eluded the big boys of L.A. theater, but not the Long 
Beach Studio Theatre. You'd think the people in Long Beach would make noise 
about it. They don't. But there isn't much to shout about in Bill DeLuca's 
tepid production. 
</P>
<P>
The problems begin with the text. Precisely those qualities that made Russell's 
play such a natural candidate for movie adaptation -- numerous scenes 
suggesting time's passage, occasionally brief exchanges between British working 
class pupil Rita and her alcoholic, self-pitying university tutor Frank, and 
lots of descriptions of off-stage characters and action -- drag down the play 
itself.

With only one setting -- Frank's office, looking out on an Oxfordian green 
(John Vertrees' set is serviceable, if not pretty) -- scene after scene plays 
out in much the same way. Lights up. Frank working away. Rita enters for 
another day's tutorial. Lights out. The combination of Russell's structure and 
DeLuca's pacing is numbingly lockstep, reinforced by an unconscionably long, 
80-minute first act. Watching comedies should not be like doing time. 
</P>
<P>
The relief from this comes from Katrina Keay's Rita and the images she triggers 
based on the situations in Russell's dialogue. It helps not having seen the 
movie version, since Keay lets you imagine what happens off stage. There are 
the early days, when she is still working at the hairdresser's and fighting 
with her husband, who thinks she's having an affair with Frank. Then, as Rita's 
intellect grows like a huge tropical bloom, she makes new campus friends and a 
new life. Finally, Frank's primacy as mentor is threatened along with his 
university tenure and identity as a poet. 
</P>
<P>
Russell ("Shirley Valentine," "Blood Brothers") is a kind of British 
grandmaster of working class tributes and treacly sentimentality. His 
characters seldom rise above the status of symbols, always at the behest of 
their author's good-natured, audience-pleasing and terminally predictable 
narratives. "Educating Rita" so soon becomes an obvious update of "Pygmalion" 
that it's like seeing an exercise in a contemporary take on Shaw, without any 
muscularity of approach. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley Carr's Frank is similarly wimpy, his ashen performance nudged along as 
the play demands. Seldom have the actors in a two-person play seemed so far 
away from each other: Keay driving deeper and deeper into Rita with each turn 
of her intellectual road, Carr so uninterested in the demons that prevent Frank 
from putting down the bottle to write that he doesn't even manage a proper 
accent (it sounds somewhere between Denver and Johannesburg). 
</P>
<P>
If you can survive the play's lack of imagination and the production's 
claustrophobia, there is a climactic celebration of the mind that is Russell's 
only really valuable writing. In this era, that is worth shouting about.

HOMELESS ACTORS RISE IN 'LOWER DEPTHS'; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: IN HIS PRODUCTION OF THE GORKY PLAY, MICHAEL MCGEE HAS ONE GOAL IN MIND 
-- TO EMPOWER THE HOMELESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
There's little hope in this melting pot of despair. Its inhabitants are the 
disenfranchised of the metropolis -- craftsmen without a shop, artists without 
a canvas, human beings who have lost touch with humanity. They struggle for 
their bread as aimlessly as they struggle to keep the faint flame of optimism 
burning in the dark recesses of existence. 
</P>
<P>
Are they sheltered among packing crates on a downtown corner somewhere near San 
Pedro Street? Inside a plastic-draped lean-to on a vacant lot east of Main? 
</P>
<P>
No. They're the lost souls of Maxim Gorky's classic drama about conditions in 
czarist Russia that eventually led to the 1917 revolution. They live in "The 
Lower Depths," opening today at Stages Trilingual Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But take a second look at what's going on at Stages' outdoor theater. There on 
the set are the crates, shattered remnants of furniture, boards thrown against 
a wall with found plastic forming the roof -- artifacts of the homeless ghettos 
of Los Angeles. The clothes are castoffs, and at least a third of the company 
are themselves among the homeless. They don't want to be. 
</P>
<P>
The production's director, Michael McGee, had the notion that resulted in the 
staging of this play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly Michael's vision," said one of the producers, Liz Carlin, a film 
editor who also works in public relations. "I'm not a member of any 
organization. I'm a member of the human race," is Carlin's way of explaining 
her involvement in the project. "I figure we all owe something, and we're all 
here together." 
</P>
<P>
She happened to attend a poetry reading featuring the work of the Homeless 
Writers Coalition (HWC), and asked what she could do to help. She was sent to 
Hollywood's Artists Against Homelessness, where she met McGee. 
</P>
<P>
McGee's original aim was just a production of the play. But he too discovered 
HWC about a year ago, and friends like Pipeline's Scott Kelman, who suggested a 
staged reading with both homeless and professional actors, helped get the ball 
rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"We started rehearsing down on Skid Row on an empty lot," said McGee. "I got 
some actors together and we just collected people. They'd come up as we were 
working and wonder what was going on. We worked for a couple of months, then we 
did the staged reading." 
</P>
<P>
In the process he had met HWC's Dino Lewis, Southern Comfort and Jackie 
Townson, all poets from among the homeless. Lewis is no longer homeless and has 
written a play McGee will probably stage. He's also one of "Lower Depths' " 
producers, along with Carlin. Comfort and Townson are in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of talented people on Skid Row, asserted McGee, who moved to 
Los Angeles from San Francisco about two years ago. Involvement in about 30 
plays in the Bay Area (as actor or director) and a stint as acting teacher 
provided the background. The plight of the Los Angeles homeless provided the 
impulse. 
</P>
<P>
"You have an economically deprived area," he said, "you'll find a lot of 
artists there. This doesn't have anything to do with homelessness, but a lot of 
creative people tend to drift outside the system, outside of the mainstream. 
That's just something that happens. When you're a creative person and, for one 
reason or another you're unable to do your work, it can be destructive to you. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why people like Scott Kelman and myself and others believe that a 
cultural center would be a piece of gold in that area. When you tap into the 
creative life of a person, it's a healing thing. It heals them more than bread, 
more than a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
It's the dream of that cultural center that sparks this production, McGee's 
involvement with HWC and other creative stirrings on Skid Row, including his 
own Row Actors Workshop. (A homeless cultural center, Another Planet, was 
destroyed by fire last summer.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of missions down there, which is where most of the money goes," 
he said. "But, in a way, that adds a complacency. Where's the empowerment? Art 
awakens your creativity and starts moving you in a positive direction. That's 
an empowering thing. It has to do with self-respect and things that get you out 
of where you are. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of people I first met in this project are now in homes, working at 
jobs. I lost some actors, because now they have jobs. You need to have 
survival, a place to live, and money. Just lining up for food, going from one 
line to another line is not a life." 
</P>
<P>
The eventual beneficiary of the production, the cultural center, is always in 
McGee's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a helluva lot of homeless artists down there who are doing their 
work in spite of their living conditions. If we had one spot to go to -- where 
people could show up -- this is why we're all doing this play. The play spreads 
a message of good." 
</P>
<P>
As a boy of 10, Gorky himself became homeless when his mother died and his 
grandfather sent him away to earn his own living. He supported himself as an 
itinerant laborer, bootblack, errand boy, dishwasher and stevedore, all the 
while pursuing his self-education. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," McGee said with a smile, "after that he began writing about the people 
he'd met. There are going to be a lot of writers coming out of this society 
today."

PANORAMAS AND POINTED SOCIAL COMMENTARY FROM HAYASHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masumi Hayashi brings fresh vision to the old form of panoramic photography. 
Her method -- fixing the camera on a tripod, rotating and shooting at regular 
intervals, then repeating the process with the camera angled above and below 
the horizon line -- may be familiar, but the results are not. 
</P>
<P>
When she pieces together her long horizontal photo collages, she constructs 
flickering, multifaceted views that transform subjects. Parts of buildings 
don't match because of the camera's angle. The scenes often repeat after 
completing a 360-degree sweep, so that an image of the same building anchors 
two sides of a picture. This occurs in lighthearted views of Watts Towers and 
downtown Los Angeles that lend two trouble spots a fairy-tale sparkle. But 
Hayashi is after something more than attractive pictures. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her series on American cities, she photographs abandoned 
factories, pollution sites, prisons and seats of power. Such subjects are 
loaded with social commentary, and they gain in visual complexity as she 
overlays parts of the collages with three-dimensional photographs. A 
tumble-down industrial site in Youngstown, Ohio, for example, makes haunting, 
romantic pictures, but it also speaks of death in the Rust Belt. A relatively 
spare picture of the remains of the Gila Bend Relocation Center in Arizona is 
particularly poignant because it is Hayashi's birthplace. She grew up in Los 
Angeles, went off to teach in Cleveland, Ohio, and only recently located the 
site of her birth in the Arizona desert. 
</P>
<P>
The newest work in the show leads into uncharted territory that looks very 
promising. In three "portrait" collages, Hayashi has introduced human subjects 
and constructed puzzling, dream-like narratives in ambiguous spaces. The 
figures sometimes recur in different positions and sizes -- a device than lends 
an element of time and motion to still pictures. Most intriguing is a piece 
called "The Lawyer and the Prisoner," in which a tattooed nude male stands with 
outstretched arms on a table, while a man in a suit keeps a watchful eye from 
various locations. 
</P>
<P>
In a concurrent show, Robin Ryan's acrylic-on-paper paintings have a terminal 
case of confusion. On the one hand, they are gridded abstractions; on the 
other, expressionistic figurative paintings. Unfortunately, they either 
collapse from over work or just look silly -- as when a face peers out from 
behind a grid and asks, in a title, "Alfred, Is That You?" 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, Santa Monica, to July 14. 
</P>
<P>
Effortless Force: Looking at Ed Moses' new work, it's hard to imagine that he 
was once known for paintings that were almost as buttoned up as a pin-striped 
suit. In his current show of masterfully expressive abstractions, emotion hangs 
out so unabashedly that it appears as a raw fact of existence. Earthy and 
teeming with energy, this work's most remarkable quality may be that it seems 
both stunningly forceful and effortless. 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling that Moses didn't worry these paintings into life, or even 
work them around until they suited him; they just fell into place after years 
of painting. In fact, he works intuitively but uses a complex process of 
painting -- brushing, pouring, dripping and scraping. 
</P>
<P>
Moses' works on paper generally contain a central character made of a thick, 
trailed line, and throb with life amid spattered brown pigment. The paintings 
appear more like slices of some larger, natural drama -- rushing water, 
crashing waves, rumbling earth. This "sliced" effect is accentuated in two 
diptychs and one triptych. Each of the separate panels contributes to a broad, 
disjointed vista that includes poetic passages and crashing forces. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Louver, 77 Market St., Venice, to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Rigorous Abstraction: Depending on your mindset, "Absolute Contemplation," a 
handsome show of abstract painting, can be a very fast read or a slow 
revelation. Those who have become attuned to high-pitched Expressionism may 
find this work empty, but it's actually quite full of convictions about the 
purity of painting. The works -- one each by eight artists -- don't look like 
anything other than what they are, so viewers contemplate the stark physical 
aspects of what is in front of them. That usually amounts to a solid black or 
white rectangle, which may be distinguished by a meticulously worked surface, 
punctuated by brush strokes or divided by spaces between canvases. 
</P>
<P>
Scot Heywood constructs a 66-inch black square, shifts it into a diamond shape, 
then slides a slice of it out of the square format -- thus dividing space in a 
rhythmic meter. James Hayward activates a white rectangle with overlapping, 
diagonal strokes of pigment, while Michael Roberts separates two white panels 
of vertical strokes with a plain one. Penelope Krebs and Edith Baumann-Hudson 
add color to the show with no loss of discipline. Krebs' carefully weighs bold 
stripes of four different colors, while Baumann-Hudson produces a pulsing 
effect by painting brownish red bands on a brighter red background. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of rigorous abstraction was frequently seen a decade or so ago, but 
it has so little visibility now that it appears almost exotic. Once your eyes 
adapt to the subtleties, you are reminded of just how much variation there can 
be in works that appear so similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspace, 5241 Melrose Ave., to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Strange Territory: Robert Gil de Montes works in the strange territory of 
dreams and visions. Other artists often portray this terrain in wispy, ethereal 
terms, but Gil de Montes has a distinctive way of working with solid forms, 
often combining leaden people with weightless objects painted in oil on tin or 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
In "Silent Song," an immobile, masked man stands in the center of the painting 
amid a shower of yellow birds whose wings are folded close to their bodies. 
Masks, curtains and a stage-like setting lend a theatrical quality to the work, 
which can be too scattered or chaotic for its own good. When everything jells, 
his painting is powerful. One of the strongest images here is "To Open and 
Close the Eyes," portraying an earthbound man with wings who watches a pair of 
legs disappear into a theatrical sky. In another success, "Golden Tunnel," two 
blindfolded figures on wheelchairs roll on a track leading into the gaping jaws 
of a saw-toothed monster. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, Hilary Baker shows small gouache-on-paper works that allude to 
enclosures. A fence, a "wolf trap," a basket-like form or a wavy line typically 
floats in the center of a streaked, pastel background, lending an ominous 
suggestion of captivity to art that would otherwise seem carefree. 
</P>

SALSA WITH A DRIVING VIOLIN MIX WORKS FOR HANSEN BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bane of jazz players has always been the occasional need to make music for 
dancing. Violinist Susie Hansen solved the problem Wednesday night at Bentley's 
in Santa Monica with a blend of salsa and Latin jazz that kept the dancers 
dancing and the musicians swinging. 
</P>
<P>
With a group that includes three percussionists and favors pieces by Willie 
Colon and Tito Puente, Hansen takes her Latin music seriously. Her most 
effective tactic has been to incorporate her electronic instrument into the 
musical mix with arrangements that use the violin as a trumpet-like voice. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was a ball of energy -- shouting instructions to the players, knocking 
out energetic solo lines, singing backup vocals for lead singer Eddie Ortiz, 
and creating a general atmosphere of high voltage excitement. Her soloing, 
especially when percussionists David Romero, Victor Baez and Ricardo "Tiki" 
Pasillas built up a full head of steam, blended her bebop roots with the 
disjunct rhythmic accents of salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Carving out a personal arena in Latin jazz has not been an easy task for 
Hansen. Neither women instrumentalists nor violinists have ever had much of a 
role in salsa. To her credit, she seems to be succeeding while creating a brand 
of music that is as physically moving as it is intellectually stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
The Susie Hansen band continues at Bentley's every Wednesday night. DON HECKMAN

INS CHIEF TO PUSH TOUGHER POLICY ON ALIEN SMUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS and PATRICK MCDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new head of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a 
significant shift in enforcement strategies along the U.S.-Mexico border, said 
Thursday that his agency will seek to formally deport or jail smugglers of 
illegal aliens and those unauthorized immigrants who repeatedly slip into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The planned policy shift, outlined by INS Commissioner Gene McNary at a press 
conference here, represents a toughening of the INS's customary practice of 
allowing most unauthorized immigrants to return voluntarily to their homeland 
soon after capture. Officials have long targeted smugglers, but McNary said 
prosecutions would be expanded considerably. 
</P>
<P>
The new get-tough approach was immediately condemned by critics as unworkable, 
simplistic and impractical -- particularly in light of the service's shortage 
of detention space and personnel, shortcomings that some say leave the agency 
impotent to control the huge volume of people who enter the United States 
without inspection each day. 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles news conference announcing the new approach, commissioner 
McNary was vague about the details of how it will work. He said the program 
should act as a deterrent against illegal immigration. He did not elaborate on 
when it would begin or or how it might affect an already overworked INS 
bureaucracy. But the commissioner, who has been on the job for seven months, 
said the step is a necessary one to "regain control of the border," and he 
explained later that he would like to see the new policy in place soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people who are apprehended will be detained," said McNary, the former 
Missouri county executive whose comments Thursday were the most extensive 
</P>
<P>
he has made to date on the border issues that are high on his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the commissioner said, repeat offenders and alien 
smugglers will be identified and fingerprinted, something the agency does now 
only in limited cases. He said repeated offenses will mean jail terms, as 
opposed to temporary detention by the INS. 
</P>
<P>
Under current procedures, nearly all captured aliens, most of whom are 
Mexicans, declare their wish to return home, sign release forms and, in most 
instances, are quickly sent back, usually within three to eight hours. 
Immigration experts, including many INS officials, believe the practice -- 
which is largely a function of the lack of detention space and shortages of 
enforcement and court personnel -- encourages aliens to repeatedly try to jump 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just continue letting them out the back door and think you are 
enforcing the law," McNary said in an interview after the news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly targeted under the get-tough stance, McNary said, would be the San 
Diego area, where about 40% of all illegal immigration via the U.S.-Mexico 
border is believed to take place. 
</P>
<P>
The Tijuana-San Diego corridor provides the most direct access to the booming 
immigrant job markets of Southern California, a region that researchers and 
officials say is drawing more and more immigrants -- legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have estimated that about one of every three aliens attempting a 
crossing is captured. Last year, agents recorded nearly one million arrests of 
illegal immigrants in the United States; 90% were Mexican citizens, most of 
whom were quickly dispatched back home. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear precisely how immigration authorities plan to implement McNary's 
new strategy. The policy shift seemingly will require a vast increase in 
immigration detention space, but current expansion plans would appear to be far 
short of what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an obvious limitation locally in that we don't have any place to put 
them," said Ted Swofford, a spokesman in San Diego for the U.S. Border Patrol, 
the INS enforcement arm. The patrol has only 260 detention beds in San Diego, 
Swofford said, and those are "always full." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the INS now only has about 900 beds available in the entire Western 
region, which includes all of California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam. 
Current expansion plans would bring that number up to 1,400 in the next year or 
so. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego area alone, however, Border Patrol agents are recording an 
average of 1,400 arrests a day during 1990. Most of those detained sign forms 
and agree to return to Mexico, usually to attempt to enter anew through the 
rugged border terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Several immigrant-rights advocates contacted assailed McNary's proposed shift 
in policy, contending that it will be unworkable because of limited detention 
capacity and the inability of the federal court system to handle the caseload 
that would develop. Moreover, critics pointed out that it is often difficult to 
identify and make cases against smugglers and chronic border-jumpers, 
particularly since aliens routinely give false names. Authorities only take 
fingerprints of about 5% of unauthorized immigrants arrested in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"(This) could have major implications in terms of enforcement, overcrowding of 
detention facilities, the backlog in the judicial system," said Charles 
Wheeler, director of the National Immigration Law Center, a rights group in Los 
Angeles. "It's incredibly misguided to think that this will discourage the 
majority of people who now come to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Arnoldo Torres, national political adviser for the League of Latin American 
Citizens, wondered whether McNary had contemplated the consequences of his 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Has he thought about violations of rights in these detention centers?" Torres 
asked. "Has he thought about the major problems in the communities where these 
facilities will be built?" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, rights activists have long criticized conditions in INS holding 
facilities. And opposition from U.S. citizens and others has contributed in the 
last two years to the INS decision to back out of two planned new detention 
centers, one in Oakland and one in eastern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, during and after the press conference, hinted that plans for greatly 
expanded detention space are in the works for the San Diego area. But, although 
stressing the need for such facilities, he provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
"Detention is the key to enforcing the law," he said, contending that the 
threat of jail is the only way to deter undocumented border crossers. 
</P>
<P>
That view is disputed by immigrant advocates, who say that augmenting detention 
capacity will do little to halt the movement of people driven to desperation by 
economic and political disruption. 
</P>
<P>
During his Los Angeles news conference, McNary recalled how INS officials, 
strapped for detention space, housed 2,500 Central Americans last year in a 
makeshift tent city and other facilities in south Texas. However, he stopped 
short of endorsing the controversial tent-city approach for San Diego, and 
emphasized that the voluntary-return policy will remain in place for the many 
unauthorized immigrants who are not arrested for multiple illegal entries onto 
U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be able to turn this around overnight," he told reporters. 
"But we'll try and identify (alien) smugglers . . . fingerprint them, detain 
them." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his overall toughened approach, McNary repeated an earlier vow to 
attempt to bolster the uniformed strength of the Border Patrol in the San Diego 
by 260 agents, to about 1,000 officers, within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The extra personnel, he said, would be shifted from other duties elsewhere in 
the country and would be brought in from among new agents graduating from the 
Border Patrol academy in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, McNary also voiced the hope that the escalating 
numbers of robberies and assaults against migrants along the border in San 
Diego could be reduced through a variety of methods -- jailing more people for 
long periods, installing lights in border zones, posting more border guards, 
and improving fences and other barriers. The large groups that now gather daily 
along the border contribute to crime and other disruption, McNary said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the crowds in the staging areas in San Diego can be dispersed," 
McNary said. "That's not a border problem, that's a humanity problem. . . . It 
is a situation that is intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed particular support for the notion of installing more lights, which 
he called "perhaps the best technique in eliminating the violence and the 
crowds of people." 
</P>
<P>
However, McNary attempted to distance himself publicly from the huge and 
controversial Light Up the Border movement. That San Diego-based group -- 
criticized by some as a throwback to U.S. nativist movements of the past -- has 
attempted to draw attention to illegal immigration by massing along the 
international boundary line and shining vehicle headlights southward. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will probably just run their batteries down," McNary said of the 
group's tactic. 
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner acknowledged that the group had galvanized a widespread 
perception that the border is "out of control," and, he added, "You don't need 
1,000 people putting on their headlights to tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
Later, as part of his first Los Angeles visit to inspect INS facilities, McNary 
told a Town Hall luncheon audience that he personally favors a combined point 
system and lottery to allow some foreigners with no "family or prospective 
employer" connections to lawfully immigrate to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our skill-based immigration is now employer-driven," he said in 
prepared remarks. "I'd like to see someone without that connection have a 
chance, too. A person who says, 'I just want to work in America and raise my 
family there,' would bring as many benefits to this country as someone with a 
much-desired occupational skill."

EPA WON'T LET PRINCESS LOUISE REST IN PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The saga continues. 
</P>
<P>
When we last left the former cruise ship Princess Louise, the ill-fated vessel 
was lying 900 feet deep in the outer San Pedro Channel, where it sank en route 
to its intended resting place off the coast of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The sinking of the 330-foot liner was to have ended its final sorry days -- 
bankrupt as a business, no longer seaworthy, capsizing in a Terminal Island 
shipyard, even plundered by rogue divers. 
</P>
<P>
At last, many had thought Wednesday, the onetime "Queen of the Northern Seas" 
would rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency officials said they want the 
Princess Louise Moved from its watery grave. Turns out the ship sank too close 
to an ocean dump site under the federal agency's jurisdiction, EPA officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the ship to be moved as quickly as possible, if it's possible, to 
another location," EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Where it sits now, according to Grunwald and EPA oceanographer Pat Cotter, the 
ship could interfere with the EPA's study of the dump site, where hundreds of 
thousands of tons of dredge material are discarded each year by the ports of 
Los Angeles and Long Beach. The dump, with a radius of 1,000 yards, has been in 
use for decades, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to monitor that site and take sea-bottom samples to collect fish and 
invertebrates. So if we're trying to find out what's out there and bingo, our 
nets hit the ship, it could be costly," Cotter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd lose lots of time. We'd lose lots of money. And we'd lose lots of 
scientific samples. It could be a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
But moving the Princess Louise may be an even bigger problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking science fiction, if you're talking Hollywood, it can be 
done. But if you're talking real life, no," said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. F. L. 
McClain, who supervised the escorting of the Princess Louise out to sea 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's depth, condition and history, McClain said, all suggest that 
everyone might be better off just leaving it where it lies. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it took a team of divers, naval architects and stout salvagers more 
than two months to raise the Princess Louise from about 45 feet of water at 
Berth 241 in Terminal Island. Until two weeks ago, the 2,300-ton vessel sat 
listing to starboard ever since mysteriously capsizing Oct. 30 as it underwent 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even after it was raised upright, the ship's frailty was obvious and salvage 
crews continued to work day and night to prepare it for its last voyage -- the 
one it never completed. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said there was no stopping it from sinking where it did. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to save it, but they couldn't," McClain said. Mud and other debris 
from the ship's hull clogged equipment and made it impossible to keep it 
afloat, McClain said. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen Martech USA Inc. salvage divers tried to free the pumps until the 
very end, McClain said. "They stayed aboard until the main deck was awash and 
finally had to leave. There was nothing else they could do." 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said they would consult with the Coast Guard, marine engineers 
and the Princess Louise's owner and salvager, Willem Boelman, about the 
possibility of moving the vessel to deeper waters. Boelman returned to 
Vancouver, Canada, after the ship sank and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know what our options are," Cotter said.

RECLAIMING THE FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER RUNAWAY GRADUATES AFTER OVERCOMING ADDICTION TO CRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Soeder started using marijuana when she was 8 years old, sneaking puffs 
occasionally before heading off to third-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
By age 12, Jane had graduated to cocaine. And when she reached 15, she became 
addicted to crack. It was then that she ran away from her comfortable 
middle-class home in Simi Valley to a Van Nuys crack house, where she lived 
with her boyfriend and a steady stream of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I hung out with druggies and gang-affiliated people," said Jane, now 17. "It 
just seemed like fun. I used to like getting into trouble, I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
Getting a high school diploma seemed a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night, in the last wave of high school graduations in Ventura 
County, Jane graduated from Royal High School in Simi Valley, a year ahead of 
schedule, with a 3.5 grade-point average and plans for college and, eventually, 
law school. 
</P>
<P>
Jane was one of 25 students formerly identified as potential dropouts who 
graduated from Royal High with the help of a special program for "at-risk" 
students. Of the 500 Royal graduates, the story of Jane's turnaround and her 
efforts to graduate is particularly remarkable, Royal High officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about an awfully, awfully bright young lady," said Assistant 
Principal Robert LaBelle, who helped Jane make the transition from drug 
rehabilitation to a regular high school program. "It's a real success story." 
</P>
<P>
Jane credits her family, teachers and counselors at the high school and at a 
private rehabilitation program with helping her get back on track. When she ran 
away, Jane had just completed ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I was staying in the deeper parts of Van Nuys," Jane said. "I was living in a 
crack house. I had been doing drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Jane's parents had noticed that she was keeping company with a rough crowd, but 
did not suspect drug use because her grades, which had always been high, did 
not drop significantly -- only from A's to Bs. Her rebellious behavior seemed 
like a normal phase that many teen-agers go through, said Alice Soeder, Jane's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
However, when Jane didn't return home one night and her parents noticed that 
some of her clothes were missing, they realized that she had run away. "It was 
a real shock to us," Alice Soeder said. "We contacted her friends and filed a 
missing persons report with Simi police." 
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of a counseling program, the Soeders hired investigators 
from a private ambulance service in Canoga Park, which specializes in tracking 
down teen-agers with drug problems and transporting them to hospital 
rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
The agency used records of telephone calls Jane made before she left home to 
pinpoint the area where she had fled, then circulated her photograph. Within 
two days, they found Jane near Saticoy Street and Van Nuys Boulevard, an area 
her mother described as "heavily infested with drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a place you really would not want your child to be, believe me," Alice 
Soeder said. "Drug dealers, prostitutes, gangs. . . . This was the baby we had 
planned, so it really broke our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Jane said she remembers little of the two-week period she lived in the crack 
house but recalls the day she was found. "When they spotted me, I was very high 
on crack," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of her older sister, Linda, and other family members, the 
investigators eventually persuaded Jane to leave. Police raided the crack house 
the next day, Alice Soeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Jane was immediately transported to a drug rehabilitation program at the 
Anacapa Adventist Hospital in Port Hueneme, where she remained locked away for 
nearly three months while undergoing therapy and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Huhn, a counselor at Anacapa, said the average stay at the hospital is 30 
to 45 days. But Jane said her stay was nearly twice that. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in there so long because it took me a long time to see the light, for 
them to turn me around," Jane said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jane made good use of her time. Through courses offered at Anacapa in 
conjunction with the Oxnard Union High School District, she earned 35 high 
school credits, enabling her -- when she was finally released -- to enroll at 
Royal High a semester ahead of her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"We were required to go to school at the hospital," Jane said. "Most of the 
people in there would goof around, but I thought about it and decided not to." 
</P>
<P>
At Royal High, Jane continued her fast-track course, taking extra classes 
through an evening program the school offers and working in the administration 
office after school. She also received guidance and counseling from Kerry 
Jackson, coordinator of the program for students at risk of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I probably would not have stayed in school without this program," Jane 
said. "I've always had someone to turn to. There are no closed doors." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alice Soeder: "Without the high-risk program, she really would have been 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson called Jane "very intelligent, strong-willed and determined. She took 
those characteristics and turned them around, used them for something 
productive rather than something destructive." 
</P>
<P>
The Soeder family has been through therapy together, Alice Soeder said, and is 
working to help Jane continue her recovery. "I'm not saying things are perfect 
-- they're not," Alice Soeder said. "We have a lot of problems, but we're 
taking them one day at a time, one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Because of what she has overcome, graduation was a particularly poignant 
occasion for the circle of family and friends who have helped her, Jane said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very big," Jane said. "I'm very excited. My whole family is excited, 
and my friends. I'm glad I have all their support. Without it, I don't think 
I'd have made it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with earning her high school diploma, Jane said she has learned a few 
hard lessons that she hopes will help her as she heads to college. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I got a chance this early to go through something like this," Jane 
said. "I have a different outlook on life. I've lived both the ways I can go. I 
know what it's like on the downside, and I know what it's like now."

LOAN SOUGHT FOR OLYMPIC CENTER SNAGS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: A STATE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE WANTS MORE INFORMATION ON $15-MILLION 
LOAN FOR TRAINING CENTER IN CHULA VISTA THAT LACKS COLLATERAL. 
</P>

<P>
Bothered by the unusual absence of collateral, members of a key legislative 
budget committee Thursday balked at approving a $15-million unsecured loan to a 
San Diego-based foundation hoping to build a year-round Olympic training center 
in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the six-member budget conference committee requested more 
information about the proposed transaction, some members of the panel predicted 
that questions about the collateral could imperil the loan request. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, it is not something that can easily be passed," Assemblywoman 
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said during a break in the budget discussions. 
"It falls in the area of being in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), also a member of the conference committee: 
"If there's no collateral, there should be no deal. Any deal without collateral 
is a bad deal." 
</P>
<P>
The state loan is to be paid in $5-million installments over the next three 
years to the San Diego National Sports Training Foundation, a nonprofit group 
founded by former San Diego City Councilwoman Gloria McColl and developer Ernie 
Hahn. Amid much fanfare last weekend, the foundation broke ground for a 
proposed $60-million, state-of-the-art training center supporters say will be a 
tourist magnet on the western shore of Lower Otay Lake Reservoir in Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was mandated last year by a controversial law that provided for the 
$15 million to be paid back to the state's general fund through the sale of 
specialized Olympic training-center license plates. 
</P>
<P>
Nagging doubts about the reliability of those sales caused Gov. George 
Deukmejian to require the foundation to guarantee the loan as an extra 
precaution before he signed the bill requiring the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Times revealed last week that the final terms of the loan, as negotiated by 
the Department of Commerce and approved last week, fail to require the 
foundation to 
</P>
<P>
set aside assets or financial reserves to back up its written promise to pay 
off the balance of the loan in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
And a high-ranking Commerce Department administrator acknowledged to The Times 
that the "very unusual" arrangement could mean that the state would be out its 
money if the foundation changes its mind or folds before the loan comes due in 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn and foundation executive vice president David Neilsen both have maintained 
that the group is committed to making sure the state is repaid. Chances that 
the nonprofit foundation will default are "very, very remote," said Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
However, legislators on the six-person budget conference committee expressed 
doubts Thursday about the propriety of the loan and gave indications that it 
might not pass muster, especially during a time when lawmakers are scrambling 
to cut social programs to make up for a projected $3.6-billion shortfall in 
next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, consisting of three members each from the Assembly and Senate, is 
charged with the crucial task of working out the differences in budget 
proposals between the two chambers of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
When the subject of the Olympic training center loan came up, both Waters and 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the powerful 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee, voiced opposition and held the item over for 
further explanation about the lack of collateral. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is a procedural step, the move by the two Assembly members bodes 
ill for the loan. Since there are only six members on the panel, rejection by 
any two members from either the Assembly or the Senate spells almost certain 
doom for any budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this bears more discussion," Waters said during the break. "I think it 
looks suspicious. Not good. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't have collateral, it would be outrageous to lend them money," she 
said. "No financial institution would operate this way. I don't know why they 
aren't getting private financing. It is a private, nonprofit organization." 
</P>
<P>
Neilsen said Thursday he didn't know how the foundation would respond to the 
questions about the loan by legislators. "It's still to be discussed further in 
conference committee and we're hoping for the best," he said.

NEW JUDGE SOUGHT FOR DRIVER'S 2ND MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County prosecutor said Thursday that he wants to prevent Diane Mannes 
from being tried on murder charges by the same judge who dismissed identical 
charges against her last year. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn filed a motion to have Judge Robert Soares 
replaced by another judge before Mannes goes to trial on July 30. Glynn said 
Soares should excuse himself because "he has expressed an opinion about the 
case that showed prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Mannes, 35, of Somis, pleaded not guilty Thursday to three counts of murder in 
the drunk driving deaths of three young men who were walking on the shoulder of 
the Ventura Freeway on the Conejo Grade last year. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31, 1989, Mannes' Ford Bronco slammed into Jacob Boyd, 14, and Joshua 
Oxenreider, 19, both of Camarillo, and Scott Mullins, 20, of Mansfield, Ohio, 
killing them and injuring two of their friends. Tests showed that her blood 
contained twice the 0.10% legal definition of drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 17, a Superior Court jury convicted Mannes of two felony drunk driving 
charges but deadlocked on three second-degree murder charges. Glynn moved to 
retry Mannes on the murder charges, but Soares refused to reset the case for 
trial and dismissed the charges. His ruling cited a lack of evidence that 
Mannes acted with malice or was aware of her actions. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling said a second trial would be "a waste of time and money" and 
concluded, "There is no likelihood that a retrial on these charges will result 
in a unanimous verdict of murder." 
</P>
<P>
Glynn refiled murder charges in Municipal Court, where a judge refused Deputy 
Public Defender Robert Dahlstedt's motion to have them dismissed. Dahlstedt 
appealed that judge's ruling on grounds of double jeopardy -- an appeal that 
was rejected in Superior Court, 2nd District Court of Appeal and state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dahlstedt complicated the latest round of courtroom maneuverings 
by filing a highly unusual plea of illegal double jeopardy on Mannes' behalf. 
Dahlstedt argued that Mannes should not be tried a second time after a jury had 
failed to convict her the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt asked Soares to schedule two separate trials: one for the plea of 
illegal double jeopardy and one for the criminal charges. The public defender 
said that if a jury finds that a second criminal trial would place Mannes in 
double jeopardy, then no murder trial can be held. 
</P>
<P>
Soares scheduled both trials for July 30, when he -- or the judge who replaces 
him -- will decide whether one or two juries should hear the matters. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt also filed a motion Thursday to suspend Proposition 115 for Mannes' 
criminal trial and allow attorneys, not the judge, to choose the juries. 
Proposition 115 was passed on June 5, giving judges the responsibility of 
choosing juries. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case like this, there's lots of publicity and it's a very emotional 
case," Dahlstedt said after the arraignment. "I don't think judges who aren't 
practiced in picking juries would be able to question jurors and draw out any 
biases they might have." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing will be held June 27 on that motion and on Glynn's motion to have 
Soares replaced. 
</P>
<P>
After arraignment, Mannes was returned to Ventura County Jail, where she is 
serving four years for the felony drunk-driving charges.

SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS REJECT UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a conciliatory gesture toward controversial school Supt. Cesare Caldarelli 
Jr., administrators in the Ventura school district have voted more than 2 to 1 
not to form a union, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
School principals, assistant principals, school psychologists and other 
mid-level managers hope to set a good tone for the next school year by meeting 
regularly with Caldarelli to discuss problems, said Terry Holts, president of 
the Ventura Administrators Assn., which conducted the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The tally for the mail-in ballot was 40 to 19. There are 80 administrators in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was to work with Caldarelli," said Holts, assistant principal at 
Cabrillo Middle School. "This is what I personally had hoped would come out of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Caldarelli was on vacation and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A group of eight to 12 administrators is to meet with Caldarelli in August, 
Holts said. 
</P>
<P>
Although principals and others have met occasionally with Caldarelli in the 
past, next year's meetings will be ongoing and scheduled, Holts said. 
</P>
<P>
A facilitator from the Assn. of California School Administrators, a statewide 
professional group, has been asked to serve as a mediator between 
administrators and upper-level management in the 25-school district, Holts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The facilitator will present samples of policies and procedures that are used 
in other school districts to aid Ventura officials in improving communication 
between Caldarelli and his administrators, Holts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make every effort to make sure our members are satisfied with 
any new policies or procedures we come up with," Holts said. 
</P>
<P>
Asa Reaves, a professional services executive with the association's Los 
Alamitos office, said representatives from the 15,000-member group are often 
called in to help school districts settle labor or management disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Unrest in the Ventura district began last fall after some administrators 
complained that Caldarelli was making management decisions that affected their 
jobs without consulting them. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators were particularly upset when they received notices in March 
informing them that they could be reassigned. Some administrators feared that 
reassignment could lead to lower-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers this month voted overwhelmingly to express no confidence in Caldarelli 
and ask the school board to remove him. Ninety-three percent of the teachers, 
or 524 of the 660-member Ventura Unified Educators Assn., supported the 
no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
However, blue-collar employees, including supervisors of maintenance workers, 
skilled laborers and bus drivers, sent a letter expressing support for 
Caldarelli.

Ventura Port District commissioners have approved a proposed settlement that 
would resolve a multimillion-dollar lawsuit with creditors who helped finance 
the construction of Harbor Village in the Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Village, a commercial and entertainment center, was completed in 1982 
and was financed in part by a $9.5-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
But four years later the developer, Ocean Services Corp. of Ventura, went 
bankrupt, leaving the harbor district liable for $6.5 million in bond payments 
plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, the creditors' trustee, filed a lawsuit against the district 
to recover its losses. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Harbor General Manager Richard Parsons said Thursday that the terms of 
the settlement are not being disclosed because the district's creditors have 
yet to accept the agreement proposal. The settlement also must be approved by 
the Ventura Superior Court, where a trial is scheduled to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said that under the proposed agreement, the district would lease the 
village to Beauchamp Enterprises of Newport Beach and use the lease money to 
pay its creditors an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons said the district recognizes a $7-million debt, but the bank is asking 
for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the settlement we're proposing is much closer to their figure 
than it is to ours," he said. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER FOUND GUILTY OF BURGLARY, LEWD 
CONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Los Angeles police officer was convicted Thursday of burglary and 
sexual battery for entering a home under the pretense of an investigation and 
molesting a 14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Tanabe, 32, a nine-year veteran of the Police Department, hung his head 
as the jury verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe was found guilty of two counts of residential burglary, one count of 
lewd conduct on a child committed by force and one count of sexual battery. 
Superior Court Judge Michael Huff allowed Tanabe to remain free on $250,000 
bail pending sentencing July 20. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe, a member of the Police Department's elite Metro Division, demanded to 
be let into the girl's Hollywood home on Jan. 29, 1989, falsely claiming that 
he wanted to investigate a scream he heard, prosecutors said. After he was 
allowed in by the girl's parents, Tanabe went to the girl's bedroom, where he 
fondled her while pretending to search her, prosecutors said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY TRANSPORTING TOXIC 
WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were indicted Thursday for allegedly storing toxic waste at their 
company facilities in Rancho Dominguez and shipping it to an illegal site in 
Nevada, the U.S. attorney's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Robert Speach, 66, of Rancho Palos Verdes, former president of ENV 
Inc., and Charles E. Welch, 54, of San Clemente, former vice president of ENV, 
were charged with 15 counts of illegal storage and transportation, Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Gary S. Lincenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Speach and Welch will be arraigned July 2. Neither could be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Between August, 1986, and July, 1987, ENV stored and then shipped to Nevada 406 
55-gallon drums of waste water treatment sludge from electroplating operations, 
the indictment said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista Superior Court jury on Thursday recommended the death penalty for Kurt 
Michaels, a 24-year-old Oceanside transient and former Marine who killed his 
girlfriend's mother in her Escondido apartment in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels had admitted stabbing to death JoAnn Clemons, 43, but argued that he 
should not be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed he was responding to the woman's physical abuse against her 
daughter, Christina Clemons, his 17-year-old girlfriend at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels sat impassively as the jury's recommendation was read in the courtroom 
of Judge J. Morgan Lester, after three days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
By state law, death sentences are automatically appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels was convicted June 6 for the stabbing, and the jury at the time found 
four special circumstances -- that Michaels killed for financial gain, while 
lying in wait, and in the commission of a burglary and a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Formal pronouncement of the sentence will be July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Broderick, in arguing for Michaels' death, said in his 
closing arguments that, given his penchant for violence, Michaels would 
probably order his own death if he were on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels served as his own attorney during the trial, but most of the legal 
chores were handled by his court-appointed legal assistant, attorney Mark 
Chambers, who argued unsuccessfully to the jury that, given Michael's own, 
troubled background as an abused child and drug user, he should be forgiven and 
sentenced instead to life in prison.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WORKERS PROTEST PROPOSED PARKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of county employees demonstrated Thursday to protest a proposal to 
charge workers for parking in the Civic Center area -- parking that they now 
receive for free. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Service Employees International Union, Local 660, 
released a plan they said is more "consistent" with meeting clean air 
requirements than the plan the county has said could be adopted July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The county, like other large employers, is required to adopt a plan to reduce 
traffic congestion to help clean up the air in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District approved the county's plan 
several months ago but employees say it will actually increase traffic in the 
Civic Center area. A spokesman for the county could not be immediately reached 
for comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FORGING ARTISTS' 
WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man accused of forging art who used to tool about Los Angeles in a white 
Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Lamborghini was granted the services of a public 
defender in a Superior Court proceeding Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Gene Tetro, who is described by investigators as one of the nation's 
most prolific art forgers, pleaded not guilty to one count of grand theft and 
67 counts that he faked reproductions of the works of artists Marc Chagall, 
Joan Miro, Norman Rockwell and Hiro Yamagata. 
</P>
<P>
He is accused of conspiring with art dealer Mark Henry Sawicki, 32, of Agoura 
to defraud other art dealers by selling them fake Yamagata watercolors and 
lithographs of other artists' works. 
</P>
<P>
Tetro, who had previously been represented by private attorney George Porter, 
was granted a public defender after an application describing his present 
financial status was reviewed by the court. Tetro may be assessed the cost of 
representation, a spokesman for the public defender's office said.

A 21-year-old Oxnard man was arrested Thursday and held on suspicion of 
attempted murder and rape in connection with an assault on a 54-year-old woman 
last week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
George Arlis Valenzuela was arrested in the 500 block of East Date Street, said 
Oxnard Police Lt. Gordon Hubbard. He is being held at Ventura County Jail in 
lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
On June 15, the Oxnard woman was returning to her room in the Ambassador Hotel 
on Oxnard Boulevard when a man who had been following her pulled her inside an 
open door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man raped the woman and stabbed her several times in her upper torso before 
fleeing, police said. JOCELYN STEWART

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS APPROVE CANYON DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors Thursday approved a 69-home development in 
Malibu's scenic Encinal Canyon after the developer abandoned plans to include 
an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project were relieved that the developer, Anden-VMS Ranch 
Malibu Venture, scaled down the development, but they argued that the 1.9 cubic 
yards of grading needed to build the homes will alter the fragile character of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-nine homes is the absolute maximum the zoning will allow if it were a 
perfect situation, but this is not a perfect situation," Sally Womack, a member 
of the West Malibu Community Council, told the supervisors.

Vandals who broke into Jill Williamson's Pacoima home Wednesday did more than 
steal a VCR and jewelry -- they defaced the home with racial slurs in what 
police are calling a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred between 7:30 a.m. and noon Wednesday. Vandals ransacked a 
room, slashed a water bed and scrawled racial slurs on the walls of the living 
room, Los Angeles Police Detective Larry Queen said. "The fact that someone 
marked the epithet on the walls classifies it as a hate crime," Queen said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY DROPS PLAN FOR DEPARTMENT HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is planning a major shake-up in the commissions that oversee 
the City Hall bureaucracy, but has abandoned plans to hold unprecedented 
hearings on the performance of individual departments, a spokesman disclosed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had announced his intent to hold the performance hearings for each of 
21 city departments Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in March, he said, a department selected by his office would be the 
subject of a two-day hearing during which the public would be able to offer 
their pet peeves about the bureaucracy. The hearings were to have continued on 
a monthly basis until all 21 departments had been held up to public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which he had proclaimed would have a major impact on city 
departments, never got off the ground and has been abandoned, his press 
secretary, Bill Chandler, said Thursday.

A Carson man found his 21-year-old nephew bound and stabbed to death in the

TROPICAL STORM SHOULDN'T WET WEEKEND PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas, the fourth tropical storm this year, is more than 1,000 miles south of 
San Diego and is not likely to turn into a hurricane over the weekend, 
according to the National Weather Service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
With winds clocked at 65 m.p.h., the storm is hovering near Acapulco and moving 
slowly north at 5 m.p.h, said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. 
</P>
<P>
High-altitude winds may bring in some moisture from the storm, causing 
increasing cloudiness and humidity in the mountains and deserts Sunday, but no 
rain is expected at least through the weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara noted, however, that tropical storms are unpredictable. Hurricanes 
feed off warm ocean waters, and the water temperatures off San Diego are 69 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Yellowtails start biting when the water is warm, and the yellowtails are 
boiling to the south of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service is keeping an eye on satellite pictures of Douglas, but, in 
the meantime, people attending the Del Mar Fair and enjoying the first weekend 
of summer should be able to count on fair skies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After warming up to it for weeks, summer officially arrived Thursday, marking 
the longest day of the year. At 8:33 a.m., the sun reached its summer solstice, 
its farthest point north of the Equator for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The first weekend of summer will be typical for this time of year, with lots of 
sunshine, and night and morning low coastal clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have the protective clouding holding down temperatures in the 
morning, it would be blistering hot," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, temperatures will vary from 66 to 71 today and through the 
weekend, Shigehara said. Despite the southerly storms, surf will peak at only 2 
to 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal temperatures are expected to range from 70 to 78 during the day and 58 
to 64 at night, with inland highs pushing into the 80s.

$27.5-MILLION WINNER TELLS HOW IT'S DONE; 
</P>
<P>
LOTTERY: THE ACCOUNTANT CHOSE NUMBERS THAT CAME UP OFTEN, THEN DESIGNED A 
COMPUTER PROGRAM TO SCRAMBLE THEM INTO COMBINATIONS. AN OFFICIAL JUST CALLS HIM 
'A VERY LUCKY MAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Sherman Oaks accountant, who persisted for more than a year playing a 
computerized Lotto "system" based on numbers he said won more frequently, 
Thursday calmly accepted the news that he had won $27.58 million, the richest 
single lottery haul in California history. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ralph Laird said he had six entries in Wednesday's game in which 
he guessed five of the six prize numbers, winning him an additional $16,354 if 
the numbers are confirmed by lottery officials. 
</P>
<P>
A white limousine, hired for him by lottery officials, waited outside the Van 
Nuys state lottery building and photographers jostled for pictures of him and 
his family. But Laird, dressed in a conservative suit, reacted coolly to his 
bounty and offered no plans for a spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
Laird, 58, matter-of-factly described to reporters the system that gave him the 
jackpot ticket with all six winning numbers -- 8, 39, 12, 20, 46, and 22. 
</P>
<P>
Laird said that about a year ago he "just looked at the previous winning Lotto 
numbers" and chose 10 he said "seemed" to come up more often, then designed a 
program on his home computer to scramble them into every possible combination. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb dismissed Laird's system, saying he won 
because "he's a very lucky man. 
</P>
<P>
"Any statistician can tell you . . . that lottery draws are totally random," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But each week, Laird gambled between $20 and $30 on Lotto tickets at Al 
Weintraub's Wines and Spirits of the World on Saugus Avenue in Sherman Oaks. He 
spent $26 there Wednesday night, then spread his tickets on the coffee table 
and watched the televised Lotto drawing. 
</P>
<P>
His wife of 38 years, Carlene, was getting their 3-year-old granddaughter ready 
for bed in the next room, when she heard her husband say: "The fat lady sang." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what he meant," Carlene Laird said.

"I've played Lotto for a long time now, and it was really hard to imagine that 
we had won," Laird said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
The Lairds' big jackpot is worth $1.34 million a year for 20 years, before 
taxes. Lottery officials said Laird's first check -- for $1,103,200 after a 
deduction for partial payment of federal taxes -- will arrive in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The largest California jackpot, $68.5 million, was divided between four winners 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
Laird, as composed as if he were discussing a client's portfolio, announced 
that he will retire from his job as a financial analyst, invest his money and 
use it to help his three grown children further their careers and buy homes. 
The money probably will allow him to spend more time at Mill Station, the 
Chardonnay vineyard he co-owns in Sonoma County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlene Laird said she plans to retire from her job as a legal secretary for 
the Century City law firm of Gendel, Raskoff, Shapiro and Quittner. Asked what 
type of law she specialized in, she giggled, "Bankruptcy!" 
</P>
<P>
The biggest splurge contemplated by the Lairds: remodeling a bathroom in the 
four-bedroom Sherman Oaks home they have owned since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the Lairds said they want to make life more comfortable for their 
parents and for their grown children: David, 36, a golf pro in San Diego; John, 
33, a psychology student; and Diane, 27, a fifth-grade teacher at Overland 
Avenue School in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Wingfield and her husband, William, 25, said that they have been scraping 
together money for a down payment on a home since their marriage a year ago. 
The Lairds said that now they can help with that, as well as assisting David in 
getting his career established. 
</P>
<P>
John Laird said he had just completed his master's degree in psychology. "I 
want to go on for my Ph.D., but it's real expensive," he said during the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"But, big deal," he added with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
The Lairds said that they are not a particularly lucky family. "I won two mops 
at a Stanley party one time," said Carlene Laird. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Laird said that despite the computer program that worked for him, he 
doesn't consider himself a lottery wizard. He has not, in fact, decided how to 
fit his strategy to the new Lotto game, beginning Saturday, in which winners 
must pick six prize numbers out of 53 numbers instead of 49. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not mathematical enough to understand the difference between 49 and 53," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, whose liquor store sold a second-place ticket last year, said the 
Lairds came into the store Thursday morning to tell him about their jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Oh, baloney,' because they were so calm," Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub promptly called the state lottery headquarters and learned that his 
store had indeed sold the jackpot ticket, netting him $137,900. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Nochenson, San Fernando Valley district lottery manager, said most jackpot 
winners are not as subdued as the Lairds, but nearly all are in shock when they 
learn of their instant fortunes. Eventually, the news sinks in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it takes a day, sometimes it takes a week, but it sinks," said 
Nochenson.

SCHOOL BOARD MAKES MORE CUTS IN BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MEMBERS PUT OFF CONTROVERSIAL REDUCTIONS IN SOME WORKERS' HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slogging its way through what one member called "the ugly zone," the Los 
Angeles Board of Education squeezed out another $23 million in budget cuts on 
Thursday while postponing the very toughest decisions for yet a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed to tap its workers compensation insurance fund, raise fees for 
groups using school facilities and take out loans to pay for three construction 
projects and school police cars. It also sliced into services including 
gardening, landscaping, custodial maintenance, public information and 
curriculum specialists in a variety of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
But it delayed until Monday action on several other proposals, including one 
that would cut the work hours of large numbers of non-teaching employees, in 
effect forcing them to take 5% pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters held out hope that she and Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles) can work out a plan over the weekend to help the 
district. Without specifying what she and Waters have in mind "because it's not 
fleshed out yet," Waters persuaded board members to agree to re-examine the 
nearly 1,000 job cuts made so far if she has something concrete to offer 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the state -- which provides roughly 75% of the district's revenues 
-- has troubles of its own in the form of a deficit estimated at $2 billion, 
most board members expressed skepticism that even the powerful Waters can help. 
</P>
<P>
With $30 million to go in the board's weeks-long effort to close by June 30 a 
$220-million hole in the next fiscal year's budget, the options left are a 
series of painful proposals that would hit the schools harder and could cost 
even more jobs. At a time when enrollment in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District is growing by 15,000 pupils per year, the board must trim more than 5% 
from an annual spending package of more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me where we are in the budget process, and I tell them we are in 
the ugly zone," board member Warren Furutani lamented. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to cut the hours of vast numbers of employees who work 11 or 12 
months of the year, from custodians and cafeteria workers to top 
administrators, is controversial and could trigger problems with labor 
contracts or district personnel rules. It would affect some workers already hit 
in earlier budget-cutting rounds and, if limited to employees who do not work 
at schools, would create a two-tier system for workers who perform the same job 
but at different locations. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us are going to be financing the teachers' raises out of our own 
paychecks," one central office employee complained. 
</P>
<P>
She was alluding to the 8% annual pay raises for three years that the board 
granted teachers last year to settle their strike. Most other employees then 
got the same raises, increasing the already high proportion of the district's 
general fund budget -- 82% in 1989-90 -- that goes to salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Once the board finishes this year's cuts, it will need to turn its attention to 
long-term solutions of what has become a steadily worsening financial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary cause of (the school district's) financial crisis is embedded in 
the fact that annual costs -- primarily salaries and fringe benefits -- are 
rising at a rate in excess of revenues," Leonard R. Fuller, a partner in the 
accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said in a summary of a report 
commissioned to guide the district into calmer financial waters.

<P>
The Santa Paula City Council has launched an attack on gang warfare by 
deploying a gang task force and allocating more funds to erase graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted earlier this week to approve the strategy proposed by 
Santa Paula Police Chief Walt Adair to create a two-city task force involving 
officers from the Santa Paula and Ventura police departments. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also approved the creation of a program to paint over gang 
graffiti scrawled on public and private property. 
</P>
<P>
The program, with an estimated cost of $5,000 to $8,000, will include a 
telephone hot line so residents can report fresh graffiti to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Police have assigned three officers to the task force, and Ventura 
police have assigned two, with six more on call. PSYCHE PASCUAL

Organizers of a countywide reading program will launch Moorpark's first adult

</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Library Services Agency's reading program for adults is 
looking for tutors, as well as adults who are interested in participating in 
the program, said Pat Flanigan, adult reading program coordinator for the 
agency. A training program has been set for July 14 at the Moorpark Community 
Center.

AMBULANCE STATION PROPOSAL RESISTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council has spurned a rush proposal to raise taxes for a 
city-run ambulance station, demanding to know how much establishing local 
ambulance service would cost before supporting the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Two council members, Clint Harper and Eloise Brown, on Wednesday urged their 
colleagues to create a tax that would pay for a new ambulance station in 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Harper and Brown, frustrated with the slow ambulance service from an 
out-of-town operator, want to put the new tax on the November ballot. The 
deadline for ballot measures is about a month away. 
</P>
<P>
But their colleagues would not rush into raising taxes for an ambulance station 
without knowing more about its costs. 
</P>
<P>
Harper told his colleagues that preliminary estimates show that the ambulance 
station could cost up to $500,000 a year to operate, financed through a special 
fee or a tax that would be assessed each of the city's 8,500 taxpaying 
households. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds real good, but the bottom line is it's a half-million out of the 
taxpayers' pocket," Councilman Scott Montgomery said Thursday. He also 
criticized the lack of information presented to the council. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no written documentation, no nothing," he said. "We certainly need 
more meat on the bones." 
</P>
<P>
Time is running out for the City Council to take the steps to place the 
ambulance station issue before voters on Nov. 6. The measure must be filed with 
the Ventura County registrar by July 25. But before that, the city is required 
to hold public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to hold a special meeting next Wednesday to review financing 
plans for an ambulance station. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to reject any other alternatives at this time," said Mayor 
Bernardo Perez. He suggested that there may be other ways to raise money for a 
new ambulance station without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Harper for months have criticized the Ventura County Emergency 
Medical Services Agency, which oversees the network of ambulances and emergency 
medical care in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The two officials say the agency has allowed one private ambulance operator to 
respond to accident scenes and sick patients from a station outside Moorpark on 
Olsen Road. The location, they say, is too far away for timely responses to 
critically injured or deathly ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Harper said they want a station located within the city, despite a 
promise by the ambulance operator on Wednesday to trim the average response 
time to emergency calls from 15 to 10 minutes. PSYCHE PASCUAL

MAYOR REVEALS PATCHWORK PLAN TO BALANCE THE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, during an unusual City Council workshop session 
Thursday, outlined a series of fee increases, new fees and one-time payments 
that, if adopted by the full council, would balance the city's estimated 
$40-million budget shortage. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's proposed $40-million revenue package was pieced together with help 
from Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, the only other council member still 
remaining in council chambers at the end of Thursday's lengthy budget workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"This (package) shows that you can balance the budget" without increasing taxes 
that have not been previously approved by the voters, O'Connor said after 
Thursday's lengthy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Thursday night, however, if a majority of council members would 
accept the makeshift revenue package that is designed to balance the city's 
$460-million general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's proposed new revenue sources included several items that seem 
likely to win support when the council discusses new revenue during next 
Thursday's budget session. Council members have indicated that they hope to 
have a balanced budget in place by the end of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's suggested revenue package includes an estimated $6 million generated 
by increasing the business license fee. O'Connor also directed City Hall staff 
members to find an additional $6 million through a series of increases that 
would affect an unspecified number of existing city fees. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also is counting upon $3 million from a previously untapped water and 
sewer department fund that city officials now believe can be used to pay 
litigation costs generated by the city's continuing attempt to halt San Diego 
Gas &amp; Electric's proposed merger with Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposed revenue package also includes at least one highly speculative 
item, a $13-million payment from the San Diego Unified Port District. Although 
the Port District has agreed to pay the city for police and maintenance 
services provided on port property, commissioners won't determine the payment 
total until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of O'Connor's proposed revenue package would come from a variety of 
sources, including increased planning department fees, a delay in capital 
improvement projects at Balboa Park and a reduction in revenue used to fund 
special promotions, 
</P>
<P>
Some of O'Connor's proposed revenue increases mirrored recommendations made 
earlier in the day by two private-sector groups. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego County 
Taxpayers Assn. recommended that the council increase license fees paid by 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
However, unlike O'Connor, the two groups recommended that the city reconsider a 
$20-million property tax increase that would be used to fund the employee 
retirement fund. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the $20-million property tax in January by a 5-4 majority, 
but members subsequently reversed field and dropped consideration of increasing 
property taxes by $44 per $100,000 of assessed valuation -- or $66 for an 
average $150,000 home. 
</P>
<P>
The council has the power to approve the additional property tax without a vote 
by the public, but O'Connor and other council members have remained steadfast 
against raising property taxes without placing the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Using property tax revenue for the employee retirement fund obligation would 
free up $20 million in the $456-million general fund, which pays for many basic 
municipal services, including public safety, recreation and the libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing the business license fees "is prudent and appropriate," chamber 
President Lee Grissom said during council's Thursday budget workshop session. 
</P>
<P>
Council members generally agree that a business license fee increase would 
occur. Still undecided, however, is how big that increase will be. However, 
O'Connor on Thursday suggested that the council might consider increasing the 
licenses that now cost $30 to as much as $125. 
</P>
<P>
The council hopes to use the increased business license fee revenue to pay for 
increased costs of a number of City Hall operations, including the treasurer's 
office and the auditor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the chamber and the taxpayer's group recommended several revenue 
increases, they also are urging council to cut to cut at least $10 million from 
existing programs. The taxpayer association also has suggested that the council 
drop the proposed $13-million housing trust fund, which is designed to make 
housing available to lower-income residents, according to taxpayer's 
association executive director Jim Ryan.

2 MEN PLEAD INNOCENT TO KIDNAPINGS AND RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men pleaded innocent Thursday to rape, kidnaping and other felony charges 
alleging they abducted three women from San Fernando Valley streets at gunpoint 
and raped them at a ranch in Acton. 
</P>
<P>
Paul James McDaniels, 23, of Canyon Country and Theodore Robert Conyers, 26, of 
Acton each were charged Thursday with five counts of rape, two counts of 
kidnaping, one count of attempted forcible rape while acting in concert and one 
count of sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels also was charged with a third count of kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
At an arraignment Thursday in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Commissioner Rebecca 
Omens-Rochman ordered both men held without bail and set a July 2 preliminary 
hearing date. 
</P>
<P>
On at least three occasions over the past eight months, police believe the men 
ordered lone women into a pickup and drove them to the ranch, where they raped 
or attempted to rape them. After the rapes, the men returned the victims to the 
area where they were picked up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims ranged in age from 12 to 31, investigators said. Court documents 
name three who were allegedly raped. 
</P>
<P>
But police believe there may be other victims who have not come forward. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent known abduction occurred June 8, according to the criminal 
complaint filed against the men. The other known assaults took place last Nov. 
30 and Oct. 13, the document states. 
</P>
<P>
Omens-Rochman on Thursday granted a defense request not to permit media 
photographers and television cameramen to take the men's photos, saying such 
exposure could taint witnesses' and victims' identification of the men in a 
lineup.

PALMDALE SCHOOLS TO AWARD BUS CONTRACT DESPITE DISPUTE OVER SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS SAY THEY STAND BEHIND THE DECISION ALTHOUGH ANOTHER 
DISTRICT CANCELED ITS CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Palmdale School District officials said Thursday that they still plan to award 
a multimillion-dollar contract to a private bus company, despite learning that 
it left hundreds of handicapped students stranded at home for weeks during a 
1988 contract dispute in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't have any different opinion of Durham Transportation than we 
had before," said Forrest McElroy, superintendent of the 11,800-student 
Palmdale district. "We think they're a good operator. We think they will do a 
fine job." 
</P>
<P>
McElroy's comments followed a Los Angeles Times story on Thursday that reported 
Durham's past problems in Orange County. Unaware of those problems, the 
Palmdale district's Board of Trustees voted Tuesday to hire Durham -- the 
nation's fifth largest school bus operator -- to transport virtually all of the 
district's 4,500 bus-riding students starting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is expected to earn Durham about $3.1 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy said he was not troubled by Durham having provided the Palmdale 
district with incorrect bid information that made it appear as though the 
company still had a contract with the Orange County Superintendent of Schools. 
The contract was canceled in mid-1989. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials took that action after Durham failed, starting in 
September, 1988, to provide enough buses to transport mentally handicapped 
children from their homes to schools. 
</P>
<P>
As many as half of the 800 children were left without bus service for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Durham executives have blamed Orange County school officials for not increasing 
their payments to cover higher operating costs. A top Orange County school 
official this week called Durham's actions "despicable and not very ethical." 
</P>
<P>
After talking Thursday with Orange County school officials, McElroy said he 
still stood behind Durham. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company, which operates about 1,900 buses in California, Washington 
and Texas, has received favorable reviews from other school districts.

A former Lawndale Little League coach has pleaded no contest to two counts of 
molesting two of his team members, ages 10 and 11, the Los Angeles County 
district attorney reported. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steese, 34, entered his plea Wednesday in Torrance Superior Court and 
will be sentenced July 27, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Geltz. Steese 
faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Geltz said the molestation incidents occurred last December and in April at a

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGHLAND HIGH TO GO YEAR-ROUND IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Antelope Valley Union High School District will follow the course of a 
growing number of year-round elementary schools by placing its first high 
school on a similar schedule, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Highland High School, one of five campuses in the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District, will convert to the year-round schedule in July, 1991, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The school, now in bungalows, is scheduled to move into permanent facilities 
about that time. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the 9,800-student district said they hope the year-round schedule 
will improve learning for students, reduce overcrowding in the district and 
keep the district eligible for state school construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
The district's Board of Trustees decided Wednesday night that Highland will 
operate on a rotating four-track calendar, with three of the student tracks on 
campus at a time. Each student group will have three 60-day periods of classes 
interspersed with three 20-day vacation periods. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale School District, which started the Antelope Valley's first 
year-round elementary school last summer, plans to convert two more of its 18 
campuses this August. The neighboring Lancaster School District plans to make 
two of its 14 schools year-round this fall.

HARDEMAN DENIED FEES' REIMBURSEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has turned down Inglewood City Councilman 
Garland Hardeman's attempt to collect $230,000 in attorney's fees from the city 
and former opponent Ervin (Tony) Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman and Thomas fought a bitter two-year court battle after Thomas narrowly 
edged out Hardeman in the 1987 City Council election. Hardeman charged Thomas 
and his political allies with voter fraud and eventually defeated Thomas in a 
court-ordered runoff election last October for the District 4 council seat. 
</P>
<P>
The court in September approved $7,300 for Hardeman to cover court costs such 
as photocopying and filing fees. In a separate action, Judge Barnet Cooperman 
on May 8 rejected an attempt by Hardeman to recover the cost of attorney's 
fees.

DISABLED FIND A PATHWAY BEYOND THEIR BLINDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA FARRINGTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joann Seaman, 41, received her fine arts degree in 1972. A few months ago, she 
mastered the task of folding a sheet at the Center for Living Independence for 
the Multi-Handicapped Blind (CLIMB) in Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
"I did well in school, but I couldn't do anything or go anywhere on my own," 
said Seaman, who is blind, with slight brain damage that has not impaired her 
academic aptitude but has left her unable to perform household tasks. "If I 
hadn't come here (to CLIMB), I would have still needed someone to take care of 
me all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Nestled among quaint small-town shops on Sierra Madre Boulevard, CLIMB is 
believed to be the only facility in the San Gabriel Valley where basic living, 
communication and vocational skills are taught to adult blind people with 
developmental disabilities. Only one other program in the county, Therapeutic 
Living Centers for the Blind in Reseda, offers similar residential care, said 
Judy Poindexter, director of the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center, which 
coordinates services for the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The two programs serve about 140 adults in Los Angeles County, which, according 
to state figures, has 1,378 adults who are blind and developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"These are just the people who are registered with us; heaven knows how many 
others are out there that we don't know about," said Roberta Marlowe of the 
state Department of Developmental Services. 
</P>
<P>
Many of CLIMB's students, like Seaman, were premature babies born in the late 
1940s and early '50s who were placed in incubators and given too much oxygen. 
They later developed retrolental fibroplasia, which causes blindness and brain 
damage. The program's 94 residents vary in degree of disability. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter said there are schools for the blind and programs for the 
developmentally disabled, but little residential care for those with both 
problems. In addition, most programs are geared to those under the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
CLIMB, which opened in July, 1977, with 18 students, is filled and has a 
waiting list of 80. 
</P>
<P>
CLIMB executive director and founder Bill Young came up with the idea for the 
facility while working at the Foundation for the Junior Blind in Los Angeles. 
He noticed that foundation students sent home after age 21 "would regress. They 
would just sit around and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big problem," said David Ekin, program director at the Foundation 
for the Junior Blind. "When our students become adults, there is no place for 
them to go. Many go back home, and the parents don't know what to do."

LARRY KING GOES TO BAT FOR BABE RUTH MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All shapes and sizes of organizations have tried to recruit Larry King, one of 
the most distinctive voices in America, with the hope he might agree to stand 
up and offer an appeal for this or that cause. But it's not his game. He didn't 
want to be linked with fund-raising, or putting one charity ahead of another. 
So he declined, ever so politely. 
</P>
<P>
He has an imposing stature in the field of broadcasting and, in fact, has 
earned a presence for himself that rivals such luminaries of the past as Arthur 
Godfrey, Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan. There's an ethical awareness that 
prevents him from using his network platform to solicit contributions. 
</P>
<P>
But then along came the Babe Ruth Museum, located in Baltimore, and it asked 
King if he would become national chairman of its membership committee. His 
answer was a ringing acceptance and endorsement of a new campaign that will 
extend the facility's physical dimensions via an extensive expansion effort. 
</P>
<P>
King will be the point man, the personality who is out front selling the idea 
to individuals and corporations all across the nation. "The name Babe Ruth 
catches everyone's attention," he said. "The Babe was symbolic of baseball. He 
was and is baseball." 
</P>
<P>
A historian of a sport he enjoys and understands, King knows Ruth towers above 
all players, past and present, in talent and a sense of the dramatic. King 
never saw Ruth play and wasn't old enough the one year, 1939, when he served as 
a first-base coach for the Brooklyn Dodgers and took batting practice, which 
was a cheap grandstand ploy to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I was in Ebbets Field and heard his farewell speech (April 27, 1947) 
when baseball celebrated Babe Ruth Day all over America. The comments Ruth made 
in Yankee Stadium about what baseball represented to the boys of our country 
and the other things he had to say, with a voice weakened by cancer, were 
pumped into Ebbets Field and to all other ballparks." 
</P>
<P>
What Ruth had to say and how he struggled against the pain to speak in not much 
more than whisper so impressed King that he hasn't forgotten the tugging 
emotion of the moment. "No doubt, he was America's greatest athlete, born and 
raised in Baltimore and, in fact, as a child lived on the exact location where 
center field is going to be located in the new ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of a stadium name, King reiterated his position. "It should be 
Babe Ruth Park," he emphasized. "To ignore Ruth's ties to Baltimore amid so 
much rich background would be some sort of craziness to me. Imagine the 
marketing value of the name. Without Baltimore, plus the Orioles signing him, 
the world never would have heard of him." 
</P>
<P>
And if you want a little-known note about Ruth, listen as King provides it. 
"With all of Ruth's hitting attainments, don't forget he won 94 games as a 
pitcher. And do you realize that in winning percentage against the New York 
Yankees, he stands second in percentage. When he was with the Boston Red Sox, 
he beat the Yanks 17 times and lost only five." 
</P>
<P>
King has long been a Baltimore booster. He was raised in Brooklyn, worked in 
Miami and is now based in Washington. But if he has adopted a city by 
acclamation it would have to be Baltimore. That's because two of his broadcast 
friends, the late Bill O'Donnell and Joe Croghan, continually talked of its 
place in history and what it represented. 
</P>
<P>
So King was impressed. The Orioles draw his personal attention as no other team 
in sports. King is a student of the game, knows its Hall of Fame heroes as well 
as the utility journeymen and talks with in-depth knowledge of the character 
and nuances of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the unprecedented achievement of the Orioles winning seven 
straight pennants in the International League, a dynasty that stands alone in 
the record book. And then he pointed out that Al Kaline, a Baltimore-born Hall 
of Famer, lived only five minutes away from where Ruth was born, the site of 
the museum at 216 Emory St. 
</P>
<P>
More than 28,000 men, women and children visited the "House of Ruth" last year 
and the total should continue to climb. It's the largest baseball museum in the 
country -- next to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. -- and features 
exhibits that pay tribute to Ruth, to the Orioles and to other distinguished 
Maryland players. 
</P>
<P>
King wants to send out a message to stimulate more interest in the United 
States and Canada among fans, with the enthusiastic expectation they will want 
to go to bat for Ruth, in a manner of speaking and, in turn, enable the museum 
to enlarge. The Babe would've liked that.

WORLD CUP: VICTORY OVER UNDERDOG EGYPT WINS GROUP F. IRELAND AND NETHERLANDS 
ALSO ADVANCE. ONE IS DEAD IN A BUS CRASH, BUT HOOLIGANS ARE NOT AT FAULT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second-half goal carried England past Egypt, 1-0, and into the second round 
of the World Cup Thursday at the head of a tightly bunched, goal-stingy group 
of teams afflicted with draw fever on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
In the other Group F game, in Palermo, Ireland rallied for a 1-1 tie with the 
Netherlands. It was enough to advance both teams, and, with the help of a 
tiebreaking lottery, completed second-round pairings. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, about 3,000 no-nonsense Italian police flooded Cagliari streets, 
and once again they overwhelmed English soccer hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
There were no major hooligan incidents, but the Cagliari finale was marred by a 
crash in a bus caravan north of the city. Three of six buses carrying English 
fans to the game, under police escort, collided. Police reported one dead and 
24 others, including the Italian bus driver, injured. Four remained 
hospitalized early today. 
</P>
<P>
England's victory was the only one of six Group F games played in Sicily and 
Sardinia over the past 10 days that did not end in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
In Palermo Thursday night, Ruud Gullit scored an early goal for the 
Netherlands, but underdog Ireland battled back for a second-half equalizer from 
Niall Quinn, leaving Ireland and the Netherlands tied for second in the 
tournament's tightest group. Ireland was placed second in a lottery in Rome, 
which put it in a better second-round position. Ireland opens the second round 
against Romania. 
</P>
<P>
As the third-place team, the Netherlands drew the unenviable lot of opening the 
second round against tough West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Cagliari, England spoiled a stubborn Egyptian defense 12 minutes into the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
English midfielder Paul Gascoigne, the best player on the field in this game, 
lofted a free kick into the air from about 30 yards out to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Rising high above the pack, defender Mark Wright grazed the ball, deflecting it 
into the net past diving goalie Ahmed Shobeir. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, English Coach Bobby Robson heaped praise on the Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very brave," Robson said. "It was never easy." 
</P>
<P>
Battling desperately for a tie, Egypt, cheered on by hundreds of Egyptian naval 
cadets in dress whites and most of the Italian majority in the stadium, fought 
back with unflagging resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt came closest 20 minutes into the final period on a sharp exchange ending 
with a close-in shot from the right by Hossam Hassan. English goalie Peter 
Shilton smothered it with difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the game, England had nine defenders ranged in front of its net 
to hold off Egyptian attacks. In all, Egypt outshot England, 9-8, although most 
of those shots were from long distance. 
</P>
<P>
England dominated the first half, playing well in the midfield and forcing 
passing mistakes by the smaller, less-experienced Egyptians without gaining 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, England repeatedly displayed an absence of ideas, forcing cluttered 
scrambles in front of the goal, but no good chances. Gascoigne attacked 
strongly but futilely for the English in a first half during which there were 
only three shots by each team and one save apiece by the opposing goal keepers. 
</P>
<P>
Shilton made his save on Egypt's best hope, a long bullet to the corner by 
Magdi Abdelghani late in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a plucky team of mostly part-timers, had not been given a prayer in its 
first Cup appearance since 1934. But the team had plenty of prayers, anyway. 
The Egyptian coach, a former army colonel and a fitness fanatic, took his 
players on pilgrimage to Mecca before the tournament began. And in a game 
earlier this week, when time came for a crucial Egyptian penalty kick against 
Ireland, the TV commentator heard in Cairo urged viewers to pray to Allah. The 
kick was good and Egypt earned its second tie in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Robson, England's captain, also sought outside help. Before Thursday's 
game, he summoned faith healer Olga Stringfellow, 70, from Surrey to treat his 
aching Achilles' tendon. Apparently something went wrong, because Robson didn't 
play Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Supplementing a day-of-game ban on the sale of alcohol, Italian authorities 
also banned a march to the stadium by English fans of the sort that brought 
violence before Saturday's game against the Netherlands. It worked. The English 
fans arrived in small and orderly groups. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the British Embassy here estimated that about 5,000 English fans, 
a relative handful of hooligans among them, had remained in Sardinia for the 
Egypt game. 
</P>
<P>
On the mainland, precautions were already being taken for England's 
second-round game Tuesday against Belgium in Bologna. Lord Ferrers, the 
minister of state in charge of police, promised in London Thursday that there 
would be a "rapid deployment" of Italian security forces and anti-hooligan 
British police specialists working with them. 
</P>
<P>
With its part in the World Cup ended, none in Sardinia will lament the passing 
of the tattooed, beer-bellied, usually intoxicated English followers. 
</P>
<P>
"Disappointing," one Sardinian newspaper termed the Cup Thursday, complaining 
about the quality of soccer and the interruption of daily life on an 
agriculture-tourism island that has been under police siege for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But if Sardinia will cheerfully watch the rest of it on television, the Cup did 
did bring benefits to this relatively poor part of Italy. Major improvements, 
including a modernized Cagliari airport, new access highways, an improved 
Sant'Elia stadium, and 21st Century telecommunications, will serve Sardinia 
long after the last broken beer stein has been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, hooligan violence, quashed by the massive show of Italian 
force, could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy reported 72 arrests of English fans, mostly for drunkenness 
and vandalism. In an 1,800-game English soccer season, British police make 
about 6,000 hooligan arrests, the Embassy noted. 
</P>
<P>
In Olbia on Tuesday night, drunken English fans clashed in a fist- and 
bottle-throwing brawl with Italians celebrating Italy's third-game victory over 
Czechoslovakia. Police arrested 23 Englishmen and one Italian. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a Sardinian judge, noting it strange that a free-for-all should 
produce a 23-1 arrest disparity, threw out all charges. 
</P>
<P>
One group of anti-hooligan English fans, complaining that all Englishmen on the 
island were being tarred with the same brush, organized blood donations as a 
gesture of thanks to Sardinia. About 30 fans donated to help in the treatment 
of thalassaemia, a blood disorder.

NO-BLACKS POLICY AT PGA SITE; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: TOURNAMENT DRAWS CONTROVERSY WHEN BIRMINGHAM, ALA., COUNCILMAN PROTESTS 
MEMBERSHIP AT SHOAL CREEK COUNTRY CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a public relations nightmare, the Professional Golfers' Assn. of 
America moved quickly Thursday to distance itself from a growing racial 
controversy at Shoal Creek Country Club, site of the 1990 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in the last six years, the prestigious tournament -- one of 
four major golf events -- returns to the Shoal Creek course, near Birmingham, 
Ala. This time, however, questions have been raised concerning the club's 
longstanding refusal to allow blacks as members. Caught in the middle of the 
debate is the PGA, which selected Shoal Creek as the host of the Aug. 9-12 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way does the PGA condone discrimination," said Andy O'Brien, PGA 
director of media relations. "When we made the decision in 1984 to come back in 
1990, there were no discrimination issues (raised) at the time." 
</P>
<P>
There are now. William Bell, a Birmingham city councilman, has protested the 
use of city funds to help pay for an advertisement in the tournament program. 
According to Bell, a 10-year-old resolution prohibits the city from financially 
supporting an event where formal or de facto discrimination occurs. 
</P>
<P>
That advertisement was authorized by Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington, who is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give any more national exposure to this than is already out 
there," Bell said. "You should talk with Shoal Creek. They're the ones who have 
put in an unwritten policy that won't allow (blacks) as members or even out 
there as guests. This is one organization headed up by one man who has an 
antiquated view." 
</P>
<P>
Bell referred to Hall Thompson, the founder of Shoal Creek. Thompson told 
reporters Wednesday that blacks weren't allowed at the country club because 
"that's just not done in Birmingham," adding, in an Associated Press story: 
</P>
<P>
"Bringing up this issue will just polarize the community. . . . But it can't 
pressure us. The country club is our home, and we pick and choose who we want." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is rather unsettling to the PGA, which would prefer to worry about 
pin placements instead of public outrage. According to O'Brien, the PGA is an 
innocent bystander, unaware until now of discriminatory practices by Shoal 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a Shoal Creek problem than a PGA problem," he said. "We can't 
control what the club does 50 weeks a year. We control what happens there for 
two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Rielly, president of the PGA and head professional at Pasadena's Annandale 
Golf Club, could not be reached for comment Thursday. He told the Associated 
Press Wednesday that Shoal Creek's membership decisions have become an issue 
"in the last two years." He added that the PGA is helpless when the 
discrimination is instituted through unwritten rules, as is apparently the case 
at Shoal Creek. 
</P>
<P>
As current PGA policy reads, tournament sites are selected on the basis of 
operational advantages rather than specific membership policies. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the next four PGA Championship sites also has an unwritten 
discriminatory rule similar to that at Shoal Creek. And at least two of the 
other three clubs do not have a black on their membership rolls. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Aronimink Golf Club, near Philadelphia, site of the 1993 PGA 
Championship, said that no blacks are allowed to join. "There is no written 
policy," said the official, who is familiar with the membership of the club. 
"We do not have any blacks as members, and I don't think any have ever applied. 
It's rather understood that's not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both Crooked Stick Golf Club in Carmel, Ind., site of next year's 
PGA Championship, and Oak Tree Golf Club in Edmund, Okla., the host of the 1994 
event, said blacks are permitted to join their facilities. At this time, 
however, there are no black members of Crooked Stick or Oak Tree. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shoemaker, tournament chairman of Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis, 
site of the 1992 PGA Championship, declined to comment on his club's membership 
or rules. 
</P>
<P>
The Shoal Creek issue, as it relates to the city of Birmingham, probably will 
be resolved next Tuesday when the City Council meets. Bell said he wants 
Thompson or a representative of Shoal Creek to state for the record that blacks 
are welcome as members at the club. If not, he wants the city to withdraw its 
financial support for the program advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
As for the PGA, which is a separate entity from the PGA Tour, O'Brien said it 
will pay more attention to the membership policies of potential tournament 
sites. "Should this come up in the future, sure, it would be an issue," he 
said.

NO SETTLEMENT IN GATHERS SUITS; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: FAMILY ATTORNEY SEEKS VIDEOTAPE FROM ESPN TO SUPPORT CASE AND IS 
REFUSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In the two months since the family of Hank Gathers filed a $32.5-million suit 
charging negligence against 14 defendants, the 29 attorneys involved have not 
settled and are apparently headed to court. But a secondary issue dealing with 
First Amendment protection may land some of them in court as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the case will probably go all the way through trial, the facts 
(surrounding Gathers' death) will all come out," Gathers' family attorney Bruce 
Fagel said Thursday in a news conference he called at his Beverly Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
"On July 18 the answers (documents and questionnaires) are due from the 
defendants. . . . From that point on it is going to be a blood bath." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a Loyola Marymount basketball player, collapsed March 4 at Gersten 
Pavilion while playing in a West Coast Conference tournament game. He was 
pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. An 
autopsy determined he died from cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Burke Jr., an attorney for Loyola Marymount, one of the defendants, said 
that defense attorneys believed it was premature to reasonably evaluate the 
circumstances of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It is strongly headed for litigation in court," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
But an additional issue raised by the Gathers' suit could provoke a 
Constitutional battle between ESPN, which had at least one camera operator who 
allegedly videotaped Gathers' collapse and the subsequent events, and Fagel, 
who has subpoenaed the unedited tape from the network. Fagel says he needs the 
unedited tape to determine what kind of care Gathers received when he 
collapsed, as well as the elapsed time. 
</P>
<P>
"The stations that had cameras at Gersten Pavilion that night were KTLA, KCBS, 
KNBC and ESPN," Fagel said. "They will not turn over anything not already 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"ESPN is challenging our subpoena, and even if they lose, they say they will 
take it to the U.S. Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
C. Stephen Davis, an attorney for ESPN, said the network provided Fagel with a 
copy of the videotape that the network aired. But Davis cited the California 
Shield Law for not giving him the unedited tape, which protects any unpublished 
information obtained for communication to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to preserve our rights and those of any journalist under the 
Constitution," Davis said, adding that it's premature to predict the legal 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Fagel implied that sports is not entitled to the same Constitutional 
protection as other news," Davis said. "Well, what Fagel wants footage of is 
emergency efforts to revive a human being. That activity is not sports but the 
tragedy of a dying athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel filed suit April 20 on behalf of Gathers' mother, Lucille, brothers 
Derrick and Charles and an aunt, Carol Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
An additional suit -- for an unspecified amount -- was filed June 8 on behalf 
of Gathers' estate and Gathers' 6-year-old son, Aaron Crump, who lives with his 
mother, Marva Crump, in Philadelphia. It was filed by Philadelphia attorneys 
Martin Krimsky and Adrian Moody and Los Angeles attorney Ken Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
A motion to consolidate the suits will be heard July 6 in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
There are six law firms and about 25 attorneys involved in the representation 
of the 14 defendants, who include four Loyola Marymount employees and seven 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
C. Snyder Patin, an attorney for defendants Dr. Vernon Hattori and Hattori's 
company, Apex Cardiology, said expert testimony will be required to determine 
if anyone is responsible for Gathers' death, besides it being an "act of God." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to meet with Mr. Fagel if there are not going to be any 
(settlement) offers," Patin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason for meeting with him because my clients do not think they did 
anything that was below the standard of care that caused or contributed to the 
death of Hank Gathers in any manner. They have therefore refused to give their 
consent to any offer of settlement being made at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said that because both suits were filed on a legal "fast -track," the 
case should come to trial by next spring.

URUGUAY ADVANCES ON GOAL IN THE FINAL SECONDS

<P>
Daniel Fonseca made his World Cup debut a dramatic one and lifted Uruguay into 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old substitute headed in a long free kick by Alfonso Dominguez with 
only seconds to go for a 1-0 victory over South Korea at Udine, Italy, on 
Thursday. Uruguay had to win to advance for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up and thanked God," Fonseca said after giving Latin American teams a 
five-for-five record in qualifying for the second round this year. "My job when 
I was sent in was to score a goal and get Uruguay qualified. When I came on, I 
was determined to do my best and I succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay succeeded despite playing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very badly, but we obtained the result," Coach Oscar Tabarez said. 
"We failed in all major aspects -- in strategy, technique, tactics. Now we'll 
have to study the problems." 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Uruguay three points and third place in Group E, good enough to 
put it among the four best third-place teams. Uruguay, a major power and 
two-time champion, had gone winless in 11 World Cup games since reaching the 
semifinals in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayans struggled against the foul-prone South Koreans, twice hitting 
the post and never finding the target despite several easy chances. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca was sent on in the 62nd minute to replace star striker Ruben Sosa. He 
leaped over two Koreans to get his head on the winning goal, then ran into the 
arms of his teammates and team officials. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea committed 40 fouls to prevent the Uruguayans from getting into 
their stride. The tactic almost worked. 
</P>
<P>
Spain 2, Belgium 1 -- Spain was annoyed that it wasn't seeded ahead of Belgium 
in Group E at the World Cup. So the Spanish went out and proved their point 
Thursday with a victory at Verona. 
</P>
<P>
Spain broke through a makeshift Belgian defense for two first-half goals, on a 
penalty kick by Michel -- his tournament-leading fourth goal -- and on a header 
by Alberto Gorriz off Michel's free kick. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to offset midfielder Patrick Vervoort's free kick that sneaked 
through a gap in the Spanish wall in the 31st minute. 
</P>
<P>
It also was enough to give Spain first place in the group, setting up a meeting 
with Yugoslavia in the second round. Belgium wound up second. 
</P>
<P>
"I said we had a team that could beat Belgium," Spanish Coach Luis Suarez said. 
"We came out very relaxed and confident." 
</P>
<P>
Michel's goal broke open what had been a clean but dull match between two teams 
already qualified for the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Spain controlled the ball in the first half, but both teams had an equal number 
of scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium pressed hard for the entire second half and threw away a chance for a 
tie when Enzo Scifo banged a penalty shot off the crossbar in the 60th minute. 
A tie would have given Belgium first place. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish goalie Andoni Zubizarreta did the rest with his third outstanding 
performance of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Spain avenged a penalty-kick shootout loss to Belgium in the 1986 World Cup 
quarterfinals.

OTL LOOKS TO CROSS THE LINE, GO NATIONAL

<P>
Many people think of over-the-line as an out-of-control beach spectacle in 
mid-July, in which obscene names of teams and skimpy swimsuits are the 
attraction. The sidelight has been the game, which seemingly has consisted of 
overweight pseudo-athletes playing a simplified version of softball and home 
run derby. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Olson, Keith Mullin, DeRon Simon and Jordan Kitaen, who have been playing 
the sport for at least 10 years and have the bent fingers to show for it, know 
all about the public perceptions of OTL. But they see it in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
They still see it as a great spectator sport -- bikinis included -- but the 
four also envision OTL with in-shape, talented athletes competing for prize 
money, with television beaming the action around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sound like a fantasy? It's becoming reality. The Pro Beach Softball Assn. will 
present the Coors Light Over-The-Line Pro Series this weekend at Fiesta Island, 
the first stop of three planned for a pro circuit this year. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Olson, Mullin, Simon and Kitaen are planning a seven- to eight-month 
season with possible stops in Cleveland, Padre Island, Tex., Florida, Mexico, 
Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Will it fly? 
</P>
<P>
Simon, PBSA's secretary and the editor of OTL Magazine, said you need to look 
no further than Fresno to find the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 20,000 people in Fresno watching a two-man volleyball tournament 
last week," Simon said. "We think eventually we can do something similar." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the magazine, in its second year, and the Old Mission Bay Athletic 
Club's July event that gave the group the impetus to start a pro tour. The 
magazine's circulation has grown steadily and, according to Simon, is now at 
12,000. OMBAC's tournament now attracts more than 1,000 teams a year. 
</P>
<P>
Olson, president of the PBSA, said his sport might need more converts if it is 
to succeed nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there's a lot more softball players across the country playing 
softball than volleyball. We know there's a lot of people in the Midwest that 
play softball. If we can just get a small percentage of those people to start 
playing our game, we'll be doing fine." 
</P>
<P>
Glen Shumaker, who works for Crest Distributing, distributors of the sponsoring 
beer in San Diego, figures the sport will get more than its share of 
participation. "They really didn't have to convince me on the idea," said 
Shumaker, a two-time OTL world champion. "I've been playing the sport since 
1977. I think it's got great possibility. There are guys playing for top dollar 
on the beach. There's no reason over-the-line can't work. It's fun and there's 
some good athletes involved." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the beer sponsorship, the PBSA has also secured a brand of rum 
and Ryno Athletic Club, and Simon says there is a possibility of another 
well-known sponsor joining in the next month. 
</P>
<P>
But before the sport can achieve a large amount of commercial success, Shumaker 
and the PBSA agreed they would have to clean up OTL's image. 
</P>
<P>
"The party atmosphere that has gone on for so long had to stop," Shumaker said. 
"For television or for any kind of sponsorship, the names had to be cleaned up 
a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kitaen, vice president of the PBSA and publisher of the magazine: "I think 
the sport has an enormous amount of potential, but like anything for it to go 
to another level, we have to have the media." 
</P>
<P>
Kitaen said the PBSA has separated itself from OMBAC's tournament by shifting 
the focus from the spectacle to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We have developed the pro bracket to isolate the best competition," Kitaen 
said. "In OMBAC's tournament, amateur teams would go up against the best teams 
and get swamped. We have a more focused player pool for sponsors to look at. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see over-the-line more accessible to families. We'll still be 
appealing to young people, but we're getting away from the raunch." 
</P>
<P>
Simon said OTL's biggest draw is the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The game can be played by anybody," he said. "It doesn't take much equipment 
and there's a division for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The PBSA's tournaments will include divisions for juniors, men's masters (35 
and over), men's legends (45 and over), women's masters and a women's open. The 
top 32 teams will compete in the pro division, with a first prize of $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said his group is close to landing a television deal with Prime Ticket, 
which could give OTL instant name recognition. But Shumaker said he believes 
OTL might even need to make slight changes in the game for television. 
</P>
<P>
"The foul balls that have to be chased and brought back into play might take 
too long for TV," Shumaker said. "Maybe they could somehow have another ball 
ready for play or make it just one pitch instead of two per batter." 
</P>
<P>
The PBSA has already decided to make a minor revision in the game that was 
invented in San Diego by Ron LaPolice and Mike Curren in the 1950s. It has 
narrowed fair territory from 60 to 55 feet. 
</P>
<P>
After they coordinate tournaments, publish magazines and revise the rules, 
Simon, Olson, Kitaen and Mullin, the group's chief financial officer, also plan 
to play a little bit. All four play on teams that will compete in the pro 
division.

TRYING TO MOVE AHEAD, LONG WILL BACK UP; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: QUARTERBACK WILL CADDY FOR EVERETT IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESURRECT HIS 
ONCE-PROMISING CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Chuck Long, once a bright star in his own galaxy, is now destined to be 
outshone by a supernova, Jim Everett, as Long embarks on a second career at the 
Rams' new halfway house for quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
You think it's easy leaving your ego at the door when the hat-check man hails 
from Purdue? It's a price you pay for rehabilitation, and Long appears 
determined to pull his career back up from the bottom rung. 
</P>
<P>
Before his recent trade from Detroit for a draft choice, Long never imagined 
teaming with Everett. They weren't just college contemporaries, but heated Big 
Ten rivals -- Long at Iowa, Everett at Purdue. They weren't the best of 
friends, either. What they shared was a conference, the gifts of being a 
quarterback and a common time in football history. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Jim Everett on the same team?" Long was thinking a while back. "It'll 
never happen. But you never say never in this business. I don't think I'll have 
a problem with Jim. I don't think he'll have a problem with me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, they shared the same ambitions going into the National Football 
League. Though many pegged Everett all along as the better pro prospect, Long's 
collegiate career was more storied. Only Bo Jackson separated Long from the 
Heisman Trophy in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Both quarterbacks were first-round draft choices, Everett going first to 
Houston and Long to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
As Long says of his life, "A lot of it is timing." 
</P>
<P>
Everett refused to play for the Oilers and forced a trade to the Rams, who 
entrusted him to the tutelage of passing whiz Ernie Zampese. The rest is 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Long took his lumps as the lowly Lion starter, showing some promise at first. 
Then he watched as the team changed coaches, from Darryl Rogers to Wayne 
Fontes; and then offenses, from conventional pro-style to the unconventional 
run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-footed Long was a trot-and-shoot quarterback at best and had a history 
of arm problems. Long played in just seven games in 1988 and appeared only once 
last season after having had off-season surgery on his throwing elbow. He 
completed two passes in five attempts in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out of football for a year," Long said. "And I was out of football in a 
run-and-shoot offense. I was probably at the lowest level in my playing career. 
It's funny how I got to that point. Everything turned about 180 degrees for me 
in about a year-and-a-half span." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the odds against winning his job back from Rodney Peete this summer, 
Long was determined to do so. Then came his one-way ticket out of town, via the 
University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that all changed when they drafted (quarterback) Andre Ware," Long 
said of the Lions' first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Four years after being touted as Detroit's future, Long was suddenly Detroit's 
past. Still, given their stability at quarterback, Long was surprised when the 
Rams called. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he shouldn't have been. While the San Francisco 49ers had long ago 
taken out quarterback insurance with the acquisition of backup Steve Young, the 
Rams have waged war precariously with Everett, resigned to prayer that he 
remain standing at the end of each season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were looking for a scaled-down version, pay scale and otherwise, of 
the 49ers' Young and enlisted Long. 
</P>
<P>
Long and his ego had several discussions concerning his new duties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, not an easy thing, because I was once a starter in this league," 
he said. "It was something I had to come to terms with. You have to put the ego 
aside in some cases. " 
</P>
<P>
Long came to this realization: He could either have his spine rearranged by 
starting for another team such as the Lions, or he could try to put his game 
together from scratch with a winner under the guiding hand of Zampese. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into another situation like Detroit, where I go in, I 
start, I get banged around and struggle," Long explained. "Then all of a 
sudden, they're booing me by the end of the year and they're looking for other 
guys. That's not the type of thing I wanted to get into again." 
</P>
<P>
But can you teach an older quarterback new tricks? Ram Coach John Robinson 
thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Chuck we could put him back in an environment that suits him," 
Robinson said. "He's an accurate and precision passer, not a power passer. Our 
offense is perfectly suited for him. I think we'll bring the best out in him." 
</P>
<P>
And what becomes of current Ram backup Mark Herrmann? That depends on whether 
Robinson keeps two quarterbacks or three, a decision that hasn't been made. 
Robinson thinks of Herrmann as his short reliever, a competent quarterback who 
can get the Rams through a game if Everett goes down. If Everett is injured for 
an extended period, then Long would be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Long, in the meantime, hopes to re-establish himself with his peers and show 
the league that his arm is sound again after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that with time, in this system, I can re-establish myself in the NFL," 
Long said. "This is probably the best place for that. . . . The Rams never led 
me on in any way. I know exactly what I'm getting into. I never like to accept 
a backup role, but in this case I feel I can accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Long also envisions returning someday to center stage and reliving 
his rivalry with Everett. Because both quarterbacks are 27, though, Long knows 
his career won't be blossoming in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I'd want to leave, don't get me wrong," Long said. "If I play 
the rest of my career here, I'll be happy with that. But it is in the back of 
my mind that, maybe, something will happen down the line. But I'm not going to 
count on that."

MELVILLE PICKS UP PACE AT 70; 
</P>
<P>
TRIATHLETE: OJAI RESIDENT WARMS UP FOR 100-MILE RUN AND 100-MILE HORSEBACK RIDE 
WITH RECORD IN 50-MILE ROAD RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
John Melville's idea of a good time: At the end of this month, jog across the 
spine of the High Sierra in a 100-mile ultra-marathon called the Western States 
Run, and then, about a month later -- in a rare double -- ride the same trail 
and the same distance in the Tevis Cup, the granddaddy of cross-country horse 
races. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounded plausible to Melville, an accomplished triathlete who lives in 
Ojai, but the Western States 100 race committee balked. Melville isn't a kid 
anymore. Or even middle-aged. He's 70, at an age when even driving 100 miles 
can be detrimental to ligaments and tendons. Besides, nobody his age had ever 
entered the footrace, a tortuous trek from Squaw Valley to Auburn, Calif., with 
an ascent of 19,000 feet over several inclines. 
</P>
<P>
So Melville was told that he would have to qualify by finishing a 50-mile race 
in less than 10 hours. That alone seemed like an impossible task. Melville had 
never even finished a 26.2-mile marathon in less than five hours. Even in 
training for the Ironman triathlon in Hawaii -- Melville has competed in the 
past seven -- he seldom runs more than 20 miles a day and he keeps his weekly 
mileage under 70, a low figure for endurance running. 
</P>
<P>
But Melville was blissfully unaware of just how tough it would be to crack 10 
hours in the 50-mile run: Nobody in his 70-74 age group had ever broken the 
10-hour barrier. So Melville would have to become the Roger Bannister of 
septuagenarians to qualify for the Western States Run. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily for him, he didn't know that," said his wife, Wilma Dasche-Melville. 
</P>
<P>
Melville competed in the West Coast 50 road run last month in Fountain Valley. 
Accompanying him was his physician and trainer, Dr. Jeff Herten of San Luis 
Obispo. Melville did cross-training -- swimming and cycling when he wasn't 
running -- and upper-body weightlifting. Every other day, he'd run between six 
and 10 miles. One day a week he'd go 20 miles. Herten made sure that Melville 
did five miles of vertical running each week and also made him practice eating 
and drinking on the run. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 25 miles around the five-mile loop in Fountain Valley, fortified 
by tubes of tapioca pudding concocted by Herten, Melville was 14 minutes ahead 
of the 10-hour pace and felt he was "really cooking." But then his body began 
to ache. At 36 miles, a dreadful reality suddenly overtook him, and he thought, 
he said, "I still have half a marathon to do." 
</P>
<P>
But Herten talked him out of quitting. "Jeff said, 'Everything that is going to 
hurt is already hurting and is not going to get worse,' " recalled Melville, 
who finished in 9 hours 56 minutes 38 seconds. "That was on a Saturday," he 
said. "On Tuesday I get a call saying I set a national record. I was too much 
of a gentleman to ask what the world record is." 
</P>
<P>
(According to The Athletics Congress, Melville broke the national age-group 
record by nearly eight minutes and might have set a world record but TAC 
doesn't list world standards for the event.) 
</P>
<P>
Melville currently is in Squaw Valley training for next Saturday's Western 
States Run, which will kick off an event-filled summer for him. A couple of 
weeks before the Aug. 4 Tevis Cup -- just for fun -- he is going to take part 
in a 40-mile ride-and-tie, a race in which the rider and his partner alternate 
riding a horse and jogging. Then, on Oct. 6, Melville will compete in another 
Ironman in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an amazing man, absolutely amazing," said Herten, who met Melville in 
1987 while taking part in a ride-and-tie. "He's an outstanding athlete and also 
has an exceptional mental attitude." 
</P>
<P>
John and Wilma Melville's 1 1/2-acre Ojai ranch is tucked away in a grove of 
eucalyptus trees at the base of the Topa Topa Mountains. It is an idyllic 
setting for a retired couple to while away the golden years, but the Melvilles 
are too busy to even smell the orange blossoms wafting over from a nearby 
grove. 
</P>
<P>
A horsewoman who competes in the Tevis Cup and other long-distance horse races, 
Wilma, 56, runs the ranch, which includes the care and feeding of three horses, 
two llamas, two dogs and a cat. She also conditions her horses for endurance 
races, taking them on long rides into the mountains behind her house. 
</P>
<P>
John mostly trains himself, jogging, cycling and swimming, and he goes to the 
local chiropractor for massages. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always wanted to lead a rural and animal-related life, and when I finally 
got a horse a few years ago, I told John I'd be spending four or five hours a 
day with it," Wilma said. We'd always done things together -- skied, built and 
flown our own airplane -- and he said, 'Well, I think I better find something 
to do (on my own).' " 
</P>
<P>
Before then, John was an avid hiker -- he met Wilma on a hike -- and has hiked 
all stretches of the 214-mile John Muir Trail. An engineer and real estate 
investor, Melville retired in the mid-1970s. A "kinky back" had kept him from 
being overly active, but the back mysteriously "clicked in" sometime in the 
late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, John was vacationing in Hawaii when he read about the Ironman 
competition taking place on the island of Kona. He flew there to watch it, 
immediately convinced that he could take up the triathlon at the advanced age 
of 62. He was intrigued by an event that combined running a marathon, swimming 
2.4 miles in the ocean and cycling 112 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not have done it if there was only one event," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Melville began training when he returned home, running 10Ks as well as a 
marathon before entering the 1983 Ironman. He has been remarkably consistent in 
the Ironman, recording a time of 16 hours 8 minutes in '83 and again last year. 
His best finish was 14:48 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"To succeed, you have to have an ability to make a commitment," said Wilma, a 
former physical-education teacher. "John has always been a very definite 
person, sure of what he wants to do. Rain or shine, problems or not, he gets 
out there and does what he has to do. He's also been very fortunate not to have 
any significant injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success, Melville is low key and self-effacing. Posters from 
several competitions hang not in a conspicuous place of honor but in his 
bathroom. He formed a club in L.A. for Ironman alumni older than 60, and their 
motto, he said, is omnius gloria fugit, all glory is fleeting. In other words, 
he says, "Don't get so involved with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
A sign by Melville's swimming pool -- "Pain is inevitable; suffering, optional" 
-- was given to him by Herten. It is indicative of Melville's willingness to 
work hard to maintain a youthful, vigorous body and a dynamic lifestyle. But 
how long can he keep one step ahead of Father Time? "A 91-year-old man ran in 
the New York Marathon this year," Herten said. "I'm not sure we really know 
what our limits are." 
</P>
<P>
For most of his life, Melville wasn't much of a swimmer or a jogger, but 
there's no doubt that he has grown faster with age. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nothing like I was 10 or 15 years ago," he said. "My energy level is 
higher. . . . I can jump in the pool and swim for two hours. It's really a 
kick." 
</P>

WOLF LEAVES RAIDERS FOR JETS' JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Wolf, the Raiders' director of player personnel, has accepted a similar job 
with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a tremendous opportunity to go to work for a vibrant 
organization," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
"But leaving the Raiders after all these years was a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, 51, a native of New Freedom, Pa., said being able to relocate to the East 
was also a factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf started with the Raiders as a talent scout in 1963 when Al Davis took over 
as coach and general manager. When Davis became commissioner of the American 
Football League in 1966, Wolf accompanied him to the league office as 
coordinator of talent. But he soon returned to the Raiders as the director of 
player personnel, and has held that job since, except for three years, 1975-78, 
with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

HEAT'S ON COACH TO PICK GOALIE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: BOBBY SIBBALD MUST DECIDE BETWEEN VETERAN MARINE CANO AND FORMER EL 
CAMINO ALL-AMERICAN MIKE LITTMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Bobby Sibbald has a big decision to make: Who to start in goal Saturday 
night when the Los Angeles Heat plays host to first-place Real Santa Barbara in 
an American Professional Soccer League West showdown at West Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Will the first-year Heat coach start the self-proclaimed "Dr. Parallel," 
35-year-old veteran Marine Cano? Cano, who is also the soccer coach at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, started in his first game and played a major role in 
helping the Heat snap a three-game losing streak at Portland last week. 
</P>
<P>
Or will Sibbald decide to start the man teammates call "Psycho," former El 
Camino College All-American Mike Littman. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made my mind up yet," Sibbald said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Sibbald is considering a lineup change for the 7:30 p.m. kickoff 
is nothing new. He has yet to start the same 11 players in consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"Change is like every other thing," Sibbald said. "Whatever works." 
</P>
<P>
Littman has started nine of 10 Heat games. He has three shutouts and was named 
most valuable player in two of those. He has allowed only 13 goals, second in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, host Seattle defeated the Heat, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The next night in Portland, Cano was in goal. The Heat trailed, 2-0, but 
rallied for a 4-3 penalty-kick victory. 
</P>
<P>
Littman admitted that the switch did the team good, but added: "(Sibbald) is 
the coach. I want to start. I have to live with his decision, but he has a 
tough one to make against Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
The hint of a goal change has added another wrinkle to the APSL's first big 
game of the season. Both teams have reached the midway point in the season and 
Santa Barbara (6-2) leads the Southern Division of the APSL by only four points 
over the Heat (5-5). 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important game," Sibbald said. "On paper we have the best team in 
the league, We just haven't put it all together yet." 
</P>
<P>
A goalie's style of play can bring a team together. Cano is more at home in the 
box, preferring to protect the goal with diving, twisting blocks. He admits his 
age limits some of his mobility, but said his experience as a player helps his 
positioning against attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Littman, 21, takes more chances, although he has been criticized by Heat 
management for straying too far from the net when the ball is in front of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Said El Camino College Coach Norm Jackson, who coached Littman for two seasons: 
"The game is changing. Goalies are playing more like sweepers. Mike has to be 
careful with that. He has to have quick feet." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald called Littman "the team's No. 1 goalie," and refused to blame the 
young stopper for the Heat's disappointing start. Sibbald became concerned with 
Littman's concentration during a losing streak when opponents scored eight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"The goals that were going in weren't necessarily his fault," Sibbald said. 
"They were the team's fault. Soccer isn't like hockey, where the goalie takes 
the blame for everything that goes in. Soccer is a team game. I just thought a 
change (in Portland) would do him good." 
</P>
<P>
Littman said a breakdown in communication betweem himself and teammates helped 
fuel the losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have a mental lapse for that split second," he said. "The guys are 
playing so hard and then it comes." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald thought Cano controlled the Portland game by directing players with 
constant chatter. 
</P>
<P>
"We turned the season around . . . The players got confident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Cano and Littman have faced off. Littman played 
goalie for Cal State Northridge in 1988 when Cano's undermanned Dominguez Hills 
team upset the host Matadors, 2-0. The victory helped the Toros tie for the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. They have also played against each 
other in club games and rumors developed that a feud existed between the two 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The goalies deny the rumors. Earlier this week, when Cano scheduled an informal 
workout for himself and a few Heat teammates at Dominguez Hills, Littman asked 
if he could join them. Cano was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
Said Littman: "We have a special type of relationship. He pulls for me and I 
pull for him. You don't find that with goalkeepers on other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Cano is a wise man. I can learn from him. He knows what he is talking about 
and I plan to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Cano, a spirited competitor, sees Littman starting in the future, but not 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a healthy rivalry," he said. "If he's playing, I will support him. When 
I'm playing, I want him to support me." 
</P>
<P>
The players met at Cano's youth goaltending camp at Dominguez Hills when 
Littman was 15. Littman got the nickname "Psycho" because, "I was always 
looking for a way to get hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slowed by injuries to his right ankle and knee, Littman gave up his senior year 
at Northridge and signed with the Heat. He has made some spectacular stops, 
including a game-saving block of a penalty kick in a 2-1 victory over Portland 
June 2. He has been criticized, however, for being too tough on himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought that if you feel you are perfect, you are finished," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Littman is "the best kid around," according to Cano. "He is mature, he is 
organized and he trains well." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat signed Cano, who has played professionally in England and the United 
States, in late April after the season began. Club management originally sought 
David Vanole of Hermosa Beach, but Vanole signed as the backup goalie for the 
U.S. World Cup team. Cano's only previous action this season has been playing a 
half of an exhibition game against an English traveling team in May. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who has changed little in the past seven years, according to Littman, 
isn't afraid to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a lot of fun. The guy has a lot of talent, a great heart and he's still 
a madman," Littman said. "It's funny, he's 35 years old and still young in his 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
It has taken Cano longer than he thought it would to get back into playing 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three goals," he said. "Get better each day, be durable and be in 
shape. I'm also here to help the Heat and whatever I can do for Mike, I will 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was a tip from Cano that helped Littman make the game-winning 
save against Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen Portland play and I noticed that this one player went for a certain 
corner of the net," Cano said. "I didn't want to get in Mike's face, but I told 
him what I had seen."

Howard Spira's arraignment on charges of trying to extort money from New York 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was postponed to July 5. 
</P>
<P>
Spira was indicted in Tampa, Fla., on March 23, but the case was moved to New 
York after his attorney, David Greenfield, complained that Steinbrenner would 
have an unfair advantage in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Spira, 30, appeared with Greenfield in Manhattan Federal Court for the brief 
hearing before U.S. Magistrate Michael Dolinger. Afterward, Greenfield said 
Spira will plead not guilty to the charges and that the case will go to trial, 
possibly later this year or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner originally said he paid Spira $40,000 "out of the goodness of my 
heart." Later, he claimed he gave Spira the money to stop him from disclosing 
embarrassing information about former Yankee employees. 
</P>
<P>
Spira said he was paid to collect damaging information on outfielder Dave 
Winfield, who had a longtime feud with Steinbrenner. The Yankees traded 
Winfield to the Angels last month.

Bjorn Borg's elegant seaside home in Stockholm will be seized and sold at 
auction if he doesn't pay a $1.1-million debt owed by his former business 
partner, Lars Skarke, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bailiffs visited Borg's home in a Stockholm suburb to assess its value. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not let in because nobody was home," said Bjorn Edgren, a senior 
court official. 
</P>
<P>
Borg was given an extension until July 20 to pay the debt. "Then we can use a 
locksmith," Edgren said. 
</P>
<P>
The debt owed by Skarke was personally guaranteed by the former tennis star. 
Skarke was managing director of Borg's clothing company, which collapsed last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, said the debt payment was being arranged from 
Italy but has been delayed. He said Borg planned legal action against Skarke 
aimed at getting the money back. 
</P>
<P>
Borg also is negotiating with creditors of his failed company to pay off 
millions of dollars in outstanding debts. 
</P>
<P>
Borg reportedly is in Italy to watch World Cup soccer action with his Italian 
wife, Loredana.

VENTURA COUNTY ALL-STARS TO VIE IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Bednar does not need a chalkboard when dissecting the Ventura County 
Basketball Coaches Assn. boys' all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
Bednar, the coach at Moorpark High who will lead the South squad, simply says 
that the team with the most talent will win tonight's contest, which features 
graduating seniors from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"That's usually the case because you're not going to throw anything like a 
press or something that will offset the talent," Bednar said. "You really can't 
work on the team concept." 
</P>
<P>
The boys' game will immediately follow the girls' 6:30 p.m. game at Ventura 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will have had only five practice days to prepare for the game. The 
North leads the series, 8-5, and Bednar places the favorite's mantle squarely 
on the shoulders of the North team. 
</P>
<P>
The North will be led by Shon Tarver of Santa Clara, a 6-foot-5 guard who 
averaged more than 30 points in leading the Saints to their second consecutive 
state Division IV championship. He will be joined by Jeff Oliver, a 5-11 guard 
from Buena who averaged nearly 30 points, and Eric Thomas, a 6-6 post player 
who will play at New Mexico in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Myers, Royal's all-time leading scorer who averaged 28 points last 
year, will be counted on heavily by the South. 
</P>
<P>
The South girls will be led by Nichole Victoria, The Times' county player of 
the year who averaged 22.8 points, and Melissa Gische of Westlake, a Times 
first-team all-county selection. 
</P>
<P>
In the North camp will be Hueneme's Edith Young, a point guard who averaged 13 
points, eight rebounds and six assists.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: USD'S MATTERA, BRILLE ALL-ACADEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
University of San Diego seniors Dan Mattera and Michael Brille were named 
third-team All-Academic Thursday by the Sports Information Directors of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Mattera, a four-year performer in men's tennis, graduated this spring with a

LOUISIANA-PACIFIC THREATENS PULLOUT FROM BAJA VENTURE 
</P>

Mired in a labor dispute with the Mexican government and unions, 
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. has suspended construction of its huge maquiladora 
plant near Ensenada and is threatening to pull out of the project altogether 
unless the dispute is settled to its liking. 
</P>
<P>
A Louisiana-Pacific spokesman confirmed reports published earlier this week in 
the Tijuana newspaper El Mexicano that the company has laid off more than 400 
construction employees. The workers were helping to build the first, 
200,000-square-foot phase of a redwood planing and drying facility on 80 acres 
that Louisiana-Pacific bought last year at El Sauzal, a few miles north of 
Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific called the construction halt on June 14 after it said the 
Mexican government reneged on a promise to let the company use its own 
employees to unload rough-cut timber from barges transporting redwood from the 
company's mills in Northern California. The government is now insisting that 
Louisiana-Pacific use longshoremen to unload the timber, the company says. 
Government officials were not available to respond to the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Using its own employees is cheaper than using unionized laborers and was one of 
the main reasons that Louisiana-Pacific decided to become the first U.S. lumber 
company to set up a large-scale maquiladora operation to Mexico, spokesman Shep 
Tucker said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the dispute is solved in the next two or three weeks, Louisiana-Pacific 
will "pull out" of its El Sauzal project altogether, Tucker said, despite 
already having spent $7.8 million for land, construction and improved port 
facilities at El Sauzal. 
</P>
<P>
Although leaving the door open to negotiations, Tucker said the suspension was 
"appropriate so as to clear up this important issue before more capital is 
invested." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Tijuana office of Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial 
Development, which approves maquiladora permits, were unavailable for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Portland-based Louisiana-Pacific, the nation's largest producer of redwood 
timber, announced the purchase of the El Sauzal site last year for the purpose 
of processing redwood to be shipped back across the border and sold mainly in 
Southern California. The first barge-load of rough-cut redwood timber arrived 
in February from Louisiana-Pacific mills in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific's decision to build the Baja California plant was viewed as 
part of a trend by which U.S. manufacturers would move heavy manufacturing 
operations to Mexico in addition to the light assembly work that has 
characterized most of the maquiladoras that have opened in Mexico so far. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ramirez, a vice president of Made in Mexico, a Chula Vista-based 
consultant who advises foreign manufacturers setting up plants in Mexico, said 
Louisiana-Pacific's problems are indicative of the "mine fields" some U.S. 
companies can encounter in Mexico if not sufficiently attuned to the political 
and cultural differences between the two countries.

COURT TO DECIDE TODAY ON RAPPAPORT ADMINISTRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When David Rappaport -- the 3-foot-11 actor who appeared in "L.A. Law" and the 
movie "Time Bandits" -- committed suicide last month, his family had no idea 
that the nightmare would drag on so long and that the aftermath would be so 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Rappaport died without leaving a will, and in the seven weeks since his death, 
a snag in California probate law has brought trouble ranging from the attempted 
eviction of his fiancee -- Eliza Lende -- from the Hollywood Hills home the two 
shared for five years, to repeated efforts by social workers to claim the 
actor's clothes and car for possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a Los Angeles Superior Court probate commissioner will decide whether 
the county, which has claimed jurisdiction of the case, must turn the 
administration of Rappaport's U.S. estate -- estimated by the family's attorney 
at $400,000 to $500,000 -- over to Frankie Leigh, Rappaport's cousin and 
business manager, as the actor's family has asked. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, the estate wound up in the county's hands for two reasons: Rappaport 
died without a will, and his heir -- the actor's 14-year-old son, Joseph -- is 
a British citizen. Under state law, a foreigner may not administer the estate 
of a California resident, and may not even appoint an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Practically, some observers of the case have suggested that the county -- which 
is typically too overburdened with the estates of poor people who die with no 
relatives to step in where it doesn't have to -- grabbed onto this case because 
of its notoriety and because the probate fees from a large estate can help 
cover the costs of administering smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Kent, manager of public administrator operations for the county, said that 
the county did have to step in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of a stakeholder, holding onto it until everything can get sorted 
out at the court level," Kent said. "The problem is that not one of the 
arrangements (that the family wants to make) was solidified in writing. So 
we're trying to protect all parties." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Rappaport's estate -- trust funds, savings, investments -- was kept in 
England, according to Jeff Wheeler, the Rappaport family's attorney. In the 
United States, he held only enough cash for day-to-day living, along with his 
house, clothes and car. 
</P>
<P>
The county, Kent said, is trying to make the estate more liquid, to generate 
cash both to increase the value of the estate and to pay for administrative 
costs. Accordingly, he said, his office has been attempting to induce Lende to 
pay rent or leave the house, and would like to sell the actor's possessions. 
</P>
<P>
To the family, the county's actions have been insensitive and intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
"The public administrator came to the door to lock up the car and seal it 
away," said Leigh. "They turned off the gas, electricity and water, then they 
turned off the phone and put a notice on the door, a 30-day notice to quit." 
</P>
<P>
While the county did agree to hold off taking possession of Rappaport's car, 
the family's appeals have fallen mostly on deaf ears, Leigh and Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to the counsel for the public administrator, and, frankly, I have not 
had more discussions with opposing counsel that I have disliked more," said 
Wheeler. "It became clear to me that he had this almost proprietary interest in 
the Rappaport estate, and then he implied that the family's desire to have 
Frankie as administrator was really a cover-up for mismanagement of the 
estate." 
</P>
<P>
The whole situation could have been avoided had Rappaport prepared a will. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why you have a will," said attorney Allan Cutrow, an estate and trust 
specialist with the firm Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp. "If you were to ask 
most probate lawyers about the kind of work we do on the litigation side, at 
least 60% of it is sorting out the relationships among people who were not 
provided for in the will." 
</P>
<P>
For this morning's hearing, the family has adopted a tactic that has worked in 
past cases: Leigh, a U.S. citizen, has been appointed as guardian of heir 
Joseph Rappaport's U.S. interests by the boy's mother in England. Wheeler said 
that he will ask the court to consider her, as guardian, to be legally 
qualified to administer the estate. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the tactic is successful, the court may choose not to make her 
administrator until the guardianship becomes permanent in August. The family 
fears that such a delay would enable the county to force Lende out of the house 
and to sell Rappaport's possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes an issue of personalities versus potential (legal) arguments," said 
James Birnberg, a leading estate and probate attorney with the firm Loeb &amp; 
Loeb, who was interviewed about the case. "As a matter of public policy, given 
that its role may be temporary, (the county) should not take irreversible 
steps. You have to look at it from a human point of view."

RAPPERS TO GET HELP FROM INDUSTRY ASSN.; 
</P>
<P>
THE COURTS: IT WILL ENTER A BRIEF ON BEHALF OF 2 LIVE CREW IN THE APPEAL OF A 
RULING THAT DECLARED THE 'NASTY' ALBUM OBSCENE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After months of sitting on the sidelines, the nation's major record companies 
-- through their industry association -- are stepping into the legal 
controversy surrounding Miami rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA), told 
The Times that the association will enter a friend of the court brief on behalf 
of 2 Live Crew in the group's upcoming appeal of a June 6 ruling by 
Florida-based U.S. District Court Judge Jose Gonzalez that declared obscene its 
"As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album. 
</P>
<P>
The RIAA's participation in the case -- which has led to the arrests in Florida 
of a record store owner for selling the album and two members of 2 Live Crew 
for performing a song from the album in an adults-only club -- is unusual in 
that 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell's company, Luke Records, is a 
non-member independent record company. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this case raises some of the most fundamental issues regarding freedom 
of speech," Berman said in a telephone interview this week from his Washington 
office. "We're very troubled by certain ideas addressed in the judge's 
obscenity decision. It has implications which we believe will not only affect a 
group like 2 Live Crew, but the music industry as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami rap group's attorney filed an appeal of the decision on June 11, but 
a court date has yet to be scheduled. Berman said his group is preparing 
arguments for the case focusing on First Amendment issues and has contacted the 
band's lawyer to offer legal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so troubled by the opening line of Judge Gonzalez's ruling, where he says 
this case is about a battle between two ancient enemies: Anything Goes and 
Enough Already," Berman said. "That is such a total and preposterous 
mischaracterization of the facts and it indicates to me that we have a very 
serious problem here about First Amendment protection regarding artistic 
expression." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Bennet, publicity director at Luke Records, was delighted that the 
record industry was finally stepping in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to know that people in the business are finally getting behind 
us," Bennet said in a phone interview. "I wish it hadn't taken so long for them 
to get involved, but hey, better late than never." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism that his organization was slow in responding to the 2 
Live Crew controversy, Berman explained that the RIAA has been preoccupied 
fighting off mandatory labeling bills proposed in more than a dozen state 
legislatures across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past six months, we've had to devote almost all our time and resources 
to defeating government sticker laws," Berman said. "It's not as if we've been 
sitting around here waiting for the shoe to fall. We haven't. 
</P>
<P>
"I represent over 50 companies," Berman said. "They just don't move with 
lightning speed. It's hard to get them to agree on any one particular thing." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, 
said he was also pleased to hear that the RIAA had finally decided to get 
involved in the 2 Live Crew court battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited that the RIAA is coming forward in a leadership role on 
this important issue," Greene said. "The industry needs to galvanize and 
protect our right to artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to address industry-related First Amendment issues, Greene said 
NARAS is putting together a massive "freedom of speech" protest march and 
concert, which is scheduled to take place in Washington late this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I think about how these conservative crusaders have tried to turn 
this into a religious issue, the angrier I get," Greene said. "I don't think 
the majority of American citizens intend to tolerate this kind of right-wing 
environment in America." 
</P>
<P>
Virgin Records president Jeff Ayeroff, a staunch opponent to government 
interference in the record business, also applauded the RIAA's stance on 2 Live 
Crew. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is just the beginning," Ayeroff said. "I think we need to register 
our constituency to vote. We must strike back like the pro-choice advocates are 
doing with the abortion issue and let politicians like Bob Martinez (the 
Florida governor who called national attention to 2 Live Crew after ordering an 
obscenity and racketeering probe of the rap group in January) know that if you 
mess with rock and roll, you will be voted out of office."

ARTISTS ADD 'BIG GREEN' TO THEIR PALETTES;

<P>
ENVIRONMENT: MAJOR WORKS DONATED TO A BENEFIT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

Eric Orr wants to save the Redwoods. George Herms wants to preserve an audience 
for his art. Woods Davy wants a good future for his children. 
</P>
<P>
But while differing on the reasons behind their involvement, the 33 mostly 
big-name artists -- who donated works for Saturday's "Artists Unite for Big 
Green" benefit -- all agree in the good of the cause. What has brought them 
together is their support for the Tom Hayden-led California Environmental 
Protection Act of 1990, better known as "Big Green." 
</P>
<P>
Katie Arnoldi, the wife of participating artist Charles Arnoldi and co-chair of 
"Artists Unite for Big Green," said the idea for the fund-raiser came about as 
a result of conversations with her artist friends, many of whom live at the 
beach in Venice and Santa Monica, and thus have special environmental concerns 
related to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something one can't not get involved with -- living on this planet," said 
Lita Albuquerque, who donated her 1978 photograph, "Blue Rock," to the effort. 
"There was no question that I would participate. We all have to live here and 
deal with these problems." 
</P>
<P>
Said Charles Arnoldi, who donated an untitled 1989 monoprint: "The environment 
is changing so rapidly, and it seems to me that we have to force people to deal 
with these issues -- the atmosphere, the ocean, food. And (Big Green) seems to 
cover all of those bases. I'm not overly political, but we all owe it to the 
planet. It may sound corny, but we've all got to do something. And if this 
thing passes, it's going to force them (the state's lawmakers) to deal with 
these issues." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which faces rival measures on November's ballot, is widely 
considered the most sweeping environmental initiative ever proposed in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Its provisions include: creating an elected Environmental Advocate to enforce 
all state health and environmental laws; phasing out by 1996 all pesticides 
shown to cause cancer or reproductive harm in laboratory animals; and phasing 
out all ozone depleting chemicals by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Through Saturday's benefit -- a party at Santa Monica Airport's DC-3 restaurant 
and a raffle of the artworks -- (organizers decided against an auction because 
they didn't want certain artists' works to garner more money than others) -- 
organizers hope to raise close to $200,000. But Arnoldi, who noted that a main 
goal of the event is to merely create publicity and a push for getting Big 
Green passed in November, noted that the fund-raising goal might be easily 
surpassed since "well over $100,000" had already been raised by the middle of 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the "Artists Unite for Big Green" party -- which runs from 1-4 p.m. 
and will be attended by lawmakers and celebrities -- are $75 each. Raffle 
tickets -- the grand prize is 16 of the show's 32 works -- will sell for $100 
each.

PLAYHOUSE HOPES TO OPEN IN SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A theater company is moving into the Encino Community Center. If all goes 
according to plan, the just-founded Encino Playhouse will stage its first 
production in the center's 250-seat theater in September. 
</P>
<P>
The group's founder, Stephanie Angelini, 38, is a set designer who has produced 
plays at small, local theaters. "I heard about the theater they had in the 
center and knew they had not had theatrical performances there for quite a 
while," she said. She made a proposal to the city's Recreation and Parks 
Department, which operates the center, and it was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
But there are restrictions, Angelini said. Because of commitments to 
non-theatrical groups already using the space, the center on Balboa Boulevard 
will allow the theater company to perform only on Fridays, Saturdays and 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Since the theater is larger than 99 seats, the Encino Playhouse is not eligible 
for a waiver from Equity, the stage actors union. Angelini is a long way from 
being able to afford union wages for her productions, so she will have to use 
mainly non-union actors. 
</P>
<P>
"But the union does allow me to use a restricted number of Equity actors under 
a guest contract, as long as I pay them the union wage," she said. "We would 
like to use at least one name actor in all our productions." 
</P>
<P>
She hopes that with name actors on board, she will be able to raise funds for 
productions from local businesses and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Angelini had planned on opening her first season with "A Thurber Carnival," but 
she now hopes to open with a new play. "I just got a wonderful script by a 
local playwright, Frawley Becker, that I would willingly hold 'Thurber 
Carnival' for if I can get the right actor for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Opening with a new play might not be playing it safe, but it would sure get us 
noticed," Angelini said.

THE BEBOP: TINY CULTURAL FLAME FLICKERS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The telephone has been ringing nonstop at Bebop Records and Fine Art this week. 
Owner Richard Bruland answers and says pretty much the same thing every time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got some bad news. I have to cancel your show," Bruland tells the 
musician or poet who was scheduled to perform at Bebop. "Don't take it 
personally. I have to cancel every show." 
</P>
<P>
For eight years, Bruland has struggled to make ends meet at his Reseda 
used-record store on Sherman Way, which nightly becomes an unusually eclectic 
performance space for poetry and music. Now, he is giving up the fight. Bebop 
will close at month's end. 
</P>
<P>
The police came into the shop last week, during a concert by the Apache 
Dancers, and informed Bruland that he was providing entertainment without the 
required cafe entertainment permit. Officers suggested that he could obtain 
such a permit and continue with business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
But Bruland said he can't afford to stay open without offering entertainment 
for the three weeks it takes to complete the application process. Rent is due 
on July 1, and he has lost his primary source of income -- concert audiences 
bought most of the records that Bebop sold each month and gave occasional 
donations. The 43-year-old shopkeeper said he "can read the writing on the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
"The store's financial situation has been grim for a long time," he said. "I 
had to scrape together change for gas to get home last night." 
</P>
<P>
Bebop has long been a favored San Fernando Valley hangout. The work of local 
artists hangs on the walls above record bins. The shop, which has a tiny stage 
at the back and room for 49 folding chairs, has hosted performances by 
well-known musicians such as Los Lobos, Exene Cervenka and Jane's Addiction. 
Literary figures such as Jim Carroll and Kate Braverman have read there. 
</P>
<P>
Just as often, Bruland booked new poets and bands -- like Victor Banana, sam i 
am and Zoogz Rift -- that no other club would take. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences at Bebop tended to be small -- a dozen or so people on a given night 
-- and quietly respectful. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bar. That's good. More people are getting into sobriety and a more 
thoughtful way of viewing things," said Cervenka, the former lead singer of X 
who appeared at a Bebop benefit three months ago. "It's ironic that the police 
are threatened by a place like this. It's as if they're afraid of a sober, 
intellectual atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Lydon and Kevin Bartnof said Bebop was the first shop that would sell 
their underground poetry magazine, The Moment, when it came out in 1987. 
Bruland often took time before performances to tell customers about the 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave lots of people a chance," Bartnof said. 
</P>
<P>
Bebop had been holding regular poetry nights since 1984, when such events had 
not yet become a celebrity-approved activity in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a boheme hangout, the sole gathering place for Valley underground 
types," Lydon said. "You'd think the cops would have something better to do 
than hassle a small business." 
</P>
<P>
Bruland insists that he doesn't blame the police. He suspects their visit was 
prompted by the recent discotheque fire in New York City, where 87 people were 
killed in an unlicensed and illegally run club. 
</P>
<P>
"The police were just doing their job," he said. "I've been expecting them to 
show up for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Though the shop had been open since 1982, police said they only recently became 
aware that it was hosting nighttime concerts. Vice detectives from the West 
Valley division walked in the door last Friday at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing and we didn't realize what was happening," said Bernadette 
Colmine, of the Apache Dancers, a country-rock band with Edith Piaf influences. 
"They did it all quietly out in the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Afterward, we talked to Richard," she said. "He was upset because he knew that 
if he could not have performances, he could not survive on just the record 
store. We were really upset to have been there at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Like other groups, the Apache Dancers enjoyed Bebop for its intimate setting. 
Most bands, no matter what their style, played acoustic sets there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like playing in the living room and I'm going to miss that," Colmine 
said. "There should be more and more places like that rather than less and 
less." 
</P>
<P>
As he prepares to pack up, the quiet-spoken Bruland said he is looking forward 
to spending more time with his own art, painting. Still, he couldn't help 
reminiscing about countless evenings spent listening to music and poetry. He 
recalled the time three years ago when La Loca, then unknown, showed up at an 
open-mike poetry night. 
</P>
<P>
"In walks this mysterious woman," he said. "She got up on stage and proceeded 
to mesmerize everybody." 
</P>
<P>
There were nights when local favorites, either poets or bands, attracted 
sold-out crowds. Other times, little-known musicians played solo . . . 
literally. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had more nights than I care to think about when there was nobody in the 
audience," he said. "But some of the best performances have been with two or 
three people in the audience." 
</P>
<P>
The first time Mary's Danish appeared at Bebop, several years ago, only 15 
people came. The band, which is now successful, was then newly formed. 
</P>
<P>
"They were as nervous as can be," Bruland said. "But you could tell that they 
were intent on doing their best." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Mary's Danish measured up to Bruland's Law of Good Music: "I want 
performers who, at the end of the evening, I feel I know more about them as 
persons, as opposed to knowing more about where they buy their clothes or where 
they get their hair done." 
</P>
<P>
Though Bruland refuses to criticize any form of music, such comments are a 
thinly veiled reference to heavy metal and its attendant culture. Bebop has 
never hosted such music, which is ironic because the shop operated all these 
years in the shadow of the Country Club, a large and successful heavy-metal 
club down the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to think that I cast my own shadow," Bruland said. "My own shadow was 
maybe smaller, but just as dark."

NO CREDIT CRUNCH IN U.S., BANKING REGULATORS INSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal banking regulators said Thursday that they see no evidence of a credit 
crunch in the United States, despite complaints in some regions that a federal 
crackdown in the wake of the savings and loan scandal has caused lending to dry 
up. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said any tightening by banks "does not appear to have 
been widespread" and has not been severe enough to become a drag on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the steps regulators took earlier this summer to ward 
off lender panic appear to have worked. But he added that customers with 
questionable credit-worthiness will -- and should -- have difficulty obtaining 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's assessment was supported by officials of the other top financial 
regulatory agencies -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Office of 
Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of the Currency. 
</P>
<P>
They conceded that some banks may have tightened lending practices too severely 
a few weeks ago, but they insisted that such cases were isolated and were not 
regulators' intent. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what implications, if any, Greenspan's assessment might have 
for broader money-and-credit policies -- specifically, whether the Fed, the 
nation's central bank, continues to hold its ground on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a solid majority of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market 
Committee, Greenspan has adamantly refused to nudge interest rates down further 
-- for fear of reigniting inflationary expectations. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the recent perception that there has been a 
"credit crunch" -- and the temporary retrenchment by some banks, particularly 
in New England -- will persuade the panel to ease up on the reins. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's hearing was scheduled in response to what lawmakers said was "a 
barrage of letters and telephone calls" from constituents complaining about the 
sudden reluctance of their banks to renew old loans -- or make new ones -- that 
they had willingly made before. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bush Administration officials have contended that the United States is 
suffering a credit crunch. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Housing 
Secretary Jack Kemp have voiced such views, though the White House has kept 
silent on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the senators generally conceded that free-wheeling lending was a major 
factor in the S&amp;L problem, many insisted that regulators be on guard to 
make sure banks do not overcompensate. 
</P>
<P>
"Erring on the side of caution should not become an excuse for being too 
tough," warned Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), whose state has been among the 
hardest-hit during the recent economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators insisted that any excessive retrenchment by banks was not at their 
bidding. "We haven't told bankers not to make loans, and we haven't told them 
to cut off credit from good customers," Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. 
Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reminded them to take care in making loans and, where necessary, we 
have required banks to recognize weaknesses in their portfolios and management 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the committee that the bulk of any cutback in lending has been 
in financing of corporate mergers and restructuring and in lending to highly 
leveraged borrowers, which the banks have begun to consider too risky. 
</P>
<P>
He also cited increased difficulty by developers and builders in obtaining 
loans for commercial construction -- a move that he said was designed partly to 
compensate for "lax lending standards" in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan insisted that "there are no indications" that home mortgages have 
become more difficult to obtain. He said interest charged on home mortgages has 
not risen more rapidly than that for other categories of loans. And 
down-payment requirements are unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman William L. Seidman, whose remarks were read by an aide while 
Seidman lay in a hospital bed recovering from a horseback-riding accident, said 
most of the small businesses that are experiencing difficulties are troubled, 
unprofitable or "shaky." 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, banks are to be applauded for tightening lending standards," he 
asserted. "Applying traditional prudent lending standards to this kind of 
borrower is a sound practice."

EQUIFAX TO BUY TELECREDIT FOR $577 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Telecredit, a Los Angeles-based check guarantee firm, said Thursday it agreed 
to be acquired by Equifax, a provider of consumer credit ratings and financial 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts hailed the tax-free stock-swap deal, valued at about $577 million 
based on Thursday's closing market prices, as one that would produce a faster 
growing, more competitive financial information company with revenues of more 
than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal makes an enormous amount of sense," said analyst Jackson Spears at 
Chicago Corp., a securities firm. "This is a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
Investors, however, were disappointed in the terms of the agreement, perhaps 
hoping that Telecredit might fetch a higher price. Telecredit closed at $50.75, 
down $2.50 in over-the-counter trading Thursday. Shares of Atlanta-based 
Equifax fell $2.625 to close at $19.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Telecredit stockholders would have the right to trade each 
of their shares for 2.69 common shares of Equifax. The companies have yet to 
set a date for the swap. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Thursday's closing prices, 2.69 shares of Equifax were worth $52.45, 
or $577 million for the entire company. That's below the $660 million -- or $60 
a share -- analysts had estimated Telecredit would fetch. Telecredit shares had 
been trading at about $43 last week, just before it announced merger talks with 
several unidentified firms. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives were enthusiastic about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes us so excited about merging with Equifax is that our businesses are 
extremely complementary," said Telecredit Chairman Lee A. Ault III, who will 
remain with the firm after the merger. "There is virtually no duplication." 
</P>
<P>
Ault said he was uncertain if the merger would trigger any layoffs of the 
company's 1,200 employees, or if Telecredit's operations would remain 
independent or be integrated into Equifax's. He said he expected the firm would 
be "substantially held intact" in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
"Over time, this is going to create opportunities for employees," Ault said. 
</P>
<P>
Telecredit guarantees $7 billion worth of checks a year for merchants. It also 
processes credit card transactions for credit unions and small- to medium-sized 
banks and savings and loans. Equifax sells information to insurance companies, 
operates collection agencies and ranks as one of the nation's largest consumer 
credit reporting firms. 
</P>
<P>
Spears said the merger would boost the fortunes of both firms, which have 
experienced slower growth in recent years. He noted that some of Telecredit's 
retail and financial customers might be interested in using Equifax's 
collection and credit rating services. Both firms also sell different types of 
marketing research information. 
</P>
<P>
Telecredit is "looking for ways to accelerate growth and improve marketing," 
said Spears. "Equifax is in a mature business. This was a good thing for them, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
"It gives Equifax the capability of offering more services to its customers," 
said information industry analyst J. Kendrick Noble Jr. at Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
In a move to discourage last-minute bidders, Equifax may also receive an option 
to purchase 19.5% of Telecredit's stock under the agreement. "That will give 
Equifax some protection in case somebody else should come in," Ault said.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: CALLER ID MAY BE PROFITABLE PRIVACY KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, the flap over Caller ID, which reveals a caller's number to the party 
telephoned, seems just a disagreement about the value of a minor new phone 
device. But it may be the opening salvo in a battle over the nature of today's 
phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
Because the service guards the privacy of the person called while destroying 
the caller's privacy, Caller ID will immediately affect even those who don't 
subscribe. It may also cost them several billion dollars a year to regain their 
privacy. Furthermore, if the service sells at all, the utilities' practice of 
just throwing out a product and making everyone adjust to its effects may 
become a preview of coming attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Caller ID defenders note that big businesses have for some years been 
"capturing" the numbers of people who call their 800 and 900 lines, matching 
them with other personal data for telemarketing lists. They also say Caller ID 
is just the latest of many ways that phones can be used like little computers: 
They now forward calls, store numbers, access bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
But with Caller ID, the subscriber isn't limited to his own private number, his 
own coded information. He gets the private number of another person, listed or 
not, without that person's knowledge or permission. "They used to fire people 
for giving out confidential numbers," says MIT sociologist Gary Marx. "What led 
to this reversal? They're trying to make a commodity out of the phone number, 
saying you don't own your own number, they do." 
</P>
<P>
If so, they're riding into the information age on a product that's gimmicky and 
redundant, and promoted in an unusually tacky way. It's a fear campaign, as 
several Bell Atlantic companies, the first to sell Caller ID widely, position 
it as a cure for "unwanted, abusive or threatening calls." 
</P>
<P>
As cures go, it's not well thought out: What should subscribers DO with the 
displayed number? "Many (subscribers) tell us they call these people back and 
tell them they have their number," says New Jersey Bell spokesman James W. 
Carrigan. But phone companies have advised generations to do the opposite, to 
"just hang up and report the call," says ACLU attorney Janlori Goldman in 
Washington. "It is irresponsible for a phone company to use Caller ID 
technology to wash its hands of the serious problem of harassing phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
If obscene calls are really the target, there are several products that do a 
better, safer job of screening, blocking or refusing calls than Caller ID, 
which only displays an unidentified number. There are answering machines. 
There's the "trap-and-trace" service that phone companies provide free to 
subscribers who are being bothered. There's Call Block (typically $4 a month), 
which cuts off any further calls from the same number, and Call Trace ($1 per 
use), which automatically records that number in a phone company database 
that's available to both phone and police authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Caller ID (typically $6.50 a month and $60 to $80 for a unit that displays the 
numbers) may not even be a good cure. New Jersey Bell credits Caller ID with 
reducing the occurrence there of obscene and harassing calls in the past two 
years, but the reduction cited is actually a 49% decrease in trap-and-trace and 
Call Trace usage. The cause may simply be that Caller ID took up some of the 
load, but New Jersey Bell "assumes a reduction in the number of calls made," 
says Carrigan. 
</P>
<P>
The service may yet prove unpopular. Even with bill inserts, TV and print ads, 
direct mail and telemarketing, only 2% of New Jersey Bell's subscribers took it 
(23% have Call Forwarding). They may not even understand what they bought: Half 
have unpublished numbers, in other words, a desire to keep their own number 
private. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the public view of Caller ID isn't favorable. A recent Harris poll 
sponsored by Equifax (the big credit reporting bureau) found that 55% of 
respondents thought Caller ID should be allowed. Forty-three percent said no. 
But when reminded that it reveals unlisted numbers and numbers of people 
calling help or hot lines, 55% said it should be regulated, and 25% said it 
should be banned completely. 
</P>
<P>
Most often recommended is some form of blocking, so people could keep their 
numbers from being displayed. This raises interesting questions: If enough 
people order both Caller ID and blocking, would the service have anything to 
sell? Wouldn't phone companies have to disclose what percent of lines are 
blocked? 
</P>
<P>
So far, most suggested blocking options are fairly wimpy (by contrast, a 
Pennsylvania judge barred the sale of Caller ID as illegal and 
unconstitutional). California will permit Caller ID (probably in 1991) only if 
it's paired with "per-call" blocking -- a burdensome exercise requiring callers 
to dial a code to activate blocking before each call. Even with "per-line" 
blocking, consumers would have to request that their line be blocked -- a 
required action that many will overlook. 
</P>
<P>
The phone companies favor much more costly solutions. People who want privacy 
are encouraged to make operator-assisted, credit card or pay phone calls, all 
more expensive. Alternatively (and incredibly), both Bell and GTE are pushing 
the purchase of second lines just for outgoing calls, with unlisted, 
never-answered numbers, or second numbers on the same phone. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of all those assisted, blocked, traced, and deflected calls could be 
several billion dollars a year, says Mark Cooper, director of research for the 
Consumer Federation of America. "The phone companies," he says, " are going to 
make 5 to 10 times as much money selling people back their privacy." 
</P>
<P>
The proverbial level playing field is needed here: People who don't want the 
new service shouldn't be injured by it. And under the old principle that an 
injured party must be made whole again, the blocking that undoes the effects of 
Caller ID should be both free and automatic. Those wanting their numbers 
displayed can ask to be unblocked.

NORTHROP PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE, WILL SELL SOME FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop will consolidate its aircraft business within the next 60 days, 
shifting some operations from Pico Rivera to Palmdale and eliminating some 
surplus facilities at its large complex in Hawthorne, it was learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The company has previously announced that it would eliminate 3,000 jobs this 
year, but the consolidation holds the potential for further layoffs of an 
undetermined number. The company employs 41,000, about 75% of whom are in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at cost reductions across the board," said Northrop spokesman 
Tony Cantafio. "We already announced there are going to be 3,000 layoffs. We 
are always looking at achieving further cost reductions." 
</P>
<P>
The entire aerospace industry is rapidly falling into a chaotic consolidation, 
with thousands of workers being laid off across the country and the financial 
fortunes of major corporations taking a historic battering. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the consolidation, Northrop officials are examining a wide variety 
of options, including the acquisition of additional facilities in Palmdale. 
Northrop representatives held a meeting with Rockwell International earlier 
this week regarding that firm's surplus capacity in Palmdale, according to 
well-informed industry sources. Northrop officials said Rockwell, the prime 
contractor for the B-1 bomber, will not be a B-2 subcontractor, however. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation at Northrop will fall under the general guidelines set down 
by company president Kent Kresa at the firm's annual shareholders meeting last 
month. Under Kresa's direction, the company sold its headquarters building in 
Century City and a manufacturing plant in Anaheim. It is reportedly seeking to 
sell a Palos Verdes research facility and a number of facilities in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's elimination of 3,000 jobs is already creating some surplus space. 
And Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in late April cut future production of B-2 
bombers from the 132 originally planned to just 75, which may create even more 
pressure for consolidation on Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to take full advantage of the reduced (B-2) program to cut overhead 
costs, improve inventory management and make better use of our facilities, 
especially by reducing duplication and increasing the sharing of facilities 
among various operating center," Kresa said last month. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the buildings at Northrop's Hawthorne complex are old and in some cases 
dilapidated, workers say. One Northrop worker told The Times last week that he 
was injured when he slipped in a quarter inch pool of water that had leaked 
through the roof at a facility involved in the production of fuselages for the 
Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop leases a significant number of buildings in Hawthorne, while it owns 
its Pico Rivera plant. Lawrence Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards, estimated that Northrop owns 218 acres of land in Hawthorne, worth 
$410 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa said the company was examining 13 different joint projects in an effort 
to increase efficiency. As part of that effort, the firm's YF-23 Advanced 
Tactical Fighter program would be relocated from Hawthorne to Pico Rivera, if 
the firm wins its competition against Lockheed for a full scale development 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
If the ATF is moved to Pico Rivera, it would leave Northrop's Hawthorne 
operations with just production of fuselage sections for the Boeing 747 
jetliner and guidance systems at its electronics division. The firm also 
produces the F-18 aft fuselage at its facility in El Segundo, which is believed 
to have a large amount of surplus space. 
</P>
<P>
The F-18 program is winding down, making the El Segundo property a prime 
candidate for a future elimination. But the 747 production is continuing to 
build up and Northrop is expected to supply five fuselages per month to Boeing. 
It is unlikely that Northrop will move production of that program in 
mid-stream, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, employees at Northrop's Ventura plant are worried that Northrop will 
close that facility and send some of the work there to a new plant in Perry, 
Ga. Northrop has declined to answer questions about the future of the Ventura 
plant, which is located in Newbury Park.

Garfinckel's Owner Files for Bankruptcy: The owner of the upscale District of 
Columbia department store chain Garfinckel's said it has filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection and will liquidate the inventories at its nine stores. 
</P>
<P>
Garfinckels Holding Co. also said it has laid off 200 of its 850 employees. 
Investors rescued the company from a financial crisis in 1988 by recruiting new 
management and providing funding. The retailer attributed part of its woes to 
the fact that it had changed hands five times since the early 1980s, resulting 
in different marketing strategies that "significantly impaired" its image among 
customers.

GNP Revised Upward: The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew 
at its second-slowest pace in 3 1/2 years from January through March. The gross 
national product -- the nation's total output of goods and services -- grew at 
a revised 1.9% annual rate in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the department revised a price index tied to the GNP to show 
an annualized inflation rate of 6.4% for the quarter. The department said half 
of that increase was because of rising food and energy prices caused by unusual 
winter weather. Analysts predicted that prices would decline during the rest of 
the year. They said they expect only modest improvement in the GNP for the rest 
of the year. The first-quarter GNP was up from the 1.1% annualized rate in the 
final quarter of 1989. That was the slowest quarterly growth since a 0.8% gain 
in the summer of 1986.

Grumman, Boeing Settle Counterclaims: Details were not released, but the 
companies said they have eliminated claims by both parties over the cost of 
completing the first two modified Boeing 707s built for the STARS project, or 
"surveillance target attack radar system." Grumman won the $657-million STARS 
contract in 1985 and is in the final phase of flight testing before handing the 
project to the Air Force for its own testing. The disagreement arose when 
Boeing requested $122.5 million in addition to the initial $80.2 million that 
it was awarded for modifying the 707 airframes.

BATEMAN EICHLER CHIEF RICHARD CAPALBO QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard J. Capalbo, chairman and chief executive of Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards regional brokerage, has resigned to pursue other interests and has 
been replaced by Allan L. Sher, former vice chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders had speculated that Capalbo was not long for Bateman since 
Chicago-based Kemper Corp., parent company of the Los Angeles brokerage, last 
month announced plans to consolidate some operations of its five regional 
brokerages and to lay off about 600 of the firms' 5,200 employees. The move, 
prompted by the slowdown in the securities industry, was seen as greatly 
reducing the authority of the regional brokerage heads. 
</P>
<P>
But James R. Boris, chairman and chief executive of Kemper Securities Group 
Holdings and Capalbo's boss, said the 43-year-old executive was not forced out 
but decided to leave on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked together for just a few months," said Boris, who took his position 
in January, "but we found we had considerably different management styles, and 
he decided it was best for him to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Capalbo nor Sher was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Boris said the appointment of the 58-year-old Sher, who had headed West Coast 
operations for Drexel, "should send a clear message that we are fully committed 
to the retail brokerage firm." 
</P>
<P>
Capalbo, an aggressive salesman who once worked for Drexel, had beefed up 
Bateman's nontrading operations, including investment banking and municipal 
finance, only to see those businesses greatly reduced in the consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no surprise," said one investment banker. "Richard is leaving because 
of the fact that the whole regional autonomous stand-alone nature of Bateman is 
leaving with him. . . . Capalbo didn't want to be Boris' puppet." 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s are over, and the '90s have begun. I think Kemper is pulling in its 
horns," another investment banker said. "This is not a cheap business to be 
in," and Bateman was believed to be losing money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sher also was a director and member of the executive committee of Drexel, which 
filed for bankruptcy law protection in February. Sher began his career in the 
securities industry in 1956 with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. NANCY RIVERA BROOKS

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: CARE AND FEEDING OF BANKERS IS KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Morris, chief executive of Envirotech International in Houston, had a 
problem. He needed a way to establish credit for customers who wanted to 
finance his company's water treatment systems. 
</P>
<P>
His first discussions with local bankers were discouraging. Envirotech had only 
been in business two years, and bankers traditionally require three years of 
financial statements before considering a business-loan application. 
</P>
<P>
In his ultimately successful quest for financing, Morris learned a big lesson: 
You can never tell a banker too much about your business. 
</P>
<P>
Many small-business owners think that bankers know everything about all kinds 
of businesses, but that isn't true. The small-business owner needs to make sure 
the banker understands what the business is all about and why the money about 
to be borrowed is so critical to the venture's success. 
</P>
<P>
As Morris persisted, he finally met Joel Pearson, an assistant vice president 
at First Interstate Bank of Texas, who agreed to review Morris' customer list 
and equipment brochures. 
</P>
<P>
"With that information, I was able to show Pearson how we differed from other 
water companies by not using chemicals," said Morris. 
</P>
<P>
"They went through their sales pitch," said Pearson, who later agreed to 
consider loan applications from Envirotech clients. "They were certainly 
enthusiastic and excited about their products." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who recently moved his 14 employees into larger quarters, attributes 
much of his company's success to support from Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
Small-business bankers say they wish more entrepreneurs would find out what a 
banker needs to feel comfortable. And, they say, the very best time to set up a 
banking relationship is before you need the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Invest time talking with prospective bankers," said Douglas Freeman, executive 
vice president of Wells Fargo Bank's business loan division in San Francisco. 
"Explain your business, its cycles and its cash needs." 
</P>
<P>
"Bankers don't like surprises," said Williams Arant Jr., president and chief 
executive officer of First National Bank of Knoxville, Tenn. "The worst thing 
in the world is to hear something is wrong with a client's business through the 
grapevine or to read it in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Besides open communication, Arant said the thing that makes a banker most 
comfortable is the "feeling that the customer really knows his business." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Mynard, chairman of the American Bankers Assn.'s small-business banking 
unit, said if problems develop, don't wait until the last minute to call your 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing a small business owner can do is beg his banker for help on a 
Thursday because he can't meet a Friday payroll," Mynard said. 
</P>
<P>
He said dealing with entrepreneurs is interesting and dynamic, but frequently a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to gain a banker's confidence, ask for something specific. Do you 
need a long-term loan to refinance existing debt, expand your business or 
introduce new products? Do you need a credit line to provide short-term working 
capital? How about a business credit card for keeping track of travel and 
entertainment expenses? 
</P>
<P>
Once you've figured out what you need the money for, be prepared to present 
three years' worth of financial statements, business and personal tax returns, 
a historical summary of the business and a secondary source of repayment. 
</P>
<P>
You will also need a clearly written current balance sheet, profit-and-loss 
statement, cash-flow projections and information on accounts receivable and 
accounts payable. 
</P>
<P>
If your business is incorporated, your banker needs to know if the stockholders 
will cover the losses. If you are in a partnership, the bank usually requires 
all principals to sign a personal guarantee for the loan. Sole proprietors will 
be asked to back up the loan with personal assets such as a home. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers are not magicians, and there is little mystery surrounding how they 
decide whether to lend you the money. In addition to historical and industry 
factors, lenders rely on ratios to determine short-term liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
A quick way to figure your liquidity is to add up the cash on hand, accounts 
receivable and marketable securities, then divide that sum by your current 
liabilities including accounts payable, loans outstanding and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
But remember, every industry has its own ratios. If your ratio is 3 to 1 and 
the industry average is 7 to 1, you won't look like a very good risk to a loan 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to please a banker, read "Steps to Small Business Financing" before 
applying for your next loan. The fact-filled booklet is published jointly by 
the American Bankers Assn. and the National Federation of Independent Business. 
Single copies are available for $2.50 by sending a check to Small Business 
Financing, NFIB Foundation, Box 7575, San Mateo, Calif. 94403.

<P>
HOW TO MAKE YOUR BANKER LOVE YOU 
</P>
<P>
Think of your banker as a business partner. 
</P>
<P>
Invite your banker to visit your business to see exactly what you are doing and 
how you do it. 
</P>
<P>
Communicate regularly -- the good news as well as the bad. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, bankers hate surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Find out exactly what kind of documents a banker needs to process a loan -- 
because inadequate documentation creates unnecessary delays. 
</P>
<P>
To generate enthusiasm for a proposed product or service, ask your banker what 
he or she thinks of it. An involved banker is more likely to make a good 
presentation to the loan committee.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CONSIDER STOCKS THAT ARE DOWN NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While many folks on Wall Street are still waiting for a steep market selloff -- 
a correction, as it is called -- a few stocks are already deep into their own 
private declines. Investors who have been considering getting into some solid 
stocks for the long run might want to look at some of the recently wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Take Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering. The stock has come down 17%, from its 
May peak of $25.50, to $21.125. That kind of quick move isn't unusual for a 
thinly traded stock such as Jacobs, but it frustrates the company nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs is a major player in plant design and construction and in hazardous 
waste cleanup. The company's orders have been booming, as corporate capital 
spending has soared worldwide. Hours billed in May were a record, says Nazim 
Thawerbhoy, Jacobs' controller. "Our fundamentals are as strong as before or 
even stronger," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jacobs sellers may have been reacting to competitor Fluor Corp.'s 
disappointing earnings for the quarter ended April 30, which Fluor reported 
June 5. But Jacobs isn't in the same boat, Thawerbhoy says. "We don't expect 
our earnings to be down" this quarter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At $21.125, Jacobs sells for 18 times the $1.20 a share it should earn this 
year. Fluor, meanwhile, sells for about 27 times estimated 1990 earnings. 
Thawerbhoy figures Jacobs deserves better. 
</P>
<P>
Another thinly traded stock that's off sharply since May is MagneTek Inc. The 
L.A.-based company is a big name in electrical equipment, such as motors, 
ballasts, controls and transformers. Its customers include the aerospace, 
utility and construction industries. 
</P>
<P>
MagneTek's stock has dropped to $10.50, down 16% from its May peak of $12.50. 
Yet business still appears to be on track: Revenue in the third quarter, ended 
March 31, rose 16% from a year earlier to $286 million. Earnings jumped 27% to 
47 cents a share. The firm also has said that it anticipates a "strong" June 30 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
So why the drop in the stock? MagneTek went public a year ago and on June 13 a 
restriction was lifted on the ability of some big stockholders to sell shares. 
The market figured a lot might be dumped. That hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
There still is concern about a 6% block of the stock owned by First Executive 
Corp., the troubled insurance firm. First Executive was rumored to have been 
selling some of the shares last week. But Otto Stoll, a MagneTek spokesman, 
said: "My understanding is that they did not sell." First Executive, as a rule, 
never comments on its trades. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, MagneTek now sells for less than 10 times annualized earnings per 
share -- a price that appears to have recession worries firmly built into it, 
and one that reflects the firm's relatively high debt load. Unless orders 
suddenly collapse, MagneTek may be in shape to surprise Wall Street with 
healthy earnings growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
Two other sold-off stocks that may be bargains now: personal computer maker AST 
Research of Irvine and Goleta-based Applied Magnetics Corp., which makes 
magnetic recording heads for the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
On June 13, AST called for redemption of some debentures, which will create 3 
million new AST shares. About 12 million are outstanding now. 
</P>
<P>
While the market will have to digest that new stock, investors eventually will 
begin refocusing on the company's strong computer sales, which remain "very 
much" on track, says spokesman Don Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Magnetics, meanwhile, is experiencing "tremendous demand" for its 
recording heads, says Todd Bakar, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that most of the company's manufacturing is done in South Korea, 
and the firm has faced labor strife there recently over such issues as 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But Bakar believes Applied will work out the problems quickly, and says demand 
is so strong that earnings should reach 76 cents a share this year and $1.65 
next. If he's right, this is a cheap stock. 
</P>
<P>
A Gold List for Shearson?American Express has always jealously guarded the 
names of its cardholders, especially those who hold the upper-crust gold and 
platinum cards. Not even Shearson Lehman Hutton, American Express' brokerage 
operation, has had access to that customer list. 
</P>
<P>
That could change soon. AmEx confirms that it is considering sharing gold and 
platinum cardholders' names with Shearson. The list could be a mother lode for 
Shearson brokers who are trying to bring in new business, because gold and 
platinum cardholders are, in theory at least, a well-heeled group. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions about cross-marketing within AmEx are part of a major 
reorganization, designed to boost profits. As part of the reorganization, 
Jonathan Linen was named head of Shearson on May 29. He had been in charge of 
AmEx's direct-marketing group, and his background suggests he knows how to 
boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
AmEx won't say how many gold and platinum cards are outstanding, but 
credit-card guru Spencer Nilson of the Santa Monica-based Nilson Report 
estimates there are 6.4 million gold cards in the United States and 250,000 
platinum cards. Green AmEx cards number about 15.2 million in the United 
States, Nilson says. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Shares of L.A.-based food wholesaler Rykoff-Sexton Inc. have surged to 
$19, up from $16.625 at the end of May. This week, Rykoff reported earnings for 
the quarter ended April 28, and the stock got a further lift from the report. 
</P>
<P>
Rykoff ran into trouble last winter, so Wall Street knew the latest quarter 
would be a disaster. But the 62% drop in earnings, to 18 cents a share, 
apparently wasn't as bad as expected. The Wisconsin Investment Board, that 
state's public pension fund, owns 1 million Rykoff shares (9%) and continues to 
take a positive view of the company, a board spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
They always said stocks were just a big crap shoot, right? Even so, Washington 
state's latest lottery game isn't winning a lot of fans in the investment 
world: The game, called "Wall Street," is advertised as "the excitement of 
investing without the inherent risks." 
</P>
<P>
The average public commodity fund plunged 5.8% in value in May, reversing a 
six-month string of big gains for investors in those risky ventures, reports 
Norwood Securities of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The funds' winning streak had averaged gains of 2.75% a month since November, 
but many fund managers got murdered by being short on Treasury bond futures in 
May, Norwood reports.

While many analysts expect a significant "correction" in the stock market soon, 
these stocks already have suffered sharp drops from their spring highs.

BUCHWALD CASE TO FOCUS ON STUDIOS' PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Pictures Corp., defending itself against a lawsuit by humorist Art 
Buchwald, explained in legal documents that big Hollywood studios use a 
definition of "net profit" that is quite different from the generally accepted 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim sued Paramount, 
claiming that their script called "King for a Day" was the basis for the film 
"Coming to America." They contended they were entitled to a portion of the 
film's net profits. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount lost the case, and the trial is heading into its second phase -- a 
determination of how much money, if any, is owed to Buchwald and Bernheim. 
</P>
<P>
Each side has lined up experts in the arcane science of studio accounting 
practices to support their cases in the second phase of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald argues that Paramount's definition of "net profit" is unfair if judged 
by generally accepted accounting standards. The studios, Buchwald asserts, 
collude to offer everybody identically unfair terms, thus making it impossible 
to shop a script or movie idea around for a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs charge that the system forces writers and producers like 
themselves into "take-it-or-leave-it" arrangements with studios, a prickly 
legal area known under California law as "contracts of adhesion." 
</P>
<P>
How much net profit, or loss, "Coming to America" reported is at the heart of 
the second phase of hearings set to resume July 9 in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. Lawyers for Buchwald claim that the 1988 film earned $40 million and 
that Buchwald and Bernheim are entitled to 19% of the net profits. 
</P>
<P>
But during the first phase of the suit, Paramount disclosed that Buchwald and 
Bernheim were not due a dime, since the film was $18 million short of making a 
net profit -- despite taking in $247 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming hearing before Judge Harvey Schneider, both sides will square 
off over what is the proper definition of four of the most cherished words in 
the Hollywood lexicon: "net profits" and "gross receipts." 
</P>
<P>
According to Paramount, "What must be kept in mind . . . is that net profit 
participations . . . are negotiated contractual definitions which have evolved 
within the motion picture industry and have little to do with real profit of a 
picture as measured by generally accepted accounting principles." 
</P>
<P>
The studio maintains that the definition of "net profit" is clearly spelled out 
in Buchwald and Bernheim's contract and are the same terms generally used in 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount contends that the plaintiffs were free to negotiate a better deal or 
take their idea to another studio. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfathomable that anybody even remotely connected to the business would 
claim they don't understand" the terms of their contract, said Charles Diamond, 
Paramount's attorney in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The studio offers the sworn testimony of nine industry accounting experts to 
back its position. 
</P>
<P>
"More than most industries, the motion picture community has fashioned a 
complex but universally understood set of rules that reasonably allocate risks, 
rewards and controls in a business where failures outnumber successes. The 
contracts that embody these rules are a more reliable measure of what is 
'fair,' 'equitable' or 'conscionable' than any doctrine the law might import." 
</P>
<P>
But Zazi Pope, an attorney for Buchwald and Bernheim, says Paramount's argument 
that "everybody does it " is "no defense." 
</P>
<P>
Pope and attorney Pierce O'Donnell have sworn statements from leading 
entertainment-industry accountants and lawyers, including the former vice 
president of business affairs at Universal, illustrating how studios such as 
Paramount engineer deals that preclude or substantially reduce the possibility 
that a film will ever show a net profit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the studio practices they attack is the concept of the "rolling 
break-even," which was introduced by Universal in the 1970s and subsequently 
adopted "without fanfare" by all the other movie companies. 
</P>
<P>
In "rolling break-even," explained Rudolph Petersdorf, the former Universal 
executive, a studio "feeds gross -- and adjusted gross -- participations back 
into the negative costs of the film, continuously pushing -- rolling -- back 
the point at which a picture breaks even and supposedly begins generating net 
profits." 
</P>
<P>
That "has had a serious adverse effect on the ability of net profit 
participants to receive net profits."

NASD VOWS RULE ON UNEQUAL VOTING

The National Assn. of Securities Dealers Inc. says it will introduce its own 
rule to protect corporate stockholders from unequal voting rights if a federal 
version remains struck down by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a federal appeals court in Washington unanimously held that the 
Securities and Exchange Commission exceeded its authority in prohibiting 
publicly traded corporations from weakening the voting power of those who 
already own stock in the company. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has yet to say if it will appeal the decision by a three-judge panel of 
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
But Joseph Hardiman, president of the NASD, said if the ruling is upheld "we 
will propose a look-alike rule." The NASD is a self-regulating organization 
overseeing over-the-counter stocks.

SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI DRIVES OFF WITH MORE TOYOTA BUSINESS

Oh, what a feeling to advertise Toyota. Just ask executives at the Torrance 
agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific, which on Thursday won another 
$20-million chunk of Toyota business. 
</P>
<P>
Its newest client is Southeast Toyota Distributors Inc., of Deerfield Beach, 
Fla. The group is responsible for Toyota vehicles distributed in five Southern 
states. Saatchi's Los Angeles office will open branch offices in Ft. Lauderdale 
and Atlanta to service the new client. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no better compliment than to be awarded a new piece of business from 
someone who knows us and our work so well," Joe Cronin, president of the 
agency, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific handles the lion's share of Toyota's 
advertising nationwide -- affecting more than 500 Toyota dealerships. Besides 
Toyota's corporate advertising, it also handles 12 dealership associations and 
two Toyota distributorships. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, a growing number of Japanese dealer associations -- including 
Toyota, Nissan and Isuzu -- have hired the agencies that also create ads for 
the auto makers. These auto groups generally say that the corporate agency has 
a better feel for the company's image, and the associations can save money by 
purchasing advertising time and space in bulk.

The board of home-furnishings maker Tandy Brands Inc. has approved a plan to 
spin off its accessories unit into a firm whose common stock will be 
distributed as a tax-free dividend to parent-company stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, which will make men's and boys' leather products and neckwear, 
will be called Tandy Brands Accessories Inc. Tandy Brands was itself spun off 
from Tandy Corp., the electronics giant, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Under the latest spinoff plan, stockholders will get 20 Tandy Brands 
Accessories shares for every 100 Tandy Brands shares they own. 
</P>

When the spinoff is complete, Tandy Brands is expected to take the name of its 
other operating division, Bombay Co.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GROUPS ACT TO HELP VICTIMS;

RELIEF: CASH DONATIONS ARE BEST FOR STARTERS, RED CROSS SAYS. IRANIAN

Relief organizations and Southern California's Iranian community geared up 
Thursday to solicit money and other assistance for victims of Iran's 
devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to provide assistance now is to send a cash donation," said Peggy 
McGinley of the American Red Cross. "Those funds will be channeled through our 
international network to the Red Crescent Society in Iran." 
</P>
<P>
McGinley said the Red Cross will help in providing other aid "once we learn 
what their needs are. But cash proves to be more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
Checks can be made out to the American Red Cross, Iranian Relief and sent to 
2700 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, 90057. Contributions can also be sent to any 
local Red Cross chapter, McGinley said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 Iranians live in Southern California, and the statewide total is 
more than 700,000, representatives of Iranian community organizations said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, leaders of the 80,000-member Iranian-American community 
rallied to send supplies to the devastated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling people to bring blankets, clothing and medicine, especially 
antibiotics, to the Westminster Cultural Center," said Dr. Farrokh Shadab, a 
physician and president of the Iranian Cultural Affairs Center. 
</P>
<P>
Coalitions of Iranian community groups across the state met Thursday evening in 
an effort to develop a coordinated approach to assisting their stricken 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 1,500 to 2,000 calls today from people asking how they can help," 
said Bijan Khalili, a board member of the Van Nuys-based Iranian Refugee Relief 
Organization. "The most important thing is to concentrate the efforts that 
Iranians in this country and anybody else can give." 
</P>
<P>
The refugee relief organization has opened a bank account at Bank of America to 
accept contributions, Khalili said. Donations can be made at any Bank of 
America branch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Islamic Center of Southern California will offer a special prayer 
for the victims today and begin collecting money, clothing and medicines, said 
center spokesman Maher Hathout. 
</P>
<P>
"The money will be sent to the Red Crescent in Iran through the Red Cross," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based relief organization, asked that funds, 
rather than specific items, be donated so that only necessary relief supplies 
are brought into the earthquake zone. 
</P>
<P>
Cash contributions can be sent to Operation USA, 7615 1/2 Melrose Ave., Los 
Angeles 90046 (213) 658-8876. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, leaders of the Iranian Cultural Affairs Center issued a call 
for blankets, clothing and medicine -- especially antibiotics. They are being 
collected at the Westminster Cultural Center, 8361 Westminster Blvd. in 
Westminster, said Shadab 
</P>
<P>
Soliciting financial contributions has been frustrating at times because 
distrust of the current regime is preventing many Iranian-Americans from making 
donations, some community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Farrokh Shokooh, a civil engineer from Mission Viejo, said "it's a shame" that 
political considerations are blocking needed aid.

IRANIAN MEDIA LOW KEY IN REPORTING ON KILLER QUAKE 
</P>

<P>
Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake 
that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The country has endured several massive tragedies in recent years. An estimated 
1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq that 
ended in 1988. And the Islamic revolution that in 1979 toppled the late Shah 
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi cost hundreds of thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
And devastating quakes are not new to the country. About 25,000 people died in 
eastern Iran in a 1978 earthquake. Roughly the same number died in a December, 
1988, quake in nearby Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian media, monitored from Nicosia, was quick to report Thursday's 
earthquake. Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that 
the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have 
been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared 
in Zanjan and Gilan provinces. 
</P>
<P>
The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran 
residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between 
Brazil and Scotland. The report said that many people fled into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the news agency's earliest reports dramatically underestimated the 
magnitude of the disaster. While IRNA reported 10,000 dead late Thursday, the 
Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said 25,000 people had died. 
</P>
<P>
Official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck, and although it came 
back on the air to report important news during the Iran-Iraq War, there was no 
such move Thursday. Iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main 
newscast 6 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The radio, like the agency, also kept listeners informed about the areas hit 
and the number of casualties. But again, the reporting lacked color and 
description for hours. 
</P>
<P>
The television's first shots from the stricken north were screened 12 hours 
after the quake with no comment from reporters. When the scenes were replayed 
during newscasts, the anchors appeared unshaken by chilling clips such as one 
showing a stuffed toy and a small shoe lying in a street carpeted with debris. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared a three-day period of mourning 
for quake victims. But the television showed cartoons and an educational 
program for children and ended its programming with live transmission of a 
World Cup soccer match between Egypt and England.

The state's capital has struck down sexism in its streets by changing the name 
of its manholes to "maintenance holes." The change was signaled at a City 
Council meeting as members approved amendments to an ordinance concerning the 
use of sewers. 
</P>
<P>
No one called attention to the name change, although the issue received 
national attention in late April, when it was reported that officials were 
looking for a practical non-sexist term. Two city civil engineers proposed, 
tongue-in-cheek, a "Manhole Terminology Change Contest," and it was suggested 
that the female majority in the mayor's office and City Council was behind the 
proposal. However, officials denied that they had put any pressure on the 
Public Works Department. Department Director Melvin Johnson said that 
"maintenance hole" is practical, because it will spare the department from 
having to revamp its maps, which designate manholes as "MH."

A former Marine convicted of vandalizing the California Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial was ordered to scrub it clean every weekend for one year. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody asks you what you're doing and why you're doing that, tell them 
you did something bad to the memorial and you're paying for it," Municipal 
Judge R. G. Vonasek told Stanley Del La Cruz. A jury convicted the 33-year-old 
landscaper of misdemeanor vandalism in breaking a six-inch piece off a 
life-size M-16 bronze rifle on the monument in February, 1989. Del La Cruz 
contended that the barrel accidentally broke off when he grabbed it to pull 
himself to his feet from a kneeling position after praying for "the soldiers 
and their mothers."

The Christa McAuliffe Planetarium was dedicated Thursday as a memorial to the 
teacher killed in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and to honor 
her passion for motivating children to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"This planetarium is more than a memorial to Christa McAuliffe . . . it is more

</P>
<P>
It is a promise to continue the work she believed in and a promise to fulfill 
her dream," NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people, including some of McAuliffe's former students and White 
House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, attended the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.6-million planetarium is New Hampshire's official memorial to the 
37-year-old Concord High School teacher, who died with six other crew members 
when the space shuttle exploded in January, 1986.

SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW MART

SAN FRANCISCO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mention Baghdad by the Bay, and visions of cable cars, steamed crab legs and 
the Golden Gate Bridge pop readily to mind. 
</P>
<P>
But trend-setting fashion? Unlikely in this bastion of liberal thinking but 
conservative dressing. Not since flower children donned bell-bottoms and 
tie-dyed T-shirts in the heyday of Haight-Ashbury has San Francisco fomented 
anything close to a fashion rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Two developers, based in San Francisco and Atlanta, have joined forces in an 
attempt to change all that. To showcase the Bay Area's growing cadre of 
contemporary designers, as well as established names, they've plunged ahead 
with a gleaming new $90-million wholesale Fashion Center in the city's funky 
South of Market district. For now at least, it is open only to the trade. 
</P>
<P>
At its first show this week, the center was host to about 3,000 department and 
specialty store buyers -- mostly from Northern California and the Pacific 
Northwest -- who flocked to the six-floor, 740,000-square-foot building. The 
center -- complete with atrium and tiers of inviting, glass-fronted showrooms 
-- is slated to open officially in August with a holiday/cruise show. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Fashion Center will provide is . . . a recharging of the apparel 
industry in San Francisco," said Tom Mitchell, general manager of the facility, 
two-thirds of which has been leased. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Mitchell noted, San Francisco is no slouch in the garment trade, 
despite its unintentionally low profile. With apparel manufacturing worth $5 
billion a year, San Francisco is the country's third-largest garment center, 
after New York and Los Angeles. And the Bay Area weighs in with $6 billion in 
annual retail sales of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the region is already widely known as the home of such veterans as 
Levi Strauss, Esprit de Corp, The Gap and Jessica McClintock. But some 
less-established names -- including Lilli Ann, Fong Chong, Suzanne Hanley, 
Oblong Rhonda and Q Rolo -- are hoping the new center will give them needed 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
As Mitchell sees it, creating a wholesale "shopping mall" will make it easier 
for store representatives from the nation's 11-state Northwest region to spot 
hot designs and get them quickly to their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, San Francisco has not had a dependable one-stop-shopping place for 
displaying lines and holding fashion markets. For the last eight years, shows 
were held in an exhibition center that also was used for a variety of other 
trade shows. And the Pacific Apparel Center, where many designers had their 
showrooms, recently filed for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Many stores have sent their buyers instead to Los Angeles, where the 
26-year-old California Mart has more than 3 million square feet with 2,000 
showrooms occupied year-round. (San Francisco's center has 550 permanent 
showrooms.) 
</P>
<P>
One fashion consultant expressed concern that the Fashion Center could face a 
rough road as it tries to lure store buyers, given the general debt-related 
shakiness among retailers and the close proximity of the more powerful Los 
Angeles mart. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time of total confusion in the fashion business," said Marjorie S. Dean, 
chief executive of New York-based Tobe Associates, "this just adds to the 
perplexities."

Eagle Performance Racing of Santa Barbara went to Le Mans last week with an 
obsolete race car, an untried engine, two rookie drivers on a bread and cheese 
budget -- and France loved every audacious moment of this lone Yankee Doodle 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
But worship wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle's 2-year-old Chevrolet Corvette prototype did not finish in the francs.

"It was a lot of little things that added up to a lot," said team driver Dennis 
Kazmerowski. "The first problem was a vapor lock in one radiator that caused 
overheating." 
</P>
<P>
Overheating burned pistons and scored cylinders. Race inspectors declared the 
car a centimeter too short here, a millimeter too long there. The exhaust pipe 
measured too low. The rear spoiler rose too high. 
</P>
<P>
"Even our American driving suits didn't meet safety requirements for European 
racing," said Kazmerowski. "We got everything fixed and then found the 
alternator was not pumping out enough juice (electricity). 
</P>
<P>
"Out in practice, after about 10 laps, the car just quit, dead, and we couldn't 
get it started again in time for the race." 
</P>
<P>
Yet buoyed by fun and friendly headlines (one French newspaper described the 
American car with its huge, 900-horsepower engine as: Le Monstre Retour), the 
support of fans (two California tourists located the team and presented them 
with a story about them that had appeared in the Los Angeles Times) and 
informal invitations from race officials to compete again, Eagle Performance 
plans to return to Le Mans next year. 
</P>
<P>
Failure, says Kazmerowski, always is integral to maximum effort. That's racing. 
Also c'est la vie. PAUL DEAN

MORNING REPORT: NEW KIDS AT TOP OF CHARTS

New Kids on the Block, a favorite of females between 4 and 15, now has the No. 
1 album on the Billboard chart. "Step by Step" stepped into the top spot in 
just two weeks. Some industry observers figured this teen vocal group was so 
hot and its fans so zealous that its album would have debuted in the Top Five 
-- maybe even at No. 1. But it entered last week at No. 14 -- remarkable for 
the average artist, but so-so for a group that's so popular. But this week the 
Kids showed that the "slow" start was just a fluke. The New Kids now top both 
pop charts. The album's title song has taken over the No. 1 spot on the pop 
singles chart. All the controversy is propelling 2 Live Crew's nearly year-old 
album back up the pop chart. This week "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" jumped from 
No. 77 to No. 54. Soul II Soul's new "Vol. II 1990: A New Decade" raced up to 
No. 21 in just three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* Heartthrob Keith Sweat's second album, "I'll Give All My Love to You," may 
push him to the forefront of the pack of R&amp;B singers who are scrambling for 
second place behind Bobby Brown. Off to a surprisingly fast start, his album 
debuted at No. 33.

YODELERS TO SOUND OFF AT CIVIC THEATRE TONIGHT 
</P>

<P>
West Coast yodelers yearning for the Swiss Alps may not have the snowy summits 
to echo their talents, but singers from 11 Swiss singing clubs will bounce 
their songs off the walls of the Civic Theatre tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of practice and technique to get the sound out there," said 
George Reber, spokesman for the San Diego Swiss Singers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a joyous expression of feelings." 
</P>
<P>
The concert, which includes San Diego yodelers Anna Sigrist and Gerda Mares, 
will showcase folk songs in Switzerland's four languages: German, French, 
Italian and Romansch, a language similar to Latin that is spoken along the 
Austrian border of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
The yodelers will pitch their voices along with a 350-member choir and marching 
bands during a two-hour show of Swiss folk music, culture and native costumes, 
starting at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The concert is part of the four-day Pacific Coast Swiss Singing and Yodeling 
Festival, which began Thursday. Held in San Diego for the first time, the 
festival for Swiss singing clubs is now in its 20th year, Reber said. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, begun in Oregon in 1935 and held every three years, is expected 
to draw Americans of Swiss descent from Oregon, Washington, Utah, California 
and Canada. In San Diego, 250 members of the San Diego Swiss Singers club carry 
on their musical heritage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The festival coincides with a yodeling festival in Solothurn, Switzerland, this 
weekend which is expected to attract about 12,000 yodelers from all over 
Switzerland, Reber said. 
</P>
<P>
A quartet of alphorn players and a zither soloist have also been invited to 
regale Swiss music enthusiasts, Reber said. The alphorn is a 10-foot long horn 
once used to send messages from one Alpine peak to another, he said. It was 
later used to call cattle. A zither is a stringed instrument played on the lap. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 11 choirs will compete during daylong festivities beginning at 11 
a.m. at Swiss Park, a private, 5-acre park in Chula Vista owned by the San 
Diego club. A barbecue dinner follows at 5:30 p.m. with dance music until 1 
a.m. by the City Police Band and the Village Street Band, both from the Swiss 
capital of Bern. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for tonight's concert at the Civic Theatre, 202 C St., are $15, $18, 
and $22 at the door, and $15 for Saturday's festivities in Swiss Park, 2001 
Main St., Chula Vista. Admission to the park after 6 p.m. is $6.

CARS: Several local dealers are among the national leaders in used car sales, 
says Auto Age magazine (D5). . . . House of Imports in Buena Park sold $25 
million worth of used cars last year, ranking it ninth in the nation. Toyota of 
Garden Grove ($12.5 million) and Jim Slemons Imports of Newport Beach ($12.2 
million) also made the top 100 list. . . . As for total cars sold (above), 
three local Toyota dealers made the top 100 list, although they're well behind

OFFICER'S TALENTS DISTINGUISHED HIM AND PUT HIM IN DANGER

<TEXT>
<P>
Tommy De La Rosa, the Fullerton police officer killed Thursday during an 
undercover operation, was a model narcotics officer, according to those who 
knew him. 
</P>
<P>
He was friendly, outgoing, experienced and cautious. 
</P>
<P>
But the talents that set De La Rosa apart also placed him in danger. 
</P>
<P>
As a bilingual officer able to easily assume the identities of drug dealers of 
many nationalities, De La Rosa was usually the one who made contacts with drug 
suspects, Fullerton Police Lt. Bud Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
And he was the one who led the way in Thursday's drug bust, during which he was 
fatally wounded in an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa, 43, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, had 
worked undercover narcotics for the past four or five years and was 
well-respected by his peers, Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
Married with four children, De La Rosa was the recipient of several awards, one 
of them as Officer of the Year, bestowed by the Orange County Latino Peace 
Officers Assn. in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, I ran into the guy who's the president of the Latino Peace 
Officers Assn. today (Thursday, prior to the ambush)," Lathrop said. "Rudy 
(Sanchez) told me there was going to be another awards banquet in August, and I 
said, 'Are you going to give Tommy another award?' and we kind of laughed about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said he was shocked when he learned of De La Rosa's death at the 
association's board meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real shocker," Sanchez said. "We kidded around, but we didn't think 
this would ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said those who knew De La Rosa called him "the man with two hats." 
</P>
<P>
"He could be a Puerto Rican one day, a Columbian the next, a Mexican the next. 
He was extremely talented," Sanchez said. "And he was always there to joke. If 
somebody was down, he was always there to help out. He fit the part of 
undercover work, like what you see in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton undercover narcotics squad De La Rosa belonged to is a 
five-member team that has won numerous awards for its aggressive work. The team 
has taken investigations as far north as San Francisco and as far south as the 
Mexican border.

Cabinet ministers hope to reverse a decision delaying construction of a Voice 
of America radio relay station for a two-year study of bird migration, 
communications officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Planning Board voted Tuesday to commission the study of bird 
migration patterns before making a final decision on the $300-million project. 
The relay station, designed to transmit VOA broadcasts to Eastern Europe and 
Africa, would be located in the Arava desert area on the southeastern tip of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel signed an agreement in 1987 to build the 
transmitter.

HALF OF SCHOOLS LACK EMERGENCY SUPPLIES

<P>
Only about half of the county's 27 public school districts have stockpiled 
enough of the emergency supplies that would likely be needed in a major 
earthquake, according to a report issued Thursday by the Orange County Grand 
Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the report concludes, the county's public schools are "reasonably well 
prepared" to handle such a major emergency. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the school districts have prepared disaster manuals outlining 
plans and offering detailed instructions to staff in the event of an 
earthquake, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee reviewed all of the manuals and found most of them to be 
comprehensive, detailed and thorough," the grand jury wrote in its report. 
"Some of the manuals . . . could serve as models for other districts." 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that more than half of the county school districts have 
trained personnel in first-aid procedures that would be needed in a major 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
The report, however, notes that "several school districts lack sufficient 
emergency supplies." Only 13 districts have all of the supplies -- ranging from 
first-aid kits to crowbars to stretchers -- likely to be needed in a major 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, only 13 of the districts had taken adequate measures to secure 
surroundings, such as bolting down television sets, computers and bookcases. 
Four districts had taken no steps to prevent such objects from hurtling across 
the room in a major quake. ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR

UPGRADING BUILDINGS FOR QUAKES WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unreinforced masonry buildings in the Main Street business district of Garden 
Grove must be upgraded to meet earthquake standards, under a draft ordinance 
unveiled this week. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was presented Thursday to the city's Parking and Main Street 
Commission, where it drew some criticism from commission and audience members 
who said it placed too much of a financial burden on property owners. 
</P>
<P>
California law requires that all cities adopt plans to mitigate potential 
hazards of old brick buildings that are not strengthened with steel rods. A 
survey of buildings in the downtown area, which dates back more than 100 years, 
identified 12 structures that appeared to pose a potential hazard in case of a 
major earthquake, according to Richard A. Peters, building services manager for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would offer owners two options in dealing with the problem. If 
owners chose not to immediately anchor roofs and walls to eliminate the most 
severe hazard -- a collapse -- all work to comply with the city's ordinance 
would have to completed with three years. However, if the anchoring was done 
within one year, the full compliance period would be stretched to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the property owner would pay for all repair work, but the 
city is considering paying up to half the cost of engineering reports. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is putting this on the city, and the city is putting this on us," 
said Tom Beem, a Main Street merchant and the commission chairman, referring to 
the expenses of studies and planning. "I feel that the city should prove to us 
that the building may be unsafe, and I feel that the city should pick up the 
soft costs." 
</P>
<P>
The total cost may be substantial, said one property owner. Dorothy Jordan, who 
owns a doll shop on Main Street, said: "I had an engineer come out and tell me 
it would cost $40,000 to bring the property up to where it would qualify for 
earthquake insurance. I haven't got that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
Beem suggested that property owners and business people who would be affected 
by the proposal work through the Main Street Merchants Assn. to ask the City 
Council to pay more of the costs involved and to help arrange low-income 
construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, if a building is not in compliance after the 
deadline, an evacuation would be ordered. Non-complying buildings could later 
be demolished. JIM TORTOLANO

CALTRANS WORKER INJURED BY DRIVER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Caltrans worker and a suspected drunk driver were injured Thursday morning 
when the driver lost control of his car on the Garden Grove Freeway east of 
Brookhurst Street, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Braun, 29, of Huntington Beach told CHP officers that he fell asleep 
while driving eastbound in the fast lane at about 10:40 a.m., CHP spokesman 
Lyle Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Braun's Chevrolet Blazer veered off the freeway toward a Caltrans equipment 
truck that was parked on the shoulder, Whitten said. Braun apparently saw the 
truck and attempted to turn his vehicle sharply left, but he struck the rear 
left side of the Caltrans vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Merrill, 30, of San Bernardino was standing on the back of the flatbed 
truck when it was hit. 
</P>
<P>
Braun and Merrill were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, Whitten said. 
Braun sustained deep gashes on his face and a broken collarbone, and Merrill 
was admitted with what could be a broken hip bone, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Braun was being held at the hospital on suspicion of driving under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs, Whitten said. Blood tests were taken, Whitten 
said, and if they prove positive, Braun will be charged with felony drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
This year, eight Caltrans workers have died while working alongside the 
freeway, Caltrans spokeswoman Gloria Carrillo said. Five of those were hit by 
motorists, she said. JAMES M. GOMEZ

PLAN LINKING POLICE, KOCM CONSIDERED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Warnings about traffic jams, crashes and detours may soon be available on the 
airwaves of station KOCM, 103.1 FM. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal by Newport Beach Police Chief Arb Campbell, the station, known 
as K-OCEAN, would become the official link between the police and the 
community, for use during local emergencies and to alert drivers to area 
congestion and collisions. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday will consider spending $2,550 to begin the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the money would be used to buy two emergency power generators for 
the station, a telephone hot line between the police headquarters and the radio 
station, and installation of six city signs at all the main routes into the 
city. The signs would tell drivers they can receive local traffic information 
on the K-OCEAN frequency. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sgt. Andy Gonis, a Police Department spokesman, the partnership 
will allow police to reduce congestion and to keep people informed in the event 
of a local emergency, such as an earthquake or large fire. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came out of a 1988 proposal that the Police Department set up its own 
low-watt public radio station. According to police estimates, such a station 
would have cost the city about $24,000 initially, plus operating and 
maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
K-OCEAN is a 2,500-watt station with an audience of about 100,000 people, 
according to station General Manager Richard Lyons. LAURA MICHAELIS

FLYING CANS SNARL TRAFFIC ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 3,000 empty soft-drink cans on their way to being recycled clattered onto 
the eastbound Riverside Freeway in Fullerton on Thursday morning, snarling 
traffic and creating a mess for Caltrans workers. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver carrying the load of aluminum cans told a California Highway 
Patrol officer that he heard a noise, checked his rear-view mirror and saw "a 
smoke screen of cans" flying behind his truck, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A pin came loose from the door latch, sending his load of aluminum to the 
asphalt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The cans temporarily halted traffic and kept two lanes of the freeway closed 
from about 8:10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. while California Department of 
Transportation workers swept the cans to the sides of the freeway. No injuries 
or damages were reported, Burrus said.

600 INTERVIEWED FOR CLUES TO GIRL'S KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators say they have interviewed more than 600 people and 
expect to talk to dozens more as they attempt to solve the gruesome slaying of 
a 9-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has set up a command post outside the Hudlund Drive 
home where Autumn Wallace was slain. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators on Thursday continued to scour the house for clues, Lt. Richard 
J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn's body was found in her bathtub last Friday by her mother, Linda 
Wallace, 42. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that Autumn was killed when one or more intruders broke 
into the Wallace home while the girl was alone. She was last seen by neighbors 
playing in front of her home in an unincorporated area between Stanton and 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn's 18-year-old sister, April, said she arrived home from work and noticed 
that several items were missing from the house, including a TV, videotape 
recorder, microwave oven and mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened, April went across the street to a neighbor's house and asked 
whether anyone had seen anything unusual. About 20 minutes later, Linda Wallace 
returned home and found her daughter's body in the back bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Since the slaying, the family has not been allowed back into the house because 
of the continuing investigation. The Wallaces have been staying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said investigators are using a laser-detection system that seeks out 
fingerprints and clothing fibers that would otherwise be undetectable. 
</P>
<P>
"How it works is that they spray something like super glue in the rooms. When 
the fumes set, they go in with laser lights to see what they come up with," 
Olson said. DAVAN MAHARAJ

BARNETT SAYS SHE'LL SEEK COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jo Ann Barnett, a longtime board member of the Anaheim Union High School 
District, has announced that she will seek a City Council seat in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, 58, has served for 19 years on both the city elementary and high 
school boards and believes that the city should be paying more attention to the 
problems of gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's about time the city recognizes that there are some gang problems 
here," Barnett said. "I think we need to put more money into the 
gang-suppression efforts." 
</P>
<P>
She would also like to bring more cohesion to the often-antagonistic council, a 
role she said she has had much experience playing in her many years as a school 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
"I can work with other people -- that's my strong point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Though she ran for the council unsuccessfully in 1982, she said she learned 
that funding is an essential part of a winning campaign. "A lot of people told 
me that if you had waged a campaign, you would have won it. So this time, I'm 
going to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett raised about $5,000 at a recent back-yard barbecue, her first campaign 
function. She expects to raise about $80,000 to $100,000 in her bid for the 
seat. LISA MASCARO

9-YEAR-OLD RECOGNIZED FOR HEROISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two months after a gun-wielding woman grabbed him from the Van Buren Elementary 
School playground, third-grader David Christie occasionally creeps into his 
parents' bedroom to get a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"He sleeps, but sometimes he gets scared and comes and sleeps on the floor of 
our room," said Les Christie, the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Christie videotaped a school assembly at which David, 9, was 
awarded a crystal plaque and a $500 U.S. Savings Bond for heroism from Westec 
Security Inc. 
</P>
<P>
David was credited with calmly negotiating his own release after being held for 
20 minutes in a park next to the school. The ordeal began as the lunch period 
was ending April 18. David and a friend were tossing a ball on their way back 
to class when the woman abducted him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her at the end if she would let me go, I'd tell the (police officer) to 
put down his weapon, and so she did," David recounted then. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Faye Reed, 30, is being held at Orange County Jail without bail, 
awaiting a pretrial hearing July 13 on charges of kidnaping, assault with a 
deadly weapon and having a firearm on school property. 
</P>
<P>
David received the award in front of 540 students on the last day of the school 
year. In the same year, the students saw the death of a classmate, Ryan 
Dedrick, 10. Ryan was killed last November in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really gone through some things," Principal Kenneth Lorge said. "Death 
is never a positive thing, and a kidnaping is never positive, but they turned 
into positive things for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
When Ryan died, the students were stunned that such an energetic person their 
age could be gone so quickly, Lorge said. They learned how precious life is 
and, with that in mind, the teachers and staff focused on the quality of the 
children's lives, encouraging them to take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
With the kidnaping, the school reinforced its safety awareness and went over 
"with a fine-toothed comb" its emergency preparedness program, Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do to prevent a crazy person from doing whatever they 
want to do," he said. "But at least from our end of it, the safety end, we know 
we've done our job." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a jittery week following the April 18 kidnaping, the school has 
recovered remarkably, Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
So has David, said his parents, who have not limited David's activities since 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after, all the parents had their children in vans, taking them to 
school," Les Christie said. "Our kids walked to school." 
</P>
<P>
"David even quoted that lightning doesn't strike twice," said his mother, 
Gretchen Christie. 
</P>
<P>
But older brother Brent, 11, said he feels more protective of David. 
</P>
<P>
"I go with him sometimes to the stores now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David politely answered reporters' questions after the ceremony and posed for 
pictures before rejoining his classmates for the last activities of the year. 
The attention he has received has been exhausting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want it to be regular because I don't want to answer any more 
questions," he said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

AGENT FOUND IN WATER KILLS PLANT POLLEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A mysterious compound found in tap water and some bottled water blocks the 
germination of plant pollen, and UC Irvine researchers want to know if the 
unknown agent could have a harmful effect on other organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Franz Hoffmann said Thursday that the effect was produced by treated and 
untreated tap water from several Orange County wells and repeated with water 
samples from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that a fundamental botanical process like pollen germination is 
inhibited by a factor in drinking water (that is) not included in water quality 
control (tests) causes some general health concern," said Hoffman, an associate 
professor of developmental and cell biology whose findings were published last 
month in the scientific journal Environmental Pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann cautioned that there is "no indication to believe there is toxicity to 
humans" from the as-yet unidentified compound. But "there is no indication 
there isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned Southern California water officials downplayed the findings as 
premature and of doubtful application to humans. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say there is a lot more research that has to be done before you can 
start making comments about toxic agents and health concerns," said Marshall 
Davis, water quality laboratory manager for the Metropolitan Water District, 
which supplies much of Southern California's drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"To imply that what affects pollen germination affects man, that seems to be 
quite a stretch of the imagination," said Ronald Young, general manager of the 
Irvine Ranch Water District, where some of the water samples were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said he and co-researchers stumbled upon the findings while doing 
genetic engineering studies on tobacco plants. 
</P>
<P>
They discovered that pollen subjected to tap water -- instead of the usual 
distilled water -- failed to germinate. The pollen grains deteriorated, and the 
culture medium became discolored even when tap water was diluted with 75% 
purified water. 
</P>
<P>
The samples used on the pollen came from wells in Irvine and Yorba Linda that 
were 20 miles apart, Hoffmann said. Since the phenomenon was first observed 2 
1/2 years ago, the same effects have been duplicated with treated and untreated 
water from across the county and even a sample from Stuttgart, West Germany.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
KEEP IT UNDER SURVEILLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seal Beach has one of the smaller police departments in Orange County, but the 
department of 42 sworn officers has had a large share of publicity in recent 
years about morale problems and internal strife. Now comes a report by the 
Orange County Grand Jury that confirms the need for attention from the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury rarely ventures into the corridors of police departments in the 
county, and is known for issuing measured findings. But after an 11-month 
investigation prompted by citizens' complaints, the jury concluded that there 
was low morale and unfair job treatment in the department, resulting from 
favoritism and nepotism. Among other things, the grand jury found that Police 
Chief Bill Stearns had hired his wife to be the department's court liaison 
officer without following procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury report amounted to a wake-up call for the city fathers, who seem 
to have been insufficiently moved in the past by complaints such as those 
considered by the jury. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the city Charter has a clause that prohibits nepotism, but City 
Manager Robert Nelson told jurors that the hiring of the chief's wife did not 
violate city or civil-service regulations because it was a job 
"reclassification,"' whatever that means. And the fact that Mayor Edna Wilson, 
when asked publicly about the report's conclusions, expressed some surprise 
about the whole thing was itself surprising. 
</P>
<P>
A far more hopeful sign was the mayor's declaration that the City Council "will 
do anything that we need to do" to comply with the panel's recommendations. 
Among them were sound suggestions that the council investigate any departmental 
conflicts of interest and institute training to reduce stress and foster team 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Small police departments have different problems from large ones. But Seal 
Beach has learned one thing they all have in common: the need for municipal 
oversight.

'SELLING OUT' BEGINS WITH INNOCENT ELBOW-RUBBING; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: IT'S EASY FOR OFFICIALS TO BE INFLUENCED WHEN THEY HANG OUT WITH 
THE SO-CALLED 'RIGHT PEOPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY GENIS, Sandy Genis is a Costa Mesa city councilwoman. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was student government day, and a group of Newport Beach high school 
students were considering a hypothetical development project at a mock city 
council meeting. A student approached the lectern and demanded that one of the 
student "councilmen" abstain from voting, charging improprieties and claiming 
to have seen the "councilman" with the project developer at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The incident added a little spark to the proceedings. Yet, sadly, it was a 
reflection of the lack of trust many people, even high school students, have in 
public officials. Unfortunately, this is not without reason. 
</P>
<P>
We read stories of investigations or arrests in blatant cases of influence 
peddling or bribery, as politicians or political contributors are led off to 
jail. Still, as an elected official and professional planner with a public 
agency, I believe that the vast majority of public officials stay within the 
law. But is that enough? If something's not technically illegal, does that make 
it OK? What about that breakfast? 
</P>
<P>
Local officials who'd be aghast if offered an outright bribe often fall prey to 
a more insidious form of influence. One is asked to go to lunch, or to join in 
a round of golf, to have answered "any questions you might have" or explained 
"where we're coming from." Few would argue that a free golf game or lunch is 
sufficient "bribe" to influence a vote, and the cost of either falls well below 
most reporting limits. But what occurs during that lunch or golf game? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the host gets a few hours, undisturbed, to "sell" his position. 
Yet, surprisingly little time is actually spent talking business. Most of the 
time is spent in extraneous chitchat, establishing a rapport. The persuasion is 
subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the subliminal movie commercials in the '50s? A picture of popcorn or 
a cold drink would be flashed on the screen so quickly that it didn't register 
in the conscious mind but affected the subconscious enough to cause a run on 
popcorn or cold drinks at intermission. That's what happens with public 
officials. They're invited to social affairs or to lunch at a nice restaurant. 
They are stroked. And between comments about the weather and the pate, oh, so 
subliminally, they are seduced. 
</P>
<P>
Don't feel holier than thou! It could happen to you, too. Picture it: 
</P>
<P>
Every day you hear from numerous constituents, most of whom have a complaint or 
a problem. It's rewarding when you're able to help, but often there's just 
nothing you can do. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people who call have never dealt with government before and have 
trouble explaining their situation. Sometimes they are angry or abusive. You go 
to a neighborhood to check things out and get a flat tire, or someone's dog 
mistakes your leg for a fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
You may not get much positive reinforcement from the public. Ninety-nine votes 
they like, and you hear nothing. One they don't, and you're pond scum. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in walks Mr. Government Relations in his $1,200 suit. He gleams with 
success. He's elegant, he's articulate, and he treats you like his friend. You, 
the one who clips coupons and scrimps to pay the mortgage. He has chosen you! 
You bask in the glow of his attention. 
</P>
<P>
You spend more and more time with "important people." Dinner here, a concert 
there. They do you little favors -- give you a lead on a contract or a great 
deal on a new car. Even better, they guide political contributors your way. 
That's just networking. No problem. Everyone does it. 
</P>
<P>
You start expecting things. You love approving new upscale restaurants and 
hotels because they have such nice opening night parties. You're invited, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Soon you're spending little time with regular folks, hearing only one side of 
the issues. You forget any other side exists, since all the beautiful, 
successful people agree on the "right positions." If you want to be truly 
beautiful and successful, then you'll have the "right positions," too. 
</P>
<P>
Some say you've sold out, but it's not true. You're just more enlightened. 
You're being taught by people who are rich and powerful -- the "right people." 
They wouldn't steer you wrong. They're your friends. 
</P>
<P>
You deny the true motive behind this "friendship." You pretend these people 
would still fawn over you even if you voted differently or recommended denial 
of a project, but you lack the courage to do so and find out. 
</P>
<P>
It happens. I've seen it happen to elected officials and to professional staff. 
There's nothing illegal about it, but it's unethical. It's also very sad. 
</P>
<P>
People should be able to trust their government. High school kids shouldn't 
have to accept influence-peddling as a fact of life -- but it is. It's so 
subtle that the person being influenced can deny it even to himself, making it 
all the more pernicious. And it all starts with a free lunch.

IRVINE FIRM A BIT OVERZEALOUS IN DESCRIBING DEAL 
</P>

Comparator Systems Corp., a tiny technology company that has been struggling 
for years to find a market for its fingerprint identification machines, would 
have had you believe that it had signed a deal with a major rental-car company 
that would provide financing to market a new generation of products. 
</P>
<P>
In a release Thursday, the company announced that it had formed a joint venture 
with Orion Systems Ltd., which it said is 52%-owned by Budget Rent-A-Car Corp., 
the Chicago-based car rental giant. In fact, Orion is 52%-owned by a licensee 
of Budget Rent-A-Car of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
And in an interview, Comparator's director of public relations, Paul Webster, 
said the deal would provide the company with $5 million to $10 million, which 
would be used to bring the company's planned ID-2 fingerprint identification 
system -- an updated version of its original product that could be used for 
credit and automated teller machine cardholder identification -- to market by 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, James F. Green, vice president of marketing at Orion Systems, said 
that the company had signed a letter of intent for a joint venture but that it 
is providing no financing. After being told of the conflicting statement from 
Orion, Robert Reed Rogers, Comparator's chairman and chief executive, said 
Webster's previous statement about the financing was in error. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that Orion Systems will assist Comparator in developing 
products for the rental-car market -- such as computerized car rental kiosks -- 
based on its fingerprint technologies. But Comparator still needs millions of 
dollars to develop its ID-2 and related products. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't getting a bloody nickel out of this," Rogers said of the Orion deal. 
"The purpose of the venture is to work with a client in the car rental industry 
to develop our biometric fingerprint system for use in the car rental 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said the publicly held company's ability to produce systems for the 
market by 1991 is contingent upon financing, and he said the deal with Orion 
would put the company in a better position to obtain capital. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended March 31, Comparator lost $1.1 million on revenue of 
about $4,000. In the comparable year-earlier period, the Irvine firm lost 
$915,989 on revenue of $46,136. 
</P>
<P>
Orion's Green said his company is enthusiastic about Comparator's product. "The 
technologies being developed by Comparator are exciting to us and will help 
them develop and market the products that relate to our industry," he said.

An expanded program of live entertainment including rock and jazz concerts, 
plays and variety shows is being planned for the summer at the 53-year-old 
Miramar Theater in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which has mostly featured surf films and occasional rock concerts, 
changed hands recently. 
</P>
<P>
Now under the management of Tustin-based Action Entertainment, the 530-seat 
Spanish-style hall will stage a "grand opening" with events July 6, 7 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
A July 6 concert will feature Pocket Venus, the Deadbeats and a band to be 
named. The next day, Beatles copy band Help will play. A variety show is being 
scheduled for the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Two "equity waiver" play productions have been scheduled: "Pvt. Wars" by James 
McClure on Aug. 2 through 5 and 8 through 10, and "Planet of the Mutagens" by 
Mary Gail Sept. 6 through 9 and 12 through 14. Casts and directors will be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
A "surf week" of films, concerts and other events, all to be announced, has 
been scheduled for Aug. 21 through 26. Meanwhile, the theater will continue to 
show surf movies and will begin showing art and foreign films as well. 
</P>
<P>
According to Xan Martin of Action Entertainment, the theater has undergone 
limited renovation and more is planned. The theater underwent extensive 
restoration in 1986.

President Bush launched a counterattack today against charges his 
Administration has reacted slowly to the savings and loan crisis, promising 
prison sentences for "the cheats and the chiselers and the charlatans." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Justice Department, Bush also said he will ask Congress to 
increase next year's spending to combat thrift fraud from the current $50 
million to $100 million in the 1991 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
For 1990, the Administration sought and accepted only $50 million, even though 
Congress had authorized $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, 
whose agencies are leading the effort to unravel the S&amp;L catastrophe, Bush 
spoke to 88 of the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys, summoned to Washington for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also announced that he is establishing a new position in the attorney 
general's office, a special counsel for financial institution fraud who will 
coordinate investigations and prosecutions in that area. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Democrats lashed out at Bush's initiative as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too little and woefully late," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a 
member of the House Banking Committee. He said that $100 million might have 
been enough for 1990 but that it is not enough for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration is now moving only because the political heat is up," said 
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Bush in his talk did not mention questions about his son, Neil, who was a 
director of the failed Silverado Savings &amp; Loan in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats have charged that the Administration has been lax in 
pursuing thrift fraud cases, partly because the Silverado collapse alone will 
cost taxpayers $1 billion and raises the possibility that the President's son 
used his director's position to benefit himself and business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, who introduced Bush as "the boss," quickly blamed Congress for some 
of the delay in thrift prosecutions. Thornburgh maintained that his prosecutors 
are making progress "despite congressional delays and funding shortfalls." 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged, "We could have been moving even more rapidly" to combat 
thrift fraud, but said Congress had delayed in providing enough money. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Justice Department secured 791 major fraud convictions last year 
involving banks and savings and loans. But there was no specific detail on how 
many of those convictions were related to the thrift disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer scoffed at some of the figures the President rattled off. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we've recovered $100 million. That's 1% of the over $20 billion lost to 
fraud. Yes, there've been 150 convictions, but there are 21,000 referrals lying 
on someone's desk and gathering dust because there aren't enough people to work 
on the case," Schumer said.

A suspected drunk driver was killed and two passengers were injured after his 
car veered off the Garden Grove Freeway in Orange, the California Highway 
Patrol said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ameilia Esteban Guzman, 25, of Santa Ana was pronounced dead at the UCI Medical 
Center in Orange at about 9 a.m. Juan Hernandez, 19, and Alfredo Becerra, 26, 
both of Orange, were hospitalized in good condition at the Western Medical 
Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred around 5:10 a.m. west of Cambridge Street, CHP Officer 
Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Other motorists reported that Guzman was driving in an "erratic manner" before 
he swerved off the highway and hit a steep dirt embankment. The 1980 Mazda 
flipped over several times, ejecting Hernandez. Guzman was pinned inside the 
vehicle, and Becerra left the scene and was later found by CHP officers at 
Western Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman died of massive head injuries, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the passengers told (officers) that the driver had at least five beers 
before he took the wheel," Johnson said.

IRAN ACCEPTS U.S. HELP; 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE DEATH TOLL HITS 35,000

Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the 
United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 
35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other U.S. 
humanitarian organizations, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with Iran," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been only rare instances of U.S.-Iranian cooperation since the two 
countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago. The United States holds Iran 
partly responsible for the continued detention of American hostages by 
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should 
contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for 
all outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government routinely channels humanitarian assistance through the Red 
Cross and other donor groups. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the Iranian message to the United States presumably was delivered 
through a third party but added that he was uncertain. Messages between the two 
countries normally are handled by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have told United Nations officials that about 35,000 people 
died in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries -- including Iraq 
-- but excluded Israel and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers in Iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by 
the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early Thursday and had a 
magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency said 6,000 people were pulled from rubble and 
airlifted from the stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an 
entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims. They gently 
fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his 
head protruding. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Red Crescent asked for help in providing shelter for 400,000 people 
left homeless by the earthquake. Offers of help came from across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll was higher than a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby 
Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 
25,000. 
</P>
<P>
In scenes shown on television, masked rescuers in white aprons pulled 
dust-covered bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of 
ice in open trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run television interviewed one middle-aged man from Roodbar, a 
mountainside village in Gilan province, who said he was sleeping when the 
temblor struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so strong," he said. "I was thrown several meters, I ended up by the 
olive trees," outside his home. "Then a big boulder hit the house. The house 
collapsed. I lost all four of my children."

U.S. DECLARES NORTHERN OWL THREATENED SPECIES; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE MAKES HARMING FOREST HABITAT ILLEGAL; PROTECTION PLAN DELAYED OVER LOGGING 
JOBS

<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today declared the rare northern spotted owl 
to be a threatened species, but held up a specific plan for protection out of 
concern for thousands of logging jobs in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The biological evidence says the northern spotted owl is in trouble," John 
Turner, head of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in announcing the owl will 
be protected under the Endangered Species Act effective July 23. "We will not 
and cannot by law ignore that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Designation as a threatened species would make it illegal to harm any of the 
owls or destroy their critical habitat without federal government approval. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of spotted owl survive in the ancient forests 
of Washington, Oregon and Northern California. An Interior Department study has 
estimated that protecting the owl would curtail logging over millions of acres 
and cost as many as 28,000 logging jobs over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe there is room in the world for both owls and loggers," 
Turner told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intent now in the Fish and Wildlife Service and throughout the 
Administration is to find a way to protect the owl with the least possible 
disruption of the timber economy of the Northwest," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said it was a "difficult and painful decision both for the agency and me 
personally." 
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced the Northwest can accommodate both logging and owls," 
Ralph Morgenweck of the Fish and Wildlife Service told members of Congress 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The formal protection plan will not be released until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue is so complex, it involves such a vast area that the consequences 
could be harsh. . . . Therefore this decision (on a management plan) couldn't 
be made without taking into consideration its impact," Interior spokesman Mark 
Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
A committee led by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas announced in April 
that the northern spotted owl has lost about two-thirds of its habitat since 
1800. The panel recommended more than 3 million acres of previously unprotected 
forests -- an area nearly as large as Connecticut -- be set aside to preserve 
owl habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973 and has been used to provide 
protection to the bald eagle and grizzly bear, among other animals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a designation of a threatened species means it is likely to 
become extinct without protection, whereas extinction is viewed as a certainty 
for an endangered species.

Nelson Mandela, symbol of black African liberation, urged the United Nations 
today to maintain sanctions against South Africa until apartheid is abolished 
and warned of danger from armed white racists. 
</P>
<P>
Calling apartheid a "crime against humanity," Mandela said, "We strongly urge 
that there should be no relaxation of existing measures. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions that have been imposed by the United Nations and by individual 
governments should remain in place." 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the U.N. Committee Against Apartheid, Mandela also issued a 
warning against white racists among civilians, the army and police in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many among our white compatriots who are still committed to the 
maintenance of the evil system of white minority domination," he said. "Some 
are ideologically committed to racism, while others fear democratic majority 
rule." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived to a standing ovation at the United Nations for what was 
generally regarded as the most important address of his U.S. tour.

CHECKPOINT CHARLIE COMES IN FROM COLD WAR ERA

<P>
Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War, 
was hoisted into history today. 
</P>
<P>
As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies 
watched, a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American, British and 
French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse 
boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a 
flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain 
one city and travel within it should be free," British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd said in a speech. 
</P>
<P>
"We always hoped that one day Checkpoint Charlie would no longer be needed, and 
now that day has arrived. At long last, we are bringing Charlie in from the 
cold," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a 
gesture of reconciliation with the Western members of the wartime alliance: 
Britain, France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit West Berlin, noted 
that the checkpoint was vanishing on the 49th anniversary of the Nazi invasion 
of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better 
in the international arena, for overcoming the legacy of confrontation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and Markus Meckel of 
East Germany also attended the ceremony. Genscher thanked Moscow for reform 
policies that had ended "a time of trouble" in Berlin and opened the door to 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer 
Charlie's exit, snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the 
crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away. 
</P>
<P>
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who emotionally challenged the 
building of the wall as mayor of West Berlin in the early 1960s, was in the 
front row of an invited audience. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, souvenir hunters ran up and snatched cobblestones that had served as 
Checkpoint Charlie's foundation.

Increased exports and strong demand for banking and tourism services helped 
Britain cut its current account deficit by $517 million in May to $2.24 
billion, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, issued by the Central Statistical Office, came as a welcome boost 
for Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major after a series of bleak 
data on the troubled British economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although May's figures showed Britain's trade balance was still well in the 
red, they showed a steady improvement in the country's trade performance, 
helped last month by record export sales of $15.4 billion.

Marc Bohan, the former designer for Christian Dior, is expected to take over as 
artistic director of the fashion house of Norman Hartnell, dressmakers to two 
generations of British royalty. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bohan appointment is sealed, as expected, he will become the first major 
French designer to head an English fashion house. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the 63-year-old Bohan would be a coup for Hartnell's 
chairman, Manny Silverman, who led a consortium that rescued Hartnell from the 
brink of bankruptcy in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bohan, a star in the French fashion world, was abruptly dismissed by Dior in 
1989 after 28 years and replaced by Italian designer Gianfranco Ferre. 
</P>
<P>
The house of Hartnell, founded in 1924 by the late Sir Norman Hartnell, has a 
prestigious past, which Silverman has said he wants to revive. 
</P>
<P>
A romantic designer who loved full skirts, embroidery and sequins, Hartnell 
designed the wedding and coronation gowns of Queen Elizabeth II and the floaty 
chiffons still worn by Queen Mother Elizabeth.

Crunch cereals, Aunt Jemima, Celeste frozen pizza, Gatorade, Rice-A-Roni, Ken-L 
Rations and Gaines-Burgers, also said it expects to report flat to slightly 
lower profits for its fiscal year ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
For fiscal 1989, the Chicago-based company reported earnings of $2.88 a share 
and sales of $4.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 results exclude results from Quaker's Fisher-Price operation, which is 
now reported as a discontinued business since the company previously said it 
would spin off the toy division to Quaker shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Quaker's efforts to shed its non-food operations follow an industry trend to 
move "back to the basics."

<P>
Personal income edged up 0.3% in May for the second straight month, but 
personal spending was unchanged from the previous month, the government said 
today in another sign of consumer caution. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health since it 
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of $4.7 trillion. The 0.3% gain follows three consecutive monthly 
advances of 0.8% and were the lowest since a 0.2% increase last September. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$3.66 trillion after seven straight months of gains, including 0.5% in April 
and 0.3% in March. But even the April and March advances were weaker than first 
thought. They were revised downward from 0.6% and 0.5% reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report follows other signs of consumer weakness including three 
consecutive monthly declines in retail sales through May. It was the first time 
retail sales had dropped three months in a row since the summer of 1981 during 
the last recession. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the difference helped improve Americans' savings rate. The rate 
-- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- rose to 6.2% following a 6% 
rate in April and a 6.3% rate in March. The March rate was the highest in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital, since funds 
thus would be available domestically for business investment. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Americans' income after taxes increased 0.2%, the same rate as 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
The key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- rose $10.3 
billion after a $16.4 billion gain the previous month.

AS HERSELF, CHER COMES UP SHORT

<P>
Watching Cher go through her pop-celebrity paces Thursday night at the San 
Diego Sports Arena, one could only wish that she would slip into something a 
little more comfortable -- like an alter ego. 
</P>
<P>
Give Cher a role to play -- the vulnerable nuclear munitions worker of 
"Silkwood," say, or even a witch of Eastwick -- and she suddenly becomes an 
artist, a conduit for stories and passions. 
</P>
<P>
Singers who treat songs the way committed actors treat their characters can be 
conduits, too. But in a lazy hour on stage, some of which she spent singing, 
Cher was interested only in spotlighting what's least substantial about 
herself: herself. Or at least that side of herself that is bound up in being a 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Cher's concert was so much like a testimonial that chicken dinners should have 
been served. It began with a five-minute, this-is-your-life video sequence that 
ranged from her baby photos to her 1988 acceptance speech for the best-actress 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-set came more video history, this time chronicling her partnership with 
former husband Sonny Bono. And, with the video screen lowering yet a third 
time, we got to see a montage of clips from Cher's acting career. 
</P>
<P>
Cher made a teasing joke early on about doing her concert "naked." For all the 
well-toned flesh she showed as she changed from outfit to skimpy outfit, Cher 
had a screen to guard her -- the image-making TV screen to which she owes her 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Cher seldom dared to stand naked in a performing sense, with only her emotive 
resources and the quality of her songs to carry the performance. In one of the 
most annoyingly cluttered uses of choreography this side of David Bowie's 
overblown 1987 "Glass Spider" tour, Cher was surrounded by seven dancers who 
rushed and swung about a scaffolded set which resembled the backstage rigging 
of a theater. 
</P>
<P>
Like the video screen, the dancers served Cher as a convenient, labor-saving 
crutch. With all that motion around her, she could afford to move at a walk. 
Consequently, she never broke a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
A complete review runs in Saturday's Calendar section.

You can't be as nasty as you wanna be if you want to sell your record albums to 
local Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Rap group 2 Live Crew's controversial, profanity-filled record "As Nasty As 
They Wanna Be," was pulled last week from the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base 
store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The album, branded obscene by a federal judge in Florida, could also be pulled 
from stores at the Marine Corps air stations in El Toro, Tustin and Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"We did sell the album, but after the stories broke about how it was obscene, 
we pulled it," said Master Sgt. George Spear, a Camp Pendleton spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Action won't be taken at the air stations until Brig. Gen. David V. Shuter 
gives the top-selling record a listen, said Staff Sgt. Gloria Nacoste, a Camp 
Pendleton spokeswoman. Shuter is commander of Marine Corps air bases for the 
Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton officials are also considering yanking another profanity-filled 
record, "The Day the Laughter Died," by controversial comedian Andrew Dice 
Clay. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Goldberg, president of Los Angeles-based Gold Mountain Records, blasted 
the action against 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't anything on that album that soldiers haven't heard during basic 
training," Goldberg said. "Personally, I am no fan of the album. But the 
government shouldn't be music critics." 
</P>
<P>
Skywalker Records, the group's Miami-based label, is appealing a June 6 ruling 
by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez in Florida that the album is obscene. 
Group members Luther Campbell and Christopher Wongwon and a record store owner 
in Broward County, Fla., have been arrested on obscenity allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Marines who can't buy the album will still have a chance to 
hear the songs from "As Nasty As They Wanna Be." 2 Live Crew has scheduled a 
concert in Los Angeles on Monday.

Home writer Martha Stewart has angered some in her hometown for refusing to 
disclose how much she raised for charity through a benefit decorator show 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The show house was open for 20 days in May to benefit the Hole in the Wall Gang 
Camp Fund, a charity for seriously ill children and their families founded by 
Stewart's Westport neighbor, Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
The show house and other events raised $210,000 for the charity, Stewart told 
The Advocate of Stamford. But she won't say how much was raised specifically 
through the house. 
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 people visited the house for $15 each, which would make the gross 
proceeds $135,000. Stewart said the house turned a profit for the camp, but 
that volunteers and visitors do not have a right to know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should give the dollar amount," Stewart said. "They all got 
$15 worth of information out of that house. Think of it this way: It's like 
going to the movies."

BRAVES FIRE MANAGER NIXON; COX IS NAMED AS REPLACEMENT

The Atlanta Braves, cellar-dwellers in the National League West, fired Manager 
Russ Nixon today and replaced him with General Manager Bobby Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Kasten, the Braves' president, made the announcement at a news conference 
at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. He also said pitching Coach Bruce Dal Canton 
will be replaced by Leo Mazzone, pitching coach with Atlanta's International 
League farm club in Richmond, Va., and Dal Canton will be sent to Richmond to 
replace Mazzone. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous strain on Russ and the players. I wanted Russ to 
succeed, but obviously it hasn't worked out," said Cox, who will serve as 
manager and general manager for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own mind, this was something that had to be done," he said. "But it's 
not a good day for me. It's rather upsetting. When somebody fails below you, 
it's the same as if you failed." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, 55, said Cox called him this morning to inform him he was being 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I've been expecting it," he said in a telephone interview from his home 
in Covington. "It's been evident the last two weeks. One of the bullets was 
going to get me, they've been shooting so many at me." 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation for days that Nixon would be fired, and Nixon 
himself acknowledged earlier this week that his job might be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"They pulled me off Death Row with that one didn't they?" he asked after the 
Braves won the second game of a double-header with the Cincinnati Reds Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, then a manager in Atlanta's minor league system, was named manager of 
the Braves in 1988 after the firing of Chuck Tanner. The club was 42-79 under 
his direction that year and 63-97 in 1989, finishing in the Western Division 
cellar both times. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves are in last place with a 25-40 record going into tonight's home game 
with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon previously had managerial experience with Cincinnati in 1982 and 1983, 
when the Reds also finished in last place. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, in his fifth season as general manager of the Braves, managed the Toronto 
Blue Jays for four seasons (1982-85) and Atlanta for four seasons (1978-81).

Tournament organizers tried to keep the favorites apart until the latter stages 
of the World Cup. Despite their best-laid plans, Brazil will play Argentina and 
West Germany will meet The Netherlands in the second round this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
If some matchups have the look of a possible championship final, others have 
the appearance of belated first-round games for fans who might have missed the 
initial 36 games of the 52-game tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon plays Colombia, Costa Rica meets Czechoslovakia and Romania faces 
Ireland in some surprising second-round matchups. (Complete schedule, C8.) 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply another result of the closing of the gap between big teams and 
the smaller nations," Colombia Coach Francisco Maturana said. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the world soccer federation, went through an intricate procedure to keep 
the top nations separated as long as possible. But sub-par performances by some 
highly rated teams upset that scheme. 
</P>
<P>
That's particularly true with the Germans and Dutch, considered among the four 
strongest teams in Europe. Some had projected them to meet in the final. 
Instead, they play Sunday at Milan. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil and Italy are likely finalists, too," German midfielder Pierre 
Littbarski said. "They are the best teams in the championship and we hope to 
avoid them before the final." 
</P>
<P>
They have done that, but find The Netherlands, the 1988 European champions, 
immediately in their path. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch and West Germans, who are bitter soccer rivals, met in the 1974 World 
Cup final, with the Germans winning at Munich. The teams played two ties in 
prequalifying matches. In 1988, The Netherlands beat West Germany in the 
semifinals of the European championships. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany has played smooth, creative soccer during the World Cup, while the 
Dutch scraped through the first round mainly on experience. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between Argentina and Brazil is as strong as that between West 
Germany and The Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil has won three matches so far, but with cool, calculated play, not flair. 
Argentina finished only third in its group and Diego Maradona has done little.

Shot putter Mike Stulce has been suspended for two years after testing positive 
for high testosterone levels, The Athletics Congress announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Stulce, 22, a junior at Texas A&amp;M, is the first athlete to test positive 
under TAC's year-round, out-of-competition drug-testing program, which began in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Stulce, the 1988 and 1989 NCAA shot put champion, was randomly selected for 
testing during the week of March 19. On April 5, TAC, the national governing 
body for track and field, was informed that Stulce's 
testosterone-epitestosterone ratio was higher than the prescribed limit of 6 to 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Under TAC's year-round, out-of-competition testing protocol, Stulce was given 
the two-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Stulce has appealed the finding. A three-member panel of TAC's Drug Control 
Review Board will hear Stulce's appeal. No date has been set for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Stulce also won his second straight NCAA indoor shot put title in March, but 
was declared ineligible by the NCAA on April 12 for violating eligibility 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Stulce was the U.S. junior shot put champion.

Los Alamitos hosts the first of five afternoon racing programs Sunday with a 
13-race card highlighted by the $110,000 Dash For Cash Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Los Al's first afternoon racing program in more than 15 years is dubbed Family 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
Children accompanied by an adult will participate in drawings for tickets to 
Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. An outdoor barbecue will be served 
accompanied by a strolling Dixieland band. The first 4,000 full-paid admissions 
on Sunday receive a free wagering voucher valued between $1 and $100. 
</P>
<P>
The Grade I Dash For Cash Derby goes as the 11th race on Sunday's program, 
which gets under way at 1:45 p.m. with the track's gates opening at noon. The 
10 finalists in the Derby earned a starting position by stepping off the 
fastest times in two time trials June 13 at Los Al. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they'll line up for the 11th running of the 440-yard Dash For Cash 
Derby (from the rail out with riding assignments): Mighty Easy Pass (Juan 
Limon, 117), Starlets Secret (Bruce Pilkenton, 117), Life Line (Ralph Seville, 
122), Newmont (Jesse Godinez, 122), Rebel Dasher (Eddie Garcia, 122), 
Ourautograph (Kip Didericksen, 122), Dashin Dee Dee (Danny Cardoza, 117), 
Chasearacer (Steve Treasure, 122), BCR A Blurr ForSure (Roman Figueroa, 117) 
and Teller Cash (James Lackey, 117). 
</P>
<P>
Ourautograph is pegged as the 8-5 morning-line favorite to capture the Dash For 
Cash Derby. After distinguishing himself among the nation's juveniles last 
year, Ourautograph underwent knee surgery late last year and has returned to 
the track in top form. The gelding raced wire-to-wire in the Laddie Handicap in 
his first start of the year for trainer Bob Baffert and then came back to miss 
by a nose in trials for the Dash For Cash Derby two weeks ago.

SUNDAY SILENCE DRAWS NO. 4 POST POSITION FOR HOLLYWOOD CUP 
</P>

<P>
Horse of the Year Sunday Silence and Criminal Type, racing's current 
giant-killer, head a field of seven entered to for Sunday's $1-million 
Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who will carry high weight of 126 pounds and be ridden by 
Patrick Valenzuela, drew the No. 4 post position. Ruhlmann, who will tote 124 
pounds and jockey Gary Stevens, will be alongside in No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic last 
year before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery in November, returned to the 
races at Inglewood June 3 when winning the $300,000 Californian by 
three-quarters length over Stylish Winner. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence concluded his preparations for the 1 1/4- mile Gold Cup's 51st 
renewal with a handy five-furlong work in :58.1 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Perfect," said trainer Charlie Whittingham. "He's in good shape for Sunday's 
race." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of over $4.5 million last year, Sunday Silence will race coupled 
with stablemate Ruhlmann, who won the Santa Anita Handicap in March while 
leading the entire 1 1/4 miles. Hollywood Park linemaker Russell Hudak has 
installed the Whittingham-trained entry as the 4-5 favorite to capture first 
prize money of $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence and Criminal Type will be confronted by the hottest horse in the 
country, Criminal Type. The Calumet Farm five-year-old upset Easy Goer and 
Housebuster in Belmont Park's Metropolitan Mile on May 28. One race previous, 
the D. Wayne Lukas-trainee upset Ruhlmann by a neck in the $1-million Pimlico 
Special. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type, a winner of $66,800 last year, already has earned close to $1.8 
million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He will be ridden by Jose Santos, who became Criminal Type's jockey prior to 
the Pimlico Special, and has been assigned 121 pounds. The son of Alydar will 
be 2-1 on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
Linesmaker Hudak made Opening Verse, 119 pounds and jockey Angel Cordero Jr., 
the field's third choice at 4-1. Opening Verse has been freshened since running 
fifth in the Pimlico Special as the 3-2 betting favorite. 
</P>
<P>
" got beat 3 1/2 lengths and never really ran his race," commented trainer 
Richard Lundy. "He needed a little break, and I think he comes into the race a 
fresh horse. He's been training real well, and there's no reason to believe he 
can't win." 
</P>
<P>
The complete field, in post position order, for the 51st Hollywood Gold Cup, 
which will be run at approximately 5:20 PDT: 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Winner (Corey Black) 113, 15-1; Criminal Type (Jose Santos) 121, 2-1; 
Santangelo (Julio Garcia) 110, 30-1; a-Sunday Silence (Patrick Valenzuela) 126, 
4-5; a-Ruhlmann (Gary Stevens) 124, 4-5; Mi Selecto (Jerry Bailey) 114, 15-1; 
Opening Verse (Angel Cordero Jr.) 119.

SECOND FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
MORE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLES FEEL LIKE KIDS AGAIN -- SO THEY START A NEW GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pitter-patter of little feet had grown into the clip-clop of big Nikes -- 
trotting out the door for college and jobs and independence. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Bill and Marilyn Bauserman's spacious Yorba Linda home seemed like a 
spacious empty nest. "We looked at each other and said, 'We're going to be all 
alone,' " recalled Marilyn, 39. 
</P>
<P>
So, 16 years after the birth of their youngest child, they decided to have a 
baby. And 17 months later, the sweet reward of that decision -- their daughter 
Ashleigh -- pitter-pats about on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
The born-again parents are not the spring chickens they were when they hatched 
their first brood. Marilyn was 21 when she gave birth to two children, a son 
and a daughter, just 10 months apart. Two decades and a full head of hair ago, 
Bill -- now 47 -- handed out "It's a Boy" cigars to celebrate his son's debut. 
</P>
<P>
That was another lifetime, another set of families. Bill and Marilyn, then 
recent divorcees, met and joined forces in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
As children go, their three didn't cause any major headaches: "None of us have 
a police record," Eric Bauserman, 20, offered as evidence. But even the best of 
children make for terminal work, excruciating worry and constant noise -- 
especially when the whole gang reaches adolescence in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Why, with freedom knocking at their door, did Mom and Dad Bauserman start all 
over again? Why not sit back and say, "We've paid our dues -- now we're going 
to enjoy the peace and quiet"? Why stretch what could have been two decades of 
child-rearing into four? 
</P>
<P>
Because, well . . . because they wanted to. "We like having kids around," said 
Bill, who owns an air-conditioning shop in Fullerton. "We'd talked about it for 
a while, but there was no way we were going to have a fourth kid with three 
teen-agers in the house." 
</P>
<P>
So they waited until they were down to one adolescent-in-residence. The last of 
the originals, 18-year-old Rachelle Strauss, leaves for college next fall. 
</P>
<P>
A 40ish couple like the Bausermans retreading the beaten path of parenthood is 
still a rarity. While the birth rate among women age 35 to 44 rose by almost 
50% from 1977 to 1987, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, 
many of those women are either first-timers or moms who did not take lengthy 
breaks between babies. 
</P>
<P>
However, Orange County obstetricians and Lamaze instructors do report a slight 
upsurge in recycled parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly occurring," said Dr. Kirk Keegan, vice chairman of the UCI 
Medical Center's department of obstetrics and gynecology. "Part of the reason 
may be that we now have technology we didn't have five or 10 years ago to help 
these women achieve pregnancy again; in some cases, they are women who had 
infertility problems after their first pregnancies. So in the years to come, we 
may see more families with a disparity in their children's ages." 
</P>
<P>
Carolou Munson, an Orange-based Lamaze teacher, also has seen an increase in 
second-time-around parents. "I've noticed it more in recent years," she said. 
"I wonder if it's an offspring of the cocooning phenomenon -- people are happy 
to spend more time at home." 
</P>
<P>
Latter-day pregnancy has an increased risk of genetic disorders. But except for 
the heightened danger of Down's syndrome, a recent study published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine showed that healthy women who bear children after 
age 34 are no less likely than younger women to have successful pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
And a study by UC Irvine obstetrician Dr. David Lewis indicates that over-34 
women who have had babies in their young 20s are likely to enjoy an easier 
pregnancy than first-time older moms. "Even a woman whose pregnancy occurs more 
than 10 years after her last delivery probably will experience the benefits of 
having already had a baby -- shorter labor and a decreased risk of Cesarean 
section," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Born-again parents are people who had to confront the empty-nest syndrome years 
before many of their generational peers, observed Lamaze instructor Munson. 
"They parented young, and now they're in their late 30s or early 40s and are 
questioning life without young ones around," she said. "They feel that they 
still have enough energy and love to devote to a second generation." 
</P>
<P>
Quite literally, the latecomers are a "second generation," with siblings old 
enough -- if not mature enough -- to be their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The (elder) children sometimes are embarrassed by their mother's pregnancy," 
said Sharron Harcarik, who coordinates the expectant parent classes at Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Center in Anaheim. "Teen-agers don't like to deviate from 
the norm, and when you're 16 it's not 'normal' for your parents to be having a 
baby. In their perception, their parents are old. Also, children don't tend to 
think of their parents as sexually active, and the pregnancy proves otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen-year-old Heather Ferneau had just heard the most outlandish news, so 
she stopped by her father's and stepmother's Dana Point house seeking solace: 
Her boyfriend's parents were expecting a baby. And they were in their, like, 
40s. And their kids were in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept saying, 'I can't believe they're doing this -- they're crazy,' " 
Heather remembered. "Finally my father said, 'Well, we can relate to that.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Her eyes got as big as saucers," interjected her dad, Bill Ferneau. He and his 
wife, Geri, 38, explained to Heather that they, too, would be welcoming a new 
bundle of joy in six months. "For the next half-hour Heather just said, 'Oh my 
God, oh my God.' " 
</P>
<P>
Heather admits that she was shocked. "The first thing I thought was, 'My dad is 
45 -- what is he doing? When the baby's 20, he'll be 65,' " she said. "You 
think things like that right off. And then you think, 'That's great -- a baby. 
They may be older, but they have more money than when I was growing up. And 
(the baby) will have seven parents (counting five adult siblings) instead of 
two.' " 
</P>
<P>
Scott Falconer Ferneau is the name of the month-old newcomer -- the first boy 
born to a family with five sisters. Bill has three college co-eds from a 
previous marriage -- Heather, 19, Carrie, 20, and Laurie, 22. Geri has Chelsea 
and Heather Drake, 16 and 19. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of marriage, Bill and Geri decided to have a baby. "It took me 
a bit longer to warm up to the notion," Bill admitted. "To parent a kid at 45 
is a fairly serious decision." 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have this baby, in another six years we'd have all our kids 
through college and we'd be footloose and fancy-free -- we could retire," said 
Bill, a representative for Dushkin Publishing Group. "The baby gives you a 
whole new set of priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Geri, on the other hand, had long hoped for another child. "I was only 22 when 
I had my second daughter, and the kids were still small when I divorced," she 
said. "I hung on to their furniture because I thought, 'Geez, if I ever remarry 
. . . .' Then it ended up in storage, and eventually my thinking became: 'Well, 
now I have this stuff to give to my kids when they have kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
As did the Ferneaus and the Bausermans, Jerry and Diana Greco planned their 
second brush with parenthood. But the Grecos' experience differs in that all 
five of their children come from one 27-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
When the youngest of their three handsome sons was 15, the Anaheim couple were 
overcome with the longing to have babies around the house again. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want an only child; we worried that he would be lonely," Diana said. 
"I was already 41, so we figured we'd better get busy." 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, they added Matthew and Melissa, now 6 and 4, to their family. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry witnessed their deliveries: "I would give anything to have the 
opportunity to redo the first three (births of his children). For the other 
boys, the hospital stuck me out in the boondocks; I didn't know if my wife was 
living or dead, for God's sake, they kept you so isolated." 
</P>
<P>
As was their parents' hope, the children appear to be best friends -- giggling 
over private jokes, sneaking one another secret hand signals, scampering off 
together when adult talk becomes too tedious. 
</P>
<P>
"At 40, we had wondered, 'What do we want to do now?' " said Jerry Greco, who 
owns Stadium Motors automobile dealership in Anaheim. "We're homebodies; we 
didn't want to travel or anything like that. So we thought, 'Let's do what we 
do best -- let's have more children.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Linda Rose definitely wanted to travel. When their daughter, Riki, took 
off for college, they took off for Hawaii and the Mexican Riviera. They also 
put a down payment on an ocean-view house with a yard too small for a swing 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Then Linda started feeling queasy. And the home pregnancy test came up 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband scrubbed their dream to buy the house. "There was no 
driveway for handball," laughed Jim, a technical representative for Toyota 
Motors. 
</P>
<P>
Having another baby at the joint age of 43 -- after purposely raising 
21-year-old Riki as an only child -- was not what the Laguna Niguel couple had 
imagined for themselves. But once they sifted through the initial befuddlement, 
Jim and Linda became excited about their surprise package -- due in August. 
</P>
<P>
"If Riki had been a difficult child, I probably would have more trepidation," 
said Linda, a vice principal for Capistrano Unified School District. "But she's 
the joy of my life. When someone has brought you so much joy, it's hard to say, 
'I don't want to go through that again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her sentiment seems common among these veteran parents: Whether by sheer luck 
or parental skill, child-rearing for them has held infinite pleasure and little 
heartache. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep marveling that out of five kids, each one has ambitions to go to 
college, none of them smoke, none of them have gotten into trouble," Geri 
Ferneau said. "We ask each other, 'What did we do right?' " 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, they did a lot right. Still, knowing now what they didn't know then, 
how might they approach parenthood differently? 
</P>
<P>
More calmly, the parents concurred. 
</P>
<P>
Geri Ferneau: "When my kids did something wrong, I tended to jump to anger 
quickly. Hopefully, I won't do as much yelling." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Rose: "As you get older, you see there are few things that are truly an 
issue -- whereas when you're young, you think everything is big stuff. I feel 
much more centered, not as emotional. I'll probably have a more relaxed kid." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Greco sounded as though he could write a dissertation on discipline: "I 
was stern with Jeff (now 26) in ways that would almost seem gruesome by today's 
standards. I was always anticipating what he was about to do wrong, I was 
always there to say, 'Don't do that, don't touch that, don't budge, don't 
move.' 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff didn't do anything goofier than these two kids, yet I have a different 
relationship with Matthew and Melissa. I'm a lot more patient with them; I 
treat them more as individuals and free spirits. If I snapped my fingers at 
Jeff, he was at full attention and pretty panicked -- whereas these two might 
look at me as if to say, 'Hey, lighten up. We haven't done anything real big 
time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hearing his father's self-critique, Jeff said he harbors no resentment about 
his strict upbringing: "My parents always had good intentions. But I think it's 
neat that they are able to relate to these two little guys in a way that is 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
Melissa and Matthew's other big brother, Chris, believes that the youngsters 
have strengthened family ties. "As kids grow up they grow apart from their 
parents -- they can't wait to leave the house when they reach 18," said Chris 
Greco, 21. "But for me, this has been an opportunity to grow closer to my 
parents. It's given me reason to spend more time around the house." 
</P>
<P>
Age brings with it not only wisdom but also a sense of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think, 'My goodness -- this child is not going to have anyone if 
we die,' " said Linda Rose. "But then I think, 'Well, our child will always 
have Riki.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her husband chuckled over her fear. "I don't know about you, but I don't plan 
on checking out any time soon," Jim Rose teased. 
</P>
<P>
Then, more seriously, he added, "The crux of it is that when you get to be 40, 
you realize you're not going to live forever." 
</P>
<P>
Recycled parents, of course, have a few more wrinkles and gray hairs than they 
did the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Ashleigh will not be embarrassed because I look older than her 
friends' dads," Bill Bauserman said. "Everyone thinks she's my granddaughter. 
We were out at a restaurant the other day and Ashleigh started fussing, and a 
man across the way said, 'She's giving you a hard time, huh, Grandpa?' That's 
the negative, but you roll with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bald spots and all, the parents have discovered a rejuvenated inspiration to 
act and think younger. "I'm watching my weight and dressing spiffier," Bill 
Bauserman said. "I guess it makes me feel sort of macho to be a new dad." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to little Scott, Bill Ferneau is determined to stay fit and active. 
"When he's 15, I'll be 60 -- and I don't want to be out to pasture," Ferneau 
said. "I'm getting to the health club more often." 
</P>
<P>
"This baby might do me a lot of good," the proud but weary father concluded 
with a laugh, "or else he'll be the death of me."

ANN CONWAY: KABUKI GALA HEADS FOR A RARE PARTY SPOT

What posh Costa Mesa sanctum costs $100,000 to join, has dues of $1,000 per 
year, and allows only cocktails, wrapped mints and salted nuts to be served to 
members? 
</P>
<P>
Five hundred Social I.Q. points if you know the answer: the 2,500-square-foot 
Center Room at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Here, arts lovers who've pledged a minimum of $100,000 (payable over a 
five-year period) gather before performances and during intermissions to sip 
libations out of gleaming German crystal. Here, members mingle against a 
backdrop of priceless 3rd-Century Syrian mosaics loaned from the J. Paul Getty 
Museum. Here, they prove that giving well is the best revenge. And it will be 
here, on June 30, that a reception -- with food -- will honor the opening-night 
performance of the Grand Kabuki Theatre of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Parties of this sort are rare for the room of the spotless plump sofas and 
silver-glinted marble tables. Only on a few occasions has it mixed members with 
non-members. There was the night that Rudolf Nureyev was feted at a reception 
when he appeared with the Paris Opera Ballet. And there was the night Beverly 
Sills breezed in to hobnob with representatives of the Steele Foundation. 
Recently, the room was the site of the formal announcement that Carl St. Clair 
was the new music director of the Pacific Symphony.

(For arts-loving trivia buffs, the Center Room is open one hour before each 
performance. It has 150 active members, about 50 less than it had three years 
ago. It's not available for rental, but the Center is considering it. And each 
member is allowed to bring only six guests per performance.) 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the invitation list for the Kabuki reception, underwritten by 
Tiffany &amp; Co., are Renee and Henry Segerstrom -- recently retired Center 
board chairman -- and members of the local Japanese community such as Mazda 
Motors Co. President Yoshinori Taura; Geors Sakioka, owner of Sakioka Farms, 
and Onoe Kuroeman II, a UC Irvine professor and former Kabuki actor who has 
been honored by his country with the title, "Intangible Cultural Asset of 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
A special guest will be New York's Faubion Bowers, aide-de-camp to Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur in postwar Japan and one of America's foremost authorities on Kabuki. 
Bowers, credited by the Japanese people with making a central contribution to 
the survival of the Grand Kabuki, will speak about the art form at South Coast 
Repertory on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany &amp; Co. was approached by the Center to underwrite the bash, which 
will include Japanese-themed fare catered by K.P. of Costa Mesa. Up for 
sampling: oodles of sushi, shrimp wrapped in pea pods, and breast of duck on 
cranberry bread with cranberry chutney -- presented on flared fans and black 
lacquer trays. Up for sipping: A Tiffany favorite, Chandon Brut. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an intriguing opportunity for us," says Tiffany Vice President Jo 
Qualls. "The Kabuki is such an unusual art form, a real Japanese national 
treasure." 
</P>
<P>
Following the performance, the Center board will stage a dessert reception for 
Kabuki supporters in its roomy Black Box Theatre, backstage. 
</P>
<P>
Partying at Casa Pacifica: Once President Richard M. Nixon's Western White 
House, Casa Pacifica in San Clemente will be the site of an Italian gala, "Una 
Bella Notte," on July 21. Party host will be Gavin Herbert, chairman of 
Allergan Inc. and a member of the Doheny Eye Institute, the gala's beneficiary. 
(Tidbit: Herbert, an owner of Roger's Gardens in Newport Beach, is helping to 
landscape the Richard Nixon Library and birthplace in Yorba Linda.) 
</P>
<P>
Singer John Raitt, father of Grammy Award winner Bonnie Raitt, will perform at 
the benefit. Pennington will cater and feature classic Italian delicacies. The 
gala is being underwritten by George and Judie Argyros of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There'll always be an England!: Maura Eggan, former marketing director of South 
Coast Plaza and new marketing director for the Carroll Group of Companies in 
London, went flat-hunting recently in Jolly Old. She saw many outlandish sights 
when she hiked in and out of a variety of flats, mostly in the form of rooms 
that seemed to have no rhyme or reason. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a note left by a proprietor that caught her eye and made her double 
up with the giggles. Herewith: "I have today installed Chubb fire extinguishers 
to the building," states Anne Morley-Lubar. "Rather than spoil the entrance 
door to each flat, I have located the equipment on the half landings between 
each floor . . . They are somewhat heavy to carry, but I feel the excitement of 
a fire would generate the necessary adrenalin to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
"There'll always be an England!" says Eggan, ecstatic about her move to Europe.

STYLE: WHETHER IN CLASSIC MODE OR SEXY, LACE HOLDS ITS ALLURE

<P>
Naughty or nice, lace is all over women's wear. 
</P>
<P>
One can find it adorning the neck of a prim Victorian blouse or stretched over 
bare skin in a sexy bodysuit. 
</P>
<P>
This season, designers have made good use of the fabric's versatility. Some 
have turned out skirts, jackets, blouses and even shorts constructed entirely 
of lace. Others add just a wisp of ornamental lace to accent a collar or hem. 
</P>
<P>
"Lace has a lot of different moods," says designer Jessica McClintock of San 
Francisco, who has made lace a trademark of her tea and party dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"I never tire of lace," McClintock says. "I find it to be the most interesting 
kind of fabric. I can always find new ways of using it, whether it's over color 
or as a see-through touch." 
</P>
<P>
Her designs feature collars, insets, hems and cuffs of Venise lace that give 
the clothes a sweet, old-fashioned look. 
</P>
<P>
The Jessica McClintock boutique in South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, Costa 
Mesa, carries her latest collection of suits made of floral tapestry fabric 
with lace collars; silky pastel dresses with wide lace collars, cuffs and hems; 
and linen suits with just a touch of lace bordering a jewel neck. 
</P>
<P>
"Lace is perfect for romantic occasions, especially weddings," McClintock says. 
"Right now it's important for just a simple cocktail dress. It's softer than 
sequins and a little easier to wear. I recently attended a fashion show in New 
York City, and one-third of the audience was in lace cocktail dresses." 
</P>
<P>
McClintock designed a simple black evening jacket covered in Alencon lace with 
rhinestone buttons down the front -- a sophisticated look for night. The jacket 
comes with a sheer black chiffon skirt and sells for $420. 
</P>
<P>
Her tan linen jacket, with cream-colored lace bordering a jewel neck and 
covering the flaps on two lower front pockets, illustrates how lace details add 
a touch of femininity to a suit. The jacket, which comes with a straight linen 
skirt, costs $255. 
</P>
<P>
As long as it's used with restraint, lace won't look frilly or girlish. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people plaster lace or frills on something so the outfit looks 
cheap, young or overdone," says Nancy Johnson, who recently opened a boutique 
at I. Magnin, South Coast Plaza. "The dresses end up like little wedding 
cakes." 
</P>
<P>
She prefers to add a touch of petit point lace around the collar of a classic 
suit, drape lace around the shoulders and the high waist of an evening gown, or 
add scallops of crocheted lace to a linen dress. 
</P>
<P>
While McClintock and Johnson cater to conservative dressers, others use lace in 
unconventional ways to please a more flamboyant clientele. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest outfit at the ENL Gallery and Boutique in Corona del Mar is a 
western-style lace shirt and pants. The shirt, for $215, is made of white 
cotton lace, except for strategically placed linen inserts on the front pockets 
and collar. For added glitz, it has rhinestone buttons down the front and on 
the cuffs and pockets. The pants, for $175, are lace with a linen lining and 
fit like a second skin. 
</P>
<P>
"They're hard to get into, but when you do, you look great," says Esther 
Leiner, manager of ENL. The outfit, by Marcy of Florida, also comes with lace 
shorts or a miniskirt and can be ordered in black. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very dramatic," Leiner says. "We can't keep it in stock. People love it 
because it's very sexy but understated. They take it on cruises or to fancy 
western parties. One woman wore it to her reunion at Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
The lace collection attracts women of all ages. Leiner sold one outfit to a 
75-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
Lace, as anyone who has seen Madonna lately can attest, may not be suitable for 
grandmothers or little girls. 
</P>
<P>
Jakeez in Irvine carries sexy styles in stretchable cotton lace that show off 
toned bodies. There's an off-the-shoulder long-sleeved top, made entirely of 
white stretchable lace that has double-thick lace panels across the front to 
keep it from revealing too much, available for $153. 
</P>
<P>
The boutique also has a black lace halter top for $109, lace leggings for $83, 
a body suit of black stretch knit with long lace sleeves and a lace back for 
$96, and a long lace skirt with small accordion pleats for $225. Customers are 
mixing up the lacy pieces with skirts, suits and blouses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a softer, romantic look," says Debbie Chuckas, manager of Jakeez. "Now 
the play is on legs, and by wearing something like lace leggings, you're 
covered, but it's still sexy." 
</P>
<P>
Some see lace as part of an overall trend toward the softer, more relaxed looks 
that have kicked off the '90s, a rebellion against constricting pinstripe 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for women to come back and be feminine," says Jan West, area manager 
for the five Westminster Lace stores in Southern California, including the 
South Coast Plaza store and a new store in Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"Lace makes you look like a lady. We all work, but it's nice (if you're wearing 
a suit) to have a little lace in the pocket or a camisole showing." 
</P>
<P>
The shop has Victorian-style blouses of white cotton or linen with high necks 
and lace medallion insets, white linen skirts with hems bordered in bobbin 
lace, suits with jackets that have scalloped necklines and hand-embroidered 
cutwork and cotton lawn dresses with elaborate cutwork on their capped sleeves 
and hems. Some of the dresses are copies of antique styles. 
</P>
<P>
"They're timeless," West says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the latest fashion trends have added to the popularity of lace, the 
ornamental fabric has been prized since its appearance during the Renaissance. 
In 16th-Century England, cutwork lace was so greatly valued that Mary Tudor 
forbade anyone below the rank of baron to wear it. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Lace imports its handmade lace from 24 different countries, 
according to West. 
</P>
<P>
Handmade lace has a subtle, uneven texture that makes it more desirable than 
machine-made lace. 
</P>
<P>
"The eye automatically registers when something is finely made. It sees the 
tiny stitches and imperfections," Johnson says. "It's the difference between a 
fine oil painting and a print." 
</P>
<P>
Because they're using lace in such great quantities, however, many designers 
including McClintock and Johnson supplement handmade lace trims with less 
expensive Venise, considered the best of the machine-made varieties. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a big change in the lace industry," McClintock says. "The equipment 
has been updated. Now American domestic lace has improved to the point that 
it's perfectly rich-looking." Ninety percent of the lace used in her designs is 
now produced in the United States, 10% is made in France. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest lacy looks, designers who have long been loyal to lace say 
it will never go out of style. 
</P>
<P>
"Fads come and go, but lace itself is classic," Johnson says. "It's an art 
form, so it will continue forever."

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: SCHOOL OF ARTS ADDS CLASSES IN ITS 4TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County High School of the Arts has a few openings left for its 
fourth year of visual and performing arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment will be expanded from 250 to 300 for the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The school is also adding a jazz combo to the music department and a commercial 
dance program to the dance department. 
</P>
<P>
The combo will play a variety of music, including the accompaniment for the 
school's musical theater productions. The commerical dance program will be led 
by TV and music video choreographer Rey Lozano, who most recently worked with 
Paula Abdul choreographing the 1990 Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The school's other program offerings include: 
</P>
<P>
The classical dance program, which is affiliated with the Joffrey Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Visual arts program, which the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana has adopted in a 
mentoring relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Instrumental music program, which plays host to the South Coast Symphony Youth 
Orchestra. Technical theater program, which stages about 50 performances a year 
in the Margaret Webb Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Musical theater program, which stages two major productions each school year. 
"West Side Story" and "Into the Woods" are scheduled for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The programs offer high school students comprehensive training in the visual 
and performing arts. There are no tuition charges. Most faculty members are 
working professionals in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
The school is situated on the Los Alamitos High School campus. All arts school 
classes meet in the afternoon, so that students need not be enrolled at Los 
Alamitos to participate. 
</P>
<P>
To schedule an audition or to receive more information, call (213) 596-1435.

DWINDLING HOUSING VACANCY

Despite a 21% increase in the number of dwellings since 1980, housing 
availability is a losing battle in Orange County. Just 3.14% of housing units 
here are currently vacant, compared to 4.89% 10 years ago. Sixteen cities plus 
the unincorporated areas all have vacancy rates lower than the countywide 
level. And nine (plus the unincorporated) have rates lower than 2% -- the 
lowest being Fountain Valley's 1.07%. 
</P>
<P>
Not all markets are drying up, however; some cities have higher rates than they 
did 10 years ago. Laguna Beach, with the highest vacancy rate outright (a 
comparatively stratospheric 13.25%), has the largest positive increase compared 
to 10 years ago, 3.51%. The vacancy rates in Yorba Linda, La Palma, San Juan 
Capistrano and Villa Park have also increased compared to 1980. Here's how the 
cities compare today, listed from smallest to largest vacancy rates:

AUSTRALIA'S MIDNIGHT OIL ADDS A BIT OF ROMANCE, BUT HEART OF ITS MESSAGE IS IN 
GLOBAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midnight Oil may be the only rock band that could insert one of the world's 
most prevalent pop cliches into a song -- "I can't live without your love" -- 
and seem enigmatic rather than merely trite. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian band, which plays tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, has 
staked its identity on bristling, hard-edged protest rock. When Midnight Oil 
isn't lashing out against nuclear arms buildups, corporate greed and 
environmental ruin, it usually can be heard sounding stirring anthems full of 
embattled resolve and faith that a change is indeed going to come. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as something as a shock, then, to hear Peter Garrett, Midnight Oil's 
imposingly tall, shaven-headed singer, moan "I can't live without your love" in 
the middle of "Shakers and Movers." In other respects, the track from the 
band's current "Blue Sky Mining" album is a true-to-form Oils lamentation that 
decries the paving-over of natural riches in the name of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking over the phone from Los Angeles this week, Garrett tried to clarify 
the band's uncharacteristic use of the L-word. 
</P>
<P>
"It's used in a dual sense, I think," the 6-foot-6 singer said in a gravelly 
but gently modulated voice. "It's used in the classic emotional sense, but also 
in the sense of the embrace of the planet which keeps us alive." 
</P>
<P>
Midnight Oil's love-pledge to the earth still places it far from the romantic 
sentiments that are the foundation for most pop songs. That sets Midnight Oil 
apart, but the band's reluctance to delve into one-to-one relationships also 
has kept it from tapping into a deep fount of emotion. Some of the most 
thoughtful rock songwriters have achieved deep political resonances by setting 
romantic, person-to-person love within a wider social frame. Bob Marley's "No 
Woman, No Cry" is a particularly inspired instance; Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" 
is a more recent textbook example of how well a song can work when romantic 
love is woven into a social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
While Garrett says that Midnight Oil would like to expand into songs that 
examine love in a more personal sense, the way in which love has so often been 
abased and turned into a pop cliche gives him pause. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always something you have to be careful about. There's so much devalued 
use of the word, and when you use it, you want to use it well. The challenge is 
to give the word meaning again. You can do it with committed performance." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we'd love to write a 'No Woman, No Cry,' but it's not that easy to 
do," he added with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, 37, said there was no decisive, revelatory experience or event that 
set Midnight Oil on course to become a town crier among rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a gradual dawning over time that there were things going on that 
were being perpetrated by politicians that didn't make sense to me or the band, 
and we started writing about them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Rob Hirst and guitarist Jim Moginie have been more prolific than 
Garrett in writing Midnight Oil's repertoire of broadsides. But Garrett has 
served as the band's point man, both as an eye-catchingly dynamic on-stage 
figure and an activist offstage spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer as well as a rocker, Garrett ran a credible but ultimately 
unsuccessful campaign in 1984 as the Nuclear Disarmament Party's candidate for 
the Australian Senate. When Midnight Oil first toured the United States in 1984 
and 1985, Garrett recalled, it met pockets of resistance to its steadfast 
seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the height of Reagan's popularity: 'America is great, we're doing 
wonderfully, don't worry.' Some shows we did, people were throwing things, and 
yelling, 'Who the hell are these guys?' or 'Get off' or 'Lighten up.' That's 
only three shows in 3,000, but it did happen, and it was good for us, too. It 
made us more determined." 
</P>
<P>
There is little danger of that happening now. Midnight Oil broke through to 
mass success in 1988 with "Diesel and Dust," a superb album inspired by the 
band's travels in the Australian Outback. Like all of Midnight Oil's albums, it 
was full of references to people, places and issues that are specifically 
Australian. But in centering on the plight of Australia's threatened 
Aborigines, "Diesel and Dust" was hardly arcane or parochial. The big scale and 
palpable passion in the performances made it clear that Australia was a 
microcosm for the entire globe. In songs such as the band's breakthrough hit, 
"Beds Are Burning," it was clear that the precarious state of Aborigine culture 
was emblematic of the endangered state of all humanity. 
</P>
<P>
Coursing through "Blue Sky Mining" is an optimism, or at least a fervent, if 
beleaguered faith, that humanity can overcome greed and division and save 
itself. "One Country" offers a Utopian vision of world unity. At the end of the 
environmental disaster song, "Blue Sky Mine," a cleansing rain comes out of 
nowhere to restore a scarred landscape in an echo of T.S. Eliot's "The 
Wasteland." 
</P>
<P>
To Garrett, what seems to be a leap of faith is actually a form of pragmatism 
that can lead to earth-saving action. 
</P>
<P>
"It is highly idealistic, when you look around you, to even start talking that 
way," he said of the quasi-religious vision in "One Country." 
</P>
<P>
"But it is highly necessary. Human survival depends on us looking after our own 
and each other." 
</P>
<P>
Any band that sings out against corporate powers, yet enjoys mass success in a 
corporate business, is going to have to face up to ironies -- even a band as 
forthright as Midnight Oil. 
</P>
<P>
There's more than a little irony in a band skewering the "great god of 
development" in "Shakers and Movers," yet playing a concert that, if 
financially successful, will benefit one of America's wealthiest real estate 
developers, Donald Koll, the majority shareholder in Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. That's one instance of how the pure, clear lines that Midnight 
Oil draws in its performances must inevitably become blurred in real life. But, 
as Garrett pointed out, the alternative to going out in the world and risking 
ironies and inconsistencies is to live an ascetic life of isolation: "You can 
sit in an ashram on top of a hill, playing your music to 20 people." 
</P>
<P>
It's also important to remember that the glory of the political pop song is its 
ability to cut through all ironies and inconsistencies for a brief moment and 
convey the intensity of emotion underlying a vividly stated point of view. 
Regardless of how many qualifications, contradictions and compromises would 
enter the picture if its songs' premises were subjected to the back-and-forth 
debate of actual politics, Midnight Oil creates pop-political moments that hit 
with undeniable impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to claim any great insight or importance in the process," Garrett 
said of Midnight Oil's role in affecting the issues it raises with its music. 
"We just want to claim our views are real and tangible, based on our own 
experiences. We're just trying to have our own voices, to express our own 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Midnight Oil and Hunters &amp; Collectors play tonight at 8 at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre on Irvine Center Drive in Irvine. Tickets: $19.50 to $21.50. 
Information: (714) 855-8096.

POLITICS: RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION POURS FROM KEVIN P. PHILLIPS' WRITING. CLASS

<P>
Think of Kevin Phillips as the Karl Marx of the Great American Middle Class. 
</P>
<P>
When Middle America felt itself under attack from hippies and limousine 
liberals, from social engineers and cop-haters, Kevin Phillips was there to 
turn adversity into strength -- the electoral strength of Richard Nixon, whom 
he hailed as the voice of real Americans and helped to victory in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the 1969 book that secured Phillips' reputation when he was only 29, 
he predicted "The Emerging Republican Majority." Twenty-one years later, after 
a resurgence of conservative political thought and a series of GOP presidential 
landslides, the Phillips prediction still looks pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
What defies prediction is Phillips himself. 
</P>
<P>
How many conservative Republicans do you know who condemn former President 
Ronald Reagan and his era for creating "a new plutocracy," for leaving America 
with "too many stretch limousines, too many enormous incomes and too much high 
fashion?" So writes Kevin Phillips in his new book, "The Politics of Rich and 
Poor" (Random House). 
</P>
<P>
Phillips talks that way, too, punctuating his sometimes donnish sentences with 
reference upon reference to the conspicuous consumption of the leisure classes. 
"You can't just let the resources that were redistributed in the 1980s sit in 
the hands of people who subscribe to Yachting magazine and Architectural 
Digest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the heyday of the proletarian writers of the 1930s has an author 
taken so much pleasure in bashing the rich. In his book, Phillips savages 
"Calvin Coolidge birthday parties hosted by parvenu GOP Washington lobbyists 
and consultants happy to tell attending gossip columnists the price of their 
new Savile Row suits." 
</P>
<P>
You would think Phillips' new book would be as welcome in Republican circles as 
a homeless socialist at one of those glittering Reagan-era soirees. 
</P>
<P>
But conservatives have become inured to Phillips and his continuing, or 
evolving, apostasy. More than a decade ago, William F. Buckley Jr.'s National 
Review branded Phillips' ideology "country and western Marxism." Phillips liked 
that so much he quoted it proudly in his 1982 book, "Post-Conservative 
America." 
</P>
<P>
The label is apt for a man who defends the interests and values of Middle 
Americans with the same enthusiasm Marx mustered on behalf of 19th-Century 
industrial workers. 
</P>
<P>
Class anger, in fact, is the key to understanding the consistency of Phillips' 
world view. And though he's not part of the angry middle class, he's definitely 
angry -- no less in 1990 than he was in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Back in those days, the elitists he loved to hate lived in places such as 
Cambridge and Hollywood, and their condescension to Middle America was 
cultural. His new villains look down their noses, he tells us, from such places 
as "Rodeo Drive, Sutton Place and the Florida Gold Coast." Their standard of 
superiority isn't culture. It's money. 
</P>
<P>
In an age when most Democrats believe that stirring class resentment is 
dangerous -- and, in any event, just isn't done -- here is a serious political 
analyst whose book is chock-full of lists of billionaires and the annual 
salaries of the country's best-paid lawyers and investment bankers. Righteous 
indignation pours from Phillips' pages. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips acknowledges he is a highly unlikely Populist. He wears monogrammed 
shirts and conservative pin-striped suits. He drives a Jaguar. Although he 
publishes a well-regarded political newsletter, he draws a big chunk of his 
income from a newsletter for business executives and from a busy schedule of 
speeches to business groups. 
</P>
<P>
His opposition to huge budget deficits, Phillips notes, is an orthodox GOP 
position -- pre-Reagan. It is the Republicanism of Bob Dole, for whom Phillips 
in the 1988 primaries voted over George Bush, whom he disdains as a symbol of 
the old-school-tie Republicanism of Round Hill Road. 
</P>
<P>
When Phillips attacks educated elites, he speaks as an insider. He graduated 
from Colgate and (like Michael Dukakis, whom he eviscerates in his book) from 
Harvard Law School. But even at Harvard in the 1960s, he insists, his 
Republicanism had an anti-elitist cast. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that the Harvard Republican Club contained all these kids from 
unfashionable places," he recalls. "All the kids in the Democratic Club were 
the sons of New Deal lawyers who had "III' after their names. Well, that wasn't 
the way it was supposed to be, but it was telling us something." 
</P>
<P>
To understand what makes Phillips tick, you have to hear how almost any 
discussion on almost any subject winds back to migration patterns, voting 
history and political geography. This is a man who loves data. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is an especially successful example of a common type in American 
politics: the young political numbers junkie whose obsession endures into 
adulthood. In his case, the lure of numbers took hold when he was 13 or 14. He 
found treasure troves of "crumbling old World Almanacs" in old bookstores on 
Fourth Avenue in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a subway ride from the 
middle-class Parkchester neighborhood in the North Bronx where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
World Almanacs are to election freaks what old baseball cards are to baseball 
fans: a source of almost limitless statistics. They include results of 
Presidential elections county by county, and, if you want to follow voting 
through the years in Dixie County, Fla., Charles Mix County, S.D., or Deer 
Lodge County, Mont., all you need is a large almanac collection. 
</P>
<P>
Young Phillips took his collection and started drawing maps, especially 
political maps. His father, a top official at the New York State Liquor 
Authority and a registered Republican, had doubts about Kevin's obsession. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time he was 15, Phillips had graduated from maps to real elections. 
His North Bronx congressional district was one of a handful in New York City 
represented by Republicans. After school and on weekends, Phillips mounted a 
sound truck and, as he tells it, he would "warm up the crowds" before Rep. Paul 
A. Fino spoke. 
</P>
<P>
His experience in the Bronx gave him an intuitive feel for the rhythms of urban 
politics and, in particular, the import of ethnic voting. He came to understand 
which groups could coexist or collaborate, and which simply couldn't stand each 
other. That education would serve him well. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips may have understood the various ethnic groups better than they did 
themselves because he really wasn't part of any of them. In a borough full of 
Italians, Irish, Jews, African Americans and Puerto Ricans, Phillips was a 
mixture of Scotch-Irish, English and Welsh. In a city where religious loyalties 
had political implications, his family -- Catholic on one side, Protestant on 
the other -- rarely went to church. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1964, went to work as 
Fino's administrative assistant. And he kept drawing political maps. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, while most Republicans still wondered if the party would recover from 
Barry Goldwater's crushing defeat by Lyndon Johnson, Phillips saw an "emerging 
Republican majority." His ideas caught the attention of influential party 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1966 midterm elections produced large GOP gains, Phillips became a 
minor prophet, the articulate young man with the charts, graphs and maps. The 
Nixon campaign decided it had to have him, and signed him up in Summer, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
To liberal Republicans, then a force to be reckoned with in the party, 
Phillips' approach was an outrage; they saw him as rationalizing white backlash 
against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Phillips believed that poor Southern whites and Northern big city 
ethnics were poised to flee the Democratic Party. In "Nixon Agonistes," Garry 
Wills quoted a young Phillips who spoke with a candor that eluded many GOP 
strategists: "White Democrats will desert their party in droves the minute it 
becomes a black party. When white Southerners move, they move fast." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was Phillips credited with developing the much-maligned (by liberals) but 
seemingly effective GOP "Southern strategy." 
</P>
<P>
To liberals, Phillips was moving the party away from Abraham Lincoln -- and 
toward George Wallace. Though Phillips says he supported the Civil Rights Acts 
of the mid-1960s, he clearly saw the white South as the GOP Promise Land. 
"We'll get two-thirds to three-fourths of the Wallace vote in 1972," he told 
Wills; as with so many other matters electoral, he was right. 
</P>
<P>
When "The Emerging Republican Majority" was published during Nixon's first year 
in the White House, it became the electoral Baedeker of GOP politicians; it 
remained so for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The book sealed Phillips' reputation as a political sage, but doomed his career 
as administration insider. He had taken a job as a special assistant to Atty. 
Gen. John Mitchell, "but when the book came out, I was sort of unplugged," he 
says. He left the Justice Department in March 1970. "I'm very glad that I did," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips set off on his lucrative career as a commentator and writer and never 
returned to government service. 
</P>
<P>
After the Watergate debacle, Phillips became increasingly unhappy with the 
Republican Party and the old conservative movement. His Populism in full fury, 
he denounced the Old Right as "elitist." As the 1976 Presidential elections 
approached, he washed his hands of Gerald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller, and, 
ever the contrarian, called for a ticket of Reagan and Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Phillips' earlier enthusiasm, it didn't take long for President Reagan 
to disappoint him. Phillips' 1982 book "Post-Conservative America" was a 
mournful view of an America haunted by "End of Empire frustration." Far from 
being a "revolutionary conservative" of the sort Phillips was seeking, Reagan 
had given the nation a "nostalgic restoration," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips insists his relentless opposition to elites has nothing to do with his 
psychological makeup and everything to do with his view of America. 
</P>
<P>
America, to Phillips, is its middle class, which he says is now threatened not 
by bureaucracies but board rooms: "It's important for people to realize how 
much (money) a small group of Americans made while most people were treading 
water and while the U.S. was losing so much internationally."

SECRET BEHIND THE MASK; 
</P>
<P>
A FORMER UMPIRE DISCUSSES ONE OF HIS LIFE'S TOUGH CALLS: BEING GAY AND IN PRO 
BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"You've got to have the guts to be hated." -- Bette Davis quoted in the preface 
to "Behind the Mask: My Double Life in Baseball" 
</P>
<P>
Dave Pallone was one of the most hated umpires in the history of major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the majors as a "scab" during the 1979 umpires' strike, made 
headlines after an infamous scrape with Pete Rose in 1988, and once became so 
angry at the St. Louis Cardinals that he ordered the entire bench into the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
In his memoir "Behind the Mask: My Double Life in Baseball" (Viking), which hit 
the book stores this week, Pallone writes: "I was willing to be controversial 
and disliked." 
</P>
<P>
He still is. 
</P>
<P>
In "Behind the Mask," Pallone reveals that he is gay, and he writes about the 
stringent measures he took, during his 10 years in the major leagues, to hide 
his homosexuality. He writes that he had a brief affair with a player during 
that time, and that he knows several others players now in the majors who are 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
He does not name names. "I do not believe in 'outing,' " Pallone said. "It's 
not my role to tell anyone on Earth how to live their life, because I don't 
want anyone telling me how to live mine." 
</P>
<P>
But Pallone himself was outed during an investigation of a male sex ring in 
1988. Even though no charges were ever filed against him, the baseball 
establishment, he claims, forced him out of the game simply because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
"My book is about a little boy who dreamed of being in baseball, got his dream, 
and then had it taken away from him," said Pallone, 38, as he settled into a 
sofa in his sparely furnished Marina del Rey apartment. Given his reputation, 
it's no surprise that when he talks about his experiences in baseball, his 
anger is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
But so is his love for the game. On one shelf of a living-room cabinet, behind 
a sliding-glass panel, are about a dozen neatly arranged, signed baseballs, 
each on a little pedestal. Nearby are framed pictures, the most prominent of 
which is of Rose getting the hit on Sept. 8, 1985, that tied Ty Cobb's mark of 
4,191 career hits. 
</P>
<P>
Pallone is in that picture, too. He was the home-plate umpire that day. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Pallone had some career," he said with a smile, "but all those years I 
couldn't be myself. I couldn't be the Dave Pallone I wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
The legendary hothead of umpires folded his hands across his chest. "I think I 
had the guts to be hated. But I didn't have the guts to be true to myself." 
</P>
<P>
Pallone didn't grow up with dreams of one day becoming an umpire, but an injury 
to his shoulder in high school put an end to his hopes of playing pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even consider a career as an ump until, in the summer of 1970, he was 
watching a baseball game on television and heard an announcement about the 
Umpire Development Program in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
His father, to whom "umpire" meant "bum," was not crazy about signing the 
permission form Pallone needed to enroll. Pallone writes in the book that he 
pleaded with his father, "Dad, it's a way I can be in baseball and maybe have a 
future, too." 
</P>
<P>
But the future for umpire candidates was -- and is -- about as bright as the 
future for young opera singers: the aspirants are many, the paying jobs few. In 
1971, when Pallone applied to the umpire program, there were almost 1,200 other 
applicants. Only 60 were accepted and of those, only 30 eventually got jobs in 
professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Of those 30, only three, including Pallone, made it to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
It did not seem likely, however, during Pallone's eight grueling seasons in the 
minor leagues, that he would ever make it to the majors. He gained a reputation 
as a hothead early on. Indeed, Pallone would throw a player out of the game for 
showing the slightest sign of disrespect. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned early that baseball players will take advantage of you if you let 
them," Pallone said. "They will eat you alive." 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that on many occasions, he overreacted. "I had a temper that 
was second to none, I guess. It had a lot to do with the turmoil I was going 
through in my double life." 
</P>
<P>
Pallone realized in high school that he was attracted to other men. But, as he 
recalls in the book, the thought that he was homosexual was so alien to him 
that he made no contact with the gay world while he was in the minors. "I had 
not been to a gay bar," he writes, "I never thought about it, didn't know if 
they existed, wouldn't have gone if they did." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1978, when he was in Puerto Rico to umpire in a winter baseball 
league, he became romantically involved with a man he met while jogging on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
His first gay affair was brief; shortly after they met, Pallone was fired from 
the Puerto Rican League for not being available to officiate at a game where he 
was listed as the substitute. Pallone, who was in Boston on a brief vacation on 
the day of the game, chalks it up to an honest mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
After the firing, the minor leagues did not offer him a summer contract. 
Pallone would have likely been out of the game for good, except for a bit of 
baseball history that changed his life. During the 1979 season, for the first 
time ever, the major-league umpires went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Pallone said he agreed with the aims of the strike, which mostly had to do with 
wages. At the time, a first-year umpire in the majors was making less than 
$18,000 a year. But when the call came for him to go into the big leagues as a 
substitute, he felt he would never get the chance again and he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
If he thought the pressure was unbearable in the minors, it was a square dance 
compared to what was to come. The players, he felt, tried to take advantage of 
his situation, challenging many of his calls. "They were trying to show that I 
didn't deserve to be there," Pallone said. "I had to show them and the fans 
that I would not take their crap. I had to be in control of the game." 
</P>
<P>
During one game in St. Louis he felt so under siege after a controversial call 
that he cleared the Cardinal bench, forcing all but the starting nine, manager, 
coaches and trainer into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
When the union umpires settled their strike and returned, things only got 
worse. The umpires considered Pallone, and the other seven umps hired during 
the walkout, to be scabs who prolonged the strike. Most of the veteran umps 
would speak to new hires only when absolutely necessary. The union men would 
not stay in the same hotel, and they spent their own money to rent cars so they 
would not have to ride to games with Pallone in the crew car. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one four-year period, when Pallone was teamed with two sympathetic 
umpires, he was isolated inside his dream profession. 
</P>
<P>
At least he was coming to terms with his personal life. In late 1979, he fell 
in love with a college student he calls Scott (several of the names in "Behind 
the Mask" are aliases). Their relationship gave Pallone great solace at a 
difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
But it ended in a tragedy. In 1983, Scott was killed when his car was struck by 
a drunk driver. Pallone's grief was multiplied by the fact that he had kept the 
relationship secret and he felt he could not discuss his loss with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship did bring him to an acceptance of his homosexuality. 
Eventually, he quietly began to strike up friendships with other gay men and to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
His career continued on its contentious path until the 1988 season. Then the 
roof really fell in. On the night of April 30, at a Mets-Reds game in 
Cincinnati, the score was 5-5 in the top of the ninth with two out. Pallone 
called Met hitter Mookie Wilson safe at first on a wide throw and Pete Rose, 
manager of the Reds, was out of the dugout like a shot to protest the call. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers flared and Pallone eventually threw Rose out of the game. Nothing 
unusual about that. Then, when Pallone's back was turned, Rose pushed him. It 
wasn't a big push, but manhandling an ump in any form is one of the most 
serious infractions in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The fans, who worshiped Rose, went nuts, throwing everything from beer bottles 
to a large boom box onto the field. Pallone writes that he feared for his life, 
although the other umpires in the game refused to halt play. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the talk of the sports world over the next few days. Rose 
defended his actions, saying Pallone had poked him near the eye before the 
push. (In his book, Pallone strenuously denies this.) But Pallone said he 
respects Rose for not fanning the fires of public fervor against him. Rose was 
quoted in a newspaper interview as saying, "Hey, Dave's a very good umpire. He 
just made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Pallone received numerous death threats and hate mail. 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark decision for baseball, commissioner Bart Giamatti suspended Rose 
for 30 days (the longest suspension doled out since 1947) and fined him $10,000 
for the shove. 
</P>
<P>
It was not widely known, before Pallone wrote about it in his book, that 
Giamatti also fined Pallone $100 for losing his cool during the Rose incident. 
Pallone, who adored Giamatti and thought of him as a father figure, protested 
the fine. He said it should be higher, and they agreed on $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pallone poured out his heart to Giamatti at that meeting, telling him that his 
legendary temper was a result, in part, of the fact that he felt he had to live 
a double life. He told Giamatti he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, Pallone writes, didn't even flinch. He told Pallone: "I am not 
concerned about it -- as long as it doesn't interfere with the game, itself." 
</P>
<P>
Two months after that meeting Pallone was back in Giamatti's office and this 
time, the atmosphere was far less friendly. The umpire was told that his name 
had come up in a police investigation in Upstate New York. Shortly thereafter, 
Pallone found out it was an investigation of a gay teen-age sex ring. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti asked him to quietly take a voluntary leave while the investigation 
continued and Pallone reluctantly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Pallone writes that he told police he had once briefly met two of 
the men who were being investigated for their alleged roles in running the 
ring. But he emphatically denied any involvement or knowledge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations hit the newspapers with headlines such as "Report Links Ump 
Pallone to Sex Scandal." No matter what the outcome of the investigation, he 
knew that his sexual orientation was now public knowledge, or at least up for 
public speculation. 
</P>
<P>
That was distressing to him at first, he writes, and then a huge relief. "Now I 
don't have to hide anymore," he realized. "Now I'm free." 
</P>
<P>
After several months, the investigation on Pallone was closed, with no charges 
filed. But he was no longer in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti refused to renew his contract, listing the alleged sex scandal and 
other factors, including his rating as an umpire, which was low for 1988. 
(Pallone attributes this to the Rose incident.) 
</P>
<P>
Pallone was furious, believing the real reason his contract was not renewed was 
because the baseball establishment could not tolerate a gay man in the game. He 
does not, however, blame Giamatti, whom he believes was forced by team owners 
to take action. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize he was being paid by the team owners. He was their 
employee," Pallone said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's just like what he said that when he talked about Pete Rose. 'No one 
man is bigger than baseball.' He believed it was in the best interest of 
baseball to have me out." 
</P>
<P>
Pallone considered suing to try to get his job back, but eventually a 
settlement was negotiated. He received one year's salary and an additional sum, 
the amount of which he will not reveal. 
</P>
<P>
When Giamatti died last year, his widow arranged for Pallone to be invited to 
the memorial service and the printed invitation has a prominent place among the 
other mementos in his living-room cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Pallone is now on a nationwide tour to promote the book. When that is done, he 
hopes to pick up a few speaking dates through a lecture agency that has signed 
him. "My goal is to become a good spokesperson for the gay community," he said. 
Some of his views, however, might offend part of that community. In the book, 
he is disdainful of effeminate men. "If I'm with a friend today and I see a gay 
man who's extremely effeminate," he writes, "I'll remark, 'I think he goes home 
and practices.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pallone said he is not offended by effeminate men, but believes they are 
furthering an unfortunate stereotype. "I want to help get rid of the myth that 
gay men are just hairdressers, or part of the arts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the topic to which he brings the most passion in conversation is his first 
love -- baseball. 
</P>
<P>
And Dave Pallone looks at the baseball establishment and cries foul. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball calls itself the American game," he said, "but baseball 
discriminates. No one is going to tell me there are not gays and lesbians who 
love baseball, because I know many of them and they contribute a lot of money 
to the game because they love it. Baseball can't say these people are not 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
He also points out that most baseball stadiums are built at least partly with 
public funds. "That includes gay taxpayers who are paying for these stadiums," 
he said. "So how can baseball be two-faced and say, 'We do not accept gay 
people in our game, but we will accept their tax dollars to build our 
stadiums?' " 
</P>
<P>
What he most wants to get across is that he believes gays and lesbians should 
not have to live a double life, in sports or any other walk of life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not until now, 1990, when I am 38 years old, that I can honestly be Dave 
Pallone and feel happy about myself," he said. "I just wish in my heart I had 
'come out' when I was in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"But as for now, I've never been happier."
