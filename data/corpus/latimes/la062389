On June 16 The Times reported that detainees in the Chinese Changchun trials 
were "led into police stations in the painful posture called 'the airplane 
position' -- arms wrenched behind and in the air." 
</P>
<P>
On June 11, The Times reported that in Los Angeles each of a group of 
protesters refusing to comply with police orders to walk to a Los Angeles 
Police Department bus was approached by two officers who applied to that 
person's arms "a martial arts device composed of two pieces of wood connected 
with a chain or rope." As reported, torque applied to the device "often caused 
pain to show on the face of the person being arrested and sometimes a cry or a 
loud sob" (was heard).

Aren't we in danger of being accused of living in a glass house when we 
criticize other countries for some of their behavior?

HOMELESS HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, the most critical need of the homeless is not food 
or shelter, but rehabilitation programs to get them back into the mainstream 
culture. That's why I commend the Weingart Center and director Maxene Johnston 
for starting the innovative Homeless Evaluation and Linkage Program (HELP), 
which assigns social workers as personal counselors for Skid Row's homeless 
("Counseling Program for Homeless Starts," Metro, June 3). 
</P>
<P>
Especially encouraging is that HELP addresses some of the underlying causes of 
homelessness, such as alcoholism and drug abuse, mental illness and inadequate 
job skills. To ignore these is to condemn the homeless to staying on Skid Row 
no matter how much other help they receive. 
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 homeless men, women and children on Skid 
Row, let's hope HELP wins permanent funding from both the city and the county.

BENAZIR BHUTTO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's pledge to continue military and 
financial aid (in conjunction with the CIA) to the fanatical Islamic rebels 
fighting to overthrow the regime of Afghan President Najibullah is in complete 
contradiction to her expressions of the need for democracy and a broad-based 
settlement, politically, in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the United States and its ally, Pakistan, have not learned the 
historical and political lesson of not interfering in the internal affairs of 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that her country is facing one of its worst economic crises 
ever, Bhutto would do well not to purchase the 60 new F-16 fighters at the cost 
of $1.4 billion from the U.S., and concentrate on raising the standard of 
living of her people.

Your front-page story from Miami Beach talking to the survivors of the "Voyage 
of the Damned" 50 years ago (June 5) was extremely powerful and moving in 
relating a very important episode in the Nazi Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
To those of us who also survived this most tragic era in the history of 
mankind, it brought back painful memories of life in Nazi-occupied Europe, in 
constant fear of being caught and deported to the infamous death camps. 
</P>
<P>
Your staff writer, Barry Bearak, deserves great credit not only for having 
given such a detailed and faithful account of the sufferings of the Jewish 
people under Nazi domination, but also of their futile efforts to find refuge 
in the countries of the free world. 
</P>
<P>
Historian and Holocaust scholar David Wyman was right in stating that "if the 
world had opened its doors, hundreds of thousands of Jews would have been 
saved." 
</P>
<P>
Our sincere and deep appreciation to The Times for having devoted the space for 
this vital historic account.

BALANCING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pondering its response to the repression and brutality inflicted by the Chinese 
government on its own people this month, the Bush Administration found itself 
confronting a sad and familiar dilemma. American moral values and political 
principles demanded that official outrage should be not just expressed but 
tangibly acted upon. The question, as always, was how to do that without, in 
the process, doing harm to the Chinese people, with whom this country has no 
quarrel, and without jeopardizing the future of a delicate and important 
country-to-country relationship. In the end the Administration was no better 
able to find a satisfactory answer than any of its predecessors were in similar 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
What it has done is take the minimum responsive steps that circumstances 
required. It postponed further high-level bilateral government and military 
meetings. It suspended sales of certain military and other equipment. It said 
it would try to get international financial institutions to defer acting on 
pending loan applications from China. And that was pretty much that. Postpone, 
suspend, defer: There is nothing irrevocable about any of these actions, and, 
as a practical matter, nothing very effective, either. No bridges were burned 
by the careful U.S. response, but neither did it stay the heavy hand of 
repression in China. 
</P>
<P>
To say this isn't to suggest that the Administration necessarily could have 
done better. Some in Congress have been quick to denounce a perceived timidity 
and even cravenness on the Administration's part, but their criticisms have 
stopped well short of proposing feasible alternative actions. What, in fact, 
could have been done? To have brought to bear the full arsenal of commercial, 
trade and diplomatic sanctions would surely have hurt China's economy, but the 
heaviest pain would have been felt by its people. At the same time, efforts to 
impose major sanctions would only have been seized upon by those Chinese 
leaders who oppose closer ties with the outside world as a vindication of their 
autarkic and isolationist views. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of China does the United States want to see? Clearly it's in 
long-term American interests to have a China that is politically stable, 
steadily prospering, more closely integrated in the world community and 
governed by moderate and humane leaders. It is this sense of what the future 
could bring that above all has guided the measured U.S. response to recent 
events. The additional hope, of course, is that there will be room in such a 
China for far more individual freedom and far more respect for human rights. 
It's proper -- indeed, imperative -- for the United States and other democratic 
countries to continue expressing that hope. It's no less imperative that the 
democracies go on condemning in the clearest and strongest words all efforts by 
the present Chinese regime to crush that hope.

GRIM REPORT ON WHALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two alarming developments emerged from the International Whaling Commission 
meeting in San Diego: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The stock of whales is lower that the grim earlier assessments had 
predicted, and 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japan is continuing its defiance of the recommendations of the commission's 
scientific committee with plans for an even larger kill of minke whales in the 
Antarctic under the scientific- research exemption to the whaling moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the meeting was marked by new estimates of the appalling kill of 
other sea mammals that suggest an urgent need for the commission to extend its 
work to dolphins and porpoises. Japan killed 39,000 Dall's porpoises in 1988, 
apparently as a substitute for whale meat. An estimated 500,000 dolphins and 
porpoises were killed last year, including those taken by Japanese fishermen, 
thousands more accidentally killed in the nets of American tuna boats and in 
the surface gill nets of Korea, Japan and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has continued its firm support of the moratorium, and 
continues to have sanctions in place against Japan. The moratorium is intended 
to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of world whale stocks, which some of 
the traditional whaling nations hope will justify a resumption of whaling under 
an international quota system. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-year study of whale populations presented at the commission meeting 
raised grave questions. The blue whale, earth's largest creature, has declined 
to an estimated 453 compared with an estimated 250,000 before the beginning of 
commercial whaling in the 15th Century. Fin whales have dropped below 4,000, 
compared with a supposed 500,000 before commercial whaling. Only 4,047 humpback 
and 3,059 sperm whales were counted, although the counts may have been 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The only whale actively hunted now is the minke, whose numbers are in dispute. 
In the last season, Japan took 241, Norway and Iceland fewer than 100 each, all 
under the "scientific research" exemption. Iceland announced it will suspend 
all whaling next year, while Norway announced plans to take 20 and Japan 
proposed 875. Paradoxically, the scientific committee had found the Icelandic 
research useful and valid, while finding the Norwegian and Japanese programs 
without merit. 
</P>
<P>
At least there was firm commission opposition to Japan's request to resume 
coastal whaling next year. But the Japanese argument at the commission meeting 
that it was the victim of cultural prejudice showed how much hard work lies 
ahead to implement effective whale protection.

The Los Angeles Police Department really showed its stuff in putting down the 
anti-abortion protesters on June 10. Yes, the police really showed that they 
can hand it out to those men, women and children by breaking an arm here and 
stepping on a head there. I'm not sure that it demonstrated the "right stuff," 
but it proved that LAPD can make the streets of Los Angeles safe from those who 
pose such a threat to society by peacefully protesting abortion. Too bad LAPD 
can't make our streets safe from drug dealers and gangs.

It was an interesting newspaper on June 11. The lead story on the front page 
was about hundreds of pro-democracy activists being arrested in the People's 
Republic of China ("400 Arrested as China Gears Up to Choke Off Dissent"). The 
lead story in Metro dealt with hundreds of anti-democracy religious fanatics 
being arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that despite the strenuous efforts of religious fundamentalists and 
their conservative Republican supporters, the United States is still 
functioning in the manner in which our Founding Fathers intended.

FROM THE WORKPLACE TO THE POOR HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH A. KINNEY and HOWARD FRUMKIN, Joseph A. Kinney is executive director 
of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago. Howard Frumkin, a director 
of the institute, is on the faculty of the Medical School of the University of 
Pennsylvania.

<P>
Dangerous work is a major contributing factor to poverty in America. Most 
people assume that workers' compensation, insurance and lawsuits take care of 
families when injuries, fatalities or disease strike. The reality is much 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Families often experience a sharp reduction in income when injury from 
dangerous work strikes, prematurely ending careers. For example, workers' 
compensation supplies at best two-thirds of a worker's historic (average of the 
last two years) earnings, and usually provides far less. Meanwhile, benefits 
such as health insurance may be lost, imposing drastic new expenses on the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
America needs to understand the scope of this problem and how it came about. 
Before 1911, a work-related injury or disease was considered the fault of the 
worker. In the following decade, most state governments passed workers' 
compensation programs, a no-fault insurance scheme that covered medical 
expenses and lost wages when workers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
These programs had a significant unintended consequence: They tended to 
legitimate worker injury by "taking care of it" with modest compensation 
payments. In other words, some injury was accepted because compensation, 
however meager, was available. Employers' insurance costs could be comfortably 
predicted and made a part of each year's budget. Business as usual prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Workers' compensation programs were adopted in an era when workplace accidents 
were widely recognized, but occupational diseases were nearly invisible. Since 
then, through tragedy after tragedy, we have been reminded that black lung, 
asbestosis, silicosis, lead poisoning, cancer and other diseases may begin with 
workplace exposures. But there are many barriers to workers' compensation for 
diseases, and it is estimated that less than 10% of serious disease cases are 
currently compensated. Many deserving workers simply go without. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those who receive workers' compensation, the payments are likely to be 
inadequate. In fact, families experiencing the temporary or permanent loss of a 
breadwinner in the 1980s are probably worse off than those who experienced a 
comparable loss in the 1970s. Workers' compensation payments are tied to the 
victim's wages, and real wages of middle- income Americans have declined during 
the last decade. Sixty percent of a machinist's wage today buys less than 60% 
of a machinist's wage 15 years ago. Further, unrealistic caps on compensation 
-- typically ranging between $200-$250 a week -- often impose limits that 
assure absolute poverty for many families. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the availability of lawsuits as a remedy has greatly diminished in 
recent years. Responding to the alleged liability crisis, state legislatures 
have imposed low wrongful death caps and greater restrictions such as 
comparative negligence requirements. In many states, lawsuits arising from 
dangerous workplace incidents have dropped from a trickle to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of this problem is not small. Studies at the Mount Sinai School 
of Medicine in New York show that as many as 70,000 men and women die of 
occupational disease each year. According to the National Safety Council, 
11,000 men and women die from traumatic workplace accidents each year. Another 
70,000 workers are permanently disabled. We believe that 50,000 more 
individuals will be disabled and off the payrolls for at least six months this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Based on demographic patterns, we can estimate that at least half of the total 
-- or at least 100,000 -- disabled men and women will have dependents, and that 
the majority of them will suffer a substantial decline in income after losing a 
breadwinner. 
</P>
<P>
This problem has not come cheap to the public. Congress has partly addressed 
the problem by tapping Social Security -- robbing Peter to pay Paul. Working 
with government analysts, we estimate that workplace accidents and diseases 
cost the Social Security Trust Fund $7.65 billion in fiscal 1988. This Band-Aid 
strategy, while helpful to some workers, simply transfers the costs of 
dangerous workplaces from employers to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
It is terribly wrong for a family that suffers one tragedy to suffer another. 
Two solutions are needed. First, we need better ways to compensate workers who 
become injured or ill while on the job. Workers' compensation must be expanded 
to cover illnesses, must provide adequate wage replacement and must be 
streamlined to achieve prompt payments. Other strategies, such as insurance 
mechanisms, litigation and service programs, must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
A second key element is the prevention of workplace injuries and accidents. As 
we come to understand the nature and costs of the problem, we must apply this 
understanding to research, risk assessment and enforcement of strong health and 
safety standards. By addressing the problem on the front end, we can reduce the 
contribution of dangerous workplaces to suffering and poverty in America.

Odious as the flag-burning protest was, it is useful to recall what else was 
happening in Dallas that summer of 1984. Ronald Reagan arrived for the 
Republican convention and stepped into a rally where his advance men had draped 
perhaps the biggest American flag ever, hanging down 12 stories inside the 
jammed lobby of the Anatole Hotel. Reagan said that the GOP was "America's 
party," and in Dallas and in that fall's campaign commercials, the flag was 
made the symbol of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the GOP game of capture-the-flag did not begin or end in Dallas in 
1984. During the Vietnam War, when there was another epidemic of flag abuse, 
some of those who supported the war effort started wearing lapel flags. By 
1972, those flag pins came to imply support of Richard Nixon versus George 
McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
If the flag stands above politics, for one nation indivisible with liberty and 
justice for all, it commands the respect of all. But if it becomes a partisan 
banner, someone who disagrees with that partisan purpose is going to treat it 
as such.

The Supreme Court now says that as long as there is a message in the act, 
flag-burning is not vandalism but a protected form of "symbolic" speech. At the 
simplest level, the logic is elementary. It is obvious that "symbolic speech" 
will involve the use, and even the occasional abuse, of symbols. 
</P>
<P>
And it is offensive free speech that usually needs judicial protection: The 
power to communicate sometimes involves the power to shock. 
</P>
<P>
None of these ideas are especially new, though they are more familiar in the 
field of artistic modernism than in constitutional law. Verbal and plastic art 
in our century has often explored outer limits of sensation. The language of 
some poetry, the grotesqueness (as it seems to conventional eyes) of some 
abstract art -- these are examples of what courts have often protected, even 
though the most provocative forms of expression have offended millions. 
</P>
<P>
It was inevitable that symbolism as a technique of "speech" would seep into 
First Amendment law; that "symbolic speech," though very possibly undreamed of 
by the framers of the First Amendment, would raid the armory of art to enhance 
and expand its powers to provoke. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is in drawing the lines. Some carry symbolic free speech to all 
imaginable lengths. Others, provoked by the court's previous tolerance of 
pornography or topless dancing, would reject the very idea that free speech 
should permit anything other than the most literal and straightforward 
"political" expression. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, they have a point. Before perceptions were turned upside down by 
modernists like Yeats and Joyce and Eliot, Picasso and Braque, it was as hard 
to imagine such issues as it was to imagine, before the invention of flying 
machines, how the Commerce Clause might apply to aviation. 
</P>
<P>
The court strongly intimates that it is not licensing casual or gratuitous 
vandalism against the flag -- that without a distinct "expressive" purpose, 
flag-burning will continue to be a crime. But even with all the hedging, 
successor controversies can be imagined springing from the fertile minds of 
First Amendment lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Is it "symbolic speech," for instance, to spray-paint a swastika on a 
synagogue, or burn a cross in someone's front yard? Most of us would scoff at 
the mere idea that such outrages might follow logically from the toleration of 
flag-burning. But where are the "bright lines" (as judges like to say) that 
distinguish the one from the other?

"Nerves," James said, breaking into an easy smile that suggested quite an 
opposite temperament. 
</P>
<P>
But such touches of light humor only mask what distinguishes James on the 
field. As those who have followed his career readily volunteer: When it comes 
to his baseball personality, James is Type A Plus. 
</P>
<P>
Intense, driven, motivated and self-critical, James has pushed himself at each 
step. It is little wonder that at 26, he has had a stomach ulcer for six years. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the antacid tablets are never far out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball gave it to me," James said. "This game will drive you up the wall." 
</P>
<P>
At times, his intensity has been his downfall. At times, it has been his source 
of strength. And in times like these, it has been both. 
</P>
<P>
If, in the grand design of the world, there is a time for each of us to be 
tested, James has found his moment. He only wishes he knew when it would end. 
</P>
<P>
From friends to family to baseball, the past month has confronted James with 
one crisis after another. 
</P>
<P>
Fans are likely aware only of the bone bruise on his right leg. It has kept him 
out of the lineup for the past seven games and could force him to miss a 
weekend series with San Francisco that starts tonight. 
</P>
<P>
His odyssey began when Mike Schmidt, his Philadelphia teammate, friend and 
mentor, suddenly retired on May 29. A teary-eyed James quickly was annointed to 
replace Schmidt at third base. The beginning of a new era, Schmidt told him. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the era ended just as abruptly. James was traded to the Padres 
for John Kruk and Randy Ready. The trade was announced by the Padres in 
Cincinnati while the Phillies were playing an extra-inning game against 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
James' wife, Natilee, learned of the trade while watching the game on 
television in a stadium lounge. That was at about the time her husband 
completed his last Philadelphia at-bat to a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
When James was told of the trade, and after it had sunk in that he was leaving 
the only organization he had played for, he cried again. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Schmidt retire was like losing part of his family," said Bill Dancy, 
his manager for his last three years in the Phillies' minor league system. "And 
then to be traded was a blow. Chris is a hard-nosed kid, but he is sentimental, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
James reported to the Padres the next afternoon in Cincinnati mired in the 
worst slump of his career. He had gone hitless in his previous 31 at-bats. He 
would go another seven at-bats before a single in Houston June 5 would break 
the streak and start a five-for-nine run. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever temporary boost that might have provided quickly evaporated when 
James learned that his father had been hospitalized after collapsing at the 
family home in Alto, Tex. He was diagnosed as having a blood clot in his 
kidney. 
</P>
<P>
When the Padres played in Houston early this month, James spent much of his 
time off driving the 140 miles between Alto and Houston. When the Padres left 
Houston for a weekend series in San Francisco, James' father remained in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Padres left San Francisco three losses later, James was falling 
back into his slump. He was started on his way to a zero-for-14 streak. And he 
was starting in left field -- his third position in a week with the Padres -- 
having also played right field and third base. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the latest blow. 
</P>
<P>
Chasing a foul ball down the left-field line in the second inning against 
Cincinnati last Wednesday, James slid into the stands and hit his right leg 
against a metal support. He left the game on a stretcher, his hands and arms 
covering his face as he fought the pain. 
</P>
<P>
James has not played since, and while he remains on the active roster, his 
return date is uncertain. He is taking batting and infield practice, but his 
leg remains sore and Manager Jack McKeon said James will play this weekend only 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The only piece of good news for James has been the improved health of his 
father, who was released from the hospital Monday. 
</P>
<P>
When James does return, he will face the difficult task of simultaneously 
coming in cold and breaking out of a slump. Before the injury, he had only one 
hit in his previous 17 at-bats and had a six-for-64 streak dating back to May 
23. 
</P>
<P>
This from a .263 hitter who had totaled 36 home runs and 120 RBIs in his 
previous two seasons. This year, James is batting .203 with two home runs and 
25 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The most puzzling aspect of the current slump to James is that it has followed 
the best start of his career. He was hitting .356 entering the last week of 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"My first 100 at-bats, you couldn't get me out," James said. "I look at those 
games now, and I realize I was confident. I wasn't thinking about anything but 
the baseball. I could have walked to the plate blindfolded, stood in there and 
'Boom.' But we went down to Houston, and I hit the ball hard all over the place 
and didn't get hits. I let it affect me for some time. I started trying too 
hard to get hits. Then I went into a complete free fall, and I haven't come out 
of it yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had been trying to land James since the end of last season. But 
McKeon said the Phillies were not interested in trading him until recently. 
Their thinking changed after their slow start and the realization that James 
might find the job of replacing Schmidt more than he was ready to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's departure affected James deeply. Despite the 13-year difference in 
their ages, the two had become friends, almost a big-brother relationship. 
Teammates even went to calling them Wally and the Beav. 
</P>
<P>
The friendship with another successful professional athlete was similar to what 
James enjoyed growing up with his older brother, Craig, a running back with New 
England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
James said the friendship with Schmidt began in spring training four years ago, 
when James was still in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was going to give me little pointers every day that would make 
me a better ballplayer," James said. "He and I just got along very well. We 
worked a lot on hitting. We knew I wanted to make myself a better baseball 
player. He just took me under his wing." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their friendship, James said Schmidt confided in him two weeks 
before the announcement that he was going to retire. James said he tried to 
convince Schmidt to delay the decision for several weeks, but that Schmidt was 
adamant. Even knowing the decision in advance, James could not hide his 
emotions. Seeing Schmidt break down and sob brought him to tears. James makes 
no apologies for failing to hide his emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very special emotional attachment to each other," James said. "It was 
an emotional period in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Almost four weeks later, James said he still cannot bring himself to watch the 
complete tape his wife made of Schmidt's televised announcement, especially the 
part when Schmidt breaks down in tears at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"I fast-forwarded through all of that," James said. "I didn't want to see 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But his emotional reaction to his friend's retirement helped precipitate the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very, very close to Mike Schmidt, and we figured that might be a 
detriment to someone trying to take over for him," Philadelphia General Manager 
Lee Thomas said. "Chris is somewhat nervous and that bothered him. We figured 
it might better for a new guy to take over the position." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, too, figured the change of scenery could serve James well. Getting 
away from the aggressive Philadelphia fans, the pressure of replacing Schmidt 
and the losing atmosphere around a struggling team might help James snap out of 
his slump. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said he hoped James would bring some power to a lineup that needs some 
punch to complement Jack Clark. The Padres still talk about a home run James 
hit off Eric Nolte in 1987 that landed in the upper deck of San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. It was the last upper-deck homer there and made James one of 
only six players -- Dick Allen, Dave Kingman, Kevin McReynolds, Ivan Murrell 
and Nate Colbert are the others -- to accomplish the feat in 21 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider myself a home-run hitter, but I think I can hit 15 to 25 a 
year," James said. "What I feel I can do is drive in runs. That is what I want 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
The results, however, have not been instantaneous, but then James has had much 
on his mind. Adding to the difficulty of transition is that James found himself 
joining the Padres at the start of their worst extended trip since 1980. James 
went from a team that had lost 10 games in a row to one that was on its way to 
losing nine of 10. But James can see a difference in the teams. 
</P>
<P>
"This team knows it can win," James said. "No one is pushing the panic button. 
In Philadelphia, the problem was we dug such a deep hole we tended to think the 
season was over. We were already down, we were already out. But these guys know 
in their hearts they can still win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
James just wants to do his part, but his hitting troubles have continued with 
his new club. He is batting .182 for the Padres with six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been worrying about too many things," James said. "I've been trying to 
get that perfect mechanical swing every time, but you can't do that. All you 
can do is get in the box and let the bat go." 
</P>
<P>
Trying too hard, instead of relaxing, is a common problem for James. He has 
always been one of those players who thinks a lot about his performance, maybe 
too much, according to some who have managed him. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes James gets so down on himself he needs a big boost to get him set 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing you can do with Chris is to keep throwing positive thoughts at 
him," said Dancy, who now manages the Phillies' Triple-A team in 
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pa. "He needs that reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Roly DeArmas, his manager his first two seasons in the Philadelphia minor 
league system, remembers James coming to him early in his first season at 
Class-A Spartanburg, S.C., distressed over his slow start. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Maybe I've reached my peak. Maybe this is it,' " DeArmas 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
James was hitting under .200 at the time. The year before, in his first season 
with the Phillies after signing a free-agent contract, James hit .317, led the 
rookie Northwest League with 19 doubles, had 12 home runs and drove in 50 runs 
for DeArmas at Bend, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The story seems laughable now. But at the time, it was not. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe Chris was serious, but I realize he probably was," said 
DeArmas, who now manages the Phillies' rookie team in Martinsville, Va. "Chris 
is a gamer. He will give you all he has. But he is the kind of player who can 
get down on himself real easily. You always need to give him that pat on the 
back to get him going." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said he recognized that early with James. But he figures that can be 
overcome. He has tried to work James in easily. 
</P>
<P>
Although he envisions James as the Padres' third baseman of the future, McKeon 
has played him mainly in the outfield, allowing Luis Salazar and Tim Flannery 
(before he was placed on the disabled list last week) to handle third. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they want someone to play third base in the future," James said. "But 
with Luis doing such a good job there, they can't pull a guy off of third base 
who is playing as well as he is." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon also was experimenting with batting James leadoff, a spot he handled for 
the Phillies on occasion. Hitting there might encourage him to be more 
selective and take away some of the pressure that has led to the slump. 
</P>
<P>
James said all he needs to do is relax and let the ups and downs wash over him. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have to do is learn to accept the bad streaks and not let it affect me 
like this one has," James said. "When I do that, I know I will be a much better 
player. I hurt myself when I get down on myself and try to change everything. 
</P>
<P>
"If I just stay within myself, I will be fine. If I get my 500 at-bats a 
season, I know I will put some good numbers on the board."

ARREOLA'S STATUS WITH WORLD GAMES TEAM UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Ortega 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darcy Arreola's seventh-place finish in the women's 1,500 meters at The 
Athletics Congress championships in Houston last Saturday appeared to have 
qualified the Cal State Northridge junior for the U. S. team that will compete 
in the World University Games in Duisburg, West Germany, in August. 
</P>
<P>
But Arreola and Northridge Coach Don Strametz remain unsure whether TAC 
officials will award her the berth on the team. The qualifying criterion for 
the World University Games team seemed simple enough -- the top two U. S. 
collegiate finishers in each event are selected. But debate centers on just who 
was the second U. S. collegian in Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
Suzy Favor of Wisconsin was the top collegian, placing second in 4 minutes, 
12.29 seconds behind Regina Jacobs (4:11.80) of Team New Balance. 
</P>
<P>
But Alisa Harvey of Athletics West (sixth in 4:14.59) reacted after the race as 
if she was the second U. S. collegian, and not Arreola, who placed seventh in 
4:18.35. 
</P>
<P>
"Darcy and I both thought that she (Darcy) was the second qualifier," Strametz 
said. "But Harvey seemed to think that she was still eligible for the team." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Harvey, the 1986 NCAA 1,500 champion, beat Arreola, but 
the question is whether she is considered a collegiate runner. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense says no, but TAC rules may say yes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Harvey completed her senior season at Tennessee in 1987, she is 
reportedly still enrolled in classes at the Knoxville campus and, therefore, 
could be considered a collegian. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, there are some loopholes in the rules," Strametz said. "And the 
TAC isn't sure whether or not she is a collegian." 
</P>
<P>
Laverne Sweat, the women's track coach at Norfolk State and manager of the 
World University Games women's team, is expected to make a ruling in the next 
week or so, according to Strametz. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be disappointing if she (Arreola) isn't selected to the team. But if 
she's not, there's not much we can do about it," Strametz said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Arreola: Although she may not know where she will be running in late 
August, Arreola is sure of her itinerary before then. 
</P>
<P>
She will run the 3,000 at the U. S. Olympic Festival in Norman, Okla., (July 
28-30) and will compete in the mile in the Jack in the Box Invitational at UCLA 
on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Add Northridge: After the NCAA Division II championships in Hampton, Va., last 
month, Strametz said that juniors Arreola, Walt Stewart (men's high jump 
champion) and Lolita Pile (runner-up in the women's triple jump) might redshirt 
next season so that Northridge could make a respectable debut at the Division I 
level in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, a decision regarding their 1990 seasons won't be made until January. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of them will train as if they're going to compete for the school 
next year," Strametz said. "And when January rolls around, we'll see how things 
are going and make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Southern comfort: Tennessee freshman Tom Parker cannot say enough good things 
about the Knoxville campus and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
The former Notre Dame High standout loves backpacking in the Great Smoky 
Mountains and water-skiing on the local lakes. He likes the easy-going Southern 
pace and the friendly manner of the locals. 
</P>
<P>
But Parker has a great distaste for the competitive atmosphere in the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they view track down here is completely different from the way they 
view it in California," said Parker, who pole vaulted 17 feet in high school. 
"The pole vault is a social event in California. You're out there in your beach 
chair, hanging out with the guys and competing. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, other athletes won't even talk to you at the meets. They won't even 
talk to you once you get to town. They're just so intense and focused on what 
they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who hung a sign on his wall saying "18 feet or die" before the season 
started, never adjusted to that intensity during an unproductive season. 
</P>
<P>
Although he cleared 17-6 in practice, his best in competition was 16-6, which 
he vaulted in three meets. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, I was in great shape, but I was never able to put it all together 
in a meet. I just wasn't comfortable with that cutthroat attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation got so bad in April and May that a homesick Parker considered 
moving back to California and training with his high school coach, Tim Werner, 
now an assistant at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of months ago, I was real close to going back home," Parker said. 
"But I just decided to stick it out here. I didn't want to make a hasty 
decision after one year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can vault 19 feet in the next two or three years. I know I have that 
in me."

L. A. GAMES NOTEBOOK;

<P>
GRANADA HILLS WELL-GUARDED FOR STERN TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Johnson describes them as very young and very erratic, but he'll have to 
call them very good, too, if his Granada Hills High basketball team continues 
to win in the L. A. Games tournament, which concludes Sunday with the 
semifinals and final at El Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to attend last week's games because he was out of town, Johnson was 
pleasantly surprised when he returned to school Monday and learned that the 
Highlanders had won their first three contests. 
</P>
<P>
"We can be very good at times and we can be horrible at others," Johnson said. 
"And, apparently, last weekend was just one of those good periods." 
</P>
<P>
After squeaking by Tustin, 46-45, in a first-round game Saturday at Fremont 
High, Granada Hills -- led by Jermoine Brantley -- defeated St. Joseph, 71-49, 
and Inglewood, 54-51, in the second and third rounds Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley averaged 10.3 points and 3.5 assists as the off-guard last season. 
</P>
<P>
He also answered to the nickname Jamal then, but he wants to go by his real 
name now that he's the starting point guard and approaching his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's Jermoine or Jamal, Brantley is the only returning starter from 
last season's squad, one that finished 13-9 and tied for third in the North 
Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
He and Aaron Lattimore, a reserve forward last season, are the only players on 
the Highlander roster with varsity experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very young, but we have some talented players," Johnson said. "Jermoine 
has extremely quick hands and feet." 
</P>
<P>
Brantley and Co. will be put to a severe test Saturday when they play Fremont, 
the defending City Section 3-A Division champion, in a fourth-round game at 
North Torrance High at noon. 
</P>
<P>
If Granada Hills beats the Pathfinders, it will play the winner of the Manual 
Arts-Muir game in a quarterfinal at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Add basketball: Cleveland, which lost to Westchester, 77-75, in the tournament 
championship last year, defeated Santa Ana Valley, 49-23, San Fernando, 60-43, 
and Long Beach Poly, 64-60, in games at El Camino last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers will play Ocean View in a fourth-round game at North Torrance 
High at 10 a.m. on Saturday and, if they win, will meet the winner of the 
Fairfax-Santa Barbara game in a quarterfinal at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax upset Cleveland, 53-51, in the quarterfinals of the City 4-A playoffs 
this year. And if that isn't enough motivation, the fact that the tournament 
will be Bob Braswell's last as the Cavalier coach should give the Cleveland 
players added motivation. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell will become an assistant coach at Long Beach State on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Last add basketball: Seedings have not meant much in this tournament as only 
four (No. 1-seeded Manual Arts, No. 4 Cleveland, No. 7 Westchester and No. 8 
Fremont) of the top 10 teams are left. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that can be attributed to the fact that seedings are often based on 
what the team did last season, not on how many players are returning from that 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed Cowboy: Canyon was upset by Grant, 14-13, in a first-round 
football game at North Torrance High on Saturday, leaving Coach Harry Welch in 
a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
"What's real important is the way we play rather than how we play at this time 
of the year," Welch said. "The final score isn't as important as the intensity 
and effort we put forth. Unfortunately, we didn't display much of either the 
other day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with Grant. They competed. Their effort was really nice. I 
wasn't impressed with Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Tim Beidle was impressive, however, although 11 of his 
passes were dropped, according to Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw the ball well," Welch said. "But if our receivers keep dropping the 
ball like that next season, we're not going to pass much. We'll just keep 
giving the ball to (Chris) Peery." 
</P>
<P>
Peery rushed for 1,290 yards as a sophomore and 1,418 yards as a junior.

COACH DEVOTES HIMSELF TO HIS BOYS, BASKETBALL; 
</P>
<P>
'HE'S LIKE THE FATHER I NEVER HAD,' SAYS ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Although he makes his living as an accountant, Joe Perry's life is basketball 
and the street children who play it. To them, this Christian man in shorts and 
T-shirt is both coach and guiding light, instilling character and respect along 
with the man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like the father I never had," said Stais Boseman of Inglewood, a 6-foot-2 
eighth-grader on Perry's champion 14-and-under Long Beach Lakers. "He does a 
lot for us. You don't have money, he buys you stuff to eat. He teaches 
basketball and sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were in their purple shorts in the First Baptist Church gym in 
downtown Long Beach. Beneath dim lights, breakaway rims snapped down and back 
in place as the taller youngsters, already under the influence of Michael 
Jordan, attempted dunk shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I put in more time at this than I do at my actual job," said Perry, 31, who 
works for a Santa Fe Springs manufacturing firm. He was quietly overseeing the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He overflows with basketball," said Perry's wife, Charlotte, watching from a 
small set of bleachers. "Each year I ask him, 'How many teams are you going to 
coach?' so I can get myself mentally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who was a guard at Harbor City Christian High School but continued his 
playing career only in recreation leagues because he thought his 5-9 height was 
against him, also coaches two youth teams in Cerritos. He was assistant varsity 
coach at Leffingwell Christian High in Norwalk from 1980 to 1986. He first 
coached when he was 13 and does not foresee stopping. Due to the satisfaction 
he gets from working with younger players, he says he has no desire to return 
to coaching at a high school. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago he formed the Lakers, finding the eighth- and ninth-graders by 
corresponding with junior high schools and visiting parks and playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, 42-7 since last October, won the championship of the spring junior 
varsity division of the American Roundball Corp.'s Future Stars League at 
Artesia High School, and are in the ARC Summer League at North Hollywood High. 
They are among the elite of privately supported traveling teams, which consist 
of better grade-school and junior-high players. They play almost year-round, 
usually in tournaments, sometimes in other states. There are several traveling 
team leagues, ARC and Slam-n-Jam being the biggest. The leagues are not 
associated with schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very unselfish players," Perry said of his Lakers. "They brag about 
points after a game, but during a game they think about winning. I tell them 
it's not good if you score 30 points and we lose. They never give up, each 
player has the desire to win." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders on the team include Boseman, averaging 22 points a game; Rudy 
Washington Jr., who averages 24 points a game and is the son of University of 
Iowa assistant coach Rudy Washington; and Marmet Williams, a 3-point specialist 
who will attend Mater Dei High School in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Lakers are from South-Central Los Angeles and Inglewood, 
although Long Beach, Lynwood, Cerritos and Fountain Valley are also 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
Perry is dedicated to helping inner-city youngsters. He normally picks up one 
group in Los Angeles and drives them to Long Beach for practice at the church 
gym that he rents for a minimal fee, while Charlotte, a sales secretary, picks 
up another group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Brother Image 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of them has the possibility of turning to gangs and drugs," said 
Perry, who sees himself as their big brother. "I think this will keep them out 
of trouble, off the streets. They have their own little spats, but I have not 
had any problems as far as their discipline with me. They fully respect me and 
all the adults involved. They are extremely disciplined. People are impressed; 
they expect them to be wild." 
</P>
<P>
Because of gangs and drugs, Perry said, fearful inner-city children are staying 
away from parks. "Outside their area they feel more comfortable," he said. 
"Stais was extremely quiet with me at first, but now has become very open and 
relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
On the court, a Laker missed a layup. "Got to make the basket, baby," Perry 
said, without raising his voice. 
</P>
<P>
It is Perry's intention to get the youngsters out of their environment and give 
them exposure that they've never had. "People I grew up with," he said, "are 
still on the same street, at the same house, living with their parents. These 
kids have the potential to end up like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have become seasoned travelers. They have gone in rented vans to San 
Francisco, Santa Barbara and Las Vegas, staying in hotels and motels, usually 
at Perry's expense. "The kids call it the pro life," he said. Even short trips 
to Trabuco Hills and Huntington Beach have been big events for the players, who 
had never seen gyms unmarred by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Boseman said he and another player missed curfew one night and Perry "made us 
run 15 laps around the (motel) parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grades Emphasized 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who, like his wife, grew up in a church environment, preaches about the 
importance of education. He suspended two Lakers until they improved their 
grades. He said more than 65% of the players have at least a B average. 
</P>
<P>
"It's super to be a good athlete," he said, "but these kids have to realize 
that, even if they go into the NBA and make a million dollars, you have to have 
some kind of education to know how to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
Perry's efforts have not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids are all of good character, and I'm sure that's a reflection of his 
teaching," said Rich Goldberg, director of ARC. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said that at first it was not easy to get parents interested. "They 
thought of me as a baby-sitter," he said. "They thought that if the kids were 
at practice or a game, they were out of their hair, and that was fine. It took 
them a while to see what was going on. When they saw that this was a positive 
thing, they started to come and watch the kids play, and get a little 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
The Perrys have two basketball-playing children who help with the Lakers. 
Daughter Shannon, a seventh-grader, calls the boys to let them know practice 
times, and fourth-grader Joey is the ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parent Group Formed 
</P>
<P>
The family has been such an inspiration that Betty Morris of Cerritos, whose 
son, Kevin, is a Laker, came up with the idea to start a Parents Who Care Youth 
Foundation so that tutoring programs can be provided for the youngsters. The 
foundation was set up by Lowell Henry, the team's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Henry also acquired a sponsor in K-Swiss, which provides shoes for the team. 
Previously, Perry paid for shoes and uniforms himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him doing something without asking for help," Henry said. "He loves 
basketball, he loves these kids, he loves winning. But he was straining 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
When practice was over on that recent night, the players gathered around Perry. 
They listened intently, and it was apparent that his guiding light was shining 
some more.

STATE UNHAPPY ABOUT FUNDING SDSU'S TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year ago, an aged and somewhat weathered Choc Sportsman Track at San Diego 
State University received a face lift, compliments of the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements, featuring a state-of-the-art Mondo surface -- the same kind 
that will be used at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona -- and new surfaces 
for all jumping and throwing areas, cost $225,000 and was paid for by the state 
university system. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, after the suspension of the men's and women's track programs at 
SDSU, the state-of-the-art track no longer has a primary user, and the state is 
not amused. 
</P>
<P>
The action hardly excited the people at the CSU's Office of the Chancellor in 
Long Beach, who determine allocations from appropriations from the state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we hadn't given them the money a year ago," said Plant Operations 
Services Chief Ted Binkley, who worked closely with SDSU on their proposal made 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way. I'm not going to say we're bitter. The allocation at the 
time was a proper one. It's unfortunate they had to do away with the track 
program. If we'd known it would have been cancelled, we would not have 
allocated the money." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, San Jose State was to have received a similar allocation for 
track improvements, but when the university dropped the track program, the 
proposal was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley explained that the $225,000 used for improvements to SDSU's track were 
taken from a $644,000 budget that had originally included other improvement 
projects at SDSU, such as repairing an eroded roadside bank, renovating seven 
steam vaults, replacing steam lines and reparing mechanical controls. 
</P>
<P>
Those projects, he said, "were either not done, or not done in total." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU President Thomas Day rejected the criticisms. "They don't have anything to 
do with it," he said. "They're speaking out of line. They don't have one thing 
to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel apologetic for getting a state-of-the-art track. That track will 
not grow weeds. We have thousands of students who will use the track. I felt it 
was very unfortunate (to lose the track program), but it was a necessary 
procedure. Hindsight is always 20-20, even from a distance as far away as Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of confidence in my senior officials. (Athletic Director 
Fred) Miller brought the recommendation to me. I completely agreed with his 
decision. There is certainly nothing wrong with the (track) program. It's just 
something that needed to be done. You look at a way to save the most amount of 
money, by administering the least amount of hurt." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's men's and women's track teams both fell victim to budgetary cuts caused 
by a $190,000 shortfall in the projected earnings of the football program. 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, Miller carefully used the term "suspended 
indefinitely," which means it is suspended until Coach Jim Cerveny can raise 
enough money -- in this case $100,000 -- to put the program back together 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Cerveny and his staff continue to try to raise the necessary funds. Cerveny 
said Walter Tuner, an SDSU alumnus and track coach at San Diego City College, 
had donated $1,000, and Len Miller, a former coach of American miler Steve 
Scott, donated $500 and is getting involved with additional plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been nothing but positive," Cerveny said. "A lady (Joan Tunick) walked in 
today and volunteered to do all the typing and mailing we need done. It's those 
types of individuals that we need."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: TRACK STAR GLEN REYES SIGNS CONTRACT WITH ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glen Reyes, a four-time San Diego Section track champion from Orange Glen High, 
signed a professional baseball contract Tuesday night with the Houston Astros 
for an undisclosed amount. Reyes, drafted in the 13th round, will report to the 
Astros' Rookie League club in Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Three other local players who were drafted in this month's amateur draft will 
attend college. Crawford High third baseman Manny Gagliano, drafted in the 17th 
round by Milwaukee, has signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Oklahoma 
State after turning down a $20,000 offer from the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years of college should help a lot," Gagliano said. "My goal now is to 
become a No. 1 draft choice when I get out of college." 
</P>

Mt. Carmel shortstop John Tejcek, selected in the 23rd round by Oakland, will 
play at the University of Arizona, which has won two NCAA baseball 
championships in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Miah Bradbury, who played at Mt. Carmel three years ago, turned down about 
$40,000 from the Philadelphia Phillies and will play his senior season at 
Loyola Marymount. Bradbury, a catcher, was taken by the Phillies in the sixth 
round.

PACIFICARE MAKES OFFER FOR S.D. HMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PacifiCare Health Systems, a health-maintenance organization based in Cypress 
with more than 500,000 subscribers, announced Thursday it has made a friendly 
offer to acquire certain assets of troubled Western Health Plans of San Diego, 
which runs the 130,000-subscriber HMO called Greater San Diego Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
If consummated, the acquisition would make PacifiCare the state's third largest 
HMO after Kaiser Permanente with 4 million members and HealthNet which has 
about 700,000 members, PacifiCare chief financial officer Wayne Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare, which made the bid at Western's invitation, would not disclose the 
amount it offered to pay for the assets including Western's membership, 
provider contracts and contracts with employers. PacifiCare's subscriber base 
includes 360,000 members in Southern California with the balance in Oregon, 
Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
The two parties will begin negotiating a deal today and thus have not executed 
a definitive purchase agreement. But no other offers for Western are currently 
on the table, Western's acting president Samuel Westover said Thursday. A sale 
of the assets bid for by PacifiCare would mean Western's end as a going 
concern, Westover said. 
</P>
<P>
"Western came to us and said 'We'd be interested in selling the company and 
here is the range of terms we were thinking would be appropriate'. We worked 
with that and responded based on (the specified terms)," Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell added that a definitive offer would depend on Western's agreement to a 
"restructuring of the delivery system," meaning a significant reduction in the 
number of doctors currently providing services to Greater San Diego Health Plan 
subscribers. That kind of restructuring could meet with resistance from some 
shareholders since the bulk of Western's stock is held by the 1,500 San Diego 
physicians who also provide services to the subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Western Health Plans closed up 18 cents at 69 cents per share in American Stock 
Exchange trading while PacifiCare stock was unchanged in over-the-counter 
trading at $26.75. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Problems 
</P>
<P>
Similar to many other HMOs in the country, Western has suffered serious 
financial problems in recent years, resulting in several management 
reshufflings and scaling back of operations. With shareholder equity of 
negative $15.8 million as of March 31, Western has been looking for an investor 
or buyer for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Two other acquisition deals involving Western fell through in recent months, 
including a $21 million offer from a consortium of hospitals led by Sharp 
HealthCare and Scripps Memorial of San Diego, as well as a $15 million offer 
from Mercy Hospital of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Western, whose subscribers are exclusively San Diego County residents, lost 
$20.2 million over a three-year period ending last June 30. For the nine months 
ended March 31, Western lost $7.1 million on revenue of $102.4 million. Over 
the past year, Western has closed its HMO operations in Riverside County and 
Nevada and has also closed a company-operated clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Healthy Reputation 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare, by contrast, is one of the best-managed HMOs in the country, said 
Rae Alperstein, a health industry analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They have done well at managing their costs and putting in place contracts 
with doctors that leave the company at less risk than some other HMOs," 
Alperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare is one of the few HMOs never to have reported a quarterly loss since 
going public in 1985 and PacifiCare and FHP of Fountain Valley are industry 
leaders in profitability in terms of percentage of revenue, Lowell said. For 
the first six months of its fiscal year ended March 31, PacifiCare reported a 
profit of $3.2 million on revenue of $284 million. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare's acquisition of Western would be a way of increasing its presence 
in San Diego, a market it thinks highly of, Lowell said. The company already 
has 50,000 members in San Diego County, most of whom are elderly Medicare 
subscribers who receive medical services through Secure Horizons, a program 
administered at Rees Stealy Medical Group clinics.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: FATHER'S STORY MAY HOLD GRAIN OF TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My father told the story about four Prevatte brothers who left 
England and came to America, landing at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that two brothers went to Lumberton, N.C., one to Waycross, Ga., and 
one to St. Augustine, Fla. He also said his grandfather did not like the e on 
Prevatte and paid the court $10 to drop it. 
</P>
<P>
From what I've picked up over the years I believe the Prevatte family was 
French Huguenot. Can you point me in the right direction to research my family? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The name as you spell it does not appear in early New England records 
that I consulted, throwing some doubt on the family story of landing at 
Plymouth Rock. Possibly the name originally was Privett, Privette or Privott, 
in which case it is English, meaning one who came from Privett (copse of 
privet, an ornamental shrub) in Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
However, many family traditions claim their name's spelling was officially 
changed, when it fact it was done informally. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing to do is begin your research in censuses, marriage, probate and 
land records in the states and counties where your ancestors lived and trace 
them backward, generation by generation, until you find the immigrant. You'll 
find your name has been spelled many ways in the records, but pay attention to 
how the name was spelled when signatures of your ancestors were required. 
</P>
<P>
Start at your local library by reading any of the several good, basic how-to 
books on genealogy -- "Shaking Your Family Tree" by Dr. Ralph Crandall is one 
of the best. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My ancestor, Heinrich (John Henry) Anderson, emigrated from Baden-Baden, 
Germany, in 1870 when he was 14 to New York. According to the 1910 Hugo 
(Choctaw County), Okla., census, he became a naturalized citizen upon his 
arrival in New York. How can I obtain a copy of his naturalization papers? 
</P>
<P>
A: The 1910 census asked the "year of immigration" and whether one was 
"naturalized or alien," so your ancestor may have arrived in New York in 1870 
but was not likely naturalized that year as residency requirement was five 
years at that time. 
</P>
<P>
If you can determine where your ancestor was living between 1870-1877, that 
would be the logical place where he filed a declaration. Aliens could go before 
any court of record and declare their intent to become a citizen after they had 
resided in the United States for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
The county courthouse in the vicinity of an immigrant's residence is the best 
place to begin. The LDS (Mormon) Family History Library in Salt Lake City has 
filmed many naturalization records -- check its card catalogue in a branch 
library near you to learn if the records you need have been microfilmed. 
</P>
<P>
For more tips on how to locate naturalization records, read the chapter on 
"Tracking Immigrant Origins" in "The Source," edited by Arlene Eakle and Johni 
Cerny.

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: MORTALITY AND HUMOR COLLIDE IN WICK WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leah Ollman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kitsch and commentary both get their due in the recent work of Wick Alexander, 
now on view at the Dietrich Jenny Gallery (660 9th Ave.). 
</P>
<P>
From black velvet parodies to brightly hued tragedies, Alexander's paintings 
charm, tease and lament. Humor collides with mortality on more than one 
occasion and violence -- to the body, spirit and earth -- thrives in beautiful 
locales. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a local artist and graduate of the UC San Diego Master of Fine Arts 
program, paints with a light touch; his clear, accessible forms evoking aspects 
of illustration, cartoons and folk art. 
</P>
<P>
Whether taking a pointed view of the U.S. border with Mexico, a satiric stab at 
condos on the fairway or a voyeuristic peek into a gringo's tropical island 
fantasy, Alexander approaches his subjects with a naive charm. He grazes over 
sensitive social issues, but never lets a prescribed agenda override his regard 
for the canvas as visual playground. 
</P>
<P>
In "La Linea," for instance, Alexander tucks references to illegal border 
crossing and economic inequity into an otherwise quaint survey of the border's 
architectural landmarks. Seen from an elevated viewpoint and spanning a broad 
horizontal canvas, the scene appears at once to be of both epic ambition and 
diminutive scale. 
</P>
<P>
The Centro Cultural's familiar dome, the bullfighting ring and the ubiquitous 
liquor stores, body shops, bars and clubs define Tijuana, while a dusty field 
and half-completed housing development make up the southern edge of this 
country. An Immigration and Naturalization Service helicopter hovers over the 
border, blind to a pair of figures scampering north beyond the border fence, 
toward the cluster of "Robbing Hood Homes." Just as their passage escapes the 
view of the INS, so do they miss the message of a nearby billboard on which the 
familiar Marlboro man stands beside a barbed wire fence. Across the bottom of 
the sign runs the warning: "The Government Has Determined That Border Crossing 
is Dangerous to Health." 
</P>
<P>
By lacing the painting's folksy naivete with a pungent social message, 
Alexander himself straddles the border between two genres in an amusing, 
poignant manner. In "Bamboo Hut" and a series of paintings on round, pressed 
wood panels, his subjects are more obscure, but his style is just as immediate 
and playful. 
</P>
<P>
A row of slim bamboo stalks screens the image in "Bamboo Hut," painted in 
garish colors on black velvet. Looking through the bamboo becomes a mildly 
surreptitious act, especially when the painting's subject becomes clear. In the 
hot orange and screaming green typical of black velvet paintings, Alexander 
lays out the essential ingredients of tropical paradise: sunset, lush foliage 
and coarsely built huts on the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
As in "La Linea," however, Alexander undermines the familiar or cliche with 
hints of a less seductive social reality. On one of the water's banks, a 
typical tourist relaxes beside his fishing box and portable barbecue. Between 
his legs looms a tall palm tree; a nude woman clings to the top of the trunk, 
just beneath a cluster of coconuts. On the opposite bank a skeleton sits, 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Bamboo Hut" reads as a comic, sexually suggestive image, but it can also be 
interpreted as an indictment of Western culture's fantasies about primitivism 
and the enticing conquest of "less civilized" peoples. The presence of the 
skeleton signals the inevitable, ominous end of such pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Alexander's paintings on round panels also tickle the senses but follow 
up with a slap. In "Retablo for Lupe," a man operating a forklift begins to 
deposit a tree bedecked with butterfly wings into its human-designated spot of 
earth when the chain holding the tree to the vehicle snaps. The tree threatens 
to crush the gardener standing below, equipped only with a shovel and a 
comic-book expression of fright.

"My Retablo" depicts a related scene. This time a palm tree is being 
mechanically inserted into a neat square plot when the rig collides with 
overhead electrical wires. Workmen scatter as the wires snap and emit a visible 
"Bzzzzzttt POP." The simple renderings, with their crudely drawn figures and 
cartoon sound effects, convey the situation at a glance and even suggest a 
moral: When humans subvert the natural order, they enter the unpredictable 
world of the absurd, crass and potentially dangerous. Two paintings of golfing 
scenes also indict the artificiality of contemporary urban life, especially our 
twisting of the land to suit practical, profitable motives.

Alexander dips briefly into the celebration of untrammelled nature in the 
pastel "Orchids and Bromeliads." Elsewhere he pays homage to the tragic life of 
artist Frida Kahlo and wallows in the pure kitsch of black velvet painting. 
</P>
<P>
In "La Guerra de los Mariachis," Alexander stages a mad festival of cliches, 
both good-humored and crude, in the public square of a Mexican village. Lovers 
kiss in the street, children play in the public fountain, men stagger with open 
bottles, dogs sniff at each other and mariachis play throughout the chaos. A 
devil stands in one doorway, and a skeleton in another, reminders that 
Alexander is always keen to the omens, spirits and shadows that darken even the 
most whimsical parade. 
</P>
<P>
The show continues through July 1.

FNN FANS WOULD RATHER FIGHT THAN SWITCH TO NEW NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
LOYAL VIEWERS GET OFF THEIR SOFAS TO PROTEST WHEN BUSINESS NEWS SERVICE AXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On paper, it seemed like the switch from Financial News Network to the Consumer 
News and Broadcast Channel was a great move for cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
CNBC, a 24-hour-a-day service which debuted nationwide April 17, was, as its 
name implies, the product of no less a TV powerhouse than NBC. It featured 
seasoned hosts such as Dick Cavett, a huge bankroll -- reportedly $65 million 
-- to see it through a building period and the kind of market research 
projections that programmers dreams about. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike FNN, an 8-year-old service specializing in hard-core stock market and 
commodities coverage, CNBC was created to appeal to the everyday consumer 
seeking guidance in making major purchases as well as dabbling in the sport of 
the 1980s -- investments. 
</P>
<P>
"They had surveys and research, done by an independent researcher, that showed 
that even the viewers who watched FNN regularly would prefer CNBC," said Tom 
Belcher, general manager of West Valley Cablevision, a system serving 75,000 
homes in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, however, never spoke to Geri Pearlman. All the demographic 
studies and the graphs and charts meant nothing to her on that morning that 
West Valley Cablevision switched, unannounced, to CNBC. She let them know, 
loudly and often, that she wanted her FNN. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a homemaker," said Pearlman, who lives with her husband in West 
Hills, "but when I turned on the TV that morning and my FNN was gone, I got 
hysterical. . . . It turned me from a couch potato who used to watch the 
markets with my poodle in my lap, into a wild-eyed activist." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at West Valley Cablevision said their decision to switch from FNN to 
CNBC was made neither to save money nor because the company had any vested 
interests in the new service. "If fact, we had to pay CNBC twice as much, per 
subscriber, than we had to pay FNN," Belcher said. Cablevision officials would 
not disclose figures, but according to FNN President David Meister, his service 
charges cable operators 3 1/2 cents per subscriber while CNBC charges 7 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher said that rumors about West Valley Cablevision owning a piece of CNBC 
arose because of a confusion over names. There is a system also called 
Cablevision on Long Island, N.Y., that has a vested interest in CNBC, but it 
has no connection to Cablevision Industries, the industry giant that has about 
950,000 subscribers nationwide on 85 different systems, including West Valley 
Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very impressed with what we saw of CNBC before they launched," said 
David Testa, a Cablevision Industries vice president, speaking from the home 
office in Liberty, N.Y. "That was the sole reason we wanted it. It's a very 
good service and we think it will have broad appeal for our subscribers." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Belcher said he believed CNBC would garner a lot of attention and help 
attract new subscribers in the West Valley, where the system has signed up just 
over 40% of the potential customers in its area. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the old subscribers they had to worry about. On CNBC's 
launch day, all the Cablevision Industries systems made the switch without 
warning to their customers. "We usually announce any change at least 30 days in 
advance," Belcher said, "but we were afraid if we disclosed our plans FNN might 
quit us right away and our subscribers would be left without a cable financial 
channel until CNBC started up." 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman, the faithful FNN watcher, reacted immediately. "I started calling 
everyone I could think of," she said. One of the people she reached was 
Belcher. "The calls started coming in that very first day," he said, shaking 
his head and smiling. "Lots of calls." 
</P>
<P>
FNN, with headquarters in Los Angeles and New York, had built up a great deal 
of loyalty in its eight years of coverage centering on stock exchanges and 
other money markets. According to Pearlman, one stock trader in the West Valley 
felt the service was so crucial to his livelihood that he bought a satellite 
dish to pull in FNN. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was not confined to money market professionals, however. "I can't 
say I really play the market," Pearlman said, "but my husband has some 
retirement income that we worry about and we have the ability to move it 
around. We based a lot of our decisions on the things I would hear about on 
FNN." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Pearlman, who leaves FNN on during the day even when she is just 
puttering around the house, said she made one of her most crucial financial 
decisions of her life based on what she heard on the channel. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the market crash on October 19, 1987, on a Monday?," she asked. 
"Well, on the Friday before that I was watching the ticker on FNN and listening 
to the things the people on the station and the guests talked about. It wasn't 
anything they said directly, but I just got a feeling. I pulled my money out of 
the stock market, all of it. 
</P>
<P>
"When the market crashed on Monday we were out." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher asked those who wrote or called to be patient, to give CNBC a chance. 
CNBC, feeling the heat of protests from different parts of the country, 
modified their morning programming. 
</P>
<P>
One significant addition was a second on-screen ticker to give constant updates 
on the American and regional stock exchange prices. (The existing ticker gave 
prices on the New York Stock Exchange.) CNBC also added twice-an-hour updates 
on money market indexes. Both the second feature and the updates had been on 
FNN for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a brand-new service and we are still evolving," said Jim Boyle, 
spokesman for CNBC, headquartered in Fort Lee, N.J. "Our mandate is to be a 
much broader service than FNN, but we wanted to provide information to keep FNN 
watchers comfortable with us. Once they take a look at us we think they will be 
very happy with the service." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Pearlman had organized two meetings of a group she called 
Subscribers Allied for Viewing Excellence, or SAVE. They had two meetings, each 
of which was attended by 50 Cablevision subscribers, she said. SAVE members 
acknowledged that there had been changes at CNBC, but they still longed for 
FNN. 
</P>
<P>
"You get used to the on-air people," Pearlman said. "That's the main thing. You 
get so that you know them, trust them." 
</P>
<P>
"That is the one thing we could not change," said Belcher, who had high praise 
for Pearlman and the other protesters. "They had what they felt was a 
legitimate concern and they went about it the right way. They are intelligent, 
eloquent people who were willing to listen to our side of the story. It was 
truly a grass-roots movement." 
</P>
<P>
On June 8, after conferring with his home office, Belcher called Pearlman to 
tell her that West Valley Cablevision was keeping CNBC, but that it was also 
going to put FNN back on a separate channel from midnight to 4:30 p.m., long 
enough for full stock exchange coverage. In return, he asked her to call off 
planned picketing of the West Valley Cablevision offices. Pearlman readily 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
FNN rejoined the West Valley Cablevision lineup on June 12 and FNN officials 
were, of course, delighted. Meister said several other cable operators have 
restored FNN, including ones in Las Vegas; Springfield, Mo.; Westchester 
County, N.Y.; and Oakland County, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at CNBC said they were not at all dismayed with the decision. They 
said they are glad to be on Cablevision Industries systems and are sure, with 
time, that their operation will prove popular to a wider audience than FNN's. 
</P>
<P>
The only partial loser in the battle is West Valley Cablevision. "We have a 
limited amount of channel space, so we don't like to duplicate services," 
Belcher said. "Now I have two cable financial channels and I am paying three 
times what I was before." 
</P>
<P>
But all the time he was saying this, Belcher was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that the customers are happy and I think that 
eventually having CNBC will help us. But if I had to do this all over again, I 
don't think we would have made the switch."

MOSCOW NIGHTS ILLUSTRATES THE HAZARDS OF AUTHENTICITY

<P>
The Soviet Union is a country to visit for, among other things, its people, its 
exotic sights, its folk dances and its music, but not for its food. The same 
can rightly be said for Moscow Nights, a large Russian banquet restaurant in 
Reseda. On weekend nights, it's alive with music and dance and often festive 
parties of 70 or so celebrating a wedding, an anniversary or a birthday. But 
although the food may be up to Russian standards, it's not up to ours. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Nights is actually surprisingly similar to a comparable restaurant in 
Russia (except that the service is far better here). This is less a result of 
the decor and food than it is of the spirited entertainment you'll find there 
on weekend evenings. 
</P>
<P>
Grisha Diamant, emcee, guitarist and leader of a small band, would fit 
comfortably into a 1905 Russian version of "Beetlejuice." Dressed in 
pre-revolutionary peasant garb and with ample hair (as electrified as his 
guitar) wiring out from around a bald spot, he accompanies the Karamazov 
Sisters (more about them later) in Russian folk songs and does some pretty mean 
solos worthy of Chet Atkins. His comic patter (in English, with occasional 
multilingual jokes) provides diverting bridges between musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But the entertainment is only half the fun. The other diners, especially the 
celebratory Russians, can be equally entertaining. One evening, banquet guests, 
joined by other diners, bounded out of their seats to do a vigorous Armenian 
folk dance. After a hearty hora, they then stood back to watch a young couple 
do a breath-taking kazatzka, which is danced close to the floor. And the Lindy 
that followed wasn't hard on the eyes, either. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, my guest and I had consumed the appetizers, a couple of which 
were so good that they would have been welcome as encores later in the meal, 
and others that in vaudeville days would have gotten the hook. The boiled 
dumplings, pelimeni, were best: Slavic won-tons, little packets of seasoned 
chopped beef. The vareneki, thicker pastry wrapped around a tasty potato 
filling, were also good, although the ones filled with a ricotta-like cheese 
were dull. Pirozhki, baked Siberian turnovers, were wrapped in a flaky pastry 
but the beef filling was disappointingly under-flavored. 
</P>
<P>
We had high hopes for smoked fish with red caviar, but the best part turned out 
to be the boiled potatoes that came with it. The sliced fish seemed to have 
been sitting around before being served, and the red caviar was a sticky mess. 
The potatoes, however, were vibrant with butter, garlic and dill. 
</P>
<P>
When there wasn't dancing, there was singing. Not the customers this time, but 
a petite black-haired girl and a zaftig redhead billed as the Karamazov 
Sisters. Each of them gave effective performances of familiar Russian songs. 
However, Emma, the lusty redhead, also put across some terrific jazzy versions 
of American standards that reminded me of how intently American jazz is 
listened to in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the midst of all this fun -- and it was so much fun we even stood 
up to get a full view of the kazatzka -- the main courses arrived. The less 
said about them the better. The beef stroganoff was covered with a brown gravy 
studded with hothouse mushrooms; the duck (stuffed, according to the menu, with 
apples and other things) was simply dry; lamb shashlik was none too moist, 
either. The best bet of the lot was a "mignon steak," which was tender and 
cooked just as ordered but not particularly flavorsome. We did not order the 
fish, which, the helpful waiter told us, was frozen. The vegetables were not 
pleasant. We ordered more boiled potatoes with dill. 
</P>
<P>
Over good coffee and indifferent dessert, we listened to the poignant wail of a 
fiddler newly arrived from Minsk, according to the emcee. It expressed the 
peculiar combination of sadness and exuberance that seems to be distinctively 
Russian. Some of the songs sung by Emma and her "sister" were affecting in a 
different way. "Podmoskovniye Vechera" ("Moscow Nights") was obviously 
appropriate, and no explanation is needed for their choice of Leonard 
Bernstein's "I Want to Be in America." 
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of the current changes in Soviet life, based on my experience 
in the Soviet Union, I think I'd still have more fun at Moscow Nights than I 
would in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: tomato and cucumber salad, $4.95; vareneki (potato), $6.95; 
pelimeni (beef), $6.95; mignon steak, $16.95.

'EL DORADO' EXHIBIT CELEBRATES GOLDEN STATE'S GOLDEN PAST; 
</P>
<P>
MUSEUM DISPLAYS MAJOR COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL ART 
</P>

Legend has it that King El Dorado floated on a golden barge on a golden lake in 
a kingdom where gold abounded. Thus, after gold was discovered in California in 
1848, it was little wonder that the state eventually earned the nickname "El 
Dorado." 
</P>
<P>
"El Dorado: Paintings of the Golden State from the California Historical 
Society," a new exhibit at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, pays tribute 
to California's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
The featured works of art do more than simply depict the miners who dreamed of 
finding the precious yellow metal. Instead, the paintings create a tapestry of 
California's rich history, weaving visions of 19th-Century landscapes, 
seascapes, settlers, vaqueros and more into an aesthetic -- and educational -- 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Americans have a hunger for a sense of connection to place and time," 
said Nathan Sumner, executive director of the California Historical Society, 
headquartered in San Francisco. "Seeing the paintings gives you a set of images 
that provides that connection. There seems to be an empty place in all of us, 
and a sense of history can fill that." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-seven oil paintings, watercolors and pencil sketches by 47 artists make 
up the exhibit. The earliest painting dates from 1795, while most are from 
1849-1900. The works are on loan from the permanent collection of the 
California Historical Society, a 118-year-old organization dedicated to public 
history programs, education and historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
There has never been such an extensive collection of California historical 
paintings assembled for a public exhibition, according to James Nottage, 
curator of the Autry museum, which opened in November. 
</P>
<P>
A work by Albert Bierstadt and two by William Hahn are probably the most 
recognizable in the show, Nottage said. German by birth, both artists studied 
in Dusseldorf, which during the mid-1800s was one of the world's leading 
academic centers for fine artists. 
</P>
<P>
It was nature's grandeur that served as a vital inspiration for the two men. 
For Bierstadt, scenes of mountains became something of a trademark. "On the 
Merced River," one of his paintings in the exhibit, is an example of his 
accuracy and skill in portraying colossal landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite Valley with its geological drama was a recurring subject in both 
artists' works. Yosemite was declared a natural preserve by President Abraham 
Lincoln in 1864, and within a few years, eager visitors were going over the 
terrain to enjoy the panoramic views. 
</P>
<P>
In 1874, Hahn painted "Yosemite Valley From Glacier Point," another work 
included in the "El Dorado" exhibit. The cluster of tourists gazing over the 
valley from the 4,000-foot-high vantage point is an indication of the site's 
popularity -- and also testimony to a changing California. The painting 
captures a pastoral California on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nottage said the artists in the show apparently wanted to document the 
wilderness, that was not their primary objective; a simple expression of beauty 
was. Still, the works provide insight into another era. 
</P>
<P>
For British-born James Walker, it was the old Hispanic culture that created 
intrigue and found its way onto his canvases. During the American Civil War, 
Walker achieved fame as a military painter, but had set up a studio in San 
Francisco by the early 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's subjects were the ostentatious vaqueros who roped and branded cattle 
while dressed in their colorful garb. Walker's brush helped make these ethnic 
cowboys unforgettable in such paintings as "Cattle Drive 1" and "Cattle Drive 
2," both on exhibit at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican-born Fortunato Arriola helped make the California coastlines of the day 
memorable, just as J. Lamson chronicled daily activities in the mining camps, 
Frederick Butman recorded the lives of Chinese immigrants in a fishing village 
and William Jewett, a renowned New York portrait painter, became a portraitist 
for the nouveau riche -- namely the new gold tycoons. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing all these pictures together is like being transported back into the 
past," Nottage said. "These artists have created a record to allow California 
to look at itself. It's a self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
"They're allowing us to see California the way it was a century ago," he said. 
"When we think of Western art, we think in terms of Remington and Russell. But 
this exhibit proves there's so much more." 
</P>
<P>
 "El Dorado: Paintings of the Golden State from the California Historical 
Society" is on exhibit through Nov. 19 at the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum, 4700 Zoo Drive, Los Angeles. For information, call (213) 667-2000.

CYCLISTS ANGRY OVER PLAN FOR FREEWAY PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego bicyclists, angry over what they call a broken promise by local 
officials to build an isolated bicycle path along California 52, plan to ask 
decision-makers this morning to quash a proposal allowing bicyclists to ride on 
the shoulder of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Assn. of Governments today most likely will grant just $110,000 
of the $335 million allocated for the 1991 freeway project for a bikeway, 
enough to designate a cycling path on the freeway's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the countywide Bicycle Coalition say the proposal, presented by 
a Sandag executive committee and officials from Caltrans, does not adequately 
protect bicyclists or encourage biking over driving, a key goal of city and 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parallel Route 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasts are requesting an estimated $6-million, 3- to 4-mile isolated 
bike path running parallel to the southern edge of the proposed California 52 
extension, from Santo Road to Mission Gorge Road near Santee. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any place that allows you to ride on shoulders of freeways in 
urban areas like this," said Ed Reilly, spokesman for the coalition. "What 
Sandag is really doing is not giving us any biking facility there at all." 
</P>
<P>
And if that's not agreeable, coalition members say, they'll compromise: $3 
million for the initial grading and preparation for a bike path, and a design 
of the highway extension that would allow two future bicycling bridges to be 
connected to traffic bridges across Oak and Spring canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Some City of San Diego officials have informally endorsed that idea, arguing 
that such preliminary development would cost much more if undertaken later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warned of Dangers 
</P>
<P>
"Only the most experienced cyclists would feel comfortable riding on the 
shoulders," said Michael Jackson, bicycle coordinator for the City of San 
Diego, who warned of the dangers involved in Sandag's proposal and possible 
reluctance of bicyclists to use it. "If we don't have a right-of-way and the 
grading done now, it's going to be a lot more expensive than $3 million to do 
it at a later date." 
</P>
<P>
Getting bikeways around the existing Route 52 west of Santo Road isn't as 
pressing, coalition members say. The city plans to build bikeways there in the 
future, and bicyclists have access to side streets in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag representatives say the problem is simple: lack of money. "It's a tough 
question. It isn't that we don't have sympathy for what they're saying. But we 
have to balance the needs of the whole community," said Lois Ewen, vice mayor 
of Coronado and chairwoman of Sandag. "With everything else going on, we just 
can't afford $3 million for their bottom-line position." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plea Made 
</P>
<P>
Sandag has urged Caltrans, which will orchestrate the construction of the Route 
52 extension, to leave room in its design for an isolated bike path in the 
future, Ewen said. 
</P>
<P>
But coalition members argue that the issue involves more than budget decisions. 
Bicyclists say they have been entitled to a Route 52 path since 1987, when 
Sandag garnered support from them for Proposition A, a measure that boosted 
local and state taxes, by promising part of its revenues to alternative 
transportation programs -- including the building of the path. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to us for support, and we told them what we wanted -- the path along 
52," said Reilly. "That's not what we're getting. No bicyclist in his right 
mind would have requested to ride on the shoulder of 52." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict stems from differing interpretations of the wording of Proposition 
A, which states only that all new highway projects funded with proposition 
revenue are required to "include provisions for bicycle use." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Routes 
</P>
<P>
Such a provision can be bicycle routes marked on a roadway by colored signs, 
bicycle lanes painted along the side or paths completely independent from the 
road, said Jackson. 
</P>

Sandag officials on Thursday acknowledged the proposal to allow bicyclists to 
ride on the shoulder of the road is both the cheapest and least desirable. But 
they argued that the commitment promised in Proposition A has been met. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody (involved) was guaranteed their dream project," said 
Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who represents the county in Sandag. "From my point 
of view, an isolated bicycle way is obviously preferred. But I think it's just 
one of those issues that everybody is faced with: You don't always get 
everything you want."

$108-MILLION EXTENSION COMPLETE; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO TROLLEY SET TO START EL CAJON RUNS 
</P>

The latest extension of the San Diego Trolley's East Line -- connecting the 
Spring Street station in La Mesa with the El Cajon Transit Center -- will go 
into service Saturday with a Community Ride Day. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Transit Development Board administrators and local officials plan 
to inaugurate the six-mile segment with a ribbon-cutting ceremony today. The 
new track completes the $108-million, 11.1-mile East Line extension. 
</P>
<P>
"MTDB is extremely pleased to expand the San Diego Trolley from a 24-mile to a 
30-mile system consisting of lines in two major travel corridors," MTDB 
Chairman James R. Mills said in a news release. "The San Diego community at 
large should take credit for supporting innovative ideas to solve our regional 
transportation problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Began in November, 1986 
</P>
<P>
Work on the latest extension began in November, 1986, and was scheduled to be 
completed by July, 1989. "MTDB is proud that, like the South Line and the first 
two East Line segments, our third project is opening ahead of schedule and 
under budget," MTDB General Manager Thomas F. Larwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The 11.1-mile extension from Euclid Avenue to the El Cajon Transit Center is 
MTDB's first to be built with federal money. The total budget of $108 million 
-- $58 million in federal funds -- paid for the installation of the tracks, 
electrical lines and eight new stations, as well as 15 air-conditioned cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
System Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
East County public officials welcomed the trolley system's arrival into their 
communities. "The East Line gives our residents an alternative way to get to 
downtown San Diego besides driving on increasingly congested freeways," said El 
Cajon Mayor John Reber. 
</P>
<P>
East Line trolleys, running at 15- and 30-minute intervals, are expected to 
ferry 15,000 riders a day by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Rides on the new segment during the Community Ride Day Saturday are free, and 
entertainment will be provided at the stations. Fare service begins Sunday.

MAYOR ASKS GOVERNOR FOR MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after she was formally rebuffed by Gov. George Deukmejian, Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor wrote a reply Thursday, asking for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The governor told the mayor Tuesday that he would not consider her request for 
a one-time grant of $34 million to help the city through what O'Connor and the 
City Council have labeled a "state of emergency" caused by drug- and 
gang-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor had wanted Deukmejian to declare a similar state of emergency in 
order to release the funds from a new-found state budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter to the governor, O'Connor said: "While you are justifiably proud 
of your law enforcement record with respect to San Diego, the fact is that we 
are still losing the war to the criminal element. 
</P>
<P>
"I would argue that San Diego is using all available resources to combat the 
problem 'wisely and efficiently to protect the public safety' (the governor's 
words) and is daily losing ground." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said she had discussed the situation with federal officials, and that 
they, state officials and local representatives must work together to remedy 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to show you San Diego's problem but, if your schedule does not 
allow a visit here, I am more than willing to meet you at the time and place of 
your choosing," the mayor said. ARMANDO ACUNA

DIVESTITURE PLAN WOULD MAINLY AFFECT 1 COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to bar Los Angeles Planning Commission members from owning land in 
the city -- other than their homes -- would most directly affect one 
commissioner who owns eight properties in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members Joy Picus and Joel Wachs said their proposal was triggered 
by the recent disqualification of the five-member commission from hearing the 
controversial $2-billion development plan proposed for Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was disqualified because one of the eight properties owned by 
Commissioner Theodore Stein Jr. of Encino is near the project site in 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Three other commissioners report owning no real estate other than their homes. 
A fifth member, Suzette Neiman of Encino, reported two property investments, 
but three of four recent disqualifications involving her were because of her 
position on the boards of two trusts. 
</P>
<P>
Neiman said Thursday that she plans to resign in August from the Horace Heidt 
Trust and the Cal State Northridge Trust Fund to avoid conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and Wachs said they made the divestiture proposal to prevent appointed 
citizens from being disqualified from hearing important land-use cases such as 
the Porter Ranch plan, in which a developer wants to build about 3,000 homes 
and an office and retail complex on 1,300 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Referred Powers, a body of five council members, heard the case 
instead Wednesday, gave it preliminary approval and sent it to a council 
committee. Picus and Wachs bemoaned the loss of citizen involvement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal Criticized 
</P>
<P>
But their divestiture proposal was immediately criticized by Planning 
Commission members who said it would go too far. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous," said Neiman, adding that she will regret resigning from the 
trusts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a minute number of cases where the commission is 
disqualified," Stein said. He said he has heard 540 cases since his appointment 
in October and has been disqualified only three times. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and Wachs said the importance of some of those cases, such as Porter 
Ranch, should be the overriding consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Porter Ranch is really quite major," Wachs said. The commission's replacement 
by council members who will vote twice on the project "looks bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stein appears to have the greatest potential for a conflict of interest on the 
commission. A conflict by only one member forces the disqualification of the 
entire commission, Assistant City Atty. Anthony S. Alperin said. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's eight properties, according to a statement of economic interest he 
filed last year, are two condominium developments, three apartment buildings, 
an industrial and office complex, an office building and a 19-home tract about 
a mile from Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's ownership of the 19-home tract resulted in Alperin's decision to 
disqualify the commission from hearing the Porter Ranch plan. A stoplight 
called for in that proposal would be next to Stein's tract. 
</P>
<P>
Neiman's economic interest statement disclosed an investment of at least 
$100,000 in Stein's housing tract and in a commercial building in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President William G. Luddy and members William R. Christopher and 
Fernando Torres-Gil reported owning no property other than their homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Planning Commission has been disqualified from 13 
cases, including Porter Ranch, city records show. Three of the cases involved 
Stein, four involved Neiman and one involved Christopher because of his 
activity with a homeowners group. The others involved members no longer on the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
At a Planning Commission meeting last month, commissioners poked fun at the 
close scrutiny that has enveloped them. The issue at hand concerned a cemetery 
in Mission Hills. After Neiman disclosed that his father-in-law is buried 
there, Luddy joked that the commission should send the city attorney to the 
cemetery "to discuss it with those involved."

AREA PLAN REVISION INCHES SLOWLY AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
WILMINGTON, HARBOR CITY WAITING 6 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than six years ago, at the bidding of harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores, the Los Angeles City Council ordered a major revision of the community 
plan for Wilmington and Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
It's still not ready. 
</P>
<P>
And this week city officials acknowledged that it could take another year 
before the revisions are approved by the City Council, making it one of the 
most protracted plan revisions ever. 
</P>
<P>
The antiquated plan, one of 35 throughout the city, serves as a blueprint for 
what can and cannot be built in the two harbor-area communities. It was written 
in the late 1960s when now-standard environmental reviews of such plans were 
not required, leaving developers free to build factories next to single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan, when it is done, will bring with it new rules for building 
that should better protect residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Officials offer any number of explanations for the delays, ranging from snags 
involving the neighboring Port of Los Angeles to complications stemming from 
the area's unusual patchwork of industrial and residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Several sources, however, said most of the problems can be traced to a trite 
yet fundamental City Hall adage: The squeaky wheel gets the grease. For most of 
the six years, they said, Wilmington/Harbor City was not regarded as a priority 
within the Planning Department, in part because of political pressures from 
other areas of the city and because of Flores' own reluctance to lean on the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Revisions of community plans in both Westwood and Hollywood were authorized by 
the City Council after Flores won approval for the Wilmington/Harbor City 
revision, but work on those plans is already finished. The City Council 
approved the new Westwood plan in January, 1988, and the Hollywood plan in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Flores finally got fed up with the delays on the 
Wilmington/Harbor City plan, the department doubled its staff assigned to the 
plan and set such an ambitious schedule for itself that the plan was incomplete 
when presented to the city's Planning Commission for review in April. Next 
Thursday, the commission is scheduled to give the revisions a second look. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responds to Noisy Wheels 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Topping, the director of planning, has admitted publicly to the City 
Council that he responds to noisy wheels," Flores said in an interview this 
week. "I try to work with the departments. . . . In this case, that may have 
been an unfortunate choice on my part." 
</P>
<P>
As an indication that the Planning Department will need more time, the City 
Council voted Tuesday to extend for up to one year a 3-year-old construction 
ban on large apartment buildings in the two communities. The temporary ban was 
first imposed in early 1986 to put a lid on construction while the city 
finished the revised plan. It was intended to last one year. 
</P>
<P>
Once the plan revisions (and accompanying zoning changes needed to put the new 
plan in effect) clear the Planning Commission, they must be reviewed by the 
council's Planning and Environment Committee and then by the full City Council. 
If the committee makes major changes, they must be sent back to the commission 
for scrutiny before being forwarded to the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Summer of Next Year' 
</P>
<P>
"The very soonest I see it all coming together is roughly the end of this 
year," said Don Taylor, a city planner assigned to the plan revision. "But it 
is more likely it will run through the summer of next year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Flores of the delays: "If I had to do it over again, the first thing I 
would do is map out a timetable . . . and make them stick to it. I never want 
this to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the Wilmington/Harbor City plan has been a difficult one. An 
increasing awareness among Wilmington residents about problems in the community 
has prompted unprecedented demands for reform. Residents have called for 
commercial and recreational access to the heavily industrial waterfront, 
revitalization of downtown Wilmington, a scaling back of industrial uses in 
residential areas and an end to large apartment construction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Port of Los Angeles, eager to capitalize on booming Pacific Rim 
trade, has been reluctant to loosen its grip on the community by setting aside 
waterfront berths for uses not related to the port or eliminating unsightly 
storage yards for shipping containers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Wilmington and parts of Harbor City are unusual because of the 
magnitude of incompatible land uses and the need to come up with solutions to 
deal with that," said city planner Larry Friedman, who worked on the plan 
revisions for more than three years. "In Westwood, they were looking at things 
like limiting floor area of projects. In Wilmington, we were looking at 
significant changes of uses as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Biggest Obstacle 
</P>
<P>
But even with the difficulties, Friedman and others said the biggest obstacle 
has been one of manpower. Friedman said he was the only planner assigned to the 
revisions during most of his tenure -- and even then he had other 
responsibilities. Several City Hall sources said allocation of staff is the 
clearest indication of Planning Department priorities. Currently, there are 
four staff members assigned to the plan revision. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of pressure -- and screaming people -- to move forward with 
Hollywood and Westwood," one city official said. "And there was a lot of 
development pressure. In terms of Wilmington, there is not a lot of development 
there. It didn't have the same urgency." 
</P>
<P>
The staff shortage was worsened by the department's decision not to hire 
outside consultants to assist with the work until last July. Consultants were 
hired early in the process in both the Westwood and Hollywood plan revisions. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Officer Glenn Blossom, who until recently oversaw community plan 
revisions, said the department waited so long to hire outside help because it 
was trying to save money. 
</P>
<P>
Blossom said the department wanted to hire the same consultant to do 
environmental reviews for both the Wilmington/Harbor City plan and a separate 
transportation plan now under way for the Port of Los Angeles. "Hassles with 
the port over the details" of the transportation plan led to unexpected delays, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cheaper to Consolidate' 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were paying for a consultant for the port area, we thought it would 
be cheaper for the city to consolidate it," Blossom said. "While it was 
cheaper, we paid the price in a lengthy downtime." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Mendoza, president of Wilmington's largest homeowners group and a member 
of the now-defunct citizens advisory panel on the plan revisions, said the 
city's handling of the plan is indicative of general attitudes at City Hall 
toward Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a big commercial center going up or a bunch of affluent lawyers 
or doctors well positioned in the community to put on pressure," Mendoza said. 
"What we do have are a lot of interested and concerned residents." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the frustration, Flores said there has been an unexpected bonus 
from the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"As it dragged on, more and more people became aware of it, so there was more 
input," Flores said. "I don't suggest that as a way of getting more community 
input. I would rather have had the plan done earlier. But in the long run, 
people won't be able to say they haven't had an opportunity to be heard."

P.V. ESTATES CITY MANAGER IS FIRED WITHOUT WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council abruptly fired City Manager Gordon 
Siebert on Thursday, a week before his contract was due to expire. The council 
gave no reason for the decision, which was made at closed council personnel 
sessions before and after a morning budget meeting. Siebert, 38, who came to 
the city on July 1, 1985, was paid $63,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The council named Finance Director Bill Yeomans, 45, as temporary acting city 
manager. "That means I'll keep the boat moving," said Yeomans, who joined the 
city staff in January. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ruth Gralow said the vote to fire Siebert was 4 to 1, with Councilman 
James R. Nyman dissenting. She would not comment on what prompted Siebert's 
firing, but some City Hall staffers and a person who spoke to Siebert said the 
action surprised Siebert and the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Some other council members declined comment. Councilman Raymond D. Mattingly 
said attorneys for the city had advised them not to discuss the situation. 
Nyman could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Siebert was said to be in meetings and preparing to leave City Hall Thursday 
afternoon and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The council said in a statement that it "is actively seeking both an interim 
and permanent city manager to fill the position as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Gralow said Siebert has been on a year-to-year contract and that the current 
agreement expires at the end of June. She said Siebert will be paid a financial 
settlement but said the amount had not been clarified. 
</P>
<P>
She said the council, at its meeting Tuesday, will publicly confirm "action 
taken in closed session." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to coming to Palos Verdes Estates, Siebert was public works director in 
neighboring Rancho Palos Verdes. He also administered PV Transit, a 
transportation service in three Palos Verdes Peninsula cities.

AFTER 27 YEARS, GARDENA LAUNCHES $1.2-MILLION ROWLEY PARK PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the first phase of the Rowley Park Community Center was built, the Gardena 
neighborhood around it, known as Hollypark, was a tract of new homes whose 
residents were prosperous transplants from other communities. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena city officials envisioned then that Rowley Park's second phase, a 
gymnasium, would soon follow, when the city came up with the money to build it. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
This week, city officials finally broke ground on the project, a $1.2-million 
effort that will include a new gymnasium and classrooms and refurbished 
facilities. The 17-acre park includes the community center, four baseball 
diamonds and tennis and basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year delay, a product of financing problems, was finally resolved after 
the city sold $2.25 million in bonds in 1986 to pay for improvements at the 
park, at the civic center and at the city's public works building. Last year, 
the city also finished paying off bonds used to finance construction of City 
Hall and the civic center fire station in 1962 and 1964. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling Like a Stepchild 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we've wanted for a really long time," said Gilbert Stokes, 
president of the Hollypark Homeowners Assn. "A lot of people from Hollypark 
have had to go to the civic center, in the heart of the city, for some 
activities. There was a feeling that Hollypark was not really part of the 
Gardena community, that it was a stepchild." 
</P>
<P>
The only city-run gym, Rush Gymnasium on 162nd Street, is in downtown Gardena 
near City Hall, too far for Hollypark youngsters to go unchaperoned, residents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rush gym is booked all the time," said Les Phillips, the city's director 
of recreation and human services. "The second (city) gym at Rowley will allow 
us to offer more programs, more classes and more facilities for community 
meetings and activities." 
</P>
<P>
At least 64,000 people attend the Rowley Park center each year for community 
group meetings, exercise classes and baseball and softball games, said Kathy 
Walker, a senior recreation supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor facilities at Rowley Park will remain open this summer, throughout the 
renovation, Walker said. During the long wait for its new gymnasium, Hollypark 
has remained much the same as it was 27 years ago. Although the ethnic makeup 
of the neighborhood has changed from mostly white to 85% black, it is still a 
prosperous, quiet, middle-class community of four- and five-bedroom homes with 
neatly manicured lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Most residents are members of the Hollypark Homeowners Assn., a civic-minded 
community group whose members regularly address the City Council on various 
issues. The group holds annual block parties and other functions throughout the 
year so that longtime neighbors can keep in contact and new residents can get 
to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
But time has brought changes, too, and Hollypark homeowners are concerned about 
the encroachment of gangs, crime and violence from surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Because of those fears, improvements at the park are especially welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Kai Parker, a 20-year Hollypark resident and community activist, said the new 
gym will provide recreation for youngsters in north Gardena, keeping them off 
the street and keeping crime low in Hollypark. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who raised her two sons in the neighborhood, has joined other Hollypark 
residents in frequently addressing the City Council on their concerns about 
potential crime in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're a crime-infested part of the city, but the concerns of the 
people are legitimate," Parker said. "We are at the boundaries of several 
cities that have obvious crime problems. We buffer Hawthorne, Inglewood, 
Lennox, the (unincorporated) county area and the city strip." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
800 Signed Petition 
</P>
<P>
At a recent City Council meeting, the homeowners group presented a petition 
with about 800 signatures in support of increasing the Police Department budget 
and adding 13 officers to the force. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, association president Stokes cited a gang-related shooting on 
May 19 near Rosecrans and Normandie avenues, about a mile east of Hollypark. A 
16-year-old member of a Gardena gang was beaten and fatally shot in a 
confrontation between two rival gangs. The victim's death on June 10 was 
Gardena's first confirmed gang-related death, said Lt. Ross Weddle, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes said more youth activities in the area could help prevent such 
tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, crime in Hollypark is no worse than in other areas of 
Gardena and in fact has decreased since 1980, Police Chief Richard Propster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 19.4% of Gardena's population of 50,000 live in Hollypark, Propster said. 
In 1980, 23.4% of the city's major crimes occurred in that area, but by 1988, 
that figure had decreased to 17.5%, he said. In 1988, the number of major 
crimes citywide, including homicide, burglary, rape and robbery, was 2,747, 
Propster said. Of those, 481 were committed in Hollypark. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mas Fukai, who runs or jogs at Rowley Park almost every weekend, 
said it is safe and well-run. Fukai, who worked with the homeowners group and a 
city-appointed committee on plans for the park, said it has an unfounded 
reputation as a haven for crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Hollypark wouldn't allow it," Fukai said. "They would chase them 
out."

CALL TOUR 'STAGED SHOW';

<P>
CRITICS ACCUSE LANDFILL OF CLEANING UP ITS ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Only one thing was missing Thursday afternoon when California Waste Management 
Board officials toured Lopez Canyon Landfill to prepare for a hearing today on 
the dump's operating permit: the trash. 
</P>
<P>
Little patches of household garbage at the top of the Los Angeles city dump 
were being neatly covered with dirt. A few stray papers wafted here and there, 
but landfill workers swiftly snapped them up with spike-tipped poles. 
</P>
<P>
"That mountain you see on your left is 1.1 million tons of trash," said John de 
la Rosa, landfill manager and official tour guide. But when many of the tour 
participants leaned forward to look, they saw a mountain ridge that had long 
since sprouted grass and small shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Residents nearest the dump -- who live in Lake View Terrace, Pacoima and Kagel 
Canyon neighborhoods -- joined the tour and swelled the sightseers to more than 
100. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picture Incomplete 
</P>
<P>
They said that the picture of the landfill presented to the group was 
incomplete and that the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation had cleaned house for 
the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, the working face of the dump is three times what we saw today. The 
trash is much thicker -- up to a 10-foot wall of trash up to 200 feet long," 
said Rob Zapple, a member of the Kagel Canyon Civic Assn. and a frequent 
landfill critic. "And the amount of traffic going on up there is usually much 
heavier. I don't think we saw one garbage truck releasing its load." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who also took the two-hour tour, called it 
a staged show. Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) said the dump 
wasn't so clean during a previous visit. 
</P>
<P>
De la Rosa called the beautification charges lies. William Knapp, manager of 
refuse collection and disposal for the city, said state law requires the 
landfill to promptly cover trash. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say what you're seeing now is typical of how we operate," Knapp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the only disagreement that arose during the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Mal Toy, assistant director of the Bureau of Sanitation, said trucks typically 
stop arriving about 3 p.m., when the tour started. Zapple and other neighbors 
said they see and hear full trucks arriving until 5 or 6 p.m. on many days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wall of Trash 
</P>
<P>
Knapp said grading, drainage pipes and a catch basin added to the face closest 
to Kagel Canyon after a wall of trash washed down streets in 1983 would prevent 
a similar accident. 
</P>
<P>
But Kagel Canyon resident Dennis Ghiatis brought photographs that he said were 
taken in 1987 that showed the basin not draining properly and the graded hills 
beginning to erode after a light rainfall. He said that in a rainy year, Kagel 
Canyon could be in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
These drastically different perceptions of the dump will be sorted through by 
the Waste Management Board during its first hearing on the dump's permit, set 
for 10 a.m. today at Glendale City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill was issued a state permit in 1978, but because of an oversight, 
the permit was never renewed, said Chris Peck, Waste Management Board 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Several basic permit requirements do not reflect current operations, Peck said. 
The permit states that the volume of trash dumped there should be 8,000 tons a 
month, but the city dumps 4,000 tons a day. Another issue is landfill height, 
which the permit sets at a maximum 1,725 feet but has hit 1,764 feet, according 
to city tabulations, and is still growing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the eight-member board had planned to review the city's proposed 
permit changes during its regular meeting in Sacramento. But Peck said the 
volume of local opposition and concern about the dump, which increased when two 
landfill workers fainted March 8 after breathing toxic fumes, caused the board 
to set a public hearing in Los Angeles instead. 
</P>
<P>
Although no decision on the permit will be made until mid-July, board Chairman 
John E. Gallagher said he was impressed by what he saw Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a well-run landfill," he said. "We'd be hard put to criticize as 
a result of this tour." 
</P>
<P>
When he was told about the neighbors' allegations, Gallagher said: "If there's 
a question in the mind of anybody that this was spring cleaning, they should 
raise that issue . . . either here or at the hearing."

TEST TUBE PROVES FRUITFUL FOR COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When David and Luz Barragan turned to in vitro fertilization five years into a 
childless marriage, they had no idea it would come to this. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Guadalajara, Mexico, couple became the proud parents of a set 
of healthy quadruplets. Luz Adriana, Citali, Diego and David were born at 9:30 
p.m. at UC San Diego Medical Center, according to a hospital spokeswoman. The 
newborns' weights ranged from 3 pounds to 3 pounds, 10.5 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy and relieved because there was a lot of risk," David Barragan 
said Thursday. "Now the worries are about fatherhood." 
</P>
<P>
But these days, the risks associated with such a pregnancy are minimal, said 
Dr. Thomas Moore, director of the center's perinatal division. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of bearing quadruplets, normally 1 in 10,000, increase with the use of 
in vitro, or test tube, fertilization, Moore said.

'CAREER' BURGLAR SENTENCED TO 34-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man with 12 previous burglary convictions, some dating as far back as 1973, 
was sentenced Thursday to 34 years in state prison for attempting to burglarize 
a Mission Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Perry, 32, of Pacoima probably will serve about half that time, said San 
Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Perry was arrested Dec. 16, 1987, after he broke into the home of Daniel 
Rohrbach, a Cal State Northridge student, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman F. 
Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Rohrbach arrived home while Perry was inside. He 
grabbed a gun and ordered Perry into the bathroom, where he hoped to keep him 
until police arrived, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry tried to escape. The two men then wrestled over control of the gun, court 
documents said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual for someone to get 34 years for one burglary, but he was a 
career burglar," Montrose said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry had 27 arrests and 12 convictions for burglarizing homes throughout the 
San Fernando Valley, Montrose said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said she believed that Perry should have spent more time in state prison 
for some of his earlier convictions, which might have deterred him from 
continuing to burglarize homes. 
</P>
<P>
"You are articulate, you are intelligent and you have misapplied that," she 
said. "You have a tremendous capacity for good and you have wasted 10 or 12 
years of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Perry jumped bail twice between his latest burglary arrest and June 7, when he 
pleaded guilty to the burglary charge, Montrose said. Once, he was captured by 
a police officer who stopped him for a traffic violation; the second time, he 
was found by a bounty hunter working for a bail bondsman, Montrose said.

MEETING TO DISCUSS TOXIC CLEANUP EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials have set a public meeting Wednesday to explain 
their efforts to clean up contaminated soil and water at two plants operated by 
a defense contractor in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes in response to allegations that toxic chemicals illegally 
dumped by Space Ordnance Systems in Mint Canyon and Sand Canyon led to four 
cancer deaths in a single family. The meeting will be held at 4 p.m. in Santa 
Clarita City Hall, 23920 Valencia Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting will be members of a task force of citizens, health 
officials and company representatives organized after the contamination was 
discovered in 1984. Also attending will be members of a monitoring committee 
that has overseen cleanup efforts at the plants.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL JOBS PROGRAM IS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Centinela Valley Union High School District has approved a youth employment 
pilot program, one of two in California to be provided by the nonprofit Jobs 
for America's Graduates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. McKinley Nash announced he will appoint a committee to implement 
the program, which will provide youth employment services and coordinate the 
district's existing vocational, work-experience and Job Training Partnership 
Act programs. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the new program is designed to reduce dropouts, increase the 
graduation rate and provide stable, quality jobs for "at-risk" youngsters. The 
typical participant is a high school senior who comes from a low-income family 
or is a member of a racial or ethnic minority, has a C-minus or lower 
grade-point average and little or no employment experience. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs for America's Graduates has assisted more than 70,000 young people in 14 
states in getting jobs. The State Board of Education recently approved the 
organization's plans to start programs in California, according to district 
officials.

PROSPECT OF RETURNING HOME FRIGHTENS CHINESE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raymond Chen had a goal when he moved to the United States from Shanghai three 
years ago: to return home someday with skills that would enhance his country's 
quest to become modern. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us (students) are trying to help China's economy," said Chen, 25, a 
graduate student in electrical engineering at UC Berkeley who allowed his name 
to be used because he said he believes it is already on a government blacklist. 
"I think most people planned to go back -- or at least to help China if they 
went back or not." 
</P>
<P>
Going home has become a frightening prospect, however, for many of the 40,000 
Chinese studying in the United States since the political crackdown in their 
native country. And that poses a dilemma for the Chinese economy: The permanent 
absence of these scholars would mean a sacrifice of skills in science, 
engineering, business and other fields where advanced knowledge is in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential impact is very substantial," said D. Gale Johnson, a specialist 
in agricultural economics at the University of Chicago. "Once again, the 
Chinese will have wasted the best of a generation, as they did in the Cultural 
Revolution. These students are some of the best and brightest, and I think the 
majority of them will be very reluctant to go back." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the recent crackdown, many of China's foreign scholars had 
postponed their return, choosing instead to save money, improve their English 
and exercise newly acquired skills in U.S. laboratories and workplaces. But 
many students viewed this brain drain as short-term, maintaining that 
ultimately they would go home. 
</P>
<P>
Since the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Beijing's Tian 
An Men Square, however, some of China's most able students are re-examining 
where they will live and use their training. Already, the U.S. government has 
obliged to some extent, announcing that Chinese students may stay in the United 
States for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely want to stay here for as long as I can," said a UCLA graduate 
student from China who asked not to be identified by name for fear that Chinese 
authorities would retaliate against his family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sudden Flood of Chinese 
</P>
<P>
The economic dilemma is rooted in an unusual experiment launched by China's 
leaders in the late 1970s. Suddenly, after years of restricting U.S. study, 
they allowed tens of thousands of Chinese students to come here, mostly at the 
graduate level. The effort was extraordinary in scope: In just a decade, the 
Chinese became the largest cadre of foreign students in the United States, 
according to the Institute of International Education in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of students has been spectacular, and the increase in a short 
period of time has been astounding," said Lowell Dittmer, a political science 
professor and China specialist at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment yielded positive results quickly. U.S.-educated engineers have 
become common at large Chinese construction enterprises, for example. By some 
estimates, American universities have furnished more than half the scientific 
doctoral degrees now held in China. Since 1979, 20,000 students have returned 
after U.S. studies, according to Chinese government figures, some gaining 
influential roles in government and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, in the fields of science and technology, there's no question that 
people who have studied in America have had a great impact," said Leo A. 
Orleans, a China scholar and consultant to the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But in many ways, China's investment in foreign study -- financed in large part 
by the host American institutions -- has yet to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Often, returning students and scholars have been given tasks far below their 
level of training because of the economy's limitations. Some holders of 
doctoral degrees, for instance, serve as guides and translators because they 
speak English. In other cases, Chinese institutions simply cannot afford the 
advanced scientific equipment that students took for granted in high-tech U.S. 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some who returned have been bitterly disappointed at the work 
awaiting them. Many others, mindful of such complaints, have postponed going 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't have all the things you need to do the work," complained a 
Chinese engineering student at Berkeley, who also asked not to be identified. 
"They don't have the equipment. If I don't have these computers, I can't do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA graduate student argued that Chinese institutions often undermine 
those with foreign training. To make the point, he drew an unfavorable 
comparison to a famous Santa Monica think-tank: "If there was a RAND Corp. in 
China, who do you think would be the head of it?" asked the student, 25. "It 
would be someone with an elementary school education, an idiot." 
</P>
<P>
About 73,000 Chinese have received visas to study in this country since 1979, 
according to official U.S. figures. Currently, more than 29,000 are pursuing 
degrees, mainly at the Ph.D. level and most often in science, mathematics and 
engineering. Another 10,000 Chinese scholars are here in non-degree programs, 
according to the Institute of International Education. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 73,000 awarded U.S. visas, perhaps 10,000 are unaccounted for, said 
Peggy Blumenthal, a vice president with the nonprofit institute. "Either they 
didn't come here or they're in some (immigration) status that's uncountable," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there have been various accounts that Chinese officials sought 
to rein in students who failed to go home. Reports have circulated widely that 
officials planned to impose monetary penalties against their families and to 
set clear-cut limits on how long students could remain abroad. Despite such 
reports, which reached a crescendo last year, Chinese officials seemed to stay 
lenient, at least until recently. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, a lot of the students got worried," recalled Susan L. Shirk, a 
China specialist at UC San Diego. But when the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles 
continued to show flexibility, she said, "the students relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
For those who have gone home, a different set of issues has emerged: Does China 
really need a continued influx of advanced scientists at this modest stage of 
its economic development? 
</P>
<P>
While its top scholars wrestle with questions about state-of-the-art physics, 
China's economy has wrestled with 20% inflation, energy shortages and rising 
unemployment in the countryside. Despite a booming 10% growth rate in recent 
years, China remains far from developed in most regions. 
</P>
<P>
It is most noted for such low-tech industries as toys and textiles; foreign 
investors often view it as a place to assemble things made elsewhere. China 
competes with such relatively undeveloped nations as Thailand and the 
Philippines for foreign investment. Neighbors such as Hong Kong use it as a 
source of cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
Given such realities, some experts argue that China would benefit if more 
foreign students pursued down-to-earth business skills, such as management and 
planning, rather than prestigious science programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall idea of managing people seems not to be in their vocabulary," said 
Godwin Wong, a professor of business administration at Berkeley and a board 
member of a university in China's Henan province. 
</P>
<P>
But China's most heated issues surrounding foreign study these days have little 
to do with business and economics -- and everything to do with politics. 
</P>
<P>
This is because those returning have brought home more than technical training 
to help their country: They have brought the influence of such values as 
freedom, capitalism and the consumer-oriented life style of the Western world. 
Thus along with their new skills have come the seeds of political discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately or unfortunately, during the (education) process they also learned 
the American way of living -- which is not something that the elders back home 
have been exposed to," said Wong, whose family moved from mainland China to 
Hong Kong when he was a child in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
And that, it appears, has alienated the authoritarian government from many of 
its most talented students, and vice versa. As a result, politically active 
foreign students often fear that career opportunities back home have been 
harmed severely. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley's Chen said his early plans to help China's economy are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"If I cannot stay in this country," he said, "I'll probably go to other 
countries."

A 14-year-long impasse in the Angolan civil war was broken Thursday night when 
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and anti-Communist rebel leader Jonas 
Savimbi agreed to a formal cease-fire and promised to open peace talks on a 
government of national reconciliation. 
</P>

It was the first time that Dos Santos, an avowed Marxist, and Savimbi, 
president of the U.S.-backed National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola (UNITA), have met to try to negotiate an end to the war that has cost 
hundreds of thousands of lives and paralyzed the potentially wealthy former 
Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Day Summit 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire, to take effect at midnight tonight, was part of a declaration 
issued at the end of a one-day summit meeting of 18 African leaders, called to 
help resolve one of the region's bloodiest conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos and Savimbi sealed the agreement with a symbolic handshake. Details 
of the peace framework remained sketchy Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
President Moussa Traore of Mali, chairman of the Organization of African Unity, 
described the meeting at the luxury villa of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko 
as the beginning of a new era for Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The handshake symbolizes as from June 24 the end of civil war in Angola," 
Traore said. 
</P>
<P>
Angola and UNITA have declared cease-fires before, but Mobutu, who hosted the 
summit to follow up a first regional meeting of African leaders on Angolan 
peace in May, said, "This time it's more serious." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Savimbi's future was an issue that came up only at the 
summit's end. "These are really only questions of details," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports have suggested that Savimbi, whose South African- and U.S.-backed 
forces control large areas of Marxist Angola, might leave the country 
temporarily and abandon politics. 
</P>
<P>
The declared cease-fire in the Angolan civil war comes only weeks after 
Namibian rebels based in southern Angola ended a 17-year bush war with South 
Africa as part of a peace plan for the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Independence elections in Africa's last colony are scheduled to take place 
under United Nations supervision in November. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered Namibian peace deal also called for the withdrawal from 
Angola of 50,000 Cuban soldiers supporting the Luanda government in its fight 
against UNITA. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's declaration ending the summit in Gbadolite said that the next 
meeting of the African leaders on Angola will be held in Zimbabwe "in the very 
near future." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration also said that all Angolans will work for national 
reconciliation and that Mobutu will head a commission to monitor the overall 
progress toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this summit will create the basis for a return to peace in Angola," 
Mobutu told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, acting as spokesman for the summit, said 
after more than four hours of talks: "The heads of state of this summit . . . 
can now convey a message of hope to Angola for peace, eternal peace, unity and 
development." 
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, a spokesman for South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) 
Botha said that, while proper peace initiatives are always welcome, the 
government wants more official information on the Angolan talks before 
commenting. 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of the apparent success of the summit, Savimbi and Dos Santos 
sat near each other for a group photograph at Mobutu's villa. 
</P>
<P>
Their meeting marked a major diplomatic coup for Mobutu, who is due to visit 
Washington later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I have come in a spirit of openness," Savimbi, wearing a gray Mao-style jacket 
and carrying a swagger stick, said earlier when he arrived at this northern 
Zairean town, Mobutu's ancestral home. 
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's presence had been in doubt until the last minute. He and Dos Santos 
had both made statements earlier this week suggesting they did not intend to 
meet here. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Mobutu, Dos Santos, Traore and Kaunda, other leaders attending the 
summit were: President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and the heads of state of 
Burundi, Chad, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Botswana, Mozambique, Gabon, 
Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Sao Tome e Principe, Congo and Zimbabwe. 
Morocco and Tanzania sent lower-level officials.

Hundreds of civil rights activists boarded buses in Philadelphia, Miss., to 
retrace the trail of the 1960s Freedom Riders after honoring three civil rights 
workers who were slain near the Mississippi town 25 years ago. Some 470 
pilgrims had arrived in a caravan of 13 buses from New York and Philadelphia, 
Pa., to attend ceremonies Wednesday honoring the three workers. The next day, 
10 chartered buses left for Washington and additional ceremonies, with the 
caravan modeled on the North-to-South Freedom Rides of the 1960s.

The crippled oil tanker Exxon Valdez leaves Alaskan waters today for California 
on a 3,000-mile journey that will be the first major movement of the tanker 
since it ran aground three months ago, causing the biggest oil spill in U.S. 
history. "We're not expecting anything to go wrong," said Coast Guard Lt. Alan 
Carr. "The belief is that it's structurally sound enough to make the transit." 
No crude oil is on the Exxon Valdez; 11 million gallons spewed out of the 
ruptured hull when the ship ran aground March 24 and another 42 million gallons 
were pumped out. Exxon has promised to keep the damaged tanker 100 miles 
offshore until it reaches San Diego, where it will undergo a $25-million repair 
job at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co.

Avon Products Inc. said it has permanently stopped using animals in its product 
safety tests, becoming one of the first major cosmetics makers to do so. Animal 
rights activists praised Avon and said they hope its decision will encourage 
other companies to halt animal testing as a way of measuring a product's 
effectiveness and safety. The beauty products company said it will rely on 
alternative non-animal testing methods.

Bulgaria said that 250,000 ethnic Turks have applied to emigrate to Turkey and 
150,000 already have passports allowing them to leave. In Sofia, a deputy 
foreign minister said about 50,000 "Bulgarian Muslims" have crossed the border 
into Turkey in the past month. In keeping with Bulgarian practice, he refused 
to speak of ethnic Turks. The estimated 1 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria, 
about one-ninth of the country's population, have been forced to adopt 
Bulgarian names since 1984 and have seen their language and religion banned.

A small town in Iowa wants to boldly go where no one has gone before -- and 
erect a statue to a favorite son who hasn't even been born. Four years ago, 
Riverside, Iowa, lobbied to become the "small town in Iowa" where James T. 
Kirk, whose captainship of the spaceship Enterprise is enjoying its fifth 
go-round on film, is to be born on March 26, 2228. Super "Trekkie" Steve 
Miller, who came up with the proposal, received the blessing of Gene 
Roddenberry, creator of "Star Trek," and now Miller is working with Paramount 
Pictures to get permission to erect a bronze statue of Kirk in the town's park. 
The town already has its head in the stars, being host to a Trek Fest each 
year, with the fifth celebration coming at warp speed this weekend.

 -- A dog apparently blessed with a cat's nine lives showed up at a Mt. 
McKinley research camp 18 days after it was lost by a pair of French climbers 
sledding up the Alaskan mountain. Patricia and Jean-Francois Tuveri, of 
Chamonix, France, assumed the dog, part of a team of four, had fallen in a 
crevasse and died after disappearing May 31. After descending from the top of 
the mountain, only the second expedition using dogs to reach the summit, the 
Tuveris did some sightseeing around Alaska, then returned to pick up the dogs 
for the return to France. That's when they learned that Oukiok had turned up at 
a medical research camp on the mountain. The dog was uninjured but exhausted. 
Jim Leach, chief veterinarian for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, said snow 
and ice could have provided enough liquid to prevent the dog from dying of 
dehydration. ANN CONNORS

An airborne anti-drug assault team in Bolivia captured a suspected drug lord's 
security chief and four other men but was forced to retreat under heavy fire, 
Information Minister Hernan Antelo reported. Antelo said the 30-member task 
force of government security agents, carrying a warrant for the arrest of 
suspected narcotics trafficker Hugo Rivero Villavicencia, raided his home. But 
the team was forced to withdraw amid a gun battle with Rivero's guards and a 
small army of reinforcements. Antelo said one gunman was killed and that 
Astrugas Medina Villegas, believed to be in charge of security for Rivero, was 
among five people arrested.

Conn.-based Save the Children Federation, was taken by unknown kidnapers in 
Israel's occupied Gaza Strip. The kidnapers apparently demanded Israel release 
Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his freedom, Arab reports in Jerusalem 
said. Several hours after George's disappearance, the office of the Red Cross 
in Gaza received a ransom demand, Palestinian reports said. Some reports said 
it came in the form of a written letter in which the kidnapers demanded Israel 
release Palestinian detainees.

Iran has rejected several recent attempts by third countries to mediate with 
Washington, Iran's foreign minister was quoted as saying. Ali Akbar Velayati, 
interviewed in the Dubai-based Arabic newspaper Al Bayan, said Iran is 
interested in good foreign relations as long as that doesn't compromise its 
independence, Al Bayan reported. "Several countries have approached us for some 
kind of mediation with the United States. But we reject that as the Islamic 
republic in Iran has never welcomed such mediations," Velayati was quoted as 
saying.

The Alameda County Board of Supervisors has proposed to increase a countywide 
tax by up to $8 to help bail out the county's trauma care system. The system is 
"financially punishing the three participating hospitals," said Don Perata, 
chairman of the Board of Supervisors. "With this kind of support, no hospital 
gets rich providing trauma care, but we will finally have a solid program." The 
tax plan would provide $4 million a year for the trauma centers, set up to 
treat victims within the first critical hour of injury.

A prominent Israeli history professor was stabbed to death in Jerusalem, and 
police said they are investigating it as a possible political or terrorist 
attack. The body of Hebrew University Prof. Menachem Stern was found by 
schoolchildren in a park near Israel's Parliament building, a police spokesman 
said. Stern, 64, was stabbed several times in the chest, the spokesman said. He 
said robbery was ruled out as a motive because a watch and money were found on 
Stern's body. Asked whether terrorists were believed responsible, the spokesman 
said, "This direction is also being checked." Israel Television said two Arabs 
have been detained in the case. Stern, honored in Israel for academic 
excellence, had also lectured at Harvard and Oxford.

An abandoned Salinas hotel that once counted author John Steinbeck and many 
U.S. Presidents among its guests has been temporarily saved from the wrecker's 
ball. Monterey County Superior Court Judge John M. Phillips found that the city 
had failed to get an adequate environmental impact report before ordering the 
Cominos Hotel demolished. The downtown hotel, built in 1874 and modernized in 
1919, was often visited and mentioned by Steinbeck, a Salinas native whose 
fiction won the Nobel Prize for literature. The hotel recently fell on hard 
times and the City Council voted in April to raze it for a parking lot, an 
office building and a museum dedicated to Steinbeck. The Monterey County 
Historical Society sued to save the hotel, arguing that the city's 
environmental document was deficient.

DESPITE CONCERNS, ADMINISTRATION BACKS SWEEPING CIVIL RIGHTS BILL FOR DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, declaring that many disabled persons "lead their lives 
in an intolerable state of isolation and dependence," on Thursday declared its 
support, with some reservations, for a sweeping measure to extend key civil 
rights protections to those with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We must end the anomaly of widely protecting women and minorities from 
discrimination, while failing to provide parallel protection for people with 
disabilities," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh told the Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Persons with disabilities are still too often shut out of the economic and 
social mainstream of American life," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparisons With Reagan 
</P>
<P>
The Administration support was hailed by disabled rights lobbyists, who 
contrasted it with what they said was silence from the Ronald Reagan 
Administration on an earlier measure. There are more than 36 million disabled 
people in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators, many of them in wheelchairs, jammed the committee room for the 
hearing and sign language interpreters relayed the testimony to the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has 43 Senate co-sponsors, would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ban job discrimination against the disabled in businesses with at least 15 
employees. The protection covers those who, though handicapped, otherwise are 
qualified for the job. (Federal law currently bans such discrimination in 
federal agencies or for those receiving federal funds.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require employers to make reasonable accommodations for workers with 
disabilities, unless to do so would pose an undue hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outlaw discrimination against the disabled in places of public 
accommodations. The definition of such places would be broadened beyond the 
landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act's provisions for restaurants and hotels to 
include doctors' offices, supermarkets and drugstores. Access for the disabled 
would be required in any new structures, while for existing facilities only 
"readily achievable" structural changes would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require wheelchair lifts in new buses and special provisions by telephone 
companies to enable the deaf to communicate with regular telephone users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contagious Disease Issue 
</P>
<P>
The bill covers those with AIDS. It states that a person with a contagious 
disease or infection may be denied a job or benefit only if the employer can 
demonstrate that the person poses a significant health risk in the workplace or 
job site. If no reasonable accommodation by the employer can eliminate such a 
risk, the individual may be denied the position or benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh expressed concern that the bill might go beyond the definition of 
public accommodations used in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, saying that "we should 
make sure when we're sailing into unknown waters what the perils are." 
</P>
<P>
He also questioned the bill's provision of punitive damages to be used as a 
means of enforcement. "We are a litigious society, and, with a lot of people, 
the first thing they want to do is sue somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), the bill's principal sponsor, contended that 
litigation is more likely without the provision for damages, which would make 
compliance harder to achieve. In support of his position, he cited the damage 
provisions added by Congress last year to the Fair Housing Act. But Thornburgh 
noted that the fair housing provisions were added only after 20 years of 
experience with that law. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that the standard of "readily achievable" alterations in public 
accommodations required under the measure is "an undefined term" and said he 
preferred that changes not be required if they might cause "an undue financial 
and administrative burden," the standard used in the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973. Thornburgh questioned the impact that the bill would have on small 
businesses. He said he favors a standard that would apply the law to firms with 
more than 15 employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Because small businesses have limited financial resources, they do not have 
the advantage of spreading the costs of accommodations over a large payroll," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Administration's reservations, lobbyists for the disabled said that 
they were pleased by Thornburgh's testimony. After negotiations on a final 
version, passage of the disabled rights act seems likely this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any potential major areas of disagreement," said Pat A. Wright, 
who heads the Washington office of the Disabled Rights, Education and Defense 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>

Opportunity Commission, said: "It's an historic day. This is the first

FORMER HUD OFFICIALS' $133 MILLION IN GRANTS TERMED 'BEST FIX AROUND' 
</P>

<P>
Two former top officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
exploited inside connections at the agency to win approval of $133 million in 
lucrative rent subsidy grants in "the best fix around," House investigators 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Philip Abrams, former HUD undersecretary, and Philip Winn, former HUD 
assistant secretary in the Ronald Reagan Administration, insisted in 
congressional testimony that their expertise and the merit of their proposals 
accounted for their success. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the Government Operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing, countered that it was their political 
ties to Deborah Gore Dean, a powerful chief of staff to former HUD Secretary 
Samuel R. Pierce Jr., that made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Favoritism was used in allocation of extremely valuable and extremely scarce 
housing units," Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everybody Knew It' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) agreed, telling Abrams: "The whole key is 
Deborah Gore Dean. You knew it. Everybody knew it. It was the best fix around 
-- it was a no-lose situation." 
</P>
<P>
Dean has invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination but 
has indicated that she might testify later on her role in allocating grants 
under the HUD Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program if she is given access 
to HUD documents that she has requested. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams confirmed that he wrote three "Dear Debbie" notes to Dean in 1986 
seeking her help in getting the department to approve proposals for 
rehabilitation and rent subsidies for projects in Nevada, Oklahoma and 
Colorado. Two of the three requests were granted. 
</P>
<P>
In one note on behalf of the Housing Authority of Clark County, Nev., which 
later approved his rehabilitation program for 160 units, Abrams wrote Dean: 
"The bottom line is they need 160 units . . . . I would appreciate it if you 
could accommodate their request." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$19.8 Million in Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said that he bought an option to buy the Sierra Point apartments for 
$10,000 and that -- when the HUD award was announced -- he paid $3.4 million 
for the property. Under terms of the grant, he would receive $19.8 million in 
rent subsidies and $6 million in tax credits in return for rehabilitating the 
units for occupancy by low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
In all, a group led by Abrams and Winn received HUD approval for seven projects 
with a total of 1,347 units that qualified for rent subsidies of $133.6 million 
and tax credits worth an additional $29 million, according to the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Winn, now U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, defended his firm's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not our doing," he said of the HUD selection process, adding that the 
firm thought it was competing for the hard-to-get HUD allocations of 
rehabilitation units. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no competition," Shays told him. "You worked directly with Deborah 
Gore Dean and she signed off on it." 
</P>
<P>
"If Debbie says it was done on a political basis, maybe it was," Winn replied. 
"We are not the ones that chose the projects." 
</P>
<P>
Lantos said: "You used your influence and your influence got you the units." 
</P>
<P>
"It may very well be the case," Winn said, but he insisted that his associates 
did not break any rules in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, former HUD official Joseph Strauss said he had to hire James G. Watt, 
former secretary of the Interior, because he needed a "heavy hitter political 
consultant" to get contracts under the rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he hired Jerris Leonard, a prominent Republican attorney who 
headed the Justice Department's civil rights division in the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration, and other well-known Republicans to advance his clients' grant 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees for Watt 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said he personally earned nearly $1 million in six years as a 
consultant who did 80% of his business with HUD. Watt received a fee of 
$169,000 for interceding with Pierce on behalf of a rehabilitation project in 
Essex, Md., Strauss said, and was paid $120,000 for similar help on behalf of 
two other clients. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the rehabilitation program was riddled with mismanagement and 
influence-peddling in the past, Strauss replied: "Absolutely right." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his financial success, the former special assistant to Pierce said he 
is disillusioned with the Washington world of consulting and has moved to West 
Virginia.

SOVIET AIDS TOLL, MEDICAL SYSTEM LINKED

A 10-year-old boy, infected with the AIDS virus while being treated for a heart 
defect in a Soviet hospital, has died in the southern Russian city of Rostov -- 
the latest victim of the widespread use here of unsterilized syringes and other 
medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The case, reported by the government newspaper Izvestia on Thursday, was the 
third of its kind, according to Soviet officials, who now acknowledge that the 
AIDS virus is being spread through the country's medical system. 
</P>
<P>
Two other children, a 2-year-old girl and a year-old boy, also apparently 
contracted the virus through the use of contaminated equipment at a local 
children's hospital in Rostov, the paper said, and both are now seriously ill, 
suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old died, Izvestia said, after the loss of his natural immunity to 
disease weakened him and made him vulnerable to the heart problems he 
previously had been able to resist. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's death brought to five the number of Soviet citizens whose deaths have 
been officially attributed to AIDS-related diseases; three foreigners have also 
died here from AIDS, health officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
258 Carriers Registered 
</P>
<P>
Soviet health authorities said earlier this month that they had registered 258 
Soviet citizens as carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus, an increase of 
35% from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent the further spread of the disease through the country's medical 
system will require an immediate reorganization of health care, Alexander 
Kondrusev, a deputy health minister, told Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
"Sterilization at all stages of examination and treatment is the main way to 
halt the spread of the disease," Kondrusev said. "But not only should the rules 
for medical personnel be made stricter, the whole state of our clinics should 
be changed. This is a huge task, but it must be solved immediately at state 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the country's medical care system for slack standards and haphazard 
hygiene, Izvestia and other major Soviet newspapers have suggested that AIDS is 
now spreading faster through the nation's hospitals than through sexual 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet medical personnel, castigated almost daily now for jeopardizing the 
health of those entrusted to them, are complaining in return that they often 
lack sufficient equipment to sterilize syringes -- there is an extreme shortage 
of disposable syringes -- and other instruments after each use, and they cannot 
get the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
And officials at the Soviet wholesale firm that buys and distributes medical 
equipment told Izvestia that factories, many of them in the defense industry, 
are refusing to manufacture the sterilizers and other much-needed equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In Rostov, for example, a factory that manufactures machinery for nuclear power 
plants is working at only half of its capacity and could easily make the 
sterilizers that are in such short supply, local officials told Izvestia, but 
so far it has declined. Other Rostov factories, including defense plants, have 
similarly said they are not against retooling to produce the equipment, but 
none has moved to do so. Only newly formed cooperative enterprises are trying 
to meet the need. 
</P>
<P>
"We are counting kopecks and forgetting our health," Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there were enough autoclaves and other equipment to sterilize syringes 
and other medical instruments, the problem would remain, Izvestia said, because 
no precautions are being taken at most dental clinics, medical laboratories and 
some surgical units. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kondrusev said the route of the virus has not yet been fully traced, 
it may have been brought to Rostov when dozens of children from another city, 
Elista, were taken to a central hospitals in regional centers, including 
Rostov, for treatment of what proved to be AIDS-related diseases late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10 children were found last month to have contracted the AIDS virus 
from the Elista children in a Volgograd clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The children from Elista had themselves been infected, probably from 
unsterilized syringes, while receiving medical care, Soviet officials have 
said. At least 46 children and 10 adults were infected with the AIDS virus at 
the Elista hospital, according to earlier reports. 
</P>
<P>
A team of specialists, flown from Moscow, is now screening more than 300 other 
people, most of them children, who were treated at the Rostov children's 
hospital and two other local hospitals at that time, Izvestia said.

TURMOIL IN CHINA: CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT;

MITCHELL, OTHERS CRITICIZE BUSH FOR NOT LEADING CHINA CONDEMNATIONS

<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and others in Congress on 
Thursday strongly criticized President Bush for failing to forcefully condemn 
the execution of protesters in China. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he is upset by what he called Bush's "refusal" to express the 
revulsion the American people feel about recent events in China. He suggested 
that Bush is being a follower on the issue, allowing other world leaders to 
speak out. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States, as the leader of the world's democracies, as the symbol of 
freedom throughout the world, should be leading, not following, in this 
instance," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge the President to assume the proper role as spokesman for the American 
people, as leader of the Free World, and condemn these actions in the strongest 
possible terms and to convey directly to the Chinese leadership the disastrous 
consequences of the course which they are now pursuing." 
</P>
<P>
But the congressional criticism had no immediate impact on the President. In 
his first comment on the subject in two weeks, Bush told reporters: "China -- 
we're all very concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the President sees no need to 
say anything more at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe there's anyone in the world who doubts where the United 
States stands," he said. "We feel the Administration has spoken out loudly, 
strongly, without reservation on this issue -- forcefully, more than any other 
country in the world. . . . There's no need to repeat different words every day 
of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee that no additional actions against China are planned because U.S. 
policy toward Beijing must include matters beyond Chinese violations of human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Human rights has got to be a fundamental keystone and basis for American 
foreign policy, but there are also other considerations in the formation and 
implementation of American foreign policy that must be taken into account," 
Baker said. "And the geopolitical (and) economic relationship between the 
People's Republic of China and the United States is important. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people, both in the People's Republic of China and the United States, 
have worked for many years, 10 to 12, 15 years, to improve what had been a very 
poor relationship between these two countries, and significant progress had 
been made." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it appeared that congressional pressure on Bush to speak out more 
forcefully is only going to grow stronger in the days ahead. House Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) announced that the House leadership is 
drafting bipartisan legislation that would impose additional economic sanctions 
on China if the repression in that country continues. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, House members have proposed revoking most-favored-nation 
trading status for China and suspending subsidized loans to Chinese enterprises 
through the Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"Our government has taken a few limited, cautious, timid steps," said 
California Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) during a human rights task force 
hearing that he co-chaired with Rep. John Edward Porter (R-Ill.) "Rep. Porter 
and I feel we have to go beyond this." 
</P>
<P>
Lantos conceded that such sanctions might hurt the people of China as well as 
the government, but he added: "This Administration was not reluctant to impose 
economic sanctions on Nicaragua. . . . We should be willing to take similar 
actions against the People's Republic of China." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mitchell made no mention of additional sanctions. But he called 
on Bush "to condemn these actions personally and in the strongest possible 
terms, to give voice to the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the 
American people who are outraged and revolted by these executions." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said that members of Congress were disturbed when they met earlier 
this week with the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Han Xu, who 
indicated that he believes U.S. criticism of his country is coming primarily 
from Democrats and not from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to demonstrate the bipartisan nature of the U.S. position, the 
House passed a resolution 416 to 0 Thursday expressing support for the 
President's call for clemency for the Chinese demonstrators.

RUSHDIE SENTENCE STANDS, IRANIAN SAYS; 
</P>

RAFSANJANI INDICATES WEST WON'T GET POST-KHOMEINI OLIVE BRANCH

Iran's senior political leader declared here Thursday that the death sentence 
pronounced by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on author Salman Rushdie for 
his novel "Satanic Verses" cannot be changed. 
</P>
<P>
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, told a press 
conference at the conclusion of a visit here that the "prescription" against 
Rushdie on charges of blasphemy and apostasy cannot be annulled. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the sort of prescription that can be taken back," Rafsanjani said. 
"We cannot, in the name of God, take back that prescription. There is no one in 
Iran who would want to or could take back that prescription." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism Expected 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's uncompromising response seems certain -- like Khomeini's original 
condemnation -- to bring strong Western criticism of Tehran, and with it the 
new Iranian leader appeared to signal that Iran has no immediate intentions of 
repairing its relations with the West as it now has with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The West does not understand this question," Rafsanjani said, implicitly 
contrasting the outrage in the West with the broad official silence of the 
Soviet Union and most of its allies on the Rushdie affair. "What Iran said was 
according to the Sharia (Islamic law) . . . and not a personal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire Islamic world, in spite of some differences, is united in one voice 
in approving that prescription." 
</P>
<P>
Most Muslims consider the novel to be blasphemous and object particularly to 
its implication that the Koran is not the word of God but the creation of the 
prophet Mohammed. Rushdie, who was born to Muslim parents in Bombay, India, but 
now lives in Britain and no longer practices religion, is also accused of 
apostasy for forsaking and attacking Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, in a statement issued in February as Muslims around the world 
protested against the novel, declared: "The author of the book 'Satanic 
Verses,' which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, and all those 
involved in its publication who were aware of its content are sentenced to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Iranian clerics then offered a $5.2-million reward for Rushdie's execution, and 
he has been in hiding ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The sole candidate in the presidential election next month, Rafsanjani is 
widely expected to emerge as Iran's top political leader, and his press 
conference was one of his first opportunities since Khomeini's death June 3 to 
lay out his views in an international forum. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, asked about prospects for improved relations with the United 
States, chronicled Washington's past "offenses against the Iranian people" over 
the years, ending with the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which he described as the 
latest of the U.S. "plots and conspiracies" against Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"For all these reasons, the Americans saw their position (in Iran) damaged," he 
said, suggesting there would be no earlier improvement despite Khomeini's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praises Soviet Ties 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he praised the recent blossoming of the Soviet Union's relations 
with Iran after a decade marked by severe strains, and he said his talks here 
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have justified Tehran's hope for a further 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"New horizons are opening up," he said, speaking in Persian with his comments 
translated into Russian by an official interpreter. "We have almost reached all 
of our goals for this visit, and we have taken some major steps in expanding 
our bilateral ties." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a series of agreements on economic and technical cooperation 
that call for an expansion of trade and Soviet participation in Iran's 
development program over the next decade, the two countries issued a broad 
declaration Thursday pledging political and diplomatic cooperation and greater 
cultural and religious contacts. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union also declared its readiness to help Iran "strengthen its 
defense capacity," and Rafsanjani indicated that Tehran's preference was mostly 
for "technological assistance" that would build up the Iranian munitions 
industry so that it could produce its own aircraft, missiles and electronic 
equipment as well as artillery and armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow was the principal arms supplier to Iraq during the war with Iran, and 
its agreement to help rebuild the Iranian military marks an important shift in 
the alliances of the region. 
</P>
<P>
The welcome Rafsanjani received here was one that the Kremlin usually reserves 
for the most respected heads of state, and it was clearly meant to celebrate 
the dramatic improvement in Soviet-Iranian relations. 
</P>
<P>
He invited Gorbachev to pay a visit to Iran, and the Soviet leader, thanking 
him, said that Moscow looks forward to extensive contacts with Tehran at all 
levels as their relations develop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan War Discussed 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said he and Gorbachev discussed the continuing war in Afghanistan, 
which had been a major issue between the Soviet Union and Iran over the past 
decade. With the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country last February, he 
said, "it is now up to the Afghan people themselves to settle things. 
</P>
<P>
"We, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and China must as neighboring countries help 
the Afghan people to decide this Afghan problem," he added. Iran, he continued, 
is discussing the situation with the Muslim rebels, the moujahedeen, some of 
whom have been based in Iran, in the hope of promoting a political settlement.

LAWYERS CRITICAL OF RULINGS ON SEIZURE OF ATTORNEY FEES 
</P>

Leading criminal defense lawyers Thursday characterized as chilling the U.S. 
Supreme Court's decisions permitting the government to confiscate certain 
assets intended to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the decisions will discourage private attorneys from taking 
cases in which the government alleges that money intended or used to pay 
lawyers' fees was illegally obtained and therefore should be forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
They said also that the rulings represent a shift of too much power to federal 
prosecutors, who will have the right to obtain pretrial court orders permitting 
the government to seize such assets. They said it gives unscrupulous 
prosecutors an economic club strong enough to force skilled adversaries out of 
a case, thereby depriving defendants of their constitutional right to counsel 
of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defendants' Rights Cited 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction has to deal with rights of defendants," said Ephraim 
Margolin of San Francisco, president of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers, which has 18,000 members. "The Supreme Court by a margin of one simply 
felt that the right to counsel of choice can be done away with" under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
He said the two 5-4 decisions deprive "defendants in the most complex, 
difficult, expensive lawsuits of services of lawyers whom they trust, who have 
big reputations and experience." 
</P>
<P>
The decisions, which hold that no one has the constitutional right to spend 
illegally obtained funds for the services of an attorney, involved two drug 
cases in which narcotics proceeds had been used or were intended to be used to 
pay attorneys. But it could apply to profits from other kinds of illegal 
enterprises, including money laundering and insider stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that a defendant's assets may be frozen even before he is 
convicted if there is good reason to believe that the assets were illegally 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
"It presumes guilt," said Los Angeles defense attorney Howard Weitzman, best 
known for his successful defense of auto maker John Z. DeLorean in a 
drug-trafficking case. 
</P>
<P>
"It also gives the government an additional power in criminal prosecutions that 
they just should not have," Weitzman added. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman predicted, however, that the power will be judiciously used. "My 
prediction is that the good prosecutors -- and there are thousands of them in 
the federal government -- won't abuse this opportunity that the Supreme Court 
has unfortunately given them." 
</P>
<P>
He said there may be cases in which there is undisputed evidence -- such as 
from a wiretap -- that a lawyer knew that his fees came from illegal profits. 
But he said those would be rare. "In 25 years, I've never had a client tell me 
(of illegal profits)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar said that he expects another 
round of litigation aimed at defining under what circumstances a lawyer may 
reasonably be expected to know that his fees are coming from a client's illegal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamisar said, "The message to the lawyer is: 'Don't represent the 
defendant because you'll lose your fee.' 
</P>
<P>
"Big deal?" he asked rhetorically. "What's wrong with the public defender? The 
problem is these are complicated cases where astute, experienced lawyers are 
most needed . . . . The public defender or even court-appointed counsel simply 
can't do the thorough job of preparation that a really blue-ribbon lawyer can 
do . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You want the best lawyers to challenge the government, and presumably, if they 
succeed (in stretching or making new law), they will benefit all defendants. I 
guess I believe in that." 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said that "as a practical matter, it is too early to say what a given 
lawyer will do. But, when the first efforts to enforce the (forfeiture) law 
occurred . . . I was inundated with telephone calls . . . . One sticks in my 
mind from a small town in Ohio. The lawyer said, 'A guy wants to pay me $15,000 
to represent him on a marijuana case. Do I dare take it?' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chilling effect when a lawyer has to switch from thinking about 
defending the client to keeping himself from going under." 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said he turned down some complex, high-profile racketeering cases this 
month in expectation of the decision "for fear that my fees will be interrupted 
and my office will go under."

HIGH COURT NARROWS SCOPE OF ANOTHER CIVIL RIGHTS LAW 
</P>

The Supreme Court's conservative bloc narrowed the scope of another civil 
rights law Thursday, ruling that public employees who suffer racial bias may 
not win damages from a local government agency unless they can prove that its 
top officials had a "policy or custom" of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-4 ruling means that teachers, police officers or other city workers will 
not be able to win money from a school district, city or county simply because 
they suffered racial discrimination at the hands of a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The employees can win a damage suit against the individual supervisor, the 
court said, but they cannot win damages from the agency itself without proving 
that the top officials were to blame. Only if racial discrimination was a 
"standard operating procedure" for top policy-making officials can an employee 
win a damage verdict against the agency, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights lawyers said the ruling cuts back the prevailing interpretation of 
the 1866 Civil Rights Act, making it harder for public employees to gain 
redress for discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"They have done it again. This is another ruling that just makes it more 
difficult to get a remedy for discrimination," said Penda Hair, staff attorney 
for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Washington. In practical terms, there is 
often no reason to sue a discriminatory supervisor because a plaintiff, even if 
successful, will not be able to win much in damages, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for cities downplayed the ruling, saying it affects few cases and 
merely brings the 1866 law into line with other recent court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call this a surprise and I don't think it will have much practical 
significance," said Carter Phillips, a Washington lawyer who has represented 
local governments before the Supreme Court. "It seems to me that it makes sense 
to say that you are not going to impose liability on a city where there was no 
city policy that you are objecting to." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the high court said a city employee who was fired for exercising his 
free speech rights cannot win damages from the city itself without proving that 
a top city policy-maker was to blame for his dismissal. The ruling was based on 
the Civil Rights Act of 1871, known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which permits 
suits against people who violate another's constitutional rights. Since 1978, 
the court has defined a municipality as a "person" under this law. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling focused on the more narrow 1866 act, which forbids racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, applied the standard set in 
the 1871 law to the 1866 law. Since the two laws were "designed to punish only 
the official commiting a violation," not the government itself, most suits 
should be limited to individuals, she said. However, an employee can win a 
damage verdict against a local governmental agency if he or she can prove that 
its top officials had a policy, a custom, or a "longstanding practice" of 
treating employees in a discriminatory manner. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim of discrimination in the case was a Dallas high school's 
white football coach who was dismissed by a black principal. He was 
subsequently transferred to a lesser position at another school by the district 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The coach filed a racial discrimination suit and a jury awarded him $150,000 
against the principal and $650,000 against the school district. The principal, 
who settled with the former coach for an undisclosed sum, did not figure in the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Vacating the award against the school district, the justices sent the case back 
to Dallas for a new trial to determine if the school superintendent who 
approved the coach's transfer had a policy, custom, or practice of racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In an angry dissent, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. complained that the court 
was doing away with the 1866 law. Last week, the court said the law did not 
forbid all racial discrimination in the private sector, but only bias in the 
"making of contracts." This week, the court limited its use for public 
employees, he said, which "raises the possibility that this landmark 
civil-rights statute affords no civil redress at all." He was joined in dissent 
in the case (Jett vs. Dallas Independent School District, 87-2084) by Justices 
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.

An 18-year-old police horse fell through a pier into Boston Harbor Thursday and 
died despite frantic efforts to save the frightened animal with a huge crane 
and life preservers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One man even ventured into the water and held the horse's head afloat in a 
valiant but failed rescue attempt, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 10:30 a.m. when Officer Ed Cahill dismounted by 
Pier 1 to investigate a parking violation and tethered his horse, Fortret, out 
of the sun on the paved pier, police said. About five minutes later, Cahill 
said he saw the horse fall through the hot tar. 
</P>
<P>
"He (the horse) had apparently fallen through a hole that was not more than 3 
by 3 (feet)," said Dr. Mark Goldstein, executive director of the MetroPark 
zoos, who responded to police requests for a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
Mounted Boston police officers, Metropolitan District Commission police, Boston 
firefighters and an Animal Rescue League veterinarian joined in efforts to 
extricate the chestnut-colored horse, a 10-year veteran of the mounted patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got there, there were numbers of people in (the water) trying to help 
the horse. They had life preservers under the horse to try to keep him afloat," 
Goldstein said. He said one man had jumped into the water and was holding 
Fortret's head above the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Workers using a crane hoisted the animal out of the water. Onlookers gathered 
on the nearby Northern Avenue bridge cheered as Fortret was brought to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
But the horse had apparently broken his back and may have also broken several 
ribs, Goldstein said. The animal died as it was being treated for shock.

USING DIAMONDS, RESEARCHERS REPORT CONVERTING HYDROGEN INTO METAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fulfilling a decades-long dream of theoretical physicists, researchers will 
report today that they have converted hydrogen, the lightest of all the 
elements, into a metal by compacting it between two diamonds under a pressure 
millions of times higher than that of the Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
When it becomes a metal, hydrogen reflects light like a mirror and should be a 
high-temperature superconducter of electricity, although the researchers at the 
Carnegie Institution in Washington, have not been able to measure that 
capability yet, they said in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planets' Cores 
</P>
<P>
Physicists are extremely interested in the new finding because they believe 
that the cores of large gaseous planets such as Jupiter and Saturn are composed 
of metallic hydrogen, which explains their large magnetic fields. Demonstration 
of the existence of metallic hydrogen lends credence to that belief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very exciting development," said Caltech astrophysicist David 
Stevenson. "It means, of course, that hydrogen is the most common metal in the 
solar system." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers also believe that metallic hydrogen will shed new light on the 
recently discovered ceramic high-temperature superconductors and have 
speculated about other potential uses for metallic hydrogen. If it could be 
stabilized, it might become a fuel for conventional nuclear fusion experiments 
or a highly compact rocket fuel that would generate extraordinary thrust for 
its weight and volume. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet researchers, in the 1970s, erroneously claimed that they had converted 
hydrogen and other materials into metals under high pressures and stuck to the 
belief long after it was widely discredited. That incident is thought to have 
set Soviet high-pressure research back by at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The new discovery was made possible by the earlier development at Carnegie of 
diamond anvils for producing high pressures -- the concept of using diamonds 
had simply not occurred to researchers before. These anvils "have 
revolutionized the whole field of high-pressure physics," according to 
theoretical physicist Marvin Cohen of UC Berkeley. "It used to take a 
seven-story building to do what you can now do with a device that you can fit 
in your shirt pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond anvils are now used widely by other researchers to study a variety of 
materials under high pressures. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the Carnegie device are two small, 1/3-carat diamonds that have 
each been polished so that one side is nearly flat. A diamond is the only 
material strong enough to withstand the tremendous pressures exerted over a 
very small area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Process 
</P>
<P>
The sample to be studied is corraled between the two diamonds by a small hole 
in a stainless-steel plate between the diamonds. The diamonds are then forced 
together with a laboratory press. Because all the force of the press is focused 
on the very small area of the diamond, tremendously high pressures can be 
achieved -- up to 5 million times atmospheric pressure (5 megabars). 
</P>
<P>
The diamond anvil is also invaluable because the diamonds are transparent, 
allowing researchers to see what is happening to a sample inside the cell and 
to measure the optical properties of the sample. (Pressures are measured by 
observing the change in optical properties of a microscopic ruby placed inside 
the cell. 
</P>
<P>
Geophysicist Ho-Kwang Mao and physical chemist Russell J. Hemley of Carnegie 
confined a small amount of hydrogen gas in the cell, cooled it to minus 321 
degrees Fahrenheit and began applying pressure. 
</P>
<P>
At a pressure of about 64,000 atmospheres, the hydrogen becomes a transparent, 
crystalline solid that is an insulator; it does not conduct electricity. It 
remains in that form over a very wide range of pressures. 
</P>
<P>
But at a pressure of 1.5 megabars, the hydrogen undergoes a structural change 
and begins to absorb light, darkening visibly. At a pressure of 3 megabars, 
nearly the same pressure as at the center of the Earth, the hydrogen becomes 
"essentially an opaque solid," Hemley said in a telephone interview. Electronic 
evidence obtained by optical methods suggests that it should conduct 
electricity, but the sample's extremely small size precludes measuring it. 
</P>
<P>
Mao and Hemley observed the same metalization process with gaseous nitrogen, 
which became a metal at about 1.8 megabars, but observed no changes in some 
other materials, including sodium chloride (table salt), aluminum oxide and 
silicon dioxide. Theory predicts, however, that all materials will become 
metals if they are squeezed hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers have long believed that gaseous planets such as Jupiter have 
metallic hydrogen at their core, where the pressure is 20 to 50 megabars, 
because that is the only way to explain their magnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scientific Process' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody believed it would be true," said Caltech's Stevenson. "But still, 
you have to adhere to the scientific process and show that metallic hydrogen 
can be formed." One problem in the past, he said, was that such pressures could 
not be achieved in this type of experiment and that researchers did not know 
the pressure at which the transition to a metal occurred. "Now that we have 
this number, we can do more with it," in theoretical modeling of the large 
planets' interiors. 
</P>
<P>
Theory also predicts that metallic hydrogen should be a superconductor -- 
carrying electricity without any resistance. It will probably be impractical to 
make electronic devices out of metallic hydrogen, noted Cohen, but study of the 
material could help researchers find the mechanism by which recently discovered 
ceramic materials become superconducting, thereby leading to the discovery of 
even better superconductors. 
</P>
<P>
The search for metallic hydrogen has proved embarrassing to scientists at the 
Institute of High-Pressure Physics near Moscow. More than a decade ago, 
researchers there built a 50,000-ton press, which extended 84 feet above the 
ground and 45 feet below it, at least partially for the purpose of making 
metallic hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
The device used one diamond, which pressed against a metallic plate. The Soviet 
diamond, however, was pointed rather than flat like the Carnegie gem. Because 
Soviet researchers could not see through the cell, they measured electrical 
conductivity between the diamond and the flat plate. When a current passed 
between them, they assumed that the sample had become a metal. 
</P>
<P>
Over more than a decade, the Soviet researchers reported that they had 
converted hydrogen, rubies and a variety of other materials into metals. 
Subsequent studies showed, however, that the pointed diamond simply pierced the 
samples, making direct electrical contact with the metal plate.

SEIZURE OF DRUNK-DRIVING SUSPECTS' LICENSES APPROVED BY SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Senate approved legislation Thursday authorizing a peace officer to 
immediately seize the driver's license of a suspected drunk motorist pending a 
formal hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Without debate, the bill went to the Assembly on a 27-0 vote amid mounting 
concerns statewide that drastically increased penalties enacted for drunk 
driving over the past few years have failed to produce the major reductions in 
deaths and injuries that supporters had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, faces an uncertain future in the Assembly where the Public Safety 
Committee is considered a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer told the Senate that the experience of other states with speedy 
license-revocation laws has demonstrated that fatal accidents involving drunk 
drivers have been reduced about 10%. Twenty-three states have such laws. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer, who introduced the bill for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said that 
in California it often takes as long as 18 months from the time a drunk driver 
is arrested to when the offender's license is suspended or revoked by the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
He said his measure dealt only with the department's administrative action 
against the driver's license and would not affect separate criminal charges 
brought against the motorist. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would empower an arresting officer to seize the license of a 
drunk-driving suspect if the individual flunked a blood-alcohol test or refused 
to take the examination. Upon release from arrest and booking, the suspect 
would be issued a 30-day driving permit along with a notice of the license 
suspension. The driver could appeal to the DMV for return of the license. 
</P>
<P>
If the department rejected the appeal, the driver would be subject to a 
suspension of the license for six months on the first offense or for one year 
on a subsequent violation. The driver could appeal the department's action to 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
These administrative actions are apart from the criminal case being made 
against the driver. The department long has had the authority to suspend or 
revoke the driving privilege of motorists who fail the examination or refuse to 
take the blood-alcohol test. 
</P>
<P>
But Lockyer said many arrested drunk drivers now end-run the system and retain 
their licenses for long periods of time by claiming that they never received a 
notice of their license suspension from the DMV. He said such claims could not 
be pressed under his bill because at the same time the driver received the 
temporary permit, he or she would receive a copy of the suspension notice. 
</P>
<P>
The driver's license bill constituted part of a torrent of anti-crime and "get 
tougher" measures approved by the Senate on Thursday, many of which are likely 
to face problems in the Assembly Public Safety Committee, long known as a 
graveyard for popular as well as unpopular bills. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Lockyer told his colleagues that for Senate bills, the committee 
this session "will be as difficult as it has been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly firing a warning shot over the committee, he proposed that if the 
Assembly committee kills Senate crime bills, the Senate, in turn, amend into 
Assembly bills the contents of the defeated Senate measures and return them to 
the lower chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed bills passed by the Senate and sent to the Assembly included 
these: 
</P>
<P>
* A bill by Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) to make it a felony, punishable 
by three to nine years in prison, for the simultaneous possession of a firearm 
and illegal drugs. The vote was 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
* Legislation by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) reducing from 0.10% to 0.04% the 
blood-alcohol level at which a commercial driver is considered drunk. The bill, 
which would become effective July 1, 1990, would conform California law to 
federal law. The vote was 29-4. 
</P>
<P>
* A measure by Stirling that would increase the penalty for a ward of the 
California Youth Authority who beats up a guard to an additional two, three or 
four years. * A bill by Stirling to establish a military "basic training-type" 
program in the Youth Authority for certain "non-serious" and nonviolent 
offenders. The vote was 31 to 0.

The Eagle, the U.S. Coast Guard's three-masted training ship, sailed into 
Leningrad on Thursday, bringing 300 American sailors to the former imperial 
Russian capital on a good-will visit. The Eagle has a crew of 55 and 250 Coast 
Guard Academy cadets -- would-be officers learning their seamanship skills on 
an annual summer training cruise.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD DELAYS VOTE ON CLEAN AIR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Air Resources Board, after a daylong hearing in Los Angeles, delayed 
a vote on whether to approve a far-reaching plan by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District to bring the Los Angeles Basin into compliance with the 
federal Clean Air Act by the year 2007. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved last March by the AQMD board, but it must also be 
approved by the state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The ARB 
appeared poised to approve the plan, even though it acknowledged that some air 
pollution controls proposed may not be enforceable, which would violate the 
federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich repeated 
earlier criticisms that the plan is too costly and would eliminate thousands of 
jobs. But, David Howecamp, a top western regional official of the EPA, stressed 
the agency's "praise and firm support" for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing is scheduled to resume today in the State Building downtown at 107 
S. Broadway at 10 a.m. and a vote is expected at the hearing's conclusion.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEVELOPER GETS OK TO SCRAPE RIDGE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council will allow a developer to scrape off the top of a 
prominent ridge in order to fill in a hole and complete a controversial 
subdivision in the Verdugo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision this week gives Gregg-Gangi Development Co. permission 
to cut up to 70 feet from a ridge to obtain a quarter-million cubic yards of 
earth needed to complete the Oakmont View subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the developers would have had to truck in the dirt needed to fill 
the six-acre hole, which would have disrupted the quiet hillside neighborhood 
of expensive homes for at least 1 1/2 years, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that I have ever agonized over a decision as much as I have 
agonized over this one," said Councilman Larry Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said developers miscalculated how much dirt they needed to 
complete the 197-lot subdivision of exclusive view homes above the Oakmont 
Country Club. The project, approved in 1976, lacks about 25,000 truckloads of 
dirt needed to fill in an area for the final 25 lots, worth at least $5 
million.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUG CHARGE AGAINST ALLUMS DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance Superior Court judge dismissed a cocaine possession charge against 
former UCLA basketball star Darrell Allums Thursday and indicated he may 
consider reducing the nine-year sentence Allums received last week for eight 
armed holdups. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Hollingsworth Jr. ordered a report from prison authorities due 
Oct. 23 evaluating Allums' conduct in prison. Typically, when such a report is 
ordered by a judge, the result could be a reduced sentence or even release of 
the convict on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Allums, 30, was sentenced by Hollingsworth June 16 for robbing eight Domino's 
Pizza deliverymen using a screwdriver as a weapon. During that trial, the judge 
said he sympathized with Allums, who contended he commited the robberies to pay 
for his cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine possession charge was dismissed because it was "such a minor 
offense," Allums' lawyer Patrick Maginnis said. Allums had been caught with $25 
worth of rock cocaine in the spring of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, 1987, Allums was arrested on the robbery charges and has been in 
Los Angeles County Jail ever since. Maginnis said Allums has been a "model 
prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, he wielded a screwdriver and robbed people. I don't think 
nine years in prison is too harsh of a sentence," said Dist. Atty. Julie 
Sulman.

3 DIE, 1 CRITICALLY INJURED IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single-engine plane lost power and crashed Thursday in Santa Clarita, killing 
the pilot and two passengers and critically injuring a child on board. 
</P>
<P>
The child, a 13-year-old girl, was taken by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where she was in critical condition and 
breathing with the help of a respirator late Thursday afternoon, hospital 
spokeswoman Jane McCue said. The girl's name and the identities of the other 
victims, a man and two women, were withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Trinidad TB-21 four-seater en route from Sacramento to Van Nuys 
Airport, crashed at about 2:10 p.m. in rugged terrain west of Sierra Highway 
and south of Placerita Canyon Road, said Federal Aviation Administration 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the pilot appeared to have been trying to land on Sierra 
Highway, when the plane hit a high-voltage power line and plummeted to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes before the crash, the pilot had radioed the Van Nuys tower to 
report engine problems and ask for directions to the nearest airport, airport 
spokesman Bob Hayes said. The plane crashed moments after an air traffic 
controller gave directions and told the pilot to switch to a "Mayday" radio 
frequency, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot was operating under visual flight rules and was not being guided by 
ground controllers, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness John Stephens was taking pictures of a nearby auto accident and, 
after seeing the plane crash, went to check on the victims. Stephens said the 
pilot was a man who appeared to be in his 60s. The two women who died also 
appeared to be in their 60s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured girl lay on her back in the brush after apparently having been 
thrown several feet from the red-colored plane, Stephens and other eyewitnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no engine noise at all," said Jason Moore, 22, who saw the crash 
while working at a nearby construction site. "It was just gliding. It made a 
hard right turn . . . and then it clipped a wire and we heard it crash." 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like it didn't have any power," said Scott Fiscus, 26, another 
construction worker. "The pilot was coasting and trying to get his nose up. We 
saw it clip the wire and part of the plane flew off." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board 
remained at the crash scene late Thursday.

MOTEL OWNER CHARGED IN BID TO BRIBE BELL OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged a Bell motel owner 
Thursday with attempted bribery after she allegedly tried to pay a city 
councilman to approve plans for a second motel in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Chow (Michelle) Chang, 43, a Taiwanese immigrant who owns the 15-unit NuBell 
Motel on Florence Avenue with her husband, was being held at the Los Angeles 
County Sybil Brand Institute on $1-million bail, police officials said. 
Officials did not disclose the full name of Chang's husband. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's investigators arrested Chang in a parking lot at Florence 
and Wilcox avenues at 10 a.m. after they watched her allegedly pass a $2,000 
cash down payment to City Councilman George Cole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weeklong Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
The arrest ended a weeklong investigation of Chang. She first approached Cole 
last week and promised to pay him $15,000 if he voted to approve her motel plan 
and persuade two other councilmen to do the same, Bell-Cudahy Police Chief 
Manuel Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
"The message we want to get across is that the city of Bell is not a place that 
will tolerate corruption," Cole said at an afternoon press conference. "We want 
people to know that this is not the way we do business around here." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's plan to tear down two small homes on Florence Avenue and build a 
$2-million, 60-room motel was on the verge of being rejected. A month ago, the 
Bell Planning Commission had unanimously recommended that the council deny her 
application because there are more than a dozen motels within a mile of the 
proposed site near Florence and Atlantic avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those motels are homes to prostitutes who walk Florence Avenue, Ortega 
said. He declined to say if the NuBell has been identified by police in any 
recent prostitution arrests. 
</P>
<P>
But late last week, Cole said, Chang called him and asked if he would come to 
her house to discuss the application. The council, which was scheduled to hold 
a public hearing on her application last Monday, rarely approves a project that 
the Planning Commission finds unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that meeting the next day that Chang allegedly proposed the bribe 
scheme, Cole said. The scheme also included $10,000 payments to each councilman 
voting for the application. The application required the support of three 
councilmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contacted Officials 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that after his conversation with Chang he contacted Ortega and the 
district attorney's officials, who arranged to tape other telephone 
conversations and the sting operation Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The other council members were informed of the alleged bribery attempt before 
the council meeting. The scheduled hearing was then postponed, while Chang and 
her attorney sat in the audience, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bob Ewen, a district attorney's investigator who led the investigation, 
said Cole was carrying a listening device taped to his chest Thursday morning 
when he met Chang in the parking lot. Several officers sitting in a nearby car 
witnessed the conversation between Chang and Cole, Ewen said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's brother, who identified himself only as Chow, was working at the front 
desk of the small motel when he was told Thursday about his sister's arrest. "I 
didn't hear anything about this," he said. "I don't know her business, but she 
(would not) do this."

ACTIVIST SEEKS $1 MILLION IN LAPD RIGHTS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political activist Michael Zinzun filed a $1-million claim against the Los 
Angeles Police Department on Thursday, charging that information about him was 
illegally gathered and disbursed by police while he was running for office in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun said police and city officials covered up an investigation of the 
February incident, which ended with Police Chief Daryl F. Gates verbally 
reprimanding Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
The claim alleges that Zinzun's privacy, his civil rights and the terms of a 
previous court ruling barring police from spying on lawful citizens were 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prelude to Filing Suit 
</P>
<P>
The claim, which also names Gates and Vernon, is a prelude to filing a lawsuit. 
The city has 45 days to act after which a lawsuit can be filed under state law. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the claim, Gates insisted that Vernon did not take any sensitive 
information about Zinzun from police intelligence files. Rather, he said, the 
data came from a non-classified computer data base that consists mainly of 
electronic versions of newspaper and magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame Zinzun for not believing me because I would never believe 
anything Zinzun ever had to say," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that the computer terminal through which Vernon 
received the information has been moved from the anti-terrorist division and 
will be relocated in the office of Cmdr. William Booth, Gates' spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Vernon was rebuked by Gates after his use of the computer to 
gather data on Zinzun, a former Black Panther who in March waged his third 
unsuccessful campaign for Pasadena's Board of Directors. Zinzun blamed his 
defeat partially on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Data for Rivals 
</P>
<P>
Gates has said Vernon, a Pasadena resident, had printed out from the computer 
156 pages of data for Zinzun's political rivals. Gates said he intervened 
before Vernon could deliver the information. Department regulations prohibit 
personnel from using police resources for anything but official business. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun, a member of the Coalition Against Police Abuse, was a key figure in the 
1983 dismantling of the department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division, 
which had illegally spied and kept intelligence files on hundreds of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those files had been removed by a PDID detective who channeled the data 
to an ultra-right-wing group. In 1983, the city settled the suit for $1.8 
million, and the PDID was replaced by the Anti-Terrorist Division. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun and his attorney, Dan Stormer, said they believe the data Vernon 
requested included police intelligence not in the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council called for an investigation by the Police Commission, the 
department's civilian review board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handled in Executive Session 
</P>
<P>
Booth said the issue was handled by the commission in executive session "to the 
satisfaction of everyone involved," including the interested council members. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Councilman Robert Farrell, who originally called for the 
investigation, said the council had asked for a report but had not set a 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun a year ago agreed to a $1.2-million settlement with the Pasadena police 
over a 1986 incident at a housing complex in northwest Pasadena, which left him 
permanently blind in one eye.

JIM MURRAY: CITATION CAUGHT THE BRASS RING IN THE GOLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I guess the greatest horse race I will ever see was the San Juan Capistrano at 
Santa Anita between Noor and Citation in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who think Citation was the greatest race horse of our time and 
I could be one of them. But he never could beat Noor. 
</P>
<P>
Most horsemen thought it was a shame. Citation bent a hoof after winning the 
Triple Crown in '48 and was laid off a year. When he came back, they were 
afraid he wasn't quite himself so they took him out to California for some easy 
money. 
</P>
<P>
I was at Santa Anita the day he arrived, walking off the train at the siding 
there, and the trainer, Jimmy Jones, a round-faced little man who smiled a lot, 
was fussy about who came around him. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you really going to run him?" I wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Jones laughed. "We didn't come out here to put him in the Rose Parade," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they came out here to make him the first million-dollar horse. Big Cy 
had earned $865,150 at the point where he broke down and his owners, Calumet 
Farm, figured getting the rest from the Hollywood horses would be a lock. 
</P>
<P>
I learned a lot hanging around Jimmy and Citation that month. I learned that a 
sloppy track is the same as a fast track when Jones dropped Cy into a 
six-furlong race in a downpour that had washed out a Snead-Hogan golf playoff 
cross-town. I thought for his first race in over a year, a horse was owed a 
fast surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be fast," Jimmy predicted. 
</P>
<P>
It was. Cy ran it in 1:11. 
</P>
<P>
I learned that time didn't mean anything to a great horse. Jones told me the 
story: The stable had Coaltown, who could run through sound. Coaltown would 
blister six-furlongs in 1:08 2/5. Citation would run it in 1:10 4/5. Then they 
would hook up in a race and Citation would beat Coaltown by three lengths. In 
1:10 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Citation could do everything. He won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, took a 
little side trip over to the Jersey Derby, won that, then won the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
He beat older horses that year in the two-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup. He was so 
good, he ran in a Pimlico Special Stakes -- and not one horse contested it. 
Their trainers didn't want their horses' hearts broken. He had the race track 
to himself -- and still ran 1:59 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Then they put him in the Santa Anita Handicap and I remember standing in the 
paddock when this great black horse came into view. I whistled. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, he looks as if he could runover everything!" I allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't bet he won't," said Mrs. Connie Ring, the noted owner standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
And that was my introduction to Noor, a giant horse bred by the Aga Khan and 
owned by the sportsman car dealer, Charles S. Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Citation never could catch Noor. He gave away 22 pounds -- 132 to 110 -- in the 
Handicap that year but in the 1 3/4-mile Capistrano, they brought them closer 
together,Citation's 130 to Noor's 117. 
</P>
<P>
It was, to all intents and purposes, a match race. Race horses ordinarily are 
fainthearted creatures, but these two ran head and head for over a mile. Johnny 
Longden won the race. He took Noor to the outside and forced Steve Brooks, on 
Citation, to whip left-handed or not at all. Mostly, it was not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later in this race, there was a dead heat -- Fiddle Isle and 
Quicken Tree -- and to me, they were no closer than Citation and Noor. It was 
the gamest, gruelingest race I have ever seen a race horse run. 
</P>
<P>
It was sad. It was like Hogan missing a two-foot putt for an Open, Louis unable 
to get up at the bell, Ruth popping out, or Mays not able to get to a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
Citation didn't get his million that year in California, but I bring this up 
because this week at Hollywood Park, they're running the renewal of the race in 
which he finally went over the top, the Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The race is 50 years old this year and some of the greatest names in American 
turf history have run in it -- the great Seabiscuit, Swaps, Round Table, 
Gallant Man, Affirmed, Native Diver. None greater than Citation. 
</P>
<P>
The horses who are in it this year aren't Citations. They had a nice sort of a 
colt, Ruhlmann, given periodically to breaking clocks and track records, but 
he's out, leaving the spotlight to the kinds of horses who take turns beating 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
The race pays half a million nowadays but it paid $137,000 when Citation ran 
his last race here. 
</P>
<P>
They brought Citation up to the Gold Cup carefully that season -- a couple of 
sprints at Bay Meadows where he ran third both times at odds-on and then on to 
Hollywood Park where, after two losses, he came to form, winning the last three 
races of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He managed to sneak into the Gold Cup at 120 pounds. At 120 pounds, Citation 
could handle an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
He finally got his million -- the 100 grand put him at $1,085,760. It was a lot 
of money in 1951 and Citation was the first million-dollar horse. Today, they 
have $80,000 claiming races but Citation went out the way he came in -- with a 
visit to the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
The horse who wins the Gold Cup at Hollywood Sunday should be proud to stand on 
the same ground.

MORNING BRIEFING: SANDERS MAKES THEM COUNT BUT DOESN'T KNOW NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Finnigan of the Seattle Times wrote: "Deion Sanders is a two-sport marvel, 
drafted by the Yankees in baseball and Atlanta in the NFL, but he's also a 
natural no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
"He came into the Yankee camp this spring and asked for uniform No. 3 (Babe 
Ruth's), then No. 4 (Lou Gehrig's), then No. 5 (Joe DiMaggio's). He got No. 44 
(Reggie Jackson) and changed that for No. 18." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jackson when he got a look at Sanders with all his jewelry: "He had on his 
Mr. T starter set." 
</P>
<P>
Add Sanders: Asked whether he would rather hit a home run in baseball or return 
a punt for a touchdown in football, he opted for the punt return. 
</P>
<P>
"That counts for six points," he said. "The homer only counts for one." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: In a list of famous athletes who excelled in other sports, 
which ran on Page 12 in Thursday's editions, Jackie Robinson was short-changed, 
even though he headed the list. 
</P>
<P>
It was noted that he participated in track and football at UCLA, but left out 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, Robinson was a two-time scoring champion in the Pacific Coast 
Conference Southern Division. In 1939-40, he outscored USC All-American Ralph 
Vaughn to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Outside of the Big Ten, what conference has sent the most 
different schools out here for the Rose Bowl?

deleted from a beer promotion, the Chicago Sun-Times came up with this item:

'Produced by Caporal Tobacco Co. in 1909-11, the card was recalled when Wagner, 
who did not smoke, objected to the use of his picture in connection with a 
tobacco product.' " 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Quick now, who is the only member of the St. Louis 
Cardinals who has played in every game this year?

You got it, Pedro Guerrero.

Knee-deep! From Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel: "Months ago, top 
basketball officials were privately predicting Rick Pitino would make the jump 
from the Knicks back into college ball -- if not at Kentucky, then at some 
other big-time campus. Reason: Rick's ego, they say, was too large for the NBA, 
where the coach is not the big frog." 
</P>
<P>
That's exhaustion: Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson told the Louisville 
Courier-Journal he was convinced he would have to take a rest this season when 
he could not stop his hands from shaking violently when he raised them over his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson: "The first day home I slept 16 hours, the next day 12 and the next 
day 11. It wasn't because I was just physically tired, but because I was 
mentally exhausted. I could not have gone another day. Not one more day. I was 
extremely worn out."

Last season, the New York Yankees had three All-Stars -- Dave Winfield, Rickey 
Henderson and Don Mattingly. Now, with Winfield on the disabled list and 
Henderson having been traded to the Oakland A's, Mattingly is viewed as the 
team leader. 
</P>
<P>
He responded in proper fashion Thursday, two home runs -- for the second time 
in 11 days -- in the Yankees' 10-7 victory over the Chicago White Sox in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"That Mattingly is unbelievable," said Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg, a Yankee 
coach for seven seasons. "I used to like him." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly's three-run homer in the second inning gave New York a 4-0 lead. 
Then, after Jimmy Jones and new Yankee Greg Cadaret had squandered a 6-1 lead, 
Mattingly tied the score with a leadoff homer in the seventh off loser Shawn 
Hillegas (3-7). 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a high fastball and a slider in," Mattingly said. "I think the slider 
was what he wanted. I don't know about the fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly has 10 homers this season, all in Yankee Stadium. It was the 13th 
multiple-homer game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep trying to keep the ball down," joked Mattingly, who didn't hit his 
first homer of the year until May 24. "It seems we've done a little bit better 
since I've been swinging the bat better. Our offense seems to have come around 
a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Cadaret (1-0), was the beneficiary of Mattingly's power, gaining his first 
victory since last Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Cadaret was acquired from Oakland on Wednesday with Eric Plunk and Luis Polonia 
in the trade for Rickey Henderson. The three former A's took an overnight 
flight from California and got to New York early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Cadaret threw the ball pretty well for being in strange territory 
and getting here an hour before we were supposed to be dressed," Yankee Manager 
Dallas Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti relieved at the start of the eighth and finished for his 12th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Green, however, was unhappy with Jones, who allowed nine hits and five runs in 
4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The White Sox are not exactly a version of the '27 Yankees," Green said. "When 
you're a professional pitcher, especially when you have runs to work with, you 
should be able to get people out. That's elementary." 
</P>
<P>
After Mattingly tied the score, Mel Hall doubled with one out. Jesse Barfield 
then walked and, one out later, Tom Brookens, who had three hits, hit an RBI 
single. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Steve Lyons failed to handle center fielder Dave Gallagher's 
throw and the ball bounced into the dugout, allowing Barfield to score. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Phelps added a run-scoring single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
New York out-hit the White Sox, 15-13. Gallagher led Chicago with four hits. 
The Yankees' Steve Sax had three hits for the fourth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Cadaret replaced Jones with one out in the fifth after Daryl Boston's three run 
home run, his second of the game, pulled the White Sox to 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Cadaret gave up two runs in the seventh as Chicago went ahead, 7-6. Catcher Bob 
Geren threw away a bunt for an error, allowing the tying run to score, and Greg 
Walker followed with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago outfielder Ivan Calderon left the game in the fifth inning after 
reinjuring his chest and may have to be put on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Kansas City 2 -- Rob Deer's two-run homer tied the game in the 
ninth and Greg Brock's fielder's choice in the 10th scored the winning run as 
the Brewers rallied at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Deer hit his homer off Kansas City relief ace Steve Farr (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Farr had retired Brock to open the ninth, but Glenn Braggs doubled and Deer 
followed with his 17th homer. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I hit it pretty good but the way the wind was blowing in I just took 
off running," Deer said. "I saw (Willie) Wilson go back to the fence and saw 
him jump for it and I said, 'No, we've been out here too long.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Paul Molitor doubled to center with one out and Robin Yount was 
walked intentionally. When Gus Polidor singled to left to load the bases, the 
Royals put Bill Pecota into the lineup to give them a five-man infield. 
</P>
<P>
Brock then hit a grounder to Frank White. The second baseman got Polidor on the 
force at second despite bobbling the ball, but shortstop Brad Wellman's throw 
to first was not in time to get the sliding Brock as Molitor scored the winning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Crim (7-4), pitched the 10th inning, replacing Ted Higuera, who gave up 
six hits in nine innings. Higuera also struck out six and walked three.

ROOKIE GETS FIRST WIN AS REDS DEFEAT BRAVES, 6-1

On a day when things weren't going well for Pete Rose, Cincinnati rookie 
pitcher Scott Scudder made things better for his manager on the field when the 
Reds defeated the Braves, 6-1, Thursday at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid pitched a good ballgame," Rose said, whose Reds snapped a four-game 
losing streak when Scudder gained his first victory. "I would like to have seen 
him get a shutout, but once he lost the shutout, he'd given us enough." 
</P>
<P>
Scudder lost the shutout when he yielded three consecutive singles at the start 
of the eighth inning, but Rob Dibble retired the last six Braves in order, four 
on strikeouts, to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Scudder (1-1) allowed up seven hits and two walks, striking out five. He was 
recalled from the Reds' triple-A farm at Nashville earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds gave Scudder an early lead on a three-run homer by Barry Larkin and a 
two-run shot by Todd Benzinger. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for no offense was that kid pitched very well," Atlanta Manager 
Russ Nixon said. "He's a good looking pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Scudder was pleased with his first victory but still wanted more. "As a 
pitcher, you want a shutout and not just want a victory. However, this is more 
of a relief, than anything. Now I can relax." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati took a 3-0 lead in the third on Larkin's third homer of the season 
and first since April 17. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Quinones opened the inning with a single and went to second on Scudder's 
sacrifice. After Chris Sabo fouled out, Benzinger walked and Larkin followed 
with his homer over the left field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo started the fifth with a single and scored on Benzinger's seventh homer of 
the season, a drive over the center-field fence. The homer chased Atlanta's Tom 
Glavine (7-4), who gave up six hits in four-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati added a run in the sixth when Quinones doubled and scored on a 
single by Sabo.

Johnny Majors, Tennessee football coach, said that prize recruit Derric Evans 
will not be allowed to play for the Volunteers because of his arrest Tuesday 
night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and a high school teammate, Gary Edwards, were charged with two armed 
robberies at video stores. Evans was released Wednesday on $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Majors said that he would release Evans, a 6-foot-3, 195-pound safety, from his 
letter of intent if Evans asked. That would allow Evans to accept a scholarship 
at another school, but he would have to sit out a year and would lose a year of 
eligibility.

PACIFICARE HEALTH BIDS TO BUY WESTERN HEALTH ASSETS 
</P>

PacifiCare Health Systems, a health maintenance organization based in Cypress 
with more than 500,000 subscribers, said Thursday that it has made a friendly 
bid to acquire assets of troubled Western Health Plans of San Diego, which runs 
the 130,000-subscriber HMO called Greater San Diego Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, if consummated, would make PacifiCare the state's 
third-largest HMO after Kaiser Permanente, with 4 million members, and 
HealthNet, with about 700,000 members, said PacifiCare Chief Financial Officer 
Wayne Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare, which made the bid at Western's invitation, would not disclose the 
amount it offered to pay for the assets, which include Western's membership, 
provider contracts and contracts with employers. PacifiCare's subscriber base 
includes 360,000 members in Southern California; the balance are in Oregon, 
Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
The two parties will begin negotiating a definitive agreement today. 
</P>
<P>
Western is a publicly traded company whose stock is held mainly by 1,500 San 
Diego physicians who also provide services to the subscribers. Western Health 
Plans closed up 18 cents at 69 cents per share in American Stock Exchange 
trading while PacifiCare stock was unchanged in over-the-counter trading at 
$26.75. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deals Fall Through 
</P>
<P>
Similar to many other HMOs in the country, Western has suffered serious 
financial problems in recent years, resulting in several management 
reshufflings and scaling back of operations. With shareholder equity of 
negative $15.8 million as of March 31, Western has been looking for an investor 
or buyer for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Two other acquisition deals involving Western fell through in recent months, 
including a $21-million offer from a consortium of hospitals led by Sharp 
HealthCare and Scripps Memorial of San Diego, as well as a $15-million offer 
from Mercy Hospital of San Diego.

Home ownership is declining among young Americans but increasing among those 65 
and older, according to a Harvard University study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its annual report on the 
state of housing in the United States that the home ownership rate for those in 
the 25-34 age group was 45% in 1988, down from 52.3% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Among households headed by people 65 and older, however, the rate increased to 
75% in 1988 from 72.3% in 1980. The report said that many of those people 
already owned homes before housing costs increased in the 1970s and early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Young people, the study found, are increasingly unable to accumulate the down 
payment and other costs involved in buying a house.

GATT ORDERS U.S. TO CHANGE SUGAR QUOTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States got word Thursday that it must abandon its protective quotas 
on imports of foreign-grown sugar or make changes to bring them into line with 
international trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
The order came from the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
the 96-country compact that administers world trading rules. The GATT Council, 
the organization's top policy-making body, approved a lower-level finding that 
the quotas were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision will not necessarily mean the end of the U.S. sugar quotas, 
which have been criticized as one of the most egregious examples of U.S. 
protectionism. The order was based on relatively technical violations, which 
Washington believes that it can easily correct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Delay Action 
</P>
<P>
But the GATT Council also opened the way Thursday for initial consideration of 
a more sweeping complaint by the European Community that would challenge the 
application to raw sugar imports of a 1955 loophole that has allowed Washington 
to maintain quotas on farm products. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say it is likely that the White House will delay action on the 
ruling for at least several months. Policy-makers are considering several 
options, including converting the quotas to tariffs, which would then be legal 
under international rules. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has little stomach for continuing the sugar quotas. 
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills told an audience in Paris earlier this 
month that the sugar restrictions are "very difficult . . . and hard for me to 
defend." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Administration faces a vocal minority in Congress that wants 
to maintain the quotas. Because of the quota system, U.S. consumers pay twice 
the world price for sugar, with the benefits going mainly to makers of corn 
sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the quotas shut out imports from cash-strapped U.S. allies 
such as the Philippines, the Dominican Republic and much of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The quotas limit imports of foreign sugar to 1.25 million tons a year -- about 
7.6% of the total U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Violation Found 
</P>
<P>
The finding of the GATT Council -- based on a complaint filed by Australia -- 
had been widely expected. The Australians had charged that the quotas violated 
GATT rules requiring that U.S. producers be restricted as well, through 
imposition of domestic marketing controls. 
</P>
<P>
Hills pointed out in a formal statement Thursday that the GATT panel "did not 
find the sugar program to violate" GATT rules, but ruled only that "U.S. 
administration of the quota system is in contravention of the GATT." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the United States has "an obligation" to bring the quotas 
into line with international trading rules, she also noted that U.S. officials 
would have "ample time to consider our options," and would be "consulting 
closely with the industry and Congress."

Arthur Young and Ernst &amp; Whinney OK Merger: As expected, U.S. partners of 
both firms overwhelmingly approved their previously announced merger proposal 
that would create the world's largest accounting firm. The new firm, to be 
known as Ernst &amp; Young, is expected to commence operations by Oct. 1. While 
non-U.S. partners must still formally OK the combination, approval of the U.S. 
partners was sufficient to seal the combination, an Arthur Young spokesman 
said.

Guilty Plea in Investment Scheme: A Venice man pleaded guilty Thursday in 
federal court to bilking elderly investors out of more than $300,000 after the 
stock market crash in October, 1987. Assistant U.S. Atty. David A. Katz said 
John Ernest Giovanoli, 28, was soliciting investments in coins through a 
"boiler room" telephone-sales scheme. After the crash, he persuaded investors 
to send him their coins with a promise they would be sold at a profit in the 
frenzied market. But Katz said Giovanoli pocketed the money.

Mulheren Pleads Innocent: Former Wall Street trader John A. Mulheren Jr. 
pleaded innocent to charges that he assisted the securities fraud schemes of 
Ivan F. Boesky, the jailed stock speculator he is accused of plotting to kill. 
Mulheren, 39, of Rumson, N.J., was arraigned before a federal magistrate in 
Manhattan on a 42-count indictment handed down last week. Mulheren was charged 
with manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. common stock at Boesky's 
request and arranging a series of sham stock transactions to help Boesky 
companies evade taxes and circumvent securities laws. Gulf &amp; Western has 
since changed its name to Paramount Communications Inc. Last month, Mulheren 
pleaded innocent in New Jersey to state weapons possession charges in 
connection with an alleged plot on Boesky's life.

HANSON BIDS $4.8 BILLION FOR GOLD FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British industrial conglomerate Hanson PLC on Thursday announced a $4.8-billion 
bid for the battle-scarred British mining giant, Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, 
which just recently won a long battle to stay independent. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Gold quickly labeled the Hanson offer as inadequate. But analysts 
said they expect Hanson to win the mining concern eventually with a sweetened 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, with interests ranging from building materials to food retailing, said 
its offer amounted to a cash payment of $22.31 per share for all of 
Consolidated Gold's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
The move came a month after Consolidated Gold fended off the biggest takeover 
bid in British financial history, forcing South African-backed Minorco to 
abandon its $5.5-billion hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
The bid by Minorco -- Minerals and Resources Corp Ltd. -- which triggered a 
bitter nine-month takeover battle, was blocked in the U.S. courts under 
antitrust rulings. It would have created the West's biggest mining 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
That bid aroused fierce opposition from political groups that saw it as an 
effort by South Africa to expand its economic interests overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco, which wrested control of some 30% of Consolidated Gold shares in the 
course of the takeover battle, is the Luxembourg-based investment arm of South 
African businessman Harry Oppenheimer's gold and diamond empire. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's statement by Hanson sent shares in Consolidated Gold rocketing $3.13 
(2.02 pounds) to close at $22.55 (14.55 pounds) a share. 
</P>
<P>
It said Minorco had agreed to accept the offer for its share in Consolidated 
Gold stock. Hanson's chief, Lord Hanson, said in a statement: "This is a full 
and fair price which we are confident will be acceptable to the shareholders of 
Cons Gold." 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Gold said in a statement that the cash offer from Hanson was 
"substantially below" the Minorco bid. 
</P>
<P>
But there are indications that the bid will be settled in an amicable fashion 
once both sides have agreed upon a price. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Gold said its chairman, Rudolph Agnew, would be holding talks 
shortly with Hanson. It advised Consolidated Gold shareholders to take no 
action on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Consolidated Gold told Reuters that Lord Hanson and Sir 
Gordon White, chairman of Hanson's U.S. subsidiary, Hanson Industries, met 
Agnew on Wednesday night to tell him that Hanson would be announcing the bid.

HOUSE, IN REBUFF TO SENATE, REJECTS BREAKS FOR SOME FIRMS IN S&amp;L BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House, in a surprise move, voted Thursday to reject any attempts by the 
Senate to give special breaks to individual companies as part of the sweeping 
savings and loan rescue legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill includes carefully crafted amendments on behalf of Columbia 
Savings &amp; Loan, First Interstate, Sears, Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, 
Chemical Bank and other firms. Generally, these amendments provide relief for 
these firms from the rules and standards of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, House members had become convinced that the public would become angry 
over favored treatment for a handul of institutions in a bill that will become 
the biggest bailout in history, costing nearly $300 billion over 30 years. The 
taxpayers will shoulder about 70% of the financial burden to close hundreds of 
crippled S&amp;Ls and pay off their depositors, whose accounts are guaranteed 
by the federal government up to $100,000. The House stripped all 
special-interest provisions from its version of the S&amp;L bill, approved last 
week. But the Senate bill is replete with these amendments, and many could have 
been expected to survive in the House-Senate conference that will craft a final 
version to be sent to President Bush. On Thursday, the House by voice vote 
instructed its members at the conference to refuse to accept any 
special-interest provisions offered by the Senate. The instruction is a signal 
to the Senate that the House won't compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, by Rep. Chalmers Wylie (R-Ohio), ranking Republican on the House 
Banking Committee, enjoyed bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions benefiting specific firms are "superfluous baggage" that should 
be "dispensed with in this important legislation," said Rep. Henry Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.), Banking Committee chairman and leader of the conferees. 
</P>
<P>
House members working on the issue had been unable to get from the Senate a 
complete list of the special-interest provisions and the particular companies 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the conferees met formally for the first time on the 
S&amp;L bill, agreed the issue must be handled quickly and then adjourned until 
July 11. 
</P>
<P>
The conference won't meet formally because the Senate has two weeks of recess 
on its schedule, which could add as much as $500 million to the cost of the 
rescue package. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance fund is insolvent, lacking the cash needed to dispose of S&amp;Ls 
that continue to lose money. Private experts and members of Congress have 
estimated that the industry's losses are mounting by $1 billion a month. "The 
sense of urgency must be maintained," Gonzalez said. "I feel this is really a 
race against time." 
</P>
<P>
Other conferees from the House and Senate agreed, but no effort was made to 
change the Senate's previously scheduled recess. 
</P>
<P>
Until the conference resumes, staff members will discuss the easily compromised 
issues in the two massive bills and prepare documents for their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
The key issues in the conference, Gonzalez said, will be the capital standards, 
which govern the amount of cash that must be contributed to S&amp;Ls by their 
owners, and the handling of the legislation for federal budget purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill has the toughest capital standards, requiring that S&amp;L 
owners furnish $3 in cash for every $100 in loans made by the financial 
institution. Goodwill, the value of an institution beyond its financial and 
physical assets, may now be counted toward the 3% standard. But goodwill must 
be eliminated by 1995 and replaced by cash. The Senate bill, by contrast, 
allows S&amp;Ls to write off the value of goodwill over 25 years. The S&amp;L 
owners would be required to raise billions of dollars in cash to replace 
goodwill. Institutions unable to meet the standard would be restricted from 
growing and would come under close regulatory supervision. The S&amp;L industry 
fears that several hundred S&amp;Ls would disappear through sale or merger if 
they cannot comply with the strict standards in the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez predicted that lobbying from the industry would be "unremitting" in 
trying to persuade the conferees to adopt a standard less stringent than the 
House version.

PRIME COMPUTER DISCLOSES SECRET WHITE KNIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After months of searching, Prime Computer disclosed Thursday that it may 
finally have found a white knight buyer to rescue it from a hostile takeover 
bid by MAI Basic Four of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker said its board is reviewing an 
acquisition offer it received from a bidder that asked not to be identified. In 
a prepared statement, Prime said the terms of the offer prohibit the company at 
this point from disclosing the amount of the bid or the identity of the bidder. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, meanwhile, said it intends to raise its pending $1.1-billion offer for 
Prime, but the company would not say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the emergence of a rival bidder and MAI's willingness to boost 
its offer indicates that the seven-month takeover struggle is nearing a finale. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting close to the end of this one," said Robert M. Johnson, a 
technology analyst with the brokerage firm Rotan Mosle Inc. in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of a second bidder was not entirely unexpected. Prime recently 
said it was talking to several prospective buyers. It identified them only as 
two Fortune 500-size corporations and two firms specializing in debt-financed 
acquisitions known as leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
A Prime spokesman said he did not know when the company would disclose the 
identity of the bidder or details of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in Prime's stock was halted Thursday to give investors time to digest 
the new information. The company's stock closed unchanged at $15.875 per share 
in New York Stock Exchange trading.

<P>
The stock market rebounded from a three-session slide Thursday, encouraged by 
lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 21.47 points in the week's first 
three sessions, recovered 17.26 to 2,482.17. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.51 million shares, up from 
168.83 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were encouraged to see interest rates decline slightly in 
the government securities market despite a mixed dollar in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
But many Wall Streeters were still treading cautiously as they awaited 
indications of the Federal Reserve's next move in its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department revised its figure for growth of the gross national 
product in the first quarter to an annual rate of 4.4%, after adjustment for 
inflation. Previously the department had estimated it at 4.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said such a small adjustment didn't do much to stir the market out of 
its recent lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
On the market agenda for today are monthly reports on new orders for durable 
goods and personal income and spending for May. 
</P>
<P>
Newmont Mining climbed 5 1/4 to 40 1/8 and Hanson PLC gained 7/8 to 16 7/8. 
Hanson made a bid to take over Consolidated Gold Fields, which owns 49% of 
Newmont. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate closed down 5/8 at 64 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included McDonald's, up 1 1/8 at 29 3/8; General 
Electric, up 3/8 at 53 5/8; Philip Morris, up 1 3/4 at 138, and Eastman Kodak, 
up 1 at 48 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Integrated Resources common shares rose 5/8 to 4 5/8 and three of the company's 
preferred stocks ranked as the day's best percentage gainers among NYSE issues. 
</P>
<P>
Financier Robert M. Bass was reported to have talked with the troubled real 
estate and insurance concern about investing in it in exchange for a 
controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
Stride Rite gained 7/8 to 54 3/8, hitting a new 52-week high. Buying in the 
stock was ascribed both to takeover speculation and expectations of a strong 
quarterly earnings showing by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Trucks dropped 1/2 to 12 1/8 in the over-the-counter market. The company 
said it expects to post a loss for the second quarter and the first half of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,179.900, up 14.402. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks picked up 0.87 to 
180.05. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.87 to 368.43, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was up 1.84 at 322.32. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 1.47 to 
445.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 
362.21, up 1.14. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei index lost 20.31 points to close at 33,324.97. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices on London's Stock Exchange closed higher as Hanson PLC's surprise 
$4.8-billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields prompted strong gains in the 
mining and aggregate sectors of the market. The Financial Times 100-share index 
closed at 2,180.0, up 7.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
The latest government report on economic growth tipped bond prices higher in 
quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 1/4 point, or $2.50 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from price, slipped to 8.32% from 8.34% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices were lifted by the revise of the GNP. 
</P>
<P>
Though the growth rate was slightly higher than previously believed, much of it 
was due to a rebound from last summer's drought, a one-time boost that 
reflected the government's accounting methods and masked otherwise slow growth. 
Bond prices react positively to such news because it implies lower inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a slight positive, but overall the report was fairly neutral for the 
market," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices lost some ground in afternoon trading as the dollar weakened, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The market really didn't do a whole lot," said Elliott Platt, research 
director at DL&amp;J Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues edged up 1/16 point, intermediate maturities rose 1/8 point to 5/32 
point, and 20-year issues gained 1/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.625%, up from 9.375% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar sank against major foreign currencies in a slide deepened by a 
rumor, quickly denied by the White House, that President Bush had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar managed to recover some lost ground after the White House denial. 
Currency dealers said the rumor circulated in foreign exchange markets for 45 
minutes to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of buying interest in the dollar plus dollar sales by central banks 
to prop up the sagging British pound contributed to a generally weak day for 
the dollar, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
William Mikus, a vice president at Salomon Bros., said the Bush rumor "probably 
pushed the dollar through 140 yen, triggering a lot of stop-loss sales," which 
were aimed at limiting losses by unloading dollars in case the currency 
declined further.

<P>
Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at Bank of Boston's New York office, said 
trading was thin and choppy with the market on guard for possible central bank 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
A report by a Washington-based consulting group that Japan, the United States 
and West Germany were determined to bring the dollar lower by selling the 
American currency has been denied by central banks but has left traders extra 
wary, Morrissey said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices pulled back slightly in the United States after rising on markets 
abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $370.25 for an ounce 
of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, down $1 from Wednesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Reports of sugar purchases by the Soviet Union whipped the sugar futures market 
into a bullish frenzy, with prices reaching an 11-month high on speculation 
that the surprise transactions implied further buying down the road. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, corn and soybean futures wilted as rain arrived in Iowa; 
coffee futures rallied, and energy, precious metals and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures settled 0.50 cent to 0.94 cent higher on New York's Coffee, Sugar 
&amp; Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at $1.399 a pound, 
the market's highest level since July 25. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was fueled by trade reports that the Soviets had bought two cargoes 
of refined white sugar and one cargo of raw sugar on the open market. One cargo 
equals 10,000 to 12,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union usually does its sugar buying in the fall and winter and had 
stated repeatedly earlier this year that it had completed its sugar buying for 
all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the business view this as the tip of the proverbial 
iceberg, meaning the Soviets will come in and do even more shopping," said 
Arthur Stevenson, an analyst who follows the sugar, coffee and cocoa markets 
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that new Soviet purchases would total at least 100,000 
metric tons and could run as high as 300,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade as showers 
drenched some of the driest croplands in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Rainfall amounts varied widely in the western Corn Belt, but one report of a 
four-inch dousing in western Iowa apparently convinced traders that the 
severely dry conditions there were finally easing. 
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline futures climbed sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
following an Energy Department report that refuted Tuesday's American Petroleum 
Institute report showing a substantial rise in U.S. stocks of gasoline. The 
rally spilled over to the crude oil and heating oil markets. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 10 cents higher, with 
August at $19.30 a barrel; heating oil was 0.64 cent to 1.02 cents higher, with 
July at 48.62 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.56 cent to 1.89 cents 
higher, with July at 60.99 cents a gallon.

HOT TRENDS FOR COOL DAYS OF FALL 
</P>

<P>
If you want to add some vigor to your fall wardrobe, get a vest. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to wear the latest sartorial silhouette, try a three-button Ivy 
League sack suit. 
</P>
<P>
If you're shopping for the newest look in knits, sweaters in bold patterns are 
a smart pick. 
</P>
<P>
And expect to see lots of color mixed in with the earth tones you normally wear 
in the colder months. 
</P>
<P>
These were just some of the hot trends for fall/winter shown to some 175 
fashion editors at 45 runway presentations and events at the Men's Fashion 
Assn. press preview held here recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Luxurious fabrics in vivid colors is the big news for fall," says Chip 
Tolbert, MFA's fashion director. "I've never seen more truly beautiful and 
luxurious fabrics for men -- cashmeres, alpacas, velvets, fine corduroys and 
even rayon. They drape so well. Men can look elegant and feel comfortable at 
the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Among the new easy and elegant looks are Bill Robinson's textured ensembles -- 
mixes of corduroy, velvet, knit and silk in rich shades of claret, moss, plum, 
slate or spruce. His plum corduroy suit is worn with a rust velvet vest, mango 
corduroy shirt and silk striped Jacquard tie. 
</P>
<P>
And he suggests two new ways to accessorize suits and sport jackets. One is to 
mix a deep-tone shirt with a classic suit. Robinson sometimes shows the shirt 
buttoned to the throat without a tie. He also puts turtleneck sweaters under 
suits and jackets in the easy but elegant mode. 
</P>
<P>
Ronaldus Shamask opts for a more spare interpretation of elegance with solid 
separates in layers. An olive, double-breasted coat is worn over a buck suede 
blazer, white polo shirt, black cardigan sweater and gray wool pants. Shamask 
also shows the quintessential example of the new mood of casual elegance in 
menswear: a black-velvet, shawl-collar jacket worn with a dressy white shirt 
with attached floppy white bow at the neck, white vest and jeans -- a 
dressed-down dandy look for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Though simple knit turtlenecks are often shown under suits and sport jackets, 
pullover sweaters in bold patterns were the standout knits in most collections. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Forsythe, the new designer of the Perry Ellis menswear collections, adds 
an unexpected twist to the fall offerings with a group of tropical-pattern 
knits called "Typhoon Perry," including brightly colored parrot and palm-frond 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Grethel does an eye-catching oversize paisley pullover. Tony Lambert's 
knits come in bold "lollipop" shades of fuchsia, violet, lime and turquoise. 
And Bill Ditfort uses geometric motifs for his sweaters and sweater sets, as 
well as continuing with his best-selling Snoopy-motif cartoon sweaters. 
Marienbad's sweaters look like neo-folkloric collector's items with suede 
cutouts and serpentine appliques used in the company's collage knits. 
</P>
<P>
The vest, in fabric or knit, is easily the newest wardrobe accessory in both 
the sportswear and tailored clothing categories, with the sweater vest making a 
comeback in knitwear. Cecilia Metheny's oversize cardigan version, worn with 
dress shirt and trousers, makes a modern statement. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the brightest new stars at the press preview were Southern California 
resources: designer Karl Logan and a company called a.b.s. Men. 
</P>
<P>
Logan reinterprets "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" for the '90s with flannel 
ensembles in easy, full-cut silhouettes, such as a greatcoat worn over a Mao 
jacket and pull-on pants, or a gray flannel single-button jacket with matching 
shirt buttoned to the neck, worn with pleated pants. Logan also works his 
modern ensemble look in Donegal tweed. 
</P>
<P>
Designers Allen Bruce Schwartz and Kareen Johnson of the 1-year-old a.b.s. Men 
line describe their collection for fall/winter as "day into evening wear," an 
apt euphemism for the new dressy/casual mood prevalent in menswear. They dress 
up the new three-button jacket of the season by putting a tapestry vest 
underneath. A blanket plaid jacket is worn with a matching vest. 
</P>
<P>
And a double-breasted, houndstooth check suit has dressy details, such as a 
piped shawl collar to contrast with the casual, hidden-placket shirt worn 
buttoned to the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Other trendy odds and ends at the MFA press preview: the introduction of 
jewelry designer Robert Lee Morris' first collection of pendants, pins and 
belts for men, with "strong references to Celtic culture and myths," including 
crosses, keys and padlocks; the appearance of the youngest and oldest Olympic 
medal winners to help promote JC Penney's new U.S.A. Olympic apparel line (JC 
Penney will dress the athletes for the opening ceremonies at Barcelona in 
1992), and models dressed as Batman or in Batman-related sportswear and 
accessories in both the JC Penney show and the National Outerwear &amp; 
Sportswear Assn. show -- a way to add some "ZAP!," "BANG!" and "POW!" to the 
season.

A BIG SHIFT; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILERS FINALLY RECOGNIZE THAT LARGER-SIZE WOMEN ALSO HAVE STYLISH CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PADDY CALISTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask America's First Lady, Barbara Bush. Ask TV's first lady, Roseanne Barr. 
They're just two of the 33 million women in the United States who wear clothes 
larger than a Size 14 -- women who know the frustration of trying to find 
fashionable clothes that fit. These consumers have the dollars and desire to 
buy clothes. They just haven't had much choice. 
</P>
<P>
But stores are finally getting the idea. Based on the popularity of its 
large-size catalogue, For You, Spiegel opened a For You specialty shop in 
suburban Chicago 18 months ago, and last year combined retail/mail-order sales 
were $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
After success with an avant-garde large-size department in its Costa Mesa 
store, Bullock's opened Bullock's Woman, a stand-alone store in the Woodland 
Hills Promenade, featuring better-priced merchandise and prestigious labels. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Pirie Scott in Chicago did the same. I. Magnin has created upscale 
large-size departments and followed up with mail-order catalogues devoted to 
larger sizes. At Nordstrom stores in Southern California, large sizes are not 
confined to a special department. Instead, wherever they're available, they 
hang with the regular merchandise or can be ordered. 
</P>
<P>
All of this means that large-size women now have many of the same fashion 
choices available to them as do their "standard" size sisters. Pinafore 
jumpers; summery, full skirts with fitted jackets; Chanel-inspired looks, even 
shorts with gathered, "paper bag" waistlines once considered appropriate for 
only the trimmest figures, are available. 
</P>
<P>
If she wants to wear bright colors such as marigold, purple or orange, they're 
available to her now. And there are large-size clothes in floral-print 
patterns, many of them the same patterns used for Sizes 4 to 14 collections. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers now treat large-size customers like style-conscious consumers, 
instead of fat people in need of camouflage and extra yardage. The New 
York-based Forgotten Woman, the 20-store large- size boutique with a branch in 
Beverly Hills, was the first to recognize the need 10 years ago and began to 
special-order high- quality, better-priced goods. But it took almost a decade 
for department and specialty stores to follow the lead. 
</P>
<P>
After giving only lip service and unappealing clothes to large women, retailers 
have recognized that fashion can no longer be limited to Sizes 2 to 14, the 
sizes most often offered by manufacturers. Because the average American woman, 
at 5 feet, 3 inches and 138 pounds, wears a Size 12, store merchandisers have 
realized that there are big dollars to be made in double-digit sizes. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, more retailers are demanding big clothes from firms known for 
their contemporary style. 
</P>
<P>
This month, New York designer Adrienne Vittadini ships her first collection for 
ample silhouettes. In September, Liz Claiborne launches Elizabeth, dresses 
styled to fit big women. Designers such as Givenchy, Kay Unger for St. Gillian, 
Adrien Papell, Nancy Heller, Gene Ewing for Bis, and Eletra Casadei have all 
found ways to dress the woman sized 14 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line itself is convincing. Wardrobing large-size customers in the 
United States is an $8-billion business, says Christina Gruber, editor of Plus 
Sizes magazine, a retailers' trade journal. "That includes everything from 
sportswear and evening clothes to underwear and panty hose," she explains. 
Today, even jewelry manufacturers have scaled their designs to fit the fuller 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
"Until very recently the perception was that all large-size customers were the 
same -- that they all want the same look," explains Jeannie Slusher, who 
devoted her master's thesis at San Francisco State University to the problems 
and opportunities of dressing big women. While the stereotype has always been 
that the large customer is older, doesn't spend money on clothes and doesn't 
want to be noticed, "my research shows that the average customer is 25 to 34 
years old, she feels sexy, accepts her body the way it is and has as much money 
to spend on clothes as other women her age," says Slusher, who studied a group 
of 140 Northern California women who shop in stores that specialize in large 
sizes. 
</P>
<P>
In response, firms such as Melrose, Cherokee and Wild Rose have begun producing 
clothes that are very similar to the styles they produce for the Size 4 to 14 
customer. Both Speer and Cherokee president Jay Kester report that growth in 
large-size sales is far ahead of their regular divisions. "Cherokee women's 
division is 40% ahead of any other and is outselling the petite division by 
60%," Kester says. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that one of the best-selling items in the summer collection is a pair 
of all-cotton shorts. "Large women aren't afraid to wear shorts and short 
sleeves anymore. They are starving for fashion. That's why the business is on 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
Role models such as Mrs. Bush, Barr and Oprah Winfrey, before her 67-pound 
weight loss, have helped well-endowed women make some demands on retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing other large-size women as successes has given large women a new 
attitude," says Hara Marano, an editor and publisher who specializes in 
large-size fashion. "Roseanne is a character, for instance, for whom fashion 
isnot a priority, but she's likable, she's a mom, she works, she's sexy. She 
handles things. She shows us that a large woman can be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Marano encourages women who aren't finding clothes in their sizes to complain 
to store managers. 
</P>
<P>
"When something doesn't fit, she crawls out of the fitting room feeling 
depressed. But it's not her fault. There should be clothes sized to fit the 
majority of American women," Marano says. 
</P>
<P>
Slusher is encouraged by the increase in attention to large-size women by 
manufacturers and retailers. And, she says, it can only get better. "By the 
year 2000, one in eight people will be over 60. If we accept that aging also 
means getting heavier, a lot of women who now are Size 12 or 14 will jump into 
larger sizes." 
</P>
<P>
And that means the major growth of the large-size industry as a fashion 
business is only in its formative stages. When designers known for their 
close-to-the-body fit, such as Yves Saint Laurent, Donna Karan and Azzedine 
Alaia, get the big idea, the battle of fashion versus the bulge will be over.

FOR BETTER OR WORSE, MANY RETIREES SAY BYE, BYE, MISS AMERICAN PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LARSEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1981 and, in San Jose, Tom Curran was hearing rumors that the 
savings and loan service department in which he worked was about to be 
transferred to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"After having lived there three years, and now being happily settled in San 
Jose for 14 years, I was age 49 and I dreaded the thought of having to face 
that rat race in Southern California again," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
So Curran, divorced, took a somewhat unusual tour to the Central American 
country of Costa Rica. It was led by Modesto-based Retirement Explorations, 
which periodically escorts groups of Americans on personal-evaluation tours of 
foreign countries popular as retirement havens. "I liked what I saw in Costa 
Rica, and I spent $12,500 to buy a lot on a hill overlooking another San Jose 
-- the capital city," Curran said. "For another $24,000, I built a 
three-bedroom house on it. 
</P>
<P>
"By then, the department's move in California had been officially announced. I 
submitted my resignation and cashed out everything I owned -- two pieces of 
property, furniture, car. I added the money from this to my severance pay, and 
put everything into a savings account." 
</P>
<P>
Curran said he gets by easily in Costa Rica on $600 a month, which covers his 
comprehensive health-care plan, automobile insurance, twice-weekly maid 
service, frequent restaurant meals, cable television service supplying most 
stateside stations, and trips to the United States to visit his daughter and 
son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Heading Abroad 
</P>
<P>
Expatriating. It is a decision being reached by a lot of Americans at or near 
retirement age: Instead of settling for a reduced standard of living -- 
sometimes substantially so -- on diminished retirement incomes in the United 
States, they head abroad; in many cases to a life more luxurious than the one 
they had when they worked for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Every silver lining, however, has its cloud. Authorities and experienced 
retirees mention such potential negatives as culture shock over everything from 
the local cuisine to driving habits to the lack of American products, 
loneliness (which may be only partially alleviated by moving to the "Gringo 
Gulch" section of one's adopted country), security problems (barred windows 
aren't uncommon in some parts of Costa Rica, for example) and political 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
There also may be the necessity of learning a foreign language, 
property-ownership problems (some countries don't allow outsiders to hold title 
or leave property to their heirs), being many miles and expensive airline 
flights away from family and friends, and below-customary standards for such 
services as mail, telephones and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Advises John Howells, author of the book "Choose Latin America": "Expect the 
unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
"There are many reasons why retired Americans are relocating aboard," said 
Shirley Waldrum, senior program specialist with the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons, the omnipresent group that claims more than 30 million members. "Not 
the least of the reasons is the fact that in most of the more popular places, 
the pace of living is slower than what they have been used to, particularly if 
the newcomers had been living in an urban area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opting for Earlier Retirement 
</P>
<P>
Peter A. Dickinson, author of "Travel and Retirement Edens Abroad," said from 
his home in Prescott, Ariz., that the trend to retirement abroad appears to 
have begun in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Around that time, people began more and more to choose early retirement," he 
said. "Having education, energy, and the desire to travel, they found they 
might be more able to do so from a permanent foreign location, where lower 
living expenses might permit room in the budget for seeing other places. 
</P>
<P>
"As people began feeling comfortable about living in other nations," Dickinson 
added, "the word spread." 
</P>
<P>
How many Americans have uprooted? Philip Covington, public affairs officer with 
the Consular Affairs Bureau in Washington, D. C., said an estimated 2 million 
U. S. citizens are living overseas, a figure that doesn't include U. S. 
government workers, either military or non-military. 
</P>
<P>
"As for how many of that total are retirees, we have no way of knowing," he 
said. "But I would be surprised if the number isn't at least half a million." 
</P>
<P>
Although no agency or organization specifically tracks numbers of older 
Americans living abroad, there are some clues: 
</P>
<P>
* According to Frank Battistelli of the Social Security Administration, 163,649 
Social Security retirement checks are being sent monthly to former American 
workers in foreign nations. As of April, the top 10 foreign countries for 
Americans receiving retirement Social Security checks were Canada (32,094), 
Mexico (20,072), Italy (19,520), West Germany (10,108), Greece (7,333), the 
Philippines (6,690), Portugal (4,516), Ireland (3,698), Israel (3,000) and 
Spain (2,917) -- figures up slightly from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
* However, according to Marty Scutt, a retirement travel consultant, probably 
at least that many people are having their checks deposited in banks in the 
United States while living abroad, and simply draw on them. 
</P>
<P>
* To that total, of course, must be added those seniors in other lands who 
haven't yet reached age 62, the earliest at which a Social Security retirement 
check is issued. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said that in some cases the above figures represent numbers of older 
Americans who have decided to return to their roots. 
</P>
<P>
"With many others, however, the moves reflect a sense of adventure, especially 
now that they have the time and usually the money to expand their horizons," 
Dickinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Canada -- the country requiring perhaps the least dislocation of American 
sensibilities -- is (judging from the number of Social Security recipients) the 
most popular foreign relocation destination. Among the reasons, Dickinson 
noted, are being nearer home, benefiting from relatively low energy costs, 
being eligible for an excellent national health system, living somewhat less 
expensively because of the favorable exchange rate, and living pretty much an 
American life style. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why They Move 
</P>
<P>
Jane Parker, who started Retirement Explorations about 11 years ago, said her 
tour group has just completed a survey of American retirees in Spain, Portugal 
and Costa Rica. She said the reasons they gave for making the moves were, in 
order of importance: 
</P>
<P>
* Living in a peaceful and relaxed environment. 
</P>
<P>
* Living inexpensively. 
</P>
<P>
* Being in comfortable weather (Scutt noted that in many of the more favored 
places -- such as Portugal, Spain and Costa Rica -- a fireplace will do for 
heat, an overhead fan for air conditioning). 
</P>
<P>
* Having access to good medical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the coin, when the several hundred American retirees 
surveyed were asked why they had chosen to leave the United States, Parker said 
they gave reasons such as the increase in crime and in drug usage, traffic 
congestion, medical costs -- "and the general attitude of young people toward 
their elders. In their new nations, the retirees like the idea of finding older 
people treated with respect." 
</P>
<P>
However, roses do have thorns. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Leining and his wife, Joel, both 67 and living in Los Angeles, had 
heard a lot about Mexico's San Miguel de Allende, also known as Carmel South, a 
cultural vortex for expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
"In November of last year, we went down to see for ourselves," he said. "We 
liked what we saw and heard. We found a new apartment building that was being 
constructed, and the owner said he would rent us one of the apartments, fully 
furnished, for $300 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up our apartment in Los Angeles, and put our furniture in storage. My 
wife had to go to the Northwest on an extended business trip, but, at the end 
of February, I went down with the intention of getting everything set up so 
that we could both settle down there permanently." 
</P>
<P>
Leining, a former university administrator (at USC and the University of 
Redlands), said the accommodations were first- rate -- "the apartment had a 
beamed ceiling, and outside was a lime tree I just had to shake to get as many 
as I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The newcomer said that, in order to assimilate while awaiting the arrival of 
his wife, he plunged into activities: 
</P>
<P>
"Five days a week, I taught a 90-minute English class for Mexican children at 
the local school, on Tuesday afternoons I played cribbage with other 
expatriates, on Wednesday afternoons I went to the Rotary Club meetings, for 
three hours on Friday afternoons I taught English to the prisoners at the jail. 
I joined a church, I went to art shows, I wrote a column on aging for the 
English-language newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he recalled, he found himself with a nebulous sense of loneliness: "I 
was around people, but I somehow felt lonesome, and it wasn't just because of 
the absence of my wife. Eventually, I felt that even when she arrived, we would 
never really fit in. 
</P>
<P>
"I found there were other expatriates with the same feeling. They sat around 
all day and just brooded." 
</P>
<P>
Leining said he began increasingly hearing complaints of how much more 
expensive everything is in San Miguel de Allende than it used to be. "A little 
5-ounce can of shaving cream, for instance, costs $6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Loved the Life 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I came across many expatriates who had lived there 10 to 20 years, 
and loved it. Some said they had left their native lands because they had 
become disillusioned. In effect, they were saying the hell with everything." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, however, Leining made a decision, called up his wife, and 
said, "Let's go back to L.A.": "I don't mean to put down Mexico, but it just 
wouldn't have been for us. My wife agreed." 
</P>
<P>
Leining is staying in Los Angeles with his daughter, his wife is due in town 
soon, and they plan to resume their retirement in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As most retirees know before they go, or quickly find out, Social Security 
checks will keep coming no matter how long you stay outside the United States 
-- except if you are in Albania, Cuba, Kampuchea (formerly Cambodia), East 
Berlin, East Germany, North Korea or Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare, on the other hand, usually doesn't follow the retiree. It may cover 
in emergency situations in Mexico and Canada, a spokesman for the program 
noted, but otherwise not if one is living elsewhere abroad. 
</P>
<P>
And regardless of the country, the American abroad must continue to file U. S. 
income tax returns, according to Internal Revenue Service public affairs 
specialist Shirley Nakagawa. This may be in addition to filing a tax return in 
the new country -- although for some or all of this liability one may receive a 
credit against U. S. income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities on retirement abroad recommend renting, certainly at the beginning, 
and possibly indefinitely. "If you buy property, and your new country starts 
having economic or political problems," Dickinson said, "you may have trouble 
getting your money out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limits on Property 
</P>
<P>
And some nations put limits on real property transactions by foreigners. Fred 
Andresen, president of the Harbor Group Ltd., a real estate marketing firm in 
Corona del Mar that specializes in luxury foreign properties, mentioned 
Switzerland -- an expensive but desirable retirement haven. 
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal for non-Swiss to purchase property unless such a transaction had 
been authorized in advance by the canton (Swiss state). And if a foreigner does 
get permission to purchase, there can be no sale of it to another foreigner 
until the property has been owned for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"However, a home in Switzerland, once permitted, is well worth the effort." 
</P>
<P>
If the destination that the retiree has in mind does permit ownership, Andresen 
said, that person shouldn't sign anything before getting trustworthy local 
advice, such as from an attorney or real estate specialist. And tour-group 
founder Parker pointed out that the best bet is to pay cash and forget about 
trying for a mortgage, which can be difficult or impossible. 
</P>
<P>
As for willing any foreign property to heirs, a matter obviously of importance 
to retirees, Andresen recommended checking in advance with the consulate or 
with a tax lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
If you are headed abroad with the intention of finding work locally, forget it 
(unless you have sought-after skills). Many places aren't at all interested in 
your permanent presence if you may become a burden on their economies. 
</P>
<P>
"Most countries you might be interested in have strict regulations on outsiders 
working, unless your field is something like dentistry or electronics 
engineering," Howells said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Spain, for instance, it is very difficult for a foreigner to be allowed to 
hold a local job. In Costa Rica, you are allowed to stay if you apply for and 
obtain Pensionado status, by proving you will have a steady income from a 
private pension plan, investment income and Social Security." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spain a Magnet 
</P>
<P>
Like Costa Rica, Spain's relatively cheap living is becoming a magnet for many. 
The majority of Americans live in the Costa del Sol facing the Mediterranean, 
where Dickinson said he hears that a couple can live well on $1,400 a month. 
Howells quoted one expatriate: "Come on over and enjoy your retirement, but 
when you see medical problems coming, go home!" 
</P>
<P>
As Howells relates in "Choose Mexico," a book he co-authored with Don Merwin: 
"$400 a month, judiciously spent, will provide a couple with comfortable and 
attractive housing, meals out when you like, possibly a part-time servant, and 
a reasonable amount of travel." Inflation in terms of the peso has been high, 
Howells said, but if retirees have kept their funds in the United States, the 
currency exchange rate has allowed their buying power to remain relatively 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
Another pensioners' paradise reportedly is Portugal. Particularly popular is 
the Algarve region along the southern coast. "Compared with other European 
countries, including Spain, Portugal has always been relatively inexpensive," 
Dickinson said. Parker said she and her husband, Joe, have purchased a fully 
furnished house overlooking the Atlantic there for $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Argentina, which attracts American retirees, was rocked by 
food rioting last month in the wake of skyrocketing inflation. The political 
climate in Costa Rica has been stable so far, but there is no hiding the fact 
that its neighbors are Nicaragua and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
For many retirees, however, the advantages outweigh any potential perils. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth," 76-year-old Walter Vela said from Montevideo, "is that my pension 
would be insufficient in the United States for my wife and I to maintain an 
acceptable standard of living such as we enjoy in Uruguay." 
</P>
<P>
Vela, a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Swarthmore College, had been a Latin 
American economist for General Motors, advising GM on sales and plant 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
"They treated me well, but as regards the pension, you mustn't confuse General 
Motors with Generous Motors," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amount Needed for Housing 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, he and his wife, Betty, 56, decided to make Montevideo their permanent 
retirement headquarters. "It takes from $1,500 to $2,500 a month for an 
American couple to live," Walter Vela noted. "A large house sells for from 
$110,000 to $300,000, a good condo goes from $80,000 to $150,000. For rentals, 
a two-bedroom apartment is from $600 to $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
Vela said gasoline is expensive -- about $2.50 a gallon -- but because of 
excellent public transportation, a car isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Health care is superb," he said. "There are well-qualified physicians, and 
excellent hospitals, which charge around $100 a day for a semi-private room." 
</P>
<P>
As author Howells points out: "The nation's literacy rate is an incredible 97%. 
Education is both free and compulsory." 
</P>
<P>
Vela, who has lived in various communities both in the United States, South 
America and Europe, said the towns in Uruguay are the most crime-free he has 
ever known. In the resort of Punta del Este, he said, "my wife and I can go for 
a walk in the woods at night without any worries." 
</P>
<P>
And in that community, Howells writes: "A dinner is an elegant restaurant will 
cost $3, and a taxi ride just about anywhere in town $1.50." 
</P>
<P>
The only significant drawback for him and his wife, Vela said, is that it is 
rather a long flight to see their daughter in Connecticut and son in Florida. 
And since English isn't commonly spoken, Vela strongly recommended learning 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have never considered retirement in the United States," Vela said. 
"Life is too good here." 
</P>
<P>
From Costa Rica, Curran echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
The interest his savings account generates, "plus a small pension I began 
receiving from my former employer when I reached 55, provides more than I need 
to live on." 
</P>
<P>
What does he do with his time? "As little as possible," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"During a day I may work in my garden a little. I have orange and banana trees, 
and vegetables. Occasionally I go on drives around the countryside. I sometimes 
speak before groups of visiting Americans who are considering making the move. 
I watch TV and read, both in English and in Spanish. My two German shepherds 
keep me company. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of everything is ridiculously low. My maid works here for five hours 
a day, two days a week, and charges $3 each visit. Lettuce costs 5 cents a 
head. A meal in a first-class restaurant runs about $5. A first-run American 
movie is $1.50. Government-run health insurance is $20 a month. Cable 
television service is $10 a month."

BRINGING A MINORITY FOCUS TO UNITED WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the new chairman of United Way, Dr. Herbert L. Carter hopes the 70-year-old 
organization, which raised $88 million last year, will cease to be so reliant 
on corporate philanthropy and instead find ways for ethnic minorities who 
collectively constitute a majority to make contributions. "After all, it is 
their agency, too," Carter says. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 56, executive vice chancellor of the California State University 
system, this month became the first minority volunteer and the first public 
sector executive to chair United Way. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday he will be honored by United Way's three major ethnic volunteer 
councils -- the Black Partnership Development Council (which Carter organized), 
the Asian Pacific Research and Development Council and the Hispanic Volunteer 
Council -- at a salute at the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The corollary to minority population growth in Los Angeles, Carter says, is to 
involve minorities in the process of deciding how community priorities should 
be addressed in terms of dollars allocated and in a manner reflecting reality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directing Allocations 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says, there are "no United Way agencies that are exclusively 
concentrating on AIDS." He also hopes to use his position to focus allocations 
toward the homeless, substance abuse, child care, gang violence, illiteracy, 
teen-age pregnancy and parenting skills. 
</P>
<P>
He strongly wants to fight illiteracy. "One of six people in Los Angeles is 
functionally illiterate in terms of English. I think multilingualism should be 
applauded, but it is essential that people be able to read, write and converse 
in English if they are going to make it through the educational process." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Carter: "As the makeup of this community changes, we have to do everything 
we can to see that the leadership potential of the individual in these diverse 
minority groups is given a chance to flourish. . . . If not, we will have a 
paternalistic society in which the white minority is responsible for providing 
leadership to address the needs of the majority of minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Says Carter: "In Los Angeles we probably raise more than any other place in the 
world (for charity). But, if we look at the level of giving compared with 
per-capita giving in other cities, Los Angeles should be raising $200 million a 
year for United Way -- easy." What he observes, however, is "a highly segmented 
community" in which the entertainment and movie industries, churches, social 
groups and communities such as the Chinese that help themselves work 
independently. "While that is good, how do you broaden community 
responsibility, how do you function as an entity?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Native 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who golfs every weekend, gardens, reads spy thrillers and has a 
doctorate in public administration from USC, grew up in Little Rock, Ark. His 
father worked for Navy ordnance; his mother was a housekeeper and cook. He 
graduated in 1956 from Arkansas Agriculture, Mechanical and Normal College (now 
the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). "My parents were not educated 
people, but they were good people; they gave me a set of values that have 
served me well," Carter says. 
</P>
<P>
After his first job in Los Angeles at the post office, Carter worked with 
juvenile delinquents and eventually became executive director of the Los 
Angeles County Commission on Human Relations. In 1973, he ran for Mayor Tom 
Bradley's former City Council seat, losing to David Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Says his wife, Virginia, a real-estate probate referee for California who is 
studying for her BA at Cal State Dominguez Hills: "Herb has always focused on 
trying to improve those people who are disadvantaged. He has the general 
attitude that if people are given an opportunity, they will uplift themselves. 
That's Herb in a nutshell."

BATANGST IN BASIC BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As its trailer has already hinted, "Batman" (citywide) is very much a movie and 
a hero for the '80s. Is it interesting? Fitfully. Is it fun? Not much, Gotham 
City fans, not much. 
</P>
<P>
It's a murky, brooding piece, set in a twisted city almost choked with evil and 
inertia, and Bruce Wayne, half of its hero's dual identities, is very nearly in 
the same fix. Driven to right a naughty world the best that one man can, he's 
withdrawn, cerebral, severely absent-minded. As director Tim Burton sees him, 
he's practically the Hamlet of millionaire philanthropist socialites. 
</P>
<P>
When he puts on his Batmuscles and his Bathat, his Batjock, his Batgauntlets 
and his world heavyweight's Batbelt, almost nothing is left of him but 
glitteringly blue-gray eyes and a voluptuously full mouth. If a costume alone 
could stop crime, this one would, since it almost stops Michael Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
In the opposite corner, wearing purple satin, clown white, green hair and a 
permanent rictus, is the picture's big noise, the Joker, the dirtiest trickster 
since G. Gordon Liddy. Never still for a millisecond, Jack Nicholson's Joker 
preens and prances, drum major for a squad of sociopaths, detonating his 
noxious jokes like cherry bombs. ("You're insane!" Joker: "I thought I was a 
Pisces.") 
</P>
<P>
Director Burton has sensibly turned his back on the camp of the '60s "Batman" 
TV series, and has drawn his menacing atmosphere from the Gotham City of 
"Batman's" creator, Bob Kane. Burton read his audience right in that respect. 
And with the production designs of Anton Furst ("The Company of Wolves," "Full 
Metal Jacket") and Danny Elfman's darkly enveloping score, he has a shiveringly 
dense and poetic city against which to set his characters. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the screenplay, credited to both Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren 
from Hamm's story and Kane's characters, doesn't give those characters a 
fighting chance. It flops about, unsure of which of its scarred protagonists it 
finds the most seductive, and it's disastrously low on the sort of wit that can 
make a gargantuan movie lovable. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's first half hour is a thicket of exposition, yet it never answers a 
few basic Batquestions in every mind. The Joker we learn almost everything 
about: his plans to take over first the girlfriend (Jerry Hall), then the chair 
of crime lord Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Batman, his savvy butler Alfred (the 
estimable Michael Gough) and the Batgadgets remain annoyingly uninvestigated. 
So does the moment when Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale notices it's Bruce Wayne 
fiddling away in that Batcave. 
</P>
<P>
So Bruce Wayne was traumatized by witnessing the murder of his parents when he 
was 9, and that has led him into this double life of midnight vigilantism. Why 
bats? Wherefore bat caves? The fact that he's mortal makes him especially 
fascinating, yet the movie (and that Batrig) never lets us worry for a second 
that anything can happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
The volatile Keaton, an extremely interesting casting choice if he had a chance 
to let some of his dangerousness out, remains tamped-down and muted. His Bruce 
Wayne is as magnetic as one can make a character carved out of soap, but it's 
hardly Keaton's fault. As "ace photographer Vicki Vale," Basinger again does 
her magic of making a stock character warm, interesting and irreplaceable 
through some mysterious chemistry all her own. Meanwhile, Nicholson (quoted 
this week as saying, "I wanted to see how far I could go and I've never hit my 
head on top") has corkscrewed through the roof and is reaching into the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
The Joker begins as Gotham City gangster Jack Napier before a confrontation 
with Batman tips him into a vat of toxic waste, turning him into a party-hearty 
misanthrope. His notion is to paralyze Gothamites with Smylex gas and lethal 
toiletries. His target? Apparently anything that moves, including his own 
henchmen, and a few things that don't, like a museum's worth of the art 
treasures of the Western world, which go under in an orgy of slashing and 
splashing. He does spare one: a shrieking nightmare vision by contemporary 
Angst-master Francis Bacon that the Joker kinda likes. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism is supposed to suggest the lengths to which this sadist will go. 
There may even be a lost Ted Turner-colorizing joke somewhere in the melee. But 
not even the fact that the paintings look like K mart repros can keep this 
sequence from being a true stomach churner. Not in today's world of 
indiscriminate art whackos. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson's Joker will be the pivotal point for many. It's his energy, spurting 
like an artery, that keeps the picture alive; it's certainly not the special 
effects, the editing, which has no discernible rhythm, or the flaccid 
screenplay. Nicholson keeps things moving higher and higher, even with his 
reading of the line, "It's time to retire," throwing in a voice that's pure 
John Huston. 
</P>
<P>
But it's also a performance of such draining intensity and so few really 
quotable lines, most of which have been packed into the trailer, that it has us 
on the ropes begging for mercy long before the Joker waltzes into his climax. 
To a die-hard Nicholson fan, it's unthinkable that a day would come when you 
wished Jack Nicholson would get off the screen, just so this headache would let 
up for a minute. But "Batman" has managed it. Talk about a toxic waste. . . . 
</P>
<P>
(The Joker, with his gruesome death dealing, is also the cautionary figure for 
parents of young children. Take that PG-13 very seriously; this is where bad 
dreams are born.) 
</P>
<P>
The Joker's screaming machinations become so exhausting that to get away from 
them, we begin looking past him, straight into some puzzling inconsistencies. 
The gag of the TV anchorpersons, getting progressively scuzzy because they're 
afraid of sampling the Joker's line of killer-toiletries, is a funny one. Then 
why don't we see dapper Dans like Dist. Atty. Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams, 
thrown away in a sub-cameo) also getting frayed in the personal daintiness 
department? Does he have his own line of after shave? 
</P>
<P>
When, in a riotous parade through Gotham's scrunched-up streets, the Joker 
kills about a quarter of the revelers with poison gas, why don't the other 
hundreds swarm over him and beat that silly grin off his face? And in the bell 
tower "Vertigo" finale, after the three principals have inched their way 
perilously to the top, where in the name of holy Bat guano did those Joker 
henchmen come from? 
</P>
<P>
Sidestepped most disastrously is the meaning of the conflict between Batman and 
the Joker. Batman is hardly Superman, unscarred psychically, and his duel with 
a man who could have been another facet of his own personality should have 
resonated. Instead, the Joker has been demoted into a broad-scale sociopath, 
without a tempter's power or a mythic villain's complexity. And that's the 
movie's real undoing.

The British rock group the Who launched a 25th anniversary tour of North 
America Wednesday night before an audience of about 5,000 at Glens Falls Civic 
Center in Upstate New York, playing 40 songs during a three-hour show. Dressed 
in a baggy gray suit with his hair in a ponytail, lead guitarist Pete Townshend 
leaped in the air and banged power chords on his instrument with his trademark 
windmill motion. But in a concession to age and hearing damage caused by years 
of loud music, Townshend strummed an acoustic guitar for most of the show. The 
quartet was supplemented by 11 musicians, including a five-piece horn section, 
and played on a huge stage with gleaming mirrors as a backdrop. Except for two 
indoor performances of the rock opera "Tommy" in New York and Los Angeles, the 
24-city tour will play in outdoor stadiums. The band tonight will be in 
Toronto, the city that hosted the Who's last performance before their breakup 
in 1983. ALEENE MacMINN

The Craft and Folk Art Museum will be moving down Wilshire Boulevard to take up 
rent-free residence at the May Co. while awaiting its new home in a multiuse 
complex to be built on the Miracle Mile. The museum will close at its present 
location next Friday, opening this fall at the nearby May Co. (at Wilshire 
Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue) where it will have about twice as much gallery 
space on the store's fourth floor, said museum director Patrick Ela. The new 
complex is scheduled to be completed in 1992. ALEENE MacMINN

The Dance Theater of Harlem opened its 20th anniversary season Wednesday night 
in New York with a performance of "Giselle." "The fact that we have survived 
and gotten here in 20 years is a miracle," said Arthur Mitchell, executive 
director and co-founder of the company. Speaking before the performance, 
Mitchell thanked the audience for its support and the city of New York for a 
$2.5-million grant that will be used to renovate the Harlem facility and other 
properties. ALEENE MacMINN

Actor William Hurt's ophthalmologist testified Thursday at a palimony trial in 
state Supreme Court in Manhattan that she knew the Oscar winner was not married 
to former ballerina Sandra Jennings, but she was unable to explain why medical 
records identifying Jennings as his "spouse" in 1983 were later altered. "I 
know they were not married when they had the baby," testified Dr. Barbara 
Barker, who is also Hurt's personal friend. Asked by Jennings' attorney how she 
knew that, Barker responded, "Because he never called her 'my wife.' " 
Jennings, the mother of Hurt's 6-year-old son, is trying to prove she had a 
common-law marriage and is seeking half of Hurt's estimated $10-million 
earnings. Earlier, Hurt had testified that in August 1983 he wrote Jennings' 
name on a medical form in a box entitled "Spouse-Head of Household" because he 
considered her the head of the household. On the same form, in a box entitled 
"Marital Status," he wrote "mated." Barker was shown conflicting copies of a 
billing ledger, one with "Spouse: Sandra Jennings" at the top, but those words 
were deleted with white-out fluid on another copy. She testified that she did 
not know who altered the document. In other testimony, the child's former 
nanny, Linda Patrick of Brooklyn, said the actor once asked her, "How do you 
like working with my wife?' I said, 'Sandy? She seems to be a very nice 
person.' " The trial, in its fourth day, was adjourned until Monday morning.

STAGE BEAT : 'AWAKE AND SING' AT ACTORS FORUM; 'POPS' AT THE RICHMOND SHEPARD; 
'POLITICS' AT ITCHEY FOOT; 'MATINEE' AT 2ND STAGE; 'IRISH STEW' AT GYPSY 
</P>

<P>
You keep waiting for the curtain to rise on "Awake and Sing" at the Actors 
Forum Theatre, but it never does. Instead you watch Clifford Odets' struggling 
Bronx family through a gauzy, semi-transparent scrim -- an experience akin to 
watching quarrelsome neighbors through a screen door. 
</P>
<P>
French director Rene Migliaccio's expressionistic design also transfers this 
very realistic, 1935 Depression saga to a dreamlike setting of bare, gray walls 
that suggest a padded cell. These highly stylized features are initially 
infuriating because they seem to distance you from the otherwise naturalistic 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
As the show progresses, however, with the actors deliberately emoting like 
banshees in some cases, these stylized devices enable you to see the play anew, 
without clutter and from a purifying distance. The Bergers, Odets' unhappy 
Jewish family, are seen here as quintessential fish in a bowl. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good time for Odets' fans. The playwright's "Waiting for Lefty" (also 
from 1935) is receiving a fully realistic staging across town at the Company of 
Angels, and the two productions are a rare opportunity to view an important 
playwright from different perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the scenery chewing in "Awake and Sing" is outrageous and funny, the 
result is arresting. Prominent here are Steven Rosenbaum's coiled histrionics 
as the young son (a role created by John Garfield in the 1935 Group Theater 
production) and Anthony Gioia and Lisa Zebro in a Valentino-like seduction 
scene that pulls out all the stops and, remarkably, works. 
</P>
<P>
As the smoldering, sultry daughter, Zebro almost walks off with the show. Her 
presence is palpable merely smoking drearily in a chair and saying nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nine-member cast, Gioia bristles as the love-smitten boarder. Larry 
Turks' slavish in-law and Archie Lang's Caruso-playing grandfather add 
pen-and-ink detail. The production's serious misstep is Audrey Marlyn as the 
mother figure. Her scratchy voice and snarling demeanor are tiresome and 
unrelenting. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3365 1/2 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 
p.m., through July 9. Tickets: $10-$12.50; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Pops' 
</P>
<P>
Another New York family, an unsavory Italian household in contemporary 
Brooklyn, populates playwright Dennis Manuel's "Pops" at the Richmond Shepard 
Theatre. The is dirty-undershirt drama, salvaged by a son's quest for his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
The unredeeming title character is every woman's nightmare, complete with a 
tattoo, hairy arms, a volatile temper. And Eddie Zammit as the entitled Pops 
Vitelli delivers a furious, scabrous performance. Director Gary Blumsack stages 
a sexual abuse scene, central to the point of the play, that is notable for its 
ugly veracity. 
</P>
<P>
The human squalor is offset by the decency of Pops' common-law wife (Jean 
Sagal), his endearing mother (a feisty Eda Reiss Merin), his loyal buddy (Greg 
Mullavey), and, most important, his young adult, long missing son (Sandor 
Black, whose tremulous and sensitive performance is the show's ultimate 
strength). 
</P>
<P>
Vibrant acting here redeems to a measurable degree a predictable and surly 
play, which is further hampered by a flavorless and skimpy apartment room set. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6478 Santa Monica Blvd., Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., through July 
23. Tickets: $12.50-$15; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Politics of the Heart' 
</P>
<P>
The Itchey Foot's potential as a downtown cabaret theater is evident in its 
musical production, "Politics of the Heart," which is a winsome summer 
valentine. 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "Recent Musical Findings Regarding Modern Love," the show is a homage 
to love created and performed by Ed Munter, who cleverly and literally animates 
his songs with live sketches of hearts that materialize in assorted states of 
bliss and captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist-songwriter Munter, fronting his local band Izeneers (eyes and ears), 
is a down-home troubadour, effortlessly charting the faces of love on guitar, 
sketch pad and easel, harmonica and, humorously, over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bryan Rasmussen's blithesome direction, Munter and his two musicians 
(guitarist Larry Giannecchini and bassist Jay Mueller) conjure a pointed spell 
that never slips into sentimentality or mere balladeering. The most genuine 
touch in the intermissionless evening, though, is Munter's witty dexterity with 
his drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 At 801 W. Temple St., Wednesdays only, 8:30 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $8; 
(213) 680-0007. 
</P>
<P>
'Matinee' 
</P>
<P>
The stage is a movie house about to be torn down, where motley characters are 
in their seats waiting for the last matinee to unreel. 
</P>
<P>
The unseen, mysterious projectionist (God? The Reaper?) never does start the 
movie. A quarrelsome patron, an old man, dies and is left sprawled between the 
seats. A bag lady, a kid, a bartender and an usher act weird. The central 
character, a troubled ambulance driver (Douglas Van Leuven), tries to make 
sense of it all and goes off to find his destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of murky, ambitious plays that take place in movie theaters. "Matinee" 
at the 2nd Stage is incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Joseph D. Grantham, taking his inspiration from Joseph Campbell's 
classic study of a hero's mythic journey, "The Hero With a Thousand Faces," has 
attempted, he says, "to merge myth and reality in the dream world of the movie 
theater." The dreams here, modern exploration, mythic adventure, are grueling, 
garrulous and grinding. 
</P>
<P>
Craig M. Dickelman directed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 
p.m., through July 9. Tickets: $10; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Irish Stew / Yorkshire Pudding' 
</P>
<P>
You also might want to beware of Irish plays distinguished by great Irish 
accents -- and almost nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
"Irish Stew and Yorkshire Pudding," at the Gypsy Playhouse, is comprised of 
three one-acts by Charles Kray that are, in each case, shaggy-dog stories that 
would make cute telling in a pub or amusing five- to 10-minute comedic 
sketches. But "The Darlin Hero, "Droit du Seigneur," and "A Tale of a Cat" each 
run on endlessly, way past their mischievous points. 
</P>
<P>
There are no characterizations or relationships or social contexts worth 
savoring, beyond little elfin-like yarns. This is truly theater of the absurd. 
Some of the actors, who play multiple roles, are quaintly funny -- if you like 
quaint. 
</P>
<P>
John York directed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3321 W. Olive Ane., Burbank, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 
p.m., through Aug. 13. Tickets: $6-$10; (818) 954-9858.

DON AMENDOLIA IS 'STEPPING OUT' AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two years, Don Amendolia has been suffering from what he calls 
"interruptus." 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, he was on Broadway, stepping high in Richard Harris' "Stepping 
Out," when the producers abruptly pulled the plug. "Of all the shows I've done, 
this was the hardest: hardest to stage, hardest to rehearse. But our souls were 
in that piece. It's not just the script. It's the people you're working with, 
the room you're rehearsing in. So it was a stunning thing when we closed." 
</P>
<P>
Amendolia will get another chance at "Stepping Out" on Sunday, when it opens at 
the Pasadena Playhouse -- with him on board as co-star and director. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a British comedy about a group of misfits who meet once a week in a 
London church basement for dance lessons," said the actor-director, who was 
last seen performing here in "My One and Only" (Ahmanson, 1985). "There are 
nine women and one man: my character, Geoffrey. It's really a slice of life, 
about tiny people and tiny lives. It's all minutiae, not important -- except in 
the grand scale, of course, it's very important. And for some reason, it's very 
heartwarming. Every night on Broadway, audiences screamed for these people." 
</P>
<P>
Which made the loss even worse. "It's a stupid business," he said wearily, "a 
business of passions. So you go away and lick your wounds, then come out and 
keep on keepin' on. It's a precarious life at best. Oh, a few people warn you, 
but what does that mean? Half of this business is luck, and I've been pretty 
lucky. I've always worked. There haven't been too many lean times. And just as 
no one can prepare you for the disappointments, no one can prepare you for the 
highs. The highs are so high for me." 
</P>
<P>
In his two years away from this show, Amendolia (whose local directing credits 
include "80 Days" at the La Jolla Playhouse and "Born Yesterday" at the 
Pasadena Playhouse, both last year) has managed to retain his enthusiasm for 
the project, in spite of a number of setbacks -- including the bowing-out of 
planned star Sandy Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just as well," Amendolia said philosophically. "After I reread the 
piece, I realized it really can't have a star. It's a true ensemble show -- 
you've either got to have all stars or no stars. See, when you cast a star in 
the role, the audience can't help but think the star is the protagonist and 
watch them: 'What are they going to do?' This isn't that kind of piece. The 
whole point is that these are nobodies. Having a star would really throw it out 
of balance." 
</P>
<P>
Four members of the Broadway cast are reprising their roles: Janet Eilber, 
Victoria Boothby, Sheryl Sciro and understudy David Doty. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my conditions was that I have my understudy from New York, because he 
already knew what I did -- and it would be a lot easier for me to rehearse," 
said Amendolia, who swears his own song-and-dance training was limited to a 
movement class and "maybe 15" voice lessons. "Another condition was that they 
let him go on once a week. He should have a showcase. He's worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Amendolia expressed no qualms about taking over the reins from 
the show's original director, Tommy Tune. After all, he did it once before with 
Tune on "Cloud Nine" (which Amendolia directed -- and acted in -- at L.A. Stage 
Company West in 1983, garnering him a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award 
for his direction). "This show is much different from 'Cloud Nine,' where I was 
pretty much hired to replicate the original," he said. "And yet I think I 
brought my own thing to 'Cloud Nine.' I know I did." 
</P>
<P>
Will his production of this piece have any resemblance to Tune's? 
</P>
<P>
"That was two years ago," Amendolia said with a shrug. "I don't really remember 
much of the staging. Obviously I can't negate that experience in my life. But 
I'm not out to reinvent the wheel; I just want to do a good production -- and 
improve it. You know, directing's a lot more than telling people where to walk 
and talk. It's getting them to think the way you want them to think, so that 
all together they bring in the desired result. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things I'm doing very differently. In New York, the finale was 
so lavish, so wonderful. Well, that bothered me -- because these people 
couldn't do it. It should be the best that these people can do. So I took out 
the chaser lights. It should be someone's Christmas tree lights from home. I 
want my set to be dingier, more like a basement. Of course, there's only so far 
you can go with that. After all, you don't want to depress the audience."

JANIS SIEGEL ILLUMINES AT MY PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janis Siegel has not transferred out of Manhattan. She has simply found a 
productive way to spend her spare time, teamed with the protean pianist Fred 
Hersch. To follow up their just released album, they took a two-night At My 
Place gig, with results that indicate a promising future for the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel does not want to be identified as a jazz singer, and rightly so, since 
her first show Tuesday drew from many sources. On certain tunes such as Todd 
Rundgren's "Pretending to Care" and the old Miriam Makeba hit "Love Tastes Like 
Strawberries," her voice had a folksy charm, as if she were playing Patti with 
Hersch as a pianistic counterpart of Tuck. 
</P>
<P>
What Siegel avoids is as significant as what she includes: Unlike several newly 
popular singers, she eschews mannerisms, using melisma very little, scatting 
only occasionally, and showing respect for the melodies. 
</P>
<P>
Her pure sound and easy range were sensitively backed by Hersch, and on some 
numbers also by the superlative bassist Tony Dumas. Her mood swings were a joy 
as she made a quantum leap from a trivial old ditty, "Rhythm in My Nursery 
Rhymes," to a Brazilian setting in Djavan's "Agua." 
</P>
<P>
For the jazz-oriented there was a fine old Bobby Troup ballad, "The Meaning of 
the Blues," along with two actual blues, the vocalese "Jackie" (an old Annie 
Ross-Wardell Gray fable about a be-bop mouse) and Helen Humes' "Million-Dollar 
Secret." The latter was the only song that seemed lyrically unsuited to her. 
Siegel drew on the repertoire of Take 6 for the swinging "Goldmine," and of 
Brenda Russell for a poignant "Piano in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
Song for song, artist for artist, this most musical hour by three major talents 
was an utter delight -- the kind of performance music industry moguls classify 
as too good to be commercial. They have already been proven wrong; the 
Siegel-Hersch album is selling far beyond the record company's expectations.

As a young prodigy, Ireland's leading painter, Patrick Graham, won prestigious 
drawing awards, then fell into despair and drink. In his words, he experienced 
"complete loss" only to discover creative "revival" in the "raw honesty" of 
Emile Nolde. 
</P>
<P>
Graham's anguished mixed-media drawings and large oils make a Sartre-ian 
balancing act of "being and nothingness," recognizable form and inchoate marks. 
In "Cold and Fatal Heroes," a skein of lines barely describes a tattered 
soldier/drummer with the existentialist credo, "Love Can Be Colder Than Death," 
scrawled above. Next to this, a spectral face spouts dwarfed arms that cradle a 
glob of hot vermilion swaddled like the Christ child. 
</P>
<P>
Other works feature brutal figures, faces, coffins emerging out of sooty, 
agitated fields and maelstroms of marks, symbols and writing. There are shadowy 
fetus forms, haloed hearts and Christlike torsos often accented with fake 
flowers, magazine cut-outs, Polaroid photos of works in progress or painted 
designs that suggest stained glass. Graham's commendable desire to subvert 
superficial finery can get excessive. The best works poke at sexual, religious, 
political, filial and creative Angst with a wrenching Irish despair that makes 
most American Neo-Ex look like a comfortable game of charades. (Jack Rutberg

Nine toothy, ravishing pieces from the late '70s and early '80s by Robert 
Rauschenberg and strong works by a clutch of younger artists are good reasons 
for roaming the vast square-footage of Ace Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Rauschenberg's massive works include broad swatches of fabric, often 
juxtaposed with monolithic gray passages of newspaper want ads or stock tables. 
The thin fabric, with its disciplined designs or loosely woven, almost 
painterly wash of color, offers a low-pitched visual hum, setting off the 
familiar barrage of images borrowed from diverse printed sources. In other 
pieces, reflective metal surfaces add the viewer's image into the piece and 
present a colder, post-industrial-age veneer. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the works seem to be about the new coldness of the urban '80s and 
its contrast with the values of other times and places. But there is really no 
such notion as "in general" in this work, which persistently toys with allusive 
-- some would say elusive -- visual rhymes. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Lurid Attack of the Monsters from the Postal News Aug 1875," a 
freestanding piece from 1981, four antique sharp-toothed metal cutting tools 
form hoops over a wood incline upholstered in all manner of patterns: 
geometric, dotted, striped, moire, freeform, flocked and a tapestry-like scene. 
The photographic images include stock tables and men who seem to be performing 
some kind of physical test, people in gas masks, a skeleton and an owl. 
</P>
<P>
Who could say with certainty how the rhymes shake out here? Somehow the whole 
thing has a brash, insistent and oddly lyrical presence that resists decoding, 
but lures the viewer to bask in its sensory richness. 
</P>
<P>
The younger artists, glimpsed in mini-shows, are quietly provocative in cooler 
ways. Ross Rudel's very small wall sculpture alludes to body parts and rather 
unsettling physical states. The center of a square plaster piece looks as 
though it's being sucked inward. A black wood square oozes into an 
ever-so-slightly veined testicular droop. A fabric-textured plaster piece is 
suggestively rubbed soft in one area. 
</P>
<P>
David Amico continues to invent vivid conjunctions of form and engulfing space. 
In his painting, "Presenting," a crenellated dark shape repeats -- with 
constant variations in shape and brushwork -- in orderly rows washed by a 
multicolored soft ground. In "A Sliver of Light Shining Bright," a trio of gray 
forms that look like rope tricks are cast adrift in a violet-white atmosphere 
cut by a crescent of white light. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hermann's new paintings vibrate with a teeming curved wrought iron motif 
that devours decorativeness in the search for a new kind of energy. When Robert 
Zoell isn't doing deadpan, dumb paintings of big dots on solid, bright 
surfaces, he is playing slyly reductive perceptual games in a sky-blue painting 
in which the thinnest imaginable relief and intaglio lines form a ghostly 
octagon. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Stella Sanchez's work has an impregnable, sullen aura. Real syringes 
inject each of a set of dull-green square paintings with troubled surfaces that 
erupt in various homely configurations of bumps. John Millei's small, wispy 
paintings on paper are hard to figure. Maybe they're about the process of 
siting forms in space or attempting to read forms that stray from the high road 
of geometry. (Ace Contemporary Exhibitions, 5514 Wilshire Blvd., to July 5.)

Pieces of unstretched, silver-coated primed canvas ripped into rectangles form 
the ground for John McCormick's tantalizing fragments of written narrative. His 
stark paintings usually consist of a single rough black sketch related 
literally to the lines of script. Often the words are obscured by the image as 
they verbally weep thoughts of death or frustrated dreams. The power of 
McCormick's images lies in their poignance. Phrases are intriguing. They make 
up in poetry what the drawings lack in invention, capturing something of the 
soul-bruising pain of an encounter with conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Next to McCormick's paintings, Steve Tannen's precise irregular wood panels are 
cut and dried. Each painting is a abstracted Puritan work ethic parable touting 
steadfast effort in the pursuit of noble ideals. If the geometric symbolism 
seems simplistic, the work is alluring nonetheless for its glowing color and 
the sheer excellence of its craft and painting. 
</P>
<P>
In the front entry of the gallery is a fragmented, colorless and cynical 
installation by Steve Heino entitled "Naval Science." Suggesting instruments 
used in navigation and a ghostly hull floating in thin air, the works create a 
haunting but frustrating walk though a unmarked navy museum for the terminally 
lost. More a collection of unrelated individual items than a single 
installation, these beacons and buoys refuse to interrelate so that every line 
of sight leads determinedly to a blank wall. Stoic isolation and a series of 
dead ends makes each piece an island of purposeless existence. (Jan Baum

The scientific discovery that the universe is continuing to "bang" outward 
gives artists the fits just like every other mortal who senses his own demise 
as more than just an abstraction. "Unstable Universe," a current group show, 
addresses that abstraction and gives it a vivid pictorial grounding. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit uses paintings by several artists to create a kind of cosmic 
womb-to-tomb experience. To walk around the gallery is to snatch a series of 
ideas that leap time and space in carefully choreographed rapid bounds. In this 
context Jack Goldstein's rich red and yellow thermal throb becomes the big 
pulse of rippling life sent out into the blackness of space. That life, as 
pictured by Vernon Fisher, is a precariously balanced thing, ticking away like 
a planetary time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the oracles of doom are everywhere. They are under Robert Yarber's 
mythologic, cloud-swept skies and in Andy Moses' densely layered painting of 
microscopic proteins that mirror the happenstance of oil-and-water paint 
separation and planetary photos of stars going nova. They echo a dire warning 
across Ed Ruscha's fire colored sunset, "I Remember, to Forget, to Remember." 
Yet in John Murphy's star chart, "Fine Veils of Endurance (Horologium)," all 
that gloom seems at last overblown as his inky space shows the universe 
continuing despite one planet's demise. It's a curiously objective note to end 
on, but welcome after staring the inevitable in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Group shows organized around a theme are seldom this concise or this directed. 
With admirable restraint this one forgoes the opportunity to embellish the 
narrative with peripheral thoughts like exploring more of the artist's work, or 
the notion of assigning blame for the ultimate Armageddon. (Asher/Faure, 612 N. 
Almont Drive, to July 1). SUVAN GEER

HOME TECH: SUPER VHS RECORDERS NOW HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS CHEAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's good news for anyone who's thinking about buying a Super VHS 
videocassette recorder: Prices are coming down at last. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since they were introduced two years ago, improved-picture S-VHS decks 
listed for $1,100 up and could seldom be found even at discount stores for less 
than $1,000. But in recent weeks, some Los Angeles-area stores have offered new 
models by JVC, Magnavox and others for hundreds less. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Magnavox's Model VR9668. Though it doesn't boast every bell and 
whistle (no audio dubbing, for example), this VCR has Super VHS, hi-fi stereo 
sound, MTS decoding, HQ circuitry, indexing and bar-code programming. Like all 
S-VHS decks, it will play and record normal VHS tapes as well. The price around 
town on a recent check -- $749 at Circuit City, $729 at Adray's and $595 at 
Star Club in Culver City. (Star Club also had JVC's S-VHS 5000U, which does 
have audio dubbing, for $700.) 
</P>
<P>
That's not much more than normal VHS decks with all of those features except 
S-VHS. If prices continue to fall and enough buyers say, "Why not?," we may 
begin to see the fall of Super VHS acceptance's other main obstacle -- the lack 
of pre-recorded material. 
</P>
<P>
The release this week of "The Best of Gilda Radner" (Warner, $19.98) isn't a 
rushed response to the comedian's death from cancer May 20. Warner Home Video 
announced the tape two months ago. The 59-minute compilation of clips from 
"Saturday Night Live" follows similar packages spotlighting John Belushi and 
Dan Aykroyd. It features Radner's most famous characterizations, including 
nerdy teen Lisa Loopner and befuddled consumerist Roseanne Roseannadanna. 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" (Warner, $89.95, R) didn't make Clint Eastwood's day at the box office. 
Of course, the former mayor of Carmel only directed this filmography of 
saxophonist Charlie (Yardbird) Parker -- he doesn't appear in it. Still, the 
low gross -- just over $2 million -- proved disappointing to jazz fans, 
especially after the success of "Round Midnight" in 1986. However, the poor 
showing at theaters may be followed by jazzed-up video interest; the film 
received several good reviews. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (Orion, $89.98, PG) scored big at 
the box office and probably will with summer-fun-minded renters too. The remake 
of the 1964 comedy "Bedtime Story" places Steve Martin and Michael Caine in the 
con-men roles originally played by Marlon Brando and David Niven. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the 1988 Academy Award for best foreign film, "Pelle the 
Conqueror" (HBO, $89.99, not MPAA rated), stars Max Von Sydow in a bleak look 
at life on a Danish farm. "Torch Song Trilogy" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) is the 
widely panned film version of Harvey Fierstein's play. "Tapeheads" (Pacific 
Arts, $89.95, R) stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins in a satiric comedy a la 
"Spinal Tap" about two security guards who want to make rock videos. 
</P>
<P>
Also out on video this week: "Buster" (HBO, $89.99, R), "Travelling North" 
(Virgin, $79.95, PG-13), "Eye of the Eagle II" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R), "Cohen and 
Tate" (Nelson, $89.98, R) and "Saturday the 14th Strikes Back" (MGM/UA, $79.95, 
PG). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Like your music video classical or non-classical? 
</P>
<P>
If classical, then there's "Manon" (with Beverly Sills, 1977), "James Galway 
Plays Mostly Mozart" (1982) and "Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman" 
(1980) from Bel Canto's "Live from Lincoln Center" series ($29.95 each). 
</P>
<P>
If non-classical, there's a new tape by the kings of speed-metal, "Metallica: 2 
of One" (Elektra, $9.98), containing two versions of the song "One," an 
eight-minute conceptual video and a five-minute performance. And coinciding 
with the new rock filmography "Great Balls of Fire" is the hourlong concert 
film/documentary "Jerry Lee Lewis: I Am What I Am" (J2, $19.95). TERRY ATKINSON

HOME TECH: HOLLY, CASH HITS REVISITED AS CDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most engaging nights on the Los Angeles club scene occurs each Jan. 
8 when a couple of dozen local rockers gather at the Music Machine to salute 
Elvis Presley's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians perform their favorite Elvis songs (or sometimes Elvis' dumbest 
recordings) with a sense of relaxed fun rather than competitive tension. 
</P>
<P>
That same, inviting spirit is reflected in "Every Day Is a Holly Day," a 
delightful tribute to another classic '50s rocker, Buddy Holly. 
</P>
<P>
Just released in the United States by Emergo Records, the album was produced in 
France by Patrick Mathe of New Rose Records to mark the 30th anniversary of 
Holly's death in a Feb. 3, 1959 plane crash. It features 17 chiefly 
roots-minded rockers, each performing one song by or associated with Holly. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, best known within alternative rock circles, range from the Shoes 
(doing "Words of Love") and Elliott Murphy ("Everyday") to Chris Spedding 
("It's So Easy"), Tav Falco's Panther Burns ("Peggy Sue"), the Lolitas ("Not 
Fade Away") and Chris Bailey ("It Doesn't Matter Any More"). 
</P>
<P>
Much the same affectionate, good-natured spirit is also exhibited in a salute 
to Johnny Cash that was released earlier this year in England by Red Rhino 
Records to raise funds for an AIDS-related campaign. Titled " 'Til Things Are 
Brighter," the 13-song album is available here in shops that carry CD imports. 
It, too, features artists best known by alternative rock fans. 
</P>
<P>
Among the participants: Michelle Shocked ("One Piece at a Time"), Pete Shelley 
("Straight A's in Love"), the Mekons ("Folsom Prison Blues") and Marc Almond 
("Man in Black"). 
</P>
<P>
A second compilation, just relased in England by Start Records, also salutes a 
classic rock figure, Bob Dylan, but this album brings together previously 
released recordings rather than versions recorded specifically for the album. 
Also unlike the other two salutes, "The Songs of Bob Dylan" features mostly 
internationally known artists. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-minute CD (an even longer two-record vinyl set is also available) 
features Bryan Ferry ("A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"), Elvis Presley ("Tomorrow's 
a Long Time"), the Byrds ("Mr. Tambourine Man"), Siouxsie and the Banshees 
("This Wheel's on Fire"), Eric Clapton ("Knockin' on Heaven's Door") and Jerry 
Lee Lewis ("Rita Mae"). 
</P>
<P>
CD BUDGET FILE: Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett's "Julie and Carol at Carnegie 
Hall" (originally released in 1962) and separate 16-selection, easy-listening 
retrospectives by Percy Faith, Mitch Miller and Jim Nabors have all been 
released by Columbia Records. . . . Among the sound-tracks just released in CD 
by Capitol: "Giant," "The Deer Hunter" and "Romeo and Juliet". . . . PolyGram 
has issued five albums Chuck Berry recorded in the '60s for Mercury after 
leaving Chess Records, where he did his most acclaimed work. They include "Live 
at the Fillmore". . . . PolyGram has also released in CD seven early Kiss 
packages, including "Alive" and "Alive II."

'MALA NOCHE': FILM WITH GAY THEME AIRS ON KCET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gus Van Sant's "Mala Noche" won the L.A. Film Critics Assn.'s best independent 
feature award in 1987 and, more important, led to his next picture, "Drugstore 
Cowboy," starring Matt Dillon as a drug addict trying to go straight. It's due 
for release in August. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a one-time screening in the 1987 Gay and Lesbian Film/Video 
Festival, "Mala Noche" has yet to play a Los Angeles theatrical engagement, 
which is more a comment on the commercial fate of gay-themed films than on the 
quality of this picture, which airs at 11:30 tonight on Channel 28. (Better 
late than never.) 
</P>
<P>
A film of rare tenderness and longing, involving both humor and anguish, which 
was adapted and directed by Van Sant from an autobiographical novel by Walt 
Curtis, "Mala Noche," which is Spanish for "bad night," is set on Portland's 
Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
It stars Tim Streeter as Walt, who runs a small grocery store and who is one of 
the most self-accepting, laid-back gay men ever seen on the screen. A young man 
with a Don Johnson stubble, Walt is a completely masculine guy who could easily 
"pass" for straight but is instead open about his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, when two teen-aged Mexican illegals, the angelic-looking Johnny 
(Doug Cooeyate) and the husky Roberto (Ray Monge) turn up on Skid Row, Walt 
does nothing to disguise his attraction to Johnny, with whom he falls instantly 
in love. Never mind that Johnny, steeped in machismo, is reflexibly homophobic; 
Walt is the persistent type. 
</P>
<P>
Shot beautifully in black-and-white by John Campbell, "Mala Noche" has an easy, 
confident flow and is spontaneous and economical. In a voiceover, Walt tells us 
that he doesn't want to interfere in Johnny and Roberto's lives, but the 
Mexicans' desperate circumstances and Walt's desires inevitably accommodate 
each other, if only fleetingly. 
</P>
<P>
The friendship between Walt and the teen-agers is edgy, full of skirmishes, 
sometimes tense, other times playful. It could be argued that Walt exploits the 
Mexicans, but it could also be countered that they exploit him, too. What's 
important is that Walt, a caring man, is honest with himself and with them. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant is terrific with his cast, and Streeter couldn't be better as the 
resilient, risk-taking Walt, a man who's utterly realistic and even humorous 
about his own romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
For all its frisky, good-natured quality, "Mala Noche" has a dark undertow of 
danger and is serious about the plight of illegals. The language is blunt, but 
the sex is discreet, and "Mala Noche" is a highly ingratiating film for 
sophisticated adult audiences. KEVIN THOMAS

CATHOLIC BISHOPS PROHIBIT MASSES FOR GAY, LESBIAN GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL CHANDLER, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles and 12 other bishops from Southern 
and Central California on Thursday firmly prohibited Roman Catholic priests 
from celebrating Masses sponsored by Dignity, the national independent 
organization of gay and lesbian Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
A statement initiated by Mahony said the bishops' action stemmed from Dignity's 
repudiation of the church's "clear and constant moral teaching" against 
homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
The policy reiterated the official church position that "while . . . homosexual 
orientation in itself is not to be regarded as a sinful condition . . . genital 
activity by unmarried persons, or by married persons without being open to 
procreation, is morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Chapter in Orange 
</P>
<P>
There is no separate Dignity chapter in Orange County, according to Father 
Lawrence J. Baird, communications director for the Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing; it's been a non-issue here" as far as the diocese in concerned, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was approved by the bishops in the Province of Los Angeles, which 
includes the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the dioceses of Orange, San 
Bernardino, San Diego, Fresno and Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
At its last national convention, in July, 1987, Dignity adopted a resolution 
saying that "gay and lesbian people can express their sexuality physically in a 
unitive manner that is loving, life-giving and life-affirming" and demanding 
that the church hierarchy re-examine its views on homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very hurt and rejected by what the archbishop did," said Jack 
Castiglione, membership chairman of the Long Beach Dignity chapter. "The church 
should be opening its doors to all groups of Catholics who seek support and 
spiritual growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disallowed use of church property two years ago and now to be denied 
Mass is the ultimate rejection." 
</P>
<P>
Castiglione said the Long Beach chapter, which sponsors Masses, "rap groups" 
and social events for about 350 people in Orange County and beach cities in Los 
Angeles County, will continue its Sunday night meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Stafford, president of Dignity, Los Angeles, said that chapter would hold 
its next scheduled worship service July 2 at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in 
Hollywood but has not decided if it will be a Catholic Mass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Did Not Keep Promise' 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the archbishop was considering this," Stafford said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"But after what I felt was a very warm, open meeting with him in March, he 
assured us he would let us know prior to its happening. . . . I'm deeply 
grieved the archbishop did not keep his promise." 
</P>
<P>
Stafford said the bishops' action was in keeping with a Vatican letter issued 
Oct. 30, 1986, by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Congregation for the 
Doctrine of the Faith. 
</P>
<P>
Writing to the world's bishops, Ratzinger said homosexual relationships tended 
toward "an intrinsic moral evil." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's directive follows an earlier edict by Mahony that barred Dignity 
from celebrating Masses in any facility owned by the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dignity chapters have been similarly ousted from church-owned facilities in 
many major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, according to Tom Carroll, Dignity's director for California and 
Nevada, Dignity Masses "are being said by Roman Catholic priests all across 
America, some with the knowledge and approval of their bishops, others 
secretly, and still others defiantly." 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-member organization headquartered in Washington was founded 20 years 
ago and has 110 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony wrote all priests of the 3.39-million-member Los Angeles archdiocese 
June 14, advising them of the ban, according to a copy of a letter furnished to 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The California bishops stressed that they had "no other choice" but to order 
all their priests not to celebrate Dignity Masses "in any setting or for any 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
"For people who are not married, heterosexual or homosexual, chastity . . . is 
the Christian moral obligation to which Christ calls us," they said. 
</P>
<P>
But the bishops added that if Dignity were to "embrace the full teachings of 
the church on human sexuality, we would be open to review and to reconsider our 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Some Roman Catholic dioceses around the nation sponsor Courage, a ministry that 
seeks to help gay men and lesbian women lead chaste lives. 
</P>
<P>
Such groups encourage "our homosexual and lesbian brothers and sisters" to take 
part in the Mass and the sacraments, the California bishops noted, "so they can 
offer and receive mutual support in living out their lives of faithful 
discipleship." 
</P>
<P>
But Castiglione declared that many homosexual Catholics "feel uncomfortable" in 
the local parish. "So, in effect, the archbishop has denied many of us the 
sacrament of communion," he said.

PROSECUTORS SAY ARTICLE FUELED PERI SPY DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Army Spec. Michael A. Peri's fantasies of espionage were fueled by a magazine 
article he read about the Marine spy scandal in Moscow, leading him to give 
military secrets to the East Germans, prosecutors suggested to a court-marital 
jury in West Germany on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Peri seemed fascinated by a Time magazine story he read on Feb. 17, friends 
told military investigators, and bragged that his security clearance allowed 
him access to top secret information of the type obtained by the Soviet agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The friends thought the death penalty would be warranted (for the Marine 
guards who allowed Soviets to view U.S. Embassy documents), and Peri thought 
prison was enough," Maj. Michael D. Graham, the Army prosecutor, told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, however, described Peri as "a very immature young man . . . 
who acted out of despair, curiosity and fear." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County soldier was isolated and childish, but no spy, defense 
attorney Michael Christensen said during the first day of Peri's sentencing 
hearing Thursday. Peri, 22, pleaded guilty to espionage charges Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. didn't bring Michael to justice," Christensen told jurors, according 
to a report by Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military's newspaper for its 
personnel in Europe. "He did it on his own. He brought himself back to face the 
consequences of his immature, childlike actions. This is not a spy case." 
</P>
<P>
Peri, who testified Wednesday that his trip to East Germany on Feb. 20 was 
prompted by frustration with his military intelligence job, faces a maximum 
punishment of life in prison. He sat impassively through sentencing arguments 
Thursday at the Army Community Center in Fulda, West Germany. His parents, Fred 
and Winnie Peri of Laguna Niguel, attended the first day of court-martial 
proceedings Wednesday, but left Thursday's hearing after selection of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said that three days after Peri read the spy article, he crossed into 
East Germany with a stolen laptop computer and four floppy discs that contained 
secret information on how the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the Army's 
front-line unit for defense of West Germany, would respond to a Soviet attack. 
An analysis showed the information had been copied by the East German 
officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The military prosecutor read aloud a 17-page report that had been prepared by 
military investigators and signed by Peri. The report revealed new details 
about Peri's trip to East Germany and eventual surrender. 
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Peri read the Time article during a four-day weekend 
in the nearby city of Wildfeld, where he and a roommate visited a Peri family 
friend. After returning on the 20th, Peri was seen at a Fulda bank where he 
withdrew $120 from a savings account, leaving only $3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skipped Special Dessert 
</P>
<P>
Peri then went out to dinner with two friends, but instead of meeting them at a 
second restaurant, where Peri had suggested they all go for a special dessert, 
he returned to his barracks in the 11th Armored Cavalry headquarters in Fulda, 
the report states. Peri packed a sport bag with clothing and then breached 
security by going unaccompanied into the double-locked vault of the military 
intelligence unit and taking the computer and discs. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told investigators they spotted Peri at several locations on the 
military post that night, and one soldier reported that he saw Peri in a 
laundry room, with his face wet as though he had been crying. Flares spotted by 
West German customs officials at 11:15 that night are believed to have marked 
Peri's discovery by East German soldiers, the document stated. Peri had checked 
out a military vehicle and drove to a spot about a mile from the East German 
border. 
</P>
<P>
The report revealed little about Peri's whereabouts or activities in East 
Germany, information that Peri gave to Army intelligence experts during 
interviews June 6 to 9 on the condition that it not be used to prosecute him. 
However, the report stated that while in East Berlin on March 1, Peri signed 
two declarations, stating that he did not wish to contact U.S. authorities and 
that he wanted to go to Austria, where he had attended high school when his 
family lived in Europe in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials notified U.S. diplomats that Peri had been released to 
the country of his choice on March 3. Later that day, Peri left the East German 
capital and traveled by train to Salzburg, Austria, where, he told authorities, 
he stayed in a 5-star hotel. He said he made no attempt to contact his parents 
or U.S. officials while in Salzburg, and returned by train to Fulda the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carried $200 on Return 
</P>
<P>
Peri, who was missing for 12 days, walked through the gates of the post at 
Fulda and surrendered to military police on March 4. When he was searched, Peri 
carried the equivalent of about $200 in U.S. and West German currency. It was 
not revealed where he obtained the additional money. 
</P>
<P>
Although Peri's attorney, a civilian who is military legal officer for the Utah 
National Guard, insisted that Peri "did not divulge any important secrets" to 
East German officials, prosecutors said they will call intelligence experts to 
testify on the damage caused by his disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, testimony by Peri's supervising officer disputed Christensen's 
claim that the soldier functions at the level of "a 9- to 11-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Timothy J. Quinn told jurors that he considered Peri "a good, 
above-average soldier; a smart and trusted kid." Quinn said Peri had access to 
"higher than top secret documents" and added that additional security 
precautions are now taken in the intelligence unit because of the thefts by 
Peri. 
</P>
<P>
Another Army official testified Thursday that an intensive, three-day search 
for Peri, begun on Feb. 23 when a military vehicle Peri signed out was found in 
a shallow ditch just a mile from the East German border, cost $1 million to 
$1.2 million in salaries, vehicles and aircraft hours. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing hearing is expected to continue through Saturday.

<P>
To qualify as the youngest aviator to fly around the world, 11-year-old Tony 
Aliengena has had to remain in sole control of his father's single-engine 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
But while the fourth-grader from San Juan Capistrano has single-handedly flown 
the craft nearly halfway around the globe, the key decisions regarding flight 
routes and whether to fly in inclement weather have been made by his father, 
Gary Aliengena, and three other adult pilots on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has participated rarely in airport briefings attended by the adult pilots. 
Instead, he has watched cartoons, played with children his own age or slept 
until his father told him it was time to go. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena said he saw nothing wrong with Tony not being involved in every 
aspect of the flight. He likened his role to that of a commercial airline 
co-pilot whose job is to prepare the flight plan for the pilot. In the cockpit, 
Aliengena said, Tony makes all the critical decisions, such as whether to 
ascend or descend to avoid bad weather. He does get plenty of advice from his 
father in the co-pilot's seat and from Gunter Hagen, a National Aeronautic 
Assn. observer who is going along to verify that Tony remains in control. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena also serves as the plane's pilot-in-command, since Tony is too young 
to get a pilot's license. Aliengena can seize control of the plane at any time 
if he decides Tony cannot handle an emergency situation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, Aliengena has not had to touch the controls. 
</P>
<P>
In planning for the flight and plotting strategy, the clear leader of the adult 
pilots has been Aliengena, a 39-year-old real estate investor. 
</P>
<P>
The other pilots have included Dr. Lance Allyn, 46, an orthopedic surgeon from 
Hanford, Calif., in one chase plane and Pat Wiesner, 52, a Denver magazine 
publisher, in the other chase plane. Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from 
Malibu, also is a veteran pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner was forced to drop out of the trip after he was stranded in Greenland 
for four days because of an equipment problem. Wiesner had been carrying four 
members of a Los Angeles film crew, who are now taking commercial flights to 
keep up with Tony. 
</P>
<P>
Although all four pilots have many years of aviation experience, their styles 
have differed so markedly that some personality clashes have resulted, 
particularly between Aliengena and Wiesner. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena is a bold pilot whose former pastimes of aerobatics and sky diving 
make him unafraid to venture out in bad weather. "I don't worry about the 
weather until it's time to fly," he said. "Then I work around it." 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner is an ultraconservative pilot who frets about such matters as excess 
aircraft weight and who dislikes conversation in flight. On the eve of the June 
16 Atlantic crossing, Wiesner and Aliengena exchanged tense words over the fact 
that Wiesner was considering sending three people from his plane aboard a 
commercial jet to reduce weight. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat, you've had a long time to prepare for this," Aliengena said angrily in a 
hotel room in arctic Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen and Allyn, like Wiesner, exhibit a conservative aviation style. Last 
week, for instance, they sat up nights to pore over aviation charts, planning 
and re-planning for the flight's biggest challenge: crossing the North 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
But they, like Aliengena, are more inclined to extend themselves than Wiesner. 
On the matter of weight, for example, Allyn has continually carried as much as 
500 pounds more cargo than his twin-engine Beechcraft King Air was designed to 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
They also are inclined to talk and joke in the cockpit. Allyn even let 
film-crew member Shawn Hardin fly his plane for an hour above the frozen tundra 
of northern Canada. 
</P>
<P>
And Hagen, though he frequently worried about weather, has always climbed 
aboard Tony's plane. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have is that I'm just along for the ride," said Hagen. "But I 
promised myself that I wouldn't fly if I thought it was unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, daring as he is, knows better than to send his son into a raging 
thunderstorm. For that reason, Tony detoured 100 miles to escape a severe line 
of storms over the Rocky Mountains. Aliengena also took the precaution of 
sending his wife, Susan, and 10-year-old daughter, Alaina, in Allyn's King Air 
when it came time to cross the North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Another strain between the pilots occurred as the flight from Canada began. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wiesner and Allyn had expressed concern over their weight load in Boston, 
where they arranged to have 1,000 pounds of unnecessary luggage and equipment 
shipped ahead to Europe or back to California. Much of the equipment belonged 
to the film crew. 
</P>
<P>
Allyn and Wiesner, who was piloting a twin-engine Cessna Golden Eagle, 
explained that for every 200 pounds of extra weight they lost half an hour's 
worth of flying time before needing to re-fuel. Over the United States, where 
there are numerous airports and the flight legs were relatively short, fuel 
capacity was not an overriding concern. 
</P>
<P>
But over the North Atlantic -- where one leg consisted of 1,000 miles over 
water -- a five- to six-hour flight -- the pilots considered it essential that 
they maintain plenty of fuel. Aliengena had to worry less about fuel because he 
had modified his single-engine Cessna Centurion 210 to increase its flying 
range from 900 to 1,500 miles. Optimum range on the two twin-engine planes is 
about 1,400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
On the night before the crossing, Wiesner and Allyn calculated their respective 
weights and concluded that Allyn was 500 pounds overweight, while Wiesner was 
about 300 pounds over. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about here is margin of comfort," Wiesner said. "And I'm 
not comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Since most excess luggage had already been removed in Boston, Wiesner and Allyn 
decided that the only other way they could lighten their planes was to send 
some passengers commercially. A member of the film crew was flown to Oslo to 
await Tony, while Wiesner's wife and son were flown home to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was for Wiesner, who now had only three people in his plane, to take 
one of the six people Allyn had been ferrying. 
</P>
<P>
The carefully laid plans went awry, however, when Wiesner inadvertently left 
the Iqaluit Airport on Canada's Baffin Island without taking any of Allyn's 
passengers. Allyn did not notice until Sue Aliengena notified him on the runway 
that there were six life preservers for seven people. The seventh life 
preserver had been placed in Wiesner's Cessna in anticipation of an extra 
passenger there. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you were going to take five and me six," Allyn radioed to Wiesner as 
the two planes soared above an Arctic wasteland of glaciers and icebergs. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you could have asked someone to come my way," Wiesner responded, 
sounding slightly miffed. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, it's my fault," Allyn radioed, shaking his head in exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
The additional weight proved to be no problem on the 600-mile flight to 
Sondrestrom, Greenland. But during the next, 900-mile leg to Reykjavik, 
Iceland, Wiesner encountered a problem that had nothing to do with weight. And 
his handling of the problem again differentiated him from Aliengena and Allyn. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner was about an hour out of Sondrestrom -- cruising above Greenland's 
two-mile-thick icecap -- when his directional compass went out. He decided to 
turn back to Sondrestrom for fear of becoming lost over the open Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Both Aliengena and Allyn said that they would have pressed on, had the same 
problem happened to them because they could simply follow the other two planes. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner later said he wished that he had continued on because when he returned 
to the U.S. Air Force base at Sondrestrom, he was stuck there without a 
mechanic or fuel. He and his passengers, including three members of the film 
crew and Soviet journalist Alexei Grinevich, wound up stranded in Greenland 
until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After finally getting repairs and fuel, Wiesner turned around and headed for 
home, having fallen too far behind Tony to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Grinevich and the film crew members finally got seats on a commercial flight to 
Copenhagen, after remaining on a standby waiting list since Saturday for the 
only daily flight out. Wiesner paid for their tickets, saying he felt obliged 
to uphold his deal with Aliengena to ferry the film crew to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Later, both Allyn and Aliengena expressed sympathy and regret for what had 
happened to Wiesner. 
</P>
<P>
"For him, it was the right decision," Aliengena said of Wiesner's turning back. 
"I probably wouldn't have done that. But a pilot has to know his flying 
ability, and he's got to be comfortable flying with that."

COUNTY MEASLES CASES HIT HIGHEST LEVEL IN 11 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With more than six months left in 1989, Orange County's measles epidemic 
already has hit an 11-year high of 280 cases, more than double that of all of 
1988, county health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the county has not recorded any deaths from the highly contagious 
disease. "But if it keeps on like this, we'll see them," warned county 
epidemiologist Dr. Thomas J. Prendergast. 
</P>
<P>
The 280 cases reported so far this year were as of June 20. That compares to 
109 measles cases in all of last year and only 12 in 1987, according to 
statistics from the Orange County Health Care Agency. The last severe measles 
epidemics occurred in 1976 with 443 cases and in 1977 with 397 cases. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of this year's cases have involved Latino children who had never 
been vaccinated, and a quarter of those affected were adults, according to 
Prendergast. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the epidemic would slow when schools let out for the 
summer later this month but added that he wasn't counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is: one or two people can infect as many as 20 people. So we can't 
be confident it won't pick up again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prendergast blamed this year's outbreak on several factors. "A number of 
Hispanics were not immunized. Some were immunized, but the vaccine has a small 
failure rate," he said. "And a few people were immunized with something not as 
effective as the vaccine we use now. But the main problem is young Hispanics 
who were not immunized." 
</P>
<P>
Measles, also known as red measles or rubeola, is considered a highly 
infectious disease. Symptoms typically begin about 10 days after the virus 
enters the body and include fever, cough, watery eyes and sensitivity to light. 
</P>
<P>
A rash appears about four days after the first symptoms and lasts five to 10 
days. Complications of measles can include ear infections, bronchitis, 
pneumonia and, in rare cases, encephalitis. The illness is sometimes confused 
with rubella, or German measles, which also involves a rash but has less severe 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Around the country, 24 states including California have reported measles 
outbreaks this year, mostly affecting preschool children, according to the 
National Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Through June 11, there were 5,569 cases of measles, a 300% increase over the 
same period last year, CDC public health adviser Dean Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit have been children in the Los Angeles area, where eight have died 
from complications of measles. Also, nine children died in Houston, one in 
Illinois and one in Puerto Rico, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Although this year's measles epidemic is severe, still "it's minuscule to what 
it was in the pre-vaccine era," Mason noted. Before a measles vaccine was 
developed in 1963, typically more than 500,000 people contracted measles in an 
average year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless measles is still "a lousy, rotten disease," noted Dr. Adele 
Hofmann, director of the outpatient clinic at Childrens Hospital of Orange 
County in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
At least five children were admitted to CHOC with encephalitis that accompanied 
measles, CHOC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, so many youngsters with measles were coming to CHOC's clinic in 
April and May that "we were having our own epidemic in the waiting room," 
Hofmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be having, say, a kid who would be coming in for a burn treatment. 
And there'd be a kid who'd be coming in with measles, but who didn't have the 
rash yet. And he'd expose all the kids who were there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Problem 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center in Orange had the same problem in the waiting area for its 
emergency room, doctors there reported. Someone who seemed to have the flu or 
bronchitis would "come to our front desk and they'd expose a lot of people," 
said Dr. Michael Burns, an associate clinical professor of emergency medicine 
and infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
While Burns said he doesn't know for certain whether other patients caught 
measles in UCIMC's emergency room, two physicians and an emergency room 
technician did catch the disease there. 
</P>
<P>
"The docs got pretty sick, but that's typical of measles," Burns said. "You 
feel like you're going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard-hit by measles have been young Latinos, many of them from the 
Santa Ana area, local doctors say. Also, Hofmann said, Samoan children here 
seem to get especially ill from the measles. "They don't seem to have a 
mechanism for handling (it)," she said. "They're like American Indians, who 
were decimated by measles. We saw a number of Samoan children who were 
devastated by measles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Managed the Risk 
</P>
<P>
Both CHOC and UCIMC believe that they have managed the risk of contracting 
measles at their hospitals. At CHOC, the hospital has posted signs saying that 
any child with fever, cough, watery eyes and rash "must report to the nurse's 
station immediately" so he can be kept separate from other patients 
</P>
<P>
At UCIMC, emergency room personnel posted a sign in English and Spanish that 
says, "If you have a rash, do not enter. Please have someone contact the triage 
nurse." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, hospital officials sent out "an alert" barring any child under the 
age of 16 from visiting a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the hospital offered free measles vaccines to any employee under the age 
of 35 who had not been vaccinated since 1980, Patricia Hamm Hayden, UCIMC's 
infection control manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest tally of measles cases, officials at both CHOC and UCIMC 
said they believe that the epidemic may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
Hofmann said she has been seeing only three to four measles cases a week 
lately. In April and May, her clinic typically was seeing three to four in a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
At UCIMC, Burns said he had not seen any measles cases for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He'll Wait and See 
</P>
<P>
Prendergast said he was interested in those accounts but would wait to see 
whether the numbers "won't pick up again." 
</P>
<P>
CHOC's Hofmann had some advice for parents who might be wondering what to do 
about immunizing their child. "If your youngster is a year old and has not been 
immunized, the greatest service you can do is to take him to your physician or 
health department for immunization," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The risks of a measles, mumps or rubella shot are negligible. There's 
occasionally fever or a very transient rash, but it's the safest of all shots 
we have," she said, adding that the shots should give a child protection up to 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should also consider re-immunizing high school and college students, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS ON TREATING MEASLES 
</P>
<P>
When a child appears to have the measles, his or her fever should be managed, 
according to Adrienne Pederson, head nurse at the outpatient clinic for 
Childrens Hospital of Orange County. There are no drugs to combat measles once 
the disease strikes, she said. Here are some things parents should know: 
</P>
<P>
Control fever with a non-aspirin product. Fever could go as high as 103 and the 
child should be given liquids to help fight dehydration. Fever could last for 
several days and may be accompanied by vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
Before the rash appears, listen to make sure the cough that usually accompanies 
the disease in its first few days does not move to the chest area. If it does, 
that can result in pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Watch to make sure that children do not become listless or incoherent. Measles 
and its fever can result in encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Put children in bed and make them as comfortable as possible. If they complain 
about light hurting their eyes, the room should be darkened. 
</P>
<P>
Keep children away from other children after measles are suspected. Also, 
parents of other children who could have been infected with measles should be 
notified immediately.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COAST; 
</P>
<P>
BREAKERS UP TO 10 FEET INCREASE WATER RESCUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county coastline was hit with unusually high surf Thursday, so lifeguards 
were busy along the Southern California coast with an increased number of 
rescues. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported occasional breakers reaching 10 feet 
throughout the day and other waves commonly eight feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Swells and surf were expected to peak during the night. Meteorologists are not 
sure whether the high surf will return today or why surf was so high Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm betting on good surf for a couple of days," said Newport Beach lifeguard 
Rob Maier, who said the high waves could be gone today or linger for another 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
Maier said lifeguards in Newport Beach logged 110 rescues Thursday, about 80 
more than on a more typical day with surf two to three feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"There were big waves and a lot of rip" currents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maier said all the rescues were successful, with no injuries reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard and officials at major harbors in the county said no damage was 
reported from the high surf.

OFFICIALS ARE OPTIMISTIC COUNTY CAN AVOID $24-MILLION DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Administrative Office released its $2.9-billion proposed budget for 
fiscal 1989-90 on Thursday, showing a deficit of about $24 million -- enough to 
be threatening except that officials are "optimistic" that it will soon be 
erased. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature is considering giving a grant to county governments that would 
add about $19.7 million to Orange County's coffers, bringing the deficit into 
what officials consider a manageable range. The grant could be decided as early 
as next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my opinion that it is still too early to prognosticate doom," County 
Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said in a letter to the supervisors 
Thursday. "I prefer to concentrate our energy on . . . what we can do to 
present a balanced budget to your board." 
</P>
<P>
John Sibley, associate county administrative officer for the budget, said: 
"We're very optimistic that we're going to be able to manage this budget. If 
the $19 million doesn't come through, obviously we've got a significant 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 year begins on July 1 and the supervisors are scheduled to adopt 
the proposed budget on Wednesday. The county will hold hearings on the budget 
during the last week of July. Then the supervisors must give final approval by 
Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The awkward budget schedule -- with the hearings coming after the fiscal year 
begins -- is inherently difficult because much of the county's budget depends 
on decisions at the state level that are not made by June. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the $2.3-billion budget adopted by the supervisors had a deficit of 
$23 million that was not resolved until January when the Legislature passed the 
Trial Court Funding Act, a program in which the state assumed much of the cost 
to operate the county's court system. 
</P>
<P>
Before the county's budget was balanced, however, officials feared that the 
$23-million deficit could force the layoff of several hundred county employees. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said today's deficit could have the same ramifications, but "we haven't 
even started to look at that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish also said, "We have exercised restraint in communicating negative 
budget messages to agencies and departments in an effort to minimize the 
typical budget hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
But another potentially significant problem for the 1989-90 budget is the 
salary increases being negotiated with labor unions. The contracts for almost 
all of the county's 12,000 union employees will expire this year. Four of them 
end with the fiscal year next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish told the supervisors that there is no money in the budget for any 
salary increases and, if any are granted, the county's department heads might 
be forced to absorb the extra costs from their existing budgets. In that case, 
there could still be significant cuts in county staff or programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said a 1% salary increase for all county employees would cost the county 
about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Patton, the county's personnel director, said four county unions are 
negotiating their contracts now. One, the 600-member Service Employees 
International Union, was scheduled to vote on a contract Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The contract for the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs is scheduled to 
expire in November. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish began his letter to the supervisors on an upbeat tone, calling 
attention to the county's accomplishments in the past year even with its 
precarious budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We have maintained county programs in an era of fiscal restraint and at the 
same time, accomplished several significant tasks," Parrish wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He noted the county's progress in expanding John Wayne Airport as well as 
beginning construction at a new juvenile courthouse and an expanded branch jail 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"We have accomplished these tasks within the fiscal year 88-89 in spite of the 
paradox of decreasing revenues and increasing demands," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish then listed 11 areas for funding still needed in the county, including 
more jail beds, a new courthouse, office space for several county departments 
and more money for indigent medical services. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure you will agree that the needs far outdistance our financing 
abilities," he said.

INDICTMENT CLAIMS 7 SMUGGLED ALIENS, HELD THEM FOR RANSOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven people, four of them illegal aliens, have been indicted on charges of 
smuggling aliens across the U.S.-Mexican border and holding them in a Santa Ana 
home until relatives could pay for their release. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Martinez-Lopez, 27, a permanent resident, and his wife, Rosalva 
Padilla-Barajas, 25, an amnesty applicant, owned the home at 1346 S. Olive St. 
from which the smuggling operation allegedly operated, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Although 10 people were arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
on June 4, according to Tom Gaines, an INS assistant director in Los Angeles, 
only seven were indicted Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Also indicted were Enrique Arroyo-Arroyo, 42, a permanent resident who 
apparently took charge of the operation, and four illegal aliens: Carlos 
Godinez-Rodriquez, 37; Benjamin Martinez-Torres, 32; Carolos Gonzalez-Diaz, 41; 
and Maria Ramirez-Valdez, 36. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects will be arraigned Monday in federal court, said Grace Denton, a 
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. They each face a 
maximum of 15 years in prison and $500,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
According to Denton, court records show that immigrants from Mexico, Honduras, 
El Salvador and Guatemala were smuggled across the border at Tijuana and 
eventually brought by car to Orange County, where they waited at the 'drop-off' 
home at Olive Street and Borchard Avenue for relatives to pay hundreds of 
dollars for their release. 
</P>
<P>
The operation is fairly common, Gaines said. The INS had been working to break 
the ring "for some period of time," he said. "There are still those who want to 
come to the U.S. and those who want to deal with humanity like it's on the 
trading block." 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people were found in the 2,000-square-foot home when it was 
searched, Gaines said. "It's one of the nicest drop-off houses I've ever been 
in," he said.

PASTOR ENVISIONS SELF-SUSTAINING CO-OP BRINGING BARGAIN GROCERIES TO THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pastor Daniel de Leon can see it now. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of shoppers every hour, thousands every year, wheeling grocery carts 
full of inexpensive, high-quality food from a sparkling assembly line at Templo 
Calvario, his bilingual Pentecostal church in Santa Ana. In return, they 
promise to pay what they can and help out at the church warehouse. In time, the 
program would pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
It is a plan, he believes, to teach fishing, rather than give away fish, and a 
way of making the church truly helpful to everyone in the community, not just 
the needy. And perhaps, incidentally, it would be a way of expanding the 
3,500-member Templo Calvario, already one of the largest Latino churches in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, De Leon's vision already has begun to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Food Plus, a sort of Christian cooperative, has been under way since February 
in a converted warehouse in Templo Calvario's wood-shingled complex in a 
business park at the western end of Santa Ana. But De Leon expects membership 
to increase rapidly on Saturday with the official grand opening of the pilot 
program spearheaded by the Christian Broadcasting Network based in Virginia 
Beach, Va. 
</P>
<P>
CBN's founder, TV preacher-politician Pat Robertson, will attend the 9 a.m. 
ceremonies, which will be taped to be shown in July on his "700 Club" program. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson called the event "a highlight" of his "strictly religious and 
humanitarian" four-day visit to the Southland, where he plans to meet with CBN 
supporters. CBN crews will also be taping three live shows of the "700 Club" 
and four of another CBN program, "Straight Talk," from Long Beach on Wednesday 
through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful program," Robertson said of Food Plus. "That is a very 
exciting part of our operation." 
</P>
<P>
Food Plus is one of a handful of Orange County food cooperatives that buy food 
in bulk and generally require recipients to pay a small amount for food and to 
donate their service. There are also two large food banks in Orange County, in 
Orange and Santa Ana, which distribute surplus food through more than 200 local 
agencies to an estimated 120,000 county residents. 
</P>
<P>
At Food Plus, groceries are purchased wholesale by George Haddad, a member of 
the Costa Mesa-based Full Gospel Businessmen's Assn. They are packaged into 
"units" of four bags each, offering a balanced selection of meat, produce, 
grain and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $15, if they can, for a "unit" that would cost about $35 retail, De 
Leon said. They may purchase an unlimited number of units, which are picked up 
from an assembly-line conveyor belt in the spotless red-and-white warehouse. 
Food distribution is now being held every other Saturday, but that may be 
increased to weekly in September, De Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
Although intended to help the needy maintain their self-esteem while making 
ends meet, the program is open to anyone, needy or not, De Leon said. "The 
church is accused of taking people's money, bringing them in and making them a 
holy Joe," he said, adding, "The church needs to be a blessing to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
To become a member of what is essentially a food co-op, people must register at 
one of eight participating evangelical churches, including Templo Calvario. 
They are: the Anaheim Christian Center (Centro Cristiano de Anaheim); Nueva 
Jerusalem in Garden Grove; Open Door (La Puerta Abierta) in Costa Mesa; Hyde 
Park Church of God in Los Angeles; Upper Room in Westminster; Templo Emanuel in 
Santa Ana, and Iglesia Nueva Vida in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Information about the program is available by calling (714) 836-9379. 
</P>
<P>
People are asked to pay a $15 annual membership fee, and prepay $15 for the 
packed unit of groceries. They receive a voucher for each unit, which can be 
redeemed on regularly scheduled shopping days at the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers are asked to fill out a membership application, and their names are 
entered into a computer, then they receive a membership card. No one is turned 
away, De Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone must pay something, but those who cannot afford $15 may qualify for a 
subsidy, financed by a scholarship fund established by LaDoris McClaney of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All are asked to volunteer at least one hour of work at the warehouse, De Leon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seed money for the program has been contributed by CBN; World Vision, an 
international Christian relief agency based in Monrovia; and the Food Industry 
Crusade Against Hunger, a fund-raising program of several grocery chains. But 
the program is expected to become self-sufficient with 3,000 regular members, 
De Leon said. So far, 1,000 -- including himself -- have signed up, mostly from 
Templo Calvario, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About half have returned to volunteer, De Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not really pushed that hard because the numbers have not required it," 
he said. "But we've already shifted gears. Now, when people come in to pay and 
pick up the food, the volunteer coordinator says, 'We have a schedule here. 
When are you going to help?' " 
</P>
<P>
One reason CBN selected Templo Calvario for its pilot project is that the 
growing church had the necessary 10,000 square feet of warehouse space and 
equipment, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Templo Calvario, which is affiliated with the Assemblies of God, has grown from 
a membership of 100 to 3,500 in the 12 years since De Leon became pastor. The 
church has 40 branches, mostly in Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The church is in a 60,000-square-foot complex at 2617 W. 5th St., a few blocks 
from some of Santa Ana's poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Community involvement has been a keystone of the church and is one reason it 
has attracted members, De Leon said. Most members of the local congregation are 
second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans, and about 60% are bilingual. 
While many earn the minimum wage, few are on welfare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some are also needy, Spanish-speaking immigrants who are attracted to 
whichever church is there to help them, said De Leon, a graduate of Southern 
California College, an Assemblies of God school in Costa Mesa, and Melodyland 
School of Theology in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A Catholic family, for example, joined Templo Calvario after participating in 
the food distribution program, De Leon said. He said he has no doubts the 
program will attract more members. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic authorities have accused Protestant evangelicals of proselytizing 
Latinos, who are predominantly Catholic, but according to De Leon: "They are 
pretty much coming on their own." 
</P>
<P>
De Leon said he is discussing with CBN the possibility of adding 
Spanish-to-English "literacy packs" to Food Plus. An additional program would 
help adults obtain high school equivalency certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other food programs that come to an end with the money available for 
them, Food Plus aims to become a self-sustaining "renewable feeding project," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOOD PROGRAMS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Food Banks 
</P>
<P>
They distribute donated food to community food programs run by soup kitchens, 
churches, etc. They include: 
</P>
<P>
Food Distribution Center. Affiliated with St. Vincent de Paul Society and 
located in Orange, it distributes about 500,000 pounds of surplus supermarket 
food each month through 223 local agencies to 120,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Council in Santa Ana. Serves about 11,000 people a month. 
</P>
<P>
Food Co-Op Programs 
</P>
<P>
Members or participants pay reduced price for food bags, usually in return for 
some sort of community service requirement. They include: 
</P>
<P>
Food Plus. Affiliated with Assemblies of God churches, participants pay $15 
annual membership, plus $15 for food packages, and are asked to volunteer at 
least one hour working at program's warehouse at Templo Calvario in Santa Ana. 
About 1,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Share. A nationwide program based in San Diego with an outlet in Tustin, it 
distributes 150 food packages a month, serving about 600 people. Participants 
pay $12 for each package and are asked to contribute two or more hours of 
community service a month. 
</P>
<P>
Mealdeal. Run through the Community Development Council in Santa Ana, the 
program distributes food bags to centers throughout the county, where they in 
turn are distributed to participants. People pay $6 per bag, which goes to CDC. 
No community service requirement. Program distributes about 100 bags a week to 
about 300 participants. 
</P>
<P>
Deseret storehouse. Run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the 
warehouse in Fountain Valley fills about 3,000 orders annually, mainly for 
church members.

ROBINSON GUESSES RIGHT: TRABER DELIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
ORIOLE'S PINCH-HIT HOME RUN RUINS FRASER'S OUTING AND SINKS ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Traber, bat in hand, was sitting at the end of the Baltimore Orioles' bench 
Thursday evening when Manager Frank Robinson motioned for him to pinch-hit. A 
dramatic moment, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I stared at Frank, he stared back; I got ready to hit," Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
But as corny as it might sound, Robinson later said he had "a feeling" that 
Traber would do something special as the Orioles tried to untie a 5-5 score in 
the top of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Cornier still is that Robinson was right. 
</P>
<P>
Traber made his way to the plate, where he would face Angel reliever Willie 
Fraser, the same guy he had beaten earlier this season with a bases-loaded 
sacrifice fly. But this time Fraser was cruising, retiring 10 of the first 11 
Orioles he faced. 
</P>
<P>
The count grew to 3-2 when Fraser decided on a fastball inside. This much he 
knew: He didn't want to walk Traber, thus, putting the winning run on base. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Traber jerked Fraser's pitch into the right-field seats, some 390 feet 
away from home plate. It departed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit it, I knew it was out," Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
So did Fraser, who could only watch a perfectly fine 3 2/3-inning relief 
appearance ruined by a single swing. And all because Robinson had a 
premonition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a feeling putting Traber in," Robinson said. "I had an idea that 
Traber would get one." 
</P>
<P>
This is the sort of slump the Angels are in these days: Robinson guesses 
correctly, Fraser guesses incorrectly. Robinson points to someone who had spent 
the night on the bench and that someone delivers. Meanwhile, the Angels, now 
losers of 11 of their last 14 games, can't seem to catch a break, to say 
nothing of Traber's blast. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything (Robinson) has done this year has been done right," Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said of Fraser, who has struggled with inconsistency and the 
idea of becoming a full-time bullpen resident this season. But Thursday night 
was different. This time, Fraser threw as if he didn't have a worry in the 
world. The Orioles? One, two, three in the fifth. One, two, three in the sixth. 
One, two, a single, three in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the eighth inning and, of course, Traber. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what I wanted to do with him," Fraser said. "I was trying to get the 
ball in on him, but I just didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Said Traber: "He's throwing a lot harder this year coming out of the pen than 
as a starter. But he was in a tough situation. I know he didn't want to walk 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser didn't quite know how to assess the 6-5 Angel loss. He had done well in 
relief of starter Jim Abbott, but he had also made one glaring error in 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Also to be remembered is Traber's recent hitting streak. Until Monday, he had 
hit safely in 13 consecutive games. In the last 16 games, Traber has driven in 
16 runs and raised his average 76 points. No slouch is he. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I threw the ball good," Fraser said. "You take that one pitch away and 
it's a great outing." 
</P>
<P>
Keep that one pitch and it's still a performance to proud of, said fellow Angel 
reliever Greg Minton, himself a victim of a game-winning homer not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for Fraser," he said. "That might have been his best outing of 
the year. He's looking to get over a hump, too. Seems like a lot of guys are 
looking to get over a hump right now. (We) didn't quite make it."

<P>
About 600 competitors are expected to start the fourth Huntington Beach 
triathlon, which will begin near the Huntington Beach Pier at 7 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio DeSoto of San Diego, who finished second in the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center triathlon June 4 at Mission Viejo, is scheduled to compete in the 
$6,500 Huntington Beach race. Among those expected to challenge DeSoto are Doug 
Roberts, also of San Diego, who finished fifth in the Memphis triathlon; Rob 
Bistodeau of Del Mar; Mike Fillipow of Huntington Beach, and Australian Mark 
Pringle, who will be competing in the United States for the first time.

<P>
Brad Kearns of Malibu, who won the event last year, will be unable to compete 
because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a tremendous amount of calls from those wanting to compete in the 
event," race director Jack Caress said. "We're already 100 ahead of last year's 
pace." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Vallance, a Santa Barbara resident who won the Human Race triathlon last 
October at Newport Beach, is among the favorites in the women's competition, 
along with Karen Chequer-Pfeiffer of Alta Loma and Shannon Delaney of San 
Diego. Kim Kucera of Huntington Beach also will compete. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which starts with a one-kilometer (approximately five-eighths of a 
mile) swim around the pier, also includes a 30-kilometer bike race (about 18 
miles) along the bluffs of Bolsa Chica State Park and an eight-kilometer run 
(nearly five miles) along the Huntington Beach boardwalk. The run -- and 
triathlon -- will end in a parking lot adjacent to the pier. 
</P>
<P>
The winners in the men's and women's competitions will receive $1,500 each. The 
second-place finishers will each receive $750 and third place is worth $500. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the final day of sign-ups, which will take place at the Huntington 
Beach Inn from 5 to 9 p.m. The entry fee is $45. AL PRESTON

AREA FOOTBALL PLAYERS RECEIVE INVITATIONS TO ARENA TRAINING CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three former Orange County college football players were among 99 players 
invited to Arena Football's league-wide training camp, the league announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Allen and Quinton Knight, formerly of Cal State Fullerton, were assigned 
to the Denver Dynamite. Tony Palamara, who played at Saddleback College, was 
assigned to the Maryland Commandos. 
</P>
<P>
All three played Arena Football last year for teams that were not included in 
the league's 1989 plans. Allen, a wide receiver/defensive back, was with the 
New England Steamrollers; Knight, a lineman, was with the New York Knights, and 
Palamara, also a lineman, was with the L.A. Cobras.

<P>
General Electric and Ford have entered into an agreement to develop a new line 
of automotive lights using arc discharge systems to replace halogen filament 
lights in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
GE's Lighting Group announced Thursday an agreement for the joint project with 
Ford's Diversified Products Operations division. 
</P>
<P>
GE Lighting, the leading supplier of lights for domestic auto makers and No. 2 
worldwide behind Phillips, estimates the world market for the new lighting 
system could be $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Arc discharge technology uses an electronically controlled arc, or spark, 
created between two electrodes as the light source, instead of today's halogen 
filament.

GUITARIST LAGRENE STRUMS TO HIS OWN BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not unusual for teen-agers to have identity problems. But consider the 
case of Bireli Lagrene, a French guitarist who, while in his early teens, 
startled the jazz world with his uncanny re-creations of the music of Gypsy 
guitarist Django Reinhardt, who died in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was 16, Lagrene -- who will play acoustic sets alone and together 
with Al Di Meola and Larry Coryell tonight at the Coach House -- was in danger 
of being permanently cast as a Django imitator. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard time making my own personality," Lagrene, now 22, said in a 
recent phone conversation during his current tour. "When I was a kid, I played 
what I liked, and I liked Django. I learned all of his songs and all of his 
solos. But when I was around 15 or 16, I thought, well, I have to do something 
else. People came to my shows not to see me but to see a person represent 
Django's music. I didn't feel very comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
Lagrene (a full-blood Gypsy himself) began to look for his own directions. "I 
started composing more, and I discovered the big world of electronics." He took 
a big step toward becoming his own man in 1987 with the release of "Inferno" 
(Blue Note), a rocking collection of electric numbers with titles like "Action" 
and "Hips." One Lagrene original from the album, "Rock It," with its solid 
back-beat and screaming guitar lines, seemed like a declaration of independence 
for the youthful star, almost an overstatement of his new direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been playing this soft, cool music, very jazzy, and I told myself that I 
wanted to do a tune that really rocks out," he said. The critics, used to his 
flowing acoustic treatment of "Sweet Georgia Brown" and others from the 
Reinhardt bag, condemned the new direction. 
</P>
<P>
But Lagrene hadn't broken entirely away from his early idol. Also on the album, 
he played an electric version of "Incertitude" by Babik Reinhardt, Django's 
son, with all the rolling agility and Gypsy inflection that gained him 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Does he still play Reinhardt's numbers today? "Almost none," he said. "I'm 
still listening to him, though. My point in listening to other musicians is to 
see what's happening. I don't really have a big influence at this time. I 
listen to all those guys, (John) Scofield, (Mike) Stern, and know them 
personally. But I would never keep my own style if I listened to too many 
guitarists. I'd pick up too much of their style and would start to sound like 
Stern and those guys." 
</P>
<P>
Lagrene's latest album, "Foreign Affairs" (also on Blue Note), makes a break 
with the past, but not quite as self-consciously. From the cool musings of 
"Timothee," a tune named for Lagrene's 18-month-old son on which he plays 
electric bass, to Herbie Hancock's "Jack Rabbit," the album displays a variety 
of contexts and tempos. The most apparent is that of Joe Zawinul and Weather 
Report, whose sound is faithfully vamped on a Lagrene original called "Josef." 
</P>
<P>
One thread that connects both albums to Lagrene's earlier days is his "Rue de 
Pierre," versions of which appear on both albums (the song is named after the 
street he was born on; Pierre is also the name he was given at birth). The 
unaccompanied acoustic renditions, though little resembling each other, 
demonstrate the young guitarist's agility and wit and are a good indication of 
what fans will hear tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Lagrene, who lives outside Strasbourg, France, is anxious to return to this 
country with his current band; keyboardist Koono (who Lagrene says is part 
Gypsy), bassist Jurgen Attig and drummer Allen Nau. All but Nau play on 
"Foreign Affairs." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to concentrate on this band," Lagrene said, "and not switch musicians. 
I want people to recognize my music and my musicians, now that I've got great 
personalities in the band." 
</P>
<P>
Has he finally shaken the perception that he's a Django clone? "Those last two 
records really helped. In Europe, people already know I play my own music. In 
America, they've been slow to find out. That's why I want to come back with my 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 Bireli Lagrene, Al Di Meola and Larry Coryell play tonight at 8 and 10:30 at 
the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $17.50. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

BUFFETT'S MUSIC STUCK AT LOW TIDE AS FANS WALLOW IN 'MARGARITAVILLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's a tip: Next time Jimmy Buffett comes to town, buy stock in garish 
tropical print shirts. 
</P>
<P>
That was -- along with caps sporting shark fins -- definitely the fashion 
statement Tuesday as Buffett (pop's foremost nautical nabob) and his Coral 
Reefer Band played the first of two nights at the Universal Amphitheatre. (The 
crew also docks at the Pacific Amphitheatre for shows tonight and Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
Would that Buffett's music was as colorful (if tacky) as his fans' choice in 
attire. Instead, Monday's offerings had the general hue and consistency of a 
pina colada, spiked only by the fluid harmonica of his longtime partner Fingers 
Taylor and the mild Caribbean flavoring of a steel drum. In nautical terms, 
Sailor Jimmy is in a dead calm. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is he drifting aimlessly, but that seems to be the central theme of 
his canon. What's more, he seems to think drifting is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
And drift he does, through a world in which the ideal love is a "Mermaid in the 
Night" (a song from his new "Off to See the Lizard" album) and his biggest 
concern is that he still can't find that dang shaker of salt in 
"Margaritaville." Well, Jim, if you just got up and looked you might be able to 
track the thing down! 
</P>
<P>
"Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes," he sang. "Nothing remains quite 
the same." Except him, that is. Well, OK, he did shave off his mustache last 
year. But otherwise, his mix of old and new material showed little difference 
between Buffett past and Buffett present. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the audience made the show seem like a rowdy frat party, singing along on 
nearly every song (often voicing the words ahead of Buffett, as the star 
pointed out with mock irritation). "Some of you people obviously don't give a 
damn about working on Wednesday," the singer noted, to the delight of the 
boisterous crowd. 
</P>
<P>
What was all the shouting about? Apparently these people find Buffett's gift 
for clever (though hardly insightful) turns of phrase and the notion of 
floating in the Tropics something to get excited about. But then, this paradox 
almost makes sense: It's just the kind of go-figure occurrence that Buffett 
likes to write about. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yeah -- if you do invest in those shirts, make sure a good number of them 
have room for beer bellies. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever musical breeze did fill the sails on Tuesday could likely be credited 
to opening act the Neville Brothers. Drawing largely from its fine recent 
"Yellow Moon" album, the New Orleans institution's polyrhythmic Mardi Gras 
mambo got the crowd quite fired up. Most impressive was how the Nevilles got 
the predominantly white audience to sing and clap along on its tribute to 
civil-rights movement spark Rosa Parks, perhaps even connecting with the idea 
that "our freedom fight" was as important to Caucasians as to 
African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Buffett and the Neville Brothers perform today and Saturday at 8 p.m. 
the Pacific Amphitheatre, 100 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $16.50 to 
$22.50. Information: (714) 634-1300.

RHYTHM STARS USE POWER ROCK FOR ANIMAL THRILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two heavyweight-class musicians such as Stewart Copeland and Stanley Clarke 
can't form a band without creating heavy expectations and maybe even making 
themselves targets for that dreaded tag, supergroup. 
</P>
<P>
But Copeland, lauded as one of rock's finest drummers since his days with the 
Police, and Clarke, hailed as a versatile and virtuosic bassist since helping 
to pioneer the fusion of jazz, rock and funk during the 1970s, came up with a 
refreshing response to weighty expectations Wednesday night when they brought 
their new band, Animal Logic, to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians don't parade pedigrees, this dynamic rhythm duo seemed to be saying. 
They just play, and the goal of playing is enjoyment. In front of a delighted, 
full-house audience, Clarke and Copeland shared the animal enjoyment of 
hard-driving power rock, tempered by a sense of atmosphere and musical 
architecture that calls for some brain work too. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland and Clarke had fun together from the very start of the 80-minute set. 
They squared off face to face, shared grins and took off on a rumbling, rolling 
charge that conjured up memories of the Who in full flight -- better memories, 
perhaps, than the Who itself will conjure on its summer gravy run. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when a duet instrumental climaxed with a speeding crescendo, the 
erudite-looking Clarke raised his hands from his bass, threw back his head and 
enjoyed a deep laugh. These bracing games of rhythm tag and follow the leader 
were the order of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Michael Thompson kept pace with screaming, 
two-hands-on-the-guitar-neck leads that rose above the standard post-Eddie Van 
Halen noisemaking. In more restrained passages, Thompson, a session player who 
recently released an album on Geffen Records with his own Michael Thompson 
Band, complemented the activist rhythm section with spare harmonics and deft 
shadings that recalled Andy Summers' classy sound-colorings with the Police. 
</P>
<P>
While Copeland and Clarke, augmented by Thompson, blew away any nettlesome 
questions of living up to expectations, a far less heralded vocalist grappled 
uneasily with a more difficult problem: How does an unknown singer establish an 
identity while keeping company with renowned instrumentalists? 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Holland, a Copeland discovery, would seem to have an advantage in 
staking out turf of her own: She writes Animal Logic's songs. But most of the 
material -- all new, except for a blues encore, "Love Me Like a Man" -- was 
competent but unremarkable rock with anthem-like choruses aimed at the heart of 
the commercial mainstream (Animal Logic just put out its debut album in Europe, 
with a U.S. release expected on an as-yet-undetermined label). 
</P>
<P>
One song stood out on first hearing: "Elijah," in which Holland built from 
moody passages to impressive keening that conveyed a sense of mystery and 
longing. But most of the time, for all the heat of her all-out belting and 
sustained vocal glides, Holland sounded arid, like the Santa Ana winds she sang 
about in one song. 
</P>
<P>
She may have been concentrating too much on technique, at the expense of 
unveiling personality and letting feelings fly free. If seasoning brings the 
singer into better balance with the players, Animal Logic should really make

ANN CONWAY: GUESTS MAY HEAR A SENATORIAL DUET

Will they or won't they? That's the question that supporters of Sen. Pete 
Wilson for governor are asking. Will Pete and Gayle Wilson sing at William and 
Willa Dean Lyon's Saturday night the way they sang at Jim and Nancy Baldwin's 
last October? 
</P>
<P>
There's no mention of it on the party invitations, fancy little numbers that 
ask guests to come to Coto de Caza for "The Orange County Premiere Dinner 
Honoring Our Next Governor of California." But there was no mention of it on 
the invitations to the Baldwin bash in Emerald Bay either. 
</P>
<P>
"They were kind of forced into it at the Baldwins," says an insider. "They both 
looked a little embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
But they sounded terrific. "They have beautiful voices," remembers one guest. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk it up to the buzz about the Wilsons being multi-talented, or chalk it up 
to folks not wanting to miss a summer splash at the Lyons, but a whopping 400 
Wilsonites have sent in $1,000 each to participate in the fund-raiser. 
Wonderful news for campaign organizers. Terrifying news, at first, for 
Hemingway's, caterer of the alfresco affair. 
</P>
<P>
When the Corona del Mar restaurant, which has gained a reputation as the 
county's power caterer (they whipped up that lunch for the Reagans when they 
dined at the Lyons last year), started party plans, 250 guests were expected. 
"But then the party grew," said Randy Johnson, owner of Hemingway's. "And so 
did logistical problems. Suddenly, instead of figuring out how to accommodate 
125 couples, you're figuring out how to accommodate 200. How many homes can 
accommodate 200 cars? How many homes can handle 400 guests for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Johnson, who lives by a credo of "impeccable service," decided to 
redesign the party to fit the grounds of the Lyons' lush estate. Instead of the 
dinner that had been planned for 250 around the pool, the pool will be used for 
a cocktail reception. Dinner, which will feature range chicken with Chardonnay 
sauce and lemon custard in chocolate shells, will be served in the area between 
the Lyons' Tara-esque manse and the museum that houses the retired Air Force 
general's fleet of antique automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Cole and the Sounds of Music will play for dancing. And, if guests get 
lucky, the Wilsons will do one of their impromptu duets. With a breathtaking 
$400,000 from Orange County in the senator's gubernatorial campaign coffers, 
how could they resist? 
</P>
<P>
Our Fair Couple: Mum has always been the word when John and Donna Crean of 
Newport Beach donate megabucks to underwrite operatic productions at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. They have simply been more comfortable giving 
anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
But tonight, after "My Fair Lady" opens at the Center, the Creans will show up 
at a Center Club party and nobody will have to pretend. The word is officially 
out: The Creans donated $100,000 to bring the Lerner &amp; Loewe classic to 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"We've decided to let Opera Pacific tell people about us because we hope it 
gets others to underwrite. Opera Pacific needs underwriters," Donna said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"My Fair Lady" is the couple's favorite musical. "We love the whole thing -- 
the story, the music. . . . " Their favorite song is "I'm an Ordinary Man," 
Donna said, because of the sentiments expressed in the lyrics. "That song 
always makes us laugh. I say: 'I know why women don't think like men! Because 
they don't want to. Because men don't think!' " (Spoken like a true Eliza 
Doolittle.) 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the gadabout Creans (if they're not attending every A-party in 
town, they're attending every A-party uptown), the couple were at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire last Thursday to receive an award from the American Parkinson 
Disease Assn. At their table: Lynn Redgrave; Alex Trebek of television's 
"Jeopardy"; Jane Withers and Ruta Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the honor bestowed upon the Creans, the highlight of the affair was 
seeing Richard Blackwell, author of the infamous "worst-dressed" list, being 
roasted by some of the women he has blasted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
While the fashion arbiter stood on stage, "looking like a stuffed dummy," he 
said, everyone "razzed me." 
</P>
<P>
"But really, I think it turned out to be a tribute, which proves they just 
lovvvvved making the list!" 
</P>
<P>
Being bookish by the bay: It has become the thing to do for the ladies who 
lunch -- attend the Balboa Bay Club's Round Table West Books and Authors 
programs. On Thursday, a few hundred locals will hear author Judith Quine talk 
about "The Bridesmaids," her story of Grace Kelly and the six friends (Quine 
among them) who served as her wedding attendants when she became Princess of 
Monaco. "There's an enormous interest in Grace, especially by younger women," 
Quine said recently from her suite at the St. Regis hotel in Detroit, a pit 
stop on her current book tour. "There are a lot of things that Grace had to do 
that young women are finding they have to do. For example, balance that 
superwoman act while trying to find some time for intimacy in their lives."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: FOR THE YOUNG, A VIETNAM WAR HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
American combat troops had already left Vietnam by the time Joseph Anzenberger 
Jr. entered the Marine Corps right out of high school in 1974, but the Rancho 
Santa Margarita resident is now hip deep in the quagmire of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Figuratively speaking, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Anzenberger signed a contract with Facts on File in January to write a history 
of the war. Due to be published in 1990, Anzenberger's tentatively titled "The 
Vietnam War" will be part of the New York publisher's Library in a Book series. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is really aimed at high school and college students who are 
researching the war or want to learn more about it," said Anzenberger, 34, a 
systems analyst for Northrop Corp. in Pico Rivera, who writes in his spare 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The book will be broken into two sections -- the first a concise overview of 
the Vietnam War, from 1945 to 1975, the second an annotated reference section 
that will direct researchers to further information about the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people would go to libraries or dig up the periodicals," Anzenberger 
said. "I list all the other organizations where they can find information about 
the war, the lesser-known research places. There is, for example, a theses 
center in Ann Arbor, Mich. -- University Microfilm International -- which is a 
clearinghouse for masters' and doctoral theses throughout the country. It has a 
big collection on the Vietnam War. All the organizations that were in Vietnam, 
such as the Red Cross and USO, also have official histories." 
</P>
<P>
Anzenberger's current project, for which he received a $4,000 advance, is 
actually his second book dealing with the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The first, published in 1986, is "Combat Art of the Vietnam War" (McFarland), a 
collection of drawings and paintings done during the war with accompanying text 
that relates several of the combat artists' stories. 
</P>
<P>
Anzenberger got the idea for the book in the early '80s while majoring in 
literature at Pace University in Pleasantville, N.Y. He read James Jones' "WW 
II" (a nonfiction book in which the novelist provided a soldier's-eye view of 
World War II accompanied by combat art), and checked to see if a similar book 
had been done on the Vietnam War. He found that no such book had been done. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, a lot of people viewed the Vietnam War through photographs 
and this artwork was a way of looking at a different aspect," he said. "An 
artist has more time to think the picture out and can take a little more 
license with the scene" than a combat photographer. 
</P>
<P>
In beginning his research, Anzenberger discovered that the different branches 
of the military had collected 10,000 pieces of art rendered during the Vietnam 
War. About 95% of the artwork had been officially commissioned by the military, 
he said, while "the other 5% was done by standard military people who donated 
their work" during and after the war. 
</P>
<P>
In doing the combat art book, he also wanted to learn more about a war to which 
he had not paid much attention while growing up. "It was a learning experience 
for myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His upcoming book, he said, is aimed at the college and high school students of 
today "whose parents may have fought in the war but who may be turned off by 
some of the more in-depth books that are out about the Vietnam War. This book 
is meant to bring it down to a more readable level." 
</P>
<P>
In selling his idea for a Vietnam history book to Facts On File in January, 
Anzenberger did the same thing he did with the first book: He wrote a detailed 
outline, with sample writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't used an agent on either" book, he said, adding that he is learning 
all the "ins and outs" of the publishing world on his own. "My first contract 
was three pages long. The Facts on File contract is 15 pages, so I kind of 
learned to get through that." 
</P>
<P>
Anzenberger, who began doing research for the new book last August, must 
deliver his completed manuscript next January. 
</P>
<P>
He spends an average of six or seven hours a week writing at night after his 
two children are in bed and spends three or four hours on Saturdays doing 
research at the UC Irvine library which, he said, has "a tremendous amount of 
information" on Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
For someone holding down a full-time job, Anzenberger said, writing a book "is 
a matter of time management, really." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as finding time, one of the tricks I have is I bought a laptop 
computer," he said. "It saves a lot of time. I just take it directly to the 
library with me," thus eliminating taking notes by hand and then having to 
transfer the notes to a computer. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also sets "milestones" for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was develop a database of the war -- all the dates 
between 1945 and 1975 -- anything I thought was substantial or significant. I'm 
using that as a checklist and guide to see how much further I've got to go and 
what I've covered. I've broken it up into various eras and set myself dates of 
when I should really be at what point, so I'll finish this on time." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the hardest thing is staying motivated," he added. "It's so easy to 
say, 'I'll do it tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
A former reporter for a weekly newspaper in Haverstraw, N.Y., and a stringer 
for Gannett Newspapers, Anzenberger has also worked as a technical writer. And 
he has tried his hand at fiction: He submitted a script he wrote on speculation 
for television's "Tour of Duty" ("it didn't go anywhere") and has written a 
children's book which, he says, "has been rejected 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his nonfiction background, he sees fiction as something he would like 
to eventually focus on. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I guess I just don't have the confidence factor to approach 
fiction," he said. "I'd feel more confident having a few nonfiction books under 
my belt. I personally need to feel the confidence that I can be published, 
which I'm gaining through the nonfiction." 
</P>

SUSPECT SEIZED IN SHOOTING SPREE AT RESTAURANT IN UNIVERSAL CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who was asked to leave a Universal City restaurant after an argument in a 
bar returned and fired several shots at security guards and about 100 other 
patrons this morning but no one was injured, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Charles Bryant, 31, of Studio City, was then chased 
by the security guards and captured after the 1:30 a.m. shooting in front of 
the Victoria Station restaurant. He was arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder and was being held without bail in the sheriff's West Hollywood 
substation jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Roger Hom said Bryant had been in the bar of the restaurant, located in 
the entertainment and studio complex off Lankershim Boulevard. Bryant got into 
an argument with another patron and was asked by the restaurant manager to 
leave, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant returned as the restaurant was closing and patrons were leaving. Hom 
said the suspect fired two shots from a semi-automatic pistol at two unarmed 
security guards and then turned and fired at least nine more shots at the 
patrons leaving the restaurant. Hom did not know how far away from the people 
Bryant stood when shooting. "Miraculously, none of the scattering patrons were 
hit by the gunfire," he said.

HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN FEDERAL DIAL-A-PORN BAN; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM OF SPEECH CITED IN 9-0 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court today struck down part of a federal law banning all sexually 
explicit telephone message services on the ground that the dial-a-porn measure 
went too far in restricting free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
The year-old law designed to shield minors from pornography banned any "obscene 
or indecent communication for commercial purposes" over interstate telephone 
lines at any time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The high court voted 9 to 0 in ruling that indecent, sexually explicit messages 
enjoyed constitutional free-speech protections and could not be banned, but at 
the same time ruled by a 6-3 vote that obscene calls could be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Remain in Business 
</P>
<P>
Since the law had called for a total ban, the ruling means the dial-a-porn 
industry -- which started in 1983 and generates an estimated $2 billion a year 
-- can remain in business. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 1988 law's total ban was never imposed because U.S. District Judge 
A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles ruled it could be applied only to obscene -- 
not merely indecent -- phone messages. 
</P>
<P>
Sable Communications, a California-based dial-a-porn company, had challenged 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in its opinion, and Congress when it passed the law, did not 
define what constituted indecent or obscene telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
Callers of the dial-a-porn numbers hear a short taped, or sometimes a live, 
sexually explicit message at a cost of several dollars a call. 
</P>
<P>
The decision represented the second controversial high court ruling this week 
that pitted an emotionally charged social issue against the freedom of speech 
protections under the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flag Ruling 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the conviction of a political 
protester for burning the American flag during the 1984 Republican convention, 
saying such activity was protected by the Constitution. The decision sparked a 
storm of protest in Congress and criticism from President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The pornography law, which had been strongly supported by the Reagan and Bush 
Administrations, provides for up to two years in prison and $500,000 in fines 
for obscene messages and six months in prison and $50,000 in fines for indecent 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
"The ban on indecent telephone messages violates the First Amendment since the 
law's denial of adult access to such messages far exceeds that which is 
necessary to serve the compelling interest of preventing minors from being 
exposed to the messages," Justice Byron R. White wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fail-Safe Method' 
</P>
<P>
"It may well be that there is no fail-safe method of guaranteeing that never 
will a minor be able to access the dial-a-porn system," he said in the 15-page 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"For all we know from the record, the (government's) technological approach to 
restricting dial-a-porn messages to adults who seek them would be extremely 
effective, and only a few of the most enterprising and disobedient young people 
will manage to secure access to such messages," he said.

<P>
Eleven-year-old Tony Aliengena, reaching a milestone in his "friendship flight" 
around the world, landed in Leningrad today where he was greeted by a group of 
schoolchildren who crowded around to give him flowers and welcome him to the 
"land of the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
"The flight was short and easy, and it's great to be here," the boy from San 
Juan Capistrano said as he stepped out of his Cessna 210 Centurion after the 
hour-and-40-minute flight from Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven-year-old Tanya Barabash gave Tony a brown loaf of bread and a cup of 
salt -- the traditional Russian welcome -- and then recited a poem in Russian 
that she had written herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I want peace all over the world," her poem said in part. "If we die in war, 
the grown-ups will have to answer for it." 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad is the 13th stop on Tony's 17,000-mile trip, which has been dubbed 
the friendship flight because of his plan to meet with President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev next week and present the Soviet leader with a "friendship scroll" 
filled with the signatures of youngsters Tony has met during his trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters for Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
Tony has also collected letters from more than 50,000 American schoolchildren 
to give Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the letters were sent ahead by commercial flight, but I am carrying a 
bag with the letters written by my own classmates back home," Tony said. 
</P>
<P>
The two dozen Soviet youngsters who gathered at the Leningrad airport regarded 
the American boy as something of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know much about him but I know he's famous and he likes fishing," said 
Kirill Yefimov, who just turned 16 this week. "I like fishing too, so I shall 
make friends with him." 
</P>
<P>
Other children in the group handed Tony several dozen carnations. 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome you to the city on the River Neva," one told him, referring to the 
river on which Leningrad was built. "We welcome you to the land of the 
Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Represents Freedom 
</P>
<P>
Gennady P. Alferenko, chairman of the Soviet Foundation of Social Invention, 
which is sponsoring Tony's stay in the Soviet Union, said the visit, which also 
involves stops in Vilnius, the capital of the Baltic republic of Lithuania, 
Moscow and a number of smaller cities across to the Pacific Coast, will cost 
the equivalent of $70,000, all of which has been raised from private donations 
in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Alferenko said the American boy represented freedom to Soviet children. 
</P>
<P>
"He is teaching our youngsters that the entire planet is our home," Alferenko 
said. "They see Tony and think, 'Why should I spend my whole life in a Siberian 
village? I should see the world too.' "

2 ESCAPED CONVICTS LEAD OFFICERS ON FAST CHASE THROUGH SOUTHLAND

<P>
Two escaped convicts from Michigan led law enforcement officers on a high-speed 
chase from Bakersfield through Orange County to San Pedro before their car, 
reportedly stolen, ran out of gasoline this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The black Cadillac sped over Interstate 5 at speeds of up to 120 m.p.h. but 
cruised most of the way to Dana Point at about 70, Los Angeles Police Lt. Tom 
Scheidecker said. The pair then turned north on Pacific Coast Highway through 
the beach cities before the 180-mile chase ended about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after the Cadillac ran out of gas that Los Angeles police officers 
discovered the pair had escaped from a prison in Pontiac, Mich., Scheidecker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol unit that had begun the chase was forced to stop 
for gas in Santa Ana, he said. Officers from other agencies, including the Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Department and police departments in Anaheim, Costa Mesa, 
Huntington Beach, Long Beach and Signal Hill, assisted in the chase.

A 14-year-old boy shot his 12-year-old brother to death after they argued over 
baseball cards, then he killed himself, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Damien Bienash, 14, used a shotgun that apparently had been given to him by an 
adult who planned to take him hunting, said Richard A. Messner, deputy coroner 
for Rock County. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Damien and his brother, Clay, were found by their mother when she 
returned to their apartment Thursday afternoon. She had been gone for about 2 
1/2 hours, Messner said. A note was found written by Damien expressing remorse 
for the shooting of his brother, he said.

Sean P. Flanagan, a male prostitute who turned to killing homosexuals, was 
executed by lethal injection early today, mouthing his last words, "I love 
you," to the district attorney who prosecuted him for two murders. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, 28, a homosexual foamer Marine, sang hymns and read the Bible before 
being led to the execution room at Nevada State Prison, where he died of lethal 
injection 12 minutes after the drugs were administered at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the front row of witnesses to the execution was Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan 
Seaton, who had prosecuted Flanagan for the killing of two homosexual men in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan was strapped to a table but lifted his head to mouth the words, "You 
are a just man," to Seaton and then told him "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
Seaton said Flanagan had asked him not to come to the execution, but the deputy 
district attorney said it was his duty to "observe the ultimate effects of 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Flanagan, a self-proclaimed "born-again" Christian, would 
"kill more homosexuals if he ever got out." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan had confessed to strangling pianist James Lewandowski in October, 
1987, after he allegedly made homosexual advances in a motel room. Flanagan 
then cut up the body and dumped the parts in a trash container near the motel. 
Several days later he strangled Albert Duggins, a chef, saying Duggins deserved 
to die because he was a "faggot."

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) has rejoined three private clubs, at least two of 
which have no black members, from which he resigned when he was made the 
Democratic vice presidential candidate, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs are the River Oaks Country Club in Houston, the Ramada Club of 
Houston and the Middleburg Tennis Club in Middleburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen resigned from the three clubs last August. "He has been urged to rejoin 
by old friends," the spokesman said. "It was a personal decision, and I 
wouldn't expect him to say anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the clubs have restrictions against blacks, the Middleburg 
Tennis Club and the River Oaks Country Club have no blacks. The manager at the 
Ramada Club declined to say whether it has black members.

A state court judge today sentenced a former Ku Klux Klansman to life in prison 
for the 1981 beating and hanging death of a black teen-ager in Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Michael Zoghby imposed the maximum sentence on Benjamin Franklin 
Cox at the conclusion of a one-hour hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The message that should go out of this court is that no civilized society, nor 
the state of Alabama, will tolerate this kind of conduct," Zoghby said. Cox, 
28, wept during much of the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, a truck driver from Mobile, was convicted of murder May 18 for his part in 
the killing of Michael Donald. Another Klan member was convicted of murder 
earlier and sentenced to death; a third pleaded guilty to federal civil rights 
charges and became a prosecution witness, and a fourth awaits trial.

17 ARRESTED AT CHINESE UNIVERSITIES;

Police raided six Beijing university campuses today, arresting at least 17 
teachers and students and searching for an equal number of others in the 
continuing nationwide hunt for fugitive democracy movement activists, Chinese 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television and radio said a prominent university lecturer was taken 
into custody but did not say when. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign that authorities were extending the purge to the intelligentsia, 
Chinese sources said arrest warrants were issued for seven prominent 
intellectuals, one of whom escaped with his wife to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Official media announced other arrests in the crackdown on dissent that has 
netted more than 2,000 suspects since the uprising by tens of thousands of 
Beijing citizens against the June 3 armor-backed military offensive that ended 
a 22-day occupation by students of the city's central Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toll May Be 3,000 
</P>
<P>
Officials say about 300 people, including 100 soldiers, died in the street 
battles, but unofficial reports place the death toll at 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Seven people were executed Thursday in Beijing for participating in the 
insurrection and three others Wednesday in Shanghai for torching a train during 
nationwide protests against the strike in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of anti-government protesters were reported among 17 people 
executed Wednesday for crimes in the northeastern city of Jinan. 
</P>
<P>
The government, meanwhile, escalated its accusations of foreign involvement in 
the student-led movement for democratic reforms, charging that the Nationalist 
Chinese government of Taiwan instigated unrest in hopes of toppling the 
mainland's Communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were part of an official propaganda blitz aimed at convincing 
China's 1.2 billion people that the democracy movement was a 
"counterrevolutionary rebellion" by "thugs" and "criminals," justifying the 
army assault on Tian An Men Square and the crackdown on the largest 
anti-government protests in 40 years of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Armed Police 
</P>
<P>
Chinese sources on Beijing campuses said police today seized four people from 
the Beijing Film Institute, 10 at the Beijing Normal College of Physical 
Culture, one from the Political Science and Law College and two at the Beijing 
Institute of Foreign Languages. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were students and teachers, but the sources could provide no 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
They said some police were armed and carried arrest warrants for 17 other 
people at the Political Science and Law College and the Beijing College of 
Aeronautics. Those suspects, however, were not at the institutions when 
officers arrived, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing television and national radio evening news broadcasts announced the 
arrest of Liu Xiaobo, a lecturer in the Chinese language department of Beijing 
Normal University.

BUSH SIDESTEPS CIVIL RIGHTS STAND;

FAMILIES OF WORKERS SLAIN BY KLAN GET NO COMMITMENT

The families of three civil rights workers slain 25 years ago by Ku Klux 
Klansmen said they pressed President Bush today to back legislation to offset 
recent Supreme Court rulings "that have so badly eroded civil rights in this 
country," but he offered no commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the President doesn't want to commit himself in the way we need a 
commitment to the work that needs to be done to ensure the dignity of all 
citizens of the United States," said Rita Schwerner-Bender, the former wife of 
one of the slain young men, Michael Schwerner. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am disappointed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'American Heroes' 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Bush called the three men "American heroes." He said 
the best way to honor their sacrifice is "to ensure the arrogance and bigotry 
that took their lives never again exists in America." 
</P>
<P>
But spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the President told the families he has not 
committed himself to the legislation because he is waiting for the Justice 
Department to complete a review of the new Supreme Court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
The families of Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both white New Yorkers, and James 
Chaney, a black Mississippian, visited the White House before heading to 
Capitol Hill for a commemorative ceremony on the anniversary of their 
disappearance June 21, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
In a photo session with the family members before the meeting, Bush declined to 
answer reporters' questions on civil rights matters, citing his rules against 
taking questions at such times. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwerner-Bender spoke up, telling reporters the group was going to ask 
Bush to "support bipartisan legislation to deal with the Supreme Court cases 
that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteerism Pushed 
</P>
<P>
Later, speaking to reporters outside the White House, she said Bush had talked 
about volunteerism to solve pressing problems such as housing, education and 
medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he believes that a group of volunteers will solve the problem. I 
don't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she asked the President if he envisioned inviting a homeless 
family to live in his Kennebunkport, Me., summer home to help solve the housing 
problem and he replied negatively. 
</P>
<P>
The families were on a bus caravan from Philadelphia, Miss., where the three 
were killed, to Washington and New York to retrace, in reverse, the civil 
rights workers' journey to Mississippi.

A court found K mart partially responsible for injuries suffered by a customer 
who shot himself in the toe while examining a rifle he wanted to buy for his 
6-year-old son as a first-grade graduation gift. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Beach Circuit Judge Edward Garrison ruled that K mart was negligent in the 
June, 1987, accident because a clerk handed Richard Rubin, 29, the gun without 
checking to see that it was loaded. The judge awarded Rubin $10,419 on 
Thursday. He had sued for $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The jury originally awarded Rubin $16,000, but Garrison found he was 35% 
negligent, reducing the corporation's liability to 65%.

Prime Computer Inc., besieged for eight months by hostile suitor MAI Basic Four 
Inc., turned today to a friendly buyer, the New York investment firm of J. H. 
Whitney &amp; Co., in a deal valued at over $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Prime and Whitney said they have agreed to an acquisition in which Whitney 
would pay $21.50 a share in cash for 79% of the Natick, Mass.-based computer 
maker's outstanding common stock. The remaining 21% of Prime's shares would be 
exchanged for bonds with a face value of $22 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said that offer appeared to be significantly higher than 
MAI Basic Four's last bid, which was $19.50 a share in cash for 75% of Prime's 
shares and securities with a face value of $21 a share for the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
However, MAI said this week it was preparing to boost its offer, raising the 
prospect of a bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it too late for (MAI) to top this one? Presumably not. You're in an auction 
mode," said John W. Adams, who follows Prime for the Boston investment firm of 
Adams Harkness &amp; Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Prime had been searching for months for a friendly buyer, or white knight, to 
top MAI's offer. It said its board of directors unanimously approved the merger 
agreement.

Delivery of the first of two high-tech Boeing 747 jetliners assigned to shuttle 
U.S. Presidents around the world has been delayed again until at least the 
middle of next year, the Air Force said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to make this year's November deadline," Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes 
said. "Boeing, the Air Force and the (Federal Aviation Administration) are now 
working on a firm delivery date of mid-1990 or later." 
</P>
<P>
The first of the two new White House aircraft, which will be designated Air 
Force One when the President is aboard, was originally scheduled for delivery 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
But that date was subsequently delayed a year until this November by wiring 
problems and fire-control regulations for the jets, which are much bigger than 
the aging Boeing 707s used by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The 747s, being modified at a total cost of $249 million, will include 238 
miles of electric wiring and amenities from an exotic television system to 85 
telephones and giant food storage compartments.

The stock market rallied sharply to new post-crash highs today in buying 
encouraged by fresh evidence of a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 49.70 to 2,531.87, surpassing 
the previous closing high since the 1987 crash: 2,517.83 on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
The gain, the largest for the average in six weeks, left it with a net increase 
of 45.49 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 1,065 up, 430 down and 474 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 198.72 million shares, against 176.51 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index added 2.81 to 182.86. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department report this morning that new factory orders for durable 
goods fell 4.2% in May was a pleasant surprise on Wall Street, where traders 
had been expecting the figures to be unchanged or slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts saw the decline as a sign that the economy might be slowing more 
dramatically than previously forecast. 
</P>
<P>
That stirred some stepped-up talk of a possible business slump. Brokers said, 
however, that it also raised expectations of falling interest rates and reduced 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds soared about $15 
for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yield to the 8.18%-8.23% range. 
Since early spring those bond interest rates have fallen more than a percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a weakening economy 
mounts, the Federal Reserve will relax its credit policy to cushion the effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic data once again reinforced the perception that this economy is 
going to grow a lot slower before it grows faster," said Ward McCarthy, 
economist with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were up between 3/16 point and 1/4 point, intermediate maturities gained 
between 1/4 point and 7/16 point and 20-year issues advanced 1/2 point by 
midday, according to the Telerate Inc. financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
was up 3.98 to 1,171.02. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials also advanced. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.39 to 322.80.

'BIG TICKET' ORDERS DROP 4.2%; RAISES FEARS FOR JOBS

<P>
Orders for "big ticket" durable goods plunged 4.2% in May, the steepest drop in 
10 months, the government said today, raising fears that if the decline 
persists factory workers will lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods include a wide range of items, from washing machines to warships, 
expected to last three or more years. Economists track the orders closely as a 
measure of the health of the industrial sector and of the impact of interest 
rates on the economy. Persistent weakness is liable to lead to layoffs at 
manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
The plunge in May "means fewer people will be needed to make things, whether 
it's planes or cars or washing machines," said economist Cynthia Latta of Data 
Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts were less alarmed by the May report than they would normally 
have been because orders had surged in April and because May was heavily 
influenced by a sharp decline in orders for aircraft and parts that still left 
that category at strong levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose in March, April 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods fell to a seasonally 
adjusted $124.0 billion after climbing a revised 3.2% in April and 1% in March. 
The April increase had previously been estimated at 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, which swings widely from month to 
month, orders fell 2.1% in May, rose 4.5% in April and climbed 2.6% in March. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally agree that the economy is slowing this year, but there is 
considerable controversy over whether the growth will continue, albeit 
sluggishly, or whether the country will topple into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Durable-goods orders now have fallen in three out of the last five months and 
their level remains $5.9 billion below the high of $132.1 billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't resolve the issue, but I think these negative numbers certainly 
raise the specter of recession in people's eyes and make them much more attuned 
to the possibility than before," Latta of Data Resources said. 
</P>
<P>
Although transportation orders in May showed the steepest drop, 9.4%, orders 
were weak in the other sectors as well. 
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, including steel, dropped 1.5%; electrical machinery was down 
4.5%, and non-electrical machinery fell 3.4%.

Fourteen members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders say they are quitting the 
squad because new owner Jerry Jones wants them to wear skimpier uniforms, 
fraternize with the players and appear in beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Jones denied that he wanted to make such changes. 
</P>
<P>
"When (quarterback) Roger Staubach went out, he went out on top. They have 
retired. I'm resigning," cheerleader director Debbie Bond, 36, said today. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bond, all 14 veteran cheerleaders have said they will leave the 
team because of the dispute over the uniforms, The Dallas Morning News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 23 rookie members have until Monday to decide if they will stay with the 
squad, which has been training in summer camp since May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Bond, who has been with the organization for 10 years, said earlier that she 
talked with Jones on Thursday after hearing that the Arkansas oilman had told 
the players that there would be fraternization between the players and 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accept It or Move On' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You can either accept it or move on,' " Bond said. "Mr. Jones does 
not believe in rules." 
</P>
<P>
Under former owner H. R. (Bum) Bright, the cheerleaders were not allowed to 
drink or even be photographed with someone holding a drink while they were 
wearing their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggy Isip, 21, a two-year veteran of the squad, said Jones "wanted to change 
the uniform, and do you know what he wanted? Biker shorts and a halter top. He 
wants us to play hostess at parties and fraternize with the team. We've never 
done that." 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is -- he wants us to be in beer commercials," she said. "We've 
never even been able to have a drink in our hand." 
</P>
<P>
The current cheerleader uniform is shorts, long-sleeved blue shirts tied in the 
front to leave the midriff partially bare, a fringed bolero-type vest, and 
white boots. Biker shorts are made of an elastic material that molds to the 
body, while a halter top leaves the arms and back mostly bare. 
</P>
<P>
In an early afternoon news conference at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch 
headquarters, Jones said the rule remains in effect calling for cheerleaders 
not to fraternize with players or employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Those policies are intact. They are a very valuable and time-tested 
procedure," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he likes the traditional uniform of the cheerleaders and did not plan 
to change it. "It seems as though a lot of what was said in the meeting was 
speculation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cheerleading squad had its first open auditions in the spring of 1976, and 
cheerleaders now work for $15 a game -- $13.94 after taxes, said Suzanne 
Mitchell, who founded the squad at former President and General Manager Tex 
Schramm's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell resigned after 15 years with the Cowboys when Jones bought the team in 
February.

Britain's Colin Jackson handed two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom of the 
United States a rare defeat in the 110-meter high hurdles tonight in a 
four-nation track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain each won three of the opening six track events in 
the two-day meet that also includes West Germany and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other early winners were David Patrick of the United States in the 
men's 400-meter intermediate hurdles, American Esther Jones in the women's 100 
meters, Tim Simon of the United States in the men's 400 and Linford Christie of 
Britain in the men's 100. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who had not beaten Kingdom in five previous outdoor races, burst out 
of the starting blocks and built a sizable lead over Kingdom midway through the 
race. Kingdom stumbled and fell at the last hurdle, leaving American Jack 
Pierce in second place. Kingdom was unbeaten in 22 races last year, including 
17 finals, and had lost only once this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was timed in a sparkling 12.99 seconds, but it was wind-aided.

A Delaware judge approved today a tentative agreement allowing Tyson Foods Inc. 
to buy Holly Farms Corp. for $1.4 billion, a lawyer for Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, filed by lawyers for Tyson, Holly Farms and ConAgra Inc., 
requires approval of the Holly Farms board of directors, said Jim Blair, chief 
legal counsel for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"It sets the stage for a three-party settlement. I'm cautiously optimistic," 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
Blair said the proposed agreement requires Tyson to pay ConAgra $50 million to 
withdraw from the bidding for Holly Farms. The buyout will cost Tyson about 
$1.4 billion, Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson has been trying to buy Memphis-based Holly Farms since October while 
Holly Farms has been trying since November to merge with ConAgra, based in 
Omaha, Neb.
