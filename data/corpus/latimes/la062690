OCEANSIDE CITY MANAGER RESIGNS FOR ACCOUNTING POSITION; 
</P>
<P>

SOME FRICTIONS. BRADLEY HAD UNDERTAKEN AN INVESTIGATION OF THREE CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS.

Oceanside City Manager Ron Bradley, a former police officer who last year 
publicly announced that he was forwarding to the district attorney's office 
allegations of wrongdoing by three council members -- announced Monday that he 
is quitting his $101,000-a-year job to go into private business. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 50, said he is accepting a job with the nationwide accounting firm of 
Ernst &amp; Young, and will handle local government affairs out of the 
company's regional office in Irvine. The resignation is effective Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Bagley said he hopes the city can get by with a temporary city 
manager and delay recruiting a permanent successor until after the City Council 
election in November. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley said Bradley's resignation came as a surprise to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was doing a heck of a good job," Bagley said. "I think it's a loss to the 
city. When he came in, we told him we wanted him to do certain things, and he 
was doing them." 
</P>
<P>
Bagley and other council members said the city manager was not asked to leave 
the job, despite growing criticism of him in some corners of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
One city official, who asked to remain anonymous, suggested that Bradley had 
been looking "for a back door out" of City Hall because of growing friction 
between him and council members. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Bradley has sparred with one council member over the direction 
of the city's redevelopment plans, and with another because of supposed 
confusion in explaining the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
And one council member, who asked not to be identified by name, said there was 
lingering resentment over the way in which Bradley handled the investigation 
into alleged wrongdoing by three council members. 
</P>
<P>
That eight-month investigation was concluded in March when San Diego County 
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller announced that his office had found no wrongdoing by 
council members Melba Bishop, Sam Williamson and Ben Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations had been presented to Bradley by the city's public works director, 
Glenn Prentice, that the council members were involved in bribery, conflict of 
interest and misuse of public funds. Bradley, with the support of his police 
chief, hired a private investigator to look into the accusations. The city 
manager disclosed the allegations to the City Council last August, then gave 
his findings to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In his own response to the city, Miller mildly criticized Bradley for publicly 
releasing copies of the private investigator's memorandum on the very day of 
his announcement that he was seeking the district attorney's review. That 
action, Miller said, was made "over our objections -- due to the need to 
preserve the confidentiality and integrity of any pending investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that endeared him to members of the council," the council member 
said of the public disclosure of the investigation. "He put us through months 
of hell that none of us wanted to go through." 
</P>
<P>
There was also growing discontent at City Hall between various department 
managers and Bradley -- a division that became more obvious in recent weeks 
while the city hammered out its new budget, the council member said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one council member, Melba Bishop, said she was "not sorry" to see him 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a hypocrite," Bishop said. "We didn't have the best working 
relationship. My complaint with Ron was that I didn't think he was giving me 
enough information to do my job. I wasn't told things at all, or I was told too 
late. And I had serious disagreements on how he handled some personnel issues." 
</P>
<P>
Answered Bradley: "Melba and I disagree on some fundamental issues about local 
government. That is her right and responsibility. I've never felt it prevented 
us from working together. A good, healthy debate creates a more open and 
effective government." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he was under no pressure to quit. He described his relationship 
with the City Council as "cordial." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the information about the pending investigation was released on 
the advice of the city attorney's office -- and, looking back on it now, he 
said he wondered if he acted "out of ethics or naivete." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, he believes he is leaving the post on good terms with the 
council and looks forward to a change in career -- his third, from police work 
to city management to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
"Ernst &amp; Young offered me a chance to use my training, experience and 
education in an area where I'm vitally interested -- local government," Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure in Oceanside, Bradley, implementing the recommendations of a 
management consulting firm, reorganized the Police Department "to more 
traditional lines of responsibility and reporting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he is also happy that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' 
experimental sand-bypass operation system has successfully gone into operation. 
The sand pipeline sucks up sand captured on the city's northern beaches, next 
to its harbor, and carries it south to sand-starved beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Among the challenges for his successor, Bradley said, are the continued 
redevelopment of the city's downtown and beachfront properties and the 
completion of a study determining the need, design and location of a new police 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"In local government," Bradley said, "there are always grass fires to put out." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he will continue to live in Oceanside and commute to his office in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley started his public service as a police officer in El Centro and later 
in La Mesa, where he was elevated through the ranks and became city manager. He 
was hired in Oceanside in 1988, at an annual salary of $90,000, replacing 
Suzanne Foucault, who had resigned as city manager under pressure from the City 
Council.

TENTATIVE ACCORD OKD TO END JANITORS' STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: WALKOUT AFFECTED MOST OF CENTURY CITY'S OFFICE TOWERS. WORKERS WILL GET 
WAGE INCREASES, HEALTH INSURANCE, VACATIONS AND SICK PAY. 
</P>

<P>
A large international cleaning company and striking janitors announced Monday 
that they had tentatively settled a noisy and sometimes ugly three-week work 
stoppage that affected most of Century City's office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark-based ISS International Service System Inc., the nation's largest 
commercial cleaning contractor, agreed to a union contract for between 500 and 
700 of its janitorial employees in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, reached in the wake of a violent May 15 demonstration that 
resulted in 40 arrests and 16 injuries, represented a clear victory for the 
workers, most of them Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers lived on $100-a-week strike pay and food giveaways from the 
925,000-member Service Employees International Union and paraded through 
Century City with picket signs condemning the glitzy office community as 
"luxury by day, sweatshop by night." 
</P>
<P>
As union members, the janitors, who now receive about $4.50 an hour, will 
receive immediate pay increases of 10% to 15%. Next spring they will begin 
receiving health insurance, vacations and sick pay. They will be paid under an 
existing master agreement between SEIU Local 399 and two-dozen large downtown 
office buildings cleaned by ISS competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement grants Local 399 recognition as the janitors' bargaining 
representative not only in Century City but throughout the local's Los Angeles 
jurisdiction, including a dozen other downtown office buildings cleaned by ISS. 
</P>
<P>
Janitors, who ceased picketing Monday morning, will hold a ratification vote 
today. The union expects widespread approval. 
</P>
<P>
The strike began May 29 when the majority of 180 janitors in 13 Century City 
buildings walked out to protest alleged unfair labor practices and to pressure 
ISS for union recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"To make a giant stride like this is unbelievable," said Jono Shaffer, a union 
organizer who has worked with Los Angeles janitors for the past three years as 
part of SEIU's national "Justice For Janitors" organizing program. Shaffer 
faces a misdemeanor "urging to riot" charge stemming from his leadership of the 
May 15 demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to being on a new footing with these guys," said Christopher 
Burrows, an attorney representing ISS. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the negotiations said the May 15 demonstration brought a 
new sense of urgency to the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police cut short a march by 400 pro-union demonstrators in Century 
City, clubbing men and women repeatedly to force them to turn back on Olympic 
Boulevard. Widespread television footage of the police action created 
substantial sympathy for the janitors and anger among national leaders of 
organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
During informal talks between the union and ISS in New York on Friday, the 
president of an SEIU local representing 74,000 New York janitors reportedly 
threatened to send ISS' 5,000 New York janitors out on strike if a settlement 
with the Century City janitors was not reached. 
</P>
<P>
Talks were moved to Chicago on Sunday. After eight hours of negotiations a 
tentative settlement was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement calls for both sides to drop all lawsuits against each other as 
well as all National Labor Relations Board complaints. But the union is 
continuing to pursue a $10-million claim against the city of Los Angeles 
growing out of injuries suffered in the May 15 demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The Century City strike was a contentious, complicated power struggle that held 
strong significance for those segments of organized labor concerned with 
immigrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, most janitors in Los Angeles worked under a standard union 
contract that provided health benefits and pay of about $7 an hour. But a flood 
of Central American immigrants allowed non-union contractors to underbid union 
contractors. The lack of a strong organizing presence resulted in many 
buildings becoming non-union and pay dropping drastically. 
</P>
<P>
The "Justice For Janitors" campaign was effective enough to double the 
proportion of unionized janitors in downtown Los Angeles, to about 65% of those 
working in large buildings. But Century City remained a non-union bastion. This 
was particularly frustrating to union organizers because ISS, Century City's 
prime cleaning contractor, had signed union contracts in other U.S. cities. The 
union contended that by operating non-union, ISS was exploiting the vulnerable 
nature of Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The union also tried to put pressure on JMB Realty Corp., a national building 
maintenance company that hired ISS in many of the Century City buildings. But 
there was little apparent movement until the union's march from a Beverly Hills 
park into Century City exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened crystallized the issues and pointed out this glaring gap between 
people who clean these luxurious skyscrapers and the people who inhabit them," 
said David Sickler, the AFL-CIO's regional director. "The gap resembles that of 
Third World countries." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley reacted to the demonstration by issuing a rare 
call for a Police Commission investigation of tactics by police and 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the settlement, the union said Monday it will go through with a second 
Beverly Hills-to-Century City march scheduled for Thursday. Leaders said the 
march will attempt to assert their right to demonstrate. On Friday a union 
attorney obtained a Superior Court order which restrains police from cutting 
the next march short on the same grounds officers employed May 15 -- their 
suspicion, rather than on-the-spot proof, that demonstrators planned to disrupt 
traffic in Century City.

LAST-MINUTE FUNDING KEEPS MUSEUM FROM BECOMING AN ARTIFACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some good news and some bad news came out of Monday's Oxnard City Council 
meeting, as far as Carnegie Art Museum Director Andrew Voth is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided to spare the city's only museum -- once targeted for 
elimination as a way to help reduce the city's $2.8-million deficit. But the 
council trimmed the museum's budget for the next fiscal year to $151,000, a 
$16,000 reduction compared to this year. 
</P>
<P>
Voth said he does not know how the cuts will affect his three-member staff. 
"We'll probably lose the secretary in January," Voth said. "We just can't 
function without a support staff. And I would be going from full time to 
three-quarters time." 
</P>
<P>
The public museum, located at 424 S. C St., is housed in a building funded and 
constructed by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in 1906. It was the first 
municipal building in Oxnard and served as the a library and, until 1949, the 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has a permanent collection of 250 California paintings, and Voth 
brings in exhibits from local, regional and international artists. In the past 
year, for example, he showed works by Manuel Munoz Oliveras, the official 
artist of Mexico; Madeleine Rouart and Louis Labro-Font, two French 
Post-Impressionists; and famed movie star photographer George Hurrell. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also provides tours and workshops in connection with county schools 
and art classes for adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
But Voth sees rough times ahead for the small museum. In addition to the 
$16,000 lost in city budget cuts, Voth estimates that the museum lost about 
$25,000 in grants from four corporate donors who held back contributions out of 
fear that the museum was scheduled to close. 
</P>
<P>
"That's $25,000 out of the operating fund, which pays for exhibits we are 
supposed to be getting," Voth said. He said that the museum will have to reduce 
the number of exhibits from a high of about 15 different shows to four or five 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts, he said, "could possibly cut into our education program too. Because 
of the staff being so tiny, any time there's a cut in money all projects have 
to be chopped. If we have 10 fewer exhibits we will have 10 fewer school 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
Voth said he hopes to "actively engage" in fund raising to make up the lost 
money. But he said he is concerned that his small staff, which includes 
himself, a full-time curator and two part-time support staff, is too small for 
an aggressive campaign to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard artist Linda Okatch Brown, past president of the Oxnard Art Assn., was 
encouraged by the museum director's interest in looking for private donations. 
She said private fund raising was long overdue but now may have more success 
because the arts community was concerned about losing the museum and even had 
circulated a petition to save it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some support in this area, now that people are up in arms," Brown 
said. She said the city's budget cuts have forced the museum management "to 
really reach out, do more creative things." 
</P>
<P>
Voth said he was not at all surprised by this year's loss of grant money. He 
still hopes to get financial support from Mervyn's, Procter &amp; Gamble, 
Nabisco and several local banks. With the news that the museum is to be spared, 
Voth said he will start applying for grants again. "We've lost three or four 
months in the budget process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council has saved the museum for the time being, future funding 
from the troubled city is still in question. Adding to the confusion is the new 
schedule of the museum, now open to the public Thursday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If they cut funding and it's closed all the time, people think, 'Oh, it really 
is closed.' It loses momentum," Brown said. "I hardly go anymore. When it's in 
limbo it doesn't serve its purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Besides dealing with the financial problems, Voth tries to maintain a niche for 
the museum that will distinguish it from larger museums such as the Getty 
Museum, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
"We take into account the ethnic makeup of the city, the age and the general 
interest to the public. It's basically mainstream, not much cutting-edge or 
avant-garde," Voth said. "That's for the bigger museums. They are regional 
resources. We are a local resource." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Kanatani, the director of education at the Museum of Contemporary Art, sees 
a need for museums of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much art to be seen and not enough venues for it to be presented 
in," Kanatani said. "I would imagine that there are certain perspectives that 
Carnegie offers that MOCA doesn't. So people have a choice."

SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASKED TO TAKE PAY CUT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ONE-TIME ROLLBACK IN WAGES IS AIMED AT SAVING PROGRAMS AND JOBS. THE 
UNUSUAL PROPOSAL COMES FROM BLACK LEADERSHIP COALITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District are being asked to take a 
one-time, 4% cut in next year's wages as a last-ditch effort to save threatened 
school services and more than 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual proposal came Monday from a coalition of black community leaders 
and educators, who persuaded the Board of Education to postpone action on 
further budget cuts until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If applied to all the district's 77,000 employees, the unprecedented pay cut 
would save $80 million, enough to rescue all the jobs eliminated in this 
spring's round of budget cutting, according to Robert Booker, the district's 
chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
But such a move would take the consent of all seven of the district's 
bargaining groups, and in at least some cases a vote of their members. The 
board was turned down in earlier efforts to reopen contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, struggling to finish the job of slashing $220 million from the 
budget by Saturday, gave the Black Leadership Coalition on Education until 
Thursday morning to see if employee groups will agree to the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Initially saying she was "astounded . . . that we are even considering this," 
board member Roberta Weintraub urged all sides in past labor disputes to end 
personal attacks and work together to make the job-saving plan fly. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time forfeiture of raises by a teachers union would appear to be 
unprecedented, according to the National Education Assn., the nation's largest 
teachers union, and the California Teacher's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal puts enormous pressure on United Teachers-Los Angeles, the 
district's biggest union. Representing about 35,000 teachers, counselors, 
school nurses, school psychologists and librarians, UTLA led its members on a 
nine-day strike last year that brought pay raises of 8% a year for three years. 
The board then gave many of its other employees the same percentage increase. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA spokeswoman Catherine M. Carey said the union is still gathering 
information on the proposal and would wait until this morning to make a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
But a leader of another large union, John Tanner of Local 99 of the Service 
Employees International Union, said, "We're willing to take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
The 18,000 custodians, janitors, classroom aides, maintenance workers and bus 
drivers represented by Local 99, known as the School Employees Assn., account 
for a disproportionately large number of the jobs eliminated so far. Many of 
the jobs -- among the lowest-paying in the district -- are held by blacks, 
Latinos and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"This will work only if all the employee unions support it," Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the unions, which represents workers who provide many of the district's 
repair services, received a 5% wage hike this year, meaning that its members 
would get only a 1% pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
The difficultly of getting all employee groups to agree and the 
fast-approaching deadline prompted skepticism from some school board members. 
</P>
<P>
Others noted that the one-time forfeiture would simply mean an even bigger 
budget problem next year unless the board begins a comprehensive study of ways 
to fundamentally reorganize the nation's second-largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
Because of fund-juggling and other one-time savings actions it has taken so 
far, the board already faces a $100-million gap in the 1991-92 fiscal year, 
Booker said. The pay forfeiture proposal would increase that gap to $180 
million, but Booker added that it would "at least give the district an 
additional year" to resolve thorny, long-term financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Like districts all over California, costs for Los Angeles schools have been 
rising at a much faster rate than the subsidies it receives from state and 
federal governments. Sacramento provides about 75% of the district's revenues; 
another 10% comes from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The 4% pay reduction would be deducted from employees checks over the course of 
the year and would be tax deductible for employees filing so-called long-form 
income tax returns, Booker said. It would not affect base salary rates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the odds against getting widespread employee agreement, the proposal 
generated palpable excitement among members of a board clearly weary of making 
increasingly tough budget-balancing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
With roughly $30 million to go to reach a tentative, balanced budget of just 
over $4 billion, the board seemed doomed to break its promise to keep cuts away 
from the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was forged Saturday in a meeting arranged by Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles) and school board member Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
As presented to the board by John W. Mack of the Los Angeles Urban League, 
other alternatives that came from the meeting included withholding special 
integration funds from schools that have recently become predominantly 
minority, not paying employees for a certain number of days, and increasing 
class size by two in 11th and 12th grades. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the jobs cut so far affect large numbers of blacks and other minorities, 
Mack told the board: "The African-American community is prepared to share the 
pain of the budget ax, equitably, with all others, but not more so than any 
other segment of the school district." 
</P>
<P>
But board member Mark Slavkin said he thought it was ill-advised to take such a 
step without extensive overhauling of the district's way of doing business, but 
he agreed in the end to see what could be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jackie Goldberg said it will be up to the coalition to forge 
agreements with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to reopen contract talks and we were turned down, so now it's a 
community effort," she said. She added that board members will assist the 
coalition in any way they can. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, who has angered the teachers union by blaming it for the district's 
money problems, was beaming with optimism on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Praising the black community for its leadership in proposing alternatives, 
Walters told an impromptu news conference after the budget session: "I am 
confident that we can do it."

With considerable suspense, developers and the city of Oceanside are awaiting a 
Superior Court ruling that could spell either the triumph or the doom of the 
city's controversial slow-growth law. 
</P>
<P>
In a case watched throughout the state, the Building Industry Assn. of San 
Diego and Robinhood Homes are challenging the legality of Proposition A, which 
limits the city's residential development to 800 units a year. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has spent $1.5 million defending Proposition A, which voters 
overwhelmingly passed in April, 1987, to help curb the rapid growth that has 
made Oceanside, with about 130,000 residents, the third-largest city in San 
Diego County, after San Diego and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the litigation reached the California Supreme Court, but was 
returned to Superior Court in Vista, where, after several days of testimony 
earlier this month, the lawsuit has finally gone to Judge Herbert B. Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
He had been expected to issue his ruling Friday, but has postponed a decision 
to July 10. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, both sides agree on one thing: The outcome could have a 
profound effect on any city that tries to manage its growth by passing 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Stone, an attorney representing the city, said that, if the judge 
upholds the developers, "it could make it almost impossible (for cities) to 
defend these ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
That's just how the the building association and Robinhood Homes wants it. 
</P>
<P>
Association attorney Donald Worley said a ruling for the developers would have 
"a chilling effect on building caps" adopted by cities. 
</P>
<P>
Although any decision is likely to be appealed, Hoffman's decision still would 
be a watershed event in a long legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
When Proposition A became law, it limited residential building to 800 units a 
year and a set cumulative total of 10,600 new dwellings through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ordinance has exemptions allowing new homes on 10,000-square-foot 
lots and for development of housing projects for low-income people and senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, more than a dozen developers sued the city, but the field of 
litigants has been narrowed to the building association and Robinhood Homes, 
the chief developer of Del Oro Hills in Oceanside, east of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
A second developer, Cromwell Ranch, is suing the city but has consented to 
abide by Hoffman's decision in the case involving the association and Robinhood 
Homes. Although Robinhood Homes at first sought $12.8 million in damages, 
claiming the city had stymied its development plans, it since has gotten 
permits to build its 1,200 units. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if the city loses the case, it would be open to pay unspecified damages 
to Robinhood. Representatives of Robinhood Homes declined to comment on the 
case pending a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
But, money aside, the case focuses on what authority cities have to govern 
their own growth. 
</P>
<P>
The developers argue that Oceanside is violating the Constitution by illegally 
using its police powers to limit issuance of building permits. Further, the 
plaintiffs say the city is breaking state law by failing to provide its 
regional share of lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel Oceanside is one of the last affordable housing markets," said Worley, 
accusing the city under Proposition A of "driving affordable housing out of 
Oceanside." 
</P>
<P>
During three days of testimony this month, city officials sought to prove that 
Oceanside has had an excellent record of supporting housing for all income 
levels in the years since Proposition A went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Stone showed the judge a chart demonstrating that, since 1986, 
the city has granted permits to build 2,314 units for poverty-level residents 
and an additional 3,523 units for lower-to-moderate income people. 
</P>
<P>
The association countered with figures showing that families earning $45,480 a 
year cannot afford new homes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Melba Bishop, who helped write the growth-control initiative, 
is indignant that developers say the city has shirked its responsibility to 
help provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enraged the development community would try to paint the slow-growth 
ordinance as a plot to keep low-income people out of Oceanside," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the developers maintain that the city is obliged under state law to 
meet its regional share of affordable housing, Stone said there is a state goal 
-- not a requirement -- to provide housing for all economic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Stone regards the lawsuit primarily as a challenge to the constitutionality of 
a city's "basic police powers." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a test case, that's why the building industry is involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside scored an initial victory for Proposition A in June 1989 when the 4th 
District Court of Appeal, acting at the behest of the state Supreme Court, 
ruled that invalidating the ordinance wasn't the proper way of solving the 
conflicts over it. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Hoffman makes his decisions, the parties will return to court in 
October to begin testimony on another question in the case. That's whether, as 
the plaintiffs claim, Proposition A is necessary, under state law, to the 
health and safety of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lose this round, I've got another chance to invalidate the ordinance," 
said Worley. 
</P>
<P>
But Stone said the crucial issue is before the judge now, and that another 
trial isn't nearly as important to the city's defense.

OXNARD COUNCIL USES WINDFALL TO AVOID BUDGET SHORTFALL; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: A ONE-TIME INFUSION OF $1.6 MILLION AND THE ELIMINATION OF 18 1/2 
JOBS HELP THE COUNCIL BALANCE ITS BOOKS. BUT THE CITY MANAGER WARNS THAT THE 
TASK WILL BE TOUGHER NEXT YEAR.

<P>
Oxnard City Council members on Monday came up with the money to balance a 
$60-million budget for the next fiscal year but expressed fear that the 
short-term financial solution may only delay future cuts in city personnel and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The council was able to reduce a projected $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91 
fiscal year with the help of about $1.6 million in one-time revenue windfalls, 
including part of a rebate from the state-run public employees retirement 
program. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a week ago, City Manager David Mora had recommended that the 
city eliminate 64 positions to help avoid the projected deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But at its special budget meeting Monday, the council was able to balance the 
budget by eliminating 18 1/2 positions and making select cuts to some supplies 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
Of those full-time and part-time positions, the council decided to cut seven 
from the Police Department, 5 1/2 from the Parks and Recreation Department, two 
from the Finance Department and four from the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
The council spared some early targets for cuts, including the Carnegie Art 
Museum, two emergency rescue squads in the Fire Department and a six-person 
traffic enforcement team in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to give final approval of the budget today. 
</P>
<P>
But Mora predicted that the city will continue to face revenue shortfalls 
during the next two years and said the council had only delayed inevitable 
personnel and service cuts for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"You will, if you don't take reductions this year, find yourself making these 
reductions next year," Mora warned the council as the budget hearing began. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi agreed after the budget meeting concluded that the council 
used onetime revenue windfalls to delay inevitable budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us are thrilled with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The windfalls include a $1.4-million rebate from the state-run public employees 
retirement program that the city received earlier this year. The rebate was the 
result of successful investments made with the city's retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided Monday to spend $800,000 of the rebate toward reducing the 
budget and the remaining $600,000 to avoid layoffs by continuing the salaries 
of employees while they are shuffled to other city jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The council also decided to save $337,500 by putting off a five-year, 
$3-million project to remove asbestos from several city buildings. The city had 
earmarked $457,000 this year to begin the project, but the council decided to 
set aside only $120,000 toward removing the asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to gain another $200,000 next year in proceeds from 
Proposition 111, a gasoline tax measure designed to provide local governments 
with money to repair deteriorating streets. 
</P>
<P>
The council also saved an additional $264,000 by funding the Economic 
Development Department with money from the Redevelopment Agency, which makes 
money through assessment fees, and not from the general budget. 
</P>
<P>
The windfall revenues reduced the projected deficit by $1.6 million. The 
council then pared an additional $1.2 million in reductions from a list of 
possible cuts recommended by the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The council's personnel cuts include two landscape workers and a park ranger 
from the Parks and Recreation Department; a purchasing officer and an 
accounting position from the Finance Department; a records clerk, an account 
clerk, a property clerk and a four-person drunk-driving task force from the 
Police Department; and three street sweeping personnel and a pavement 
management specialist from the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, citizens and department heads have lobbied the council 
to spare programs that they feel are vital to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The loudest outcry from the community was prompted by Mora's recommendation to 
close the Carnegie Art Museum, which costs the city $140,000 a year and employs 
one part-time and two full-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the museum, including the Oxnard Cultural and Fine Arts 
Commission, warned the council that once the museum is closed it would be 
almost impossible to persuade other museums to loan art exhibits to the 
Carnegie in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Mora had also recommended eliminating the city's $398,000 annual contribution 
to the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau, which employs six full-time staff 
members. Instead, the council decided Monday to contribute $200,000 to operate 
the bureau for six months while the city studies the possibility of adding 
another 2% to the city's 9% bed tax to pay for the bureau's annual costs. 
</P>
<P>
The council has until July 24 to place such a tax measure on the November 
ballot, city officials said.

GRAND JURY CALLS FOR NEW CODE OF ETHICS; 
</P>
<P>
CONDUCT: THE PANEL CRITICIZES THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY BY COUNTY OFFICIALS 
INVOLVED IN APPROVING DAVID H. MURDOCK'S LUXURY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN LAKE 
SHERWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Grand Jury, criticizing the conduct of several public 
officials involved in billionaire David H. Murdock's Sherwood Country Club 
project, recommended Monday the creation of an ethics board to write a code of 
conduct for county officials. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury said it found no evidence that county officials acted illegally 
in working with Murdock since 1987, when his 1,900-acre country club and luxury 
housing development at Lake Sherwood was approved. 
</P>
<P>
It found, however, that some county employees and officials had created an 
"appearance of impropriety" by attending a barbecue hosted in 1989 by Murdock 
at his Arabian horse ranch in Hidden Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Several permit requests were still pending before the county at that time, the 
panel noted. And the developer's controversial proposal to form a special 
district to tax new residents -- and possibly existing ones -- for millions of 
dollars in improvements at the lake still has not been voted on by the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"Although such conduct is not illegal, citizens have the right to observe their 
public servants conducting themselves in a way which exemplifies fairness 
towards all and favoritism towards none," said the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not name the officials who attended the barbecue, but county 
Public Works Director Art Goulet said that he and more than a dozen other 
county officials and employees who had worked on the project attended the fete 
at Murdock's request. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, in whose district the project is located, 
planning chief Thomas Berg and Robert Braitman, whose county agency oversees 
the formation of special tax districts, also attended, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted the opportunity to thank everyone personally for all the work they 
had done to bring the project to fruition," Goulet said Monday. "He spent a lot 
of time explaining his vision of the project, and I think it was valuable. You 
gained a better understanding of the project in its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
Goulet said that, except for Murdock's proposal for a special tax district, the 
developer had already gained all non-routine approvals required for 
construction of 650 luxury homes near the lake near Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing unethical" in attending the barbecue, the public works 
director said. Schaefer said a county ethics code, if so strict it would have 
kept her from attending Murdock's barbecue, might also ban meetings with 
homeowners groups. "Where do you draw the line?" she said. "I don't think there 
was any breach of ethics here. 
</P>
<P>
"The essence of this report is what this project has created," Schaefer said. 
"It has saved 125 families their homes because their septic tanks were in 
failure and they had no potable water. The only solution was to bring in sewer 
and water lines, which they could not afford." 
</P>
<P>
Murdock representatives declined to comment until they read the grand jury 
report, which was released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock, in arguing before the Board of Supervisors in 1987, pledged to build 
sewer and water mains that connect existing houses to community systems, and he 
has, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that over time this project is going to be such a tremendous asset for 
the county. People will look back on this report and say, 'What are they 
complaining about,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The detailed, 22-page grand jury report, which caps six months of 
investigation, also faulted county officials for an alleged lack of 
communication that will allow Murdock to sell Lake Sherwood for millions of 
dollars rather than give it away to a community group. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Murdock pledged the "dedication" of the lake. The grand jury said that 
county supervisors testified that they thought he had committed himself to 
giving it away. In 1988, he first mentioned selling the lake, but it was not 
until last month that county officials sought to clarify his position, the 
grand jury said. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyers decided that the meaning of "dedication" was not clear in the 
original approval and concluded that they could not force Murdock to give up 
the lake without payment. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such confusion, the panel recommended changes in the way the county 
investigates proposed developments and monitors them after they are approved. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was particularly critical of Murdock's pending proposal to form a 
district to tax all of the area's property owners -- both existing and future 
homeowners -- for perhaps $20 million to repay him for improvements around the 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
To sweeten the deal for the existing 122 homeowners, Murdock agreed in 1987 to 
pay their sewer and water taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But Murdock also wants taxes to be levied against both the 122 existing 
homeowners and 650 future owners of luxury houses at his new country club to 
repay him for the millions of dollars he has spent to fill the once-empty lake 
and to repair and improve it. 
</P>
<P>
He has pledged to reimburse existing homeowners for their share of the cost of 
repairing the lake if they will join another special tax district to be formed 
soon to maintain the lake in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a special tax district to pay for all Murdock's water, sewer 
and lake improvements is expected to be considered by the Board of Supervisors 
next month. The grand jury recommended that the request be denied because 
Murdock's proposed tax district would give the developer leverage to pressure 
existing homeowners to join the lake maintenance district. 
</P>
<P>
During the grand jury investigation, lake-area residents said jurors had 
questioned them about Murdock's relationship with county officials, including 
Supervisor Schaefer, whose 1988 campaign fund-raiser Murdock hosted at his 
nearby Arabian horse ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor noted Monday that the grand jury had cleared her of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"Allegations were made by some of an improper relationship existing between the 
developer and certain elected officials within Ventura County," the grand jury 
said. "During the course of this investigation, the Grand Jury found no 
credible evidence which would substantiate those allegations."

BRUSH FIRE HITS SANTA CRUZ ISLAND; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: A RESCUE FLARE IS SUSPECTED AS THE CAUSE OF THE THIRD LARGE BLAZE TO 
STRIKE VENTURA COUNTY THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Firefighters continued Monday to battle a brush fire that had charred between 
500 and 600 acres of Santa Cruz Island by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 12:40 a.m. Monday after a flare, launched to help 
rescue people stranded on an island beach, apparently landed on a steep bluff. 
</P>
<P>
About six hours before the island fire was ignited, firefighters had 
extinguished a blaze that started Saturday and blackened 283 acres east of 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
The blazes were the second and third large brush fires this year in Ventura 
County, which officials predict could experience its most dangerous fire season 
ever because of the lingering statewide drought. 
</P>
<P>
"This county faces its worst danger in recorded history," said Fritz Cahill, a 
field officer for the Los Padres National Forest. "We're talking about real 
dry, brittle brush." 
</P>
<P>
Cahill said that plants already are as dry as they usually are in August or 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze on 62,000-acre Santa Cruz Island -- 20 miles off the coast of Ventura 
-- was expected to burn until tonight, said Carol Spears, a spokeswoman for the 
Channel Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
It had not threatened any of the about 35 people on the island, nor had it 
approached most of the structures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty firefighters were expected to remain on the island through Tuesday to 
combat the fire, which engulfed land owned by the Nature Conservancy, a 
nonprofit environmental group. The conservancy owns about 90% of the island. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Coast Guard, which rescued three stranded crew members of 
the 21-foot motorboat Frivolous, said that, if the agency is found to be 
responsible for the fire, it will reimburse firefighting groups battling the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said they received a report at 7:54 p.m. that the boat 
was beached off the northeast side of the island near China Harbor. Two cutters 
were on the scene by 11:35 p.m., Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was "pitch black," the Coast Guard launched two flares attached to 
parachutes during the next hour to illuminate the area. And workers from UC 
Santa Barbara -- which staffs an experimental station on the island -- launched 
another flare after driving to the beach to aid in the rescue, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
The rescued trio was in good health, Kennedy said. But one of the flares 
apparently set off the fire, which was well under way by the time firefighters 
from the National Park Service arrived by boat about 4:30 a.m., Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
At first light, planes brought 60 more firefighters from the Park Service, the 
U.S. Forest Service and the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at one point came within 1.5 miles of a Navy radar site, Spears said. 
But none of the other structures on the island -- a Park Service ranger 
station, a ranch and several buildings operated by the Nature Conservancy, and 
a guest ranch -- was anywhere near the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The island boasts eight plant species -- including the Santa Cruz Island monkey 
flower and the Santa Cruz Island bush mallow -- found nowhere else in the 
world, said Diane Elfstrom Devine, operations manager of the Nature 
Conservancy. But none of those species appeared to be damaged by the blaze, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those cases where the fire is not necessarily bad as long as it's 
not out of control," Elfstrom Devine said. 
</P>
<P>
While firefighters battled the blaze on the island, crews from the California 
Division of Forestry surveyed the area damaged by the fire that had raged near 
Fillmore through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mop-up, we'll be cutting through brush, clearing some areas," said 
Sandy Wells, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 firefighters and other personnel had extinguished the blaze by 6:30 
p.m. Sunday. Ventura County investigators believe the fire was intentionally 
started about 1 p.m. Saturday by two teen-agers using a lighter. 
</P>
<P>
The county's first large brush fire this year blazed for three days in the Los 
Padres National Forest near Piru Creek after a campfire was abandoned, 
officials said. The fire, which started April 13, charred 635 acres.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT CHARGED IN RAPE OF COMEDIAN'S 
GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly attacked comedian Sam Kinison's girlfriend in the comic's 
Hollywood Hills home was charged Monday with three counts of rape and two other 
related felonies. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office charged Unway L. Carter, 22, with three counts 
of rape and one count each of rape with a foreign object and forcible oral 
copulation. 
</P>
<P>
Carter is charged with raping Kinison's girlfriend last Thursday in the 
comedian's home. Following the sexual assault, the victim picked up a 
.44-caliber revolver and fired four shots at her attacker, but missed, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kinison was home asleep during the incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who is 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 300 pounds, met Kinison the 
night before and may have been acting as a bodyguard for the comedian, police 
said.

PORT DISTRICT FUNDS APPROVED BY HOUSE

<P>
Breakwater improvements and annual funding for dredging in Ventura Harbor have 
been approved by the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
If passed by the Senate and signed into law, $1.27 million would be budgeted 
for dredging and $300,000 for the breakwater improvements for the 1990-91 
fiscal year beginning Oct 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic that the Senate will approve appropriations similar to those 
of the House," said Richard Parsons, general manager of the Ventura Port 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The $300,000 would go toward preliminary engineering and design for fortifying 
and extending the breakwater. The total cost of the project is estimated at 
$6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The breakwater would keep some ocean debris from the harbor, so dredging could 
be done every two years instead of annually, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The House also voted to give $300,000 to the Army Corps of Engineers to help 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties evaluate emergency water supply options 
during the drought. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost anything having to do with water requires a permit from the corps, so 
we decided to get a head start and involve them right away. Plus they have the 
technical expertise to help out," said John Doherty, an aide to Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
Options the corps and local agencies will evaluate include shipping in water 
from Canada, recycling used water for irrigation and using desalination units.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESS IN FRUSTACI CASE LEAVES COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for Patti Frustaci, the Riverside woman who gave birth to 
septuplets after taking fertility drugs, accused the doctor whom Frustaci is 
suing for malpractice of sending an important witness out of the country so 
that he could not testify. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Dr. Ezio Zanutta, who practiced at the Westwood clinic co-owned by 
defendant Jaroslav Marik, also treated Frustaci. 
</P>
<P>
Frustaci's attorney, Browne Greene, said Monday in Santa Monica Superior Court 
that Zanutta's testimony is central to the case. Frustaci and her husband, Sam, 
blame Marik for the death of four of the premature babies and for the health 
problems of the three surviving children, who are now 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Marik's attorney, Craig Dummit, said his client had no control over Zanutta, 
denying any misdeeds. Zanutta left for Europe late last month, just before he 
was scheduled to have his deposition taken in the malpractice case. A trial is 
set for July 9.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVE FOR CALABASAS CITYHOOD GETS BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief administrator of the government agency that oversees creation of new 
cities recommended Monday that Calabasas be allowed to incorporate, giving a 
major boost to those who back cityhood for the affluent community at the west 
end of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) reverses 
recommendations made two years ago, when a Calabasas cityhood movement failed 
after LAFCO's staff concluded that such a city could not support itself. 
</P>
<P>
Although Monday's recommendation by LAFCO Executive Officer Ruth Benell does 
not guarantee approval by the commission of the drive to create an independent 
Calabasas, it is expected to have a strong influence on the commission's 
decision. A hearing is set for July 11 to consider the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
If it is approved by the commission and by the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, the proposal could be put before voters as early as November.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE IN RETIREMENT HOME KILLS MAN, 85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small fire broke out Monday morning at a Canoga Park retirement home, killing 
an 85-year-old man and forcing the temporary evacuation of several residents, 
the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
An employee of the Topanga Park Retirement Living Center tried to rescue the 
man from his burning room but was driven back and suffered slight injuries from 
smoke inhalation, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the victim, who had lived at the center about two years, was not 
released pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Inspector Manny Hernandez said the cause of the blaze was believed to be 
an electrical short circuit, possibly from a reading lamp used by the victim. 
The fire started near the man's bed but he was not a smoker, officials said. 
The fire caused an estimated $5,000 damage to the dead man's room, fire 
officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 PLEAD GUILTY TO FRAUD SCHEME AT CAR 
DEALERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four former employees of one of the nation's largest car dealerships pleaded 
guilty Monday to charges that they defrauded a number of banks and thrifts out 
of $50 million in automobile loans. 
</P>
<P>
The massive fraud scheme by employees of the defunct dealership, Grand Wilshire 
Group of Companies in Glendora, victimized Union Bank, Imperial Savings Assn., 
First Los Angeles Bank, Heller Financial Inc., General Electric Capital Corp. 
and other institutions that had extended a total of $300 million in credit to 
the dealership, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who pleaded guilty were Bruce Li, 31, of Chino, the executive vice 
president of the firm. Li admitted instructing employees on how to delete 
negative information in TRW credit reports of customers who had bought cars 
from GWG. The reports were used to secure loans for the autos, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Ronni MacLaren said.

OFF-ROAD EXCURSION BECOMES 3 MEN'S STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: THE TRUCK ROLLED DOWN A DESERT RAVINE. ONE MAN HIKED OUT TO GET HELP 
FOR THE OTHER TWO, WHO WERE MORE SERIOUSLY INJURED.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was the day after Rafael Rodriguez had spent nine hours of agony at the 
bottom of a remote ravine, dehydrated, yelling through cracked lips as he tried 
to answer searchers calling his name. 
</P>
<P>
Water had never tasted so good. 
</P>
<P>
"That was what my dinner was last night: water," the 22-year-old Van Nuys man 
said Monday as he lay in bed at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, still woozy 
from surgery. His mother, Nieves Rodriguez, was at his side. "I need a lot of 
water." 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon excursion turned into a wilderness nightmare for Rodriguez and two 
other friends from Van Nuys. Their four-wheel-drive pickup plunged off a dirt 
road and rolled over for a half-mile downhill, coming to rest upside-down in 
the thick brush of the mountainous Ritter Ridge area 10 miles east of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Michael Salentro, 20, suffered cuts and bruises but walked eight 
miles to summon help. Rodriguez, who is diabetic, and Bief Lott, 20, were too 
seriously hurt to go with him and spent about nine hours trapped in the ravine 
before they were rescued by a 30-member search team of Los Angeles County 
firefighters and Sheriff's deputies early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Lott, the driver of the truck, was in serious condition Monday with a cervical 
fracture of the spine after being transferred from Palmdale Hospital Medical 
Center to County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was in stable condition with a broken leg and sprained ankles and 
Salentro was treated and released Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Muy valiente," Nieves Rodriguez said of Salentro's dazed trek: Very brave. 
</P>
<P>
And lucky, according to paramedics Mike Murrane and Jim Beeber. They found 
Rodriguez and Lott about 2 a.m. Monday after following their cries for help 
through the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised that they were alive because of the damage to the truck," 
said paramedic Michael Murrane. He said the truck left a swath of debris as it 
rolled end over end and then side to side down the slope. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere lost amid the debris was the insulin that Rodriguez must take each 
day for his diabetes. The knowledge that Rodriguez has diabetes gave special 
urgency to the search, Murrane said. 
</P>
<P>
"His sugar level was going up," Murrane said. "It could have been very severe 
for him because he could have gone into a diabetic coma." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who works in administrative services for an insurance firm, said he 
and his friends go off-road driving each Sunday. Salentro, who works in an 
automotive shop, told searchers that the truck came around a bend in one of the 
dirt roads frequented by four-wheel-drive enthusiasts and the road suddenly 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be going very fast for that to happen on one of those 
lateral dirt roads," Murrane said. They were not wearing seat belts but were 
not thrown clear. They climbed out when the truck came to a halt, but Rodriguez 
and Lott were too seriously injured to leave the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The crash took place about 4:30 p.m. on a day when the temperature exceeded 100 
degrees. Rodriguez remembers waking up to extreme pain and thirst. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked downhill a little bit to try and get some water," Rodriguez said. He 
found none. "I was hurting. I just couldn't make it back up." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he and Lott, who was lying near the truck, talked occasionally, 
drifting in and out of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Salentro, meanwhile, hiked through two miles of mountains and six miles of 
flatlands until he came to the California Aqueduct, where a fisherman drove him 
to Palmdale and he called authorities about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The search progressed slowly as Salentro tried to remember landmarks in the 
rugged terrain in order to guide authorities, who used a helicopter and called 
out to Rodriguez and Lott on loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
The two injured men heard the amplified voices and yelled back, but the 
searchers did not get close enough to hear them until about midnight. It took 
another hour for deputies and firefighters to make their way into the ravine 
and remove them in special baskets, Murrane said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their pain, the injured men were able to joke with the paramedics as 
the ambulance made its way out of the mountains, Murrane said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire department was great," Rodriguez said. "They cheered me up. I was 
laughing and joking."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;

<P>
SUPERVISORS TO VOTE ON TESTING CONTRACT 
</P>

<P>
Ventura County is likely to receive a $1.2-million contract to continue testing 
underground gasoline tanks and monitoring any needed cleanup, according to 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
The state contract would continue a program begun in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It would pay for 10 staff members, said Janis Bassett, supervising accountant 
at the county's Resource Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors are to decide today whether to agree to a three-month 
extension of the contract, which expires Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The county has earned the renewal by being quick and effective in heading off 
potentially cancer-causing leaks of gasoline into ground water, said Hank 
Yacoub, director of the state water-quality toxics program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The county has approved cleanup at 88 sites and is working on cleanup plans at 
another 440, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of the state, however, Ventura County missed 1985, 1986 and 1987 
deadlines for issuing permits to all operators of underground tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The permits require operators to monitor existing tanks for leaks or replace 
them with leakproof tanks. All or nearly all underground-tank operators in 
Ventura County now have permits, Yacoub said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanks in the city of Ventura are not covered by the county effort. The city 
applied for a contract but was rejected because it has few tanks, said Brian 
Clark, who heads the city's locally funded program. JOANNA M. MILLER

ART DEALER GIVEN 3 YEARS IN PRISON ON DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley R. Lerner -- the 25-year-old Beverly Hills art dealer who helped 
authorities crack a major art fraud case -- was sentenced Monday to three years 
in federal prison for cocaine dealing, although U.S. District Judge Robert M. 
Tagasuki said the time could be served in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
The judge pronounced the sentence, which also included a $50,000 fine and five 
years probation, behind closed doors. He agreed to hold the session in private 
after defense lawyer Jonathan Ash said confidential information, presumably 
relating to Lerner's role as a government informant, would be discussed during 
the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Tagasuki declined to discuss the sentencing. His decision to close the entire 
hearing -- to which the government did not object -- was highly uncommon, 
according to Robert Garcia, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches 
criminal law at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, a lot of sentencing information can be maintained confidential," 
Garcia said. "But everything from start to finish? That is extremely unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing lasted nearly an hour and included testimony from Lerner and an FBI 
agent who was involved in the cocaine case. Ash said afterward that Lerner, who 
was imprisoned briefly after his arrest, told the judge he felt he had been 
rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically told the court that the brief taste that he got of jail in the 
inception of this case made him realize how futile a life that was," Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ash nor prosecutor Gary Lincenberg would say whether Lerner, who faced 
a maximum of 40 years in prison and a $2-million fine, received a lighter 
sentence because he had helped authorities. However, Lerner's co-conspirator, 
Mark Kopel, is serving a four-year term at a minimum-security federal prison 
camp in Boron, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lincenberg, whether Lerner can actually serve his time in a 
"community correctional center," or halfway house, is up to the U.S. Bureau of 
Prisons, which places prisoners. He said it is likely the bureau will follow 
the judge's suggestion. Lincenberg said it is possible that Lerner, who must 
turn himself in July 30, will be able to continue to work during his term and 
may be able to go home on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
A UCLA dropout who grew up in a middle-income family in Montebello, Lerner has 
had a business career that is studded with a variety of ventures -- from a 
compact disc store to a company that tried to market an at-home AIDS test to 
his current job as president and sole owner of TrianglE Galleries of Newport 
Beach and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest in November, 1988, his fast-track lifestyle included 
expensive cars, a luxury apartment overlooking Wilshire Boulevard, and a suite 
on the 27th floor of a Century City office tower. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Lerner pleaded guilty to federal charges that he conspired to 
distribute five kilograms of cocaine. Shortly afterward, he approached 
authorities with information that helped them arrest two art dealers he once 
did business with -- Lee Sonnier, the former manager of the Beverly Hills 
branch of the Upstairs Gallery; and Frank De Marigny, an independent art broker 
who earlier this month pleaded no contest to charges of perjury, grand theft 
and forgery. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner arranged an undercover sting in which De Marigny was arrested, and would 
have been a key witness against him had De Marigny gone to trial.

SKID ROW TENANTS FORCED OUT OF SHELTER SUDDENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of a Volunteers of America shelter for the homeless on Skid Row 
suddenly found themselves out on the street with no place to go Monday, when 
the facility locked its doors in the early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
No VOA personnel would talk about the shutdown at the 83-bed Women and Couples 
Shelter. An attorney for several of the residents claimed the closure was 
related to the organization's intention to sell the building at 611 E. 5th St. 
to the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
That $800,000 sale is contingent on the building being vacant, a CRA spokesman 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 residents Monday afternoon piled into the cramped waiting room at 
Inner City Law Center, the legal aid center on Skid Row, wondering where to go 
and how they would get their belongings out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't let me in to get my medicine," said Judy King, who returned from an 
outing to find she could not go back into the room she had been renting for 
$240 a month for four months. She needs the medicine for a kidney condition, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Mayor Tom Bradley's staff, the residents were given free 
lodging at the nearby Weingart Center for the night. 
</P>
<P>
The VOA shelter has a reputation on Skid Row for being run down. County records 
for one four-month period last year, for example, listed several violations for 
cockroach infestations, broken toilets or inoperative showers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, conditions have been worse than usual, said Debra Niles, 35, a 
resident since November. 
</P>
<P>
"The elevator doesn't work. They stopped all mail service. We can't get toilet 
tissue. And the telephones are gone," she said. "They want to put pressure on 
us to go." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure, and apparently the lockout, resulted because the residents 
threatened to thwart the projected sale of the building to the CRA, Tha Win, an 
attorney with the law center, said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Win said shelter residents first appeared in his office in mid-May, after the 
VOA handed out eviction notices saying everyone had to leave by the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"They (VOA) said it was transitory housing. But I've had tenants coming in 
saying they've been there more than six months, and paying rent -- $240 for 
women and $480 for couples," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Win claims such residents under state law deserve 30-day notices and relocation 
assistance. But his attempts to negotiate with the VOA failed. At least 24 
residents did not move. 
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's lockout, Win said, he attended one meeting during which CRA 
officials made it clear to VOA personnel that they wanted to buy only a vacant 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"That put the pressure on VOA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CRA spokesman Mark Littman said the redevelopment agency had been planning to 
buy the five-story shelter in order to turn it over to the Skid Row Housing 
Trust for renovation and eventual use as low-income apartments. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "We hadn't opened escrow on the building because the relocation 
issues weren't resolved . . . We don't have money to pay relocation."

EXTRA $11 MILLION NOT REALLY A SURPLUS

<P>
A year-end accounting adjustment shows that Ventura County has $11 million more 
in revenues than expected, but most of the money is already earmarked for 
programs and services, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Board of Supervisors will consider a request by the 
auditor-controller's office to officially recognize the $11 million, but 
Assistant Auditor-Controller Tom Mahon said the action is routine and will not 
provide more money for the county's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean all of the sudden we are $11 million richer," he said. 
"This just shows that we underestimated at the beginning of last fiscal year 
the amount of revenue we would have coming in from various sources." 
</P>
<P>
The money will be added to the county's fund balance as officials complete the 
proposed 1990-91 fiscal year budget. The chief administrator's office is 
proposing a balanced $653-million budget. KAREN McKEAN

LATINO GROUPS ORGANIZE A CONGRESS

<P>
Ventura County Latinos have a new forum for discussing common concerns. 
</P>
<P>
El Congreso, a countywide organization for Latinos, was formed by participants 
in the Latino Community Conference, held over the weekend at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to have representatives of the county's 28 Latino organizations 
meet regularly to discuss political, social and economic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a critical need for all of these groups to consolidate their 
strength," said Marcos Vargas, executive director of the social service agency 
El Concilio. "The most pressing issues at this time are youth violence, quality 
education and political representation." 
</P>
<P>
El Concilio has served as an umbrella organization for the Latino groups since 
1975, but its directors decided that an independent organization could better 
serve the needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings will be moved to a different city each time. No regular schedule has 
been set, but the group will meet at 3 p.m. July 28 at Moorpark Community 
School, 280 Casey Road, Moorpark. MAJA RADEVICH

FAIR CROWDS EXPECTED TO SURGE IN FINAL WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Mar Fair attendance is down slightly from this time last year, but fair 
officials are expecting the traditional surge during the last week ending July 
4. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of Sunday, which marked the halfway point for the 20-day fair, 
nearly 520,000 fair-goers had passed through the turnstiles, against about 
540,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual to be below the previous year and then shoot up by the end of 
the fair," said spokeswoman Diane Scholfield. "Last year, there was a point 
where we were below the previous year and then we had a humongous increase 
toward the end which pushed attendance over the 1 million mark." 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials said attendance might have been hampered because some schools 
just closed for the summer Thursday, and the fair had already been under way 
for seven days, Scholfield said. Overcast skies, which did not clear on some 
days until 1 p.m., may have also put a damper on initial enthusiasm. Plus, a 
lot of things have been going on throughout the county to vie for fair-goers' 
attention, including the 10th anniversary of Seaport Village, she said. 
</P>
<P>
If last year's survey of visitors is an indication, the typical one is a 
college graduate from the city of San Diego or North County. The largest group 
of fair-goers, about a fourth, are in the 35-to-44 age group; they come in 
pairs, and they spend about five hours at the fair. Fair visitors generate 
about a pound of trash each for a total of about 500 tons. 
</P>
<P>
The fair receives the lion's share of the fairground's $25-million budget this 
year, with profits going to pay for the next year's fair.

TRANSIT: A COMPUTER SYSTEM DISPLAYS MAPS ON A SCREEN IN THE CAR AND ASSISTS THE 
DRIVER IN AVOIDING CONGESTION. IT WILL BE TESTED ON SOUTHLAND FREEWAYS. 
</P>

<P>
You're behind the wheel of a car on the Santa Monica Freeway during the morning 
rush hour. You're new around here, so you're not sure where you are, or exactly 
where it is that you want to go. And the traffic looks like it might be 
building up ahead. 
</P>
<P>
According to Caltrans, the Federal Highway Administration and General Motors, 
it's time for "Pathfinder." 
</P>
<P>
You push some buttons, and a map appears on the bright little television screen 
mounted on your dashboard. An arrow shows you where you are and which direction 
you're headed. A series of triangles pinpoints the traffic congestion ahead. 
</P>
<P>
You push some more buttons, and a voice tells you more about the traffic 
blocking the freeway. Or, if you prefer, the same information is printed on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
You take an off-ramp, pull to the curb and punch in the address where you're 
headed. Within seconds, your destination is marked on the screen with a star. 
</P>
<P>
Using alternate routes marked on your map, you avoid the congestion and keep 
going until your arrow and the star merge. 
</P>
<P>
You're there. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, data on the location and movement of your car has been fed 
into a centralized computer system to help monitor the overall flow of traffic 
and detour drivers around bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Caltrans already has sensors in the pavement of the Santa Monica, 
San Diego and Harbor freeways that do a lot of this sort of monitoring. There 
are broadcasts over dozens of radio stations that provide much of this 
information. And all of that is free to the individual driver, as opposed to 
the $9,000 to $10,000 it currently costs to equip a car with the Pathfinder 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But the sensors and the radio can't tell you where you are or show you exactly 
where you want to go. They can't provide you with constantly updated, 
variable-scale maps that display all this, plus traffic congestion. And 
engineers say that once in general use, the per-vehicle cost would drop 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to expand our highway system significantly, so we've got to 
learn to use it better," Jerry Baxter, Caltrans regional director here, told a 
news conference at the agency's downtown offices Monday. "We are confident that 
if drivers have complete information, they will make wise commute decisions." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Pathfinder system is confined to 25 cars, all donated by General 
Motors, that will ply the Santa Monica Freeway and environs for a field test 
over the next year. The overall project, to be funded by Caltrans, the federal 
Department of Transportation and GM, is pegged at about $1.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
The special electronic hardware in each car is based on an ETAK Travelpilot -- 
a computer-driven navigational system that displays road maps on a dashboard 
television screen. In addition to an advanced ETAK system, each car has a 
two-way radio that receives traffic data from Caltrans' traffic operations 
center in downtown Los Angeles while providing the center with data on the 
car's speed, direction and location. 
</P>
<P>
The maps used for the test cover the whole Los Angeles Basin. Using the 
smallest scale, the entire region is displayed on the screen, with only 
freeways and a few other major streets delineated. Using the largest scale, 
areas covering only a few bocks appear, with each street clearly marked and 
named. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers say that within months, a single disc drive for the on-board computer 
will contain mapping data to cover the entire United States. 
</P>
<P>
To minimize the dangers of distracting the driver, some of the functions -- 
such as typing in the address of an intended destination -- can only be entered 
while the car is stationary. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Leung, a Caltrans engineer, said the yearlong test of the system will 
include three phases: 
</P>
<P>
* Caltrans employees will commute to and from work along the Santa Monica 
Freeway to evaluate the system's usefulness in avoiding congestion. 
</P>
<P>
* Drivers representing a cross-section of Southland residents will commute 
between a variety of origins and destinations. 
</P>
<P>
* Commercial drivers will use the vehicles as part of their regular business 
trips.

POOR FORESEE HEALTH CUTS AS DEADLY; 
</P>
<P>
POVERTY: OFFICIALS PREDICT DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN WITH MEASLES, TB AND 
OTHER DISEASES IF THE COUNTY SYSTEM'S BUDGET IS SLASHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hospital officials, medical staff and lawyers working on behalf of the poor 
said Monday that a $131-million reduction proposed for the Los Angeles County 
health care budget would have deadly consequences for poor children and raise 
already high levels of measles, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors will hold hearings today on the proposed reductions, a 
legal requirement to ensure that patients have access to comparable care 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't even demonstrate that now, without the cuts," scoffed Melinda Bird, 
staff attorney for the Western Center for Law and Poverty, which has collected 
93 affidavits from health care workers testifying to the effect of the funding 
reductions proposed by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The department funds six public hospitals in the county and 41 health centers 
that provide immunizations, prenatal care and treatment of infectious and 
communicable disease. Thirty-three of the health centers are slated for closure 
if the Board of Supervisors approves the cuts. The eight remaining would be 
restricted to sick patients only. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics see 88,000 patients a month. 
</P>
<P>
Bird said medical services for the poor are so burdened by inadequate funds and 
staff that, if tHe supervisors cut the budget at all, her organization will sue 
to stop the cuts from being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The center did that successfully in 1987, blocking $8 million in funding 
reductions. Last year, $55.7 million in cuts were proposed, a similar hue and 
cry was raised and none were implemented by the supervisors. The ritual of 
threatened cutbacks and vehement protest has been repeated annually at least 
for the last decade, but this year prospects of deflecting the budgetary knife 
are seen by many as jeopardized by the state's own fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has projected a $3.6-billion shortfall in the fiscal 
1990-91 state budget, and initial proposals in Sacramento to reduce funding to 
counties are what led the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services to 
prepare its plan for cutbacks of historic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatric services would be among the hardest hit. The department's proposal 
calls for closure of the children's hospital -- known as the Pediatric Pavilion 
-- at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. It also would eliminate all 
pediatric services at Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center in South-Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Sheedy, an emergency room nurse in the Pediatric Pavilion, was one of 
those who spoke at a news conference on the steps of County-USC on Monday. She 
said the hospital sees an average of 175 children a day, two to three of whom 
are so close to death that they require resuscitation. In the last months, the 
emergency room has seen five to 10 children with measles daily, several of whom 
are so seriously ill that they must be admitted to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn statement that Sheedy provided the Western Center of Law and 
Poverty, she said the minimum waiting period before a sick child can be seen by 
a doctor or nurse is now about four hours, as caseloads increase without a 
corresponding increase in staff. 
</P>
<P>
She also said the chest clinic, specializing in pulmonary illnesses, is so full 
that she must refer children with positive tests for tuberculosis to the public 
health centers for follow-up care. But these are so overcrowded, Sheedy said, 
that many of the children she has referred have gone without treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Pediatric Pavilion last year cared for 55,000 children, most of them 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"These 55,000 children are going to be in the streets of Los Angeles with 
communicable illnesses unless this county responds," said state Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles), who joined those Monday opposing the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, director of the county Department of Health Services, was out of 
town Monday and could not be reached for comment, a department spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But his deputy, Irving H. Cohen, the department's director of administration 
and finance, said that the proposed cuts, while exacerbating problems at an 
already underfunded county health care system, were the department's response 
to proposed state funding reductions. As a practical matter, though, Cohen 
said, he did not think that the county supervisors would approve the degree of 
cuts proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that the (pediatrics departments) at King and at the medical 
center are both going to be closed," Cohen said. But he does expect that 
services will have to be reduced, with the sickest children given priority. 
</P>
<P>
That does not sit well with those who say that the number of children needing 
care at these hospitals is on the rise. Nor are they happy with the annual 
budgetary battle over the medical prospects of children such as Lisbeth 
Sanchez, a wide-eyed 2-year-old who played with her mother while waiting to see 
a doctor in the outpatient cardiac clinic at County-USC's Pediatric Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Lisbeth was born with her heart on the right side and depends on medications 
and bimonthly visits to the clinic to remain healthy, her mother, Letitia 
Sanchez, explained through a Spanish-language interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"This annual budget battle has become as familiar to Californians as the 
swallows returning to Capistrano," said David Langness, representing the 
Hospital Council of Southern California in Monday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Each year for the last decade, advocates for the poor have protested proposed 
cuts in county health-care funding for the poor, and in many years they have 
succeeded in getting money restored. Such a protest was held on the steps of 
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center on Monday. Today, legally mandated 
hearings on the proposed cuts are scheduled before the Board of Supervisors. 
Those seeking the funding cuts must demonstrate that beneficiaries of the 
program will still receive services comparable to those available to people who 
are not poor. Representatives of the poor believe they have a strong case that 
the reduced services won't meet the test, but they fear the state's fiscal woes 
this year will make restoration of full funding more difficult.

85-YEAR-OLD MAN DIES IN RETIREMENT HOME FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small fire broke out Monday morning in a room at a Canoga Park retirement 
home, killing an 85-year-old man and forcing the temporary evacuation of 
several residents, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
An employee of the home tried to rescue the man from his burning room but was 
driven back and suffered slight injuries from smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 3:39 a.m. at the Topanga Park Retirement Living Center 
in the 7900 block of Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Fire Inspector Manny Hernandez 
said the cause was believed to be an electrical short circuit, possibly from a 
reading lamp used by the victim. The fire started near the man's bed, but he 
was not a smoker, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was quickly put out by about 20 firefighters, but the man, who lived 
by himself in the second-story room, was already dead. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the victim, who had lived at the center about two years, was not 
released, pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that he tried to get away," Hernandez said of the victim. "He was 
found on the floor near the door to the room." 
</P>
<P>
Before firefighters arrived, Delores Sevilla, an employee alerted by a smoke 
detector, attempted to enter the man's room but was forced to retreat because 
of heavy smoke, said Rich Lamona, administrator of the 9-year-old center. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla was taken to West Park Hospital in Canoga Park where she was treated 
for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
No other injuries were reported. Lamona said about 25 residents were evacuated 
from rooms near the fire in a rear wing of the complex. They were returned to 
their rooms in about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $5,000 damage to the dead man's room, fire 
officials said. Hernandez said investigators found no fire code violations at 
the center.

CHARLES A. MUSSON; AUDIOVISUAL COMPANY PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles A. Musson, president of Audiotronics Corp. in North Hollywood, who 
frequently lobbied Congress on diverse issues affecting small businesses and 
public schools, has died of cancer in Northridge. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
Musson was appointed by U.S. Sen. S.I. Hayakawa in the 1970s to serve on a 
presidential commission that studied problems associated with small businesses. 
He also met last year with Vice President Dan Quayle as part of another 
business organization, said his wife, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
Born Oct. 19, 1927, in Chicago, Musson died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He began his career with Audiotronics in 1968 as a vice president of marketing. 
The firm manufactures and distributes audiovisual products used in schools. He 
became company president in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He frequently traveled to Washington to lobby for increased public school 
funding as a member of the National Assn. of Audio-Visual Dealers, now called 
the International Communications Industry Assn. The group also lobbied for a 
Cabinet position for the secretary of education, a change that occurred in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 42 years; a son, David Musson of Palmdale; a 
daughter, Diana Jorgensen of Simi Valley; sisters, Merle Pearson of Boca Raton, 
Fla., and Patricia Schmidt of Bella Vista, Ark., and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at Prince of Peace Lutheran 
Church, 9440 Balboa Ave., Northridge. Burial will follow at Oakwood Memorial 
Park in Chatsworth. Donations can be made in Musson's name to the Prince of 
Peace Memorial Fund or the UCLA Medical Center/CICR. Arrangements were made by 
Bastian &amp; Perrott Mortuary of Northridge.

SANTA SUSANA-AREA HEALTH STUDY DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed health study of neighbors of the Rockwell's Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory west of Chatsworth could remain on hold until next year, while 
officials investigate whether to conduct the study, a state health officer said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert L. Holtzer, a physician and epidemiologist with the state Department 
of Health Services, said state health officials will go ahead with the health 
investigation only if a preliminary study concludes there have been 
"potentially credible exposures" to the public from the nuclear research and 
rocket test site, owned by Rockwell International's Rocketdyne division. 
</P>
<P>
A full-scale epidemiological study of Santa Susana's neighbors "might cost in 
the neighborhood of $2 million," Holtzer said. Faced with competing demands for 
health studies elsewhere, Holtzer said, it must be established that people near 
the plant may have been exposed to airborne radioactivity or chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"Just being there geographically is not significant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holtzer, who appeared at a meeting in Simi Valley of agencies involved in the 
cleanup of the Santa Susana lab, said state health officials have hired a 
contractor to review the history of the site in eastern Ventura County. But he 
said the work may require extensive analysis of Rockwell operating records, the 
cost of which may exceed the contract's ceiling of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Holtzer said, health officials have begun to assemble cancer 
incidence and birth defect data from census tracts in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties within a six-mile radius of the plant. He called such incidence data 
"a crude type of information" that rarely provides clues about causes of 
disease -- particularly in an area full of people who lived most of their lives 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
A full-blown epidemiological study would require taking detailed health 
histories from individual residents and considering such factors as age and 
time of residence. 
</P>
<P>
What the state has done so far is but the "first steps of a relatively long 
journey," Holtzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Funding is uncertain, even to complete the preliminary phase, Holtzer said. He 
said the health department is seeking a grant from the U.S. Department of 
Energy to finish the initial study. A bill by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright 
(R-Simi Valley) to authorize the study is on hold pending negotiations between 
the state and Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
With the future of the study uncertain, officials have not considered if it 
should be limited to Santa Susana. Rockwell's Canoga Park plants have been 
involved with nuclear work on a smaller scale than Santa Susana, but in more 
densely populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Holtzer said Monday he was unaware of the other plants. His boss, Dr. Lynn 
Goldman, state chief of environmental epidemiology and toxicology, said later 
that she knew of the other plants but that most concern has focused on Santa 
Susana. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the means to go out and look at every site systematically," 
Goldman said. "We're looking" at Santa Susana "because we were asked to look." 
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1940s when it was established in what was then a remote area of 
the Simi Hills, the Santa Susana lab has been used to test rockets for NASA and 
the Air Force. This has involved heavy use of chemical solvents to clean rocket 
engines, which has caused ground-water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, a 290-acre portion of the site has been devoted to development 
of nuclear and other energy technologies for the Department of Energy and its 
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. All nuclear work has ceased at the 
site, except for cleanup of mostly low-level contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear activity has generated the most public concern. 
</P>
<P>
Several accidents occurred in the past, including the partial melting of 
nuclear fuel in a test reactor in 1959. But Rockwell has said there is no 
evidence that air or water pollution has ever spread beyond its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana's last big nuclear project involved dismantling and recycling 
clear fuel elements, but that ended in 1986 for lack of government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
For a while in the 1950s, Rockwell's Canoga plant on Canoga Avenue housed a 
small test reactor. Its DeSoto plant on DeSoto Avenue had a small reactor and 
fabricated nuclear fuel from 1959 until the early 1980s.

And so, in one part of Washington, President Bush vows to push through a

And in another part of the capital, the Supreme Court hurls a knife at the

DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your tribute to the 100-year anniversary of the Dodgers (editorial, "The 
First 100 . . . ," June 15), you made two errors that even a moderate baseball 
fan, let alone a trivia buff, would catch: 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, when the great Jackie Robinson, with the help of Branch Rickey, broke 
the color barrier, he played first base, not second. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Stanky was the second baseman. Gil Hodges played a couple dozen games, at 
catcher, moving to first base in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Dodgers and Giants moved West in 1958, the westernmost team in the 
majors was the Kansas City Athletics, having moved there from Philadelphia in 
1955. Ask Tommy Dodger if he pitched for them in 1956.

OK, so driving drunk is bad. Mothers Against Drunk Driving and others have 
correctly increased our social awareness and laws are being more strictly 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Supreme Court says the Fourth Amendment to the Bill of Rights should 
be interpreted to read that citizens are only protected against "unreasonable 
searches and seizures" that are too intrusive. Are we completely giving up on 
the concept of "probable cause?" If our government continues to weigh "for the 
greater good" over the danger of any evil, can we expect to give up even more 
rights? This thinking is dangerous. What's next?

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL TO STUDY VOTE FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee directed city officials Monday to look 
into allegations of irregularities in the fractious balloting earlier this year 
to elect members to the citizens advisory panel of the North Hollywood 
redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, as acting chairman of the council's Community 
Redevelopment and Housing Committee, ordered the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area, concurred in the action, a 
Ferraro aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The probe will focus on the election activities of the Project Area Committee 
of the North Hollywood redevelopment project. The committee, which advises the 
city's Community Redevelopment Agency, will have a say, for example, in a 
pending plan to extend the life and taxing authority of the North Hollywood 
project. 
</P>
<P>
During testimony before the Yaroslavsky committee, Norton Halper, a CRA critic, 
alleged that the election last February of PAC members was rigged. Halper, who 
was involved in a shoving match with committee officials during the election, 
produced ballots that he said indicated the committee failed to adequately 
screen the qualifications of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Halper also alleged that committee last week adopted improper rules for filling 
nine of its 25 seats. The rules circumvent community input by allowing sitting 
committee members to select their colleagues, Halper charged. All people who 
live or own property within the 750-acre redevelopment project should be 
eligible to vote, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Spivack, CRA director of operations, said after the hearing that the rules 
for filling the vacancies are legal and denied that the committee rigged the 
previous election.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLATING FIRM OWNER SENTENCED IN DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Burbank plating company who had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of 
illegally storing and transporting cyanide-contaminated sludge was sentenced to 
three years probation and ordered to pay more than $93,500 in fines, a Los 
Angeles County investigator said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Barker, owner of Artcraft Plating and Finishing Co., was also ordered to 
perform 200 hours of community service at his sentencing last week in Burbank 
Municipal Court, said Marty Kasman, a deputy health officer with the county 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for his guilty pleas, the city of Burbank dropped 27 other charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Department of Health Services had conducted 
surveillances of the plating firm, dressed as undercover sanitation workers to 
collect the firm's garbage and put monitors in the sewers after company 
officials refused entry to inspectors last year, Kasman said. 
</P>
<P>
Cyanide was found in the sewer and in three trash bins when the firm was moving 
last year from the 100 block of Verdugo Avenue to a new location on East Santa 
Anita Avenue, Kasman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lab analysis showed this is probably the highest concentration of cyanide 
we've ever seen in a hazardous waste dumping case," Kasman said. 
</P>
<P>
Barker said in a telephone interview Monday that "we made some mistakes" during 
the move to the new plant, but that the relocation has enabled the company to 
eliminate the use of cyanide and chrome in its plating work, replacing it with 
a soaplike solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even have those chemicals anymore," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
Artcraft primarily does plating for military and aerospace contractors, Barker 
said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
HER MOST IMPOSSIBLE MISSION YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newest addition to the local-woman-makes-good category is San Diegan 
Rosemary Mariner, who, at 37, is about to become the first female to command a 
Navy aviation squadron. Cmdr. Mariner's achievement should be an occasion for 
unreserved congratulations and acknowledgement of another step in the progress 
of feminism. 
</P>
<P>
But one cannot take note of Mariner's accomplishment without also recognizing 
that an anachronistic federal law prevents Mariner from leading that squadron 
in defense of her country. The Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 
prohibits the Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps from assigning women to duty on 
"vessels or aircraft that are engaged in combat missions." 
</P>
<P>
Mariner (call sign: Saber) has logged more than 3,300 military flight hours in 
15 different types of aircraft. She will take command next month of a 
300-member Tactical Electronic Warfare squadron at the Naval Air Station in 
Point Mugu, providing simulated hostile electronic warfare for Atlantic and 
Pacific Fleet training exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions for women in the military are much improved from 1973, when Mariner 
was one of the first eight women to attend Navy flight school. Women now 
compose 10% of the Navy's force, up from 2% in 1972. That year, women could 
hold 22 of the 70 Navy job classifications. This year, they are eligible for 88 
of 102. 
</P>
<P>
Women guard bases from Okinawa to West Germany. They were fired upon while 
flying troops to battle aboard helicopters during the Panama invasion. More 
well-known is Army Capt. Linda Bray's role in leading a Military Police company 
in an assault on a Panamanian Defense Forces canine unit barracks. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress still has not legitimized women's combat role, perhaps swayed by 
the fear of female wartime casualties or the specious contention that women 
lack the strength for battle. A bill that would have allowed women in the Army 
to participate in all military activities during a trial period is effectively 
dead for this session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Mariner is convinced that manpower shortages forecast for the 1990s mean it is 
only a matter of time before women are allowed into combat. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit a wall, I am going to get under it, over it or around it," Mariner 
said in explaining her climb through the Navy ranks. "Put a wall in front of 
me, and my reaction is to knock it down." 
</P>
<P>
We'll cheer loudest when Mariner scales this barrier, or, better yet, when it 
comes tumbling down.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN TO STAND TRIAL IN ATTACK WITH ACID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hacienda Heights man was ordered Monday to stand trial for allegedly blinding 
and disfiguring a Glendale woman by throwing acid in her face. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day preliminary hearing, a Glendale Municipal Court judge ordered 
Emad Fawzi Kalta, 20, to be arraigned on July 10 in Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kalta is charged with aggravated mayhem, mayhem resulting in great bodily 
injury and assault with a caustic chemical. If convicted, he could be sentenced 
to life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Kalta approached Shushan Eloyan, 23, last July on 
Adams Street and asked her a question. When she turned to respond, Kalta 
allegedly threw a jar of nitric acid in Eloyan's face. Prosecutors have said 
the attack may have been an act of vengeance triggered by a dispute between 
members of the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses testified during the hearing that they saw Kalta carrying a 
jar of liquid and running toward Eloyan. A fingerprint analyst testified that 
Kalta's fingerprints were found on the jar.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LAKESIDE

<P>
Jury selection will resume today in the trial of an El Cajon man accused of 
killing his ex-wife, her 5-month-old fetus, a 16-year-old boy and his brother 
at a Lakeside house in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Aristeo Hernandez, 28, was assigned last week to San Diego Superior 
Court Judge J. Perry Langford, and jury selection began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is also charged with special-circumstances counts on grounds that 
multiple murders were committed. The district attorney's office has decided not 
to seek the death penalty against Hernandez, but instead opt for a life 
sentence without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were Theresa Ann Hernandez, 24; Jose Mireles-Rodriguez, 16; Jose 
Luis Mireles-Rodriguez, 20, and the fetus, which was male. All were shot to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the Nov. 16, 1988, killings, Hernandez received a court notice 
that his wages as a cabinetmaker would be garnished for failure to pay child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is in County Jail on $1-million bail.

<P>
The National Labor Relations Board rejected numerous complaints filed against 
the Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees Union, Local 30, and affirmed 
the union's right to represent Host International workers at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
NLRB official Karin V. Gearhard overruled "in their entirety" the objections 
filed by employee Perry Cruz and Host in March. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, who is a union member, and Host alleged that Local 30 officials had 
engaged in unfair campaigning and coercive conduct during a recent 
decertification election. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed election arose from an unsuccessful attempt by Host to decertify 
the union in February. Host workers voted to retain the union, 103 to 78. 
Gearhard's ruling was released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Host and Local 30 are engaged in bitter negotiations for a new contract. The 
union's old contract with the company expired in December. Earlier this month, 
the San Diego Board of Port Commissioners told the company that it must pay 
prevailing wages to its employees. The union has alleged that Host's San Diego 
employees earn less than other local workers who perform the same jobs.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: JAMUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 36-year-old San Diego man was arrested Monday in connection with the killing 
of an unidentified woman in the Jamul area, said Sgt. Steve Wood of the Sheriff 
Department's homicide unit. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said witnesses called the department after seeing a man and a woman 
arguing at the side of California 94, also known as Campo Road, about a mile 
west of Honey Springs Road shortly after 3 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the man was holding on to the screaming woman, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported that the highway was closed from Otay 
Lakes Road to Honey Springs Road from about 3:30 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. while 
authorities investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies found the body of a woman in brush about 20 feet off the 
road, Wood said, and paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene. Her body had 
stab wounds, but Wood said the cause of death had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Winston Elias of the 4500 block of Utah Street in North Park was booked 
into County Jail on suspicion of murder, Wood said. He had been stopped by 
deputies in the Spring Valley area as he was driving a car that matched one 
described by witnesses.

ARMSTRONG BEATS GIANTS, 5-2, FOR HIS 10TH WIN 
</P>

<P>
Jack Armstrong gave up four hits in eight innings and Todd Benzinger hit a 
three-run homer as the Cincinnati Reds defeated the San Francisco Giants, 5-2, 
Monday night at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong (10-3) continues to lead the National League in earned-run average at 
2.12. The Reds' starter gave way in the ninth to Randy Myers, who got his 14th 
save, and remained unbeaten in his six starts this season at Riverfront 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I had something to prove tonight," Armstrong said. "I'd been a little slack 
the last three or four starts. I had to get back to the grindstone, to get 
locked in again. I was glad to show my teammates I can still get them out." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong struck out six and walked one, giving up Kevin Mitchell's 18th homer 
in the fourth and a run-scoring single to Brett Butler in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"He had great stuff," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "In the last five games 
we have not hit the ball good. Tonight you face one of the best pitchers in the 
league and you expect a low-scoring game. That's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, Philadelphia 0 -- Rick Reed gave up four hits, retiring 20 of the 
last 21 Phillies in his first 1990 start, and Jose Lind had a two-run triple as 
the Pirates won at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Reed (1-0) also hit a sacrifice fly in the Pirates' three-run fourth inning. He 
struck out a career-high nine and walked two. A right-hander who was 2-4 with a 
4.70 ERA in nine previous major-league starts, Reed last won as a starter last 
Aug. 20, beating Atlanta, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, winning their second in a row after five consecutive losses, got 
only two hits in three-plus innings against Jose DeJesus. But Pittsburgh 
benefited from five walks and two wild pitches while sending Philadelphia to 
its fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, Chicago 3 -- Nelson Santovenia hit a two-run homer in the fourth 
inning and added a run-scoring single in a five-run seventh to lead the Expos 
past the Cubs at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach singled in two runs in the seventh inning that included a 
run-scoring single by Larry Walker and a run-scoring double by Mike Aldrete. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gardner (4-3) was the winner, giving up five hits in six innings. Bill 
Sampen pitched the last three innings for his first career save, sending the 
Cubs to their 11th loss in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Jerry Goff opened the seventh by drawing a walk and one out later 
Spike Owen walked. Walker greeted reliever Paul Assenmacher with a single that 
made the score 3-3. Les Lancaster relieved and got Andres Galarraga to fly out, 
but Wallach singled in two runs and Aldrete and Santovenia followed with their 
run-scoring hits. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 5, San Diego 3 -- Mike Scott continued to control the Padres in the 
Astrodome, improving his career record at home against them to 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (5-7) worked 5 2/3 innings, giving up two runs on five hits and walking 
two and striking out three. Dave Smith, the fourth Houston pitcher, worked the 
ninth for his 15th save, giving up Fred Lynn's fifth homer. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, St. Louis 2 -- The winning run scored on an error by right fielder 
Milt Thompson in the ninth inning as the Mets extended their winning streak to 
seven by beating the Cardinals in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs and a runner on first, Dave Magadan doubled off Lee Smith (1-2). 
Thompson booted the ball into the corner as Mackey Sasser scored. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone (4-4) gave up five hits in eight innings to beat the Cardinals for 
the second time in a week. John Franco worked the ninth for his 13th save.

The Boston Red Sox ended Toronto's 15-game winning streak at Fenway Park, 
beating the Blue Jays, 10-8, Monday night behind Jody Reed's tie-breaking home 
run. The Red Sox moved into the American League East lead, one-half game ahead 
of the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
"Breaking the losing streak is nice," Reed said. "It gets the monkey off our 
backs." 
</P>
<P>
Boston shelled Dave Stieb for six runs in the first inning, but John Olerud's 
two-run homer lifted Toronto into a 7-7 tie in the third. Reed hit a solo home 
run in the sixth and the Red Sox scored twice in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox beat Toronto at home for the first time since Aug. 10, 1987. The 
Blue Jays fell three games shy of the major league record of 18 consecutive 
victories on an opponent's home field. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Lamp (1-2), who relieved Dana Kiecker in the second, was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon, making his first appearance in 10 days because of back problems, 
pitched the ninth for his 11th save. He gave up a solo home run to Kelly 
Gruber, his 19th, with two out. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb threw 36 pitches without retiring a batter. His 10-2 record and five-game 
winning streak stayed intact as Willie Blair (0-5) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 4, Detroit 3 -- Bob Welch reached a career high by winning his ninth 
consecutive decision and Rickey Henderson homered, tripled and stole two bases 
as the Athletics ended a three-game losing streak by beating the Tigers at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Welch (12-2) became the top winner in the major leagues. He gave up five hits 
in eight innings, struck out four and walked four. Dennis Eckersley pitched the 
ninth for his 23rd save. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit has lost five of six. Welch beat Dan Petry (5-5) for the second time in 
six days. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's two steals gave him 36 this season and 907 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 9, Texas 1 -- Scott Erickson, just called up from double A, gave up 
four hits over six innings in his major league debut and Kirby Puckett hit a 
three-run homer as the Twins routed the Rangers at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett has 10 home runs, one more than last season. He averaged 28 from 
1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, 8-3 with a 3.03 earned-run average at Orlando, became the first 
starter to go directly from double A to the Twins since Brad Havens in 1982. 
Minnesota needed the 22-year-old right-hander to bolster a pitching staff that 
had a 4.36 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson struck out four and walked two before being relieved by John 
Candelaria, who pitched three scoreless innings for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 10, Milwaukee 5 -- Brook Jacoby homered and drove in five runs as the 
Indians won at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby hit his ninth homer, a two-run shot in the fourth, had a run-scoring 
single in the sixth and hit a two-run single in the seventh. Tom Candiotti 
(8-3) overcame two home runs by Rob Deer.

JACK SMITH: THE ETERNAL KERNEL: PACKERS CLING TO HIGH-TECH EVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since publishing a complaint from English professor Fallon Evans about those 
satanic little plastic kernels that are used to fill the empty spaces in 
packages of merchandise, I have been trying to find out their origin and name. 
</P>
<P>
Evans called them kernels and said they were walnut-shaped. They do have 
different shapes, but some of them look to me like peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever we call them, almost everyone seems to agree that they are a 
mischievous evil. They flow from one's hands, refusing to be clutched; they 
cling to one's clothes, they float to the floor and bounce under chairs and 
tables; they are almost impossible to capture and dispose of. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Herb Henrikson, the Caltech design engineer who makes machines that 
catch neutrinos and other subatomic particles, agrees that the little pellets 
are a nuisance, but he resents the public's tendency to blame technology and 
engineers for every dubious invention. 
</P>
<P>
"For as long as I can remember," he writes, "advancing technology and its 
perceived villainous perpetrators, the engineers, have been taking the rap for 
almost every annoyance dogging us in our daily lives. It is time that the 
accountants and lawyers take their share of the responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Henrikson recalls that the white pellets used for cushioning packages used to 
be "real, organic, biodegradable popcorn." He remembers receiving delicate 
instruments packed in real popcorn. He ate some, he says, and found it tough 
and chewy but edible. Later the popcorn was dyed purple, and a slip in the 
package advised that it was not edible. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect," he says, "that someone with a big appetite, a stomachache and a 
lawyer persuaded the shippers to forgo the purple popcorn. Shredded newspaper 
returned as the packing material of choice. True, the engineers came up with 
the inedible Styrofoam popcorn substitute. And true, the static cling is the 
real annoying aspect of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is a fact provided by a local supplier that there is a process 
developed by engineers that prevents the pellets from clinging to the 
customer's clothes and hands. It is a pink antistatic coated variety, but (I'm 
told) it costs 15% more than the regular stuff and they sell 10 times more of 
the clingers than the antistatic variety. 
</P>
<P>
"So in all fairness let's blame the lawyers for the end of purple popcorn and 
the accountants for standing in the way of the 15% solution." 
</P>
<P>
Henrikson's argument is seductive, but in the end it may be the public's fault 
for not wanting to pay 15% more for something it didn't want in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I should warn Henrikson against calling the popcorn Styrofoam. I don't 
know whether Styrofoam makes them, but it doesn't make plastic cups, and if you 
refer to plastic cups as Styrofoam, you hear from their lawyers, Styrofoam 
being a trademark name. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, my neighbor Mike Mauer has his own name for them: "I have just 
finished reading about those horrible little plastic pellets," he writes. "They 
are properly called baby guys, a term coined by my young nephew, Daniel, some 
years ago. I have called them baby guys ever since, in spite of their ugly, 
indestructible, and thoroughly malignant nature." 
</P>
<P>
Mauer is incensed by people who make no attempt to corral the escaped peanuts, 
popcorn, walnuts, kernels or pellets, as you wish, (several readers say they 
are called "angel poo" or "ghost poo") and dispose of them properly. 
</P>
<P>
"A few weeks ago a crew clearing brush from a slope across the street spilled a 
box of plastic pellets, without lifting a finger to capture them while they 
were relatively confined. Two cubic feet of baby guys will cover a half-acre of 
Mt. Washington in far less time than it has taken to write this paragraph. I am 
still picking the damn things up, and questioning the ancestry of the men who 
dropped them. Think globally, act locally." 
</P>
<P>
I found two plastic foam sales companies in the phone book. A woman at one 
called the pellets popcorn, though she didn't know whether popcorn was ever 
actually used; a man at the other called them peanuts. He referred me to 
STOROpack, a Downey company that makes them. 
</P>
<P>
A woman at STOROpack named Susan faxed me three yards of material on the 
various pellets they make. In the trade they are called loose-fills. 
PELASPAN-PAC looks like either a fat S or a peanut, and comes in antistatic 
pink as well as white. (By the way, the S shape is a trademark of the Dow 
Chemical Co.) STOROpack also makes saucer-shaped pellets and one, SUN-PAC, that 
is photodegradable, meaning that it disintegrates into dust under direct 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope the baby guys spilled across from Mauer's house are SUN-PAC. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it's possible that Henrikson found the popcorn tough and chewy 
because it was really plastic.

New First: Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), 74, may be the first great-grandmother in 
the history of Congress. Her great-grandchild, Andrew Hale Boggs, is the son of 
Hale and Jackie Boggs, both Los Angeles lawyers. Hale is one of the

It's coming back to haunt me," Douglas said in Dallas while promoting his new

deal to put the Trump name on a line of desk accessories and leather goods has 
gone bad in the wake of his financial problems. The News quoted a Trump

TURNING THE WORLD INSIDE OUT AND 174 OTHER SIMPLE PHYSICS DEMONSTRATIONS BY 
ROBERT EHRLICH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS $50 CLOTH, $14.95 PAPER, 216 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
If you toss a heavy boulder out of a floating rowboat, does the water level in 
the pond rise or fall? 
</P>
<P>
Here is a simple physics demonstration that provides the answer: 
</P>
<P>
Float a four-inch length of 2-by-4 in a tray not much larger than the block. 
Next, put enough pennies on the block to make its top surface just even with 
the water line. It will probably take about 50 pennies to do this. Mark the 
water line in the container. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, allow all the pennies on the barely floating block to slide into the 
water. The water level will drop slightly, as does the water level in the pond 
when a heavy boulder is tossed overboard from a floating rowboat. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, consistent with Archimedes' principle ("Eureka!" Remember?), is 
that the amount of water displaced by the sunken pennies is equal only to the 
volume of the pennies, while the amount of water displaced by the pennies on 
the floating block was equal to the weight of the pennies. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of 175 easy, illustrative and insightful demonstrations devised and 
presented by Robert Ehrlich in "Turning the World Inside Out," which should be 
required reading for all teachers of introductory physics and maybe for some 
advanced teachers as well. It is also a useful and engaging book for anyone 
interested in understanding the simple principles that underlie the physical 
world. 
</P>
<P>
In his introduction, Ehrlich, a physicist at George Mason University, says that 
he has found that everybody likes to see demonstrations, but they are usually 
too complicated or too expensive or too time-consuming for most teachers to 
bother with. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he says, as often as not, classroom demonstrations don't work right, 
which is embarrassing for the teacher and tends to put the kibosh on further 
efforts at show and tell. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich's book is an effort to remedy those problems, and it succeeds very 
well. Most of the demonstrations require minimal equipment, which is easy to 
transport and doesn't take much time to set up. I tried several of them, and 
they all worked like charms. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the demonstrations begins with a clear statement of the principle of 
physics at issue, a description of the procedure to be followed and a page or 
so of comment that includes simple equations where applicable. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that bedevil philosophers of science, the physical world is 
describable mathematically. Mathematics and physics are inextricably 
intertwined, though no one knows why. Ehrlich shows that those mathematical 
descriptions need not be forbidding. At the same time, it is possible to do the 
demonstrations and learn from them while ignoring the mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the demonstrations is called "Balancing a Stick on Its 
End." Ehrlich explains: "Newton's second law for rotation explains why long 
sticks are easier to balance than short ones, and why a weight on the top end 
of a stick makes balancing a stick easier." The equipment required: "a 12-inch 
ruler; a meter stick; a pencil; and some clay." 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich explains: "Your ability to balance a stick on your finger depends on 
the stick's length, as you can easily verify by trying sticks of different 
lengths. You should find it easy to balance a meterstick, hard to balance a 
12-inch ruler, and impossible to balance a pencil. A directly related 
demonstration is that long sticks placed on their end on a table take longer to 
topple over than short ones." 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics explaining Newton's second law of rotational motion is then 
given in a paragraph, followed by this: 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose we now consider a nonuniform stick -- for example, a stick with a clay 
ball on one end. If the clay ball is on the top end, the stick is easier to 
balance, while if it is on the bottom end the stick is harder to balance. This 
can be verified by trying to balance the 12-inch ruler with a clay ball on its 
end. Since it is hard to balance without the clay ball, adding the ball to the 
top makes balancing easier, while adding it to the bottom makes it impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many how-to science books that I remember from high school, Ehrlich's 
book could actually be used by students and teachers alike. The principles it 
illustrates are deep, but its techniques are simple. It is a most welcome 
addition to a physics library for beginners and for accomplished practitioners.

MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER OFFERS FLAT PERFORMANCE IN IRVINE

<P>
It's a noble thing Mannheim Steamroller mastermind Chip Davis is doing, 
donating concert and merchandising proceeds from his current 20-city tour to 
aid the fire-damaged Yellowstone National Park. But his "The Music of Nature" 
program with the Pacific Symphony at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Saturday 
suggested that, even in music, steamrollers and forests just don't mix. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than evoke any of the mystery or wonder of the wilderness, the new-age 
outfit and 70-piece orchestra under Davis' baton instead depicted nature as a 
series of cuddly animals hopping through a well-manicured habitat. Except for 
the addition of Sibelius' "The Swan of Tuonela" and the Davis-composed 
"Interlude V," the program of outdoors-inspired material duplicated that on the 
group's "Yellowstone, the Music of Nature" album of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' blocky conducting didn't ravage selections from Vivaldi's "The Four 
Seasons" and Respighi's "The Pines of Rome," but neither did it give them any 
life. That lassitude weighed heaviest on Sibelius' 1893 "The Swan of Tuonela" 
tone poem, which revealed none of the somber beauty it has in other hands. The 
natural world expressed in these and a Davis orchestration of Debussy's 
"Ballade" seemed a tame, ordered thing, under man's sway. 
</P>
<P>
While potentially tempestuous, "Cloud Burst," from Grofe's "Grand Canyon 
Suite," was deflated by the orchestra's disjointed performance. If orchestra 
members seemed disinterested, it's understandable, since for much of the piece, 
their playing merely supplied a background for cheesy storm-and-fire sound and 
light effects. The "multimedia" occasion also proved that orchestras look every 
bit as foolish as metal bands do enshrouded in stage fog. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' own compositions, interspersed between the real ones, were typical 
new-age fare, with lots of dragging, sustain-pedaled piano arpeggios, gurgling 
synths and sampled critter sounds. His "Sunrise at Rhodes" proved an exception, 
with its martial drums and bombastic crescendos seemingly inspired by 
gladiator-movie soundtracks. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of films, what one presumes were intended as cricket sounds on 
"Nepenthe" were so loud and distorted in the mix that they sounded more like 
the giant radioactive ants in the '50s horror flick "Them." The uneven sound 
mix also imparted a chalkboardlike character to the strings in places. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the performance was accompanied by nature films and about 700 slides 
projected to screens on either side of the stage, though all were somewhat 
washed out by the stage lighting. They did help to add a proper travelogue 
setting to Davis' tunes. Except for the disco-ish closer "Return to the Earth" 
-- on which the tennis-shod conductor played trap drums -- the Steamroller 
tracks were so jocularly uninspired that one kept expecting Bill Burrud's 
travelogue-host voice to come over it. New-age music may have had its birth 
with Erik Satie, who early in this century introduced his "furniture music" -- 
pleasant, incidental stuff intended as a background for living. But if so, 
Davis' lifeless compositions might best be described as furniture music's 
protective plastic covers.

New Kid in the Hospital: A member of the New Kids on the Block singing group 
was listed in stable condition Monday after suffering several injuries when he 
fell on stage during the grand finale of the group's concert in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. Donnie Wahlberg, 20, suffered bruises to his chest and cuts to 
his arms and his mouth during Sunday night's concert at Saratoga Raceway. He 
was admitted to Saratoga Hospital at 1:10 a.m. Monday and was taken to 
intensive care for "his privacy and protection," said Helen Edelman, director 
of community relations for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was being guarded by his personal bodyguard, who is only known as "Robo," 
she said. Wahlberg had to have stitches in his lower lip, and was having 
trouble talking Monday morning, Edelman said. At least 100 teen-age girls 
crowded the lobby of the hospital, and scores of cards and flowers from 
well-wishing fans filled the hospital. The concert was the second of the 
group's "Summer Magic" tour. Officials said that they did not know when 
Wahlberg would be released, or if the injury would affect the group's scheduled 
performance tonight in Auburn Hills, Mich. The New Kids' new album, "Step By 
Step" is currently No. 1 on the charts. GREG BRAXTON

The Orange County Black Actors Theatre has been awarded a two-year $50,000 
grant from the James Irvine Foundation as salary support for a development 
director. A foundation spokeswoman says the grant will pay $30,000 this year 
with no matching requirement. A second installment of $20,000, payable in 1991, 
will require a one-for-one match.

Cosby Gets Help From 'The Simpsons': NBC won't accept commercials featuring 
characters from "The Simpsons" because it doesn't want to cross-promote a 
program on a competing network. But that doesn't mean that NBC stars can't put 
their commercials on during "The Simpsons." In fact, Bill Cosby, who will go 
head-to-spikey head with Bart Simpson when the animated series moves to 
Thursday night in the fall, was seen Sunday during "The Simpsons" plugging his 
upcoming "Ghost Dad" flick. GREG BRAXTON

Melina Mercouri for Mayor: Melina Mercouri, Greece's popular actress turned 
fiery socialist politician, will seek to become mayor of Athens in municipal 
elections in October. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), which was 
defeated in a general election last June after eight years in power, has chosen 
Mercouri as its candidate against the ruling New Democracy Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercouri is probably the only person in PASOK popular enough to attract even 
conservative voters. If she wins the election, it could mean a new start for 
our party," a senior PASOK official said. Mercouri, 65, served as culture 
minister from 1981 until 1989 in the government of former Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou and led a campaign to promote Athens as host for the 1996 
Olympic Games. She is best known for her role as a prostitute in the 1960 film 
"Never on Sunday," for which she won an Oscar nomination. GREG BRAXTON

Former state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya's scheduled date with prison was 
temporarily delayed when his attorneys filed a motion with the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals requesting bail while his case is under review. The Whittier 
Democrat, sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for his conviction on seven 
corruption charges, had been scheduled to report to prison Friday. But now it 
will be up to the appeals court to determine whether Montoya has a substantial 
chance of winning his appeal and therefore should be allowed to remain free on 
bail.

EX-UCLA COACH BUSH MAY BECOME USC HEAD COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can you imagine Terry Donahue as the football coach at USC, given his long 
association with UCLA? 
</P>
<P>
Not so startling, but equally intriguing is the prospect of Jim Bush becoming 
USC's track and field coach. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was UCLA's track coach for 20 years and, more recently an assistant 
coach at USC, has formally applied for the head coaching job at USC. 
</P>
<P>
The position became vacant recently when the track program was restructured, 
with a coach to oversee the men's and women's programs along with two full-time 
assistants, a part-time assistant and a volunteer coach. 
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffling, Ernie Bullard, the men's coach, was given another 
assignment in the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Bush, who joined the USC staff in 1989, wasn't 
interested in becoming the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
He has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't interested for many reasons," he said. "I didn't want to become a 
head coach again. Since then, so many alums have talked to me and my former 
athletes and athletes at USC. So my hat's in the ring. I know I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, 63, said he already feels a lot younger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting the old itch again," he said. "I'm a competitor. I didn't have it 
for a while, but I got it back." 
</P>
<P>
While at UCLA from 1965 through 1984, Bush's Bruins won four NCAA 
championships, seven conference titles and 88.1% of their dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in 1966 Bush was the first UCLA coach ever to beat USC in a dual 
meet. His teams went on to beat the Trojans 12 more times. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that I can get the (USC) program going again," 
Bush said. "And it will be kind of exciting going against UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
Some assistant coaches, such as Foster Andersen in football, have worked for 
both schools, but no head coach comes to mind who has switched allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mike McGee, USC athletic director, and Barbara Hedges, associate 
athletic director, are interviewing prospects for that job and some of the 
assistant coaching jobs. Mike Bailey, the former women's coach, has already 
been retained as a full-time assistant. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that Ron Allice, the Long Beach City College coach, and John 
Chaplin, Washington State's coach, are among those interested.

Art Venegas, UCLA's weight coach, is not a candidate. He has signed a new

<P>
Tom Tellez, the University of Houston's coach, and Carl Lewis' personal coach, 
was interviewed for the men's coaching position before Bullard was hired in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to anyone about (the job)," said Tellez, who hinted that he 
might be interested if USC officials contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in hiring the most qualified person, whether that person is 
male or female," Hedges said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hedges said the interviewing process will continue as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
USC's track programs have lagged in recent years. The men scored only nine 
points in the NCAA meet earlier this month and the women scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
Long jumper Larry Myricks is facing the prospect of a lifetime ban from track 
and field. 
</P>
<P>
He has already been suspended for three months for taking an over-the-counter 
cold medicine that contained a banned substance, phenylpropanolamine, commonly 
known as PPA, at the USA-Mobil Indoor Games Feb. 23 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported last week that Myricks also tested positive for PPA at indoor 
meets in Hamilton, Canada, Jan. 12 and Seville, Spain, Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
International Athletic Assn. Federation rules call for a three-month suspension 
for the first offense of this nature; a two-year ban for a second offense and a 
lifetime ban for a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks said that the IAAF treats the three offenses as one, but has told The 
Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United 
States, that it can handle it any way they want. 
</P>
<P>
"And TAC is treating them as separate offenses," said Myricks, who has appealed 
the latest findings. 
</P>
<P>
PPA is found in Alka-Seltzer Plus, a cold medicine that Myricks took during the 
indoor season. The United States Olympic Committee maintains a hot line to 
inform athletes of banned substances, but Myricks said he didn't call to find 
out if he was taking a medicine that has an ingredient on the banned list. 
</P>
<P>
The levels found in Myricks' samples were 14.18 micrograms per milliliter at 
Hamilton and 51.1 at Seville. TAC regards anything over 1.00 to be a positive 
for a stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, 34, had mediocre jumps -- in the 26-foot range -- at the meets at 
which he was cited for taking banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster, the former UCLA star hurdler, was suspended for three months for 
reportedly taking vitamin pills that contained PPA. Quarter-miler Antonio McKay 
also reportedly took a cold medicine that contained PPA, but a review board 
rescinded his three-month suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no basis for knowing whether, in fact, the athletes just took 
Alka-Seltzer, or any other cold medicines," said Doriane Lambelet, a former 
member of the drug-testing custodial board. "The levels of the stimulants are 
high enough that a cold medicine has been taken, but a pure stimulant was taken 
on top of that." 
</P>
<P>
Myricks is one of the most durable athletes in track and field. He is a 
two-time world indoor champion and a four-time Olympian. He competed in 33 
meets last year. 
</P>
<P>
If his appeals are denied and he is subjected to a lifetime ban, what then? 
</P>
<P>
"Financially, I would be ruined," he said. "I would have to sell my house in 
Upland that I recently bought." 
</P>
<P>
If Myricks was financially dependent on his track career, why would he 
jeopardize it by knowingly taking a banned substance, even in a cold medicine? 
</P>
<P>
"Logic doesn't have a place in the whole process," Myricks said. "In the appeal 
process, the only thing we can dispute is whether it's our sample or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in support of TAC in its effort to clean up the sport, but the protocol as 
it is needs to be revamped. Not every situation is that cut and dried. They 
don't consider the irreparable harm to someone financially."

KIMBLE MAKES $100,000 POINT ABOUT HIS ALL-AROUND ABILITY

Everyone knows Bo Kimble of Loyola Marymount can score. What hardly anyone 
realized was that Kimble can play defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The big doubt about my game was defense, and I hope I showed that Bo knows 
defense," Kimble said after winning the One-On-One Challenge Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to know I like to compete and play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble outshot and out-muscled Gary Payton of Oregon State, defeating him, 
30-23, in the final of the single-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble earned $100,000, his first pro paycheck, and Payton got $50,000. The 
other six entrants each were guaranteed $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Both finalists played two previous eight-minute one-on-one games, but Payton 
had an advantage with an extra few minutes of rest while the 6-foot-5 Kimble 
battled 6-7 Lionel Simmons of La Salle, a boyhood friend of Kimble's, in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimble showed no signs of fatigue, making four three-pointers early in the 
game for a 14-5 lead, then muscling inside to draw fouls. He made 12 of 12 free 
throws in the final 4:31 and had only one field goal in that span. 
</P>
<P>
"Stamina is my strongest point after playing for Loyola," Kimble said. "You 
have to be mentally and physically tough to play there." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, the nation's leading collegiate scorer last season with a 35.3 average 
for the Lions, is expected to be a first-round pick in Wednesday night's NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm No. 1 in this draft," Kimble said, "but I feel I deserve to 
be in the top 11."

PICKING FIRST DOESN'T MEAN PICKING BEST; 
</P>
<P>
NBA DRAFT: SOME OF WEST'S GAMBLES (GREEN, DIVAC) HAVE PAID OFF. SOME OF 
CLIPPERS' SURE THINGS (WILLIAMS, FERRY) HAVEN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's draft time in the NBA, when the losers become winners and the winners 
become gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that more evident than locally, where the city's two teams briefly 
trade places. 
</P>
<P>
For one day at least, the Clippers, seemingly permanent contestants in the NBA 
lottery, grab the local spotlight and headlines with a pick at or near the top. 
</P>
<P>
For the Lakers, on the other hand, Showtime becomes low time. 
</P>
<P>
Success has its price and, for the Lakers, victory over a decade of domination 
has meant picking at or near the bottom in one draft after another. 
</P>
<P>
It's no different this time. The Clippers draft eighth with their own pick and 
13th with a choice they got from the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Ron Harper 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, thanks to a league-high 63 victories, pick last, getting the 27th 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, because of expansion, it keeps getting worse for the Lakers. Until 
several years ago, even the last choice was the 23rd. But with four new teams 
-- Charlotte, Miami, Orlando and Minnesota -- the top clubs keep moving farther 
to the rear. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Laker General Manager Jerry West says he hasn't lost his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a different attitude where we pick," West said. "If you don't 
think you can get anyone, it would be pretty depressing to draft there every 
year. You have to get a player. Otherwise, you've just wasted a year. You have 
to stay optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Even if your phone rarely rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is calling you to trade for your pick," he said. "Where we are, all 
people want to know is if we want to move up to the spot above." 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of opportunity to draft a blue chipper doesn't keep West and his 
staff from spending long hours trying to find a hidden gem. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing the players with the flashy numbers will be long gone when the Lakers' 
name is called, what does West look for in a prospect? 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know, how does he play the game?" West said. "Does he know how to 
play the game? Does he have the ability to not be selfish? Players picked down 
there have to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
West estimates that the two Laker scouts, Ronnie Lester and Gene Tormohlen, see 
100 college games a year. West himself sees about 60, and, when home, watches 
two a night on television. 
</P>
<P>
It's a challenge that West, despite the odds, has met more than once. Over the 
last five years, the Lakers have had four first-round picks, all near the 
bottom. Two of those, A.C. Green in 1985 and Vlade Divac last year, have been 
successful enough to cause some hand-wringing for those who passed on them 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was the Pacific 10 Conference player of the year as a junior at 
Oregon State, Green was still available when the Lakers selected 23rd. Green 
averaged just 14.7 points and 7.7 rebounds a game in four seasons as a Beaver. 
</P>
<P>
"Oregon State didn't shoot much," West said. "But you had to be impressed with 
(Green's) work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
With that work ethic, Green eventually elbowed Kurt Rambis out of the starting 
power forward's job. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar leaving and the Lakers stuck in the 26th 
slot of the draft without much realistic hope of getting a bona fide center, 
West held his breath as the player he wanted kept going unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers' turn came and Divac, a 7-1 raw talent from Yugoslavia with 
intriguing potential, was still there, West couldn't say his name fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he slid down there because some people might have been afraid of the 
political problems in getting him, or adjustments he was going to have to make 
here in this country," West said. "We got lucky because people would rather 
take an American." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' other top picks of the last five years didn't work out quite so 
well. With the 23rd choice in the 1986 draft, they selected Ken Barlow of Notre 
Dame, then immediately traded him, along with Mike McGee, to the Atlanta Hawks 
for Billy Thompson and Ron Kellogg, neither of whom stuck. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Lakers didn't have a first-round pick, having given it to the San 
Antonio Spurs in the deal for Mychal Thompson. With their first selection in 
the third round, the Lakers picked the forgettable Willie Glass of St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, they had the 25th selection, using it to take David Rivers of Notre 
Dame, another soon-to-disappear Laker. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' problem has never been getting top picks, just keeping them. Over 
the last five years, the club has had eight first-round selections, seven in 
the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Their biggest disappointments have been their first pick each time. Over the 
last five seasons, the Clippers have selected one who played only when he 
wanted to, one who didn't want to play at all, one who wanted to play but 
couldn't and two who wanted to play but weren't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
The record: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1985: The Clippers use the third pick of the draft to take Creighton center 
Benoit Benjamin. What follows is five years of frustration and anger as 
Benjamin battles his critics, management, fans and even fellow players because 
of an attitude he later admits was immature. He is often out of shape and out 
of touch. Only recently has he begun to realize some of the potential the 
Clippers saw half a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1986: Without a draft choice in the first two rounds, the Clippers select 
Dwayne Polee of Pepperdine in the third round. He plays one game for the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987: With the fourth pick overall, the Clippers select swing man Reggie 
Williams of Georgetown. After 2 1/2 years of ineffectiveness, he is shipped to 
Cleveland in the Ron Harper deal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988: With the first pick in the draft, the Clippers figure they can't go 
wrong with forward Danny Manning, the player of the year the previous season 
after leading Kansas to the NCAA championship. But, the hex of the Clippers 
catches up to him midway through his first season. A knee injury knocks him out 
for nearly 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989: The Clippers have the second pick overall. When the Sacramento Kings 
use the first choice to take Pervis Ellison, it appears the Clippers' luck has 
finally changed. With the second pick, they can have the first choice of most 
draft observers, forward Danny Ferry of Duke. The Clippers select him but Ferry 
plays in Italy rather than join this hapless club. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the other first-round Clipper picks over the last five years -- forward 
Charles Smith and guard Gary Grant -- came to the club in a 1988 draft-day, 
three-team deal involving the Philadelphia 76ers and Seattle Supersonics. Smith 
has become the Clippers' most consistent player, averaging 21.1 points and 6.7 
rebounds last season. Grant was averaging double figures in both points, 13.1, 
and assists, 10, when an ankle injury ended his season in February. 
</P>
<P>
After selecting Williams in 1987, the Clippers took Joe Wolf with the 13th pick 
and Ken Norman with the 19th. Norman averaged 16.1 points last season, mostly 
at small forward. Wolf, also a forward, averaged 17.2 minutes, 4.8 points, and 
3.0 rebounds.

BULLETS GET PERVIS ELLISON IN THREE-WAY TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: JEFF MALONE GOES TO JAZZ, WITH HANSEN AND LECKNER GOING TO 
SACRAMENTO. NETS DEAL FOR THEUS, MEANING THEY WILL PROBABLY PICK COLEMAN.

<P>
A three-way NBA deal Monday began with the Washington Bullets trading guard 
Jeff Malone and a draft pick to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for center 
Pervis Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings then traded Malone and a draft pick to the Utah Jazz for Bobby 
Hansen, Eric Leckner and two draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings received a second-round pick in 1991 from the Bullets and the two 
choices from the Jazz are in Wednesday's draft -- the 23rd, a first-rounder, 
and 49th. The Jazz will have Sacramento's second-round choice this week, the 
33rd overall. 
</P>
<P>
In another deal, the New Jersey Nets acquired guard Reggie Theus from the 
Orlando Magic for two second-round choices, an indication that the Nets will 
pick Derrick Coleman with the top selection in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the three-way deal, new Bullet General Manager John Nash said: "Utah 
has a force. We have a building block. This might indicate a new direction and 
a new beginning. We've obtained quality youth in Pervis." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, 28, was the Bullets' leading scorer last season, averaging 24.3 points 
per game. The 6-foot-4 guard played seven seasons with the Bullets after being 
drafted in the first round in 1983 out of Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
"In Bullets' recent history, I don't think anybody has contributed as much to 
this franchise as Jeff Malone," Coach Wes Unseld said. "He has proven he is an 
all-star player. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely happy to get a player the quality of Pervis Ellison. But I'm 
also sad in that I'm going to miss Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-11, 225-pound Ellison, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft from 
Louisville, averaged 8.0 points and 5.8 rebounds in 34 games. He had bone spurs 
removed on his right foot and right ankle and was sidelined with tendinitis in 
the big toe of his right foot last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz made it no secret they were looking for a shooting guard to augment 
the play of All-Star playmaker John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Theus, 32, gives New Jersey a durable guard who has a .472 career shooting 
percentage. Theus was the second leading scorer for the Magic last season, 
averaging 18.9 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
The move seems to eliminate two of the three players the Nets were considering 
for the top draft choice -- guard Gary Payton of Oregon State and shooting 
forward Dennis Scott of Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the 6-10 Coleman of Syracuse, the NCAA's all-time leading 
rebounder.

UTEP COACH HASKINS DENIES SCHOOL GAVE STAGGERS MONEY, TRANSPORTATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Basketball coach Don Haskins of Texas El Paso has angrily denied allegations by 
a former recruit that UTEP coaches gave the player money, housing and 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that John Staggers, a former Crenshaw 
High star, had told the NCAA that he received such favors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has been investigating UTEP's basketball program for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Staggers said that he told the NCAA that UTEP had furnished him with a place to 
live, transportation and meals during a six-week stay in El Paso in the summer 
of 1988. Staggers also implicated UTEP assistants Rus Bradburd, now at Ball 
State, and G Ray Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins has called a news conference for this morning to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done nothing illegal," Haskins said. "This is the first I've heard of 
anything like this. But I've been in constant contact with my assistant 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Haskins added, "had John Staggers passed his GED (General 
Equivalency Diploma test), I think the NCAA would be a lot more concerned we'd 
done something illegal."

Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers is expected to recover fully from 
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder, but more damage was found than 
expected and Barkley's rehabilitation time will be longer than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had a bone spur removed from his right shoulder during the two-hour 
operation at HealthSouth Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala. The doctor also 
repaired some frayed and torn ligaments in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Team physician Jack McPhilemy said the torn ligament would add at least four

IRVINE HEIRESS GETS $149-MILLION AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE RULING MAY END JOAN IRVINE SMITH'S LONG STOCK-PRICE DISPUTE 
WITH DONALD L. BREN, WHO CONTROLS IRVINE CO., NOW ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST 
DEVELOPERS.

<P>
A Michigan court referee ruled Monday that Joan Irvine Smith, an heiress of 
Irvine Co., should be paid $149 million plus interest for her stock in the 
company, now one of the biggest developers in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The decision may put to rest a bitter, seven-year dispute that pitted Smith, 
whose family founded the huge ranch in the 1860s, against Donald L. Bren, who 
now controls the company. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides seemed pleased by the ruling, in one of the largest such cases on 
record. Smith had demanded $330 million, but she and her lawyer claimed victory 
Monday. The amount, however, comes much closer to the $88 million that Bren, 
one of the nation's richest men, offered her when he bought control of Irvine 
Co. in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had argued that Bren's offer was far too low. The trial, which began in 
1987, centered on how much the company was actually worth when Bren bought it. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling is closer to the company's estimate, but we're quite pleased," said 
Howard I. Friedman, Smith's lawyer. "But I'd be less than candid if I didn't 
say the company was worth a great deal more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith, who with her mother, Athalie Clarke, owned 11% of the company: "I 
understand the Irvine Co. is saying this is a great victory. But I am not 
unhappy. I consider it a definite victory for us. It is still a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co., on the other hand, was pleased because the ruling "so clearly 
validates the fundamental fairness of the 1983 transaction in which Donald Bren 
acquired the Irvine Co.," said Gary H. Hunt, the company's senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side seemed likely to appeal the ruling Monday, although Smith said she 
would take some time to consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Some issues remain to be determined by Robert B. Webster, a retired Michigan 
judge who presided over the case. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest is a hearing to determine how much interest Smith will get on the 
$149 million. Her lawyer estimates that could add another $25 million to the 
total. Irvine Co. lawyers said it would probably be considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
Webster may also decide whether to award attorney's fees to one side or the 
other. With other costs, Irvine Co. estimates its legal expenses at $15 million 
over the last seven years and says Smith's costs are probably about the same. 
She declined comment on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who was appointed to hear the case so that it wouldn't tie up a 
Michigan courtroom for years, said he'd prefer to leave the attorney fees issue 
up to the courts but would rule if the courts insisted he do so. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was held in Michigan because the company is incorporated there. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. said it has long budgeted for an amount greater than the judge 
awarded and can pay the award through previously established lines of credit. 
The award is not payable until the issue of interest is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had been asking for about $500 million with interest. 
</P>
<P>
The high-stakes trial was the stuff of a television miniseries: On one side was 
Bren, an intense, reserved billionaire with enough land and power to impose his 
own architectural vision on a huge slice of Southern California. On the other 
side was Smith, a feisty member of the horsey set whose family traces its money 
and its toughness to the old cattle-ranching days of 19th-Century California. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, 57, bought out fellow shareholders in 1983 for $200,000 a share. They had 
bought the shares just six years earlier at $6,000, and they reaped a 3,200% 
return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 56, whose grandfather incorporated Irvine Co. in 1894 to run the 
family's vast ranch, also agreed to sell her 550 shares. But she demanded three 
times more, or $600,000 a share. Thousands of acres in Orange County's most 
desirable neighborhoods, she insisted, were worth that much. 
</P>
<P>
When they couldn't agree, the company had to go to court and ask a judge to set 
a fair price. It was Smith's right to insist on a court hearing under Michigan 
laws that protect shareholders of privately held companies from being squeezed 
out at unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent trial dragged on through 150 days in the courtroom between 1987 
and 1989. It chewed up 27,000 pages of trial transcripts and pleadings and an 
estimated $30 million in legal fees. The trial was held in a rented office 
outside Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Smith painted Bren as a conniving schemer, and Bren's lawyers portrayed her as 
a greedy, litigious eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Smith contended that Bren exaggerated the company's problems in order to 
frighten and mislead shareholders and stampede them into selling at a low 
price. 
</P>
<P>
That's ridiculous, said Bren. The other shareholders who sold to him at 
$200,000 a share were some of the most astute investors in the nation: Wall 
Street investment bankers and executives of large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Bren said it was unlikely they would underestimate the value of their stock by 
$400,000 a share. Therefore, he said, the court should accept his price as 
fair. He said the deal met the test of fairness under the law: that the buyers 
and sellers be "knowledgeable and willing." 
</P>
<P>
The referee rejected the three experts Smith put on the stand, who valued the 
company at as much as $3 billion in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The referee's ruling could make it easier for other dissident shareholders in 
private companies to challenge sales, experts said. In fact Irvine Co. argued 
that if Smith won, it would hamstring managers and enable shareholders to 
arbitrarily hold up any deal they didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
These cases are complicated because it's hard to value the stock of a privately 
held company such as Irvine Co. Unlike in a public company, the stock isn't 
traded openly on an exchange, where the price is determined by public demand 
and can be easily found in the newspaper stock tables each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. is especially hard to value because there is nothing to compare it 
to: It owns a stretch of immensely valuable Orange County land 22 miles across 
and nine miles deep in some places, an undulating brown sea squarely in the 
path of growth moving south from Los Angeles. Some of the 64,000 acres it owns 
sell for more than $1 million. It is the largest private owner of land in any 
of the nation's metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
Valuation cases are usually settled out of court because they can take years to 
resolve; few people can afford to hire lawyers and expert witnesses for that 
long. 
</P>
<P>
But with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, Bren and Smith couldn't 
reach a settlement after Bren bought the company in 1983. The two are said to 
dislike each other, which may also have hindered negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the bright side for Bren, he hasn't yet had to pay a dime to 
Smith. Irvine Co. has been able to keep and use millions of dollars it would 
otherwise have had to pay Smith in 1983 if she'd agreed to Bren's offer. 
</P>
<P>
And there is another, backhanded benefit to the ruling: Now that the referee 
says the company was worth more than Bren paid for it, it makes Bren seem a 
canny deal-maker who outsmarted some of the brightest businessmen in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling may also fuel more speculation about the size of his fortune; if the 
land is worth much more than the company says, then Bren's net worth may have 
been underestimated by Forbes magazine and others. 
</P>
<P>
Owning the company gives Bren a net worth estimated by Forbes at $1.8 billion. 
That makes him one of the 20 richest people in the nation, wealthier than much 
better-known tycoons such as Ted Turner, Donald J. Trump, Harry Helmsley, 
Rupert P. Murdoch and August A. Busch III. 
</P>
<P>
But Bren doesn't like to talk about his wealth. The profiles in national 
publications such as Newsweek make him downright uncomfortable. That's partly 
because he loathes publicity and partly because speculation about his wealth 
riles up California's powerful slow-growth movement and environmentalists, who 
question why Bren needs to develop more vacant land when he's already a 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The company always downplays the question of Bren's wealth and says that just 
because a judge, with a stroke of his pen, upped the value of the company on 
paper doesn't necessarily make it so in reality.

MOTOROLA PLANS GLOBAL CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE NETWORK IS DESIGNED TO SERVE AREAS IN THE THIRD WORLD 
AND EASTERN EUROPE THAT HAVE NO STATE-OF-THE-ART SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taking global telecommunications a giant step forward, Motorola Inc. is 
expected to unveil plans today for a $2-billion network of orbiting satellites 
to provide cellular telephone service to remote stretches of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The new system, named Iridium, will rely on 77 small, low-orbiting satellites 
to send cellular radio signals from one caller's handset to another's, without 
the need for switching towers and relay stations on which current cellular 
telephone service is based -- or poles and wires on which traditional phone 
service is based. 
</P>
<P>
The Motorola network, projected for full operation by 1996, is designed to 
serve areas now without state-of-the-art telephone service -- the primary 
markets are Third World nations and Eastern Europe -- and is expected to 
connect with traditional land-line service of all types already available in 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The network is designed to fill in the gaps of the worldwide 
telecommunications system," said Durrell Hillis, general manager of Motorola's 
satellite communications operations. "When you get to the end of the 
traditional service area, your call just gets handed up to the 'bird' orbiting 
the Earth." The system will be able to handle both voice and computer data. 
</P>
<P>
The new network, which generated widespread interest long before its official 
unveiling this morning at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, promises to 
deliver a service that experts have long predicted would become a reality 
before the end of the century: instantaneous communication and access to data 
banks, friends, family and fax machines from anywhere on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the future," says Steve Sazeguri, a telecommunications analyst with 
Dataquest, a Silicon Valley technology marketing research firm. 
</P>
<P>
The experts call it "personal communication," and they predict that it will 
expand the worldwide cellular market from about 7 million subscribers currently 
to 100 million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they say, nearly everyone will carry some sort of personal 
telephone, either on the wrist, in pockets or purses, or in a computer, that 
will allow individuals to make and receive calls wherever they are. Such 
personal phones already exist. Last year Motorola, already the world's largest 
supplier of cellular telephones, introduced a pocket-sized model weighing just 
10 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola has also teamed with International Business 
Machines to start a radio network to connect specially equipped personal 
computers. And McCaw Cellular Communications, the nation's largest cellular 
service, has launched an ambitious land-based cellular communications network 
that will give cellular customers in North America access to radio waves almost 
anywhere on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite cellular network, analysts say, is just one more step down the 
same path. 
</P>
<P>
In the new telecommunications world, everyone would have a personalized 
telephone number, much like a Social Security number, that would travel with 
individuals wherever they were. Callers using the system would not need to know 
the location of the person being called and would not need to rely upon a 
geographically based telephone code. Callers would simply dial the phone number 
of the person they wished to reach. 
</P>
<P>
Iridium or any similar system would transmit calls to telephones the same size 
as hand-held cellular phones, equipped with small radio antennae modulated to 
pick up the frequency emitted by the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
With traditional cellular service, land-based radio towers transmit calls in a 
limited area known as a cell, and transfer calls from tower to tower as users 
move -- usually in their cars -- from cell to cell. 
</P>
<P>
Iridium -- the name is based on the chemical element with 77 electrons orbiting 
around its nucleus -- works on the same principle, except a cell would cover 
hundreds of square miles. As the user changes cells, the call is transferred 
from one satellite to another. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola officials said the satellite system would be best suited to providing 
service in remote areas because each of the satellite service areas would be 
able to handle a maximum of about 10,000 telephone calls at once, a fraction of 
the number handled by traditional land-based cellular relay stations. For that 
reason, Motorola will market the system in countries with vast undeveloped 
stretches or relatively primitive telephone systems rather than in dense urban 
areas that are more economically served by existing land-based cellular 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Because large high-flying satellites cannot transmit to anything as small as a 
signal from a hand-held radio transmitter, Motorola plans a network of 
low-orbit mini-satellites, each about three feet in diameter and orbiting Earth 
at a height of 413 nautical miles. With 77 satellites, each covering an area 
about 400 miles in diameter, every point on the earth's surface is in 
continuous sight of one of the transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
Hillis said Motorola hopes to form a consortium with at least four or five 
partners to manufacture the satellites and operate the network. He said the 
company has agreements with International Maritime Satellite Organization 
(Inmarsat) in London, American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Washington and Telesat 
Mobile Inc. of Canada to explore the potential of the network. 
</P>
<P>
Inmarsat, based in London, is a cooperative of 59 member nations that provide 
communications for ships and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Hillis said Motorola has also talked to industry leaders in Australia, Japan, 
Hong Kong and Britain about the possibility of participating in the venture.

INSURER TO PAY $1.3 BILLION FOR ILFC JET-LEASING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Lease Finance Corp., the Beverly Hills-based aircraft leasing 
firm, said Monday that it will be acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary of 
American International Group Inc. in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $1.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement offers shareholders the option of accepting an all-cash 
price of $31.50 per share or a combination of 0.3 shares of American 
International stock and 50 cents for each share of ILFC stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the cash price of $31.50 per share, the transaction provides only a small 
premium over ILFC's recent share price, which closed trading Monday at $27.125. 
Analysts were disappointed by the price. 
</P>
<P>
American International is a leading international commercial and industrial 
insurer, operating in 130 countries. The New York-based firm said it would 
finance the cash portion of the acquisition from internal sources and provide 
up to $125 million of financing to ILFC. 
</P>
<P>
American International's deep pockets are considered by analysts to be the 
primary motivation for ILFC to sell out. Analysts predict that ILFC will need 
to raise $10 billion in additional capital to pay for jet aircraft on order 
over the next five years, heavily adding to its current debt of about $2.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the transaction, ILFC shareholders must approve the deal. But 
about 60% of the stock is held by company chairman Leslie L. Gonda, president 
S. F. Udvar-Hazy and vice president Louis L. Gonda. The company has just over 
two dozen employees. 
</P>
<P>
The sales agreement provides for a flexible exchange ratio of shares, based on 
future changes in American International shares. If AIG stock rises above $104 
per share, the value of the AIG stock portion will be $31.20. If it falls below 
$86, the figure will be $25.80. 
</P>
<P>
The price fetched for ILFC did not overwhelm analysts, who cited recent 
negative publicity about the ILFC's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
American International is "not overpaying," Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards' 
analyst Daniel Hersh said Monday. "If anything, there is a question of whether 
it is fair." 
</P>
<P>
Hersh said that a negative view of ILFC that has been promoted by short sellers 
of the stock holds that its future earning power is supported solely by the 
continued strength in the commercial used aircraft market. ILFC officials did 
not return phone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That view has hurt the company's stock in recent months. ILFC shares are 
selling at about 12 times their projected earnings for the next fiscal year, 
Hersh said, despite projections that the company will enjoy double-digit profit 
growth. On that basis, the stock "ought to be selling at 15 or 20 times 
earnings," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is the "aircraft bubble" -- the historic boom in commercial 
aircraft and the possibility of a collapse in the current price strength of 
those jetliners, an issued addressed in an April article in the financial 
newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer. The article focused on the extent to 
which ILFC's earning power is supported solely by growth in the prices of jet 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
ILFC leases aircraft to airlines and then sells or releases them after a fixed 
period. (It currently owns 96 aircraft.) Thus, its earning power depends to a 
great extent on the resale value of the aircraft after the lease expires, the 
article noted, rather than the ability of lease revenues to cover interest 
payments on the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
As ILFC has grown, its ability to cover interest payments with profits has 
sharply diminished, the Grant's article noted. In addition, Grant's pointed 
out, the firm was forced to take a $4.5-million charge against first-quarter 
earnings when British Island Airways, a former lessee, went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, ILFC has continued to show strong profit growth. On 
Monday, it reported that net income shot up 57% in its second quarter ended May 
31. The firm earned $24.7 million on revenue of $111.7 million, up from a 
profit of $15.7 million on revenue of $87.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"As of today, we are fully sold out through 1992 and have signed lease 
commitments covering 75% of our 1993 and 25% of our 1994 scheduled deliveries," 
Leslie Gonda said. "We look for sustained results for the remainder of the year 
and going forward."

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: BLACK ENTREPRENEURS: LOST IN THE CROWD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drive down the streets of any black neighborhood in California's big cities and 
look at who has been buying the liquor stores and beauty parlors and 
convenience markets and gas stations and fast-food places. Immigrants, mostly. 
From South Korea, India, Vietnam and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of long-established black-owned businesses, but not much 
evidence of new black entrepreneurs in black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening here? Didn't the 1980s show the most explosive increase in the 
start-up of small businesses in California history? Were blacks left out again? 
</P>
<P>
Answers -- but certainly not opinions -- are hard to come by. Some say blacks' 
traditional lack of access to capital became even more noticeable and painful 
during the booming 1980s, especially as government programs to assist minority 
entrepreneurs shrank. They add that the legacy of redlining, discrimination and 
poverty may have sapped the energy of those who otherwise might have 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
Others, shrugging their shoulders, believe that immigrants have always been the 
ones to start the most businesses in California, and that the 1980s were simply 
bigger but not different. 
</P>
<P>
Still others maintain that more blacks finally entered the corporate mainstream 
in the 1980s and that, therefore, the people most likely to open businesses in 
their old neighborhoods were less interested in taking that difficult path. 
</P>
<P>
There is no consensus among all those opinions. But what seems clear is that 
the changing demographics of California are significantly altering the economic 
landscape and making old ethnic assumptions about business obsolete. And if you 
view the 1990s wearing 1960s glasses you will likely miss many of these 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics tell part of the story. The huge increase in business formations is 
a nationwide trend, but it's a bit more pronounced in California. The Census 
Bureau estimates that the total number of businesses in the state jumped by 
more than a third between 1982 and 1987, compared to a 28% rise nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the credit reporting company, figures that in 1987 more 
than 13% of the nation's new businesses were launched in California. And the 
state's Employment Development Department reports that the largest percentage 
growth of any business sector during the 1980s was the 51% rise shown by tiny, 
often brand-new outfits with three or fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means is that more people in California are going into business 
for themselves than ever before, and they are doing so at a faster clip than 
any other Americans. They also succeed more often, with the California business 
failure rate well below the national average. 
</P>
<P>
The state's reputation as a hothouse that nurtures young business seems 
well-deserved. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, immigration has changed the culture and economics here. 
The state's population grew by 21% in the past decade, in large part through 
immigration. Ethnic patterns are changing virtually everywhere; by 1992, it's 
projected that Anglos will be no more than about 40% of the population in Los 
Angeles County, with blacks, Latinos, Asians and others making up the remaining 
60%. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, however, there has been little new immigration by 
blacks to California. In fact, some demographers have detected at least a small 
out-migration to other states. 
</P>
<P>
"The motivation of immigrants to California has always been to get rich, to 
latch onto the ring," says Gene Grigsby, a planning consultant and chair of the 
economic development subcommittee of Los Angeles 2000, a quasi-public group 
that studies local trends. "So if a population group isn't growing through 
immigration, you might expect to see less entrepreneurial zeal." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a half century ago, as California's black population swelled through 
immigration during and after World War II, entrepreneurship flourished. 
Black-owned shops and businesses lined the streets of neighborhoods in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere. Most were in the service industries -- 
the same economic sector that showed such a huge rise in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
That generation of black entrepreneurs is aging, and many have sold their 
businesses and moved away. A number of black-owned California companies born in 
the heady days of the 1960s civil rights movement did grow and prosper during 
the past decade. But the federal assistance programs that helped give birth to 
many of them have shriveled. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the traditional black neighborhoods of California that were based on 
segregated housing are fading now, with many younger blacks moving to other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
What often remains, tragically, is an underclass of unemployed people, many of 
whom have never known a black entrepreneur. Lacking incentive and a good 
education, they watch in frustration as immigrants buy businesses and move in. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the new Californians, coming from a dozen different cultures, 
have arrived with hopes every bit as high as any of their predecessors. Pooling 
money among themselves and hiring their relatives for little or no salary, they 
are buying up or starting small businesses across the state and somehow are 
making a go of it. Sometimes unaware of the cultural sensitivity involved, many 
buy shops in black communities or other economically disadvantaged areas 
because the prices tend to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
The story doesn't stop here; there may even be a happy ending. Mainstreaming 
programs begun in the 1960s have achieved some success. Although the number of 
blacks attending college is little changed, there has been an increase in those 
attending business schools. There is also a measurable increase in the number 
of blacks rising through the corporate ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these people have been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, but don't 
look for a lot of them in South-Central Los Angeles, in San Francisco's 
Fillmore District or in other traditional black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a growth of black-owned businesses in the real estate industry, 
in communications and in information processing. But these firms are scattered 
across the state, in places that might be called unlikely if you fail to grasp 
the demographic changes that are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
It's such a new development that most observers aren't sure yet just how 
significant it is. Does it mean that entrepreneurship in California is finally 
becoming colorblind? Will there be no more "traditional" black businesses? 
Maybe, but don't count on it. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, it means that you'll have to look harder to find them in the 
crowd.

ICAHN PLANS TO SLASH NUMBER OF PLANES AND FLIGHTS AT TWA

Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn said he plans to eliminate service 
to seven cities and sell or mothball 15 aircraft by October under an aggressive 
downsizing plan aimed at returning the carrier to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said a 7% reduction in TWA's flight hours would be implemented because he 
has been unsuccessful in obtaining pay and benefit concessions from the 
airline's 3,500 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
He has said since January that he might shrink the troubled airline unless 
pilots agree to $80 million a year in wage and benefit cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't keep losing $250 million a year," he said in a telephone interview. 
"I'm not going to let TWA bleed to death and end up like Pan Am or Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
A TWA spokesman identified Madison, Wis., and Nassau and Freeport in the 
Bahamas, which are considered domestic flights, as three of the cities to be 
cut. Icahn declined to identify the rest. 
</P>
<P>
TWA reported a first-quarter net loss of $143 million, compared to a net loss 
of $83.1 million a year earlier.

KOHLER BUILDING BIG FIXTURES PLANT IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
MANUFACTURING: THE HIGHLY AUTOMATED FACILITY WILL BE NEAR MONTERREY. IT MAY 
CAUSE FRICTION DURING UPCOMING U.S. UNION CONTRACT TALKS. 
</P>

<P>
Kohler Co., the giant plumbing fixtures manufacturer, has begun construction of 
a highly automated factory on 300 acres near Monterrey, Mexico, that could 
become one of the nation's largest foreign-owned plants, or maquiladoras, in 
recent history. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin-based Kohler, one of the world's top manufacturers of ceramic toilet 
bowls, sinks, lavatories, bathtubs and urinals, declined to comment on its 
plans for the recently purchased site. However, a Kohler official contacted at 
the Monterrey site said construction had already begun on the first phase of a 
highly automated ceramic fixtures factory that is scheduled for completion by 
early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In total, Kohler's land is large enough for at least 6 million square feet of 
industrial buildings, assuming about half the land is ultimately built upon, a 
relatively conservative development approach, observers said. That would be 
more than the 5 million square feet of factory space the company occupies at 
Kohler, the company-dominated town about 50 miles north of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Monday how many workers would be employed at the Monterrey 
facility and whether layoffs would result at Kohler's Wisconsin plant as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
A Kohler source speculated that the company may be reluctant to talk because of 
its upcoming contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, which 
represents about half of the 6,500 workers at Kohler. Kohler posted sales last 
year in excess of $1.3 billion. The company has 14,500 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler has been the scene of bitter labor unrest. Workers once struck the plant 
for six years, in one of the longest strikes in U.S. history, which ended in 
the early 1960s when the UAW successfully organized the plant. 
</P>
<P>
News of Kohler's new maquiladora came as a surprise to Ron Platz, vice 
president of UAW Local 833 representing the Kohler employees. Platz expressed 
fears that the development could result in lost jobs or a reduction in hours 
worked by his rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been hearing rumors for some time about them building (in Mexico) but 
there were no real hard facts," Platz said, adding that his local will begin 
negotiations on a new labor contract in August. "If it affects our employees, 
we are definitely going to register a complaint with the company." 
</P>
<P>
A Kohler spokesman said the company experienced a "work stoppage" lasting a 
couple of weeks four years ago, the last time its UAW contract was 
renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ramirez, vice president of Made in Mexico, a Chula Vista, Calif-based 
consultant who advises U.S. companies considering moving manufacturing 
operations to Mexico, said the Kohler deal ranks as "one of the major 
investments in Mexico from a U.S. point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Kohler has yet to detail its plans for the land, Ramirez said 
it could rival the size of Mexican plants operated by auto maker Chrysler Corp. 
and medical supply manufacturer Baxter International. 
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates a lot of confidence in what Mexico is trying to do" in 
attracting foreign investment, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler was founded in 1873 by John Kohler, an Austrian immigrant, and remains 
under family control. Kohler's grandson, Herbert Kohler, is now president of 
the company, one of the largest closely held companies in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
National Home Builders Assn. spokesman Jay Shackforth in Washington said Kohler 
ranks with American Standard and Delta Faucet Co. as among the world's largest 
plumbing fixture manufacturers.

Cable System Seeks CBS Affiliation: A Concord, N.H., local cable television

</P>
<P>
CBS has no affiliate in New Hampshire. The request by the local cable system, 
owned by Continental Cablevision, fourth-largest operator of cable systems in 
the country, steps up pressure on the program exclusivity debate in Congress. 
Cable systems want broadcast networks to yield on exclusive contracts with 
local affiliates as long as networks press for non-exclusive access to cable 
program services such as HBO.

MOTOROLA, HITACHI TO SETTLE PATENT FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd., the giant semiconductor makers that have been 
embroiled in a bitter patent fight for 18 months, said Monday that they have 
agreed to settle their dispute out of court over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint announcement, they said they have reached "an agreement in principle 
that will serve as a framework" for a final settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The companies also said they would ask the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington 
to extend its stay of a lower court order that resolved the dispute in a way 
that neither desired. 
</P>
<P>
That lower court order forbids Hitachi and Motorola from selling the 
semiconductors affected by the patent fight. It is considered potentially 
damaging to Motorola because it covers the company's top-selling 
microprocessor, the 68030, the brains of several popular personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
A Hitachi spokesman said his company expects a negotiated settlement in 60 to 
90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies declined to comment on terms of the interim agreement. The two 
former business partners said only that the deal sets the stage for resolution 
of the patent fight that erupted in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said any settlement would probably grant each company access 
to the other's portfolio of patented products and processes. In addition, they 
said, Motorola may agree to pay Hitachi royalty fees for the right to continue 
production of its current design of the 68030. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Motorola is motivated to settle the case rapidly because of the 
potentially disastrous effect the sales ban on the 68030 would pose for it and 
its customers, notably Apple Computer. Apple uses the Motorola chip in all but 
three of its Macintosh personal computers. Analysts said the 68030 
microprocessor generates well over $100 million in annual sales.

EARLY MARKET RALLY FIZZLES; DOW DROPS 12

<P>
Stock prices slipped Monday, adding to Friday's steep loss on selling that was 
inspired by a sharp drop in the Treasury bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 12.13 points to 2,845.05, 
extending last week's 78.71-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 
two to one in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 
1,049 down, 496 up and 460 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the decline was Caterpillar Inc.'s report of sharply lower earnings 
projections for the second quarter. That raised fears that broader corporate 
earnings prospects overall might be weaker than anticipated. Caterpillar 
plunged 5 to 58 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the drop in Caterpillar may have been an overreaction since 
the agricultural equipment company said more than half its second-quarter 
earnings drop was due to problems in Brazil. Still, Tenneco, a competitor, fell 
1 1/2 to 65 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks rose early, with buyers attracted by Friday's steep drop 
of 44.55 points in the Dow. However, the rally stalled against the background 
of a weak bond market, and stock traders lost their taste for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down nearly a full point. Concern that 
the Federal Reserve may not ease credit soon kept the bond market under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said they detected a resumption of profit taking and some 
computer-driven program selling in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
One trader noted that buying was selective, particularly as the end of the 
second quarter approached. "They want IBM, and Philip Morris," he said, ticking 
off blue chips that were firmer. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices started the day higher, but the gains evaporated by midday. Stocks 
meandered in a narrow range for much of the afternoon, tailing lower on 
late-afternoon program selling. 
</P>
<P>
The early advance "was artificial, just as Friday's trading between 3 and 4 
(o'clock) was artificial," said George Pirrone, senior trader at Dreyfus Corp. 
"The bond market turned sour, and consequently, stocks turned sour." 
</P>
<P>
Rao Chalasani, market strategist at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben, said he 
believes that the recent string of big losses in stocks has a lot to do with 
overbuilt expectations about corporate earnings and interest rates. "The market 
was expecting too much, and now it's paying a price." 
</P>
<P>
J. C. Penney said its sales for June were off last year's pace, and an 
investment bank downgraded the company's earnings estimates for 1991 and 1992, 
indicating weakness in the retail economy. 
</P>
<P>
J. C. Penney was off 2 7/8 to 59 7/8, Woolworth fell 7/8 to 32 7/8 and K mart 
was off 3/8 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
Foxboro jumped 12 7/8 to 51. The British company Siebe PLC agreed to acquire 
the company for $52 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume retreated to 133.1 million shares from 172.57 million on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, stocks in Tokyo posted their biggest one-day point fall in 
more than two months. The 225-share Nikkei index was down 570.38 points to 
close at 31,124.19. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices ended higher on the London Stock Exchange, boosted by a healthy 
start on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 20.0 points 
at 2,398.5. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign buying interest and optimism that West German interest rates will not

CREDIT: Bond Prices Fall on Fears of Glut 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, bond prices tumbled and interest rates rose as dealers 
cited worries about a sizable slate of Treasury securities sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond dropped 7/8 point, or $8.75 per $1,000 in face 
amount. Its yield climbed to 8.55% from 8.47% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was described as moderate. 
</P>
<P>
"The decline . . . was mostly because of upcoming supply," said Elliott Platt, 
director of fixed-income research at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities 
Corp. "People are setting up for the auctions." 
</P>
<P>
Those auctions got under way Monday with the Treasury's sale of $17.2 billion 
of new three-month and six-month bills at the highest rates in a month. 
</P>
<P>
The sales continue this week as the Treasury is selling $11.25 billion of 
two-year notes today, $8.25 billion of four-year notes Wednesday and $10.52 
billion of one-year bills Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.313%, up from 8.188% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Ends Mixed as Interest Shifts 
</P>
<P>
The dollar turned in a mixed performance as dealers directed their attention to 
trading other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the movement in the dollar came as a byproduct of trades involving the 
West German mark against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Renewed buying of 
Canadian dollars after a recent slide was another feature of foreign exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of significant economic reports being released this week and the 
onset of month-end investment maneuvers were expected to mute activity in the 
currency markets, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the European holiday season also was expected to restrain currency 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing uncertainty over the economic consequences of German unification put 
pressure on the mark. Concerns have resurfaced as the day of German monetary 
union approaches on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar rebounded modestly from a selloff sparked by the failure of 
the Meech Lake accord, a plan designed to preserve the country's unity by 
recognizing French-speaking Quebec as a "distinct society." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Corn, Soybeans Rise on Weather Report 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts for a Midwestern heat wave helped push corn and soybean futures 
prices up sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that an extended dry 
spell could harm tender young sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures closed narrowly mixed, reflecting perceptions that hot, dry 
weather would benefit the maturing winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced; copper fell; energy 
futures were mixed; livestock futures were mixed, and pork bellies declined the 
daily limit for the third straight day. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 3 cents lower to 0.50 cent 
higher, with the contract for delivery in July at $3.335 a bushel; corn was 
2.50 cents to 8 cents higher, with July at $2.87 a bushel; oats were 3.75 to 
4.50 cents higher, with July at $1.3825 a bushel; soybeans were 12 to 19 cents 
higher, with July at $6.12 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
A high pressure system featuring temperatures in the 90s is expected to edge 
into the western Corn Belt from the Southwest by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the expected heat lasts beyond five days, young plants could be damaged, and 
traders will "start pushing the panic button," Karlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon for these high-pressure systems to become entrenched in an 
area for a fairly long while, eight to 10 days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, you would have dried out the topsoil to an undesirable degree."

CHASE PLANS RESTRUCTURING TO CUT COSTS $300 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's second-largest bank company, which is 
suffering from low earnings, said Monday that it would undertake a 
restructuring aimed at cutting costs by $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that our overall performance improve in the months ahead. 
This is a dual challenge," the company said in a memorandum to top employees. 
</P>
<P>
The memo said the restructuring aims to reduce costs in the near term while 
boosting revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the plan was pushed by chairman-designate Thomas Labrecque, 51, 
named last week as the successor to Chairman Willard C. Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
They said Chase wanted to cut 2,500 to 3,000 jobs through layoffs and attrition 
in the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said the move was in response to a business climate "as difficult as any 
in the history of the global financial services industry." But it gave few 
specifics about where the cost cutting might hit. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the reorganization will likely result in a big one-time charge 
against earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if you saw (a charge) in the area of $100 
million, principally from severance. It's very expensive reducing staff under 
foreign labor laws," said Stephen Berman at County Natwest. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation mounted that Chase would launch its much-needed cost-cutting plan 
when Labrecque's elevation was announced. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is expected to include asset sales and a dramatic slimming of the 
company's diversified investment banking services, ranging from corporate 
finance to foreign exchange and government bond dealing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Chase reported disappointing first-quarter earnings of $44 million, down 67% 
from a year earlier, and increases in nonperforming loans, those on which 
interest payments are late. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings have not been sufficient to even pay for the company's annual 
dividend. While profits in recent years have hit some peaks, for the most part 
they have been disappointing. Chase last year reported a $655-million loss 
because of costs associated with poorly performing loans and restructuring 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Chase, which has 42,000 employees, has already cut about 5,000 jobs since 1987, 
when large losses from reserving for Third World loan losses accelerated the 
need to pare costs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with revenue from lucrative leveraged buyouts, merger and acquisition 
advising and real estate lending drying up, and with mounting losses from 
souring real estate loans, Chase is under the gun to make more cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Chase is not alone in seeking ways to trim expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust New York Corp. just pared its corporate finance department by 75 
people, or by 10%, and analysts expect job reductions at other U.S. banks as 
well.

PERSONAL HEALTH: LINKS BETWEEN CANCER, DIETARY FAT INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans need only look at the Chinese, Japanese and Southern Italians to see 
we eat far too much fat, say authors of several recent studies pointing to the 
strong connection between dietary fat and particular types of cancers. 
</P>
<P>
Dietary fat, fondly found in such goodies as ice cream and avocados, is a 
well-known contributor to heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Now 
evidence is accumulating that it contributes mightily to some cancers, 
particularly breast and colorectal cancer, and, possibly, prostate, pancreatic 
and ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
While physicians know dietary fat increases deposits in blood vessels that 
cause heart disease, much less is known about how fat contributes to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But the mystery hasn't held back health experts from strong recommendations 
that Americans reduce dietary fat -- perhaps even below current recommendation 
of 30% of total daily calories. 
</P>
<P>
"The fat story is real," says Clifford Welsch, a pharmacology and toxicology 
professor at Michigan State University. "There is overwhelming evidence in 
experimental animals that the amount and type of dietary fat markedly affects 
this (cancer) process." 
</P>
<P>
But strong evidence also exists outside the laboratory, health experts note. 
And it's the comparison of diets in other countries that convinces many health 
experts that Americans eat far too much fat. 
</P>
<P>
* A new study cites high-fat diets and lack of exercise for higher rates of 
colorectal cancer in Chinese-Americans compared with Chinese living in China. 
</P>
<P>
* A study in Italy shows two-fold increases in breast cancer rates in Northern 
Italy, where diets are much higher in fat, compared with Southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
* Studies show that Japanese women, who consume less fat, have lower breast 
cancer rates and better breast-cancer survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it comes back to what we ate a million years ago when, probably, we only 
ate 10% of our calories in fat and ate 50 to 80 grams of fiber a day and when 
we exercised a lot," says Dr. Ernst L. Wynder, president of the American Health 
Foundation, a private research group. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation estimates that half of all cancers in women and a third of all 
cancers in men are related to dietary fat. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the major cause of disease is excessive exposure" to fat, Wynder 
says. "When it comes to fat, I believe our system was not developed to handle 
100 grams of fat a day." 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans consume about 40% of their daily calories from fat. Health 
experts generally agree that fat should be limited to 30% of total daily 
calories. The health foundation, however, has taken a more extreme view, 
suggesting that fat should make up 25% or less of the daily diet. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging studies are important in part because the cancers that appear to 
be influenced by dietary fat are major problems in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other than common skin cancers, the incidence of colorectal cancer ranks second 
only to lung cancer in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates 
that 155,000 new cases will be reported this year. Breast cancer affects about 
one in every 10 women. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are well aware of the role of dietary fat and heart disease, 
but the data haven't been as strong with dietary fat and cancer," says Stanford 
epidemiologist Alice Whittemore, co-author of a five-year study of Chinese 
populations. "I think that's changing, though. The data are beginning to come 
in quite conclusively, on large bowel cancers, that fat is an important factor. 
I think this is an important public-health message." 
</P>
<P>
A rate of colorectal cancer four to five times higher among Chinese-Americans 
than among Chinese living in China can be strongly linked to a diet high in 
saturated fats and a sedentary lifestyle, Whittemore's group at Stanford and 
researchers at the University of Southern California reported in a study 
published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise is thought to help reduce incidence of cancer by speeding by the 
movement of food through the intestinal tract. 
</P>
<P>
"The two factors -- high saturated-fat diet and lack of exercise -- are working 
together to be harmful," Whittemore says. "I believe that this is a message 
everyone needs to hear, not just the Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
Studies comparing the rate of breast cancer in other countries are equally 
compelling, Wynder says. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the comparison of breast cancer rates in Italy, other studies show that 
Japanese women, who consume less fat, have lower rates of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The link between dietary fat and breast cancer is strong enough that 
researchers now are studying whether breast cancer patients might have better 
survival rates if they adopt lower-fat diets. 
</P>
<P>
Wynder says studies have shown that Japanese women who do develop breast cancer 
have much better survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
A leading theory about breast-cancer development holds that increases in the 
hormone estrogen contributes to cancer. Dietary fat raises estrogen levels. 
Hormones are thought to play a role in other cancers as well. 
</P>
<P>
"A new approach to cancer treatment is 'Can you treat cancer with a low-fat 
diet?' " Wynder says. "In my opinion, dietary fat not only plays a role in the 
promotion of breast cancer but also in terms of metastasis." 
</P>
<P>
A study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is under way at seven 
institutions to explore whether post-menopausal women who have been treated for 
breast cancer have better survival rates when they consume a diet of less than 
20% fat. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly a worthwhile trial," Wynder says. "And one thing you can say 
about nutrition: It's not toxic. It's not costly at all. And almost anyone can 
do it. The women who are on the trial are complying with the diet very well. My 
own hunch is it will not only work for cancer in the breast but also work for 
other hormone-related cancers, particularly cancer of the prostrate and 
possibly ovary and endometrian. It certainly doesn't relate to all cancers." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from 20 patients in the study show a 60% drop in a 
particular type of estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
Wynder, one of the strongest advocates for nutritional changes to reduce cancer 
rates, says it was tough convincing his peers that such a study was of value: 
"When it comes to nutrition to treat breast cancer, people says it's hokey. 
I've had a difficult time convincing my colleagues that nutrition could be part 
of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
But others caution that it's too soon to implicate diet as a major factor in 
the development of some cancers. One of the most comprehensive recent studies 
on diet and breast cancer in nurses, for example, showed no relationship. The 
study has been criticized, however, because the nurses were consuming diets of 
32% to 44% fat, thought by some experts to be too high to make a difference in 
breast cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
Others suggest that while diets may help prevent cancer, many factors 
contribute to cancer development and survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a difference in the way an individual responds," says Paul 
Newberne of the Mallory Institute of Pathology in Boston. "Overall, I think 
nutrition is going to help us prevent cancer . . . rather than cure it. And I 
don't think we should try to oversell something to the public that we can't 
really deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree they must learn more about what is in fat that could contribute 
to cancer. Some researchers suggest saturated fat is the culprit; others say 
calories in fat are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole array of ideas as to how fat might enhance (cancer) 
processes, but we don't know definitively which of these are the most 
important," says Michigan State's Welsch. "I feel that the major impact from 
dietary fat happens to be the calories derived from fat." 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that those with colorectal cancer generally consume more 
calories than healthy people. 
</P>
<P>
But the Stanford-USC study was among the first to strongly implicate saturated 
fat as a contributor to colorectal cancer. Because of variations in Chinese 
diets, researchers were able to link saturated fat to higher rates of 
colorectal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the strongest association we've seen that unequivocally pulled out 
saturated fat as the culprit," Whittemore says. Other studies soon to be 
released will support the relationship, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whittemore also suggests that the new evidence might lead health officials to 
recommend further reductions in dietary fat, under 30% of total calories. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that those with the lowest risk among the Chinese had only consumed 
about 10 grams of saturated fat per day, about 100 calories," Whittemore says. 
"It could well be that we should cut down even more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REDUCING DIETARY FAT 
</P>
<P>
* Choose lean meat, fish, poultry and dry beans and peas as protein sources. 
</P>
<P>
* Use skim or low-fat milk and milk products. 
</P>
<P>
* Moderate use of egg yolks and organ meats. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit intake of fats and oils, especially those high in saturated fat, such 
as butter, cream, lard, heavily hydrogenated fats (some margarines), 
shortenings and foods containing palm and coconut oils. 
</P>
<P>
* Trim fat off meats. 
</P>
<P>
* Broil, bake or boil rather than fry. 
</P>
<P>
* Moderate use of foods that contain fat, such as breaded and deep-fried foods. 
</P>
<P>
* Read labels carefully to determine both amount and type of fat present in 
foods.

YOUR BODY: PLAN AHEAD TO HELP ENSURE YOU HAVE A HAPPY CAMPER 
</P>

<P>
Very soon, the exodus begins. About 5 million U.S. children will pack their 
little suitcases and head for summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
Off they go to more than 8,500 day and residential camps to make new friends, 
eat gooey marshmallows and gather anecdotes for next fall's school essays. 
</P>
<P>
What can parents do before their offspring leave to be sure they are healthy as 
well as happy campers? 
</P>
<P>
First, check out the camp, says the American Academy of Pediatrics. Ideally, 
every camp should have a staff nurse and a physician who is not only on call, 
but also a regular visitor. All camp counselors should be trained in first aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure your children's immunizations are up-to-date before they leave" -- and 
that includes tetanus shots, said Dr. Loraine Stern, a Los Angeles-area 
pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
"Pack sunscreen and tell them how to use it. Put some insect repellent in their 
suitcases, too. Stick to lotion or stick form. I don't trust kids with sprays," 
said Stern. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should also be certain their children are psychologically ready for 
camp. Most boys and girls are ready to go to day camp at age 6 or 7 and 
residential camp at age 9 or 10, although experts say readiness varies from 
child to child. 
</P>
<P>
Children who enjoy class trips, invite friends to sleep over at their homes and 
who respond positively to adult supervision seem to do best at summer camps. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can build emotional readiness if it seems to be lacking. "Be supportive 
and tell the child you are proud he or she is becoming independent," said Karol 
Fishler, a clinical psychologist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. "Once the 
child is at camp, send a post card or two. Think about sending one ahead of 
time, so it will be there when the camper arrives." 
</P>
<P>
"If children are age 8 or younger, pack a familiar object like a teddy bear," 
suggested Stern. "If they are embarrassed, they can always keep it hidden in 
the suitcase." Family pictures, tucked into a suitcase, might also quell 
feelings of homesickness, she said. Kids who are adamantly opposed to going to 
camp probably are not ready for the experience, experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Summer camps should be viewed as more than a vacation. The best camp programs 
help children gain a broader perspective of life, become less self-centered and 
develop special skills such as art and mathematics, say psychologists.

</P>
<P>
Among the most outspoken supporters of European integration, the Italians will 
lay the groundwork for two key meetings at the end of this year in Rome: one to 
finalize plans for economic and monetary union among the community's 12 member 
states, and the other to discuss concrete steps toward eventual political 
union. 
</P>
<P>
During Italy's presidency, the government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti 
will also seek to convince its European allies to pledge 1% of their gross 
national products to aid development in Eastern Europe and the Third World.

Last month, when the Bush Administration was ready to make public its decision 
to extend China's most-favored-nation trade benefits, the announcement was 
suddenly postponed for two days. According to Washington insiders, the reason 
for the last-minute delay was that White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu 
wanted to carefully scrutinize the decision, its implications and the wording 
of President Bush's statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, it is said here, is becoming an increasingly active and influential 
figure on China issues. There have been reports that China's ambassador to 
Washington, Zhu Qizhen, began meeting directly with Sununu in the weeks leading 
up to the Administration's decision on the trade benefits. The White House 
refuses to comment on these reports. "I don't know whether he did, and I don't 
know that he didn't," a White House spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu's performance shows how the Bush Administration is changing subtly in 
the way it makes policy toward China. 
</P>
<P>
Who calls the shots? The short answer is simple: Ultimately, Bush himself does. 
No one can accuse the President of shirking responsibility. Ever since the 
Chinese regime dispatched the tanks to clear out pro-democracy demonstrators 
from Tian An Men Square a year ago, Bush has made plain his own personal desire 
to reconcile with the Chinese leadership. Among China hands, Bush is sometimes 
nicknamed "the desk officer in the White House." (A desk officer is a 
low-ranking State Department official who handles the day-to-day details of 
U.S. policy toward a particular country.) 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that as Bush assumes the role of China desk officer, the other 
top members of his foreign policy team begin to bow out. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has made it plain that he does not want 
to stake his personal prestige on China or be too closely involved in the 
policy making. Baker spends his time on the Soviet Union, Germany and, at 
times, the Mideast and Japan; when it comes to China, Baker often notes loyally 
that the policy is the President's. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of 
State Lawrence S. Eagleburger were heavily involved in making decisions on 
China. The two men, both former aides to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger 
during the Nixon Administration's opening to China, made secretly planned trips 
to Beijing on Bush's behalf last July and December. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington insiders say the firestorm raised in the United States by those 
trips, and the disappointing results from them, have made both men defensive 
about their performance and leery of too much involvement in new initiatives 
toward the Chinese leadership. "I'm certain Brent and Larry both feel singed by 
their experience (on the trips to Beijing)," says one Washington insider. "The 
Kissinger-Scowcroft-Eagleburger connection has become less useful to the 
Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Scowcroft met at the White House with Chai Ling, the 
now-exiled Chinese student who was among the leaders of the democracy 
protesters in Tian An Men Square last year. Outraged, the Chinese Embassy in 
Washington branded Chai a "criminal" and protested the Bush Administration's 
extension of a red carpet for her. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush's foreign policy advisers distance themselves from China policy, Sununu 
becomes increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, this should not be too surprising. Sununu is Bush's top 
political adviser, and Roger W. Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business 
Council, observes that "China has become very much a domestic political issue." 
</P>
<P>
In the debate over whether to extend most-favored-nation status for Beijing, 
some past critics of the Administration's China policy refrained from calling 
for a revocation of these trade benefits, which help American businesses. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) avoided taking any position for 
weeks. Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), head of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee's Asia subcommittee, and former U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord 
called for extending the benefits, but attaching some new conditions to them 
that would require improvements in China's human rights situation. On the GOP 
right, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) stayed away from the controversy over trade 
benefits, concentrating instead on an effort to keep goods produced in Chinese 
prisons out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the opposition to extending the trade benefits was spearheaded by Sen. 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), the Senate majority leader, and others in the 
Democratic Party leadership. The Democrats have discovered that Bush may be 
vulnerable on China and thus have stepped up their partisan attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu has become important in part because he needs to help out in the 
political defense of his boss. Insiders say that when Sununu first looked at 
the issue of extending U.S. trade benefits to China, he branded it a "loser" 
for the Administration and questioned the wisdom of doing it. Eventually, he 
came around and worked to minimize the political fallout. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu's new involvement in China policy could also mean something else. For 
nearly two decades, Chinese leaders have skillfully courted each Administration 
by establishing close personal ties with an individual whose views and 
positions would be favorable to them. The Chinese regime then tends to use this 
person as the conduit for high-level messages from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
During the Nixon Administration, the Chinese chose Kissinger, then the national 
security adviser, over Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Under President 
Jimmy Carter, the Chinese elected to work closely with National Security 
Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski instead of Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance. And 
in the early days of the Reagan Administration, the Chinese sought to establish 
Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. as the main link for U.S.-China 
relations, rather than National Security Adviser Richard Allen. 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. policy toward China becomes increasingly politicized, Sununu may now be 
emerging as the Chinese regime's new pipeline into Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Communist Party, which has governed the Soviet Union since the Bolshevik 
Revolution in 1917, remains on paper the country's ruling party. Its leader, 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is the country's president. Its members form the majority 
of the national Parliament. Only one minister in the central government is not 
a party member. 
</P>
<P>
True, the Communists lost power to new nationalist movements during elections 
this spring in the Baltic republics, and the governing councils of the 
country's two largest cities, Moscow and Leningrad, are now in the hands of 
dissident Communists and non-party members with programs of radical reform. 
</P>
<P>
But no one doubts that the decisions that the party will make at its 28th 
national congress starting next Monday will shape the future of the Soviet 
Union and that political initiative in the country still lies largely with the 
party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The weight of the party is still great and undeniable, and that is why it is 
worth fighting over where it stands and what it does," Vyacheslav N. 
Shostakovsky, rector of the Moscow Higher Party School and the chairman of 
Democratic Platform, said as he argued for the group's participation in the 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The party still holds power -- sometimes unjustly, sometimes passively, 
sometimes malevolently, sometimes negligently . . . . With that power comes the 
potential to change Soviet society, to transform the economy, to reform the 
political system, to do so many things that need to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, this is not the power that the Communist Party once wielded -- and it is 
nowhere near "the party of militant revolutionaries" that it had proclaimed 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Its membership, now just over 18 million, is declining with three to four times 
more people quitting than joining the party in most areas of the country. Soon, 
fewer than one in 10 workers will be party members, according to recent 
projections; a decade ago, the party's goal was one in five. 
</P>
<P>
The party's popular prestige has dropped to the point where far more people 
trust the Russian Orthodox Church; 47.9% of those surveyed in May by the Center 
for the Study of Public Opinion expressed "full trust" in the church compared 
to 29.5% for the party. And 26% said they had no trust at all in the party, 
even though it had governed the country for three generations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, party members themselves are so divided over perestroika, the reform 
program launched five years ago by Gorbachev, that the same institution that 
used to boast of its political discipline and "monolithic Leninism" appears 
likely to split after the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Radical reformers belonging to the Democratic Platform have already warned that 
they plan to break away if their reforms are not adopted, and some 
conservatives believe that they, too, should leave in order to uphold 
traditional Marxist-Leninist values. 
</P>
<P>
Such a split, although it would be the first since the time of V. I. Lenin, the 
Bolshevik leader, would diminish the party's ranks only slightly; more members 
are leaving through apathy or because membership is no longer required for 
their jobs than would quit over ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there an early prospect of the party's being replaced by a rival, as 
happened in many East European countries. For more than 70 years, the Communist 
Party has been the only political organization allowed in the Soviet Union, and 
there simply are no real challengers except nationalist movements in the 
smaller republics. 
</P>
<P>
A more serious danger might arise in the future, some Soviet analysts have 
speculated, if the party lost all authority and the country drifted into 
anarchy, an old Russian preoccupation. 
</P>
<P>
"The priests turn heretics -- that is the great fear in any religion," 
Shostakovsky remarked in an interview. "When we political 'theologians' reverse 
our positions and say, 'This, not that, must be done, and this is forbidden but 
that is good,' doubt is introduced, the faith is weakened and orthodoxy is 
greatly diminished." 
</P>
<P>
This soul-searching is largely the result of the country's multiple crises and 
the freedom that glasnost, or the new political openness here, has given people 
to think about solutions. But it has left even the party's leaders disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to define the Communist ideal, one of the party's chief ideologists, 
Alexander S. Kapto, said this month that, "stripped of dogmatism, (it) 
incorporates all the fundamental humanitarian ideas evolved in the course of 
history and reflects the fundamental human aspiration to happiness and a better 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Kapto might have been preaching at a nondenominational church service. He made 
no mention of the classless society of the future, nor of class struggle, the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, public ownership of the means of production or 
the other ideological pillars around which the Soviet Union was built. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment has come for the total de-ideologization, de-Communization of the 
country, and it is already happening in practical terms," Alexander Tsipko, a 
leading political philosopher, said in an interview. "When Mikhail Gorbachev 
speaks, and when he talks sense, it has no relationship to Marxism-Leninism. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"But where does that leave the party? It leaves it as an organization whose 
cause, whose raison d'etre, no longer seems relevant or even valid." 
</P>
<P>
The largest factor, however, in what is now a full-scale crisis of confidence 
is the great uncertainty over the party's day-to-day role. 
</P>
<P>
The organization that, up to two years ago, ran everything -- the whole Soviet 
government from top to bottom, the world's second largest economy, the armed 
forces and nuclear arsenal of a superpower, the daily lives of more than 285 
million people -- has been deliberately cut back, its authority reduced and its 
officials told to stick to political work. 
</P>
<P>
There are two sides to this question, one of the most important in the Soviet 
Union, and the issue is far from resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Most managers were quick to praise the initial decision to pull the party out 
of its day-to-day role, for this gave them new freedom to operate their 
factories and run their offices without interference from an ubiquitous and 
meddling party committee, often made up largely of professional party workers. 
</P>
<P>
Many later found, however, that the party professionals had the necessary 
connections to obtain supplies, the authority to hire new workers and ways to 
get bank loans or foreign currency allocations that they lacked. The party's 
decision to give up its monopoly on power and step back from daily operations 
had, in fact, left a vacuum at every level of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is willing to sign anything, to make a decision, to do anything," the 
frustrated manager of a Moscow construction company, a cooperative enterprise, 
said, complaining about what it now takes to get a building permit. "Those who 
are willing, it eventually turns out, either lack the authority or the money or 
materials to follow through." 
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon affects health care, schooling, cultural activities, the news 
media and even neighborhood youth groups. Where there had been party 
committees, each interpreting the decrees of the Kremlin in its local 
conditions, government officials or private citizens are starting to take 
charge, but without the connections or the experience and with uncertain 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
The result, say conservatives, has been chaos -- the near collapse of the 
economic system, political paralysis at virtually all levels, social discontent 
on a growing and dangerous scale. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going through an extremely dangerous period now," Yegor K. Ligachev, 
the foremost conservative in the party leadership, told a farmers' conference 
here this month. "Our party and our state are facing a great threat, and our 
Soviet federation is being torn to pieces. If we continue to make one 
concession after another, we may lose everything." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ligachev disagrees with many of Gorbachev's reforms, believing that 
they were not well thought out and have been poorly executed, he is most 
concerned about the decline of the party, its internal confusion and loss of 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation is now like a giant, all of whose tendons have been cut and who 
can't raise his arms or his legs or even raise his head," Anatoly S. Salutsky, 
a conservative political commentator, observed at the start of a Russian 
Communist Party conference here last week. "In our organism, those tendons were 
the party. The party linked all the distant parts to the center, it executed 
the decisions that were made, it ensured a functioning of the economy.. . . 
Now, nothing works." 
</P>
<P>
Even Gorbachev's supporters are critical. "We have destroyed the mechanism of 
managing our economy, and we have not set up a new one," Yuri A. Prokofiev, the 
first secretary of the Moscow party organization, the country's largest, said 
at the conference, tartly summing up one result of the changing party role. 
</P>
<P>
Another regional party leader, voicing a common criticism of the reforms, said, 
"We are like the boy who sees an old clock, one that is not keeping time very 
well, and who then takes it apart. What we have now are a handful of springs 
and wheels and screws and no idea of how to put them together again." 
</P>
<P>
This self-doubt is sapping the party's strength even further, Gorbachev 
acknowledged last week, and the shape of the party, as much as its policies, 
must be the focus of the congress. "People are inquiring with anxiety -- what 
is happening with the party, where is it going, what will it look like?" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, in a preview of the congress, declared his intention to proceed 
with the restructuring of the party, not the return to the old Leninist system 
of a ruling party that took charge of everything in the name of the country's 
workers and peasants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved what the most progressive people of our country have for 
decades been striving for," he asserted, reaffirming the changes of the past 
year. "The party has decided not to assume the functions of the state any 
longer. The division of power is now actual fact. Elections have become truly 
free. We are actually on the threshold of true political pluralism. The notion 
of 'social democracy' is no longer a mere propaganda phrase." 
</P>
<P>
The new party platform and party rules, Gorbachev said, would bring further 
changes, both in the party's relations with society and in its internal 
structures. "The Communist Party will be turned from an administrative body 
imposing its will on society into a political organization that will uphold its 
right to political leadership in free competition with other socio-political 
forces," he added. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean renouncing the nomenklatura system, a key instrument of 
political control, that reserves jobs for party members and through which the 
party leadership appoints officials at lower levels. Party officials would in 
the future be elected on the basis of competitive nominations and secret 
ballots. And party members would be allowed to express dissenting views and 
challenge the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the country's problems depends on first reorienting the party, 
said Veniamin A. Yarin, a steelworker with a wide populist following who now 
sits on the Presidential Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The party must determine its role in society," Yarin said in an interview. 
"Either it continues to be a tool for those who want to pressure society, or 
its leadership must be assumed by men who will turn the party to human needs. 
That is what always has been lacking in the party -- attention to human needs." 
</P>
<P>
Prokofiev, the Moscow party leader, made a similar point. "The future of the 
party is broad, sweeping democracy," he told newsmen. "That is the only way to 
attract the popular masses." 
</P>
<P>
On the State of The Party: 
</P>
<P>
BORIS N. YELTSIN, 59 
</P>
<P>
President of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic 
</P>
<P>
"The party apparatus is extremely bureaucratic. People hold onto their seats 
with such tenacity, you can't get rid of them unless you catapult them together 
with the seats out of the picture altogether." 
</P>
<P>
"There must be no monopoly of power. Down with the Communists!" 
</P>
<P>
ALEXANDER N. YAKOVLEV, 66 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Communist Party Politburo member 
</P>
<P>
"For there to be a multi-party system, there must be other parties. We in the 
Communist Party don't see any reason to establish an opposition to ourselves, 
but as a result of the democratic process other parties will emerge and will 
compete for seats in parliament. I hope we will be ready." 
</P>
<P>
YEGOR K. LIGACHEV, 69 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Communist Party Politburo member 
</P>
<P>
"We are going through an extremely dangerous period now. Our party and our 
state are facing a great threat, and our Soviet federation is being torn to 
pieces. If we continue to make one concession after another, we may lose 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
YURI A. PROKOFIEV, 51 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Communist Party first secretary in Moscow: 
</P>
<P>
"The party is a unique mechanism of state government. It is now, only now, 
evolving into a political organization, but a lot of comrades don't understand 
and want to return to the old command-administrative system." 
</P>
<P>
MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV, 59 
</P>
<P>
President and Soviet Communist Party general secretary: 
</P>
<P>
"People are inquiring with anxiety -- what is happening with the party, where 
is it going, what will it look like?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party will be turned from an administrative body, imposing its 
will on society, into a political organization that will uphold its right to 
political leadership in free competition with other socio-political forces."

DOING BUSINESS IN THESE BALKANS: ROCK BOTTOM COST . . .AND QUALITY;

FOREIGN PARTNERS. THEY ALSO OFFER ETHNIC STRIFE AND A QUESTIONABLE WORK ETHIC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Balkan nations of Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria, the work force is 
plentiful, the markets are wide open and the cost of doing business is 
rock-bottom. But in a region whose name has become synonymous with slovenly 
work and ethnic strife, Western investors are best advised to be careful they 
don't get what they've paid for. 
</P>
<P>
Business people flocking to Eastern Europe in search of the perfect deal have 
mostly focused on the rapidly democratizing states to the north, like Hungary 
and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of being overlooked in the regionwide gold rush has encouraged Balkan 
states to offer comparatively attractive conditions, like tax holidays and 
fewer limits on what foreign partners can own. 
</P>
<P>
The mountainous states flanked by the Adriatic and Black seas have in common a 
desire for reform and Western integration. But the similarities end there, as 
each has distinctive pluses and considerable minuses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yugoslavia, a Communist renegade of long standing, has the most experience 
with Western business. It began tinkering with its planned economy in 1967. It 
has also shown remarkable progress in recent months, taming four-digit 
hyperinflation and introducing Eastern Europe's first convertible currency. Its 
biggest detraction is recurring ethnic unrest that has led to strikes, boycotts 
and a threat of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Romania's chief asset is the virtual absence of a foreign debt, which the 
late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu erased with a Draconian austerity program that 
virtually starved the nation. While new leaders say they are eager for Western 
partnership, the country's political instability should be an overriding 
consideration for those contemplating investment. The brutal clash between pro- 
and anti-government forces in Bucharest in mid-June was likely a harbinger of 
worse times to come. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bulgaria, the last of the true believers in communism's capacity for 
self-correction, has oddly emerged from the season of free elections with the 
greatest degree of political and ethnic stability in the Balkans. Reform 
Communists steering the government have also created favorable conditions for 
foreigners, including free-trade zones with no taxes or limits on the amount of 
hard-currency earnings that can be taken out of the country. On the down side, 
Bulgaria's industrial output has been slipping, it has a colossal foreign debt 
of $10 billion, and the traditional market for its goods -- the Soviet Union -- 
has dried up due to that nation's own economic traumas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Poverty and economic crisis are among the few factors that bind the Balkan 
states in these days of emerging individualism. Industrial output has been 
falling in all three states -- in Yugoslavia by design, as the cost of bringing 
down inflation -- and per capita income is a fraction of West Europeans'. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest financial institution, estimates that 
Bulgarians and Yugoslavs have 45% of the purchasing power of their Western 
neighbors, and Romanians only 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Because investment opportunities are gauged by purchasing power instead of 
market size, the attraction for Balkan projects is limited despite a population 
of 56 million consumers and deficits of every product from bread to baling 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
Holding out more promise are joint ventures that produce goods for export or 
services that can be sold for hard-currency consumption on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton Sofia Hotel Balkan trades the Boston-based chain's reputation, 
training and management skills for a share of the steadily improving income. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheraton hasn't had to put any money into the country. We are giving them our 
expertise," said Flemming Jensen, general manager of the 200-room showcase of 
Western efficiency in a region renowned for bad service. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said Western bankers and business people have been flocking to Bulgaria 
to search out new opportunities. Most are optimistic about the long run, he 
said, but have been discouraged by the government's March suspension of payment 
on foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign companies are concerned now because they can't buy property," observed 
Rumen Gechev, a professor of macroeconomics at Sofia's Institute of Economics. 
"But the laws are changing and investors should be attracted by the more 
favorable opportunities to lease land and facilities, which in many ways 
reduces their risks." 
</P>
<P>
Gechev said that Bulgaria, which will likely retain at least 50% state 
ownership as it pursues a moderate economic reform course, recently leased 
500,000 acres of farmland to Israel for a cotton-growing project. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Romanian officials likewise have been pushing leasing deals to avoid selling 
out the nation's best assets, like white-sand beaches along the Black Sea. But 
internal conflict is costing them foreign trust, most notably in tourism, which 
has seen an 80% drop in bookings this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a normal human reaction that one doesn't come here under the 
circumstances. The whole world was watching what happened in Romania," Ion 
Nichita, spokesman for the Litoral travel network, said even before the most 
recent wave of violence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's well-developed tourist industry has benefited from new foreign 
investments spurred by reforms introduced last December by Prime Minister Ante 
Markovic. 
</P>
<P>
Desimir Guzina, director of the federal Institute for Social Planning, boasts 
that 10,200 new firms opened in the first five months of this year, many with 
the aid of foreign partners. Encouraged by more lenient conditions for doing 
business, Western companies have concluded more contracts with Yugoslav firms 
in the last 18 months than over the previous 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Faith is there with the foreign partners, although some reservations due to 
political conflicts are apparent in the amounts being invested," Guzina said of 
the primarily small projects. 
</P>
<P>
One has only to look at the relations among Yugoslavia's six republics and two 
provinces to get nervous about the federation's future. Differences between 
Slovenia, the richest republic, and Serbia, the largest, led to an economic 
boycott earlier this year that inflicted considerable damage on both sides. And 
smoldering ethnic hostilities in Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian 
province under Serbian rule, has Yugoslavs as well as foreigners watching

IMELDA MARCOS CALLED FORCE BEHIND FRAUDS

Imelda Marcos was "the driving force" behind fraudulent art and real estate 
transactions that were typically "done in the shadows . . . because she knew 
that what she was doing was wrong," Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles LaBella said 
Monday in his final arguments to jurors hearing the federal fraud and 
racketeering case against the former Philippine first lady. 
</P>
<P>
Through nearly five hours of alternately passionate rhetoric and tedious 
recitation of evidence, LaBella also accused the widow of deposed dictator 
Ferdinand E. Marcos of orchestrating secret investment schemes with stolen 
public funds on such a grand scale that it finally staggered the Philippine 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging defense assertions that Mrs. Marcos was "just a wife" who didn't 
know much about how her husband acquired the money she spent, the chief 
prosecutor scoffed that "of course she knew." 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't just an outside observer who had things happening around her that 
she didn't know about," LaBella argued. "Imelda Marcos was not in a glass tomb. 
. . . She was in the thick of things." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mrs. Marcos had to know "dirty money" was involved because she knew how 
much money she and President Marcos earned, a very modest amount compared to 
the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on real estate, jewelry and art. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gerry Spence was scheduled to give closing arguments for Mrs. Marcos 
today. Arguments on behalf of co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi are scheduled 
Wednesday morning.

More than 7,000 King penguins, most of them chicks, were crushed to death on a 
remote Tasmanian island south of Australia in an apparent mass panic, wildlife 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said they are still unsure about the cause of the incident, which 
occurred about two weeks ago on Macquarie Island, a 67-square-mile nature 
reserve. The dead birds were piled up four deep when found a few days ago by 
wildlife officials, who likened the stampede to a crowd at a sports stadium.

DANNEMEYER SCORNS MANDELA VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer on Monday denounced Nelson Mandela's scheduled 
appearance before Congress today as "a national disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's "longstanding support for such luminaries of freedom as Fidel Castro, 
Yasser Arafat and the Libyan loony Moammar Kadafi" makes him an inappropriate 
guest to speak before a joint meeting of Congress, Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) 
said in a one-minute speech on the House floor before business hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The invitation alone heaps shame on this body (Congress)," Dannemeyer said. 
"Nelson Mandela is no Martin Luther King. . . . Mandela should be condemned." 
</P>
<P>
During a television appearance on ABC-TV's "Nightline," aired Thursday, Mandela 
defended his ties with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Arafat, 
Libyan leader Kadafi and Cuban President Castro, all of whom supported his 
African National Congress "to the hilt."

SOCKERS PRESENT 'FINAL' PROPOSAL ON LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler presented what he called his final proposal Monday for 
a new lease with San Diego Sports Arena operator Harry Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said if a satisfactory agreement is not reached within the next 10 days, 
he will either sell or fold the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Since Cooper secured an International Hockey League team for San Diego 1 1/2 
weeks ago, Cooper has said the Sockers will have to give up some office space 
in the Sports Arena. Also, there is a chance the Sockers will lose some prime 
weekend scheduling dates. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling on any of the issues is that until we have an agreement on 
everything, we have an agreement on nothing," said Fowler, whose team lost 
approximately $500,000 last season. "The bottom line is, I'm not looking for 
our cost to go up because of an IHL team. If they want us to move, then they 
have to provide us with an office, or the cost incurred making the move. That's 
the major issue right now." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he wants the Sockers to vacate all but 800-square feet of the 
Sports Arena office area. Under his plan, the hockey team's staff would occupy 
about 2,000-square feet. Cooper said the Sockers' switchboard and ticket staff 
would remain in the Sports Arena, but the sales staff would move into a 
building across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler disagreed, saying that he estimated Cooper wants to relegate the Sockers 
to about "300-400-square feet" of office space in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Cooper said he has offered to increase his subsidy to the Sockers for 
staffing to $5,000 a game from $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"To compensate him," Cooper said. "That will wipe me out of the revenue I get 
from parking and concessions, and I still have to operate the building. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never satisfied. He wants me to lose money on it." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler also disagreed with this. He said that the Sockers negotiated a 
reduction in their expenses per game to $10,500 from $13,500 -- the $3,000 
Cooper spoke of -- but said it was based on a sliding attendance scale and that 
the Sockers didn't realize a full $3,000 savings per game. And, he said, the 
extra $2,000 per game is also on the sliding attendance scale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to have parts of this negotiation in print, but if the facts are 
going to be in print, we're going to make sure the facts are accurate," Fowler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said the Sockers will not go forward with their marketing or sell season 
tickets until the issue is resolved. He said he will give Cooper 48 hours to 
reply to his proposal and, if no agreement is reached, will look to sell the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone else wants to go forward with the Sockers, I would make them 
available," Fowler said. "I'm tired of this process. Every time we step 
forward, things out of our control frustrate us. . . . Because of the question 
of arena dates and the need to go out and rent office space without anything 
mitigating that, we're looking at the cost (of operating) going up instead of 
going down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking to do anything to stop the Sockers from playing, but it may be 
that someone else will have to do it. I love the players and I love the fans, 
but the cards are stacked against us. What's the song? You've got to know when 
to fold 'em. That's rapidly approaching." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler was supposed to have filed a letter of credit with the MISL office by 
last Friday, but he said he informed Commissioner Earl Foreman that he would 
not be doing so until the arena situation is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
And if it isn't? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the people will like a minor league hockey team over an eight-time 
indoor champion soccer team," Fowler said. "I think it's a damn shame, the 
whole issue. I'm still totally frustrated with the way it has been handled. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in business, but they've got no coach, no anything. I just find it 
somewhat humorous. Black humor." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler also said he is unhappy over a report that Vin Ciruzzi, a co-owner of 
the Sports Arena lease with Cooper, said the arena has given the Sockers $1.5 
million over the past five years for payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent strongly his implication that they have covered payroll," Fowler 
said. "As long as I've been here, we've covered our own. There may have been an 
incestuous relationship before, but there sure as hell hasn't since I've owned 
the club. I don't know where that crap is coming from. I don't care what 
happened before -- (former owner) Bob Bell hung us all out to dry." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder-forward Branko Segota and goalkeeper Victor Nogueira are the only 
two Sockers signed for next season, and owner Ron Fowler said he will not 
negotiate with anybody else until the Sports Arena deal is done. If things do 
work out, he said he does not anticipate contract problems. "I think we will 
have all of our major players back," Fowler said. "They want to be back and we 
want them back."

PACKAGING: TRANSPORTING FRAGILE GOODS BECOMES EASIER WITH INVENTOR'S SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Packaging designer Herb Ridgeway of San Diego faced a difficult task when an 
electronics firm asked him in late 1987 to design a package to ship fragile 
components. The components contained protruding metal "pins" that would bend 
under their own weight and be damaged when shipped by conventional methods of 
packaging using cardboard, plastic and foam. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway, owner of San Diego-based Concepts in Packaging, a company that 
designs and manufactures industrial packaging, knew he had to try something 
unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
So he fashioned a clam-like cardboard package, with the middle cut out of each 
side, and replaced the cut-out portion with a thin, plastic film "window." The 
plastic film encased the delicate electronic components on the top and bottom 
when the cardboard was folded. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic film punctured under pressure instead of breaking the pins as other 
plastics had, and the sturdy cardboard ends of the package formed a plane to 
protect the cell-like interior. The plane was then inserted into a box for 
shipment. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a package that allowed delicate products to essentially "float" 
while suspended in place inside a box was virtually immune to shocks that would 
cause damage with other packaging methods. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked away in a small, 6,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Southeast San 
Diego, Ridgeway's company is quietly revolutionizing the packaging industry 
with the design concept, which he patented in 1989 under the name of "Korrvu 
Packaging System." 
</P>
<P>
The technique, which since has been licensed to four other packaging concerns, 
could eventually replace many types of foam, including Styrofoam, as the most 
common method used by the packaging industry, various industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Concepts in Packaging posted sales of $995,000 in 1989, up from $565,000 in 
1988. And so far this year, Concepts in Packaging's sales are up 30% from the 
same period last year, Ridgeway said. The four independent licensees of the 
Korrvu system had combined sales of $1 million last year, Ridgeway said. 
</P>
<P>
Concepts in Packaging now occupies a small niche in packaging, which overall 
was a $16.2-billion industry last year, said Henry Deluga, program manager for 
the Fibre Box Assn., a Rolling Meadows, Ill.-based trade association of 
cardboard manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 95% of all manufactured goods and agricultural products are shipped in 
cardboard boxes, known as "corrugated" to those in the industry, Deluga said. 
</P>
<P>
Concepts in Packaging, in addition to its patented "window" design, 
manufactures the interior components of cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Herb (Ridgeway) has a product that, within a matter of time, 
could be quite revolutionary," said Donnetta Peachy, a spokeswoman for GHI 
Systems, a San Pedro-based instrumentation manufacturer whose customers include 
several packagers. GHI Systems makes instruments that manufacturers use to test 
a product's fragility and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
The Korrvu system is "not like anything that we're used to," Peachy said. "I 
think (Concepts in Packaging) has great potential. I think it would probably be 
profitable for any manufacturer to look into what (Concepts) is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway has developed a variety of uses for the method, which he said has 
almost unlimited applications. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost as soon as I saw the concept, as soon as I hit on it, I realized that, 
'Hey, there was a lot of potential here,' " he said. "We're at the same stage 
molded foam was 30 years ago when it first came out." 
</P>
<P>
The principal benefit of the Korrvu method is that, by reducing damage to the 
items shipped, it helps companies cut costs related to claims and replacements. 
The Korrvu method also requires that less packaging material be used. 
</P>
<P>
But an unexpected, long-term benefit of switching to the new packaging system 
is its potential for alleviating waste disposal problems, Ridgeway said. The 
cardboard used in Korrvu is made already recyclable, even with the plastic 
attached, and one of two kinds of the plastic used is biodegradable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was accidental that it had an environmental application," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other advantages of using the Korrvu system is that its boxes can be 
stored flat when they are knocked down, reducing the amount of floor space used 
in warehouses and packaging areas. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the plastic windows, the boxes also can serve as display packages, 
allowing a retailer to show a product in a 360 degree form, yet not worry about 
a customer dropping it. 
</P>
<P>
David Ladd, shipping manager for Figi Graphics, a San Diego-based wall decor 
manufacturer, said the Korrvu packages have significantly improved the breakage 
rate for Figi's shipments of large picture frames. 
</P>
<P>
"It made an immediate difference in our packaging," Ladd said. 
</P>
<P>
Figi had tried several combinations of inner-package components, such as 
cardboard sleeves and Styrofoam peanuts, with little success. Using these 
methods, the business had a 15% breakage rate with its large-size merchandise, 
Ladd said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Korrvu packages were phased in last year, Ladd conducted a two-month 
study. More than 6,000 pieces were shipped and only 46 damage reports were 
filed for a breakage rate of .07%, Ladd said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Sklar, owner of Neon by Sklar, a San Diego-based manufacturer of glass 
components for neon products, said using Korrvu reduced the time it takes to 
package tiny glass bottles that the company ships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a unique packaging system," Sklar said. "There isn't anything else really 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
Since January, when the company began using the new packages, there have been 
no reports of breaks of the delicate glass on shipments of about 100 cases. 
Each case contains 600 of the bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Korrvu packaging has been used to ship a variety of products, ranging from 
delicate electronics parts to fragile china, and square windows ranging from 
one square inch to 1,296 square inches. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway discovered that there have been about a dozen similar attempts at 
suspending an item in film, but none were successful. The earliest attempt in 
1938 used latex rubber. "The idea was there, but it didn't work," Ridgeway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway took a different tack, literally. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength . . . is in being able to put tack, the ability to 'grab' 
something, in the film," so that there is a friction lock preventing the item 
from sliding around, he said. Ridgeway, 48, had almost 20 years in the 
packaging industry before he came up with the Korrvu design. He owned and 
worked at several packaging companies across the country until he started 
Concepts in Packaging in San Diego in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I started on a shoestring," Ridgeway said. "I found a sponsor account, a 
customer who was willing to help me get going because I was able to do a 
packaging design job for him.

WEDBUSH SELLS MORE OF GREAT AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wedbush Corp., the largest single shareholder of Great American Bank stock, 
sold off a huge chunk of its holdings in the troubled savings and loan last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
From April 27 to May 15, Wedbush sold 713,500 shares of its Great American 
stock, leaving the parent company of Wedbush Morgan Securities with 2,530,816 
shares, or 10.5% of the total Great American stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wedbush began selling off its Great American stock in earnest in April, 
the Los Angeles-based firm owned at one time 4,074,023 Great American shares, a 
17% stake in the thrift. Wedbush chairman Ed Wedbush is a member of Great 
American's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush, which paid an average $11 a share to acquire its 17% stake in Great 
American, absorbed huge losses on its April and May stock sales, which were 
transacted at prices ranging from $2.625 to $1.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
On its remaining Great American shares, for which Wedbush paid $27.5 million, 
the company faces a paper loss of more than $20 million on its investment, 
based on Great American's closing price of $2.75 a share Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The stock sales intensified in mid-May with Wedbush selling 156,000 shares of 
Great American on May 16 at prices as low as $1.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Wedbush was unavailable to comment Monday on the reasons for the stock 
sales. According to regulatory filings, Wedbush Corp. borrowed money to buy its 
Great American shares, and there is speculation that the company had to sell 
some of the shares to help pay off the debt.

LLOYD WEBBER, SPIELBERG TO TEAM ON ANIMATED 'CATS'; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: THE TWO HAVE A LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP AND EACH HAD EXPRESSED AN 
INTEREST IN WORKING WITH THE OTHER. 'IT'S LITERALLY A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN,' 
SAYS A UNIVERSAL EXECUTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Spielberg and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the most commercially successful 
figures in film and theater respectively, have joined forces for a full-length 
animated feature film adaptation of Lloyd Webber's hit Broadway musical "Cats." 
</P>
<P>
"It's literally a match made in heaven," said Tom Pollock, president of 
Universal Pictures, which is financing the film. "Both Steven and Andrew 
obviously have a strong sense of just what it is that the public wants to see." 
</P>
<P>
Though Spielberg and Webber will be "creatively responsible" for the film, no 
specific functions have yet been delineated, a studio spokeswoman said. Though 
Spielberg's previous animated films -- "The Land Before Time" and "An American 
Tail" -- were animated by Don Bluth, it has not been decided which animation 
company will do "Cats." 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said "Cats" is a natural for promotion. " 'Cats' is a pre-sold play 
that the world has heard about," he said. "That gives us a tremendous leg up in 
terms of marketing. And, unlike most animated films, it won't fall into the 
'children's ghetto.' It can work for everyone, just as the play has. That's our 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
"Cats," based on T. S. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats," opened on 
Broadway in 1982 and won seven Tony awards. It is currently in production in 15 
countries worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Pollock said that other studios approached Lloyd Webber about adapting "Cats" 
over the years and that Walt Disney approached Eliot "25 or 30 years ago." What 
made the difference in this case was a long-standing friendship between 
Spielberg and Webber, both of whom had expressed an interest in working with 
each other. Talks between the two for "Cats" have reportedly been going on for 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber's company, The Really Useful Group, currently has five musicals 
playing in London and three on Broadway. In addition to "Cats," which opened on 
the West End in 1981 (and is still running on both sides of the Atlantic after 
3,000 performances), the composer's credits include: "Joseph and the Amazing 
Technicolor Dreamcoat," "Evita," "Phantom of the Opera" and "Jesus Christ 
Superstar," which also made it the big screen. "Evita" was to have gone into 
production last year with Oliver Stone directing Meryl Streep, but the project 
has been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
An adaptation of "Phantom" is in pre-production at Warner Bros. and is 
scheduled to be released late next year. Lloyd Webber is producing with the 
London cast. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg is responsible for such films as "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" (the 
largest-grossing film in history), "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Jaws," "The 
Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun."

CAROLCO BUYS JOE ESZTERHAS SCRIPT FOR RECORD $3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just nine months ago, some Hollywood insiders were predicting the career demise 
of rogue screenwriter Joe Eszterhas. But for a few brief hours last Friday, 
Eszterhas emerged as the hottest personality in town. 
</P>
<P>
After an intense bidding war among at least 10 major and independent studios, 
Eszterhas sold his latest screenplay, "Basic Instinct," to Carolco Pictures for 
$3 million -- setting a record for so-called "spec" movie scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Carolco plans to immediately start producing the steamy thriller about the 
relationship between a policeman and a female writer-psychologist. While 
Carolco is not discussing details about the movie, the list of stars Carolco 
may seek out include Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner and Richard Gere for the lead, 
and Michelle Pfeiffer, Julia Roberts and Melanie Griffith as the co-star. No 
director has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Eszterhas stirred up a storm in Hollywood last fall when he attacked Creative 
Artists Agency President Michael Ovitz in a letter that later found its way 
into the press. In that letter, Eszterhas accused Ovitz of issuing threats 
after the writer said he was leaving CAA to rejoin his former agent Guy 
McElwaine at International Creative Management. Ovitz vigorously denied 
Eszterhas' charges. 
</P>
<P>
While many in Hollywood sided with Eszterhas when the letter became public, 
others called him suicidal for directly challenging Ovitz, considered to be one 
of the most powerful figures in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home in Marin County Monday, Eszterhas declined comment on the 
fallout from that incident. But it's clear from the bidding for "Basic 
Instinct" -- engineered by McElwaine and ICM President Jeff Berg -- that the 
writer can still command top fees. 
</P>
<P>
The bidding also suggests that prices for spec scripts -- screenplays that are 
completed and put out for bid rather than written under contract -- will 
continue to climb. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the Geffen Co. stunned its competitors by paying $1.75 million for a 
screenplay by "Lethal Weapon" writer Shane Black. Other $1 million-plus sales 
of screenplays are taking place with increasing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
The $3 million for "Basic Instinct" is also a new high for Eszterhas, who 
generally can command more than $1 million for a screenplay. In the past, 
Eszterhas has written hits such as "Jagged Edge," but his most recent films -- 
"Betrayed" and "Music Box" -- did not fare well at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Eszterhas defended the inflation of prices for scripts. "I've always felt that 
the script was at the heart of the movie," he said. "If you're going to pay 
actors and directors (high salaries), there's nothing wrong with paying the 
writer, too." 
</P>
<P>
The writer added that he prefers to write on spec, rather than under a studio 
contract. "I think you have more controls, and I loathe pitching (ideas to 
studios)," he said. "If you really believe strongly in a story, sometimes you 
have to write it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Carolco, which also agreed to pay $1 million to Irwin Winkler to produce "Basic 
Instinct," is no stranger to high-priced movie-making. The company is often 
viewed as one of the companies that helped bid up the price of actors. In 1987, 
Carolco agreed to pay Sylvester Stallone $16 million to star in "Rambo: First 
Blood Part 3," a fee that Stallone later gave up in favor of a percentage of 
the film's profits. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Carolco paid Arnold Schwarzennegger an estimated $8 million to 
star in "Total Recall." 
</P>
<P>
Carolco officials declined comment on the bidding war for the Eszterhas script. 
But Thomas Levine, the company's vice president for corporate development, 
said, "We bought a great project."

COURT LETS STATES PLACE LIMITS ON THE RIGHT TO DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in its first decision on the "right-to-die" issue, ruled 
Monday that the parents of a comatose woman do not have an automatic right 
under the U.S. Constitution to insist that hospital workers stop feeding her. 
</P>
<P>
Although a conscious patient has a right to reject all medical treatment, the 
high court said, the patient's family may not automatically invoke that right 
if the patient cannot speak for herself. Rather, a state is entitled to require 
that the family prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that the patient would 
wish to die, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-4 decision means that a 32-year-old Missouri woman, Nancy Cruzan, will 
continue to be kept alive in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
More broadly, the ruling means that some sensitive issues involving what has 
come to be called the right to die will continue to be decided on a 
state-by-state basis. 
</P>
<P>
For Californians, the impact of Monday's high court ruling should be minimal. 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court's foremost proponent of states' 
rights, said that state legislatures and state courts may use their own 
constitutions and laws to decide under what circumstances a life may be ended. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 decision cited by Rehnquist, the California courts said that a 
patient not only has a right to die but that a family member or legal guardian 
may make that final decision on behalf of a comatose or terminally ill patient. 
Because that state court ruling is based on state law, it is unaffected by 
Monday's high court ruling interpreting the U.S. Constitution, the chief 
justice said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real message of this decision is: Make your choices known and they will be 
respected," said Alexander Capron, a USC professor of law and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Missouri, the state judges would have let Nancy die if she had spoken 
to her doctor on the subject or signed a "living will" expressing her views, 
Capron said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling, far from answering all the questions on the right-to-die 
issue, ensures that it will continue to be debated in hospitals, legislatures 
and state courts. 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. Thanks to recent advances in medical technology, most 
Americans now face the likelihood that they -- or someone else -- will make 
decisions affecting when they die. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 million Americans die each year. About 80% of those deaths take place 
in a hospital or nursing home. And, in nearly every such death, a crucial 
decision is made at some point by a doctor, the patient or a relative on 
whether to stop, start or continue a potentially life-prolonging course of 
medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, when New Jersey teen-ager Karen Ann Quinlan lapsed into a coma, 
state courts have struggled to set rules on when medical treatment, life 
support and even food and water may be cut off from a still-living patient. 
</P>
<P>
A legal consensus had developed since then. At least 27 state courts have 
upheld a right to die for patients who have no hope of recovery, according to 
the Society for the Right to Die in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court had stood aside until now. It let stand a number of state 
court rulings upholding a right to die but refused to say whether any such 
right is included in the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But, two years ago, the Missouri Supreme Court departed from the consensus by 
ruling that the state's interest in "the right to life" outweighs the parents' 
assertion of their daughter's right to die. In a 4-3 decision, the Missouri 
court pointed out that Nancy Cruzan was not in pain, was not terminally ill and 
had not stated a clear view on whether she would want to die. Therefore, the 
state court said, it would "err on the side of life" and reject the parents' 
request to end her life. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Jan. 11, 1983, Nancy Cruzan was driving alone on an icy road, 
lost control of her car and was seriously injured. After being rushed to a 
hospital by paramedics, she was kept alive but never regained consciousness. 
Her family initially agreed to have a tube implanted in her stomach for food 
and water. Now, she is classified, like an estimated 10,000 Americans, as being 
in a "persistent vegetative state." 
</P>
<P>
In the years before the accident, Nancy had told a friend that she would not 
want to live as a "vegetable." Based on that evidence, a judge in Missouri had 
granted a request by Joe and Joyce Cruzan, Nancy's parents, to order the 
hospital to stop feeding her. 
</P>
<P>
But Missouri Atty. Gen. William Webster appealed to the state Supreme Court. 
Because the parents could not furnish "clear and convincing evidence" that 
Nancy would wish to die, she must be kept alive, the state court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzans then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that prohibits Missouri from 
requiring clear and convincing proof" that a patient would have wanted her life 
ended, Rehnquist said in announcing Monday's ruling (Cruzan vs. Missouri 
Department of Health, 88-1503). 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "risk of an erroneous decision" could cause judges to 
be cautious. As was noted in several friend-of-the-court briefs filed in the 
case, families of comatose patients sometimes stand to inherit large amounts of 
money if the relative dies. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rehnquist's opinion is a setback for the right-to-die movement, it is 
not a total loss. In a roundabout way, the chief justice endorsed the notion 
that a competent person has a constitutional right to reject all medical 
treatment, including food and water. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th Amendment says that a state may not "deprive any person of . . . 
liberty . . . without due process of law." This clause, Rehnquist said, 
establishes "the principle that a competent person has a constitutionally 
protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
This right includes, he added, "a constitutionally protected right to refuse 
life-saving hydration and nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
However, in a footnote, the chief justice said that this right to reject 
medical treatment does not stem from a general constitutional "right of 
privacy," a point that has been the focus of the abortion fight. His opinion 
was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy 
and Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist focused on the broad picture, but the dissenters focused on Nancy 
Cruzan and concluded that she should be allowed to die. She "has dwelt in a 
twilight zone for six years. She is oblivious to her surroundings and will 
remain so," said Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Also dissenting were Justices 
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.

From their homes of mud brick, 250 Indians of New Mexico's Pueblo Laguna tribe 
head down the road each day to what seems another world -- their jobs at Laguna 
Industries, a tribal company that last year produced $15 million in mobile 
communication stations and other high-tech hardware for the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ft. Apache Reservation in Arizona, visitors first see the Apache tribe's 
untethered horses, which amble down the main drag and even clamber onto the 
shady porches of two village churches. But what they see next is the tribe's 
ultra-modern computerized lumber mill, where Indian workers will produce 72 
million board feet of timber this year. 
</P>
<P>
In Montana, naked Crow tribesmen are praying in sweat lodges this month, and 
the young men have just slain three buffalo on Big Horn Mountain, in 
preparation for the all-important Sun Dance. Meanwhile, the tribe's attorneys 
are at work on an equally critical job: preparing courtroom challenges to 
government control of the tribe's water and financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
With a keen eye toward the economic and political transformation taking place 
in Eastern Europe, such tribes are pursuing perestroika, Native American-style. 
</P>
<P>
Saddled with staggering unemployment rates of 40% to 80%, they, too, are 
attempting a restructuring toward modern capitalism and political reform. And, 
in a bid for self-determination, they have begun to wrest control of their 
affairs from the historically paternalistic Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose 
economic policies, even the BIA admits, have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Their effort is being helped along by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, 
where political economist Joseph Kalt and his students have worked for three 
years to define -- and remove -- barriers to prosperity for Indians, the 
poorest minority group by far in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The parallels to what is happening in the rest of the world are just 
transparent," Kalt said. "The economic challenges, the self-determination being 
faced now by all of Eastern Europe, is happening here, too." 
</P>
<P>
New constitutions and legal codes are being written that spell out the 
mysteries of tribal law to outside investors, and long-term developments are 
sprouting on Indian lands where income once came primarily from grazing cattle 
or selling souvenirs and cheap cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Though the gusts of change come in fits and starts, they are buffeting the BIA, 
a bureaucracy that had seemed almost as immovable as the Kremlin once was. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Brown, assistant secretary of the Interior for Indian affairs and a 
Pascua-Yaqui Indian, said the BIA "has a clear mandate from everyone . . . that 
we have to change some things, and that the status quo is no longer 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
But just as Poland faces the almost unimaginable task of creating a private 
banking system from scratch, the Indian nations are confronted with huge 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, they cannot use their lands as collateral, and must dream up 
other ways of persuading banks to make development loans. And because of tribal 
sovereign immunity, most major corporations have been unwilling to sign 
contracts with tribal entities that cannot be hauled to court. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kalt said, tribes such as the Crow are grappling with bizarre forms 
of tribal government, foisted upon them by federal officials in the 1930s, that 
make self-governing -- and economic development -- virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Issues Complex 
</P>
<P>
So complex are the obstacles that Sue Williams, a Harvard Law School-educated 
Sioux who is a leading attorney on Indian matters, holds three-day retreats 
with tribal leaders and uses story board drawings as a device to help figure 
out which of a host of legal issues to tackle first. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, of Albuquerque, said the failure of Congress to draw sharp lines of 
authority between federal, state and tribal governments has created "a 
jurisdictional nightmare that horrifies developers" and forces tribes to 
repeatedly sue the government over virtually every area of dispute, from 
multiple taxation on businesses to water rights. 
</P>
<P>
Kalt, in a 1989 study, wrote that "when actors other than the tribes control 
major decisions, the chances of any economic development at all are 
substantially reduced." Economic health is improving now, he said, only on 
reservations with powerful tribal leaders or strong council governments who 
have severely reduced reliance on the BIA. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most dramatic departures from BIA control, Kalt said, the White 
Mountain Apaches in eastern Arizona in 1987 sued the BIA for longtime 
mismanagement of tribal lands. Today, the tribe no longer lets BIA officials 
attend important tribal meetings. 
</P>
<P>
They have taken a road to independence that includes expansion of the 
Apache-owned Sunrise Resort, the largest ski area in the Southwest. It operates 
one of the most efficient lumber mills in the West. While quite poor, the 
tribe's unemployment rate is only 30%, compared to a BIA estimated average of 
40% reservation unemployment nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the Apaches are meeting with Merrill Lynch and other financiers 
over a proposal to turn an abandoned sawmill into a paper mill. 
</P>
<P>
But with independence has come pain. A depressed lumber market and poor fiscal 
decisions by an inexperienced Apache manager, now fired, have led to a work 
slowdown at the lumber mill and layoffs of tribal council workers. 
</P>
<P>
And educated Apaches, like Stephanie Joseph, 23, wonder if the reservation will 
ever catch up with the outside world. Just laid off from her $11,000-a-year 
tribal council job, with which she supported her mother and four siblings, 
Joseph said: "I'm trained in Lotus and Word Perfect but there's no computer 
jobs here, so we live poor." 
</P>
<P>
Contradictions abound. The movie house is showing "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles," and Apache boys wear "rat tail" hair tufts, just like kids in 
Westwood. Yet workers at Sunrise Resort recently asked a medicine man to 
exorcise a ghost from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Endfield Jr., a former banker, now manager of Sunrise, says the tribe "has 
one foot in the 21st Century and one in another era. But this is why we want 
tribal control, not outsiders running our lives. We take very seriously the 
spiritual needs of our people." 
</P>
<P>
Economist Kalt contends that a series of court rulings and congressional acts 
since 1975 has slowly transformed the federal government's role from one of 
"guardian" to one of "mentor." But new roadblocks are still being thrown in the 
way of Indian self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruling Limits Arrests 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that tribal judges could not jail criminals 
who were not local tribal members. Tribes can no longer hold Anglo drunk 
drivers, Indian men from other tribes who beat local women to whom they are 
married, or other outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"The feds give lip service to Indian self-determination, and then the Supreme 
Court goes and does this damn fool thing," said Cate Stetson, Williams' law 
partner and an expert on Indian policy. "Our tribal clients wonder if they can 
trust the white man." 
</P>
<P>
Indians, remembering a long history of being duped, have vowed never to be 
cheated again. But, as Kalt's research group found when it delved into the deep 
poverty among the Crow, some Anglos are still, in effect, buying Indians' fur 
pelts with cheap glass trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,000-member Crow nation in Big Horn County, Montana, owns one of the 
world's largest known deposits of coal and great stands of timber. The tribe's 
worth is estimated at a stunning $27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But years ago, the tribe signed a contract with a mining company to extract the 
rich coal reserves. Now, Kalt contends, the Crow are being paid "about half the 
market value" for coal in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Joe Kalt we get $3 million a year from all our contracts, and one 
student did a little figuring and told us we are getting a rate of return of 
.01% -- worse than any Eastern European country," said outgoing Crow Chairman 
Richard Real Bird. "We were enticed, forced, pressured and starved out to give 
up our resources. Now we want them back." 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Real Bird has sued virtually every government agency 
involved in Indian matters and launched an all-out political war against the 
BIA, which maintains close control over Crow budgets and economic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months, the tables have turned against Real Bird. On April 6, he 
was convicted of bank fraud -- for misleading banks about available tribal 
collateral in order to get loans to buy land that the Crow want to protect near 
the famous Custer Battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
He and his attorneys claim that his indictment, and those of other tribal 
leaders, is a retaliation by federal officials who want to silence him, a 
charge that is denied by federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the tribe, deeply divided and shamed by heavy coverage of the 
indictments in the Anglo-dominated Montana news media, swept Real Bird out of 
office in May, electing a Crow employee of the BIA who promised a peaceful 
coexistence with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Kalt said the Crow tribe's inability to rise above destructive internal 
politics is caused by its "wholly unworkable" government, created by outsiders 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Crow have the purest form of democracy to be found in North America, with 
anyone of voting age also a member of government," Kalt said. "They have a 
2,800-member tribal council that is wild -- no rules. Until recently, people 
came armed with loaded guns to council chambers." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in a riotous meeting that landed some Crow in the hospital, tribal 
members rejected reforms designed by Real Bird and Kalt to create a normal 
government and constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such chaos under the Crow form of government that everything we tried 
crashed on the rocks," Kalt said. 
</P>
<P>
While Indian leaders regard the reform of flawed tribal governments as 
essential, they also believe that Congress must help tribes attract the 
financial backing of lenders and major U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Williams contends that a federal tax credit is needed to encourage firms to 
invest on reservations. And she supports a bill to create an Indian-controlled 
federal loan agency that would "take investment decisions out of the hands of 
bewildered career personnel at BIA." 
</P>
<P>
But meantime, Indian business leaders question American corporate policies that 
would pour investments into faraway Czechoslovakia but largely shun the 
stricken Indian nations at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the enthusiasm among the Fortune 500 companies when the walls came down 
in Berlin, and yet here we have walls coming down through sheer force of our 
will -- but where are the Fortune 500 companies?" asked Ron Solimon, of the 
Pueblo Laguna tribe west of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Exceptions 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions, however. Purely by accident, Solimon and tribal leaders 
struck up a relationship with an executive of Raytheon Co. who helped the 
Lagunas design a development strategy that paved the way for a federal loan. A 
high-tech factory, Laguna Industries, was born. 
</P>
<P>
"Raytheon was a mentor and teacher to us just when we needed it," said Solimon, 
an attorney and president of Laguna Industries. "But we need to see hundreds 
more like them in Indian country." 
</P>
<P>
Another tribal firm won a government contract to restore a contaminated 
wasteland the size of downtown Los Angeles -- Jackpile, the world's largest 
open-pit uranium mine, which closed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the two companies appears to have inspired a boomlet of 
enterprise on the sagebrush-studded 550,000-acre reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco and Denise Pedro have parlayed an ancient recipe for kiln-baked bread 
into a 2,000-loaf-a-week business that ships the soft, frog-shaped loaves out 
of state. A modern grocery store has opened in an abandoned warehouse, and last 
month, Elaine Sarracino's daughter started a private shuttle service to 
Albuquerque using her van. 
</P>
<P>
At Laguna High School, not far from the whitewashed Spanish mission in which 
the Lagunas have worshipped continuously since the 1600s, 40% of this year's 
seniors are going to college, up from 10% a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
With the blessings of the tribal council Solimon and Smith are pursuing 
development as a way of keeping the young from moving to cities and breaking up 
the tribe's deeply spiritual, clan-oriented culture. 
</P>
<P>
But the unemployment rate is still 50%, and the Lagunas still run into doubters 
who remember their failed efforts at farming and cattle feedlots in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Each time the tribe seeks financing from a local bank with which they have done 
business for 30 years, it is a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"To expand Laguna Industries, we had to produce collateral equal to 120% of a 
loan, plus a BIA guarantee on 90% of the loan in case of default," Smith said, 
shaking his head. "But we're not going to default." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, however, points to "an extraordinary decision" in Arizona, where a 
bank recently sealed a development loan to the Gila River tribe with a "Western 
handshake." 
</P>
<P>
The bank had concluded that it was impossible to protect itself from 
"maddeningly ambiguous" federal laws that make it uncertain whether lenders can 
obtain settlements from tribes who default. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Williams said, instead of deep-sixing the loan, "the bank made a 
decision based on the history of the tribe repaying its loans and the stability 
of its government. They simply decided they trust the tribe." 
</P>
<P>
Such indications of change may be slight, when measured against grotesque 
economic conditions that have left half of all Indians living below the poverty 
line. 
</P>
<P>
But, Kalt said: "After 100 years of failures upon failures under the thumb of 
outsiders, for the first time we are seeing sustainable economic development on 
Indian terms."

JUSTICES UPHOLD CURB ON MINORS SEEKING ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, sharply divided again on an issue it has confronted seven 
times in the last 14 years, ruled Monday that a state may require a minor to 
notify both her parents before obtaining an abortion -- provided it gives her 
the option of seeking permission from a judge instead. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, relatively narrow in its reach, underlines how contentious the 
abortion issue has been for the court and how deeply the justices have been 
drawn into making fine distinctions between which abortion regulations pass 
constitutional muster and which do not. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a Minnesota law requiring notification of both parents -- although 
not their permission -- before an abortion, even if the parents are divorced or 
if one parent has long been estranged from the pregnant girl. The drafters of 
the Minnesota law, in anticipation of court challenges, inserted a provision 
permitting a so-called "judicial bypass" of its parental notification rule if 
the courts should require it. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia, voted to uphold the 
law without requiring the option of seeking a judge's permission instead of 
notifying both parents. 
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, along with Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood 
Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, voted to strike down the law entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her now customary role as the court's swing 
vote on abortion, cast the deciding vote. She ruled that Minnesota may keep its 
notification rule but only by providing the "judicial bypass." 
</P>
<P>
The high court already has issued rulings that bar states from giving parents 
an absolute veto over a teen-age girl's decision to obtain an abortion. On the 
other hand, the court has upheld laws that require notification of one parent. 
</P>
<P>
In a second case Monday, the court upheld a similar judicial bypass plan from 
Ohio on a 6-3 vote. Abortion rights activists had challenged several aspects of 
the plan, saying that it was too burdensome to teen-agers seeking abortions. 
Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun dissented from the decision, written by Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the limited scope of the Minnesota decision, both sides in the highly 
political abortion debate seized on it as an occasion to rally their troops by 
declaring the future of legal abortion in the United States to be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's 5-4 ruling "represents further evidence that Roe vs. Wade will 
sometime soon slip into the history books," said Gary Bauer of the 
anti-abortion Family Research Council, referring to the 17-year-old high court 
decision that first established a constitutional right to an abortion. "We're 
very gratified," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"One more Supreme Court appointment by an anti-choice Administration, and the 
right to choose safe, legal abortion will be history," Kate Michelman of the 
National Abortion Rights Action League declared in a statement. The ruling is 
"tremendously alarming." 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota case stems from that state's desire to go further than other 
states by requiring notification of both parents. Opponents of the law argued 
that, for many teen-agers, notifying both parents could be impossible, or in 
some cases dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
During the five years -- 1981 through 1986 -- in which the Minnesota law was in 
force, 3,573 girls in the state sought judicial approval to have an abortion 
without telling their parents. Only nine were turned down, and six withdrew 
their petitions before the judge decided. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many teen-agers -- particularly in rural areas -- were 
delayed in or prevented from having abortions because of the added burden of 
meeting the law's requirements, according to findings by the lower courts that 
reviewed the law. 
</P>
<P>
Of the roughly 1.5 million legal abortions performed annually in the United 
States, 180,000 -- about 12% -- have been on minors. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 33 states, including California, have laws that require girls 
younger than 18 to notify a parent before having an abortion, according to a 
survey by the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. 
Minnesota's was considered the most stringent such law because it required that 
both parents be told and provided virtually no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
But, of the states with notification laws, only 11, mostly in the South and 
Midwest, currently enforce the statutes. In 14 states, including California, 
notification laws have been blocked by courts, and eight more states that have 
such laws generally do not enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling has no direct effect on the California law, which has been 
blocked since 1987 on grounds that it conflicts with privacy rights guaranteed 
by the state Constitution, rather than the federal Constitution. A state court 
is likely to conduct a trial early next year to consider whether to make 
permanent the current order blocking the notification law. Under the current 
court order, pregnant California teen-agers may obtain an abortion without 
notifying either parent. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in California, access to abortion is still guaranteed by the state 
Constitution," said Margaret C. Crosby, staff attorney for the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Minnesota law does not require a girl age 17 or younger to get her 
parents' permission for an abortion, it does say that she must tell both of 
them and then wait 48 hours before having the operation. The law provided a few 
exceptions -- if an emergency abortion is needed to save a girl's life or if a 
girl tells authorities that she is a victim of child abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
A separate section of the law provides for a judicial bypass that allows 
teen-agers who want to tell only one parent or who do not want to inform either 
of them to get a judge's approval to have an abortion. The law specified that 
the bypass provision would go into effect if the courts did not approve the 
notification requirement standing alone.

'LATE FILERS' FOR AMNESTY CAMP OUT AT INS OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN and JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping for a last chance to qualify under the federal amnesty program, hundreds 
of undocumented aliens have been crowding local offices of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, some camping out overnight only to be turned away 
because of a shortage of staff to process all the cases. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amnesty program officially ended in May, 1988, the new rush has 
resulted from two lawsuits that cleared the way for an estimated 250,000 more 
people to qualify for permanent residency. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits, filed by the League of United Latin American Citizens and 
Catholic Social Services, contended that the INS unfairly excluded people who 
had left the country briefly since 1982. The 1986 Immigration Reform and 
Naturalization Act granted amnesty to aliens who could prove they had been 
living in this country continuously since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits asked that amnesty be extended to people who left the country for 
"brief, casual or innocent" periods since 1982 but maintained residency in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The INS, which is fighting the suits, has been ordered to begin processing 
applications of "late filers" under the new program, according to INS 
officials. But because staffing level at agency offices were reduced when the 
amnesty program ended, the new flood of applicants overburdened local staffs. 
</P>
<P>
At the legalization office on Ritchey Street in Santa Ana, police were called 
last Monday when a fistfight broke out among several people over who was first 
in line. That same week, the crush of people waiting broke down one of the 
front doors, according to a private security officer at the office and to 
immigrant rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Similar problems have occurred at the 10 legalization offices in the Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Orange County areas, INS officials say. Crowds also have 
been reported in recent weeks at legalization offices in Chicago, New York, 
Miami, Tucson and Phoenix, immigrant advocacy groups say. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hearing about fistfights all over the country," said Peter Schey, 
executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dona Coultice, of the INS office in Laguna Niguel, said the crush is worse in 
certain areas than in others. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the offices closer to downtown Los Angeles, and the one in San 
Fernando, are the hardest hit," she said. "Huntington Park and Hollywood are 
also feeling it, probably because of the large concentration of undocumenteds." 
</P>
<P>
Nilesh Patel, a Los Angeles insurance salesman, camped out overnight with a 
friend from India outside the Wilshire Boulevard INS office last week, waiting 
for it to open. They arrived at 6 p.m. the day before to assure they would be 
waited on, along with 30 or 40 other people. 
</P>
<P>
"They only took the first 10 people in line, and we never got in," Patel said. 
"My friend is just going to keep trying. It's first come, first served. I think 
10 is too small a number."

ON CALIFORNIA: HERE COME THE '60S, WITH FBI IN TOW

<P>
Do you recall the prediction that the 1990s will amount to a replay of the 
'60s? I'm not certain about its origins, but I believe this prognostication was 
based on the observation by historian Arthur Schlesinger that American culture 
revolves in 30-year cycles. 
</P>
<P>
If the Schlesinger theory holds, the '90s should flower into a decade of social 
turmoil and yearning for higher truths. This may or may not turn out to be the 
case, of course, but it behooves us to watch for the early signs. And sure 
enough, the last few weeks have revealed a California tableau that seems to 
spring straight from 1969. 
</P>
<P>
I am referring to the case of Earth First!, a militant and hirsute crowd of 
wilderness-lovers that has out-radicaled every other conservation group in the 
country. You might think of Earth First! as the SNCC (pronounced "Snick," 
remember?) of the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back Earth First! and its leader, Dave Foreman, promoted the idea 
of booby-trapping trees with steel spikes so any chain saws that dared 
penetrate their bark would promptly disassemble. This notion quickly earned 
Earth First! a big blackball from old-liners such as the Sierra Club and the 
Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
This year, in what appears to be a strategy to go legit, Earth First! is 
organizing a season of demonstrations in the big timber country of the North 
Coast. Named Redwood Summer after the famous Freedom Summer of 1964 in 
Mississippi, Earth First! is hoping that thousands of college kids and fellow 
travelers will show up to do battle with the timber harvesters. 
</P>

Nothing electrifying about that, but stay with me. Now we get to the good part. 
Somewhere along the way Earth First! learned the trick of pushing the 
government's buttons and thereby resurrected another artifact of the '60s: a 
full-blown campaign to wipe them out. 
</P>
<P>
The latest manifestation of this campaign took place last month in Oakland. As 
Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney, the chief organizers for Redwood Summer, rolled 
through the streets in their Subaru, a pipe bomb exploded in the back seat. 
Cherney was not seriously hurt. Bari suffered a broken pelvis and some hearing 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
How did law enforcement react? Before the smoke had cleared, they arrested Bari 
and Cherney on the suspicion that the two blew themselves up with their own 
bomb. What was the rush, and what was the evidence? 
</P>
<P>
No one knows because the police won't say, but on Friday, six weeks after the 
bombing, the Alameda County DA's office had to admit in court that it still 
lacked cause for bringing charges against the two. 
</P>
<P>
However embarrassing to the Oakland police, this episode pales beside the 
operations carried out by the FBI against Earth First! Last August, several 
dozen FBI agents swooped down on a group of Earth Firsters outside of Phoenix 
as they allegedly prepared to hack down some power transmission lines. This 
bust was the result of a 2 1/2-year investigation and 1,000 hours of secretly 
recorded conversations. One thousand hours is roughly 42 days of conversation, 
running 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, the Earth First! founder, was not in this group. But the next day more 
FBI agents raided his home in Tucson and busted Foreman for conspiring with the 
purported hackers. 
</P>
<P>
Sense the deja vu here from the old days, when Martin Luther King Jr.'s every 
phone call was tapped by the FBI? When any lefty group with more than a dozen 
members had a couple of undercover agents among them? 
</P>
<P>
You could argue, of course, that Earth First! is a dangerous bunch. Hacking 
down a major electrical transmission line is not, after all, an innocuous act, 
if that truly was the intention of the crowd in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But was crime-busting the motive of the FBI? Maybe not. Buried among those 
1,000 hours of tapes was a conversation between the chief undercover agent and 
his FBI contact that was inadvertently recorded and submitted to the court. The 
undercover agent first refers to Earth First! as "low-budget" and confides they 
are not involved in the "hurtin' of people." Then he refers to the upcoming 
Foreman bust: 
</P>
<P>
"This guy (Foreman) isn't the guy we need to pop . . . in terms of actual 
perpetrator. This is the guy we need to pop to send a message. And that's all 
we're really doing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So curious. Could it be that the FBI had something to do with the hasty charges 
in Oakland? And what is the message that the FBI wants to send? That crime 
doesn't pay? Somehow I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
More likely the message is the same one sent to Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Stokely Carmichael and Daniel Berrigan. It's a message about control. 
</P>
<P>
So welcome back to the '60s. We're all here once again, and the circle is 
unbroken.

PSYCHOLOGISTS WIN HIGH COURT RULING ON HOSPITAL SUPERVISION; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: DECISION ALLOWS THEM TO OVERSEE TREATMENT OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. 
PSYCHIATRISTS HAD FOUGHT TO BAR THE PRACTICE.

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Monday settled a hard-fought mental health turf war, 
ruling that hospitals may permit clinical psychologists, like medically trained 
psychiatrists, to supervise the treatment of their hospitalized patients. 
</P>
<P>
The court, by a vote of 4 to 3, rejected claims by medical groups, who had 
argued that psychologists, because they are not medical doctors, do not have 
the legal authority to care for the mentally ill in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Two state statutes -- one recognizing psychology as an "independent health 
profession," the other barring "discrimination" against psychologists -- permit 
hospitals to allow psychologists on their staffs to supervise the admission, 
diagnosis, treatment and discharge of their patients, the court said in an 
opinion by Justice Allen E. Broussard. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in a lengthy dispute between psychiatrists -- who as physicians 
may perform surgery, prescribe drugs and order shock treatment -- and 
psychologists, who may not perform those tasks but may conduct testing, 
counseling and psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists, backed by the 280,000-member American Medical Assn. and the 
35,000-member American Psychiatric Assn., contended that psychologists lack the 
broad training and experience of doctors and should not be allowed to supervise 
their patients when their condition is serious enough to warrant 
hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists, led by the 70,000-member American Psychological Assn. and its 
10,000-member California affiliate, argued that such restrictions denied 
patients free choice and would reduce competition, thus contributing to 
escalating health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling was welcomed warmly by Michele H. Licht of Sherman Oaks, an 
attorney for the California Assn. of Psychology Providers. "This is clearly a 
victory for patients and consumers, who will benefit from having more 
competition in the health care field," Licht said. "Patients should have the 
right to be under the care of their own psychologist, and not be cut off at the 
hospital door." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis J. Horvitz of Encino, attorney for a coalition of medical organizations, 
expressed several concerns about the potential impact of expanding the 
authority of psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
Horvitz noted that much of the treatment of hospitalized mental patients 
requires the use of medications, which must be prescribed by physicians. He 
added that hospitals could open themselves to liability for medical malpractice 
if they granted staff privileges to an unqualified psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1984 after state health officials issued regulations 
prohibiting hospitals from permitting a psychologist to take primary 
responsibility for diagnosis and treatment of hospitalized patients. 
</P>
<P>
A group of psychologists brought suit, contending the regulations violated 
state laws passed in 1978 and 1980 that appeared to ease previous restrictions 
on psychologists. In 1985, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge agreed with the 
psychologists and overturned the regulations. But three years later, a state 
Court of Appeal reversed that ruling and placed the prime responsibility back 
in the hands of psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's ruling, the state high court concluded the law was intended to 
leave it up to hospitals whether to permit psychologists to perform the same 
functions that they performed in outpatient practice. 
</P>
<P>
The justices acknowledged the concerns of the medical profession about placing 
authority in the hands of psychologists. "Such disputes over the competence of 
the professions must be decided by the Legislature, not the courts," Broussard 
wrote in an opinion joined by Justices Stanley Mosk and David N. Eagleson and 
Appellate Justice Steven J. Stone, sitting temporarily by special assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The court noted that physicians must still be available at a hospital to 
determine if a patient needs medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Joyce L. Kennard, joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice 
Edward A. Panelli, dissented.

The progressive Reform branch of Judaism on Monday became the largest 
Judeo-Christian body to openly welcome gay and lesbian clergy as full-fledged 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 101st annual convention of Reform Judaism's Central Conference 
of American Rabbis overwhelming adopted the recommendation of a committee of 
rabbis even though the Bible and Jewish law says homosexual behavior is sinful. 
</P>
<P>
"All Jews are religiously equal regardless of their sexual orientation," 
entitling them to ordination and placement in synagogues that would accept 
them, a report by the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released last month after four years of study, does not back 
homosexual weddings and declared that heterosexual, monogamous marriage is 
still the norm in Jewish life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty narrow tight rope to walk, but I believe it was a mature 
statement made with integrity," said Rabbi Joseph Glaser, executive vice 
president of the 1,550-member conference of rabbis. Glaser added that he did 
not know how many congregations would be willing to accept a homosexual rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
The Reform branch of Judaism, with 1.3 million members nationally, is the 
largest and most liberal of the three major wings of American Judaism. 
Conservative Judaism, the next largest, steers a more moderate course in 
adapting Judaism to modern life. Orthodox synagogues, which strictly observe 
Jewish law, embrace about 10% of U.S. Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
Biblical tradition calls homosexual behavior an "abomination," but major Jewish 
and Christian denominations which tend to reexamine the Bible in the light of 
contemporary events have agonized over the question of accepting gays as 
clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Only the small Unitarian Universalist Assn. and the tiny Reconstructionist 
Jewish movement have removed all bars to homosexual clergy. The 
1.1-million-member United Church of Christ decided in 1983 that local units 
should not discriminate against gay and lesbian clergy candidates, and some 
openly homosexual ministers have been ordained. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Reform statement is more sympathetic than the United Church of Christ 
resolution. The rabbis say that they are "aware of loving and committed 
relationships between people of the same sex" and that gay and lesbian rabbis 
"are serving their communities effectively, with dignity, compassion and 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Samuel Karff of Houston, president of the rabbis' conference, said that 
Reform advocates a "creative tension between Torah and life" that is between 
core biblical teachings and the realities of the contemporary world. 
</P>
<P>
After the 17-member Reform Committee on Homosexuality and the Rabbinate made 
its recommendations public last month, the Union of Orthodox Jewish 
Congregations condemned the recommendations, saying, "The entire idea is an 
abomination." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbis in Conservative Judaism, which takes a middle-of-the-road position among 
U.S. Jews and rivals Reform Judaism in size, endorsed civil rights and 
synagogue membership for homosexuals at their convention last month. But the 
issue of ordination has not been tackled. 
</P>
<P>
By accepting the recommendation of the committee, the 500 Reform rabbis at the 
conference here endorsed the admissions policy of Reform's Hebrew Union College 
that places no obstacles on candidates who have homosexual preferences, if they 
are otherwise qualified as seminarians. The four-campus Hebrew Union College 
had not put its policy in writing until the committee asked for it. Some 
overtly gay rabbi candidates could be rejected under the newly stated policy, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"Any individual who's obsessive on one particular issue in a way that it would 
dominate their rabbinate is likely to be disqualified," said Rabbi Lee Bycel, 
dean of Hebrew Union College's Los Angeles campus. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Allen Bennett of San Francisco said he may be the only openly homosexual 
cleric among Reform Rabbis, but he does not expect that dozens of other rabbis 
will declare their homosexuality now that the report has been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have a sense of relief, but not a sense of security," Bennett said. 
"Their jobs won't be any more secure because of this statement." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the statement cautions homosexual rabbis already serving synagogues or 
Jewish institutions to think twice before "coming out of the closet. The 
committee does not want to encourage colleagues to put their careers at risk." 
</P>
<P>
A handful of rabbis spoke against the recommendations during the debate Monday, 
citing either Scripture or traditional morality. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Biblical condemnation of same-sex behavior in Leviticus 18:22, 
Rabbi Phil Berger of Oceanside, N.Y., said, "To the best of my knowledge, this 
(verse) has not been reinterpreted by any Jewish Biblical scholar. . . . Much 
of the behavior in our society needs correcting." 
</P>
<P>
Another opponent said the action will put Reform Judaism further at odds with 
Conservative and Orthodox Jews and will be divisive for many members of Reform 
congregations. "Someday we will turn around and find that we are leaders 
without people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Ronald Millstein of New York City said he disagreed with both the 
seminary admission policy and the statement that all Jews are religiously 
equal. "As persons they are equal, but not as Jews," Millstein asserted. 
</P>
<P>
But other rabbis favoring the change pointed to Reform's proclivity to select 
what it believes are timeless Biblical truths and ignore strictures deemed 
inappropriate or harsh today. 
</P>
<P>
The debate Monday ended with the remarks of a proponent of the report's 
conclusions who said that Jews do not obey Scripture when it says adulterers 
should be stoned. "In our congregations, we put (adulterers) on our synagogue 
boards," said Rabbi David Horowitz of Akron, Ohio.

EARTHQUAKE: FOREIGN AID WORKERS CREDIT THE PROMPT RESPONSE WITH PREVENTING EVEN

<P>
With tent clinics and med-evac helicopters, Iran relief officials have made 
practice in war pay off in combatting a devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid workers in the ravaged towns and villages of the quake region 
Monday credited the prompt response of Iran's Red Crescent Society with 
preventing the disaster from being even worse. 
</P>
<P>
"By Saturday, two days after the earthquake, they had tents in the villages for 
the homeless," said Christian Brauner, a West German Red Cross disaster-relief 
specialist. "The war (with Iraq from 1980 to 1988) was a precedent that is now 
proving useful in relief and medical work." 
</P>
<P>
Calls went out immediately for blood donors, clothing and food. Manpower was 
thrown into distribution that, while lacking the appearance of efficiency, 
nevertheless was fast, the Western workers said. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter landing zone in a field here in Roudbar, alongside the Safid 
River, was marked Monday with the dust-whirling activity of a wartime 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the seriously injured from Roudbar, Manjil and the mountain villages 
behind them were evacuated over the weekend. Military helicopters ferried them 
from the Roudbar landing zone to the city of Rasht, where they were loaded 
aboard air force cargo planes for transfer to Tehran hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The operations were hampered by continuing aftershocks. Tehran University's 
Geophysics Center reported that 22 of them, some as strong as magnitude 5.5, 
had occurred in the region in the last 24 hours. The main quake Thursday was 
measured at a magnitude of 7.3 by Iran, 7.7 by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
During the war with Iraq, the Iranian army's infamous human wave attacks -- 
sometimes across minefields -- created thousands of casualties, not unlike the 
tide of victims in the natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll rose quickly after the earthquake Thursday leveled as many as 
340 towns and villages in northern Iran and now stands at an estimated 50,000. 
Estimates of the numbers of hurt and homeless vary widely but run as high as 
200,000 and 500,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"The war with Iraq gave us a good training for the huge numbers of casualties 
overnight," noted Dr. Afshin Assadi, a resident surgeon at Tehran's Khomeini 
Hospital. "For a surgeon, the war was a great medical experience. Now I am 
using it with the earthquake victims." 
</P>
<P>
In Roudbar, lesser injuries are treated at the equivalent of military aid 
stations lining the main street of the city. Medics were still busy Monday, 
working with those injured in rescue attempts and re-dressing older quake 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
At the Government Health Center, doctors treated a man with a mangled hand on 
an outdoor table. Around the dirt courtyard of the center, piles of bottled and 
tablet medicine lay on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Down near the helicopter field, three mobile Red Crescent clinics -- buses, 
each with 18 litter beds -- have handled 200 patients a day since Thursday's 
quake. "We're well-supplied with medicine," a doctor said, but he looked 
fatigued from the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Many survivors in hard-hit Roudbar stood aimlessly on the main street. Brauner, 
the West German specialist, said the syndrome is common in disasters with heavy 
loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody here who has not lost a loved one. Whole families have been 
shattered, and the survivors have no one to comfort them in their grief," he 
explained. "In Armenia (in December, 1988), we saw the quake destroying a 
culture along with the families and the houses. Families are broken, and the 
sustaining comfort they give is lost." 
</P>
<P>
While there is nothing the relief workers can do for these cases, they have had 
the answers in other areas. The fundamentalist Komiteh in Roudbar has a 
thriving distribution center for old clothing for the homeless. The Red 
Crescent Society is supplying shelter with military-style six-person tents. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign relief efforts are concentrated in medical care and the continuing 
rescue work. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where even international aid to suffering people is a political 
issue between fundamentalists and moderates, the pragmatist supporters of 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani appear to be winning the day. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said Monday afternoon that 62 aircraft from 26 foreign 
countries had arrived at Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran since the 
earthquake struck Thursday morning. There were 11 foreign medical teams, 
including a 40-person unit from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the quake aid comes from the unlikeliest of sources. Author Salman 
Rushdie, who is living under an Iranian death threat for alleged blasphemy 
against Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses," is donating $8,650 to a 
relief fund, the British newspaper The Independent reported. 
</P>
<P>
Y-Care International, a charity started by Terry Waite, the Church of England 
envoy believed held hostage by a pro-Iranian group in Lebanon, is collecting 
donations for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
Even Iraq, Iran's foe during eight years of war, offered help. 
</P>
<P>
Although fundamentalist newspapers such as Kayhan International and the Jomhuri 
Islami continued to rail against what they called the "opportunistic" aid 
offered by the United States, Western diplomats based in Iran said the aid 
represents a political victory for Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
"By accepting the aid," said one diplomat, "the Rafsanjani forces are saying 
they want to be welcomed back into the world community. In this case, at least, 
he appears to have been more powerful than the fundamentalists." 
</P>
<P>
The United States sent Iran $291,000 in aid for the earthquake victims as a 
"humanitarian gesture" but does not expect to reap any political benefits from 
the decision, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But the huge presence of international aid in the earthquake relief effort was 
overshadowed by the national effort of Iranians coming to the aid of their 
fellow countrymen and women. 
</P>
<P>
The aid ranged from ordinary citizens driving in their cars and trucks to the 
disaster site to help dig out victims, to a group of nationally celebrated 
wrestlers who raised money with charity matches and took it to the devastated 
villages. Included in the group was the son of the late Iranian wrestling 
champion Gholamreza Takhti, who became famous for his relief efforts after a 
destructive 1962 quake in Qazvin. 
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that 100,000 victims have 
been pulled alive from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the foreign relief workers have set up their operations in Manjil. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Kirby is team leader for 17 members of the British International Rescue 
Corps. They are working in tandem with French sniffer dogs and use 
sophisticated listening equipment in the continuing effort to find live 
villagers trapped in the rubble of their mountain homes. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby said his team had found several bodies but no survivors. He is not 
optimistic.

BLAST ROCKS LONDON CLUB FREQUENTED BY TORIES

A bomb exploded Monday evening in an exclusive social club in downtown London 
frequented by members of the ruling Conservative Party. Nine people were 
injured, one seriously, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims of the blast at the Carlton Club included Lord Kaberry, 82, a 
member of the House of Lords, his wife said. Two tourists from New York, 
Alexander Kahan, 62, and his wife, Jane, 49, suffered minor cuts from flying 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Two seconds further along the road and we could have been killed," Kahan said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, containing 10 to 15 pounds of high explosives, was planted just 
inside the door of the 158-year-old club, said George Churchill-Coleman, head 
of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad. The club has long been considered one 
of the most venerable symbols of the British Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on the Irish 
Republican Army, which has been waging a new terror campaign to end British 
rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings a new dimension to the campaign, and I must warn the public in 
general that these people are determined to cause injury and maim," said 
Churchill-Coleman, clearly alluding to the IRA. "Everyone must be on their 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
The bombers struck at one of the most popular meeting places for Cabinet 
ministers, lawmakers and other members of the governing Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an honorary member of the exclusive men's 
club, called the attack "one more outrage in a catalog of terrorist 
inhumanity." 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is responsible stands condemned of total and callous disregard for 
human life, both within the club and among passers-by," she said in Dublin, 
Ireland, where she was attending a European Community summit. "These people are 
prepared to bomb and maim others indiscriminately for their own perverted 
satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst attack on a Conservative Party target since 1984, when an IRA 
bomb narrowly missed Thatcher in a hotel in the seaside resort of Brighton. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at 8:40 p.m. on the first floor of the club, which is 
near Trafalgar Square and a few hundred yards from Buckingham Palace

ARABS FACE 'THICKENED' SETTLEMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: ISRAELIS CONCENTRATE ON EXPANDING EXISTING DEVELOPMENTS IN OCCUPIED 
LANDS.

BEIT IJZA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By day, the settlers and the army planted fence posts to block off the land, 
and by night, Sabri Ghurayeb tore them down. 
</P>
<P>
Finally last spring, soldiers caught Ghurayeb at his nightly chore and put him 
in jail for 70 days on charges of taking down a "security barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Although a suit over the ownership of the 10 acres is pending in court, troops 
supervised the completion of the fence, and the property was in effect annexed 
to Givon Hadasha, a settlement a few miles northwest of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Ghurayeb, a Palestinian, cut off from the disputed land, but the 
fence almost surrounds his house. His home is like an island connected to his 
village by a narrow, fenced causeway. While he was in jail, someone ransacked 
his home and shot his dog. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlers come right up to the fence and peek in like we are in a zoo," his 
wife, Sakina, said. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the Ghurayebs and their Israeli neighbors is part of a 
quiet phenomenon proceeding apace on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although 
much controversy surrounds the issue of new settlements and who might go live 
in them, it is the growth of existing settlements that is most notable. 
</P>
<P>
Israelis who are committed to keeping all the occupied lands call the process 
"thickening," and they believe that it is more critical to Israel's claim to 
the land than increasing the number of new settlements, at least for the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
"The more of us who live there, the less anyone can say we have to give it 
away," said Elyakim Haetzni, who belongs to an annexationist party aligned with 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is taking steps to convince foreign governments that Soviet immigrants 
will not be funneled to the West Bank and Gaza. Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, 
an ardent booster of settlements, said Sunday that the government will focus on 
housing the newcomers inside Israel's pre-1967 borders. 
</P>
<P>
His statement was designed to allay the U.S. and Soviet concerns that Israel 
might flood the territories with immigrants. About 1.7 million Palestinians 
live in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has withheld loan guarantees for Soviet immigrant 
housing as it waits for Israeli assurances. Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev threatened to curtail migration of the Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
While trying to mollify superpower concerns, Israel reserves the right of 
Israelis to move to the territories. On Monday, Prime Minister Shamir 
reaffirmed Israel's contention that, in principle, the West Bank and Gaza are 
open to Israeli settlement, even by Soviet immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in a democratic country has the right to settle where he wishes," 
Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement adherents are suspicious that any retreat might put Israel's claim 
to the territories in jeopardy. The United States views trading of occupied 
land for peace as the key formula for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. Both President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have 
repeatedly referred to settlements as an "obstacle" to peace. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the thickening process picks up pace. In Betar, southwest of 
Jerusalem, a complex designed for strict Orthodox Jewish residents is nearing 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers get government-backed breaks: Interest-free, 30-year mortgages of up to 
$40,000 are available; needy families can qualify for $75,000 interest-free 
loans. In Israel itself, such incentives are available only in the far corners 
of the country; Betar is 10 miles from Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The government has provided roads and sewers. The land was expropriated from 
nearby Arab villages. 
</P>
<P>
New highways are crisscrossing the West Bank to circumvent Arab villages, 
weaving in and out of rough valleys, while narrow and heavily traveled roads 
serving Palestinians go without repair. Israeli researchers have estimated that 
government investment in the West Bank alone has reached $3 billion. Tax breaks 
are given for developing Israeli businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The independent newspaper Haaretz predicts that, based on the number of new 
housing units planned for the next 2 1/2 years by Shamir's government, 120,000 
Israelis will reside in the West Bank and Gaza. About 88,000 live there now, 
the newspaper estimates. 
</P>
<P>
In Givon Hadasha, thickening takes the form of new, stone-faced, two-story 
houses with peaked tile roofs and little front gardens, modest unless compared 
with cities in Israel where most people live in cramped apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Tzion, a resident of Givon, is getting ready to move from his trailer, the 
housing available in the settlement when it was founded in 1978, into one of 
the villas. 
</P>
<P>
Tzion finds nothing controversial in what he's doing, based on his community's 
closeness to the city. "We're really part of the capital," he said, "a single 
bloc of population." 
</P>
<P>
As for Ghurayeb, Tzion offers a conspiracy theory. 
</P>
<P>
"He is paid by the PLO to cause trouble," Tzion assured a visitor. The land 
never belonged to Ghurayeb and is destined for new housing, Tzion said. The 
fence is meant to protect the settlement from the Arab uprising, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Who ransacked his house? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was Arab workers who built the fence," Tzion said. 
</P>
<P>
Ghurayeb claims he has papers approved by the Israeli government to back his 
claim to the land. He says that the settlers have charged him with inciting 
riots and throwing stones in order to convert his case into a terror issue. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, a court will hear Ghurayeb's complaint that the fence was built 
illegally. Then another hearing over the land itself will be judged 
simultaneously with the charges of stone-throwing. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he loses the land, Ghurayeb says he will stay in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was on this land, my grandfather and his grandfather," Ghurayeb 
lamented. "All the power of Israel and America cannot get me to go."

U.S. WELCOMES ISRAEL PLEDGE BUT WANTS MORE

The Bush Administration said Monday that Israel's pledge not to make a special 
effort to settle Soviet Jewish immigrants in the disputed West Bank and Gaza 
Strip is "a hopeful development" but one stopping well short of the steps 
required to free $400 million in U.S. support for immigrant housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
More than 24 hours after Ariel Sharon, the hard-line housing minister in Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new government, delivered the seemingly conciliatory 
message, U.S. officials said they had not yet seen the full text and were not 
quite sure how to evaluate the promise. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called Sharon's 
comments to the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency "a step in the right 
direction." She said they do not constitute the assurance that Washington is 
demanding -- that U.S. aid not be used for settlement of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has approved $400 million in loan guarantees to help finance housing 
for the flood of Soviet Jews who began pouring into Israel after Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev eased emigration requirements. However, the 
Administration has said that it will not release the money unless Israel 
provides guarantees that the funds will not be spent in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration will still seek the assurances that Secretary (of State 
James A.) Baker (III) had discussed," Tutwiler said. But she added: "We have 
not laid out the specifics of how those assurances will be sought." 
</P>
<P>
Baker told Congress on March 1 that the United States would seek assurance that 
Israel would stop all settlement activity beyond the pre-1967 borders. He said 
it would not be enough to promise that no U.S. money would be used to build 
housing in the occupied territories because that would permit Jerusalem to use 
the U.S. aid for houses in Israel proper -- freeing other funds for 
construction in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official noted that Baker sought to fuzz that statement the next day 
and has avoided being as specific since. He said there is little doubt that the 
Administration will accept something short of a total ban on settlements but 
that it wants far more than Sharon offered. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that the government will not direct Soviet immigrants to the 
territories. But he said that Soviet Jews who choose to live there will receive 
the same financial aid as other settlers.

SENATE DEBATES FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT

The Senate on Monday debated a constitutional amendment against flag burning 
that was killed by the House last week but remained alive with possible 
political consequence. 
</P>
<P>
Flag burning, like pornography, was "beyond the Founding Fathers' understanding 
of freedom," said Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), calling on the Senate to help send 
the amendment to the states for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
"If we tamper with the Bill of Rights on the 200th anniversary of our 
Constitution, then we are ultimately diminishing every flag in America," said 
Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said 
the Senate was engaged in "an attempt to enmesh the flag in politics in the 
November elections" rather than in an attempt to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 254 to 177 in favor of the flag amendment, 34 votes short of 
the two-thirds majority needed. Two-thirds approval is needed in both houses to 
send a proposed amendment to the states for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) led the opposition, which portrayed the 
amendment as an attack on the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said last week he planned no more House votes on the amendment this year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Senate proponents led by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) insisted that 
their chamber vote on the amendment.

TRIAL OF 3 IN RAPE, BEATING OF CENTRAL PARK JOGGER OPENS

As three teen-age defendants sat stone-faced, a prosecutor charged Monday they 
were part of the gang that assaulted, raped and left for dead a woman jogger in 
Central Park during a night of random violence that shocked the nation a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer told the jury of 10 men and two women 
that Yusef Salaam, 16, one of the defendants, allegedly confessed to detectives 
hours later: "It was fun." 
</P>
<P>
When the 29-year-old jogger, an investment banker, was found in a puddle of 
blood and mud April 20, 1989, she was barely alive, Lederer said. The jogger 
was bound with a blood-soaked shirt. She was thrashing and groaning. Her left 
eye was swollen shut. Her right eye was staring blankly. She had multiple skull 
fractures. Her pulse was 40. She had lost three-quarters of her blood. 
</P>
<P>
"She was cold to the touch. . . . She was dying," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Use your common sense. Listen carefully," she urged the jurors in opening 
arguments in the Central Park jogger case. "I submit to you after you hear all 
the evidence, these defendants are guilty of a savage attack." 
</P>
<P>
The attack by a gang of 30 young men who swept through the park randomly 
beating, robbing and raping people in their path added the word "wilding" to 
New York's vocabulary of fear and violence. It sparked a national debate over 
the deeper causes of the incident as the jogger clung to life in a Manhattan 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Her recovery surprised even her physicians. She has resumed jogging, returned 
to her job at Salomon Bros. where she has been promoted to a vice presidency. 
She has not been identified by news media because of the nature of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Lederer said the jogger had no memory of her assault and rape. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the severity of the injuries, she has lost any ability to recollect 
those hours," the prosecutor explained. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam, Raymond Santana, 16, and Antron McCray, 15, are the first of six 
defendants to go on trial in the case. They are charged with attempted murder, 
rape, assault, robbery and riot. The others will be tried later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Lederer told the jurors that statements the defendants made to detectives after 
the crime would play a large part in the prosecution's presentation during the 
trial, which is expected to last about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor quoted McCray as telling detectives: "We charged her, everybody 
started hitting her and such. We grabbed her legs and such and we took turns 
getting on top of her." 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the defense attorneys' arguments Monday was that the police took 
advantage of their clients and put words in their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
"When you listen to the evidence, you will see that it does not establish the 
guilt of my client," said Michael Joseph, McCray's lawyer. He said that the 
wilding victims would not be able to identify their attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Salaam's lawyer, Robert Burns, indicated that the prosecution's evidence will 
be inconclusive. The defense lawyers also argued that no scientific evidence 
directly linked their clients to the rape of the jogger. 
</P>
<P>
But Lederer told the jury that statements by the defendants detail how the 
jogger was struck on the head by a pipe, a brick and a rock at 9:30 p.m. on 
April 19, and how she was gang raped. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its case, the prosecution said it would call 50 witnesses, including 
other joggers and bicyclists who were attacked by the gang, would present 
medical and photographic evidence showing the extent of the jogger's injuries 
when she was rushed to Metropolitan Hospital near Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
Lederer told how the jogger was found by two men walking through the moonlit 
park at 1:30 a.m. They heard moaning, and summoned the police. In the glare of 
police car headlights, officers saw a shocking sight. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw a young woman whose hair was matted with mud and blood," Lederer 
said. "She was naked but for her jogging bra, tied up with a blood-soaked shirt 
that went around her neck, mouth and wrists. She lay there in the mud thrashing 
and groaning."

RIGHTS BILL FOR DISABLED PASSES HURDLE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: HOUSE CONFEREES DROP A PROVISION ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO TRANSFER FOOD 
HANDLERS WITH AIDS. OPPONENTS SAY IT IS NOT MEDICALLY JUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House negotiators on landmark civil rights legislation for the disabled agreed 
Monday to scrap a provision that would have allowed employers to transfer food 
handlers with the AIDS virus to other jobs if the public perceived a health 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial amendment, deleted from the legislation by a narrow 12-10 
vote of House conferees, was one of the last obstacles to final congressional 
approval of the bill and its signing into law by President Bush this week. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other Senate supporters of the AIDS provision 
were expected to fight to restore it when the compromise version of the 
disability bill reaches the Senate floor for a vote. That could delay final 
action until after next week's Fourth of July recess. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he (Helms) will raise Cain," said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a 
principal sponsor of the legislation. "I hope the White House will come in and 
support the conferees' major actions." 
</P>
<P>
The President, who favors the underlying legislation, has not taken a position 
on the food handlers' amendment. Louis W. Sullivan, his secretary of health and 
human services, has termed the amendment unnecessary and unjustified because 
medical evidence shows that the AIDS virus cannot be transmitted by touching 
food. 
</P>
<P>
Passed by overwhelming majorities in both the Senate and House, the basic bill 
has been termed a "declaration of independence" for 43 million disabled 
Americans because it bars discrimination against them in employment, public 
services, public accommodations and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected House passage of the food handlers' amendment, however, forced a 
Senate-House conference to reconcile differences between the two versions of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's sponsors said that the amendment would undercut the bill's 
anti-discrimination thrust by sanctioning bias based on perception rather than 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be the most important legislation that will pass this year," said 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). "I don't think the Senate will want to derail 
this bill . . . for an amendment that is scientifically and medically unsound." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and other opponents of the provision argue that medical experts 
unanimously agree that the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, 
cannot be transmitted through food. The deadly disease is spread primarily by 
sexual contact, blood transfusions and contaminated hypodermic needles, public 
health authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Jim Chapman (R-Tex.), the amendment's sponsor, insists that restaurant 
owners could face bankruptcy if customers perceived that HIV-infected employees 
threatened them. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's amendment cleared the House by a vote of 199 to 187. In an 
extraordinary action, the Senate then instructed its conferees to support the 
House-passed provision after opponents lost a test of strength by a 53-40 vote. 
But since the amendment had been added in the House, it could be deleted by the 
House conferees before their Senate counterparts could vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Steve Bartlett (R-Tex.), a supporter of the amendment, said that the 
Senate vote put both houses of Congress on record in favor of it. He warned 
that restaurants "in small cities and towns around this country" could be "put 
out of business" if the amendment is not included. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Nev.) said that the amendment would protect restaurant 
patrons from the diseases that frequently afflict those whose immune systems 
are decimated by AIDS. "People with HIV are more susceptible to communicable 
diseases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Harkin said that the Chapman amendment had nothing to do with preserving 
public health. "There are times when you have to stand up and be courageous and 
legislate based on facts and not on perceptions or fear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two leading House Democrats -- Chairman Jack Brooks of the Judiciary Committee 
and Chairman John D. Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee -- joined 
eight Republican conferees in voting to retain the amendment. Rep. Hamilton 
Fish (R-N.Y.), top-ranking Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, joined 
11 Democrats who favored dropping it.

</P>
<P>
ART: A CONSERVATIVE SECT HAD CROPPED PARTIAL IMAGES FROM LARGER COMPOSITIONS. 
IT ATTACKED GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR SEXUALLY EXPLICIT WORKS.

<P>
A federal judge on Monday ordered a conservative Mississippi religious group to 
cease publication and distribution of a brochure which used severely cropped 
pictures -- which were represented as complete images -- to support an attack 
on National Endowment for the Arts funding of sexually explicit works. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, directed at the American Family Assn. and its director, the Rev. 
Donald Wildmon, came at the conclusion of a day-long trial of a lawsuit brought 
by multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz sued after the pamphlet, using only portions of 14 larger images he 
created for a one-man show titled "Tongues of Flame," was mailed to members of 
Congress and Christian leaders earlier this year. The excerpted images, which 
were not identified as having been cropped, all have strong sexual or religious 
overtones. Many of the fragments included depictions of homosexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Dist. Court Judge William C. Conner told lawyers for the organization that 
"the spirit of the injunction" would be violated if it issues other broadsides 
against artists that rely on the undisclosed use of heavily cropped 
reproductions of their art. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon and his group, Conner said, "are not enjoined from writing anything 
about Mr. Wojnarowicz's work which is true, (but) the First Amendment does not 
allow libel or the reproduction of altered or mutilated copies of an artist's 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon declined to comment on the ruling, though one of his lawyers, Benjamin 
W. Bull, characterized it as a "Pyrrhic victory," since the Wildmon group had 
already stopped distributing the disputed mailing. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz said Conner's ruling "sent a clear message that their 
misrepresentations of the work were as we had claimed." 
</P>
<P>
The injunction order came after a day of testimony by Wildmon, Wojnarowicz and 
an expert art policy witness. 
</P>
<P>
The Wojnarowicz show sparked controversy among conservatives because the arts 
endowment supported it with a $15,000 grant to Illinois State University, whose 
gallery organized the show and opened it several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Conner reserved judgment on the lawsuit as a whole -- which includes counts 
alleging defamation of character, copyright infringement and violation of a New 
York state law that protects the integrity of artworks. But the injunction was 
seen as a victory for Wojnarowicz, who has AIDS and whose work often includes 
AIDS-related themes, sometimes with strong sexual content.

D.A. TO FILE SUIT AGAINST O.C. PROPERTY MANAGER; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: FORMER TENANTS HAVE ACCUSED THE GARDEN GROVE FIRM OF FAILING TO 
RETURN SECURITY DEPOSITS.

<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office announced Monday that it intends 
to file an unfair-business-practice lawsuit against a property management firm 
accused of denying refunds of apartment security deposits to hundreds of Orange 
County renters. 
</P>
<P>
"The extent of the problem appears to be major . . . and we certainly plan to 
go to court this week," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Nolan, who is in charge of 
the office's consumer and environmental protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, The Times reported that at least 113 small-claims suits had been 
filed against Elerding Properties of Garden Grove and that the Marine Corps had 
taken the extraordinary step of removing the firm's 10 Orange County and two 
Los Angeles County complexes from its approved-housing list. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the firm, operated by the sons of late Newport Beach millionaire 
Charles E. Elerding Jr., have repeatedly declined to comment and did so again 
on Monday. Arthur Morello, an attorney for the corporation, also declined to 
say if officials were aware of the district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Nolan said investigators opened their inquiry two weeks ago upon 
receiving two complaints from tenants who accused the firm of failing to refund 
their security deposits -- typically between $300 and $650 -- as required by 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Nolan said, investigators have secured certified copies of at least 50 
unsatisfied default judgments against Elerding Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we have not been to court is because it takes some time to get 
these certified judgments from the various (small-claims) courts," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said the district attorney will seek restitution for the affected tenants 
as well as at least $125,000 in penalties -- $2,500 for each case in which 
court judgments are yet to be paid. "We want to get those (default judgments) 
satisfied for those former tenants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred other former renters have not filed suit to recover their 
security deposits but have written letters of complaint to Elerding Properties, 
according to two company employees who asked not to be identified for fear that 
they will be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said that she expects many of those potential victims to call the 
consumer protection unit and that, "if and when we are able to secure 
restitutions, they will benefit." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking restitution for the affected renters, Nolan said, 
prosecutors will ask a Superior Court judge to grant a temporary injunction 
restraining Elerding Properties and its officials from continuing to deny bona 
fide refunds to former renters. 
</P>
<P>
"The preliminary injunction would force (Elerding Properties) to return the 
deposits in a timely fashion," Nolan explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County complexes owned by Elerding Properties include: Amberwood, in 
Buena Park; Casa Madrid, in Cypress; Mountain View Apartments and Villa Viejo 
Apartments, in El Toro; City Park Plaza, in Garden Grove; Huntington Apartments 
and Bahia Puerto, in Huntington Beach; Tustin Arms Apartments, in Orange; and 
Cerritos Apartments and Pine Tree Apartments, in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also reported that the Orange County Environmental Health Division 
had received at least 43 complaints since January of last year that substandard 
housing conditions exist at some of the firm's apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said investigators will also look into health and safety complaints, 
adding, however, that the district attorney's office is limited in the kind of 
action it can take in such matters. But, she said, "we will contact the proper 
regulatory agencies and have them do it."

7-YEAR IRVINE CO. DISPUTE SETTLED; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: A MICHIGAN COURT REFEREE DECIDES THAT HEIRESS JOAN IRVINE SMITH SHOULD 
BE PAID $35 MILLION MORE THAN SHE WAS OFFERED FOR HER SHARES IN 1983. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Michigan court referee ruled Monday that Joan Irvine Smith, the Irvine Co. 
heiress, should be paid $149 million plus interest for her stock in the company 
-- $35 million more than she was offered in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, in one of the largest such cases on record, may end a bitter 
7-year-old dispute that pitted two of Orange County's wealthiest and most 
private residents against each other. The nasty public battle revolved around 
whether Smith had been fairly compensated for her shares in the company when 
Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren bought most of it. 
</P>
<P>
The high-stakes trial was the stuff of a television miniseries: On one side was 
Bren, an intense, reserved billionaire with enough land and power to impose his 
own architectural vision on a huge slice of Southern California. On the other 
was Smith, a feisty member of the horsy set whose family traces its money and 
its toughness to the cattle ranching days of 19th-Century California. 
</P>
<P>
And the stakes were huge indeed: The Irvine Co. owns nearly one-sixth of Orange 
County's land. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith had demanded a much larger sum -- $330 million plus interest -- 
she and her attorney claimed victory Monday. Bren had offered to pay her $114 
million. The amount of interest and the court costs -- which could add up to 
millions more -- must still be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling is closer to the company's estimate, but we're quite pleased," said 
Howard I. Friedman, Smith's attorney. "The bottom line is that Mrs. Smith gets 
approximately a 35% increase over what Mr. Bren was offering her." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith, who with her mother Athalie Clarke owned 11% of the company: "I 
understand the Irvine Co. is saying this is a great victory. But I am not 
unhappy. It is still a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Smith -- who, in deciding to sell to Bren, broke almost all the family's links 
to the company -- said she is going to take some time before she decides 
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., however, said it is pleased with the ruling because it 
"essentially rejected the entire basis of Mrs. Smith's case," said Gary H. 
Hunt, Irvine Co. senior vice president. After subtracting millions of dollars 
in legal costs, "the bottom line is that Mrs. Smith and her mother will receive 
only modestly more than she would have received on the day the merger was 
approved in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said the company is unlikely to appeal. Bren, who is one of the nation's 
richest men, was visiting Italy Monday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Development officials in the county said they expect the outcome to have little 
impact on the Irvine Co.'s various local projects. 
</P>
<P>
There are still some issues to be determined by referee Robert B. Webster, a 
retired Michigan judge who presided over the case. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest will be the subject of a hearing to determine how much interest 
Smith will get on the $149 million. Smith's attorney estimates that the 
interest could add as much as $26 million more to the total over the seven-year 
life of the case. Irvine Co. attorneys said it would probably be considerably 
less. 
</P>
<P>
The referee may also decide to award attorney's fees to one side or another. 
The Irvine Co. estimates that its legal expenses total $15 million over the 
seven years and that Smith's costs are probably about the same. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who was appointed to hear the case so that it would not tie up a 
courtroom for years, said he would leave the issue of attorney fees up to the 
Michigan Circuit Court, which must approve his ruling. The trial was held in 
Michigan because the company is incorporated there. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it was long prepared to pay as much as $200 million -- far 
more than the referee awarded -- and that it is able to pay the award through 
lines of credit already established with lenders. The amount is not payable 
until the issues of interest and attorneys' costs are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had been asking for $330 million plus interest, or about $500 million, an 
amount that might have seriously hurt even a landholder as large as the Irvine 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, 57, bought out his fellow shareholders in 1983 for a whopping $200,000 a 
share. The group had bought the shares just six years before at $6,000; they 
reaped a 3,400% return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 57, whose grandfather founded the Irvine Co. in 1894, also agreed to 
sell her 550 shares, but she demanded three times more, or $600,000 a share. 
Thousands of acres in Orange County's most desirable neighborhoods, she 
insisted, were worth that much. (With Monday's ruling, she wound up with 
$271,000 a share.) 
</P>
<P>
When the two could not agree, the company had to go to court and ask a judge to 
set a fair price. Smith had the right to insist on a court hearing under state 
laws that protect shareholders of privately held companies from being squeezed 
out at unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent trial, held in a rented office outside Detroit, dragged on 
through 150 days in the courtroom between 1987 and 1989. It covered 27,000 
pages in trial transcripts and pleadings, chewed up an estimated $30 million in 
legal fees and left both sides with tarnished images. 
</P>
<P>
Smith painted Bren as a conniving schemer and Bren's attorneys portrayed her as 
a greedy, litigious eccentric. She contended that Bren exaggerated the 
company's problems in order to frighten and mislead shareholders and railroad 
them into selling at a low price. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous, said Bren, pointing out that other shareholders who sold to him at 
$200,000 a share were among the most astute investors in the nation -- Wall 
Street investment bankers and executives of large corporations such as auto 
chief Henry Ford II and shopping center developer A. Alfred Taubman. It was 
unlikely, Bren argued, that these men would underestimate the value of their 
stock by $400,000 a share. Therefore, he said, the court should accept that 
price as fair. 
</P>
<P>
The referee in his ruling Monday rejected Bren's contention that the 1983 sale 
price was the best representation of the company's value. But he also rejected 
the opinions of three experts Smith put on the stand, who put the company's 
worth at more than $3 billion in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The referee did largely accept the testimony of the company's own experts, who 
appraised the company at $1.22 billion. The referee adjusted that estimate 
slightly to come up with his $1.36-billion estimate of the company's worth. 
</P>
<P>
Cases such as these are complicated because it is hard to value the stock of a 
privately held company, which the Irvine Co. is. Unlike that of a public 
company, the stock is not traded openly on an exchange, where the price is 
determined by public demand and can be easily tracked in newspaper stock 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. is especially hard to value because there is nothing to compare 
it to: It owns a stretch of immensely valuable Orange County land 22 miles 
across and 9 miles deep in some places, a stretch squarely in the path of 
growth moving south from Los Angeles. Some of the 64,000 acres it owns have 
sold for more than $1 million. It is, in fact, the largest private owner of 
land in any of the nation's metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
The case breaks some new legal ground, said William B. Campbell, an attorney 
representing the Irvine Co. Campbell said the referee, in rejecting Smith's 
estimate of the company's value, also rejected a legal doctrine known as the 
"Delaware block," which rigidly prescribes the way a company is valued for 
legal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The referee, Campbell said, rejected that method as old-fashioned. Courts had 
been chipping away at the doctrine, he said, but so far none had rejected it 
out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
The bright side for Bren is that he has not had to pay a dime to Smith in the 
meantime. The Irvine Co. has been able to keep and use millions of dollars it 
would otherwise have had to pay Smith in 1983 if she had agreed then to Bren's 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes magazine estimates Bren's net worth at $1.8 billion, making him one of 
the 20 richest people in the nation -- wealthier than much better-known tycoons 
such as Ted Turner, Donald J. Trump, Harry Helmsley, Rupert Murdoch and August 
Busch. 
</P>
<P>
But Bren does not like to talk about his wealth. The profiles in national 
publications make him downright uneasy. That is partly because he loathes 
publicity and partly because speculation about his wealth riles California's 
powerful slow-growth movement and irks environmentalists who question why Bren 
needs to develop more vacant land when he is already a billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Bren and Smith represent two antagonistic California cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, the son of a Hollywood producer, grew up in classic California new-money 
style. He began amassing his fortune in the building boom that began in 
California after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Smith grew up riding horses over the vast family holdings, a scion of a family 
that had already been rich for two generations by the time she was born and 
that saw the ranch as its barony. Smith now stages horse shows at her stables 
near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has been fighting with Irvine Co. management since taking a seat on the 
company's board at age 24 in 1957, when women were expected to defer to male 
business judgment. She had 22% of the stock; her grandfather had put most of 
the rest in a trust, run by a foundation, in order to lessen inheritance taxes 
and prevent the ranch from being sold. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her fights were more or less public-spirited; she pressured a reluctant 
company to donate land to build the University of California at Irvine. Some 
were more pragmatic; she continually complained about the small dividends on 
her stock. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Smith forced the foundation to sell the company for $337 million. 
Buying was a group of heavyweight investors led by Taubman, a Detroit 
real-estate magnate estimated by Forbes to be even richer than Bren. The group 
took in Smith, who sold them her 22% of the shares for $72 million and then 
bought half of it back -- 11% -- for $3.3 million. The largest investor by far 
-- he bought a third of the shares -- was Bren, by then a millionaire 
California home builder. 
</P>
<P>
The company prospered until the recession of the early 1980s, when Bren began 
to complain that the company was selling far too much land to accumulate 
short-term profits and was not planning adequately for the future. 
</P>
<P>
After arguing with Taubman, who was the chairman, Bren offered to buy the 
company in 1983. For the purpose of putting a price on the shares, he valued 
the company at $1 billion. Most of the investors sold, including Smith -- who 
argued that the company was actually worth $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Leslie Berkman contributed to this report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COURT CONFLICT 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the value of the Irvine Co.'s stock centered on several issues 
that were aired in a lengthy trial in Michigan in 1987-88. Those issues and the 
stance of the opposing parties are outlined below: 
</P>
<P>
DONALD L. BREN'S ARGUMENTS: 
</P>
<P>
He says the Irvine Co. was worth only $1 billion in 1983. So Smith's stock was 
worth only about $114 million that year and -- after other shareholders sold -- 
only $88 million since Bren no longer needed her shares to control the company. 
Here are his reasons, according to Bren's lawyers: 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that the other shareholders -- some of the most experienced 
investors in the nation, under no pressure to sell and intimately familiar with 
the company -- would underestimate the worth of their own stock by two-thirds, 
as Smith insists they did. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is merely seeking a windfall from her stock without sharing any of the 
risks faced by the company over the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's own experts couldn't agree on whether the company was worth $2.6 
billion or $3.3 billion, a sizable difference of $600 million. She's 
essentially asking a judge to "pick a number" out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
The company's own hired appraisers consistently came up with a value of around 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If Smith thought the company was so valuable, why -- instead of selling -- 
didn't she accept Bren's alternative offer to double her shares in the company 
at no extra cost? The explanation: She must have thought the company was worth 
less than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
JOAN IRVINE SMITH'S ARGUMENTS: 
</P>
<P>
She says the Irvine Co. was worth about $3 billion in 1983, when Bren bought it 
based on a valuation of only $1 billion. So her 11% of the company's stock 
should be worth about $330 million instead of the amount Bren offered, she 
says. Here's why, according to her lawyers: 
</P>
<P>
Since the privately held company wasn't shopped around to a lot of other buyers 
who might have made higher offers, it's impossible to know whether the 
$1-billion value Bren set on the company is a fair price. One sale -- to Bren 
-- isn't enough to determine a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
The company seriously underestimated its worth and overstated its taxes at the 
time of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
By painting a bleak picture of the company and then stirring up dissension in 
1983, Bren duped fellow investors and pressured them into selling. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also rejected an alternative offer to double her stock in the company at 
no cost because she feared that Bren would ruin the company by loading it with 
debt once he was in control. 
</P>
<P>
The other shareholders may have been extremely successful business people, but 
because the Irvine Co. is so large as to be virtually unique, they had no other 
companies to compare it to and thus didn't realize its full value. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s major projects 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. still owns more than 64,000 acres in Orange County. The 
following is a list of the company's major projects that are under development 
or are being planned: 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Coast: After years of fighting with environmental groups, The 
Irvine Co. scaled back its plans for the stretch of barren coast between 
Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. Once called the Irvine Coast, the company 
changed the name recently to the snazzier Newport Coast. The company has 
approval from the county and the Coastal Commission to build three hotels, two 
golf courses and up to 2,600 homes on the hills' 9,400 acres, 7,200 of which 
will be open space. The first 50 or so lots for houses will probably go on sale 
later this year, the golf courses open next year, and the hotels open in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Laurel: The company has approval from county government to build what's 
essentially a small town of 3,200 homes with its own golf course, school and 
shopping center on 2,150 acres in Laguna Canyon, which stretches inland from 
Laguna Beach. But a massive demonstration last year persuaded the company it 
had better delay construction, despite the fact that at that point it needed 
only minor technical approvals from the county. The project is on hold while 
Laguna Beach, the company and environmentalists study putting a bond issue on 
the ballot to buy the land from the company with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine housing: The company is finishing up two residential neighborhoods, 
Westpark and Turtle Rock. It had requests before the city to build more houses 
in Westpark and the Northwood neighborhood but withdrew them recently while it 
waits for the city to decide how much affordable housing it will require 
developers to build. 
</P>
<P>
Jamboree Center: At the San Diego Freeway and Jamboree Road in Irvine, the 
company is building the last two of five mid-rise office buildings. Jamboree 
Center has landed more large tenants recently than any other office project in 
the county, allowing the company to construct the buildings ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Spectrum: At the intersection of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in 
Irvine, the company is building what it says is the largest business park in 
the world. The company is selling some of the 2,600 acres at Spectrum and 
keeping others to build its own portfolio of industrial and office buildings. A 
mall is also planned, although the company has had trouble signing up major 
tenants. Spectrum is about two-thirds completed. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Ranch: About 1,500 homes have already been built on 1,740 acres the 
company owns in unincorporated part of the the county abutting the city of 
Tustin. A total of 9,000 are planned and approved. 
</P>
<P>
Orange: The company's East Orange development covers 7,00 acres just east of 
the city of Orange but within the city's planning jurisdiction. The company 
proposes to build up to 12,350 houses here, and the city in December approved 
the company's rough plans for the first 1,500 acres. It'll be another 18 months 
before the company refines it's plans enough to begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Canyon: East of the city of Anaheim in the canyons at the furthermost 
reach of the company's landholdings, the company proposed recently to build 
10,000 homes, although no official application has been made to the city yet. 
An outcry from environmentalists and others made the company reconsider its 
plans, which it now says will be "scaled back significantly."

COUNCIL REJECTS DEVELOPMENT ON HELLMAN RANCH 
</P>

<P>
After four years of heated debate, the City Council late Monday denied a 
developer's request to build a residential housing tract on 149 acres of the 
Hellman Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote appeared to mark an end, at least temporarily, to the Mola 
Development Corp.'s quest to build 329 single-family homes in northwest Seal 
Beach. The plan, which had met stiff resistance from environmentalists since 
the beginning, also called for the company to restore 41 acres of wetlands and 
to donate 26 acres for city parks. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, council members expressed concern over conflicting geological 
reports concerning an earthquake fault that runs beneath the area. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many conflicting reports," said Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe, who 
voted against the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear strong evidence that there is a hazard" from an earthquake fault, 
Councilman Frank Laszlo added. "The city of Seal Beach should not be used as 
guinea pigs for new mitigation measures to reduce hazards of future 
earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the project were Laszlo and the two members who were elected to 
the council on May 8 -- Forsythe and Marilyn Bruce Hastings. Voting for the 
project were Councilman Joe Hunt and Mayor Edna Wilson. After the council cast 
its vote, a crowd of more than 250 people broke out in cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Evans, project manager for Mola, would not comment on the vote or say if 
the company planned to resubmit its plans another time. 
</P>
<P>
Before the May 8 election, the council had supported the Mola project by a 4-1 
margin. The council approved Mola's proposal last fall, but in March, an Orange 
County Superior Court commissioner derailed that approval by declaring the 
housing portion of the city's general plan invalid. According to state 
regulations, without a valid housing plan, the city cannot approve new 
residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Mayor Victory Grgas had made an unsuccessful, last- ditch effort to 
get the development approved before the new council took office by holding a 
marathon meetings that lasted into the early morning hours. Hastings campaigned 
against the project and joined incumbent Laszlo as a Mola opponent. Forsythe 
was regarded as the swing vote and since she joined the council had questioned 
the safety of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns that the ground may be unsafe to build on had recently held up the 
project. Geologists representing both the developer and the Wetlands 
Restoration Society presented conflicting assessments, and the city eventually 
hired UC Davis geotechnic engineer Kandiah Arulanandan to evaluate the project. 
Arulanandan's report recommended further testing but did not reach any hard 
conclusions about the suitability of the land for housing. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the geological concerns was the earthquake fault running through 
the site and the potential for liquefaction of the soil in the event of a 
quake. Evans, Mola's project director, said the potential for liquefaction on 
the Hellman Ranch site was no greater than in other parts of the city that have 
already been developed. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Winchell, a geologist working on behalf of the Wetlands Restoration 
Society, said earlier that any efforts to offset liquefaction would only be 
"experimental" with no guarantee of success. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no places where these things have been tested," he said at an 
earlier council meeting.

THEY AIM TO 'PUTT' IT ALL AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
DISC GOLF OPEN ATTRACTS SOME OF WORLD'S BEST 
</P>

Eric Jewell eyed his target, then uncorked a soaring shot that curled around a 
tree and landed about 110 yards away, just shy of a hole-in-one. He easily made 
the tap-in "putt" for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, Hale Irwin: Don't move over. Jewell, 26, of Villa Park was 
golfing in a U.S. Open, all right. But he was competing with a plastic disc 
known to most as a Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
"Disc golf" and six separate events lured Jewell and 219 others -- among them 
20 who have set disc "world records" -- to La Mirada Park for what sponsors are 
calling the 1990 U.S. Open Flying Disc Championships. The events will run 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound, well, flighty, but with corporate sponsors providing $42,000 in 
prize money to the top finishers, be assured that this U.S. Open is no joke to 
those involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition is top-notch," said Dan Mangone of Fullerton, the tournament's 
chief organizer. "With 20 current or former world record holders, you can 
imagine how tough it is." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the expansive 27-hole disc-golf layout at the park, Mangone said: 
"It's so unique that people from around the world come to have their pictures 
taken here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the seven competitions that make up this U.S. Open also are distinct -- 
even if some of the terminology and strategies appear to have been borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got decent power, but the main thing in disc golf is, you have to be a 
great putter," said Steve Valencia, 18, a two-time national disc golf champion, 
discussing the sport before he took to the course. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia added something that any weekend hacker with clubs could confirm: "If 
your putting's not on, you're not going to score that effectively." 
</P>
<P>
As with conventional par-three golf, the disc "holes" are typically 300 feet to 
700 feet long. Players must negotiate trees and occasionally water bodies 
before landing their discs in a receptacle roughly five feet above the ground 
that is affixed to a metal pole. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, a graduate of La Mirada High School, said he has already won $5,000 
in disc competitions, plans to enter tournaments later this summer in Texas and 
Missouri. On Monday, he fired the best disc golf round of the field, a 45, or 9 
under par. 
</P>
<P>
The day's most-talked-about achievement, however, came hours earlier at the 
side-arm-shooting hand of Conrad Damon, a computer programmer who said he is 
eschewing the office in Brea this week to manage discs of the airborne genre. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning I tied the world record for accuracy," Damon reported happily. 
</P>
<P>
As with major league baseball's World Series, the disc-throwing crowd goes 
international when describing records. But unlike baseball -- which has yet to 
place a foreign team in its "world" championship games -- the disc-golf open 
has competitors from other nations -- Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, West 
Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 100 spectators showed up for the opening rounds Monday, although 
Mangone said he expects as many as 15,000 for Saturday and Sunday. But those on 
hand Monday appeared to appreciate the expertise of the competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting to see the different solutions they find to the problems," 
said 22-year-old Adrienne Moll of Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most elaborately outfitted competitor was Tim Selinske of Covina, 
whose pull-cart toted a bag of 13 different-size Frisbees (a standard 
assortment for serious players), water and "a flashlight for when this runs 
late." Selinske is one of 15 disc devotees to make the 1990 Guinness Book of 
World Records. 
</P>
<P>
As for Jewell, the entrant from Villa Park, he ended his disc golf round at 2 
under par, placing him among the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a novice up until six months ago," Jewell said. "Now I'm up with the big 
boys, and I'm not winning anything . . . . If I can just find my putter, I'll 
be fine."

CHALLENGE TO SPORTS ARENA IN SANTA ANA THROWN OUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge on Monday threw out a challenge by a citizens group 
opposed to plans for a 20,000-seat sports arena here, clearing the way for 
Santa Ana to resume its race against Anaheim to be the first in Orange County 
to build an indoor sports facility. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials called the decision "a major legal victory" in the city's 
quest to build the arena and attract professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge W.F. Rylaarsdam denied the request of Citizens Against the 
Arena, a group of 12 residents and business owners who had sued Santa Ana and 
the arena developer. The group sought to overturn an amendment to Santa Ana's 
general plan that allows the $70million arena to be built at Edinger Avenue and 
Lyon Street, an area once restricted to office and commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
The group had argued that the city did not have the authority to enter into a 
development agreement for the arena because Santa Ana's previous general plan 
did not allow arenas to be built on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on our way to getting the arena built," said Councilman Miguel A. Pulido 
Jr., whose ward includes the arena site. "We're in a strong position now." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said the court's ruling squashed the strongest 
legal obstacle Santa Ana faced in pursuing the arena plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This pretty much cleans out our legal issues. We're doing fine now," Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Peter A. Seidenberg, who represented the 12 residents, called the 
ruling a "setback." 
</P>
<P>
"We're terribly disappointed," Seidenberg said. "We have lost the first stage 
of proceedings. But we're not going to give up the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Seidenberg said he might appeal Rylaarsdam's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Niles Gates, one of the residents opposed to the arena, said the group will 
continue to try to halt the arena plans. Gates said he has collected more than 
430 signatures from residents who do not want the arena in the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Anaheim City Council will vote today on the financial agreement 
that was negotiated with developer Ogden Corp. of New York. In the proposed 
agreement, Anaheim would be liable for up to $2.5 million a year if its 
proposed 20,000-seat indoor arena operates at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the race between Anaheim and Santa Ana, the first city to build a facility 
is expected to sign with a professional basketball and hockey team. Only one 
arena is expected to survive financially. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana would have fallen behind in negotiations with professional basketball 
franchises if the judge had granted any delay on the arena, said developer 
Anthony V. Guanci, president of King-Guanci Development Co. Inc. of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Guanci said he has meetings scheduled with arena architects next week and is 
negotiating with basketball and hockey teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing it cautious right now because we don't want any wrong moves to 
jeopardize anything. But we're full steam ahead," Guanci said. 
</P>
<P>
Guanci said that he and city officials have almost completed a financial 
agreement, which city officials hope to sign by July. 
</P>
<P>
Both Santa Ana and Anaheim have been slowed down by legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens Against the Arena sued Santa Ana and the developer on May 3. Anaheim's 
project has been on the legal edge numerous times with three lawsuits, filed by 
the Los Angeles Rams, Anaheim Stadium Associates and the owner of a neighboring 
mobile-home park, that challenged the project on environmental grounds. The 
lawsuits, however, were settled out of court in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana arena is to be privately built, operated and owned. The Anaheim 
arena is to be privately built and operated but ultimately owned by the city.

GRAND JURY PRAISES ORANGEWOOD BUT OFFERS SUGGESTIONS

<P>
After a nine-month review, the Orange County Grand Jury concluded Monday that 
managers of the Orangewood Children's Home are sometimes too aloof from shelter 
counselors and that new employees need better training. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, the report praises the staff for their professional and caring 
attitude toward children at the 166-bed Orangewood shelter, which provides a 
temporary home for abused and neglected children in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased that they were thorough in looking at the facility," Orangewood 
director Robert Theemling said. "For the most part, I can live with their 
recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury recommended that managers keep closer ties with counselors, that 
open staff positions be filled as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of 
overtime hours worked by counselors, and that better training and resource 
materials be available to the staff. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury began its study of Orangewood last August as part of its 
responsibility to monitor children's facilities operated by the juvenile court 
system, said Irvin T. Lathrop, chairman of the grand jury committee that 
evaluated Orangewood. No complaint or allegation prompted the review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until last month, however, Orangewood had been under investigation by the 
county Juvenile Justice Commission after complaints were lodged that a male 
counselor had mistreated a teen-age girl and that staff members sometimes 
treated residents with too much regimentation. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report, released May 14, concluded that no evidence existed to 
support the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury committee assisted in the commission's investigation by 
interviewing several people connected with the allegations. However, the grand 
jury committee passed the information on to the Juvenile Justice Commission, 
Lathrop said. The grand jury committee restricted its report to an overall 
review of the Orangewood shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to divorce this report from that (the Juvenile Justice Commission 
investigation) because it had nothing to do with it," Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury review uncovered no major problems with Orangewood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are doing a good job and they have a lot of dedicated, caring people over 
there," he said. The jury's report focused on "things that could make it run 
better and smoother," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Theemling said he disagreed with a criticism in the report that he and Gordon 
Andahl, the home's program manager, are rarely seen around the residential 
units and are unavailable to discuss problems with counselors. Since staffing 
has been short at Orangewood, he and Andahl have regularly filled in as 
counselors during vacant shifts, Theemling said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury recommended that training time for new child-care supervisors increase 
from one week to two weeks -- a plan that has been in the works now for several 
months and might be implemented this fall, Theemling said. Orangewood has 
always wanted to offer more training to new and current staff members, he said, 
"but it doesn't come cheap."

8 CHARGED IN SLAYING OF OFFICER DE LA ROSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed murder and drug 
conspiracy charges Monday against eight people in the slaying of Fullerton 
Police Officer Tommy De La Rosa during an undercover drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
The seven men and one woman are suspected members of the drug ring that was 
being investigated by De La Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
Though not all were involved in the shooting, prosecutors said all eight face 
murder charges under the state's "felony-murder rule," meaning that anyone 
involved in the commission of a felony -- in this case, conspiracy to purchase 
cocaine for sale -- are held accountable for the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start going down that road . . . (and) if someone ends up being 
killed, then you should be held accountable," Deputy Dist. Atty. Frederick P. 
Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa, 43, was killed last Thursday in Downey. The officer was shot five 
times when the gunmen opened fire as he stepped from a car to deliver a 
promised 200-kilogram shipment of cocaine in exchange for $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the suspects never intended to pay for the drugs and planned to rob 
De La Rosa, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
Before dying, De La Rosa shot and killed one suspect, Joseph Najera Rodriguez, 
35, of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Those charged Monday in Downey were Omar Yuriar Noriega, 23; Raul Meza, 49; 
Jerome Leon Sanchez, 29; Jesus Rodriguez Pena, 22; Ydalvys Escobar, 38; Luis 
Plantillas Benetez, 37; Miguel Leon Escobar, 34, and Frederico Edward Marriott. 
Horn said they were all Mexican nationals and gave addresses either in Bell, El 
Monte, Placentia or Downey. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Noriega, Meza, Sanchez and Pena were charged with two counts each 
of "special circumstances," including murder while lying in wait and murder 
during a robbery. The additional charges make them eligible for the death 
penalty, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the defendants all appeared before Municipal Judge Richard C. 
Cumming in a crowded courtroom where authorities used metal detectors to screen 
spectators for weapons. Their arraignment was delayed until July 2 to give 
public defenders and court-appointed attorneys time to prepare their cases. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass was held for De La Rosa, a father of four, Monday evening at St. Angela 
Merici Catholic Church in Brea. Funeral services are at 11 a.m. today at First 
Evangelical Free Church, 2801 Brea Blvd. in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
After the funeral, a motorcade will proceed to Memory Gardens Memorial Park at 
455 W. Central Ave., Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, 13 suspects were arrested but five had been released by Monday. 
Those released included a woman and a 17-year-old juvenile from Fullerton, Horn 
said.TED JOHNSON

A proposal to stiffen the penalties for violating Brea's noise ordinance was 
itself the cause of some noise among City Council members at their meeting last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had proposed changing the city's municipal code to make 
violating the noise limits a misdemeanor, rather than the infraction it is 
under current city law. 
</P>
<P>
The change, officials said, would make enforcement of the noise ordinance 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of a city prosecutor last year, Brea now has the mechanism 
for enforcing the ordinance in court, staff members told the council. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Ron Isles questioned the need for the stiffer charge if, as the 
staff reported, 95% of the violations are handled effectively as infractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there some way we can make (violating the ordinance) an infraction on the 
first offense and a misdemeanor for second offenders?" Isles asked. 
</P>
<P>
While City Manager Frank Benest assured the council that the city does give 
plenty of warning to offenders before even citing them with an infraction, both 
Isles and Mayor Carrey J. Nelson criticized the amendment and asked the staff 
to research changing only the second offense to a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The council will take the issue up again at its July 3 meeting. DANIELLE A.

MAN TELLS POLICE OF RACIAL ASSAULT

<P>
Three apparent "skinheads" allegedly assaulted a Huntington Beach man Monday in 
a racially motivated incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old victim, who is black, walked into the Police Department and 
told officers that he was attacked about 7:45 a.m. in the back parking lot of a 
shopping center at 8901 Warner Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was not identified, said the suspects were working on a car 
when one of them yelled a racial slur at him. He said he yelled back at the 
group, and they then "assaulted, beat and kicked" him, Police Sgt. Luis Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim received scrapes and bruises," he reported. 
</P>
<P>
The man managed to run away after one of the suspects threatened him with a 
knife, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
Skinheads, so called because of their extremely short hair, are known for their 
white supremacist beliefs and violent behavior, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mary Ann Gaido of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, 
hate crimes "appear to be on the upswing." 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission has no statistics on the hate crimes, Gaido said, the 
number of incidents reported to the commission has increased in the last couple 
of years. She said, however, that there "have not been too many reports of this 
type of assault." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hate crimes reported in the county have consisted of derogatory 
leaflets and name-calling, Gaido said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating Monday's incident.MATT LAIT

ESTANCIA HIGH POOL CLOSED FOR SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Estancia High School swimming pool will not be open to the public this 
summer because of a shortage of water-safety instructors, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the shortage of instructors, the pool also experienced a 
decrease in the number of people signing up for swim classes, said Costa Mesa 
Aquatics Director Tom Edson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair, but our community is sort of divided between rich and poor," 
Edson said. "It's based on the mere fact that they have had one-third to 
one-fourth of the enrollment we need to keep it open. They may have been unable 
to afford the fees in the first place." The fees started at $30 for a two-week 
class. 
</P>
<P>
After deciding to close the pool to the public, Edson tried to keep it open for 
a summer swimming team for children 11 through 14. However, too few children 
showed up for the first practice. 
</P>
<P>
A shortage of instructors has also led other Orange County cities to close 
their pools and to reduce the number of class offerings. 
</P>
<P>
City officials cite a number of reasons for the shortages, including low wages 
and changes in Red Cross training requirements. (The Red Cross trains the 
majority of the area's lifeguards and swimming teachers.) MARY ANNE PEREZ

ROBBINS IMPERILED LAND DEAL, SUIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins warned a Newport Beach businessman trying to buy and 
develop choice property near Marina del Rey that he "would never get" a crucial 
government permit because the lawmaker wanted to acquire the land himself, the 
businessman has charged in court papers filed in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Blake also said Robbins (D-Tarzana) boasted that he had former Los 
Angeles City Council President Pat Russell "tied up" in connection with his 
efforts from 1985 to 1987 to buy 16 acres along Lincoln Boulevard. The property 
is subject to city planning rules. 
</P>
<P>
Blake's allegations are contained in documents filed recently as part of a 
complex web of civil lawsuits involving Blake, Robbins and a wealthy La Jolla 
car dealer, Jeremy Simms. The three were partners in a 3,800-acre parcel of 
Ventura County land that sold last year for $22 million. The profits from the 
sale also are a subject of the suits. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation -- which already includes a stack of paper work more than three 
feet high -- recently prompted the state attorney general's office to reopen a 
1988 investigation that cleared Robbins of allegations that he illegally used 
campaign funds to help finance the Ventura County deal. 
</P>
<P>
No trial dates have been set in the suits, the bulk of which are pending in 
Santa Monica Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Robbins denied that he tried to thwart Blake over the Lincoln 
Boulevard land. He said he didn't even meet Blake until after he, Robbins, had 
signed a deal to purchase the first group of properties. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Robbins and a different partner purchased the 
land for $12.2 million and sold it last year for a reported $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran lawmaker amassed a considerable fortune before and during his 17 
years in the state Senate. He is a lawyer and licensed real estate broker, and 
he and a succession of partners have financed apartment complexes, medical 
buildings and office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Blake said in court papers that Robbins complained that Blake's attempts to buy 
the land were "messing up" efforts by Robbins' firm, Marina East Holding 
Properties, to acquire it. 
</P>
<P>
Blake said Robbins told him that the property could be developed only if the 
successful buyer "got a left-turn lane authorized for entrance and various 
other governmental approvals." 
</P>
<P>
"He added that if I got the property, and his group lost it, I would never get 
the left-hand turn lane and might have a difficult time in obtaining other 
required approvals," Blake said in the court papers. "He told me that if we 
took the property from him, he would make sure it would not be worth our 
while." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said, however, that the property Blake was trying to buy actually was a 
different property. 
</P>
<P>
He said Blake wanted to build a hotel on the land and asked Robbins for 
permission to build a driveway through Robbins' lots. The lawmaker agreed, but 
Blake was never able to carry out the hotel deal, Robbins said. JACK CHEEVERS

WORTHLESS CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I read the article on the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit 
physical desecration of the flag (June 22), I see, as true to form, our Orange 
County gang of five congressmen crawled out of their bomb shelters to cast a 
yea vote on the flag amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it amazing that these five insecure individuals have so little confidence 
in our governmental institutions and the people that they would agree to 
jeopardize our Bill of Rights to vote for this worthless amendment? 
</P>
<P>
When, if ever, will Orange County get an independent congressman who will not 
be led around by the nose of the incumbent administration?

CALDERON HAS RIGHT MOVE AT RIGHT TIME

Ivan Calderon told it like he saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have a chance," Calderon said. "When I got the ball he was running 
to home plate, and I said, 'He's out."' 
</P>
<P>
With the Angels trailing the Chicago White Sox, 2-0, with two out in the ninth 
Monday, Chili Davis was trying to score from second base on Luis Polonia's 
pinch-hit single to left. 
</P>
<P>
He was out by a long shot, and the White Sox had their fifth victory in a row 
against the Oakland Athletics or the Angels, their chief competition in the 
American League West. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and runners on first and second, and with two strikes on the 
left-handed Polonia, Calderon had moved toward the left-field line, perhaps 
within 15 or 20 feet of it. 
</P>
<P>
The adjustment might have made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"With two strikes, we move to the line," Calderon said. "He's just trying to 
make contact." 
</P>
<P>
The outfield assist helped save the game -- as did Bobby Thigpen, who got the 
final two outs for his 24th save, best in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was Calderon's victim -- and not just once. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon threw him out at third in the fourth inning as Davis tried to take two 
bases on Lance Parrish's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time he has had two assists in a game, Calderon said. But 
Terry Bevington, one of the White Sox coaches, was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been anybody in this league who is playing better defensively," 
Bevington said. "He knows where to play the batters. You never have to remind 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon feigned no surprise, either. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I've been playing, I think I'm the best left fielder playing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox were supposed to get their comeuppance when they played Oakland 
and the Angels in back-to-back series in Comiskey Park beginning June 14. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as if they had. After winning the first game against Oakland, the 
White Sox lost their next five games in a row, losing three to the A's and two 
to the Angels before beating the Angels in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
Then they went on the road, and they haven't lost yet, sweeping the Athletics 
over the weekend and opening this three-game series with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
They have gone from washed-up to praiseworthy. 
</P>
<P>
"What are they saying now that we've won (five) in a row?" Manager Jeff Torborg 
said. "What does that mean? We could lose four in a row next." 
</P>
<P>
But they have made a habit of winning the close ones. 
</P>
<P>
They are 26-13 in games decided by two runs or less -- including Monday's. 
</P>
<P>
"We never quit," Calderon said. "We play to the end." 
</P>
<P>
But despite their recent run of success, Torborg says the White Sox aren't 
developing any of the swagger that Oakland is so famous for. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're playing hard," he said. "You don't swagger until you've won it 
all. Even then, you don't swagger." 
</P>
<P>
He forgot to mention that to Calderon.

It seemed a perfect fit to Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco is hampered by a hand injury, and the Oakland Athletics might need 
an extra bat. Downing saw himself as the answer, though it would mean leaving 
the Angels after more than 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd break my heart," Downing said, "but hell, so would this." 
</P>
<P>
Downing conceded Monday that this scenario has little chance of occurring, but 
he feels he has been unjustly cast aside by the team for which he has played 
more games (1,595) than any other player. 
</P>
<P>
His appearance in Monday's lineup was his 30th in 72 games and he carried in a 
.228 average, his highest since the first week of the season. However, he said 
he would not ask to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he intend to quit. "I wish I could. I'm not man enough to do that and 
a lot of people would be very disappointed in me if I do that," said Downing, 
who will be 40 in October and is in the last year of a contract that pays him 
$1.25 million. "If that had been true, I'd have been out of here several months 
ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of got tired of the indifference. Everybody was so quick to write 
me off and treat me like a piece of (dirt). That's all. If I had any doubt 
(about my abilities), I certainly wouldn't volunteer to play for the Oakland 
A's, would I?" 
</P>
<P>
Angels General Manager Mike Port, who met with Downing about a month ago to 
discuss his future, was returning to California from New York on Monday and 
could not be reached for comment. Manager Doug Rader said Downing's situation 
had been settled a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian's changed his mind, but I don't feel a public forum is the place to 
comment," Rader said. "He's a member of the 25-man roster and as such he's a 
member of a team. Everybody that's part of the team needs to be counted on to 
produce. That's how I look at Brian, Wally Joyner, Kent Anderson or Mark 
Eichhorn. . . . My responsibility is to do the best I can for the team using 
all the tools available to me." 
</P>
<P>
Downing said he can't physically play defense for a National League team and 
thought Oakland made sense because it's next-closest to Anaheim among American 
League teams. 
</P>
<P>
He added he was not seeking a trade to a contending team just to reach the 
World Series, because "it wouldn't be like getting a ring with a halo on it." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to play or they shouldn't be here," said Downing, who said 
this would be his last season. "I don't want to do this again.' 
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's not like I'm a malcontent or anything. I've kept pretty quiet. 
It's not a lot of fun. I don't see myself sitting on the bench spitting 
sunflower seeds and scraping pine tar. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel like I can do a lot and I thought the opportunity might be there 
in a great situation. I'd thought about it for some time but there never was an 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
"It just so happened I heard on TV and said, 'That's a possible fit.' I never 
would have considered it a couple of months ago. But you hear things and read 
things and it wears on you. I have a lot of pride and respect. It's probably 
dead now, but I don't take it back. I really don't serve much purpose here."

KOLL CO. TO BUILD $40-MILLION, MIXED-USE PROJECT ON 33 ACRES 
</P>

The Koll Co. of Newport Beach announced plans Monday for a $40-million, 
33-acre, mixed-use development project in this booming Riverside County bedroom 
community, with the Keith Cos. of Costa Mesa signed on as the first major 
tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the Koll Corporate Center, the project will provide space for office, 
industrial and retail businesses, and is scheduled for ground breaking in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The city, eager to provide more local employment opportunities for its rapidly 
growing population, will contribute $2 million to $3 million in infrastructure 
improvements around the site. 
</P>
<P>
The Keith Cos., a land planning and engineering firm, has agreed to a 
$5-million lease for 50,000 square feet of space in the project's 
63,000-square-foot office building, and will relocate its 100-employee Inland 
Empire division to the site. 
</P>
<P>
Debi Hausdorfer, a Keith Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm also has an equity 
interest in the project, but she declined to provide details. An investment 
partnership called Oak Springs Inc. also has a stake in the venture, and the 
Industrial Bank of Japan will be the construction lender. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the project will follow previous Koll Co. mixed-use developments, 
with a unified architectural and landscape theme aimed at creating a 
"city-within-a-city" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the office building, the development will include a 
135,000-square-foot, multitenant industrial building, a 26,000-square-foot 
retail building and a 100-room hotel. Twelve acres of undeveloped property will 
be offered for build-to-suit or sale to either office or industrial tenants, 
and the entire project is slated for completion by 1994.

Quality Systems Inc.: The Tustin computer company reported a loss of $849,600 
for the fiscal year ended March 31, contrasted with the loss of $313,500 
reported for the previous year. Revenue rose 9%, to $9.6 million from $8.8 
million. The company said that new product introductions during the fiscal year 
resulted in higher expenses that offset the revenue increase.

PATENT FIGHT APPEARS OVER, TO THE RELIEF OF 2 LOCAL COMPANIES

At least two Orange County computer companies are sighing with relief with the 
news that the patent dispute between Motorola Inc. and Japanese electronics 
giant Hitachi Ltd. was tentatively settled out of court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Both Alpha Microsystems in Santa Ana and General Automation Inc. in Anaheim 
make computers that use Motorola's 68030 microprocessor, a brain that controls 
computing functions, which was the subject of the dispute between the two chip 
makers. The dispute also threatened to cause serious consequences for companies 
such as Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems, which depend on a steady 
supply of 68030 chips for manufacturing their personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., depends on the chip for more than $100 
million in annual sales, according to semiconductor industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a federal judge in Austin, Tex., entered an order to enforce an 
injunction he issued in March temporarily barring both companies from selling 
the chips involved in the court case in the United States pending a resolution 
of the dispute. Last Friday, Motorola filed documents in federal court in 
Washington seeking a permanent stay of the Texas judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Motorola said it had reached a preliminary settlement agreement with 
Hitachi. Neither company disclosed details of the tentative agreement. 
</P>
<P>
John S. Cain, president and chief executive of Alpha Microsystems, said his 
company was concerned about the battle because one its lines of business 
computers uses the Motorola chip. He noted, however, that his company is not 
dependent on the chip because several of its other models use other Motorola 
chips not involved in the Hitachi suit. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation officials expressed far more concern about the 
Motorola-Hitachi case because their company's most powerful machines, the 8000 
Series of minicomputers, are based on the Motorola chip. Further, the company 
had also planned to convert the remainder of its business computer line to the 
68030 chip in November, said John Howorth, General Automation vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief to know the dispute is finally concluded," Howorth said. "But we 
were confident that the stakes were so high for Motorola that they would do 
nothing that could interrupt the supply. We were surprised the legal action 
went as far as it did."

Entertaining the family can run into big bucks, but the Yorba Linda Parks and 
Recreation Department is serving up an affordable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Two family-oriented productions, complete with free ice cream at intermission, 
will be offered over the next three Saturday evenings as part of the city's 
1990 Summer Theater on the Green series. 
</P>
<P>
For a donation of $1 per person, families can stretch out under the stars at 
Hurless Barton Park and see a performance of the comedy "Cheaper by the Dozen" 
Saturday or the musical "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" July 7 or 14. 
</P>
<P>
In the Spotlight, a Yorba Linda-based actors' training program for children 3 
to 18, is producing the series, which opened with "Cheaper" Saturday to a 
capacity audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We think theater is something that families should experience together," said 
Robyn Naylor, executive producer of the series. The park setting "gives us all 
a chance to be out under the stars and start to appreciate the theatrical 
experience without a lot of expense and hassle." 
</P>
<P>
"Cheaper" is based on the book of reminiscences by Frank Gilbreth Jr. and 
Ernestine Gilbreth Carey about their father, a jocular efficiency expert who 
had his own theories about how to rear his 12-child family. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gilbreth Sr., Naylor said, "figured you could take these dozen children, 
train them properly, send them out into the world, and they would all do just 
fine. It's a fun, accessible story about the real-life adventures of being a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
The play is set in the 1920s. The Spotlight production features an 18-member 
cast of youngsters ages 6 through 16 directed by Judy Sofer, a member of the 
Spotlight teaching staff. Naylor designed the period costumes, and Fullerton 
Civic Light Opera volunteers built the sets. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor's students also compose the cast of "Charlie Brown," the Broadway 
musical based on the child characters in the Charles Schulz comic strip. Paul 
Haggerty is the director for the musical. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor said she is coordinating the series at no charge to the city in order to 
give her young actors "the maximum opportunity to perform." 
</P>
<P>
"This outdoor experience will be totally different for them," she noted. "For 
example, there are no blackouts, so they had to learn how to exit by just 
walking quietly off the stage. It's a good lesson for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, we're always telling our kids that the talent they have is a gift, and 
they need to have every chance they can to give the gift to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheaper by the Dozen" and "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" are 
presentations of the Yorba Linda Parks and Recreation Department Summer Theater 
on the Green series. "Cheaper" will be presented Saturday and "Charlie Brown" 
July 7 and 14 at Hurless Barton Park, Casa Loma Avenue between Yorba Linda 
Boulevard and Imperial Highway. Admission is free but officials ask donations 
of $1 per person. Show times are 7:30 p.m. Information: (714) 961-7160.

BUSH BARS NEW OFFSHORE OIL LEASES OFF 99% OF CALIF. COAST AND FLORIDA; 
</P>
<P>
CALLS FOR MORE STEPS TO SAVE ENVIRONMENT BEFORE YEAR 2000

<P>
President Bush, in a politically sensitive decision, today barred new oil 
leasing off much of California and Florida, the North Atlantic coast, 
Washington and Oregon until after the year 2000. "Further steps to protect the 
environment are needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also canceled planned government oil lease sales in an area stretching 
south from San Francisco to Monterey Bay and said he will permanently block any 
drilling in a 2,200-square-mile proposed marine sanctuary that lies within that 
region. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush said tracts in the Santa Maria Basin and Santa Barbara Channel 
off Southern California will be available for leasing consideration at the 
beginning of 1996 if studies show the environment can be protected there. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is the only area involved in Bush's decision today where 
oil drilling is now going on. 
</P>
<P>
"The combined effect of these decisions is that the coast of southwest Florida 
and more than 99% of the California coast will be off-limits to oil and gas 
leasing and development until after the year 2000," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, Bush's decision shores up his effort to portray himself as the 
"environmental President" and helps Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) in his run for 
governor this year. Opinion polls have shown that most Californians oppose 
offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
called Bush's decision "a major step in the right direction." But she said "it 
falls short in several crucial respects." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists want a permanent ban imposed on offshore drilling. Spear 
complained that Bush did not address some areas where lease sales are upcoming, 
including the Mid-Atlantic coast, North Carolina, New Jersey, Alaska's Bristol 
Bay and northern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Florida, where the government already has sold 73 leases to oil 
firms in an area off the Florida Keys, Bush said he is directing Interior 
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to begin a process that "may lead to the buy-back 
and cancellation of existing leases." 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, "Any development after the year 2000 would be pursued only if 
it appears viable based on the guiding principles" of environmental protection, 
energy needs and significant potential for oil production. 
</P>
<P>
Along the New England coast, Bush announced a delay that Administration 
officials already had signaled. He said a sale of leases in the Georges Bank 
area east of Cape Cod, Mass., will be canceled until at least 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"This will allow time for additional studies to determine the resource 
potential of the area and address the environmental and scientific concerns 
which have been raised," Bush said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Bush's long-awaited decision calls for canceling all planned 
government sales in Northern California, and in Southern California south of 
the Santa Barbara Channel, so new oceanographic and socioeconomic studies can 
be conducted. These areas could not be considered for new leases until after 
2000.

Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, freed by a government eager to improve ties with 
the West, said today he will continue to work for "progress and development" in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, arrived in Britain Monday night after the 
Chinese government agreed to permit them to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had sought refuge there after the Chinese government's June 4, 1989, 
military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
"As citizens of China, we hope to do whatever we can in the future to help 
China's continuing progress and development," Fang said in a statement issued 
through the Royal Society in London. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after the society canceled tentative plans to present 
Fang at a news conference.

Writer Salman Rushdie, who has been sentenced to die by Iranian zealots, has 
donated $8,600 to victims of last week's devastating earthquake in Iran. Iran 
said today his death order still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie donated the money to the Independent Iranian Earthquake Appeal, 
organized by the Independent newspaper to help survivors of the earthquake that 
Iranian officials said left at least 50,000 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to join the Independent and the hostage families and many other 
people in their appeal for contributions toward the needs of the Iranian 
earthquake victims," Rushdie said in a message delivered from his hiding place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear that at the moment, we should be thinking only of the 
humanitarian issue, which transcends all other discussion," said Rushdie, 42. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian-born writer has been out of public view since Feb. 14, 1989, when 
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced him to death for writing "The 
Satanic Verses," a novel many Muslims regard as blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
"The foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid from Salman 
Rushdie to earthquake victims, we will compromise on Rushdie's fatwa (edict)," 
Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, known as the "Hanging Judge," said in Tehran. He 
indicated they would not.

A 38-year-old man was gored to death today when he tripped and fell during the

<P>
The running of the bulls in this town of 12,000 people 149 miles west of Madrid

In the ritual, the bulls are turned loose before dawn in the town's sealed-off 
streets, and young men race ahead of them. The bulls are killed in bullfights 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Many small towns and cities across Spain maintain the tradition. But in recent 
years, there has been growing opposition from Spanish and foreign groups to 
bullfights and the running of the bulls on the grounds that the practices 
constitute cruelty to animals.

HUNGARY VOTES TO LEAVE WARSAW PACT BY 1992

The Hungarian Parliament voted unanimously today in favor of Hungary's 
withdrawal from the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact by the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament approved a motion submitted a month ago by the liberal Free 
Democrats, and amended later in two parliamentary committees, with 232 votes 
for and none against. 
</P>
<P>
There were four abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
All six political parties represented in the chamber were in favor of the 
proposal, which binds the government to start negotiations with Warsaw Pact 
members on Hungary's withdrawal from the Soviet-led military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"The Warsaw Pact has no reason to exist any more," Deputy Foreign Minister 
Tomas Katona told parliament, noting that the government supported the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Katona said the desired goal would be the total dissolution of the pact by a 
joint resolution. But if other members want to sustain it, Hungary would 
withdraw from the organization by the end of 1991 at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
Katona said Hungary should proceed carefully during the negotiations to avoid 
endangering the Vienna disarmament talks and the current Soviet troop 
withdrawals from Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned that unless the negotiations were circumspect, there was a 
danger that Hungary would be isolated and wedged between the Warsaw Pact and 
NATO.

An Israeli human rights group said today that Palestinian youths held by police 
for alleged security offenses were housed in overcrowded cells and subjected to 
routine violence. 
</P>
<P>
B'Tselem, an independent human rights monitoring group, said it found "serious 
flaws in every aspect of the manner in which the Israeli police handle the 
detention and interrogation of Palestinian minors." 
</P>
<P>
The report focused on overcrowding in the Russian Compound police station in 
the center of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the International Assn. for the Rights of the Child visited 
the Russian Compound in March and found 39 youths in a cell with 12 beds. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every minor we interviewed testified that he had been beaten, usually 
severely -- slaps, punches, kicks, hair-pulling, blows with clubs and iron bars 
-- and pushed to the wall and to the floor," the report said.

EC REFUSES TO EASE S. AFRICAN SANCTIONS;

TRADE BLOC RENOUNCES VIOLENCE IN A REBUKE AIMED AT A.N.C.

The 12-nation European Community today called on all South Africans to renounce 
violence in a declaration that Britain said was directed squarely at Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But the leaders of the trade bloc, at the end of a two-day summit, refused to 
ease sanctions against South Africa's white-led government, saying they need 
"further clear evidence" that changes to end apartheid will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Mandela was being lionized on a visit to the United 
States, where he called for sanctions to be maintained. But Mandela also caused 
unease in Washington by his continued refusal to renounce violence. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was a "great pity" that the EC 
nations were "unable to agree publicly to make a start now on easing 
sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
"What they have done is something I am very pleased about," she added. "They 
have condemned pretty clearly anyone who advocates violence . . . and that goes 
straight to the armed struggle in no uncertain terms, and that ought to be 
abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the refusal to lift sanctions, South Africa's government welcomed the 
EC statement. 
</P>
<P>
"What the declaration says, albeit not is so many words, is that South Africa 
has regained international respectability," Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) 
Botha said in Pretoria. "The use of violence is rejected," he added. "By 
implication, this means that the ANC's adherence to the armed struggle is 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of South African sanctions, the community said it "affirms its 
willingness to consider a gradual relaxation of this pressure when there is 
further clear evidence that the process of change already initiated continues." 
</P>
<P>
"The European Council calls on all parties . . . to refrain from violence or 
advocacy of violence," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders described South African President Frederik W. de Klerk as a man of 
"foresight and courage" and said Mandela has "inspired millions of South 
Africans opposed to apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
But in effect, the community stuck to a position adopted at a summit in 
Strasbourg, France, six months ago. Since then, De Klerk has begun a reform 
program, including releasing Mandela after 27 years in jail, legalizing the ANC 
and scrapping some apartheid laws.

The Vatican said today that open dissent cannot be tolerated and ordered 
theologians to refrain from publicly challenging church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
A major document issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith 
replied in strong terms to Western theologians who have questioned the Roman 
Catholic Church's ban on artificial birth control, stand on papal authority and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"To succumb to the temptation of dissent . . . is to allow the leaven of 
infidelity to the Holy Spirit to start to work," said the report, approved by 
Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
The document defended punitive action taken against dissidents and said 
theologians must adhere to doctrine whether it is infallible or not. It 
rejected the notion that the church should leave moral and sexual matters to 
personal choice or conscience. 
</P>
<P>
It warned dissenters against making their complaints in the media or trying to 
influence public opinion.

The Du Pont Co. announced today that it has received government approval to 
market the first Soviet drug licensed and clinically developed by an American 
pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the Food and Drug Administration agreed to permit the use of 
Ethmozine for the treatment of abnormal and life-threatening heart rhythms 
known as ventricular arrhythmias. 
</P>
<P>
These irregular heartbeats are caused by heart attack, coronary artery blockage 
and other disorders and are blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Mullane, director of drug development for Du Pont, said the drug was 
discovered in the late 1960s in Moscow and has been available in the Soviet 
Union for about 18 years.

BREATHER FOR TRUMP IN $20-MILLION LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
SHORT-TERM DEAL AVERTS DEFAULT AT MIDNIGHT ON BONDS

Donald Trump averted the collapse of his debt-heavy real estate and casino 
empire at the 11th hour today by winning $20 million in short-term financing 
from his banks, banking sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The payment will allow Trump to make a crucial interest payment on bonds due at 
midnight and give him breathing space to begin restructuring his cash-strapped 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Trump had met with his bankers for weeks to get $65 million but had run into 
opposition from some lenders who did not want to participate in the new loans. 
In the end, seven banks agreed to the larger loan and released a $20-million 
portion immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The $20-million financing package gives Trump all the working capital he needs 
to avert bankruptcy," a banker said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who rose to financial fame in the 1980s, found his debt-heavy empire 
stumbling once the New York real estate market flattened out and the Atlantic 
City, N.J., casino marketplace was glutted with an oversupply of gaming halls. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a shortage of cash to cover his debts, which include an 
estimated $2 billion in bank loans and $1.3 billion in junk bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers now expect Trump to slim down his lavish lifestyle and begin shedding 
some of the money-losing properties in his vast real estate portfolio that 
stretches from Palm Beach, Fla., to Fifth Avenue in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Trump will also grant the bankers second mortgages and additional security on a 
batch of New York apartments and an airplane, those in the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank loan talks floundered in the last few days as Japanese, French and 
German banks refused to go along with the deal. But the Japanese caved in 
earlier this week, and bankers said Societe Generale, a French bank, backed the 
deal by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
Even after hours of late night bank talks and additional meetings this morning, 
West Germany's Dresdner Bank AG still would not go along with the loan, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
It had lent $15 million for the Trump Tower in New York and did not want to go 
along with a second mortgage on the property that would dilute its security. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer in the talks said that the consent of Dresdner was not absolutely 
necessary to arrange the $20-million bridge loan, so the banks went forward 
without the West German bank. 
</P>
<P>
With $20 million secured, Trump now has another 30 days to complete the 
complicated deal to obtain the rest of the $65 million, a package that has 
involved negotiations with more than 50 banks worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers 
Hanover Corp., First Fidelity Bancorp, Midlantic Corp. and National Westminster 
Bank PLC are all lending the fresh money to Trump. 
</P>
<P>
The financing allows Trump to make an interest payment now 11 days overdue on 
bonds from the Trump Castle.

A Foreign Ministry spokesman today acknowledged that the Soviet Union is having 
trouble paying $2 billion in foreign bills but asked for more Western credits 
to help move toward a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're experiencing some commercial difficulties now," the spokesman, Gennady 
I. Gerasimov, told a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our perfectly immaculate record on the external market of always paying our 
debts is now under question." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov quoted the Soviet State Bank president, Viktor Gerashchenko, as 
saying the Soviet Union has a current accounts deficit, the difference between 
cash on hand and outstanding bills, of $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
He said this was due to several factors, including the disruption involved in 
the transition from central planning to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its current difficulties paying its bills, Gerasimov said the Soviet 
Union needs more Western economic credits like the $3.1-billion West German 
bank credit backed by the Bonn government this week. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have credits, it will be easier for us to have economic reform," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
European Community leaders meeting in Dublin this week agreed to help the 
ailing Soviet economy but first ordered aides to consult with the Kremlin about 
proposals for both short-term loans and long-term assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders fended off a request by France and West Germany to adopt an 
immediate $15-billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the Soviet Union's economic potential should be sufficient 
collateral guaranteeing repayment of large-scale economic credits.

Continental Bank Corp., which stumbled in its foray into fields outside 
traditional banking, said today it will eliminate certain product lines and 
reduce its staff by 900 people. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based bank holding company, which employs 6,720, also said it will 
set aside $50 million to cover the costs of cutting the product lines and 
staff, which will result in a loss for its second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, the nation's 18th-largest bank, said it will cut certain products, 
including futures and options execution and clearing as well as foreign 
exchange and U.S. government bond trading in Tokyo for its own account. 
</P>
<P>
The bank said it intends to continue operations in financial risk management, 
debt distribution and customized corporate finance activities, in addition to 
private banking and treasury management businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Bank, formerly known as Continental Illinois Corp., was once the 
nation's largest bailout case. In 1984, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. put 
up $4.5 billion in cash and guarantees to rescue the Chicago bank when rumors 
of Continental's impending insolvency frightened institutions into withdrawing 
huge deposits.

The farm where Lawrence Welk learned to play the accordion became center stage 
today for a project to create a museum honoring the king of champagne music. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Sinner and other state officials attended a groundbreaking ceremony 
at the farm where Welk lived until he was 21. 
</P>
<P>
The bandleader himself, now 87 and living in Los Angeles, did not attend but 
sent a letter of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Little did I dream when I was growing up on the farm so many, many years ago 
that someday it would be restored and people would come and marvel at how life 
was lived in the early 1920s," Welk wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, I would say that life on the farm was very hard and I didn't 
always like it -- especially when I had to help butcher the hogs. But they were 
really happy days, too, because there was always love." 
</P>
<P>
The farm has been vacant since 1966. But folks in this town of 600 -- about 75 
miles south of Bismarck -- decided to refurbish the farm to chronicle Welk's 
achievements and the history of his German-Russian ancestors.

The Marine Corps isn't the only U.S. military branch in Southern California to 
restrict the sale of rap group 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit album "As Nasty 
As They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead last week of Marine officials at Camp Pendleton near 
Oceanside, U.S. Navy officials confirmed today that five naval bases in the San 
Diego area have been instructed to stop selling the album. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Petty Officer Martin Wicklund, a spokesman for the Naval Basecin San 
Diego, said the Fleet Support Office (the agency that oversees all Navy 
exchange operations in San Diego) has directed base commanding officers to 
remove the Miami rappers' controversial "Nasty" album, as well as all other 2 
Live Crew recordings. 
</P>
<P>
The decision covers exchange outlets at Miramar, North Island, Naval Station 
San Diego, the Naval Training Center and the Naval Outlying Landing Field at 
Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But, as of today, the album was still available to sailors in Long Beach and 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Steven Chesser, a spokesman for the Long Beach Naval Station, said 
the Long Beach exchange officer has not been instructed to remove the album.

The 19-year-old son of Mayor Maynard Jackson apologized for knocking down his 
girlfriend on a street, but it wasn't enough to keep him out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Harvey Moskowitz on Monday upheld a charge of disorderly 
conduct and ordered Maynard Jackson III to complete a 45-day sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has been in jail since soon after the June 18 incident involving Maria 
Norma Duarte, 30. He was charged with pushing her to the ground after trying to 
grab her can of Mace. It was his third arrest this year. "I know I was wrong," 
he told the judge. "I should have held back my temper."

Doctors at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh have been evaluating the girl for

Reigning Wimbledon tennis champion Steffi Graf says she is considering moving 
to the United States and boycotting events in West Germany because of lurid 
newspaper headlines linking her father to a topless model. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to have to say this, but I hate these people," the No. 1-ranked 
women's tennis player was quoted as saying in the latest edition of the West 
German news magazine Stern. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never stop hating these people who want to destroy my family just to 
boost the circulation of their newspapers," Graf added. 
</P>
<P>
West German tabloid newspapers have splashed stories of her father Peter, 52, 
and nude model Nicole Meissner, 22, over their front pages, complete with 
eye-catching photographs of the unclad woman. 
</P>
<P>
In the Stern interview, Graf attributed her losses in the French and German 
Open tournaments to anxiety over the stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give up tennis . . . but I might go to America and temporarily 
not play in Germany if the newspapers hurt me and my family again in the future 
with their headlines," she said.

Police are being cautious but said today they plan no special security steps at 
Wimbledon in response to a terrorist bombing at a posh London club. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists said they are concerned but not enough to stay away from the tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about it, but you can't go through life worrying about things like 
that," said Adelaide Woodward of San Diego. "We choose not to think about 
things like that. If it happens, it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Woodward and her husband, Jim, were walking in front of the Carlton Club, the 
scene of Monday night's bombing, an hour before the incident, on their way to 
see "The Phantom of the Opera." But the possibility that Wimbledon would be a 
prime location for terrorists to act didn't scare away the Woodwards or other 
tennis fans. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector Ray Dunne, head of police operations for Wimbledon, said no 
added security measures are being taken because of the Carlton Club bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a large sporting event and we take the precautions we normally take," 
Dunne said. "You can't guarantee security; that would be a Utopia. You can only 
take what precautions you can."

OILERS' ROZIER IS TARGET OF SECOND PATERNITY SUIT

<P>
Houston Oilers running back Mike Rozier has been named in a paternity suit for 
the second time in a month by women who each contend he is the father of their 
unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
The latest suit was filed Monday by Rita Baldwin, 25, who contends Rozier is 
the father of her baby, according to lawyer Glenn Lilly, who also represents 
Pamela Gobert, 23, who filed a paternity suit against Rozier earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, an unemployed student in Dickinson, said in the suit filed in Harris 
County Family District Court that she is expecting a baby in September. 
</P>
<P>
Gobert is four months' pregnant, Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Both women are seeking medical costs and child support for their children, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rozier has 21 days to respond to Baldwin's suit and until July 16 to respond to 
Gobert's petition. If he contests fatherhood of either child, Lilly will ask 
the court to order medical tests to determine paternity. 
</P>
<P>
Rozier so far has paid for the initial doctor's visits for both the women, 
Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin apparently was unaware of Rozier's relationship with Gobert, Lilly 
said. He described the Baldwin-Rozier relationship as "girlfriend on and off 
for some time." 
</P>
<P>
"Rita (Baldwin) obviously feels lied to and deceived by Mike Rozier," the 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Rozier signed a one-year contract with the Oilers last week. The contract 
includes several lucrative incentive bonuses and is expected to match the 
previous year's $625,000 base salary and $25,000 signing bonus.

Nelson Mandela pledged before a joint meeting of Congress today that South 
Africa's future government would be a U.S.-style democracy but said that in the 
meantime his people have the right to use "the weapons of war" to defend their 
inalienable human rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We must contend still with the reality that South Africa is a country in the 
grip of the apartheid crime against humanity," said Mandela, the deputy 
president of the African National Congress who was released from prison Feb. 11 
after 27 years as a prisoner of the government he took up arms against. 
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to arrive at the point when we can say that South Africa is set on 
an irreversible course leading to its transformation into a united, democratic 
and non-racial country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people continue to die to this day, victims of armed agents of the state 
who are still determined to turn their guns against the very idea of a racial 
democracy," Mandela told a rapt audience of lawmakers, diplomats and Cabinet 
officers in the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela thanked Congress for the sanctions against the government of South 
Africa imposed after the lawmakers overrode President Ronald Reagan's veto in 
1986, and he repeated his call for direct economic aid to the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was greeted with prolonged applause as he made his way into the 
chamber. He beamed a wide smile as he mounted the podium and began a speech 
that was punctuated by applause. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking more help, Mandela presented his vision of the South Africa of the 
future -- a non-racial society with a democratic constitution, a bill of 
rights, an independent judiciary and a multi-party political system. 
</P>
<P>
While defending the right of government to intervene in the economy to help the 
poor, he said the ANC "holds no ideological positions which dictate that it 
must adopt a policy of nationalization" and promised that foreign businessmen 
could have confidence in the security of their investments. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela, who has drawn criticism from members of Congress for his support 
of violence as well as Cuba's Fidel Castro, Libya's Moammar Kadafi and the 
PLO's Yasser Arafat, said such a democratic society could not be built until 
violence by the white South African government ends. 
</P>
<P>
"(South Africa) thirsts for the situation where those who are entitled by law 
to carry arms, as the forces of national security and law and order, will not 
turn their weapons against the citizens simply because the citizens assert that 
equality, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are fundamental human rights 
which are not only inalienable but must, if necessary, be defended with the 
weapons of war," he said in a 35-minute speech. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela became the third former political prisoner to address a joint meeting 
of Congress in the last eight months, after Polish Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa on Nov. 15 and Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was only the third private citizen ever to address a joint meeting, 
with the others being Walesa and Marquis de Lafayette in 1824.

Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello is a "zebra" -- Brazilian parlance 
for something rare and improbable. 
</P>
<P>
In a country with a macho tradition in government power, she is a female 
super-minister. In a job previously thought to require maturity and experience, 
she is 36 years old and relatively unseasoned. And in command of a 
market-oriented economic policy, she is a former Communist. 
</P>
<P>
In three months on the job, Cardoso has worked hard and achieved much. When she 
took over as economy minister March 15, Brazilian inflation was the highest in 
the world, soaring at a rarefied rate somewhere over 80% a month. Cardoso's job 
was to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
She did -- at least temporarily. Now the challenge is to keep inflation under 
control while at the same time preventing Latin America's largest economy from 
sinking into a deep recession. It's a difficult balancing act, and as 
inflationary pressures build and Brazil's economy sags, her ultimate success is 
far from assured. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, she has already proven controversial. Some analysts say 
Cardoso's lack of administrative skill is seriously impairing the ministry's 
performance; others counter that she has grown surprisingly in the job, showing 
toughness and tenacity that may make up for other shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
What no one denies is that she is close to President Fernando Collor de Mello. 
</P>
<P>
The middle-class daughter of a Sao Paulo police inspector who died when she was 
23, Cardoso met Brazil's future president while working in the National 
Treasury in the mid-1980s. Her job was to negotiate with Brazilian state and 
municipal governments on their debts to the treasury. Collor was the governor 
of tiny Alagoas state, and, as an economist himself, a man who dealt personally 
with its debt problems. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, both she and Collor belonged to the centrist Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party, which had come to power after the armed forces ended 21 years 
of military dictatorship in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
(Cardoso had joined the Communist Party while a student, but her association 
with the party was short. "It lasted for as short a time as she dated the 
professor of general history in the course, who encouraged her Communist 
ideas," according to the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo.) 
</P>
<P>
Cardoso left the treasury in 1987 and created an economic consulting firm that 
helped Collor start his campaign for the presidency. Later, she joined Collor's 
new National Reconstruction Party and became his chief economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her leftist friends criticized Cardoso for joining Collor, 40, whose 
political background is conservative. "I lost some friends," she admitted, but 
the team of advisers she formed included economists of both the right and left. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the campaign, when Collor blasted his leftist opponent with a 
barrage of anti-Communist rhetoric, Cardoso threatened to quit, according to 
press reports. 
</P>
<P>
But she stayed, and after his election last December, she was put in charge of 
the new "super-ministry" of the economy that Collor created by combining 
Brazil's old Planning and Finance ministries. That made Cardoso, by all 
accounts, the most powerful woman official in Brazilian history. 
</P>
<P>
She is said to be one of the few people around the president who calls him 
Fernando. The close relationship gives her political clout that someone hired 
only for technical expertise would not enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
"Her strong point is that she is a political finance minister," said Richard 
Foster, editor of a political and economic intelligence service called Brazil 
Watch. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said the economy minister needs political support because parts of the 
anti-inflation program have been opposed by powerful sectors. Business people 
have been hurt by price freezes and a drastic cutback in money circulation; 
middle-class consumers have been squeezed by a freeze on savings accounts and 
deposits in financial markets; banks have lost big profits previously derived 
from inflated interest rates, and labor unions have been frustrated by the 
government's refusal to order new cost-of-living raises. 
</P>
<P>
Cardoso certainly has her critics. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not an effective communicator with the public at large," said a foreign 
bank executive in Brazil, who described the minister as "distant, removed, 
impatient." 
</P>
<P>
As long ago as the early 1980s, during her tenure as an assistant professor at 
the University of Sao Paulo's School of Economics, she was known as "cold and 
formal with those she didn't know well, but sweet and cheerful with her 
friends," according to O Estado de Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Franco, an economics professor at Rio's Catholic University, was among 
Brazilians surprised by Cardoso's ministerial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"Most economists were sort of expecting that the minister of economy would be 
handled by a first-rate economist," Franco recalled. "Zelia certainly was not 
regarded as one of the major economists in the country. Far from it." 
</P>
<P>
She chose a competent second echelon of economists to work with her, Franco 
said, but the problem is that Cardoso and a small circle of her closest 
collaborators make major decisions "in a bunker style," without consulting 
outside experts or lower levels within the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some of the ministry's measures have contained legal and technical 
flaws that have threatened to undermine the credibility of the whole 
anti-inflation program. For example, two measures that set prison terms for 
"economic crimes" were unconstitutional; they had to be withdrawn and 
rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
Several similar errors led O Estado de Sao Paulo to conclude that the 
government had completed "two months of juridical bumbling." Such criticism fed 
widespread fears that the stabilization program was in danger of falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
Cardoso's style also has created morale problems within the ministry, according 
to economist Franco. Many skilled employees who are not called upon for 
contributions worry that they will lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression one gets from visiting the ministry is that 50 people are 
working all night long and the rest, 1,500, are doing nothing, just trying to 
figure out how not to get fired," Franco said. "Something is missing in the 
capacity to organize this big machine." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Langoni, another non-government economist, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"One problem of this group is that they are a very small group and very closed 
in terms of debating future measures," Langoni said. But he said Cardoso 
recently has begun consulting more with experts outside the closed circle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's slowly beginning to open up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil Watch editor Foster said Cardoso may have been outmaneuvered by Sao 
Paulo industrialists who quickly criticized her austerity methods as 
threatening mass layoffs. "Zelia got frightened" and allowed a substantial 
increase in the money supply, possibly adding to inflationary pressures, Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the business community exaggerated to try and get Zelia nervous and 
get her to do what she did, to loosen up a bit," he said. "She was outsmarted 
because she didn't have enough experience." 
</P>
<P>
As inflation has crept back up to monthly rates of 3% in April and at least 5% 
in May, Cardoso has taken a tougher line. Early in June she warned that 
inflation would be controlled even at the cost of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is called inflation. That is concern No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the 
government," she said recently. 
</P>
<P>
She also has talked tough with private banks that hold most of Brazil's $115 
billion foreign debt, the largest in the Third World. Meeting with major 
bankers in New York in late May, she emphasized that Brazil has no intention of 
making payments on $5.5 billion in overdue interest until the debt is 
renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking her current job, Cardoso, who has never been married, would 
sometimes cook dinner for a small circle of friends in her one-bedroom Sao 
Paulo apartment. She enjoyed tennis. She reportedly spent much of her income on 
elegant dresses and suits from fashionable boutiques and meals in good 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But since moving to a government flat in Brasilia and to her super-ministry, 
there has been little time for social life. "I leave here at midnight, every 
night," she told a recent visitor to her office. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview last month she said she was in love, but "it is a 
platonic love. I don't have time for dating because of my work." 
</P>
<P>
The signs of strain and fatigue can often be seen on her face. What keeps her 
going? "I believe we are building a new country," she told a Brazilian 
newspaper. 
</P>
