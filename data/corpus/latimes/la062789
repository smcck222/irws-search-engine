A hearing is scheduled July 14 in Kern County Superior Court in Bakersfield to 
determine if the United Farm Workers union should be permanently restrained 
from using a photograph of a boy born without arms and legs to promote its 
table grape boycott. Last week, Judge Roger Randall issued a temporary 
restraining order against the union's use of the picture of 8-year-old Felipe 
Franco of Delano. The boy's parents sued the union for invasion of privacy 
after it used the picture as an example of the effects of pesticides. UFW 
attorneys contended that the Francos signed a release form. UFW leader Cesar 
Chavez began the grape boycott in 1984, contending that the use of pesticides 
posed a threat to vineyard workers and consumers. Grape industry officials have 
denied the union's charges.

Ambulance workers at two Sacramento companies have agreed not to walk off their 
jobs until at least midnight tonight in hopes that county officials will 
intervene. Jim Phillou, a field representative for the Hospital and Health Care 
Workers Union Local 250, said the emergency medical technicians and paramedics 
voted "nearly unanimously" to extend the strike deadline. The workers rejected 
contract offers from Metropolitan Ambulance Co. and Sacramento Ambulance Co., 
but negotiations were still under way.

ONCE-UGLY SILVER STRAND TAKES ON RICH LUSTER OF PLATINUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Development in the Silver Strand area just west of Marina del Rey is less than 
10 years old, but already the neighborhood may have outlived its name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a misnomer," said Mary Legg, a real estate broker and a pioneer in the 
development of the Strand. "They should have called it the Platinum Strand." 
</P>
<P>
In less than a decade, the Strand -- a sliver of land two blocks wide and 10 
blocks long wedged between Venice and Marina del Rey -- has been quietly 
transformed from an ugly, scarred and pitted oil field into an architecturally 
eclectic mix of multilevel, million-dollar single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The area looks like a movie set," said Santa Monica architect Marshall Lewis, 
who has designed five houses on the Silver Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the combination of big houses of many styles crammed together on small 
lots gives the area a slightly unreal, movie-backdrop appearance. The 
impression is enhanced by the serene Ballona Lagoon -- home to a surprising 
variety of shore birds -- which many of the homes face. 
</P>
<P>
Homes in the interior of the Strand are separated by landscaped malls. One of 
the remaining footbridges built by Abbot Kinney, the father of Venice, crosses 
the waterway to connect the Strand with the Venice community and beach. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the traffic and noise of adjacent Marina del Rey's restaurants and 
crowded apartment complexes, the area remains a hideaway. Most days on the 
Strand are free of either vehicular or pedestrian traffic. 
</P>
<P>
It is that insulation, with proximity to urban Los Angeles, that has made the 
area attractive to working professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Epstein, a Strand homeowner and a broker with Darrell Lee &amp; 
Associates in Marina del Rey, said the Strand could become even more desirable 
than Malibu for working professionals because it offers a waterfront location 
and is closer to downtown Los Angeles, to freeways and to Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last area other than Malibu in which you can have a large 
single-family home and still walk to the beach," he said. "Yet it's closer to 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The demand for housing has led to skyrocketing prices for land and homes. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the 35-by-90-foot lots were worth about $20,000, but today 
those lots are valued closer to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Darrell Lee, who has sold 50 to 60 lots since 1981, said the 
amount of appreciation has surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal forecast was that lots would only go up to $250,000," he said. 
"Now I wish I had kept some (land)." 
</P>
<P>
Homes, many featuring atriums and rooftop decks, start at $1 million. Epstein 
said 3,000- to 5,000-square-foot homes have been appreciating by about $200,000 
to $250,000 a year in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I predict that by next year we could be hitting the $2-million mark for 
homes," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Although development started in the early 1980s, the Silver Strand got its name 
and was subdivided in 1906 by Kinney, who built the Venice canals, which feed 
into the Ballona Lagoon. But it remained a subdivision on paper, and 
development became even less of a priority when oil was discovered in the area 
in 1930. For nearly 40 years, the Strand was a forest of oil pumps and wells. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1960s, dwindling oil field production combined with development of 
Marina del Rey in the adjacent county-owned wetlands revived interest in the 
Silver Strand. Because Los Angeles County retained ownership of all the land in 
Marina del Rey, developers with long-term leases concentrated on building a 
rentals-only community there. 
</P>
<P>
But the Strand was located in the city of Los Angeles and privately owned, 
allowing for the development of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, voters created the state Coastal Commission to oversee development 
near the beach. Heightened awareness about the environment meant a growing 
resistance to development. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never about the environment," Legg said recently as she sat in a 
trailer outside three homes she and her son, Dan, are building on Via Dolce. 
"They thought they were trying to stop a bunch of rich people looking to build 
an exclusive community near the beach. But we were just a bunch of regular 
people who happened to own those lots." 
</P>
<P>
After a five-year fight, building permits were issued. The city of Los Angeles, 
however, said it would be several years before it could build streets, sewers 
and lights for the area. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, about 150 property owners banded together to raise $4.5 million to 
build the infrastructure themselves. The first homes were built in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers say the Silver Strand remains something of a secret because 
it was developed by several individual property owners without any major 
marketing.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hibari Misora, 52, a singer who symbolized Japan's postwar recovery to millions 
of Japanese. She was considered a source of strength for many Japanese after 
Japan's defeat in World War II, Masao Yamaguchi, a professor at Tokyo Foreign 
Language University, told Kyodo News Service. Miss Misora, a Yokohama 
fishmonger's daughter, made her singing debut at age 11 in 1948. She was later 
celebrated for her renditions of melancholy ballads such as "Kanashii Sake" 
(Sad Rice Wine) and "Ringo Oiwake" (Song of Apples). She first performed in the 
United States when she was 13. In 1973 she attracted 8,000 fans to the Forum in 
Inglewood for a concert where she was praised for the wide range and quality of 
her voice. She ended her 40-year career with a 10-hour live radio show by 
Nippon Broadcasting Co. on March 21, shortly before she was hospitalized with 
respiratory problems. Miss Misora sold 68 million records, including 45 million 
singles. In Tokyo on Saturday of the complications of pneumonia.

MICHEL AFLAQ; FOUNDER OF IRAQ'S RULING PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Michel Aflaq, 79, the founder and leader of Iraq's ruling Baath party. With the 
late Salah Bitar, Aflaq founded the party in 1947 as a secular party advocating 
Arab unity and non-communist socialism. Aflaq was in and out of jail in the 
early 1950s as the party struggled for influence in Syria. It took control 
there in 1963 in a bloody coup. Factional fighting forced Aflaq to go 
underground in 1966 and flee to Syria. However, the party seized power the same 
year in Iraq, and Aflaq was appointed secretary general. He worked out of 
Beirut but moved to Baghdad after civil war in Lebanon broke out in 1975. The 
Iraqi Baath party is now a bitter rival of the Syrian party. In Paris on Friday

OPERATION FLIGHT BACK SCORES ITS FIRST VICTORY AS WITNESS RETURNS TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though police had caught the thief who last month stole Leroy Johnson's 
credit card, chances were the case would have been dismissed unless the 
Washington state man could return to testify. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said Monday he was not sure whether the Washington Department of 
Natural Resources, which issued him the card, would have paid the plane or 
hotel fare necessary for him to return. The San Diego district attorney's 
office probably would not have paid Johnson's expenses, either, because the 
crime was considered too small. 
</P>
<P>
So, the man who stole the card while Johnson was in San Diego on business would 
likely have gone free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Lauding Program's Success 
</P>
<P>
Until recently. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Police Department program, dubbed Operation Flight Back, enabled 
Johnson to testify at the Vista trial Monday of the man accused of stealing the 
credit card. Officials were lauding the program's success after Vincent Ray 
Garcia, 24, of Fallbrook pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulent use of a 
credit card, one count of car theft and one count of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, I think justice has been served," said Johnson, a training and 
equipment specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The case was the first to go to trial since the novel program's start in 
December. Authorities say the program fills a void in the legal system that 
criminals have exploited: In the past, prosecutors would often not pay to bring 
back out-of-towners to testify for small crimes and it was rare for anyone 
living faraway to pay their own way back. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the cooperation of several major airlines, hotels and car-rental 
agencies, it will be possible to bring tourists back to testify in such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"The neat thing is there's no cost to taxpayers," said police spokesman Matthew 
Weathersby. "Everybody's got a vested interest. The rental-car places don't 
want their cars ripped off, the hotels and airlines don't want people to go 
away with a negative image. From a Police Department standpoint, we get to lock 
bad guys up." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brock Arstill said the case against Garcia would have failed 
without Johnson's testimony and that of another out-of-towner, Robert Schurtz 
of Texas. Schurtz, a manager at a Houston car dealership, testified that Garcia 
had stolen a car from his Texas car lot on Feb. 21, Arstill said. Garcia was 
arrested June 10 in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Both Johnson and Schurtz were flown in and put up at a local hotel; the hotel 
and airline paid the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked out well," Arstill said. "We had everybody here. Even though it's a 
crime that 
</P>
<P>
doesn't involve a lot of money, we're still going to prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
The industries involved in the program have a one-year commitment. "At the end 
of the year, we'll show them what we've done and ask them to renew it," 
Weathersby said. It has so far proved attractive to the businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind, if you go anyplace and have a bad experience, you're going to 
have a negative image of that town," Weathersby said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the airlines include Air Canada, Korean Air, Northwest Airlines, 
Southwest Airlines, Japan Air Lines and Mexicana. Weathersby said witnesses 
could be flown back to San Diego "from anywhere in the free world." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the countywide program originated with officer Joe Navarro, who 
works the city's southern division. Navarro took note of the large number of 
thefts of tourists occurring near the Mexican border, and also of the casual 
attitude of the criminals they apprehended, who knew their cases would not be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
The program was modeled after similar operations at the Honolulu and Los 
Angeles international airports.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 11, DIES OF GUNSHOT WOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-year-old South El Monte boy died after he was accidently shot Friday 
afternoon while playing with a rifle at a friend's home, coroners officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Salvador Ortiz, died Saturday at Greater El Monte Community Hospital 
after receiving a single bullet wound to the head, said Claude Boucher, the 
coroner's supervising investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz and a 14-year-old friend, whose name was not released because of his age, 
came across a .22-caliber rifle that they did not realize was loaded, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old boy began handling the gun and when he pulled the trigger, the 
gun fired once, striking Ortiz in the head, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the 14-year-old nor two other boys playing in the house were hurt, 
deputies said. Sheriff's homicide detectives declared it an accidental 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they did not know whether either parent was home at the time.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER INJURED AT MOBIL REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A contract employee erecting scaffolding at the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance 
was hospitalized for four hours Friday after suffering a minor facial burn from 
a small leak of water containing hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin R. Chaves, 35, of Santa Ana was taken by paramedics to Little Company 
of Mary Hospital, where he was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Fire Department Inspector Doug Bergen said Chaves was hit in the face 
by a drop of acid leaking from a flange. He said Chaves was wearing protective 
clothing but that he had his facial shield raised when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's environmental manager, Greg Munakata, said Chaves was constructing the 
scaffolding so that workers could repair the leaking flange in the refinery's 
alkylation unit. 
</P>
<P>
The slow leak, discovered early Friday morning, occurred in a relief gas 
scrubber that removes hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
An initiative campaign has been launched in Torrance to force Mobil to stop 
using the acutely toxic chemical.

The discovery in San Diego County this year of several gypsy moths, 
tree-destroying pests with voracious appetites, has prompted agriculture 
officials to increase trapping and surveillance of the insect and consider 
spraying pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
About six male gypsy moths have been found in San Diego County in 1989. One 
insect was trapped in Valley Center, near the intersection of Cole Grade Road 
and Valley Center Road. Five others, including one trapped last weekend, have 
been caught in La Mesa, near the intersection of Spring Street and California 
94. 
</P>
<P>
The pest, which can eat up to a square foot of leaves daily, was eradicated 
from the Mission Valley area in 1985, after trappings of hundreds of the 
insects throughout California in the early 1980s led to statewide pesticide 
spraying, said Kathleen Thuner, county agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding one sort of marshals your forces. But when you get more than one in an 
area, that signifies that there may be potential infestation," Thuner said. "We 
still don't know if spraying will be needed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitoring Traps 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials have increased trapping in La Mesa and Valley Center, and 
are monitoring traps daily in Spring Valley, Ocean Beach and Del Mar, where 
three moths were found last year. Officials are searching primarily for gypsy 
egg masses, which can hold as many as 1,000 eggs, Thuner said. 
</P>
<P>
If the small, tan, hair-covered eggs of the moth are found, officials may 
consider spraying bacillus thuringiensis, an organic pesticide that kills the 
larvae, next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Found mostly in northeastern states, gypsy moths during their caterpillar stage 
feed on more than 300 varieties of plants and shrubs. They can also defoliate 
and destroy many types of trees, including avocado, lemon, pine and evergreen 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"The moth has an appetite for just about anything with a leaf on it," Thuner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The adult male gypsy moth has feathery antennas with dark wings and a 1 
1/2-inch wingspan, she said. The female insects are white, with a wingspan of 
about 2 inches.

The man considered the spiritual leader of Shiite Muslims in Europe said Monday 
he wants to run for president of Iran but is being refused a valid passport to 
return to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani said he wrote a letter June 10 to Interior Minister 
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi to inform him of his bid for the presidency. He said that 
on Friday, he was instructed to go the Iranian Embassy to fill out the proper 
forms, but on Monday he was told he could not get his passport validated. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani is the only official candidate in the 
July 28 election. Wednesday is the last day to file as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Rouhani, 53, has spent 25 years in Europe and is a resident of France. He said 
he has been unable to get his Iranian passport validated for four or five 
years.

U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official party line given by the Chinese authority for the brutal crackdown 
on the democracy movement has been the necessity to restore social stability so 
that economic reform and business ties with the outside world can continue. 
Deng Xiaoping obviously believes that he can cut off Western reporters, kill 
and imprison Chinese who believe in Western democratic values, and at the same 
time, attract Western businessmen and tourists to spend money in China. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to order the murderous assault on the students, Deng must have 
figured that his old friend President Bush would put American business 
interests ahead of American principles, and business with the United States 
would remain as usual. The reluctance of the Bush Administration to go any 
further than symbolic gestures and halting minor military sales might have been 
the confirmation Deng was waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
To continue trade with China would strengthen the hands of the progressive wing 
in China, some Administration officials argued. But for the past 10 years, 
trade with China did strengthen the hand of Deng Xiaoping, whom we thought to 
be the most progressive leader in China, and we saw how he used that strength 
against the people. Further sanctions would only hurt the Chinese people, 
President Bush insisted. But without serious threat to his economic program, 
Deng has nothing to worry about in his relentless effort to suppress the 
Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
In this time of turmoil, it is certainly prudent to keep all diplomatic 
channels open, but we must also call into question the economic policies that 
benefit the unpopular rulers in China. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, we witnessed the efforts of the Jewish community to focus our 
government's attention on the plight of Soviet Jews and the economic pressure 
by the U.S. did help change the Soviet treatment of Jews. The black community 
is doing the same for the blacks in South Africa. As the outcry from 
Chinese-Americans can be heard across the country, can we expect some 
sympathetic consideration from Washington?

U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA

<P>
I find it difficult to describe the disgust I feel towards President Bush and 
Marlin Fitzwater, White House Press Secretary, after reading "Bush Acts to Ease 
Sino-U.S. Tension" (Part I, June 17). 
</P>
<P>
These two typical politicians want to salvage this relationship because of 
"America's once-flourishing commercial relationship with China." So what if the 
Chinese leadership has no qualms about ordering the wanton slaughter of its 
citizens; the U.S. feels it is more important to overlook these atrocities for 
the almighty buck! Part of this commercial endeavor was sending arms to the 
Chinese. Were these the arms used to put down the pro-democracy revolt? 
Fitzwater even admits that the U.S. government works with the leaders in charge 
at the time. Terrific! 
</P>
<P>
I guess it is no secret that the U.S. government will gladly deal with 
international criminals, whether they are running a country or not. What are a 
few thousand Chinese lives worth, anyway, when there is a buck to be made.

<P>
There's one thing we can do, other than just wring our hands over the China 
holocaust, still in process. We can protect the students here. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are being photographed, spied upon, tracked down and threatened by 
undercover operatives of the ruling murderous junta. Retaliation is threatened 
when these students return to China, and/or immediately against their families 
now in China. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese students and the Chinese-American community know these 
infiltrators, and they can be apprehended and deported. The attempt to bring 
the China wars into this country can be stopped at the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Our laws are clear on the matter: The Chinese students (as well as all aliens) 
enjoy the full protection of the U.S. Constitution while here. International 
law is clear on the matter: Representatives of a foreign government have no 
right to carry out acts of political repression in another country. 
</P>
<P>
The slaughter of Beijing students was an expensive act. Expensive to China, 
since it is consuming its bright children and since it has repudiated the 
international cooperation that made the China miracle. And expensive to the 
rest of us, since debts to the new China must now be written off, exploratory 
plans torn up, and a new and fretful economic frontier established. 
</P>
<P>
But better we should accept these minor inconveniences. Better nearly anything 
but that China slip into the national psychosis that impelled Germany to 
challenge the world 50 years ago. True, the unfolding drama as yet lacks a 
credible Hitler among the ruling Chinese hard-liners. But we do have in George 
Bush, ably seconded by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a credible 
Neville Chamberlain for the necessary appeaser role. American outrage 
transmitted through this mouthpiece becomes a squeak.

EYESORE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driving south from Santa Barbara recently, my husband and I happened by Zuma 
Beach, and there I was confronted by an eyesore that broke my heart. 
</P>
<P>
The beach was almost deserted -- yet the bright orange and white trash cans 
that proliferated (one almost every 20 feet) were enough to blight the 
landscape and make me want to cry. 
</P>
<P>
Were a private developer to permit such an atrocity, he would be skewered by 
the public, but the "public" beach is scenically and environmentally destroyed 
by this outrageous condition. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly our taxes, bond issues, etc. should pay for trash cans that are not 
so aesthetically out of line!

GIAMATTI SHOULD CALL IN THE 'BULLPEN' TO JUDGE ROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ, Alan M. Dershowitz teaches at Harvard Law School and 
writes a syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose will probably strike out in his attempt to get the federal courts to 
prevent baseball's Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti from deciding his fate. 
But "Charlie Hustle" does have a point in arguing that Giamatti may have 
compromised his objectivity when he wrote a letter to a federal judge in 
Cincinnati, commenting on Ronald Peters' cooperation with the baseball 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, a convicted drug trafficker, was facing a stiff sentence. Giamatti 
wrote to the sentencing judge, advising him of Peters' cooperation, calling it 
"significant and truthful." The obvious purpose of the letter was to reward 
Peters for his help in the baseball investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In publicly declaring Peters' damning testimony against Rose to be "truthful" 
-- without having heard from Rose himself -- Giamatti appears to have prejudged 
the credibility of a major witness. This is simply unfair. Rose has essentially 
called Peters a liar, and Rose's lawyers have alleged that the "betting slips" 
Peters has provided to the media -- and presumably to the commissioner -- were 
altered. Since Peters sought to trade his information for favorable treatment, 
there is good reason to approach its veracity with several shakers full of 
salt. It may well be believable -- especially if it is corroborated by 
objective evidence -- but it certainly cannot be believed simply because Peters 
says it is true. 
</P>
<P>
If Giamatti is the judge and jury in the Rose case -- as he claims he is -- 
then he should not be making public (or even private) assessments of the 
credibility of a crucial witness, before that witness has been subjected to the 
truth-testing process of confrontation and cross-examination. Would Giamatti 
really be open to the possibility of now disbelieving Peters? If so, would he 
have to write a correcting letter to the judge? 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti is not bound, of course, by the provisions of the Bill of Rights, or 
even by the common-law system of determining truth. Baseball is a law unto 
itself. It has a unique status as our national pastime, a status recognized by 
its exemption from antitrust laws that are applicable to other big-time sports. 
But the public has the right to expect that major league baseball will be fair. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing inherently wrong with the commissioner of baseball expressing 
his opinion on the value of a witness' cooperation. Nor is there anything wrong 
with him writing to a sentencing judge on behalf of a convicted defendant 
awaiting sentence, even if that letter was part of a deal for that defendant's 
cooperation with his investigation. Prosecutors do that all the time. 
</P>
<P>
And that is the crux of the issue. Giamatti seems to be acting more like a 
prosecutor -- a careful and fair one, to be sure -- than like a judge. The 
investigation appears similar to grand jury inquiries being conducted by an 
earnest prosecutor determined to learn the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But under the American system of justice, a grand jury only indicts; it does 
not convict. An independent judiciary, not involved in the investigation, 
passes the ultimate judgment of guilt or innocence only after hearing both 
sides. This "adversary system of justice" is widely regarded as the best 
protection against bias, both conscious and unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Giamatti eventually wins or loses the federal court suit filed against 
him by Rose -- and I predict he will win -- he should take Rose's charges of 
prejudgment seriously. In a high-profile case like this one, it is important 
that justice not only be done, but also appear to be done. Of course, Giamatti 
must believe that he can still be fair. And he may even be right. But Pete Rose 
fans will never be satisfied if the commissioner relies on Peters' testimony 
after having publicly prejudged his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti should proceed with his investigation. If, after hearing Rose's side 
of the story, he concludes that Rose is guilty of betting, then he should issue 
his report as an "indictment." That indictment should then be presented to a 
completely neutral panel of distinguished arbitrators who had nothing to do 
with the investigation. That panel, which could include such luminaries as 
retired Supreme Court Justices Arthur A. Goldberg Jr. and Lewis Powell and 
others of similar unimpeachable integrity, would make the ultimate decision. 
They would hear both sides of the case, make credibility determinations about 
the witnesses and render their decision of guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Under that approach, everything Giamatti has done up to now would be perfectly 
acceptable. He would be a strong advocate for the integrity of baseball. But in 
America, it is regarded as unfair to be both investigator and judge. If and 
when Bart Giamatti releases his indictment of Pete Rose, he should be taken out 
for a relief pitcher.

EXEC PAY SHOULDN'T BE HOSTAGE TO CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK E. BUCHMAN, Mark E. Buchman, a merchant banker in Century City, was 
president of the Government National Mortgage Assn. (Ginnie Mae) during the 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The February brouhaha over the pay bill is now history. The current 
bloodletting in the House may have run its course with Jim Wright and Tony 
Coelho. The good work done by the Commission on Executive, Legislative and 
Judicial Salaries has gone for naught, mainly because its recommendation was so 
misunderstood by the public -- and Congress wouldn't face up to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
We now see many examples in the Bush Administration where qualified candidates 
will not take or can not keep appointments and where existing officials are 
leaving prematurely to escape onerous employment conditions. Just last week, H. 
Robert Heller, a Federal Reserve governor, announced that he would resign, 
saying he would have been able to stay had Congress approved a pay raise for 
top government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Pay, of course, is not the entire problem or answer. Many non-financial factors 
are involved: challenge, sense of duty and service, the excitement and 
tremendous satisfaction of participating in a policy position in government, 
the knowledge and contacts gained -- these are but a few of the rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Unless we want top federal officials coming just from the wealthier classes of 
our society, we'd better face up to some real problems. Correcting the salary 
scale for senior executive service would be an excellent starter. Right now a 
huge financial sacrifice is involved in going to Washington, one of America's 
most costly places to live. I know because I've done it. A respectable salary 
level should be determined, one that at least doesn't involve outright 
financial losses. There probably always will be, and maybe should be, a 
differential between public and private pay scales, due to the other beneficial 
factors already mentioned. But the gross discrepancies existing at present only 
exacerbate ethical and other temptations. 
</P>
<P>
A key element to the solution is to break the lock Congress has over the salary 
structure of the two other parts of government, the executive and the 
judiciary. Let Congress muck around with its own salary structure and be 
answerable to the electorate. But it is scandalous to hold others hostage to 
the politics of Congress' grandstanding before the voters. Congressmen should 
be well paid and not be permitted to accept any outside income (just as 
executive branch officials are not now permitted to receive any outside direct 
income). 
</P>
<P>
There are many other considerable impediments to government service: the 
voluminous forms to fill out, requiring days of work; the confirmation process 
itself, often drawn out and demeaning to the nominee and his or her family; 
restrictions on post-government employment (not applicable to members of 
Congress, even though they make the rules); virtually total public disclosure 
of one's financial situation and loss of much of the privacy we normally enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
It is said you get what you pay for. In most cases inour society, the men and 
women best suited to run our government are largely turned off by the many 
disincentives of coming to Washington. Let's at least address the pay problem 
with our eyes open and false rhetoric contained. 
</P>
<P>
Would Mr. Smith go to Washington now?

ROCKWELL LICENSE BID DRAWS FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING URGED ON 'HOT LAB' RENEWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility said Monday it 
will contest Rockwell International's bid to renew its operating license for a 
nuclear fuel recycling facility at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is concerned about the risk of conducting nuclear activities 
near populated areas and about Rockwell's record at a nuclear weapons plant 
near Denver, said Dr. Richard Saxon, an orthopedic surgeon in Encino and board 
member of the Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-nuclear group, which has a membership of about 2,300 doctors, dentists 
and other health professionals in Los Angeles, will ask the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission to hold hearings before ruling on the license renewal, Saxon said. 
Such hearings are discretionary under NRC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is seeking a 10-year license to operate the facility, known as the 
"Hot Lab." From the early 1960s until 1986, the lab was used to remove 
plutonium and other materials from nuclear fuel rods and package them for 
future use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
License Extended 
</P>
<P>
The firm's license, which expires June 30, has been extended indefinitely while 
the agency assesses the environmental impact of the facility west of 
Chatsworth, NRC spokesman Greg Cook said. Rockwell officials said no nuclear 
work is being done at the lab, which they said contains traces of radioactivity 
that pose no health threat. The lab is being decontaminated while the firm's 
Rocketdyne division seeks future contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocketdyne has and will continue to operate all business activities at Santa 
Susana Field Laboratory in a safe and responsible manner," said company 
spokesman Pat Coulter. "All reports, tests and surveys by the government and 
private groups have supported that fact." 
</P>
<P>
Coulter was referring to concerns growing from publicity about a U.S. 
Department of Energy report on low-level chemical and radioactive contamination 
at Santa Susana, where the company operated about 16 nuclear reactors between 
1947 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles members of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which has 
35,000 members nationwide, said the laboratory should be prohibited from doing 
further work with radioactive materials. The chapter will use about $3,000 
contributed last week by an anonymous donor to launch the campaign against 
renewal of the license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record Cited 
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the licensing on the basis of the fact that the area has a 
tremendous number of people," Saxon said. "We have great doubt that Rockwell is 
capable of doing things properly, given the company's record in Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell manages the Energy Department's Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant near 
Denver, which is the subject of a criminal inquiry by the FBI and U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency over alleged hazardous-waste violations. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the agency will probably take months to complete an environmental 
impact report on the Hot Lab. The report involves reviewing the lab's safety 
records. After the report is completed, there will be a 30-day public comment 
period during which individuals or groups may request a public hearing, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said "everybody and his brother at NRC" have received hundreds of letters 
from residents concerned about future nuclear operations at Santa Susana. But 
he said an administrative law judge appointed by the agency would not grant a 
hearing on the Hot Lab unless residents had a "germane and reasonably specific 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't renew or not renew based on public opinion; we do it based on safety 
records and on the impact on the environment," Cook said. "Our experience with 
this licensee has been good." 
</P>
<P>
But Saxon said the potential risk of an accident at the lab outweighs all other 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1959, Rockwell has had NRC licenses to operate six other nuclear 
facilities at its Santa Susana and Canoga Park plants, Cook said.

OFFICIAL CITES TRAFFIC, EFFECT ON NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
CLUB PLANNED NEAR CSUN FAILS TO WIN PERMIT

An application for a youth dance club near Cal State Northridge was turned down 
by a zoning officer Monday after the proposal ran into a barrage of criticism 
from university officials, police and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Mark A. Steele, a 25-year-old concert promoter who had filed the application, 
said he probably would appeal the ruling but admitted that he "didn't expect 
this much opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Steele is proposing a dance club to be called Whiplash, which would accommodate 
up to 550 patrons age 18 and older, in the former Bullwinkle's restaurant on 
Reseda Boulevard, one block west of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
He said that only those who are 21 and older would be given wristbands 
permitting them to buy alcoholic drinks and that 10 off-duty police officers 
would patrol inside the club to make certain that 18- to 20-year-olds did not 
obtain liquor through friends who were of legal age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Cited 
</P>
<P>
Jack C. Sedwick, a Los Angeles city associate zoning administrator, rejected 
Steele's request for a conditional-use permit to open the club, saying that it 
would be "detrimental to the neighborhood" and that patrons would "interfere 
with traffic circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Diana R. Gruendler, university housing services director, said that the club 
would encourage excessive drinking by students and that after its 2 a.m. 
closing, non-students would drift onto campus because "many young people have 
the mistaken notion that universities are a place where there are 24-hour 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
She also said the club would harm the university's reputation in the community 
because people would associate it with trouble caused by patrons, regardless of 
whether the disturbances were caused by students. 
</P>
<P>
The application also was opposed by Los Angeles Police Sgt. Frank Reynoso, who 
heads the Devonshire Division vice unit. 
</P>
<P>
Other clubs open to 18-year-olds "never succeed in keeping liquor from the 
underage group," he said. "In the dark, there is nothing to stop them from 
sipping someone else's drink." 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso also said other youth dance clubs are magnets for gangs, "which mix 
with one another, resulting in troubles in the parking lot, problems in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso said that in the last 30 months, there have been 25 accidents on Reseda 
Boulevard in front of the proposed club and that the club would aggravate the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Aragon, one of several longtime area residents who argued against the 
application, said it would harm "what has been a quiet university 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
But another said residents "already go through hell" because of disturbances in 
parking lots of restaurants in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Steele countered that clubs patronized by gangs "project a kind of image and 
play a certain kind of music to attract gang members. That is not the kind of 
club I want to operate." 
</P>
<P>
He also argued that he "should be given an opportunity to open up, to show what 
kind of operation I will run."

LIBEL SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
ACLU BACKS LEADERS OF RECALL DRIVE 
</P>

<P>
Charging that an Agoura Hills City Council member's libel suit is an attack on 
free speech, the American Civil Liberties Union said Monday it will defend two 
leaders of a failed recall drive against the $1.1-million action. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Louise C. Rishoff, an attorney, filed the suit against David 
Chagall and Carole Dynda in January during the heated recall effort, which fell 
short in May of the number of petition signatures needed to force a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Chagall and Dynda sponsored the recall petitions, which Rishoff said falsely 
accused her of conspiring to violate the Brown Act, a state law requiring that 
public business be done in the open. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly what happened here is citizens followed the recall process set out in 
the Agoura Hills charter and, as a result, they found themselves the subjects 
of a suit," said Robin S. Toma, an ACLU staff attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Toma said the suit and others like it elsewhere in the country have a chilling 
effect on criticism of public officials and on forms of participatory democracy 
such as recall campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Targeted 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Hills recall campaign targeted Rishoff, along with Councilwoman Fran 
Pavley, Mayor Darlene McBane and Mayor Pro Tem Vicky Leary, saying among other 
things that the four allowed city traffic problems to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Chagall and Dynda have been two of the more vocal critics of the council in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
But after the lawsuit was filed, Chagall and Dynda, the wife of former 
Councilman Ernest Dynda, tried to take a back seat in the recall effort. 
Neither would provide specifics of their petitions' charges that Rishoff 
conspired to violate the Brown Act, saying their lawyers advised them to 
refrain from comment. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was that it stifled my First Amendment rights," Chagall said of the 
suit. "It was intended precisely to affect the recall, to affect criticism, to 
deflect it." 
</P>
<P>
Rishoff could not be reached for comment Monday. But she said at the time she 
filed the suit that she was defamed by the accusatory petitions. She insisted 
that she did not violate the Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to hand over my reputation to these people to destroy," Rishoff 
told reporters at a press conference she held to announce the filing of the 
suit.

PADRES EMPLOY DAY OFF TO GO BACK TO THE BASICS

The Padres hit the cutoff man Monday. They fielded bunts, they made some pretty 
good relay throws from the outfield and they threw to the correct bases. 
</P>
<P>
But there wasn't a game Monday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, just a 
mini-version of spring training as Manager Jack McKeon ran his squad through 
its first workout since the beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It also was a time to work out frustrations that have been building through a 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not punishment," McKeon said. "We've got to correct some problems. There 
has been a lack of execution, so let's work on it. I don't like these off-day 
workouts, either, but when you win, it makes things easier." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also made some moves off the field Monday. They activated infielder 
Tim Flannery, who was on the 15-day disabled list with a partially torn muscle 
in his right forearm. To make room, they optioned infielder Gary Green to Las 
Vegas. They also sent pitcher Dave Leiper to Las Vegas for a 20-day 
rehabilitation assignment. Leiper had been on the disabled list with a sore 
left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this season Green has been sent to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things," he said. "It's a numbers game, and I just happen to 
be caught up in it." 
</P>
<P>
Leiper, who pitched batting practice at Monday's mandatory workout, also was 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"The arm feels great," he said. "The best it's felt all year. They just want me 
to get in some work, see some hitters. I haven't pitched well this year, but I 
went out there when I shouldn't a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone but pitcher Eric Show was on the field Monday. Show was in the 
trainer's room undergoing treatment for a sore back. He started Sunday's game 
against the Giants but left after three innings, allowing five runs and seven 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
"We had him checked out and he's fine," McKeon said. "I noticed in the third 
inning (of Sunday's game) he wasn't following through like he was earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres won Sunday, 10-7, to avoid a three-game sweep by the first-place 
Giants. Blown leads on Friday and Saturday, though, took their toll. McKeon 
held his first postgame, closed-door meeting after a 3-1 loss Saturday to vent 
his anger. Sunday afternoon on McKeon's desk sat a book: "Three Steps Forward, 
Two Steps Back: Persevering Through Pressure." 
</P>
<P>
"We're 10 games out because we put ourselves 10 games out," McKeon said. "I'd 
say with the way the league has gone so far, we ought to be five games out at 
the most." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Monday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get the guys focused," McKeon said. "What are we here to do? 
How can we prepare ourselves to win? If that means extra workouts, fine. Extra 
meetings, fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should you have to scream and holler at guys who are getting paid to do a 
job? You would think there would be personal embarrassment if they're not doing 
their job. The players are on stage; they're being judged. If a player doesn't 
care, maybe he's not the player I want. I saw a big difference (Sunday). Maybe 
it's time to get things going." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tony Gwynn: "I thought after the second half of last season, we knew what 
we needed to do. You can see what's happening, though. We're just not 
executing. When Jack said what he did (at Saturday's meeting), it was great. It 
opens your eyes and helps you bear down."

BELCHER PROVIDES RELIEF ONLY TO REDS, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the many apparent differences between starting pitching and late-inning 
relief pitching, Tim Belcher will be the first to tell you there is really only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Starters make a bad pitch and calmly call it a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
A late-inning reliever makes a bad pitch and calls it a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's all he can do to keep from screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a bad pitch to lose a game, that's all I got to say," Belcher barked 
behind a red face Monday night after allowing a two-run home run to the second 
batter he faced, previously homer-less Bo Diaz, which gave the Cincinnati Reds 
a 5-3 victory in front of 23,727 at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit the pitch at the wrong time, the wrong place, no excuses," Belcher 
said. "It was the pitch that cost us the game. I had plenty of time to warm up. 
I had plenty of time to do everything. I knew who the hitter was, I knew what 
the count was. My only excuse was ignorance. I'm human. I'm fallible." 
</P>
<P>
So many reasons for his anger, not the least of which was that the Dodgers blew 
a 3-0 lead and a chance to take three of four games from the Reds. Instead, 
despite 52 total hits in those games, they only split the series and wound up 
3-4 on the trip. It's not the best of circumstances in which they return to 
Dodger Stadium to begin a seven-game home stand tonight against the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher entered Monday's game at the start of the seventh inning. The score was 
3-3. Tim Leary, who began with five shutout innings, allowed a three-run homer 
to Paul O'Neill in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
What the Dodgers needed from the bullpen was a savior. Belcher, only two days 
removed from the news that he has been shipped out of the starting rotation and 
into a reliever role, was it. 
</P>
<P>
The first batter was Todd Benzinger, who had grounded out and flied out and 
basically played the game like the .248 hitter he was when it started. Belcher 
walked him. 
</P>
<P>
The next batter was Diaz, a part-time catcher who only had 19 hits this season. 
None of them were homers. In fact, he had not homered since last Aug. 16. So 
like any good .183 hitter, he tried to bunt. He failed, for strike one. Belcher 
worked the count on Diaz to 1-and-2. 
</P>
<P>
And then it was gone, with Diaz hitting a ball that disappeared over the 
left-center field fence, turning the Reds' dugout into a jumping maze of white 
and red. 
</P>
<P>
"I played this like a World Series game. I did not want to lose this game," 
said Red Manager Pete Rose, whose third-place team moved three games in front 
of the fourth-place Dodgers. "The atmosphere has not been real good around here 
lately. We've been playing spotty baseball. We needed this one." 
</P>
<P>
And Belcher certainly didn't need this one, considering his earlier move to the 
bullpen for the first time since last season did not exactly send him into 
cartwheels. 
</P>
<P>
He did well in his first relief appearance in Saturday's 10-3 victory, throwing 
three shutout innings for his first save. But even at that, he described his 
new role with, "Hey, it's a job" and expressed hope that he will soon return to 
the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on possible trades, that return from the bullpen is not unlikely. But 
for now, Belcher has taken his first hard step to getting used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of different aspects to starting and relieving," explained 
Leary, who has done both in the same season. "For one thing, there's the mental 
aspect -- as a starter, you know your routine, and when you are going to pitch, 
and you can get comfortable. As a reliever, you can never know. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there's the fact that as a reliever, you come in when the game is on the 
line. As a starter, you can lead off the inning by giving up a couple of hits 
and get out of a jam. As a reliever, you can't." 
</P>
<P>
That last part is what got Belcher Monday. Not that he can't get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much tougher it is if you get your mind to it," Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers promised that despite the loss, which dropped Belcher to 4-7, he 
will have plenty of opportunities to get his mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to find how he comes back from this tomorrow, or as soon as we can 
get him back in there," pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. "Something like 
this, you don't wait. You let him go right back after it." 
</P>
<P>
It's a bit odd to be focusing the story of a Dodger defeat on the team's 
league-best pitching, but that shows what the hitting has done lately, 
including Monday. The offense struck for 12 more hits, including Kirk Gibson's 
two-run homer in the first inning, his eighth, which broke a two-for-26 slump. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Dodgers could have finished off Red starter Rick Mahler in the 
fourth, when they put together three hits and a walk but could only get one 
run, on Jeff Hamilton's RBI single. The rally was squashed when, on a one-out 
infield single by Alfredo Griffin that apparently loaded the bases, Mike Davis 
overran third and was tagged out by shortstop Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
"That made the difference," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "We had them on 
the ropes, but we couldn't put them away." 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, at least Griffin had a hit on that play. The Dodger shortstop went 
four for four Monday night to finish the series at 10 for 16 and improve his 
average to .272 -- the highest it has been since coming to Los Angeles in a 
trade with the Oakland Athletics last season. This is the same man who on June 
11 was batting .201. In the last two weeks he has 23 hits in 50 at-bats, an 
average of .460. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers delayed one roster problem Monday by sending relief pitcher Ray 
Searage to triple-A Albuquerque on a 20-day rehabilitation. Searage, recovering 
from back spasms, will have no more than 20 days to pitch his way back into 
shape. The Dodgers solved the problem concerning the activation of John Tudor, 
who will make his 1989 debut tonight against San Diego at Dodger Stadium, by 
optioning Tim Crews to Albuquerque. Crews had made 26 relief appearances this 
season and was 0-0 with a 2.72 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Amid broadcast rumors that the Dodgers were close to a deal that would bring 
outfielder Kal Daniels from Cincinnati for pitcher Tim Leary, both clubs' 
general managers issued denials. Murray Cook of the Reds told reporters that 
although he has talked to Dodger Vice President Fred Claire, their talks were 
not serious. "There's nothing substantive there," Cook said. Meanwhile, Claire 
noted that, according to all rumors, his team has been close to trading for 
every slugger short of Babe Ruth. "I stated that I would like help offensively, 
and since then every man who swings a bat in the National League and American 
League has been mentioned," Claire said, adding that it had heartened him to 
see his team's 52 hits in the four-game series with the Reds. "I haven't shot 
down conversations, but I've been impressed with the way we've swung the bats 
in the last few days," Claire said. "Like I've said before, I think our 
offensive answer is right here."

the discount warehouse industry have so far feared to tread. 
</P>
<P>
When its new store opens in November, Salt Lake City-based Price Savers will 
become the first competing chain to challenge San Diego-based Price Co. on its 
home turf. The 100,000-square-foot store at California 78 and Emerald Drive, 
which will be Price Savers' 15th outlet, should do about $50 million in sales 
its first full year of business, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, other major discount warehouse chains, notably Costco Wholesale, 
PACE Membership and Sam's Wholesale Clubs, have conceded the San Diego County 
market to the four Price Clubs now open in San Diego, San Marcos, Santee and 
Chula Vista. Price, which has 42 Price Clubs in all, will open a fifth local 
location this summer in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Entrenched 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obvious appeal of the county's affluent and fast-growing 
population, competing wholesalers viewed Price as too strong and too entrenched 
to consider coming in, industry sources said. Price Co. founder Sol Price 
originated the discount warehouse concept in San Diego in 1976 and later guided 
the chain to its current position of industry leadership. 
</P>
<P>
An example of Price's predominance is that a typical Price Club location 
averages more than $110 million in annual sales, twice the average per-store 
sales of the best-performing competing chain. And Price is thought to be 
particularly strong in San Diego, and thus understandably protective of its 
turf, said Ward Lindenmayer, an independent stock analyst from San Francisco 
who follows the retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, there are easier fish to fry that wanting to go right into the 
home territory of the oldest and best-managed warehouse firm, particularly in 
San Diego, where Price has an established and well-known name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if Macy's were to open a department store in downtown Seattle, which 
is Nordstrom's home turf," Lindenmayer said. "I guarantee you that Nordstrom 
would behave a little differently than they do in other markets, probably 
getting more aggressive on pricing and raising their visibility, 
advertising-wise, in an effort to protect its turf." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Price Savers is entering the San Diego County market with both 
feet. In fact, the membership-only chain is looking to nail down two more 
locations over the next year in the central and south parts of the county. The 
Vista store will employ about 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Explain It 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't explain why we are the first" discount chain to challenge Price 
in San Diego County, Price Savers chief financial officer Richard Eisinger said 
Monday. "We have no inside information, no easy explanation for it." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on the competitive aspects of going up against Price in 
San Diego, saying only that its rival is "good, honest competition." 
</P>
<P>
Eisinger said Price Savers chose the Vista location for its high demographics 
-- population growth and income levels -- and because the North County coastal 
area is without a discount warehouse outlet. The nearest Price Club store to 
the Price Savers site is in San Marcos, 5 miles east on California 78. 
</P>
<P>
Membership for both chains is restricted to government employees, business 
owners, credit union members and other selected groups. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is not the first market in which Price Savers has challenged Price 
Co. head-on. By opening two stores in the Phoenix area last summer, the chain 
became Price's first competitor in that market as well. Eisinger said both 
outlets are "doing well." 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone Monday, Price Co. Executive Vice President Giles Bateman 
declined to comment on Price Savers' entry into the San Diego market. 
</P>
<P>
Closely held Price Savers was a subsidiary of Kroger Co. of Cincinnati, a 
supermarket and food processing company, until April, when the company was 
bought by five of its top managers, including founder and chief executive 
Thomas Grimm, with financing assistance from Goldman Sachs. Kroger retained a 
small interest in the chain. 
</P>
<P>
With only 13 outlets now open, Price Savers has grown at a "methodical pace" 
relative to other chains, Eisinger said, but still is the fifth-largest 
cash-and-carry discount chain -- after Price Co., Costco, PACE and Sam's 
Wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
The cautious approach has paid off, he said. Unlike some of its competitors, 
Price Savers has been profitable over the past two years. It will book sales of 
about $700 million this fiscal year, or about 27% more than 1988, he said. 
Sales growth at stores open a year or more will be between 18% and 20% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The chain obviously has a liking for California. Of its 13 outlets, five are 
located in Southern California: Irvine, Montclair, Stanton, South Gate and City 
of Industry. Over the next several months, new Price Savers will open in 
Roseville and Rancho Cordova, both near Sacramento. The chain plans to grow to 
19 outlets in total by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Price Savers is the anchor tenant of the 30-acre Vista Gateway Regional 
Shopping Center. At the ground-breaking ceremony Friday, City Manager Morris 
Vance said the shopping center as a whole should generate up to $1 million in 
tax revenues for Vista by 1992, thanks in large part to Price Savers. 
</P>
<P>
The city offered Price Savers and the shopping center developers favorable 
terms on the city-owned land in order to help attract the chain, Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
"Price Savers is going to present Price Club with some good competition," Vance 
said. "They lay out their merchandise in a better way. I walked into the Irvine 
(Price Savers) store and I could tell where things were." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kent Rademacher, Price Savers' regional manager based in Stanton, has no 
illusions about competing with Price Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask your typical San Diegan where the nearest Price Club is, they could 
tell you. I doubt if he or she could tell you where the nearest K mart is," 
Rademacher said. "Just like McDonald's is a household word to kids, Price Club 
is a household word to business members." 
</P>
<P>
"People are naturally going to ask, 'Why should we shop with you? What's going 
to be different?' "

BUOYED BY RECENT REVERSAL, CANADIAN BUYS 6% OF PERFECTDATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week a Canadian investor announced that he had bought 6% of PerfectData, a 
Simi Valley office and computer products firm that has lost $6.8 million since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Sidney S. 
Deuitch of Ontario revealed that he paid $125,000 to buy 192,307 shares in 
PerfectData. 
</P>
<P>
Despite PerfectData's long stretch of financial problems, Deuitch said, "I know 
the computer industry, and I know PerfectData is in a hot area." Deuitch, who 
is the chief executive officer of Data Accessories Corp., a Toronto-based firm 
that does business with PerfectData, said: "In my mind there's no question 
they've turned around." 
</P>
<P>
Deuitch is encouraged because in the third quarter that ended Dec. 31, 1988, 
PerfectData reported its first profitable quarter since 1985, as it earned 
$25,000 on sales of $966,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even that slight profit is a positive step because PerfectData has been on a 
long uphill climb. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1986, the company 
lost $4.5 million on sales of $5.5 million. In the next two fiscal years, it 
lost $946,000 on sales of $4.1 million and $287,000 on sales of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the company has broadened its products line recently, and Lee Mannheimer, 
PerfectData's chief executive officer, believes that its cleaners for fax 
machines and laser printers could turn into a profitable line. 
</P>
<P>
Despite PerfectData's troubles, when Mannheimer became PerfectData's CEO in 
November, 1986, he was brimming with confidence. "My thinking was that I was 
Superman, and we could turn this thing around in a year," he said. "What I came 
to realize was that I had inherited a brain-dead company." In fact, the maker 
of cleaning devices for computer disk drives, which are data storage devices, 
hadn't even computerized its own record-keeping. The biggest problem at 
PerfectData, Mannheimer said, was that PerfectData lacked a long-term game plan 
-- and it made at least two big mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
First, it had staked much of its business in the early 1980s on a line of 
sophisticated cleaning machines for removable hard disks, another computer data 
storage device. But by 1986, such hard disks largely had been replaced by disks 
that did not have to be cleaned. In 1987, PerfectData bailed out, selling the 
rights to the cleaning machine to a former employee. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, within a matter of months in 1985, the company had bought in and sold 
out of the floppy disk business at a time when the world markets were flooded 
with floppies. Floppy disks are flexible plates that store computer data. 
PerfectData ended up with 1.5 million disks and had to write off about $2.5 
million in investments associated with that product line. 
</P>
<P>
Mannheimer's main accomplishment so far has been to cut costs while maintaining 
sales, so that PerfectData's losses have slowly narrowed. In addition to 
selling off its original line of business, the firm moved in 1987 from 
Chatsworth to Simi Valley, saving $63,600 a year in rent alone. 
</P>
<P>
And since late 1986, PerfectData also has laid off about 15 of its original 45 
employees. The savings reduced PerfectData's cost of sales -- the money devoted 
to purchasing raw materials and converting them into finished products -- from 
96% of sales in the year that ended March 31, 1986 to 53% of sales two years 
later.

OWNERS OF JUDY'S CONSIDER SELLING CLOTHING CHAIN FOR $31 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judy's, the Van Nuys-based clothing store chain, is holding discussions about 
selling the company to an unidentified, out-of-state clothing concern in a 
$31-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement announced Monday, the Israel family, which controls 
78% of Judy's stock, will not sell its shares to another company for 110 days. 
The unidentified party has tentatively agreed to pay at least $6.71 per share 
of Judy's stock, according to Marcia Israel, Judy's founder and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Judy's stock closed Monday at $5 per share, which was down 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, if the would-be buyer doesn't go ahead with the 
deal or offers less than $6.71 a share, it will have to pay Judy's up to 
$150,000. If the Israels refuse a bid of at least $6.71 per share, they would 
have to pay the proposed buyer's transaction costs up to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Israel said negotiations with the unidentified company began early in June. 
Israel, 68, said she was willing to sell the company because she didn't believe 
that she had sufficiently skilled managers in place who would be able to 
succeed her. And having to groom new managers would take some time. "It would 
be a long haul, and none of us is immortal," Israel said. Her husband, Lawrence 
Israel, Judy's chairman of the board, is 72. 
</P>
<P>
The Israels own their 78% of Judy's stock along with their two daughters. It 
would be worth about $24 million at the $6.71 a share buyout price. 
</P>
<P>
If the takeover goes through, Marcia Israel will step down as Judy's chief 
executive officer and will be paid $1 million over five years as part of a 
one-year consulting and non-compete agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the tentative agreement call for the buyer to acquire all of Judy's 
outstanding stock but to continue to operate the chain under its current name. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the possible takeover comes as Judy's has been struggling to 
boost its profits after several poor years. Judy's was founded 40 years ago by 
Israel, who at the time was a model. She said she was inspired to open her own 
store because she couldn't find anything she liked to wear. For many years, she 
seemed to have a gift for knowing what young women wanted to wear. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as the fiscal year that ended in January, 1986, Judy's turned a 
$1.2-million profit on sales of $56.7 million. But since then, Israel seems to 
have lost her touch. Judy's profits slid to $426,000 in 1987 and to a mere 
$7,000 in 1988. For its latest fiscal year, which ended in January, the company 
would have lost $248,000 were it not for a tax adjustment. Meanwhile, sales 
essentially have been flat for four years. In the quarter that ended in April, 
Judy's lost $195,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible, terrible letdown to go 40 years with terrific profits and 
then have these two years," Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
For whoever winds up with control of Judy's, the major problem will be how to 
cope with the company's chief market, a notoriously fickle group of consumers 
called "juniors." Today, the Judy's chain consists of 70 women's clothing 
stores and 34 men's clothing stores in five Western states, chiefly California. 
Both the men's and women's stores sell sportswear and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Judy's is best known for selling moderately priced but trendy clothes that 
attract not only teen-agers but women in their 30s and even 40s who can fit 
into the slim-cut, stylish clothes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Competition 
</P>
<P>
Joel Knapp, president of Judy Knapp, a Los Angeles clothing manufacturer, said 
Judy's has plenty of competition, including other retailers such as Contempo, 
Cherokee and the billion-dollar chain The Limited. 
</P>
<P>
Another local fashion industry observer said: "Judy's is getting squeezed by 
the titans who really have their act together. And they're getting squeezed by 
the up-and-comers who are doing innovative marketing. A store like Judy's that 
has been around awhile is going to lose some market." 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Israel blames the company's recent slide on her decision to delegate 
clothes-buying authority a few years ago. She said she took that step because 
of repeated criticism of her management style. "The industry said it was a 
one-man show," Israel said. "The retailers, manufacturers kept saying I didn't 
know how to delegate. 
</P>
<P>
"It turns out that I was right; they were wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Problems 
</P>
<P>
Israel said delegating too much authority meant that Judy's suffered through 
several years of chronic overbuying and underbuying, leading to markdowns and 
low sales. 
</P>
<P>
Israel also believes that her stores lost the sharp definition it takes to 
appeal to her customers. "When the customer becomes confused about what she's 
going to find at a particular store, you lose ground," she said. "The customer 
walks away." 
</P>
<P>
About six months ago, Israel looked at the company's dismal earnings and 
decided that she'd had enough. Since then, she has been directing inventory and 
merchandising and trying to forge an unambiguous fashion image for Judy's. She 
has been trying to cut personnel costs, she said, reclassifying some employees 
to lower-paying jobs and laying off 10 truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
But in many ways, Israel has continued to run the company like a private one. 
In Judy's latest proxy statement, for instance, Israel said she planned to cut 
her annual pay from $150,000 to $58,000. But she recently changed her mind, 
saying there's no need to take a pay cut because she thinks that the company 
has shown signs of coming back. She points to a 27% jump in same-store sales 
from mid-May to mid-June compared to the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since she started the company, Judy's has been run the way Israel wants 
to run it. The roots of Judy's reach to the years immediately after World War 
II, when Los Angeles' defense-based economy, still gearing down from wartime 
production demands, was doing a poor job of meeting the needs of fashionable 
women, Israel said. In 1946, when she couldn't find any "young" clothing to 
wear, she borrowed $1,000 from her mother and opened a 7-foot by 10-foot 
hole-in-the-wall store on Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles. "It was the 
first young boutique of our generation," Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
She picked the name Judy's because it was short enough to fit on the skinny 
storefront. She later named one of her daughters Judy. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1960s, Judy's stores were seen as trend-setters. According to Knapp, 
"They were unique. They were the first to capitalize on the emergence of the 
junior customer." And some teen-agers were only too glad to take part in the 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
Connie DaVersa, an adult free-lance garment buyer in Los Angeles today but an 
impulse-buying California teen-ager in the late 1960s, remembered her own 
weakness for Judy's stores. "It was the place to shop. They had great displays 
of what kind of things would go together to encourage you to buy a whole 
outfit. They would put different colors together that you wouldn't have thought 
about combining. If you saw it at Judy's, you figured, ooh, it must be cool." 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, the Israels sold their 17-store chain to Beck Industries for about $8 
million. Within two years, though, Beck had filed for bankruptcy protection, 
and in 1971, the Israels bought the company back for what Marcia Israel has 
said was significantly less than the selling price. A year later, the couple 
took the company public. 
</P>
<P>
The chain expanded rapidly during the 1970s, largely by plowing profits back 
into growth. It reached its peak profits in 1984, when Judy's earned $1.5 
million on sales of $46.7 million. Soon after, the slide began. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's recent problems, the Israels have continued to do well. 
Besides their combined $300,000 salaries, the Israels took home about $182,000 
last year in dividends. Moreover, they own a separate company that Judy's paid 
$288,000 last year to provide security systems at the clothing stores.

JUDY'S INC. AT A GLANCE

Judy's operates a chain of 70 women's and 34 men's apparel stores for teenagers 
and young adults in California and four other western states. The Van 
Nuys-based company, founded with one store in 1946, has about 1,000 employees.

DYNABOOK SEES LAPTOP OPENING NEW CHAPTER IN COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past eight years, former IBM and Tandon executive Dan H. Wilkie has 
become one of the industry's best-known makers of computers for the desk. Now 
he's making a computer for the lap. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Wilkie, along with some of the Silicon Valley's biggest investors, 
joined the highly competitive laptop computer market when they introduced a 
portable computer small enough to fit in a briefcase, yet with the power and 
memory of a desktop machine. A Westlake Village resident, Wilkie, 46, will be 
chief executive of the new company, Dynabook Technologies Corp., based in San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Dynabook machine is attracting a lot of attention in 
the computer business because some of high-technology's best-known money men 
have put up $22 million to start the company. In addition, some computer 
experts believe the Dynabook machine advances the power and versatility of 
laptop computers, a $5-billion-a-year market that is one of the industry's 
fastest-growing segments. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in June, 1987, Dynabook's main backer is the Palo Alto venture capital 
firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and two of its partners, Vinod Khosla 
and John Doerr. Both men played key roles in starting and financing Sun 
Microsystems in Mountain View, one of the computer industry's fastest-growing 
companies in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experienced Investors 
</P>
<P>
Other prominent investors in Dynabook include the Wall Street firm Goldman 
Sachs &amp; Co., the Silicon Valley investment firm Sequoia Capital and Mitch 
Kapor, who founded Lotus Development, the Boston-based software company best 
known for its Lotus 1-2-3 program. Investors have 85% of the company, with the 
company's managers controlling 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Wilkie, who plans to keep his home in Westlake Village while 
working in San Jose, is to get the machine made and sold. He expects 
significant numbers of the machine to be available this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Wilkie was a key member of the team of IBM executives who 
designed that company's first personal computer, which set the standard for 
office personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1985, Wilkie was recruited by Tandon founder Sirjang Lal (Jugi) Tandon 
to oversee the company's transition from a maker of disk drive data storage 
devices to personal computers. Along with Wilkie, three other former IBM 
executives, H. L. Sparks, Joseph A. Sarubbi and William Sydnes, were recruited. 
All have left Tandon, and Sarubbi has joined Wilkie at Dynabook. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of the IBM executives got Tandon a lot of press. And, for a while, 
the company turned a solid profit selling computers, although mostly because 
sales in Europe were strong. 
</P>
<P>
But Tandon, based in Moorpark, has yet to crack the domestic market, and its 
results lately have been dismal. In the year that ended Dec. 31, Tandon lost 
$19.9 million. In the first quarter ended that March 31, the company lost $9.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left Tandon 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie left Tandon in August, 1987, when the executive suite became too 
crowded. Jugi Tandon wanted to do more operational duties himself. In addition, 
a bigger role in the company was being taken by personal computer pioneer Chuck 
Peddle, one-time head of Victor Technologies who was Tandon's executive vice 
president and chief operating officer. Peddle has since left Tandon, company 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Wilkie was approached by Khosla and Doerr, who asked him to 
help launch Dynabook. 
</P>
<P>
The idea Khosla and Doerr had for a computer was inspired by the "Dynabook" 
concept developed in the late 1970s by Alan Kay, one of high-technology's 
seminal thinkers who works for Apple Computer. The term is short for "Dynamic 
Book." What Kay envisioned was a powerful computer that people would carry 
around, much like they carry around notebooks. Wilkie was given a starting 
budget and told to check whether new technological advances -- such as portable 
computer screens that are easier to read and the development of smaller, 3 
1/2-inch disk drive storage equipment -- could be tied together to create a 
more powerful portable computer that would emulate Kay's concept. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they said: 'Here's an idea we have and $400,000. See if there is a 
market,' " Wilkie said. 
</P>
<P>
Laptop computers typically are sold as adjuncts to desktop machines. Users buy 
one computer for the desk, and a separate portable one. 
</P>
<P>
Dynabook's machine, which weighs about 14 pounds with its screen attached and a 
battery installed, is designed to hook into a conventional screen in the 
office. When it is being used while traveling or at home, it is connected to a 
flat, removable screen. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, which is expected to sell for more than $5,000 with a hard-disk 
storage device installed, was built so that it can be fitted with different 
screens, printers, power-supply units and computer pieces, much like the body 
of a camera can be fitted with different lenses. 
</P>
<P>
It can accommodate hard disks of either 20 megabytes or 40 megabytes. A 
40-megabyte drive is able to store up to 40 million characters. 
</P>
<P>
Finis Conner, chief executive of Conner Peripherals, a San Jose company that is 
supplying disk drives for the Dynabook machine, said that the company's obvious 
challenge is battling established portable computer companies such as Zenith, 
NEC and, most notably, Compaq Computer, which also makes a powerful laptop. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter, a Redwood City industry newsletter, calls 
the Dynabook computer a "really attractive machine in terms of performance." 
</P>
<P>
Alsop is most uncomfortable with Dynabook predictions that it will reach $100 
million in sales in the first year of operation, because the industry is 
unpredictable and the laptop computer market is competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like people to make outrageous statements like that," Alsop said. "If 
you do a good job, then you become a $100-million company. You don't become a 
$100-million company by projecting it."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES HAS $200 MILLION IN ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Industries said it received new orders of more than $200 million from 
Ford and General Motors for aluminum wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys company said that the orders will cover the model years 1990 and 
1991 and that they should boost Superior's sales significantly in the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Superior earned $13.1 million on revenue of $200.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The orders from Ford call for five new wheel models in addition to the 24 now 
produced. The General Motors orders call for 12 new models in addition to the 
17 produced.

'STEPPING OUT' TAPS INTO NEW ROUTINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"No, dear -- your other left foot!" yells Mavis (Susan Barnes) as she leads her 
middle-aged tapsters through a routine in "Stepping Out" at the Pasadena 
Playhouse. You'll love Mavis. You may not quite know what to do with the play. 
</P>
<P>
Like his characters, playwright Richard Harris understands the general effect 
that is wanted, but has trouble putting it all together. He can be funny and he 
can be serious; but he can't be both things at the same time. This makes for a 
lumpy evening. 
</P>
<P>
The general idea is to tell us about the people who take Mavis' once-a-week 
adult-education tap class -- seven women and one man. The man (Don Amendolia) 
is terribly shy, but so are the women, underneath. Will they be able to rise to 
the occasion when Mavis tries to turn them into a tap company for a charity 
show? 
</P>
<P>
Act I presents the situation as a bit of a cartoon, a North London equivalent 
of Robert Harling's Deep South beauty-shop comedy, "Steel Magnolias," a big hit 
for the Playhouse last year. We get to know Mavis and her klutzy gang, and 
decide that they are good sorts, really, even the tidier-than-thou Vera (Sybil 
Lines). The effect is, however, a bit bland. One kept wishing the time were 
1942, so that Harris could bring in an air raid. 
</P>
<P>
Act II delivers a whole crate-full of dramatic interest. (It arrives at about 
the same time as the hats for the amateur show.) Somebody has ratted on 
somebody's husband; somebody's stepdaughter may be having an affair with her 
stepfather; somebody's plaster cast may hide a slashed wrist; somebody is 
pregnant. Suddenly the play is full of questions, which one rather expects will 
be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we cut to the finale, where we find out that our friends did 
eventually learn to manage a cane and a hat at the same time. Sunday night's 
Playhouse audience cheerfully took this as sufficient evidence that each of the 
characters had also achieved a major personal breakthrough -- certainly that's 
the gist of Roland Young's smiling choreography. 
</P>
<P>
But all we really know is that Mavis has finally drilled a routine into their 
heads. Where the new self-esteem comes from and how deep it goes, isn't dealt 
with. A healthy chunk of the play is simply missing, either because Harris 
never wrote it, or because somebody induced him to cut it before it got to the 
West End and Broadway. Those who attend "Stepping Out" will have to take a good 
deal on faith. 
</P>
<P>
The performers prove themselves all the way, however. Sandy Duncan was to have 
played Mavis, the dance teacher. Duncan is a joyous performer, but you wonder 
if she would have done as well as Susan Barnes in conveying the strain of 
running a class like this -- the exasperation that a talented artist feels in 
the face of people who don't have a clue as to what it's about, yet who have to 
be cossetted if one wants to keep eating. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes has a fine scene when she can't keep the lid down any longer. There's 
also a wonderful quiet moment when she puts on an old Artie Shaw tape and 
dances by herself in the dark, just for the pleasure of it. It's a much deeper 
moment than the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Amendolia directed the show, and also gives a beautiful performance as the 
bashful Geoffrey, a man who is almost not there. Without belaboring the point, 
Amendolia suggests why he is not there. Deborah May is less successful at 
showing us what is beneath the leggy Maxine's wisecracks about her teen-age 
son, but then it's tough role: Harris doesn't seem to know Maxine very well 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Lines is fun as the compulsive Vera, a natural enemy to such free souls as 
Sheryl Sciro's Sylvia and Gwen Shepherd's Rose -- but you know what they say 
about the Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady. Janet Eilber perhaps overdoes the 
fears of the terrorized Andy, another tough call. Victoria Boothby is spot-on 
as the crosspatch pianist, Mrs. Fraser. In sum, Mavis' gang are a likable bunch 
of clumsies and we're pleased for them when they finally learn not to look at 
the floor, but the final scorecard on "Stepping Out" reads: Dance 10, Plot 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Tuesdays-Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. and Sundays at 2 
and 7 p.m. Closes July 16. Tickets $25. 39 S. El Molino Ave., Pasadena. (818)

GARVEY GOES TO BAT FOR TALK RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a headset cradling his ears and a mike at his lips, former baseball star 
Steve Garvey stepped up to the plate of talk radio before dawn Monday and, when 
he emerged 3 1/2 hours later, not a hair on his gleaming chestnut head appeared 
out of place. For that matter, barely an emotion or an opinion seemed ruffled 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who has had his share of controversy in recent months involving charges 
of two out-of-wedlock paternities, sounded about as smooth and seamless as he 
looked in a fresh white shirt and red tie speckled with figures of tennis 
players. The 40-year-old celebrity, who has been hired to woo the baby-boom 
audience to XTRA-AM by hosting a weekday talk show from 5:30 to 9 a.m., was 
aided by a bevy of friendly, prearranged call-in guests, including Los Angeles 
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, who called him "a wonderful person." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't doing anything at that hour of the morning anyway," Garvey said at 
one point of his early-to-bed, early-to-rise regimen. "It gets your energy 
level up." 
</P>
<P>
If Garvey's voice was low and perhaps a bit tired as he launched "XTRA Morning 
Update with Garvey and Co." at 5:30, within the hour he sounded peppy as he did 
the lead-in for news updates about embattled Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose 
and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's latest "haunting problem with Chappaquiddick." 
(The jury foreman from the 20-year-old case was quoted in Newsweek as saying 
"there was a cover-up" to save Kennedy's political career.) 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who retired from baseball before the 1988 season after an 18-year 
career as a first baseman with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego 
Padres, said after his first XTRA show that he had "always thought politics 
would be four to six years down the road" once he finished playing baseball, 
and that that ambition still holds. He has expressed interest in seeking the 
Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat. Garvey is also founder and 
chairman of Garvey Marketing Group, a La Jolla-based sports marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this would just be a nice forum for me to express my views and to 
share insights and knowledge," he said of the radio show. ". . . Gosh, this is 
the chance every day for me to start my day with a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
He said the format of the show would be split "60/40" between sports and 
entertainment interviews, and noted that he would like to do on-air profiles of 
"the Kevin Costners, the Emma Samms and the Jane Seymours." 
</P>
<P>
On his first day out, it was mostly baseball and sports that he talked about, 
giving equal time to Lasorda and Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn. But Garvey 
expressed few of his own opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with XTRA sports director Lee Hamilton, for example, who said he 
believes Rose "damaged himself at the gambling tables of America" and compared 
Rose's alleged gambling activities to the Chicago White Sox scandals of 1919, 
Garvey limited himself to asking questions. At one point he asked about the 
value of taking the testimony of "convicted felons" against Rose. But at 
another he noted "how important it is to keep the game clean." And when Lasorda 
had talked about the Reds fans mounting banners at their stadium in support of 
Rose, Garvey simply listened. 
</P>
<P>
When an interviewer later mentioned that it was hard to tell what he really 
felt, Garvey said with a broad grin, "Oh, good," explaining that he intended to 
offer his opinions only when asked. 
</P>
<P>
Off the air, he did just that. Garvey said that if Rose bet on baseball, he 
should be suspended "for a year," but if he bet on his team, he should be 
"banned for a lifetime." He added that there "should be due process." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey also disclosed off the air, in response to a question, that he is the 
father of a San Diego woman's 4-month-old daughter, which had been one of the 
two paternity charges against him. He said he is providing for the child. 
Garvey has two adolescent daughters from his marriage to Cyndy Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment about an alleged paternity involving the pregnancy of an 
Atlanta television editor to whom he had been engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Garvey married interior decorator Candace Thomas, who has 
two daughters from a former marriage. A black Mercedes station wagon, bearing 
plates "Th Garvs," sat at the front of the radio station's building. 
</P>
<P>
If sports was the dominant theme -- including in-studio guest Scott Hamilton, 
an Olympic gold medalist in ice-skating -- Garvey's personal life clearly was 
the program's sub-text. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to Tom Brookshire, a former pro-football player with the Philadelphia 
Eagles and now a sportscaster for all-sports radio station WIP in Philadelphia, 
Garvey said matter-of-factly that "the press takes off on, they take advantage 
of people like us who are straightforward and honest." 
</P>
<P>
A pre-taped interview with Bob Hope had an edge of innuendo as Hope noted, 
speaking of massages, that he has "a masseur here (Burbank), a masseur in Palm 
Springs and a masseur on the way." Garvey, later acknowledging the innuendo 
with a nod, insisted he did not mind. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed a bit uncomfortable on the air when a caller identified as John from 
Newport Beach said he was on Garvey's side in his personal battles. "I know 
this is going to strike a chord," John began, then compared Garvey's situation 
to that of Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs, who is being sued for 
palimony by his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
John said press reports about Garvey's personal problems are "entirely unfair" 
when an athlete's "performance on the field" is "exemplary." But then John 
added that he didn't know how to treat Garvey, considering that Garvey has now 
become part of the media himself. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I can go both ways," Garvey responded dryly. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey's worst moments came toward the end of his morning. KFMB-TV morning host 
Jerry G. Bishop, whose interview with Garvey was simulcast on both XTRA and his 
own "Sun-Up San Diego" show, started with welcoming chit-chat, then threw a 
verbal curve ball. Saying it was time to get serious, Bishop asked how Garvey 
felt about all the attention to his personal life, including those jokes about 
Garvey that Hope delivered at the Oscar ceremonies in March. 
</P>
<P>
Rather adroitly, Garvey told Bishop that when Hope said to him, "You provided a 
lot of great material for me," he replied simply, "It's a pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He added that after a while, "you got to keep perspective" and indicated that 
he has no problems with his listeners. "I love the public," Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
The two hosts went back to talking about Garvey's program but Bishop had one 
more lick to go. "A belated happy Father's Day," Bishop said, signing off.

LIVING, LOVING ON A POWDER KEG IN 'NEBRASKA'

<TEXT>
<P>
"I had to kill my dog today," is the unlikely opening line of Keith Reddin's 
"Nebraska," a lean and hungry play about life at the bottom of a missile silo. 
</P>
<P>
This seeming disconnection between a spoken line and a play's larger intent is 
not accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin and "Nebraska" specialize in being indirect -- a behavior characteristic 
more commonly known in today's psychological circles as avoidance or let's 
pretend this isn't really happening. 
</P>
<P>
What isn't supposed to be happening is not the death of a dog but the 
possibility of nuclear extinction. "Nebraska" (which opened Sunday at the La 
Jolla Playhouse) is set on a Midwestern Air Force base where intercontinental 
ballistic missiles are kept, encased in silos 70 feet underground. They are our 
answer to nuclear attack. "Enabling" them is the final resort in a final 
solution (or dissolution). For that reason it takes a complex number of steps 
to launch them. And the men condemned to learning these steps by rote as well 
as enduring 24-hour watches in the void of these living tombs are also trained 
to consider this numbing inactivity an honor. 
</P>
<P>
One of these men is Dean Swift (Rob Knepper), who reminds his erring wife, "I'm 
in the Air Force, Julie. It's not work." So what is it?, asks Julie (Barbara 
Howard). 
</P>
<P>
Duty, replies Swift. 
</P>
<P>
If, suggests Reddin, you want to know what the permanent vacuum of this 
brinksmanship, this perpetual readiness for the Apocalypse, does to people, 
watch and listen. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Swift and his wife avoid their feelings and talk about dogs and driving 
and wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Swift's commanding officer, Gurney (James Rebhorn), fight impotence and 
boredom by trying (ineptly) to be one of the guys. Watch him heap unmerited 
praise on his flirtatious, philandering wife, Carol (Robin Bartlett). Watch him 
fiddle with Wagner while Carol does a slow burn. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Swift and his partner, Fielding (Adam Coleman Howard), in a walking 
cartoon of the self-proclaimed happy single) talk -- or not -- in the 
treacherous emptiness of that "duty" 70 feet under. 
</P>
<P>
Watch and listen to Kim (Susan Berman), the radar specialist, and Barnes (John 
Cameron Mitchell), the mindless clerk, interact with some or all of the above 
at the bar on base -- or at the dismal cookout Gurney dreams up to boost 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
Watch and listen to everyone sooner or later betraying everyone else, as the 
senses derail trying to cope with the barrenness of the mind and the endless 
Nebraska plain. In time, adultery, alcoholism and subtler forms of brutishness 
mushroom all over the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It's a chilling view: sour, dangerous, provocative and surprisingly funny. 
Director Les Waters (who has staged other Reddin plays elsewhere in the past) 
knows how to be faithful to his playwright's motives while at the same time 
creating an unexpected amount of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
The company is exceptionally well chosen. Bartlett as Carol is ironic and quite 
wise without becoming bitter. Rebhorn's Gurney is a tragically well-meaning 
man, so overwhelmed by his feelings of inferiority that he's unable to 
coherently complete a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman Howard as Fielding has all the attributes of a scoundrel thinly 
disguised as a harmless happy-go-lucky bachelor. 
</P>
<P>
But it is ultimately Knepper's Swift who is the centerpiece of the play. He is 
the prototypical tragic hero whose rude awakening we follow, from the 
well-meaning serviceman he once was to the corrupted husband and officer he has 
so imperceptibly become. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, Berman and Barbara Howard contribute clearly defined supporting 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
Costumes, lighting and sound (David C. Woolard, Stephen Strawbridge and John 
Kilgore, respectively) are unobtrusive. Designer Loy Arcenas' set of 
all-encompassing concrete conveys the suffocation of arid entombment in the 
silo control center while smoothly transforming into a variety of other locales 
-- a bar, a motel, an office and two homes. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the unlikely marriage of text (the perpetual deathwatch) and subtext 
(the profound unhappiness, boredom and waste it engenders) that has a gathering 
power. Reddin has turned a neat trick: He has issued a stern warning with a 
play that never stoops to preach.

An attorney for Rob Lowe asked a judge in Atlanta on Monday to throw out a suit 
accusing the actor of videotaping a teen-age girl during a sex act. Edgar Neely 
told U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell that the girl's mother, who brought 
the suit, has no legal standing to sue under a Georgia law that allows parents 
to seek damages over the seduction of a minor child. The judge did not indicate 
when he would rule. Lowe, 25, is accused of making the sexually explicit tape 
of Lena Jan Parsons, then 16, and another woman in his hotel suite during last 
summer's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. The suit was filed May 12 
by Lena Arlene Wilson, the girl's mother, who is seeking unspecified damages. 
Neely argued Monday that even if the allegations were true, the seduction law 
is probably unconstitutional, that Wilson is not the girl's custodial parent as 
required by law and that Wilson suffered no direct emotional harm. Wilson does 
not live with her daughter, Neely said. J. Hue Henry, Wilson's lawyer, argued 
that Lowe seduced Parsons and that Wilson has suffered direct harm. "One could 
see how a parent could and would suffer extreme emotional distress" from seeing 
such a tape, he said. Lowe did not attend the hearing. In court papers, Lowe 
denied he "committed any wrongful acts giving rise to liability." Lowe's 
attorneys also have filed papers accusing Wilson and Henry of using 
"extortionist tactics" to force Lowe to pay as much as $500,000 to avoid bad 
publicity. They also accused Parsons of helping circulate the tape. ALEENE

Here's a new bit of trivia for Batfans. In Dallas, a securities dealer named 
Stephen Batman has an assistant named Robin, and his life has become so crazed 
with crank calls since a certain new film came out that he may have to get his 
batphone unlisted. Although he may change his phone number, he says he 
definitely will not change his name. Originally from Dodge City, Kan., not 
Gotham City, Batman's grandfather did a study of the unusual family name, which 
originated in England, and found about 300 Batmans in the United States. 
Batman, 33, was a grade-schooler when the television series came out and his 
own popularity rocketed as a result. Now, he says, "I take a lot of kidding. I 
have a 3-year-old batson, my newborn baby is a batbaby, I have a batdog, and 
everybody at work says I drive a batmobile." As for the new "Batman" movie, 
Batman thinks it's "very good . . . And I think it will do wonders for my own 
career." He's also a baseball fan and was off to see a Texas Rangers game, 
because, well . . . it was bat night. ALEENE MacMINN

A spoonful of TV makes the medicine go down. A new 24-hour a day, in-house 
children's television channel will go on the air today at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center. The commercial-free, nonprofit channel is being donated by DIC 
Enterprises, and will showcase such DIC-produced kidvid favorites as "The Real 
Ghostbusters," "ALF," "ALF Tales," "The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin," "The New 
Archies," "Inspector Gadget" and "Zoobilee Zoo." "We felt we should do what we 
could to prove the adage that laughter is the best medicine," says Andy 
Heyward, president, DIC Enterprises Inc. For his part, Dr. David Rimoin, 
director of pediatrics at the hospital, says a patient's outlook is crucial to 
the healing process and the new children's channel is "just what the doctor 
ordered." ALEENE MacMINN

U.S. CONFRONTS BONN ON POISON GAS AID TO IRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of quiet investigation, the Bush Administration has uncovered 
information that a private West German company has been arranging the sale of a 
significant quantity of chemicals that are suspected of being used to improve 
Iran's chemical warfare capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The German government's earlier resistance to subtle pressure led Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III to use strong language in his discussions here last 
week with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, which was 
followed by a formal letter to the Bonn government over the weekend urging it 
to prevent the private sale of chemicals to Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have suspected that private German companies have been arranging 
sporadic sales of what are known as "precursors," the basic components that 
when mixed together make a variety of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration sources said that, even if delivered, however, the 
chemicals would not be sufficient for Iran to equal the poison gas capability 
of neighboring Iraq, which made widespread use of chemical weapons during the 
eight-year Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians are simply not that far along," a U.S. official said. "But 
getting access to precursors is one of the necessary steps in improving 
capability. This is enough to make a difference." Bush Administration sources 
added that the Iranians have been working secretly to purchase precursors for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they suspect that the key middleman in the alleged deal is 
Kharim Ali Sobhani, an Iranian envoy and businessman who they say was indicted 
previously in the United States for export violations involving chemicals and 
high technology. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the recent controversy over sales of chemical precursors by private 
West German companies to Libya, U.S. sources expressed "deep regret" that Bonn 
had not sufficiently tightened restrictions on the sale of precursors to 
prevent their sale, particularly to Middle East countries that are currently in 
an arms race to improve their chemical capability. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans generally are receptive to our requests, but frankly they are slow 
to respond," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
This source said that various U.S. channels have been used to relay specific 
information on the Iranian middleman and the German company, which was not 
identified. Because the Germans were slow to respond, the Administration 
decided to put more pressure on Bonn last week. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between Washington and Bonn comes after recent accusations by 
U.S. counterterrorism officials that West Germany on several counts has bungled 
the investigation into the bombing over Scotland last December of Pan Am Flight 
103, which originated in Frankfurt. It also follows the earlier controversy 
over a West German company's reported sale of precursors for a chemical warfare 
plant in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The United States became convinced in the middle of last year that the Libyans 
were developing an advanced chemical warfare plant in Rabta, a remote desert 
complex. As in this lastest case, the United States repeatedly pressured West 
Germany and then leaked stories through the press about the sale by private 
German companies of precursors to the regime of Col. Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
That pressure led to a German investigation and pledges of greater security on 
the export of potential chemical warfare precursors. But the potential sale by 
German companies to Iran has heightened concern within the Bush Administration 
that Bonn is not following through as promised. 
</P>
<P>
A Bush Administration official said he believes that the Germans had moved 
slowly in reacting to the latest allegations of a chemical sale in part because 
of embarrassment over the earlier incidents, and in part because Bonn legally 
cannot prevent the sale of all precursors that are widely used -- particularly 
in Third World countries -- as pesticides and in industrial use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Prove 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials concede that it is often difficult to prove the intent of 
chemical precursor purchases. 
</P>
<P>
In many countries, including the United States, the sale of many precursors 
used in the manufacture of chemical weapons is not illegal. And current 
international conventions do not prohibit the manufacture of chemical weapons. 
The 1925 Geneva Protocol, signed by the United States, West Germany, Iran and 
dozens of others, only restricts the use of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for us and for them to come up with sufficient evidence, to 
gather and collect data proving that the sale of these commodities are tied to 
military usage," a State Department source said. 
</P>
<P>
At the summit of seven industrial nations that convenes in Paris July 14, the 
United States is expected to push for greater allied cooperation on preventing 
the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities.

REPORT ACCUSES ROSE OF BETTING ON REDS' GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special investigator's report to major league baseball on Pete Rose's alleged 
gambling, made public Monday by a Cincinnati judge, accuses the Cincinnati 
Reds' manager of betting not only on major league games but on his own team's 
games as well, from 1985 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Rose won a temporary restraining order Sunday, preventing baseball 
from conducting a hearing with Rose -- one was scheduled for today -- until at 
least July 6. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ohio Supreme Court, responding to a suit filed Monday by the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer, ordered Judge Norbert A. Nadel of Hamilton County Common Pleas 
Court to release the report or explain why. Nadel, the same judge who Sunday 
had issued the temporary restraining order, complied reluctantly with the 
court's order. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-page report, compiled after a four-month investigation by baseball 
investigator John M. Dowd, implicates Rose as having gambled extensively on 
baseball and Reds' games. 
</P>
<P>
"The testimony and the documentary evidence gathered in the course of the 
investigation demonstrates that Pete Rose bet on baseball, and, in particular, 
on games of the Cincinnati Reds baseball club, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 
seasons," Dowd wrote in the report. 
</P>
<P>
A key element in the report is the transcript of Dowd's interview with Ron 
Peters, an Ohio bookmaker with whom Rose allegedly placed baseball bets of up 
to $2,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange: 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: And when he bet baseball, did he bet on the Cincinnati Reds? 
</P>
<P>
Peters: Yes, he did. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: And this was at a time that he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds? 
</P>
<P>
Peters: Yes, sir. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Is there any doubt in your mind? 
</P>
<P>
Peters: Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
Peters pleaded guilty recently to charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Rose bet on Reds' games is the critical element in the case, since 
gambling on one's own baseball team has traditionally carried a lifetime ban 
from the sport. Eight members of the Chicago White Sox were given lifetime bans 
in the wake of revelations that gamblers had rigged the 1919 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Janszen of Cincinnati, who was serving a six-month sentence for tax 
evasion when the report was compiled but who has since been released, testified 
that he placed baseball bets for Rose with Peters from April 17, 1987, through 
May 13, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The report details specific incidents, described by Janszen, of Rose placing 
bets with Tommy Gioiosa, a one-time house guest of Rose, on the 1986 National 
League playoffs between the New York Mets and Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, since the investigation began, has admitted betting on other sports but 
had denied throughout that he ever bet on baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that during his deposition, Rose was shown gambling 
sheets, which investigators allege show Rose bet on baseball games, and that 
expert analysis showed the sheets were in Rose's handwriting. Rose has denied 
the writing was his. 
</P>
<P>
Another section describes Gioiosa's paying Peters $24,000 in Rose's alleged 
gambling debts at a cafe in Franklin, Ohio, in 1986. Peters recalled Gioiosa 
bringing him three $8,000 checks, all payable to cash and signed by Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, according to testimony, told Gioiosa to cash the checks because he did 
not want his name on them. Gioiosa then cashed the checks and paid Peters in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd wrote in the report that Peters' recollection of the incident is supported 
by Rose's own bank records. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is also accused in the report by Janszen of placing bets in New York and 
using Michael Bertolini of New York as his runner. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen said that Rose "within a three-month period of time . . . was in debt 
over $400,000 to the bookie in New York via Mike Bertolini, in baseball betting 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Rose denied ever placing bets with Bertolini.

CHINA DISSIDENTS REPORTED TO FLEE VIA 'ESCAPE TUNNEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

HONG KONG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that an underground "escape tunnel" has been established for Chinese 
dissidents, local and Western media sources here reported today that 
pro-democracy student leader Wuer Kaixi and two key Chinese intellectuals have 
been smuggled out of China and into this British colony. 
</P>
<P>
Wuer, who emerged at the forefront of China's crushed pro-democracy movement 
after criticizing China's hard-line Premier Li Peng on government television at 
the height of the protests, fled to safety four days ago through the nearby 
Portuguese colony of Macao and then into Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Standard 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old leader from Beijing Teachers University is among 21 students on 
the government's most-wanted list, which was created after the government and 
army suppressed the protest movement in the capital on the night of June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that hundreds of soldiers from China's People's 
Liberation Army were moved to checkpoints near the Macao border last week. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Associated Press in Hong Kong said that three other 
dissidents also have fled China through the "underground railroad." 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Wan Runnan, a businessman who heads an innovative Chinese 
computer firm and who has close links with reformers centered on former 
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. No public charges had been leveled at Wan, 
but he was believed to be on a list of Zhao supporters targeted for arrest. The 
report said he had left for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Another is Yan Jiaqi, leader of the Beijing Independent Intellectuals Assn., 
which also joined in the movement. He escaped through Hong Kong and is now in 
France, the AP said, quoting a student activist and an unnamed diplomatic 
source in the colony. 
</P>
<P>
The third, AP said, is Li Lu, a student from Nanjing University who is also one 
of the 21 student leaders being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong officials, who have allowed huge weekly demonstrations supporting the 
Beijing student movement and permitted the placing in a downtown park of a 
replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue that served as a rallying point in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square, had no official comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's usual practice for those fleeing the Chinese mainland for the 
island citadel of capitalism is to seek to prevent their entry. Military and 
police patrols, aided by listening devices, try to catch those crossing the 
border. If caught, the would-be emigrants are detained -- about a dozen are 
arrested daily -- and returned to China within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peace Corps Delayed 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Beijing said this morning 
that China has decided to postpone the start of a U.S. Peace Corps program in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Americans had been due to arrive this summer to prepare to teach English 
at Chinese institutions in the fall. The agreement had been seen as a 
breakthrough marking growing friendship between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Those ties are now strained by U.S. criticism of China's fierce crackdown on 
pro-democracy protesters and by an American decision to grant refuge in the 
U.S. Embassy in Beijing to astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent 
pro-democracy advocate, and his wife. The postponement of the Peace Corps 
program appeared to reflect these tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a letter from the China Education Assn. for International Exchanges 
(the Chinese host for the Peace Corps program), and they've told us that for 
the time being, they want to postpone the program," U.S. Embassy spokesman Andy 
Koss said. "It's not canceled. . . . We don't know how long this will be 
postponed." 
</P>
<P>
Koss declined to comment on whether the action was linked to the Fang issue. 
"We really don't have any indications of what's behind it," he said. "We just 
got a very straightforward note that they want to postpone it. Anything else is 
conjecture." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official New China News Agency announced Monday evening that the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's nominal 
legislature, will meet beginning June 29 to endorse the decisions taken by the 
party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In the first few days after the bloody June 3-4 crackdown that ended seven 
weeks of escalating pro-democracy protests, some reformist students and 
intellectuals in China had hoped that the National People's Congress could 
serve as a power base for a reformist resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement, however, made it clear that delegates to the Congress 
will operate under severe restrictions. "It is decided that the Standing 
Committee meeting will be guided by the principles adopted" at a Saturday 
meeting of the Party's 170-member Central Committee, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, according to the report, is scheduled to: 
</P>

 -- Endorse the various decisions taken by the Communist Party on Saturday, 
including the elevation of Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin to replace Zhao as 
general secretary.

In its campaign to push its version of events, the government invited some 
foreign correspondents to a tour of Tian An Men Square directed by Gen. Li 
Zhiyun, one of the commanders of the June 3-4 assault. Li said he had "no 
regrets" about any deaths and injuries inflicted during that night. 
</P>
<P>
In a pair of seemingly contradictory comments, he said, as he had on a previous 
tour for correspondents, that "the whole process was nonviolent -- no one used 
guns" -- but also that "when our troops moved to the square we received 
persistent resistance." He added: "Individuals even used guns to kill our 
warriors. We were forced to defend ourselves. This group of people got what 
they deserved." 
</P>
<P>
He agreed that some innocent people "may have been wounded" when troops battled 
their way to reach the square, but he said people had been warned not to go out 
on the streets that night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Americans 
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities also took action against two Americans -- one a teacher and 
one a student -- who have been at Nankai University in the coastal city of 
Tianjin, east of Beijing. The two have been ordered to leave China by Friday 
because of alleged involvement in the recent wave of demonstrations, a U.S. 
Embassy spokesman said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Radicia, a teacher at Nankai University, and Helen Qubain, a student 
there, were questioned several times by police before the expulsion order was 
issued, according to the embassy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to boil down to that they were expelled for 'disturbing social 
order,' " said Koss, the spokesman. "What it really means is they're accused of 
being closely involved in the student demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Koss said the two came to Beijing and spoke with consular officials at the 
embassy on Monday. He said he did not yet have information about their ages or 
hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an explosion aboard a train late Monday killed 20 people and 
seriously injured 11 in the suburbs of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency said early today that an-on-the-spot 
investigation showed that the explosion, in a passenger compartment, was caused 
by dynamite. A Shanghai official called the incident an accident, but few other 
details were available.

WORLD'S BIGGEST WHITE ELEPHANT?;

<P>
SELLING ITS TOWER MAY BE SEARS' TOUGHEST SALES JOB 
</P>

<P>
So there's this great place for sale. Big, sturdy, dynamic. Prime location, on 
the edge of the Loop financial district. The view, on a clear day, spectacular. 
It's got 110 floors, 76,000 tons of steel framework, 109 elevators and -- start 
hoarding the Windex -- 16,000 bronze-tinted panes of glass. 
</P>
<P>
Interested? The owner reportedly wants a cool $1 billion, maybe $1.2 billion, 
the biggest price tag ever on a single building. But, then again, they don't 
make them like this any more. 
</P>
<P>
And with good reason. Awesome as it is, the 16-year-old Sears Tower, at 1,454 
feet the crown jewel of Chicago's brawny, architecturally splendid skyline, 
could be a black-coated white elephant as a marketable commodity, the world's 
tallest fixer-upper. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is part of an extensive corporate overhaul at Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co., the giant retailer that has been hit by sagging sales. As part of the 
overhaul, Sears said Monday that it would shift its 6,000-employee merchandise 
group out of its landmark headquarters and into a lower-cost facility in a 
Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
But that move, to begin in 1992, will leave about half of the Tower vacant. And 
that, say real estate experts, effectively undermines the building's sales 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are openly predicting that Sears, which now terms itself the king of 
the everyday price discounters, may have to lop $200 million to $300 million or 
more off its asking price to lure a buyer -- although they may do some fiddling 
with a final deal to make it look more profitable on paper than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's opinion is that they shot themselves in the foot," said Harvey 
Camins, vice chairman of Frain, Camins &amp; Swartchild, a leading commercial 
real estate broker in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
Local news reports indicate that as many as six different financial groups led 
by American or Canadian investors have submitted bids for the building -- all 
below the $1-billion mark. Sears has refused to comment on the sale while 
negotiations are under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secretive Process 
</P>
<P>
In selling its flagship, Sears has set in motion a complicated, super-secretive 
process that is nothing like selling ladies' lingerie, socket wrenches, paint 
or even the house next door. 
</P>
<P>
There is no multiple listing service for the world's tallest building. Acting 
through its adviser on the sale, the New York investment banking firm of 
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Sears is believed to have put together a list of no 
more than 100 pension funds, insurance firms, investment companies and other 
entrepreneurs capable of financing a deal so large. 
</P>
<P>
By spring, real estate industry sources said, that list had been whittled down 
to fewer than 60 consortiums, which were sent a prospectus as thick as a Sears 
catalogue. The book was closely guarded because it contained detailed 
information on the leases of dozens of tenants now in the building, as well as 
confidential engineering and financial reports and other data. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roof Doesn't Leak 
</P>
<P>
The building is in good shape. It is sturdy, the roof does not leak and that 
nagging problem of a few years ago, when windows popped out of their frames and 
crashed onto the pavement hundreds of feet below, has been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Although important, structural considerations take a back seat to rent revenue 
projections in most large real estate sales these days. Industry analysts say 
that most bids were probably derived solely from information in the Sears book. 
</P>
<P>
If the Sears sale follows the pattern of similar transactions, the eventual 
buyers may not even set foot in the building until they take possession. And 
not until an agreement in principle has been reached will the prospective buyer 
send in engineers, consultants, architects and lawyers to verify the 
information that they relied on in devising a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Although any such process is time-consuming, it could be streamlined in the 
case of the Tower simply because so few investors have the wherewithal -- not 
to mention the good credit and the large amounts of cash Sears is expected to 
seek up front -- to purchase something so expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge and Outdated 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the Tower is an apt metaphor for the century-old company that is 
now trying to unload it -- huge, clunky and, though impressive, a bit outdated. 
Inside, there's 3.6 million square feet of office and commercial space, enough 
to cover about 64 football fields. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower was designed to fit the unique needs of Sears. It is broad at the 
bottom, where offices are filled almost exclusively by the merchandise group 
that buys the appliances, hardware, dry goods and other items for Sears stores 
and catalogue outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The more compact upper half of the building is leased to law firms, 
consultants, architects and other prestige tenants, who pay top dollar for what 
is considered prime space in the Chicago rental market. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sears will leave a corps of top corporate executives in the building, 
it plans to start vacating about 1.8 million square feet by 1992 -- about half 
the space in the building and more than half of what comes on the rental market 
in the entire central business district of Chicago in an average year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Office Glut 
</P>
<P>
The resulting office glut would make it hard for any new owner to find tenants, 
but that's only part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The areas now occupied by Sears employees are, from a rental standpoint, the 
least desirable in the building. The floors are open and cavernous -- many are 
more than an acre in size -- and better suited to clerical operations or even, 
ironically, department store display space than to the more intimate atmosphere 
preferred by tony clientele willing to pay high rents for great views and a 
chic address. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts agree that whoever buys the building will have to do extensive 
and expensive remodeling to lure renters. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a complicated sale because, at $1 billion, it is less per square foot 
substantially than many of the sales that have occurred throughout the United 
States to date," said Howard Ecker, an office relocation expert here. "But . . 
. there are very few companies in the world (that) are willing to put $1 
billion into one asset that is (16) years old, that was built for a specific 
use, that may be obsolete today." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate taxes could be another obstacle, and not just for the new owner. 
Whatever the final selling price, the value of the property will jump 
dramatically on tax rolls. And, in the world of commercial real estate, taxes 
and other expenses are customarily passed on to the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Tax pass-throughs could add as much as $500,000 to the annual rent bills of 
some of the largest existing tenants, according to Larry Debb, executive vice 
president of Chicago-based Mesirow Realty Brokerage. That could scare off 
prospective tenants as well as make present ones reluctant to renew their 
leases, Debb cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome these problems, analysts predict that the new owners would have to 
spend tens of millions of dollars to renovate the space now occupied by Sears 
as well as offer steep discounts off base rents, which typically run from $25 
to $30 a square foot a year before the add-ons. Barry Rosen, the president of 
Frain, Camins &amp; Swartchild, estimated that such costs could hit $250 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem to me like there was a systematic approach to all the problems 
of relocation, of reducing work staff . . . of selling the building or getting 
the highest price," Debb said of Sears. "I don't think anyone looked at the 
whole picture."

PANEL OKS BUDGET; TRAUMA AID INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-house conference committee reached agreement on a nearly $50-billion 
proposed state budget Monday after approving an extra $100 million from 
Proposition 99 tobacco tax money for trauma centers and emergency medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement on extra money for trauma centers and emergency services, pushed 
by Los Angeles legislators, came just hours before the conference committee 
voted 6 to 0 on the nearly $50-billion budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year that 
will begin July 1. The budget now will go back to the Assembly and Senate for 
final votes by the two houses. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the conference committee spending recommendations are adopted by 
both houses and forwarded on to the governor as the Legislature's official 
budget. This year, however, conference committee agreement is only one element 
of the complicated budget puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders are still negotiating on several 
major issues that must be resolved to pave the way for adoption of a budget. 
</P>
<P>
The issues are: 
</P>
<P>
* How to modify the voter-approved limit on government spending, so that the 
state will be free to spend a $2.5-billion tax windfall. 
</P>
<P>
* How to distribute $1.5 billion in new money for public schools and community 
colleges that has been reserved for education under terms of Proposition 98, 
which was passed by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the governor and legislative leaders reached tentative agreement on a 
10-year, $18.5-billion transportation plan, but that proposal will not be 
submitted to the Legislature for approval until all issues under negotiation 
have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
If the spending limit is not changed, Deukmejian or the Legislature will have 
to cut at least $900 million from the committee-approved budget because the 
state would lack legal authority to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
Even though key roadblocks remain, Monday's agreement by the six-member 
conference committee on the trauma-care funding proposal will help pave the way 
for budget passage. Two Los Angeles Democratic legislators on the committee -- 
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Sen. Alan Robbins -- led the fight for the 
extra money for the state's financially troubled trauma-center and 
emergency-care network. 
</P>
<P>
It comes from a pot of $545 million that will be distributed to a variety of 
medical, research and education programs as a result of voter approval last 
year of Proposition 99, which raised the tax on cigarettes by 25-cents a pack 
and made comparable increases in taxes on other tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
The exact formula for dividing up the tobacco tax money will be worked out in 
separate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, under an amendment worked out by Waters, if the separate legislation 
is not approved by Oct. 1, then the money automatically will be divided up by 
California's counties. Los Angeles County, because of its size and extensive 
trauma-care network, is expected to reap a significant windfall either way. The 
closing of trauma centers in the Los Angeles area because of budget 
difficulties has been one of the county's more pressing public health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been suffering in Los Angeles because of the closing down of trauma-care 
centers. We felt we needed to take a little extra step here so we could expand 
the level of care for trauma and ensure that people who are in accidents are 
taken care of," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rumors Circulating 
</P>
<P>
Waters' success may be short-lived. Rumors circulating around the conference 
committee were that Deukmejian may veto the money from the budget because of 
opposition from within the Administration to the use of tobacco tax money to 
support trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before the main budget was approved, the conference committee struggled 
to come up with $110 million in proposed reductions in order to boost the 
reserve for fiscal emergencies to about $870 million, a figure well below the 
target set by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, reasoning that this year's reserve was whittled down to nearly zero 
by unexpected demands for state money that developed during the year, has told 
the budget writers that he wants a reserve of $1.2 billion, in addition to a 
separate reserve for education programs of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Programs cut by the committee included a reduction of $30 million in Medi-Cal 
expenditures to hospitals, $50 million in extra funds for health programs for 
the working poor, $5 million from a pilot health program for children, $8 
million to hire additional Workers' Compensation Court judges and $17 million 
in tax relief given to farmers who agree not to sell agricultural land to 
commercial and residential developers. 
</P>
<P>
Several major spending priorities were set even before the conference committee 
began its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, pay raises for state employees, a potentially divisive matter, 
was not an issue this year because lawmakers agreed last year on a two-year pay 
package. State employees got a 6% pay raise June 1 and will receive another 4% 
raise Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allowances Hiked 
</P>
<P>
In addition, both houses of the Legislature had agreed before the conference 
committee was convened that welfare recipients would receive 4.6% increases in 
their monthly allowances. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also defused much of the tension building up over this year's budget 
when he announced June 1 that he was agreeing to substantial increases in 
budgets for mental health, youth camps, health services for the poor and 
nursing programs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
His announcement was based on the assumption that he and legislative leaders 
will be able to agree on legislation that will allow them to spend the 
$2.5-billion windfall, which resulted from unexpectedly high personal income 
tax collections. In January, when the budget picture looked much bleaker, 
Deukmejian had proposed deep cuts in the same programs.

CRITICS SAY 9TH CIRCUIT IS TOO BIG FOR THE JOB, SEEK TO SECEDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the days of the "circuit riders," when roaming appellate judges of the West 
dispensed justice in a makeshift courtroom and departed on the next stagecoach, 
it made no difference that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals spanned all 
that was known of the American frontier. 
</P>
<P>
But the frontier today runs from Arizona to Alaska, from Montana to Guam, and 
the nation's largest federal appeals court now passes judgment over a 
population of nearly 49 million. 
</P>
<P>
The circuit spans nine states and 1.4 million square miles. Judges in Pasadena 
may decide whether a man is hanged in Helena; decisions on trade disputes in 
the Northern Mariana Islands are laid to rest in San Francisco; Phoenix jurists 
may be called to set limits on Eskimo fishing rights. 
</P>
<P>
It has not made for judicial harmony. While the laws are universal, the context 
in which they are argued throughout the circuit can differ greatly: As new 
skyscrapers spring up along the Sunbelt, the Pacific Northwest is reeling 
through an economic recession. The environmental movement, a vigorous political 
force in Southern California, has of necessity taken a back seat to development 
of water and timber resources in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, residents of the West's less-urbanized states are questioning 
whether jurists from California should sit in judgment on their futures -- 
questions that have prompted a coalition of senators from the Northwest to 
mount a new move to divide the behemoth 9th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the Northwest are tired of being the tail on a huge dog," U.S. Sen. 
Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) said in introducing legislation last month with six 
other senators that would allow Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, 
Oregon and the Pacific territories to secede from the 9th Circuit and form 
their own appeals court. California, Arizona and Nevada would remain. 
</P>
<P>
"Northwestern states are simply dominated by California judges and California 
attitudes," Gorton asserted. "It is time to acknowledge that the Northwest has 
developed its own legal interests, and those interests cannot be fully 
addressed from a California perspective." 
</P>
<P>
At issue for many of the judges of the court -- who have opposed any move to 
divide the circuit -- is the concept of a federal appeals court as a regional 
arbiter of federal law designed to be a step removed from regional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
There are 13 federal circuit courts. They act as an intermediate step between 
lower federal district courts and the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling on 
constitutional appeals and resolving interpretations of the law that conflict 
from court to court. Judges are appointed by the President and serve for life. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in fact the only national court left in the United States, other than 
the Supreme Court," said former Chief Judge James Browning. "We are the only 
court which within our boundaries is represented all the points of view, 
basically all the problems, social and economic, of the whole nation. That kind 
of court can make a very positive contribution to the development of the 
federal law at the national level." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the secession movement has gained momentum, particularly in 
Oregon, where the 9th Circuit recently blocked sale of nearly 2 billion board 
feet of old-growth timber to protect the spotted owl, and in Montana and 
Washington, where the court has blocked the executions of at least three 
convicted killers. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle residents flooded the court's San Francisco headquarters with phone 
calls and telegrams in March when the court stayed the execution of Charles 
Campbell, convicted of brutally attacking and murdering a woman who had accused 
him of raping her. Campbell, who was out on work release from prison for his 
conviction in the rape case, also slashed the throat of the woman's 8-year-old 
daughter and murdered a neighbor who happened by during the rampage. One 
telegram to the court talked about "anarchy prevailing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Understanding of Issues 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I recognize that judges can dispassionately make rulings, they 
nonetheless imprint upon their rulings an understanding and philosophy and 
values that are important in their own lives and, quite frankly, I do not 
believe that the court reflects an understanding of the issues facing the 
Northwest," said Montana Atty. Gen. Marc Racicot. 
</P>
<P>
"The 9th Circuit is just an incredibly diverse area that makes it 
extraordinarily difficult for 11 members of the court to have a clear 
understanding of every aspect of the problems that confront them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that the court -- with 28 judges, three times the number of 
judges of many circuits, and a far heavier caseload -- takes too long to decide 
cases. Moreover, with most cases decided by panels of only three judges, they 
say, there is persistent conflict in the court's decision-making because judges 
are unable to keep up with the expanding case law of the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, many have voiced fears that simply breaking off a chunk 
of the circuit to serve territorial interests would threaten to create even 
greater conflicts in federal law that would eventually have to be resolved by 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Some have predicted that such a move would force creation of an entirely new 
tier of intermediate appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
The judges have pointed to a number of administrative innovations that the 
court has put into place that enable it to run efficiently, even at three times 
the number of judges considered ideal for a circuit court: special panels to 
handle bankruptcy cases, satellite courts with their own administrative 
structure, provisions for allowing a limited en banc panel of 11 judges -- 
rather than the entire court, or even a majority -- to sit to resolve conflicts 
in law within the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speeds Up Process 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the court has consistently reduced the amount of time it takes for 
cases to be decided despite a caseload that is nearly twice that of most other 
federal appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants to jump on the 9th Circuit can usually find a case that they 
can disagree with, but there aren't any well-documented administrative reasons 
for Balkanizing the West Coast that I've seen," said Chief Judge Alfred T. 
Goodwin of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not perfect, but very few human instrumentalities are. Even the telephone 
company's not perfect," he said. "I think we're doing a big job, we're getting 
a lot of work done, and we're doing it efficiently and economically and, I 
think, as well or better than we'd do if we were broken up." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the 9th Circuit was one of the most liberal appeals courts in the 
nation, heavily dominated by Democratic appointees who looked critically at 
attempts to exploit oil and gas resources in national forests, build dams on 
the remaining wild rivers of the West and move into pristine old-growth forests 
to meet a burgeoning worldwide demand for lumber. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the court has become almost evenly balanced between conservatives 
and liberals, and has gone from being one of the courts most frequently 
reversed by the Supreme Court to one of the least. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Case 
</P>
<P>
But a long line of pro-environmental decisions remain, beginning nearly 15 
years ago, when the circuit ruled against the state of Washington and in favor 
of the Indians in a dispute over salmon fishing rights. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the appeals court blocked development of a ski resort in central 
Washington and a dam on Elk Creek, a tributary of the Rogue River in southern 
Oregon, on environmental grounds. Both those decisions were unanimously 
reversed by the Supreme Court in May, lending new fodder to politicians from 
the Northwest who have argued that the 9th Circuit is out of step. 
</P>
<P>
What many court critics regarded as the last straw came earlier this year when 
a panel of the court reversed an Oregon district court's dismissal of a suit 
filed by environmentalists to block the sale of old-growth Douglas fir on 
federal land used as habitat by the northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the movement to split the circuit is really the product of 
the decision of one or two cases, and I don't really think it's accurate to 
portray it in that light," said Portland attorney Mark Rutzick, who argued the 
case on behalf of timber industry interests. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a perception that in environmental cases in general, that the 9th 
Circuit is too quick to issue injunctions and take the preservationist side of 
disputes, without sufficient regard for the factors on the other side," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Judge Goodwin, who has lived in Oregon most of his life, served on 
both the spotted owl panel and the 1975 panel that ruled in the Washington 
salmon fishing case. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an Oregonian, born and bred, I've lived there most of my life, and I know 
the lumber industry pretty well, and it has been hard hit by a number of 
things," Goodwin said. "But the environmental litigation is very late in the 
process, and is not really responsible for these very serious problems that 
they have up there. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a major industry that's seriously impacted by environmental 
legislation and the courts enforce the law, you're going to get dysfunctional 
feedback from political people. So I'm not blaming anybody, it's just part of 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
Splitting a circuit court is not without precedent. Five years ago, the 
sprawling 5th Circuit, which stretched from Florida across the south to Texas 
and faced many of the same criticisms now aimed at the 9th Circuit, was sliced 
roughly in half to create a new 11th circuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Gorton, a former Washington state attorney general who has fought and lost 
before the 9th Circuit, introduced legislation six years ago to split it. His 
bill advanced hardly at all, in part because it called for the unworkable 
proposition of dividing California between two circuits. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he has signed on four fellow Republicans and a Democrat as 
co-sponsors. But most agree that the bill has little chance of success without 
the support of congressmen from Hawaii and California -- most of whom have 
viewed the proposal so far with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton and U.S. Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), one of the major co-sponsors, 
say they will try to persuade their colleagues not with philosophy, but with 
common sense -- arguing that an appellate court of 28 judges is destined to 
crumble under its own weight. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that we've tried to be very up-front about is that there are 
some legitimate concerns about how the 9th Circuit operates, given its size and 
its jurisdiction, that Congress has shared long before the spotted owl," said 
Hatfield aide Jim Fitzhenry. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodwin said he believes the court can work out any differences within the 
Northwest flank, and even should that fail, he said, dividing the court will 
not solve the problem of a continually expanding caseload, particularly in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll still have the California problem," he said. "We've still got 20 
million litigious people here who like to sue each other."

ON CALIFORNIA: IT ALL COMES OUT AT THE CARWASH

<TEXT>
<P>
From time to time, California will spontaneously produce an event that seems to 
perpetuate the worst myths about life here. You can always tell when this has 
happened because the people back East will let us know. The episode pops up on 
the network news, gets sprinkled around the big newspapers. Invariably these 
stories are told in the way of a joke. 
</P>
<P>
We have one of these events playing itself out right now. In the San Fernando 
Valley, a group of citizens has nominated a Unocal gas station and carwash for 
landmark status. The outpouring of affection for these artifacts of the '50s 
was aroused when a developer announced plans to demolish both, along with a 
neighboring Tiny Naylor's, and replace them with a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
This story plugged into the California myth immediately, and it got the full 
treatment. Here was another bunch of goofy Angelenos, people who already have 
to chew their air before they breathe it, flying to the aid of car culture. The 
press conferences have been packed, and even a West German television crew 
showed up at the nominated landmark to film the cars going through the suds. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the carwash episode does, indeed, tell us something about 
California. But it has nothing to do with cars and there's little lighthearted 
about it. This is really a story about a small community pushed to the wall by 
the California boom. It's about builders and developers who have taken control 
of the neighborhoods and about the deep anger that's been left in their wake. 
And it's about revolt. 
</P>
<P>
I know these things because I happen to live in Studio City. The carwash is 
located at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards, just about half 
a mile from my house. I moved here about four years ago at the beginning of the 
boom. Let me tell you what it is like. 
</P>
<P>
Every day since I moved here I have listened to the engines of progress tear up 
the hills facing my house. This is a process known as "filling in." Builders 
find the odd-shaped lots or the very steep lots or the lots without a real 
street, then build on these lots houses that would have satisfied William 
Randolph Hearst. The castle-like affairs loom over the old houses like warlords 
and every month a new one is started. The current house is being built on a lot 
so steep it required conveyor belts to get the dirt out. 
</P>
<P>
But the real action is down on Ventura Boulevard. This particular stretch of 
Ventura, unlike some other sections, has remained a neighborly place with 
shopkeepers who know your name and operate their establishments in their own, 
occasionally eccentric, fashion. Now they are being steadily bulldozed and 
replaced with multitiered buildings all painted terra-cotta and turquoise, the 
rented spaces filled with yogurt stands and one-hour photo finishers. 
</P>
<P>
In Studio City we now have half a dozen of these places, including one with the 
baffling name of Times Square. At the entrance the owners have stationed a 
security guard who scrutinizes each car entering the parking lot to make sure 
the occupants who disembark actually shop at Times Square. A homey touch, and I 
have been gratified to observe Times Square's slow progress in filling its 
rental space. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other episodes, such as the 95-foot-tall office building that 
was constructed in a zone limited to 45-foot buildings, all with the city's 
blessing. Or the case of the order of nuns who wanted to make $9 million by 
tearing down their Catholic girls school and building condos. 
</P>
<P>
And then came Ira Smedra. Certainly his timing was bad, not to mention his 
choice of targets. Smedra announced he was about to tear down the carwash, the 
Unocal station and Tiny Naylor's so he could throw up one more mini-mall. 
Somehow, with this project, Smedra pushed Studio City beyond a threshold. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, that carwash has become something of an institution in Studio 
City. For 28 years it has functioned as the center of the biggest intersection 
in town, an outrageously ugly leftover from the days before anyone had dreamed 
up the first mini-mall. You can see your neighbors there each weekend, and 
somehow that's reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
And so the carwash became a cause here. To be sure, people of Studio City want 
to save the carwash, but they also want something more. They want to stand 
their ground, they want their turf back. 
</P>
<P>
The final outcome is still unknown, but the situation looks good before the 
city's Cultural Heritage Commission. The carwash may be a landmark yet. If the 
folks back East find that titillating, so be it. In Studio City it is enough to 
fight over, and the fight is serious.

443 INSURERS SEEK ROLLBACK EXEMPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
15 TOP SELLERS OF AUTO COVERAGE TRY TO AVOID PROP. 103-MANDATED RATE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has announced that 443 
property-casualty insurers doing business in the state, including all 15 of the 
top sellers of personal auto coverage and 14 of the top 15 sellers of 
homeowners' coverage, have filed applications to be exempted from Proposition 
103-mandated rate rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
This means that 281 of California's 724 licensed property-casualty insurers 
apparently have not filed such applications, although department officials 
cautioned Monday that most of these might not be required under the law to give 
rollbacks in any case. 
</P>
<P>
Milo Pearson, chief of rate regulation for Gillespie, estimated that as many as 
100 of the companies that did not file sell workers' compensation insurance, 
which is not affected by the rollback provisions in Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Others of those companies that did not file may be licensed to sell Proposition 
103-regulated lines of insurance but do not actually do so, Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Steven Miller, who examined the filings, said some companies 
may have filed under collective group names although he said there were some 
indications that as many as 150 companies required to file for rollbacks 
exemptions, if they were going to get any, had not done so. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie will provide a complete list of companies that have voluntarily 
agreed to give rollbacks or are required to give them by virtue of not filing 
for exemptions in a week or two, department aides said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Gillespie declared, "most applications simply asked to 
maintain current rate levels. The department has started reviewing the 
exemption applications and will be announcing public hearings or issuing 
decisions on them shortly." 
</P>
<P>
According to the recent state Supreme Court decision upholding most of 
Proposition 103, companies will be exempted from the rollback requirement if 
Gillespie finds that the rate reduction would deny them a "fair return" on 
their investment. Gillespie has indicated that in some cases she may order 
smaller rollbacks than specified under Proposition 103. The initiative provided 
for 20% cuts from rates in effect in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The only company among the top 15 sellers to voluntarily implement the 
rollbacks in either auto or homeowners insurance was USAA (United Services 
Automobile Assn.), which has announced it will cut premiums for its homeowner 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, USAA Casualty, the company's standard as compared to its 
preferred sales auto firm, was one of only three carriers among the top 15 in 
either auto or homeowners to ask Gillespie for permission to raise its rates 
above current levels. It asked for a 9.9% increase. A standard firm sells to 
riskier drivers than the preferred firm. 
</P>
<P>
Most other firms were content to try to hold to their present prices, giving no 
rollbacks but asking for no increases either. 
</P>
<P>
In order of sales, the insurers asking for exemptions from the rollbacks in 
auto insurance were State Farm Mutual, California State Auto Assn. (the 
Northern California Auto Club), Allstate, Farmers, the Automobile Club of 
Southern California, 20th Century, Mid-Century (the Farmers standard seller), 
Mercury Casualty, USAA, State Farm Fire and Casualty (the State Farm standard 
seller), GEICO, Hartford Underwriters, and Safeco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rate Increases 
</P>
<P>
USAA Casualty, one of two of the top 15 firms asking for a rate increase, is 
the 14th-largest seller. The 15th largest, Progressive Casualty, asked for a 
0.38% rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
In homeowners insurance, only All West, the 11th-biggest seller, asked for an 
increase -- 4.9%. USAA, which agreed to give the 20% rollback, is the 
6th-biggest seller of homeowners' insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Requesting exemptions from homeowners' rollbacks, in order of sales, were State 
Farm Fire and Casualty, Allstate, Farmers, California State Auto Assn., Safeco, 
Fireman's Fund, Chubb Insurance, Aetna Casualty and Surety, 20th Century, Blue 
Ridge, Prudential, West American, and Transamerica. 
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Gillespie said for the first time that she will order 
"special audits" of the rollback exemption filings "as deemed necessary," thus 
apparently acceding to calls in recent weeks from some consumers' groups for 
such detailed audits. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has promised to complete all decisions on rate rollbacks by Nov. 8.

In a speech to the Asia Society in New York City, Baker also called on the 
trading partners of the Pacific to forge a new mechanism for economic 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding China's violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators and the 
victory of hard-liners in the government, Baker sounded an upbeat note. 
</P>
<P>
"China has suffered a tragic setback but the story is not over. . . . China's 
rendezvous with freedom, like its rendezvous with the advancing nations of the 
Pacific, cannot be long delayed. We will be there to help when the day follows 
the night," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will seek to establish "the framework for a new Pacific partnership" 
during a trip next week to Japan and to Brunei, where he will meet foreign 
ministers of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year intra-Asian trade approached $200 billion . . . Yet unlike Europe, 
there are inadequate regional mechanisms to deal with the effects of 
interdependence," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the need for a new mechanism for multilateral cooperation among the 
nations of the Pacific Rim is an idea whose time has come."

THOUSANDS IN U.S. CHIP IN TO KEEP CHINESE PROTEST MOVEMENT ALIVE

Charlotte Lowery, an 80-year-old resident of Los Angeles, sat down one day 
after watching the news and scraped together $50 from her retiree's income to 
send to Chinese students at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, a group of Chinese students asked Executone Telephone Systems for 
help in setting up a telephone and computer system. The company responded by 
donating $30,000 in labor and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Meg Gresh, a mother and homemaker in Hotchkiss, Colo., 
population 800, started a network of donation sites throughout surrounding 
farming towns to help the students in China. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a rich area, but I just felt we had to do something," Gresh said. 
"It's just something that hit me strongly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Captured Imagination' 
</P>
<P>
Although more than three weeks have passed since the violent crackdown on the 
student movement in China began, the memory of the brutalities, sharpened by 
the executions of the last few days, has remained at the forefront of the 
American public's mind. Thousands of people from the United States and around 
the world have continued to respond with an outpouring of money, equipment and 
encouraging words to keep the Chinese pro-democracy movement alive outside 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"This has captured (the) imagination of people on many levels," said Gordon 
Schultz, director of a Boston-area center that Chinese students have used as 
headquarters for the last few weeks. "People are deeply moved, and they've been 
just waiting for the opportunity to help." 
</P>
<P>
Crumpled dollars bills, coins and checks for modest amounts as well as hundreds 
and even thousands of dollars have continued to flow to student groups in 
cities from Los Angeles to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen of these groups in the United States, most of them on college 
campuses, have emerged as major centers of activity and fund-raising, although 
no formal national organization has been formed. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, students at UCLA, USC and Caltech have a total of about 
$52,000 in bank accounts. Groups at each school maintain their own funds, fed 
by donations collected at rallies and mailed in unsolicited by donors. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Stanford University have taken a more sophisticated approach and 
have raised more than $80,000 with the help of advertisements in 
Chinese-language newspapers and three benefit concerts featuring traditional 
Chinese music, dance and instrumental performances. At one concert alone, the 
audience donated $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, students standing on street corners have raised about $6,000 from 
people on the street, including many non-Chinese moved by the turmoil on the 
other side of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Large companies, particularly computer firms, have donated a variety of 
services, something that would have been unheard of in the heady days of 
American student demonstrations of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe Inc., a computer networking company based in Columbus, Ohio, donated 
free computer access to students in Boston so that they could set up a news 
service for exchanging information about the democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate Corp., the Torrance-based computer software company, donated two 
copies of its $795 database program, dBase IV, to students in Boston and also 
contacted a computer consultant, who donated his services to customize the 
program for the students. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese student groups in New York have been peppered with offers of free help 
from law firms, said Xie Wen, a student leader at Columbia University. The 
group received about a dozen offers before settling on the Wall Street firm of 
Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, one of the largest firms in the country, to help 
with the relatively simple task of incorporating the student group. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't need more lawyers," Xie said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no accurate count of how much has been donated in the United States, 
but it certainly runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, an informal 
survey of the organizations showed. 
</P>
<P>
Before the military crackdown, several student groups managed to send cash, 
camping equipment and medical supplies to the students in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, it has been virtually impossible to get anything to China, or for 
that matter, to find anyone willing to accept a donation, although 
contributions have continued to flow. 
</P>
<P>
After the violence erupted in China, Alhambra High School teacher Jill Ball's 
English-as-a-second-language students each composed a poem and sent the poetry 
along with $215 they raised for a group at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the aid continues, student groups have turned their attention to 
organizing in this country and preparing for the day when they can again help 
the students in China. 
</P>
<P>
The money being raised now is intended to pay for establishing communication 
networks, documenting the history of the student movement and providing 
humanitarian aid in the future for people wounded in the Beijing massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Most student groups have been careful in separating funds that donors specify 
they want used to help people in China and those that go to pay phone bills and 
general activities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising efforts, however, have been hampered by a lack of coordination 
among groups collecting money. John Shen, an engineer in San Diego, said he 
knows of at least five groups collecting donations in his area, and he is 
uncertain about which one should receive his donation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating," he said. "It must give the Communists a good laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Student groups have been scurrying to incorporate as nonprofit organizations to 
increase their credibility and allow tax-deductible donations. But the process 
takes time, and many groups still depend on the public's good will and trust. 
For example, one group in Colorado has yet to incorporate, and checks are being 
made out to a graduate student in the physics department of the University of 
Colorado who is heading that effort. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most critical contributions have come from small groups, such as 
the Walker Center for Ecumenical Exchange in Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
In the early weeks of the demonstrations in China, the center offered the use 
of its phones to students trying to reach their homeland. It became a major 
communications center and its number was broadcast on the Voice of America in 
China for people there to call collect. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, the center's director, said he thought earlier that the telephone bill 
would come to a few thousand dollars at most. He now figures it will total 
about $30,000. So far, the center has raised only $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure what we're going to do," Schultz said. "Well, we've been late 
with our phone bill before." 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of donations have come from individuals, such as Rosemary 
Freitag of Pasadena, who were touched by what they saw on television or read in 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the horror of the whole thing," Freitag said. "I just felt so badly." 
</P>
<P>
Freitag wrote out a check for $10 clipped to a short note to students at 
Caltech: "I'm so happy to find your address and send a small contribution in 
your efforts to support the wonderful Chinese students in Beijing. I'm sorry I 
cannot send more." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Isenberg of Newton, Mass., was also moved by the plight of the Chinese 
pro-democracy activists and sent a letter to students in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make this donation in recognition of Gail Sommer's bat 
mitzvah," it said. "Would you please send her a note that this donation has 
been made in her name." 
</P>
<P>
Enclosed was a check for $25. 
</P>

Chinese authorities Monday were holding 11 Americans in Kunming on charges of 
distributing religious tracts. A U.S. official said that "we expect the matter 
to be resolved soon." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans, who went to China on June 13, were believed associated with an 
evangelical Christian group, the Latter Rain Ministry of Litchfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Adam Shub said that the charges against them were 
not considered serious under Chinese law and that an official was on his way 
from the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu to investigate.

SOVIET LAWMAKERS WILL MULL OVERHAUL OF LEGAL SYSTEM

<P>
The new Supreme Soviet, meeting for the first time Monday, approved a sweeping 
legislative agenda that would overhaul the legal system and give Soviet 
citizens more power in virtually every aspect of society. 
</P>
<P>
The deliberations were held out of earshot and sight of the Soviet public. A 
last-minute decision led to a ban on live television and radio coverage of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, disclosed by the Tass news agency, contradicted an announcement in 
the weekly central television program guide, which said that proceedings would 
be shown live. 
</P>
<P>
The two houses of the revamped Supreme Soviet, beginning its inaugural full 
session, approved a 21-point legislative program for the next six weeks that 
will consider laws affecting every sphere of life, giving citizens more say in 
areas ranging from courts and churches to trade unions and grass-roots 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The future makeup of the Soviet government also was high on the agenda as 
lawmakers faced the task of confirming or rejecting Premier Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov's handpicked Cabinet choices. Ryzhkov is scheduled to address the 
Parliament today on his proposed Cabinet, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the Soviet of the Union, one of the two houses 
of the Supreme Soviet, told lawmakers that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will 
brief a joint session of Parliament on his trips to West Germany and France 
when he returns from his Paris summit in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Previous legislatures were rubber-stamp bodies that met briefly and 
complacently "approved" nominees for the highest government posts, supplied by 
the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The political system was overhauled last year at a special party conference 
called by Gorbachev. A significant result of that landmark conference -- 
multi-candidate parliamentary balloting held earlier this year -- was preceded 
by boisterous election campaigns that captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly I. Lukyanov, first vice president of the Supreme Soviet, cautioned that 
the sweeping proposals on the legislative docket approved Monday are not 
binding in the session, scheduled to run until Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Lukyanov "noted that putting draft laws on the agenda does not mean that all of 
them should be endorsed at the current session," Tass said. "This only means 
that the discussion of certain draft laws has started." 
</P>
<P>
But the scope of the proposed legislation was stunning. 
</P>
<P>
Draft laws placed on the agenda significantly extend such basic rights as the 
freedom of assembly, conscience and self-government. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the laws would give more rights to workers, consumers and inventors. 
Others prescribe massive overhauls of the Soviet criminal and tax codes.

CANADA EXTRADITES CALIFORNIA MURDER SUSPECT FEATURED ON TV 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man arrested near Vancouver, Canada, after he was featured on a U.S. 
television show about unsolved crimes has been sent back to California to face 
two murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Blanusa, 37, faces two counts of murder and two of kidnaping in the 1986 
killing of brothers Gilbert and Joe Flores in Modesto. Police in the San 
Joaquin Valley city said the brothers were shot after being suspected of 
robbing a house. 
</P>
<P>
Blanusa, flanked by Vancouver police, was turned over to American police on 
Friday after a Canadian judge ruled that Blanusa should be extradited. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1976 extradition treaty, Canada has the discretion to refuse to 
extradite someone unless the United States promises not to seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Halprin, a federal Justice Department lawyer, said Canadian officials did 
not ask American authorities for that assurance in Blanusa's case. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Blanusa was living in Burnaby, a Vancouver suburb, under the name 
Bob Davies when he was featured on the program "America's Most Wanted." Less 
than 24 hours after the program was shown, police stopped a car in Burnaby and 
arrested Blanusa. He was working for a Burnaby scaffolding company and his 
Canadian common-law wife said she knew nothing of his past.

PENSION INVESTMENT BILL TARGETS NORTHERN IRELAND

<P>
An alliance of some of the Assembly's most liberal and conservative members got 
together Monday to approve legislation that would guide California's pension 
fund investments away from companies with operations that practice religious or 
ethnic discrimination in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), was approved on a 
bipartisan 42-20 vote and sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would require the Public Employees Retirement System and the State 
Teachers Retirement System to determine whether corporations in which they 
invest practice "non-discrimination" in employment and "freedom of workplace" 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The governing boards of the two pension funds would have to compile a list each 
year of the corporations doing business in Northern Ireland and then evaluate 
whether the firms had taken "substantial action" toward complying with the 
so-called MacBride Principles. 
</P>
<P>
The principles, named for Amnesty International co-founder Sean MacBride, call 
for affirmative action to bring under-represented religious minorities into the 
workplace and train them for advancement. The principles also advocate the 
abolishment of practices that reserve job openings for applicants from certain 
religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
Burton said the bill addresses the "tremendous discrimination" in Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"What this does is use the leverage of our vast retirement funds to encourage 
investment in businesses that follow fair employment practices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, one of the Assembly's most liberal members, was joined by Assemblyman 
Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), one of the lower house's most conservative members. 
Nolan said the legislation would repair some of the damage done by "centuries 
of conflict" in that country. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense for our retirement system to invest in an unstable, 
politically volatile economy," said Nolan, who embraced Burton after the vote. 
"This bill will help stabilize the economy, help bring fairness to employment 
there and . . . encourage them to bring about responsibility and stability."

ASSEMBLY URGES PENALTIES FOR FLAG BURNING

<P>
Reacting to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Assembly approved a resolution 
Monday calling for a constitutional amendment authorizing criminal penalties 
for the burning or desecration of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly voted 58 to 2 for the resolution, authored by Republican Tim 
Leslie of Carmichael, who clutched a flag presented to his family at the 
funeral of his father, an Army officer who died in North Africa during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
"My father died for this country," Leslie said. "He died for this flag. He died 
for the freedom and liberty that it represents." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's resolution -- which will be sent to Congress as an advisory measure, 
if approved by the state Senate -- prompted more than half an hour of debate on 
a day when the Assembly, with legislative deadlines looming, was considering 
more than 200 bills. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for President Bush said the President supports 
legislation to restore criminal penalties for flag-desecration, but hasn't 
decided whether to back a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't undertaken a kind of legal analysis that would yield some 
definitive action," said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in Tuesday's editions of the New York Times, Bush 
said: "I think I've sublimated some of the passion I feel, and I'm very 
open-minded as to what to do about it. And I've asked our attorney general 
(Dick Thornburgh) and chief of staff (John H. Sununu) to recommend what to do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles), one of the two members to vote 
against the California bill, said he was a "flag monitor" in school as a child 
and later was "sickened" when those who shared his opposition to the Vietnam 
War burned flags. But he said he supports the right to burn the flag, affirmed 
by the Supreme Court in its decision last week. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said the flag stands for "freedom of thought, the freedom of speech 
that we have in this country that very few people anywhere in the world are 
able to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
But Friedman and Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) were far outnumbered 
by lawmakers who rose to register what they described as "outrage" and 
"disgust" over the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Eric Seastrand (R-Salinas) accused the resolution's opponents of 
using "mental gymnastics" to come up with arguments to protect the rights of 
flag-burners.

Cambridge, Mass., became the first city in the nation to approve an ordinance 
protecting the welfare of vertebrates used in experiments. City council members 
voted 8 to 0 to expand on federal and state regulations concerning humane 
treatment of laboratory animals by including all vertebrates -- animals with 
backbones or spinal columns. Federal law deals with dogs, cats and monkeys to 
the exclusion of reptiles, amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits, said Steven 
Wise, an animal rights attorney. The ordinance will affect Harvard University, 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 11 other academic and private firms 
engaged in animal research. The council created a commissioner's post to 
oversee and enforce the new rules.

A Muslim clergyman said on Iranian television that he had spied for the United 
States, supplying information about factional divisions among his country's 
ruling clerics. Heshmatollah Maqsoodi, 58, said that on a trip to the United 
States last year, he also had a 30-minute meeting with Reza Pahlavi, son of the 
late Shah of Iran who was toppled by the Islamic revolution 10 years ago. 
Maqsoodi, who is also an attorney, said he made his first contact with the CIA 
last year when he applied for a visa at a U.S. consulate in West Germany. The 
arrest of Maqsoodi and others accused of working for the CIA was announced in 
April.

A former research technician has been confirmed as suffering from a rare herpes 
virus believed responsible for the death of a co-worker last week, authorities 
said. A man who was formerly employed by International Research Development 
Corp. in Mattawan, Mich., was admitted Wednesday to Bronson Methodist Hospital 
for observation after the death of a research technician who had been bitten by 
a laboratory monkey. His condition has worsened from fair to serious. A 
hospital spokeswoman said he has contracted the Herpes B virus often carried by 
Old World macaque and rhesus monkeys such as those used at IRDC.

Denying that he is "the cold-blooded, inhumane monster some people believe me 
to be," John Galen Davenport was sentenced to death for the second time in the 
murder of a Tustin woman found impaled on a wooden stake. Davenport's original 
sentence was reversed by the state Supreme Court under then-Chief Justice Rose 
Elizabeth Bird. On March 27, 1980, Gayle Ann Lingle, 30, was stabbed repeatedly 
and impaled on a stake while she was still alive. Her nude body was found in a 
field in Irvine. "I cannot imagine a more horrible way for a person to die," 
Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey said in pronouncing sentence on 
Davenport's 34th birthday. Davenport's girlfriend, Judy Dunn, said that in one 
way, it was the present he wanted most -- "He's anxious to get back to San 
Quentin and out of the Orange County Jail."

2ND MEASLES SHOT URGED

Responding to a nationwide measles outbreak, the American Academy of Pediatrics 
has decided that all middle-school-age children should receive a second measles 
shot. The decision was a change in position for the prestigious medical group, 
said Dr. Milton Schwarz, president of the Orange County chapter. Twenty-four 
states, including California, have reported 5,569 cases this year, a 300% 
increase over the same period last year, the National Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta said. Among the hardest hit have been children in the Los 
Angeles area, where eight have died from complications. The academy recommends 
that all children receive a booster "MMR" shot for measles, mumps and rubella 
as they enter junior high. The academy also recommended that anyone born after 
1957 be re-vaccinated.

President Bush plans to announce this week a broad package of proposals aimed 
at changing the way federal campaigns are financed and limiting the advantages 
enjoyed by incumbents, the Washington Post reported. The Bush proposals are 
expected to include new limits on political action committee contributions, a 
ban on the retention of excess campaign funds for use in the next election and 
tighter limits on free congressional mailings to constituents. Administration 
officials said Bush is meeting the next three days with a variety of groups 
interested in campaign finance reform before he makes final decisions on the 
package. Officials said most of the options he is considering would tend to put 
limits on incumbents, a pattern that would help Republicans since Democrats 
control both houses of Congress.

More than 700 Cambodians who fled oppressive conditions and shelling in Khmer 
Rouge camps will be returned to Khmer Rouge control under an agreement reached 
with Thai officials and non-Communist Cambodians, the New York Times reported, 
quoting Western diplomats and aid officials in Bangkok. One aid official said 
the leaders of the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, who 
operate the camp to which the refugees fled, are afraid of their coalition 
partners, the Communist Khmer Rouge. The 700 refugees represent one of the 
largest defections from Khmer Rouge control in the last 10 years.

NICARAGUA OPPOSITION PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen Nicaraguan opposition parties announced that they have agreed to 
present joint candidates and a single program to run against the ruling 
Sandinista Front in elections next February. The decision was a breakthrough 
for the Opposition National Union, a loose coalition of 14 parties ranging from 
left to right. "The parties have agreed to accept a united program for a 
government of national salvation and joint candidates for president, vice 
president, legislators and mayors," Luis Sanchez Sancho of the Socialist Party 
told a news conference attended by the leaders of all opposition parties. 
Opinion polls have indicated that the opposition stands little chance of 
beating the Sandinistas in the elections unless it unites behind joint 
candidates.

CONTAMINATED LAND MAY BE SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite extensive contamination of the land, the Los Angeles Board of Education 
on Monday authorized district officials to study a proposal to build a new high 
school on the site of the former Franciscan Ceramics manufacturing plant in 
Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say they are so desperate for land for new schools that even 
a hazardous site is worth considering. 
</P>
<P>
Over decades, the 45-acre Franciscan site was contaminated by dumping lead, 
zinc and other toxic materials from manufacturing ceramics. The problem was 
compounded in December, when large concentrations of cancer-causing asbestos 
were found. The asbestos deposits, which allegedly resulted from illegal 
demolition of buildings, were immediately covered with plastic sheeting and do 
not pose a threat to the neighborhood, according to state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Considered 
</P>
<P>
The Atwater site -- which would be made safe before any construction -- is one 
of several "unusual new-wave locations" being considered by the school board, 
said Robert J. Niccum, district director of real estate. The parcel is believed 
to be the first known contaminated site to be considered for a school in the 
nation, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Department of Health Services said last week that a 
proposed cleanup plan would make the site safe for any use, including a school. 
</P>
<P>
"These days we are finding that almost any site we are considering is unusual 
in one way or another," said Niccum, who explained that the district in recent 
years has faced growing opposition from homeowners and apartment dwellers who 
have successfully fought efforts to buy large numbers of homes for new school 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last three or four years, we have had to change our thinking from 
looking at areas that are primarily residential to commercial and industrial 
properties," Niccum said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the district is considering purchasing an ironworks in South Gate 
in order to build a school on adjacent property, Niccum said. A school could 
not otherwise be built at the site because the ironworks causes excessive air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The district also is considering purchasing for school construction the 
now-closed Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard, a bus repair and maintenance 
facility owned by the Rapid Transit District in South-Central Los Angeles and a 
storage yard owned by the Department of Water and Power, also in the 
South-Central area. 
</P>
<P>
Niccum said acquisition of the Franciscan property would be preferable to 
condemning hundreds of homes in some other area in order to obtain the amount 
of land needed to build a high school. 
</P>
<P>
"We have looked at alternative high school sites for at least five years," he 
said. "Virtually all of those sites involved somewhere in the order 200 or 300 
homes. There is no way that we can put together the amount of land that we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
School officials are seeking the Franciscan site to relieve overcrowding at 
Belmont High School near downtown, considered one of the most crowded schools 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's board action initiates an environmental study of the Franciscan 
property as a potential school site. Board member Rita Walters voiced the only 
opposition, saying that the site, which borders on Glendale, is too far away 
from the large student population, mainly in the mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
However, Board Member Jackie Goldberg said that if contamination of the site 
can be corrected, the vacant property would be ideal because it would give the 
district one of its largest high school campuses without displacing families. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a better solution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Niccum said the district could complete a preliminary feasibility study on the 
Franciscan site within five months, about the time the contamination cleanup is 
expected to be completed by the property owner, the Schurgin Development Corp. 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Schurgin, a leading developer of shopping centers, purchased the land in 
November and plans to build a $110-million shopping arcade with about 30 
stores, including a major home improvement center, supermarket, restaurants, 
retail outlets and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Schurgin on Monday told the board they are not happy with the 
district's proposal. Dale J. Goldsmith, an attorney representing Schurgin, said 
the developer expects to spend more than $15 million to clean up the property 
and already has more than $50 million invested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who go to that extent are not going to welcome a public agency 
with open arms," Niccum said. "But we would expect to pay the full market 
price, including the cost of the cleanup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Franciscan factory has sat vacant for more than five years. Dilapidated and 
partly dismantled buildings on the property are surrounded by a chain-link 
fence posted with warning signs and patrolled by 24-hour security guards.

TOP MANAGERS OF L.A. SCHOOLS GET PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
A divided Los Angeles Board of Education narrowly approved hefty salary raises 
for administrators late Monday, despite complaints from teachers and some state 
legislators that district managers already are overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 3 to give top management a 16% raise over two years. The 
vote was 7 to 0 in favor of giving middle management, such as principals, a 24% 
increase over three years -- the same raise teachers won after a nine-day 
strike in May. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the board formally ratified a new teachers' contract, which 
provides a 24% three-year salary raise and a larger role for teachers in making 
decisions on how schools should be run. 
</P>
<P>
As of late Monday the board had approved cuts totaling $43 million, although it 
had not yet voted on a tentative $3.8-billion budget for 1989-90. This year's 
budget was $3.5 billion. A final budget vote is expected in August. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the cuts were needed to pay for employee raises. They 
included sizable reductions in central office operations, per-pupil allotments 
of lottery money to schools and "combat pay" to administrators on inner-city 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Cuts Possible 
</P>
<P>
The board may make additional cuts if it decides to add or expand programs, 
such as a new $6.5-million plan for raising student achievement across the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts were made despite the fact that the district expects to receive about 
$75 million from the state as a result of Proposition 98, the voter-approved 
initiative that guarantees schools at least 40% of the state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
Voting for the 16% top management raise were Leticia Quezada, Rita Walters, 
Alan Gershman and board President Roberta Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada said that holding back the raise for 98 top managers would save only 
$100,000. "We'd save that at the expense of the morale of some hard-working 
individuals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But board member Jackie Goldberg countered: "Can you continue to have the gap 
between the person in the classroom and the person in the superintendent's 
chair grow? I just don't think that's a good practice." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, Warren Furutani and Julie Korenstein voted against the raise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freeze Rejected 
</P>
<P>
A motion by Korenstein that called for freezing all administrator salaries 
above $125,000 and giving all administrators a flat $6,000 increase this year 
failed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the top management raises are Supt. Leonard Britton, whose $141,000 
annual salary will increase to $164,000 in the fiscal year starting July 1, and 
the two deputy superintendents, Sidney Thompson and William Anton, whose 
$125,000 annual salaries will increase to $145,800 next year. 
</P>
<P>
The management raises had angered a group of Los Angeles-area Assembly members, 
who urged the board to hold off on approving the raises until after a new board 
member, Mark Slavkin, takes office next month, and threatened to conduct a 
special investigation into district salaries if the increases were approved. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in support of the administrator raises Monday night, Ray Tolcacher, 
president of the Assn. of California School Administrators, said that Los 
Angeles district administrators are not overpaid when compared to the 20 
largest districts statewide. He also said the increases take into account the 
extraordinary difficulties administrators, particularly those based in schools, 
faced during the last year of teacher unrest that culminated in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The new teachers' contract will increase the average teacher's salary from 
$35,000 this year to $42,460 in the fiscal year beginning July 1. In 1990, the 
average teacher salary will increase to $45,700.

"Batman" may have enjoyed a boffo opening at the box office, but there was at 
least one dissenter in West Hollywood. The joker sprayed a logo of the caped 
crusader, with a line slashing through the middle, on a Melrose Boulevard 
sidewalk.

Now begins the third annual search for the nation's biggest sports nut. 
</P>
<P>
It's sponsored by Fisher Nuts, of course. No Southern Californian has won yet, 
but Mike Zimmerman of Temple City finished in the top six in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman's most impressive performances, according to Fisher: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Proposed to wife in bed during Mets-Phillies game." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Changed into wedding tux at Willie Mays' old locker." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Marched toward Candlestick Park's home plate to the tune of 'Take Me Out 
to the Ballgame.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Married wife Beverly in the batting cage." 
</P>
<P>
Only in West L.A. (a subdivision of this column): When Loews' luxury Santa 
Monica Beach Hotel held its opening ceremonies the other day, the guests 
included a nutritionist who lectured on the difference between "good and bad

People seem willing to spend more than ever these days on pet care -- both 
temporal and eternal. 
</P>
<P>
D &amp; D Inc. of Vernon, an animal disposal service, says an increasing number 
of owners are opting for a unique service. 
</P>
<P>
For a charge of between $50 and $100, depending on the size of the animal, D 
&amp; D will cremate a pet and then deliver the ashes to the owner's home in a 
metal tin, via United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
"We use UPS because it's more economical for us and for the pet owner," said 
general manager Bill Gorman. "We serve such a wide area it would be too 
expensive for us to try to deliver them personally to each home." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said that "UPS was kind of apprehensive at first about handling pet 
remains. But they've been very good. We've had only one mis-delivery in five 
years."

The late state Assembly Speaker and state treasurer has been honored by USC, 
which is renaming its Institute of Politics and Government in honor of Jesse 
Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the 250-pound-plus Unruh was seen as something of a radical during 
his student days at USC because of his liberal views. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the most successful political figure to graduate from USC," said 
political consultant Joe Cerrell. "Not bad for a guy who once told me that he 
was so poor growing up that he couldn't go to grade school every day because he 
had to share his overalls and shoes with the other children in the family."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SPRAYING FOR ORIENTAL FRUIT FLIES TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County agricultural workers today will begin applying insecticide to a 
15-square-mile area in the South Bay, after the discovery last week of two 
Oriental fruit flies, one in Hawthorne and the other in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit fly, which is considered a potential threat to agriculture, was 
successfully eradicated by the same measures last year after being detected in 
four parts of the county, said E. Leon Spaugy, Los Angeles County's 
agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Workers will be applying a sex lure, methyl eugenol, with an insecticide, 
Naled, to utility poles and trees. Boundaries for the eradication effort are 
Artesia Boulevard on the south, Western Avenue on the east, Imperial Highway on 
the north and Aviation Boulevard on the west. 
</P>
<P>
Additional traps have been placed and will be inspected daily to determine how 
widespread the infestation might be, Spaugy said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-ART DEALER GETS PRISON FOR SMUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Santa Barbara art dealer was sentenced in Los Angeles to six months in 
prison Monday for smuggling pre-Columbian artifacts into the United States from 
Peru. 
</P>
<P>
David R. Swetnam, 31, who now lives in Healdsburg in Sonoma County, admitted in 
May that he engaged in illegal smuggling by failing to properly declare the 
jewelry, ceramic vases and miniature stone mortars as artifacts in papers 
submitted to U.S. Customs officials. 
</P>
<P>
Swetnam, who previously ran a gallery and art restoration business in Santa 
Barbara, pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving and causing the 
importation of smuggled goods in 1986 and 1987.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BROKER FINED $6,000 IN CAMPAIGN SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sherman Oaks insurance broker was fined $6,000 Monday for allegedly helping 
pro-Israeli activist Michael R. Goland launder campaign contributions in an 
attempt to influence the outcome of the 1986 California Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
Michael B. Altman, 43, who admitted acting as an intermediary for money from 
Goland that secretly financed a commercial for a third-party candidate, was 
also placed on two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Goland and two other confederates are on trial on election fraud charges 
stemming from Goland's effort to divert support away from Republican nominee Ed 
Zschau, whom he considered a lukewarm supporter of Israel. Only days before the 
election, Goland financed a television commercial for American Independent 
Party candidate Edward Vallen, using Altman as an intermediary for the funds.

Goland claims he was running a legal independent expenditure campaign, but 
prosecutors say he was illegally attempting to hide the source of the financing 
by channeling it through Altman and several subsequent straw donors whom he 
allegedly reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Altman pleaded guilty in January to a misdemeanor count of aiding the making of 
a campaign contribution in the name of another.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORCED ENTRY FOUND IN HOME; TWO SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators found signs of forced entry to a Pomona home where an elderly man 
and his sister were found bludgeoned to death, but the motive and killer 
remained unknown, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There were signs of entry at a bathroom window, said Sgt. Gary Elofson. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Henry Miller, 88, and Nina Reynolds, 81, were found Sunday 
morning by family members. Each victim was on the floor of their bedroom. 
Elofson said autopsies had yet to be performed and the time of death was not 
known. Investigators did not know what kind of weapon was used. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives were asked to begin an inventory of the home to determine if anything 
was stolen.

Belgium had 474 reported cases of AIDS by the end of March, 1989, up 40% from 
the same time last year, the Health Ministry said Monday. A ministry statement 
said almost 30% of acquired immune deficiency syndrome sufferers caught the 
disease through heterosexual contact, a figure it said was one of the highest 
in Europe.

ECHOES FROM SATURN'S LARGEST MOON; 
</P>
<P>
RADAR IMAGES TELL OF DISTANT ETHANE OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is so far away that takes light 2 1/2 hours to 
travel there and back, but scientists have managed to bounce a radar beam from 
California off its surface and capture its echo in New Mexico to learn more 
about a moon that lies hidden beneath a dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
What they learned is that Titan has an ocean of liquid ethane, which many 
scientists had expected because of the chemical composition of its atmosphere. 
But they also learned it is not entirely covered by the ocean, which few 
scientists had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"The radar echo from Titan is the weakest such echo that has ever been 
measured, yet we were able to obtain a great deal of information," Duane O. 
Muhleman, a Caltech planetary scientist, said in announcing the finding Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The echo was weak, but it varied considerably, indicating that Titan has an 
ocean with beaches and maybe even mountains, though hardly the type to lure 
tourists. The beaches may well be ice, since the surface temperature is 290 
degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surface Composition 
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable to assume that the solid surface is made up of water ice, and 
perhaps solid carbon dioxide, silicates and tars," Muhleman said. "If the 
surface can support hills and mountains, they could stand above the liquid 
hydrocarbons and the surface may resemble oceans and continents, but this is 
pure speculation. Our experiment was designed to narrow the range of 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists for years have used radar to study distant bodies, because the 
strength of the echo tells them much about the texture of the surface. It also 
penetrates clouds, thus offering a glimpse at what lies below. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Titan, that process was carried to new limits. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists used a 230-foot antenna at Goldstone, in California's Mojave 
Desert, to transmit a 360,000-watt signal for three 5 1/2-hour sessions on June 
3, 4 and 5. The antenna is part of the Deep Space Network that the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration uses to track spacecraft speeding through 
the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
After traveling 2 1/2 hours to Titan and back, the signal -- traveling at the 
speed of light -- was received at the Very Large Array, a huge radio telescope 
consisting of 27 large antennas near Socorro, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roughness Measured 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the echo depends on the electrical reflectivity and the 
roughness of the surface of the target. A deep ethane ocean would have very low 
reflectivity, which is exactly what the scientists found most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
But on June 4 an echo was received that was far too strong to have been 
reflected by an ocean, indicating it came instead from a highly reflective 
surface and was similar to echoes from Venus. On two other occasions the signal 
was much weaker than normal, suggesting the surface of Titan is very irregular. 
</P>
<P>
Since Titan rotates about 23 degrees per day, the scientists concluded that it 
was presenting different faces to Earth, and those faces were quite variable. 
</P>
<P>
The full portrait of Titan, which has nearly twice the mass of Earth's moon, 
will have to wait awhile. NASA hopes to eventually send an unmanned probe to 
Saturn and its moons, but that proposal is still in the design stage. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Muhleman in the Titan radar project were Martin Slade, a planetary 
scientist at JPL, and Caltech graduate students Arie Grossman and Bryan Butler.

JIM MURRAY: ANOTHER BLOB STORY NOT TO BE BELIEVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the things that constantly amazes me about life is the way 
misconceptions go ringing down the corridors of time from gossip to gossip till 
they assume the identity of reality, of gospel. 
</P>
<P>
They're harder to shake than a poor relative. Pity the poor sucker who gets 
stuck with one of them. He wears it for life like a tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
I call them blobs. They have a life of their own. They grow even if you try to 
cut off their heads. They're ineradicable. 
</P>
<P>
The late, great race writer, Joe Palmer, once said: "The next best thing to a 
lie is the truth nobody will believe." Well, the next best thing to the truth 
is a lie everybody believes. 
</P>
<P>
I ran into this one particular blob some time ago. It was at a cocktail party. 
Some over-served devotee undertook to share his baseball wisdom with me. "It's 
well known that the Dodgers ruined Fernando Valenzuela by overworking him on 
the mound," he began. 
</P>
<P>
Since this guy didn't know the infield-fly rule from an insecticide, I let the 
remark pass. That's dangerous to do with blobs. The next thing you know, 
they've covered the country. 
</P>
<P>
Some people don't really want to know. They prefer their certitudes, no matter 
how shakily based. But the truth of the matter is, Fernando Valenzuela was no 
more overused than any other good pitcher in the history of the game. And he 
was used a good deal less than many of them. 
</P>
<P>
Let us compare, for instance, Fernando's statistics with those of a Dodger 
pitcher of a generation ago, another star of the staff, Don Drysdale, in their 
comparative heydays. We get the following chart (games, innings pitched, games 
started, complete games):

Who was overworked? 
</P>
<P>
If you want to go back in time, you will find that the great Walter Johnson 
pitched the following inning-totals in his best years: 373, 368, 371 2/3, 371, 
346. He pitched 277 innings when he was an old man. 
</P>
<P>
How about Grover Cleveland Alexander? He led the league in innings pitched 
seven times with totals of 367, 310 1/3, 355, 376 1/3, 388 2/3, 381 2/3 and 363 
1/3. He lasted 20 years -- with time out for war -- and won 373 games, some of 
them sober. He started 45 games in 1916, completed 38 and won 33. And probably 
never soaked his arm in ice or ultra-sonic baths. 
</P>
<P>
The immortal Cy Young, who won 511 games, pitched 453 innings one season. 
</P>
<P>
You want someone more contemporary? 
</P>
<P>
How about Tom Terrific? Tom Seaver in his salad years with the Mets pitched 291 
innings in 1970, 290 innings in 1973 and 280 in '75. Ferguson Jenkins had years 
of 328 innings, 325, 313, 311 and 308. 
</P>
<P>
It is claimed that a screwball, Valenzuela's money pitch, is hard on the arm. 
Well, Carl Hubbell who practically invented the pitch, used to pitch so often 
he was nicknamed the Meal Ticket. He had innings pitched totals of 308 2/3, 
313, 302 and 304 in his great years. He lasted 16, even though his left arm 
looked like something you could open wine with. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to overwork a young pitcher. Dizzy Dean was always held up as the 
classic example of the overused star. He pitched in 50 or more games three 
years in a row -- and had seasons of 324 1/3, 315, and 311 innings -- but the 
telltale stat here is, Dizzy would start in, like 34 or 36 games, but pitch in 
50 or more. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936, for instance, Diz started 34 games but pitched in 51. This meant that 
he had to warm up and pitch in relief 17 times between starts. Now that, you 
have to say, is overwork. But you will notice in the above charts that Fernando 
started every game he pitched in and had no appearances between starts. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that Fernando's troubles stemmed from overwork is a blob. This won't 
kill it. Blobs are like nuclear waste. You can't get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
You just don't have to believe them.

shoveled the ball through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on the sidelines, a small group of mostly middle-aged women cheered 
noisily, spurred on by one who was kicking, jumping and dancing about like a 
college cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
A pudgy, gray-haired fellow took the inbounds pass, dribbled a few steps and 
started directing traffic for a couple of other gray-haired guys with more than 
ample midriffs. One skinny guy, so thin he looked as if he might break if 
someone bumped him, took an overhead pass and drove for the basket with 
unexpected verve for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
But the big guy was on top of him, slapping the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are these guys?" asked a puzzled onlooker, attracted by the rhythmic 
clapping of the women and a few other kibitzers inside the Carmel High School 
gym. It was apparent these weren't weekend gym rats running up and down the 
court in a playground game of shirts and skins on a Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
They were too old, all in their early 50s, too slow -- and too disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
"The big guy's Imhoff, the skinny guy's Dalton and the guy running things is 
Fitzpatrick," said a knowledgeable sideliner with his arm in a sling. "That's 
Buch taking the ball now and McClintock's the bald guy in the middle looking 
for a pass." 
</P>
<P>
It was the University of California's 1959 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championship basketball team running the plays just the way Coach Pete Newell 
taught them 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are the guys without the shirts?" the onlooker asked. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the same ones the varsity ran their plays against in practice in '59." 
</P>
<P>
The 30th reunion of the Cal team, a traditional gathering every five years, is 
not only for the varsity. It's for the entire squad, from Al Buch, the captain, 
down to George Hill, the student manager. 
</P>
<P>
There are Tandy Gillis, Bernie Simpson and Jerry Mann, the first-line reserves. 
Ned Averbuck, the guy with the flowing white hair who looks like someone out of 
a Dickens novel, played in only two games. Dave Stafford, Bobby Wendell and 
Stan Morrison played only a few more. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the men on the court, Bill Alexander, Ed Donahue and Jim (Butenschoen) 
Barrons, didn't play a single minute during the Bears' 29-game schedule, but 
they are here for the reunion. Donahue came all the way from Missoula, Mont., 
to rejoin his old teammates for one more fling at the game that brought them 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The man wearing the sling is one of them, too. He is Jim Langley, a reserve 
forward who later became head golf professional at the Cypress Point Club, 
perhaps the most prestigious links in the country. His right arm was severely 
injured in an automobile accident 18 months ago, or he would be in the 
scrimmage, too. 
</P>
<P>
The cheerleader is Louetta Joy Langley, Jim's wife. She was one of the pompon 
girls when the Bears won the NCAA championship at Louisville by beating Oscar 
Robertson and Cincinnati, then Jerry West and West Virginia on successive 
nights. She has the women -- wives and friends of the aging performers -- 
cheering as if it were the NCAA final again. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches, Newell, Rene Herrerias and Rupe Ricksen, are here, too. 
</P>
<P>
So is Joe Kapp, an honorary member of the '59 team. He played with Buch and 
Dalton and Langley for two years but didn't play his senior year because he was 
quarterback on the Bears' Rose Bowl team and decided against reporting late. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Straw Hat band is missing. And three lettermen, reserves Jack Grout, 
Dick Doughty and Earl Schultz, whose businesses prevented them from the weekend 
hospitality at Carmel's Quail Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
There has already been a moment of silence for two others. Florence Newell, 
Pete's wife and the team's den mother, and Jack Williamson, the team trainer, 
have died since the last reunion. 
</P>
<P>
The scrimmage continues. 
</P>
<P>
"You watch 'em, they'll keep running to position like they did 30 years ago," 
Newell says proudly. "Players like we had on that team never forget. That's why 
they were so good." 
</P>
<P>
Al Buch, darkly handsome with flecks of gray in his curly black hair, makes an 
eye-popping wraparound pass to Bobby Dalton, who bounces the ball to Denny 
Fitzpatrick for an easy layup. Three self-made millionaires reliving their 
youth in a high school gym with old cronies. 
</P>
<P>
Darrall Imhoff tries a hook shot. Clank. Bill McClintock takes the rebound and 
shoots from close-in. Clank. Now it's Buch's turn from the free-throw line. 
Clank. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys don't shoot very well, do they?" someone asks. 
</P>
<P>
They never did. Except when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
Buch was only a 35% shooter, but he scored 18 -- his season high -- against 
Cincinnati in the NCAA semifinals. He got 10 of them in the final five minutes 
to beat the Big O and the Bearcats, 64-58. And in a 60-58 victory over UCLA, it 
was Buch's jump shot with four seconds remaining that beat Coach John Wooden's 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Only Fitzpatrick was among the top 10 scorers in the Pacific Coast Conference 
as the team ranked fourth in scoring among nine teams. 
</P>
<P>
Author Craig Kubey, who was working on a book called "Cinderella '59," called 
them "the least talented team ever to win a major national championship." 
</P>
<P>
No one on the team will dispute the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We won not because we had the best players, but because we had the best team, 
and I mean that in the fullest sense of the word," said Fitzpatrick, the team's 
most valuable player. "Pete (Coach Newell) had a role for each of us and we ran 
the assignments over and over until we could run them blindfolded. Everyone, 
the junior varsity players included, had his role. We executed, but we worked 
as a unit. We had no stars." 
</P>
<P>
The stars of college basketball in 1959 were Robertson, the leading scorer in 
the country with a 32.6 point average, and West, who helped make West Virginia 
the highest-scoring team in the country with 85.3 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton &amp; Co., whose strong suit was guile and Newell's pressing defense, 
shut them both down. 
</P>
<P>
When the teams stepped onto the floor at Freedom Hall for the semifinal game, 
Dalton, a 6-foot-3, 150-pound forward from San Leandro, walked up to the 
powerfully built 6-5 Robertson and said, "My name's Dalton, what's yours?" 
</P>
<P>
Then, with help from Grout, he proceeded to hold the Big O to 19 points, but 
most significantly, only one field goal in the second half, when Cal rallied 
from a 36-29 deficit to win. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, when Robertson was on the Olympic team in Rome, his coach was 
Newell. One day after practice, Robertson asked, "Did that skinny forward of 
yours really not know who I was?" 
</P>
<P>
Newell, recalling the incident, said he just smiled. 
</P>
<P>
West got his 28 points in the final game, but the Bears held the Mountaineers 
15 points below their average and held on for a 71-70 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff made what turned out to be the winning basket with 17 seconds to play 
when he missed an awkward hook shot but rebounded his own shot and banked a 
second effort into the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
"If Darrall didn't get his rebound and West Virginia got the ball, it would 
have been the end for us," Newell said. "We all knew West would score if he got 
his hands on the ball. It was a great play by Darrall." 
</P>
<P>
West still can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think you should have beaten us then, and I still don't," West said 
recently at a testimonial dinner for Newell. "I never will." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Coach Bobby Knight, the keynote speaker, pointed to Newell and said to 
West: "That guy sitting right over there is why you didn't win that night. Pete 
Newell knows more about this game, at both ends of the court, than anyone I've 
ever known." 
</P>
<P>
One of Newell's most significant moves was to get Herrerias, a 5-9 former 
University of San Francisco player who helped him win the National Invitation 
Tournament in 1949, as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Rene did such a great job of scouting that sometimes we knew how to run 
opponents' plays better than they did," Buch said. "There were times when a 
team had the ball and we'd get to the place they were supposed to be ahead of 
them. Once in a while, if they didn't run to the right spot, we'd yell, 'Hey, 
you're supposed to be over here.' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can credit Rene enough for his scouting reports. And he 
taught the junior varsity guys exactly how to run them so we would be 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Who were these guys, and where did they come from? 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff, who runs a pay-phone franchise in Oregon after spending 12 years in the 
National Basketball Assn., including four with the Lakers, was a baby-faced, 
6-10, 205-pound center from Alhambra. He was so little thought of that his high 
school coach, Bob Boyd, didn't even recommend him to USC, his alma mater. 
Imhoff got his only recruiting call from Orange Coast, a junior college. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play much my senior year at Alhambra because I broke my elbow chasing 
(baseball star) Steve Kemp through the locker room," Imhoff recalled. "But 
Boyd's never lived down the fact he wouldn't recommend me to Twogie (Coach 
Forrest Twogood)." 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff got to Cal only because he wanted to study forestry and he had an aunt 
living in Berkeley who called the basketball office, trying to find a room with 
a bed big enough for her nephew. When Newell heard her say, "He's 6-8 and still 
growing," he found him a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
A story in the Daily Californian student newspaper in the fall of 1958 served 
as an incentive for Imhoff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It said Cal would have a fairly good team, but there was a real question at 
center with Morrison, Doughty and Imhoff. I think we all had something to prove 
after that and with Newell's guidance, we did it." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who missed most of the season with mononucleosis, remembers an 
incident he believes made the team a potential champion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a preseason practice and Darrall blocked a driving layup by Bob 
Dalton," Morrison recalled. "That was the day Imhoff became a player and the 
team took off from there." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who coached seven years at USC, recently resigned as athletic 
director at UC Santa Barbara to become basketball coach at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've played for a man like Pete Newell, you've learned so much about 
coaching and teaching and living that you feel you have to pass it on," 
Morrison said. "At least that's the way I feel. That's why I'm going back into 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff, named the Bears' most improved player in 1959, became an All-American 
center the next season when Cal again went to the NCAA final before losing to 
an Ohio State team led by Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek. Later, Imhoff played 
on the Olympic gold-medal team in 1960 with Robertson, West and Lucas before 
becoming a pro. 
</P>
<P>
The big, good-natured Imhoff is the target of much needling among his old 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Imhoff calls himself an NBA player, but really, he wasn't," Fitzpatrick said. 
"The team had no NBA players. Not even any All-Coast players." 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff was one of the opposing centers the night Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 
points against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick and Gillis, coach at Orange Coast College, were scouting at a high 
school game in Fillmore when they heard of Wilt's 100. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped at the nearest Western Union and sent Imhoff a wire, 
'Congratulations on your fine defensive effort,' " Gillis said. "When he got 
it, we heard he was really steaming. I'm glad Fitz and I were clear across the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Imhoff still plays about 40 games a year with the Portland Trail Blazers' 
alumni team in charity exhibition games with teams in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Buch, the captain, was a 6-2, 190-pound guard from Brooklyn whose family moved 
to North Hollywood the year before he finished high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some offers from East Coast colleges, but when my family moved West, I 
wrote to Cal, Stanford, USC and USF," Buch said. "I was recommended to Newell 
by Bob McKeen, who I met in New York when he was back there for the College 
All-Star game. McKeen had played for Newell the year before." 
</P>
<P>
Buch, who played on three conference championship teams, was one of five 
players named in 1984 to the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches' silver 
anniversary All-American team for their basketball, career and public-service 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think, and you'll have to pardon my saying so, but I believe the key 
to the team, outside of the coaching, was that it was an inordinately 
intelligent group of guys," Buch said. "They all graduated and most became 
extremely successful in their life after basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Buch sold his business, Empco Industries, a tire and wheel firm 
with 80 retail outlets that did more than $100 million in business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to spend more time with my family and do some traveling and 
promotional work for the university," Buch said of his retirement. He is a 
member of the UC board of trustees and president of Southern Seas, a Cal 
booster group in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He and Fitzpatrick were co-chairman of a fund-raising dinner and golf 
tournament two weeks ago at the Lakeside Golf Club in North Hollywood, which 
helped raise more than $100,000 for a scholarship in perpetuity in Newell's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick was a hot-handed 6-foot, 160-pound guard when he went to Cal from 
Newport Harbor High by way of Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
"Denny was the finest perimeter shooter I ever coached," Newell said. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 20 points in the championship game against West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"I played my greatest game that night," he said at the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, Fitzpatrick coached a few years before getting into the 
finance business and eventually became president of the Mission Viejo-based 
Beverly Hills Federal Savings and Loan Assn., a position he resigned in 1984. 
Today, Fitzpatrick lives in Westwood and runs CBI Financial Services, which 
obtains financing for shopping centers and large construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"What successes I've had (in business) go directly back to Coach Newell," 
Fitzpatrick said. "He is the best coach ever -- it's not even close. And what 
he taught us carries over into our lives every day. Take this reunion, for 
instance. If Pete didn't keep coming back, we probably wouldn't keep on 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick named his oldest son, Pete, after his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the wives are close on our team," Fitz said. "My wife, Buffy, and Buch's 
wife, Jill, are from the same small town in England. Al and Jill were married a 
few years before I married Buffy. I think she married me so she could be close 
to Jill." 
</P>
<P>
Dalton, who owns his own insurance business in Pleasanton, is known as "the 
Thunderbird," so called because he was the only one in college with enough 
money to drive one. 
</P>
<P>
He was named the team's most inspirational player and still plays the role. He 
is the catalyst, the organizer and the planner, for the five-year reunions. 
</P>
<P>
"The most precious thing about the team, and these get-togethers, is that there 
were 17 guys involved, not five or six or seven, and every one of the 17 
graduated," Dalton said. "That is a tribute to Pete's way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
After Cal beat St. Mary's, 66-46, and Utah, 71-53, in the West Regional to gain 
the Final Four, the school was informed that only 12 players could suit up in 
Louisville. Newell insisted that the five others go with the team, and when 
championship awards were handed out, all 17 were included. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton is also something of a pixie. When asked to name his most vivid memory 
of the 1958-59 season, he wrote: "The St. Louis University game and the team 
shooting percentage, 19 for 78, caused by an all-day poker party preceding the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Cal lost, 55-43. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock was the only sophomore starter, but was the oldest player on the 
squad. He spent several years after high school drinking beer, working as a 
draftsman and playing industrial league ball in Milwaukee. A coach at Marquette 
told him he could never make it in college ball. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Newell, though, saw McClintock playing in Milwaukee and suggested 
he come West to play at Cal. McClintock was so enthusiastic that he paid his 
own way out, enrolled at Monterey Peninsula College to make up his grades, and 
joined the Bears as a 22-year-old sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates called him "Magnet" because the ball always seemed to come to him 
off the boards. Today, he is principal of a continuation high school in 
Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a great deal of satisfaction from working with kids who couldn't cut it 
in regular high school programs," he said. "In our school, we get to work with 
them one on one, and get a personal look at their development. A lot of the 
lessons I learned from Pete I use every day. He has been very influential in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Then there is Averbuck, the team philosopher and still its cheerleader. He came 
out of Roosevelt High in Los Angeles with the reputation as a high scorer, but 
in Newell's disciplined system, he played in only two games and never took a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Ned was one of our most important players, nevertheless," Newell praised. "He 
was the best bench jockey I ever had, and he also kept things livened up on our 
team. No one could ever get down on himself with Ned around. He was the 
ultimate holler guy." 
</P>
<P>
Averbuck has been chairman of the speech department at Laney College, a 
community college in Oakland, for 23 years and never tires of expressing his 
love for the university, his coach and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that man like my father," Averbuck said of Newell. "He taught us total 
dedication, devotion and desire for excellence through every practice. He gave 
us a unique feeling of team, and that is why nearly everyone associated with 
the team is here this weekend. To be with Pete again is like being with a loved 
one. We're family, Pete and all the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
He paused a moment for effect, then continued: "It's still hard to believe, 
though, that we won with the best players on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
The bench warmers cheered lustily. The first-stringers laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Newell coached only five seasons at California, but he is as revered on 
the campus at Berkeley as if he spent a lifetime there. He was only 44 when he 
retired after the 1960 NCAA final, although he remained eight more years as 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the floor of venerable, old Harmon Gym at Cal was named Newell Court. 
At the time, Newell was asked why he gave up coaching when he was so 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"I had done coaching," he said. "Plus, my doctor said I needed to give up 
cigarettes and coffee because they were messing up my lungs. And I couldn't 
coach without cigarettes and coffee." 
</P>
<P>
He had to miss the shirts-and-skins game among his old players Sunday to fly to 
Cleveland for a pre-NBA draft meeting with the Cavaliers' staff. Newell, 73, is 
a consultant and West Coast scout for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing my players gather every five years makes me very proud that they felt 
it was such a good experience that they wanted to continue reliving it," Newell 
said. "It is as high a tribute as a coach can get."

THE PETE ROSE INVESTIGATION; 
</P>
<P>
EXCERPTS FROM REPORT SUBMITTED TO COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excerpts from the report on Pete Rose submitted to the commissioner of baseball 
May 9 by investigator John Dowd. The report was made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
INTRODUCTION 
</P>
<P>
. . . Pete Rose has denied under oath ever betting on major league baseball or 
associating with anyone who bet on major league baseball. However, the 
investigation has developed evidence to the contrary. The testimony and the 
documentary evidence gathered in the course of the investigation demonstrates 
that Pete Rose bet on baseball, and in particular, on games of the Cincinnati 
Reds baseball club, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence showed that with few exceptions, Rose did not deal directly with 
bookmakers but rather placed his bets through others. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Although Rose placed his bets with (Ronald) Peters primarily through 
Tommy Gioiosa, on several occasions Rose placed bets on baseball games, 
including Cincinnati Reds games, directly with Peters. Rose's dealings with 
Gioiosa, and ultimately with Peters, are corroborated by the testimony of 
others and by Rose's own financial records as well. Rose admitted placing bets 
with Gioiosa on football and basketball games, but denied placing any bets on 
baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
. . . During the the 1987 baseball season, Rose utilized Paul Janszen to place 
his baseball bets after Rose and Gioiosa had a falling out in the spring of 
1987. Janszen relayed Rose's baseball bets to an acquaintance of Rose, Steve 
Chevashore, who in turn placed Rose's bets with a bookmaker in Staten Island, 
N.Y., identified only as "Val." Rose's betting on professional baseball, 
including Reds games, was testified to by Janszen and his girlfriend, Danita 
Marcum, and was discussed during a telephone conversation between Janszen and 
Chevashore. Rose's betting on baseball is further corroborated by betting 
records from Rose's home which have been identified by an expert as being in 
Rose's handwriting. Rose has denied placing any such bets with Janszen at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In May 1987, "Val" refused to accept bets on behalf of Rose due to Rose's 
failure to pay gambling debts. Thereafter, Rose's baseball bets were again 
placed with Ron Peters. However, instead of being placed by Gioiosa, Rose's 
bets were placed with Peters and by Paul Janszen. Between May and July 1987, 
Rose bet with Peters $2,000 per game on baseball, including Reds games. Rose's 
betting on baseball was also witnessed by Jim Procter and Dave Bernstein, who 
were acquaintances of Janszen. 
</P>
<P>
THE ROSE-GIOIOSA-PETERS BETTING: 1985 AND 1986 
</P>
<P>
The betting records of Janszen and Peters, however, indicate baseball bets of 
$500, $1,500, $2,000 on the Cincinnati Reds and other major league teams. 
According to Janszen and Peters, the $500 baseball bets were Janszen's and the 
$2,000 bets were Rose's. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Peters testified that he took bets from Gioiosa and Pete Rose during the 
period from late 1984 to late 1986, when he stopped taking Rose's action. He 
stated that Pete Rose bet on professional football, college basketball, and 
major league baseball. He specifically stated that Pete Rose bet on major 
league baseball games in 1985, 1986 and 1987, including games played by the 
Cincinnati Reds while Pete Rose was a player and manager. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Rose admitted that he has bet on sports events since 1975. The only 
person with whom Rose acknowledged making bets was Tommy Gioiosa, with whom 
Rose said he placed bets on professional football and college and professional 
basketball games, from 1984-1985. Rose stated Gioiosa was not a bookmaker, but 
claimed he did not know with whom Gioiosa placed the bets. Rose stated that 
Gioiosa never called a bookmaker from Rose's house. 
</P>
<P>
During the deposition, Rose revealed a good deal of personal knowledge of how 
bookmakers operate. For example, Rose stated that he settled up his bets on 
Tuesday after the weekend and Monday night football games were over. Rose 
explained that bookies make their money by charging a 10 percent fee, which he 
volunteered was called "vigorish," a bookmaking term. 
</P>
<P>
PAUL JANSZEN AND DANITA MARCUM 
</P>
<P>
Janszen testified he recalled that Pete Rose bet through Gioiosa on the 1986 
National League playoffs between Houston and the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Danita Marcum (Janszen's girlfriend) confirmed that she and Paul Janszen were 
invited to Pete Rose's home during the period of September through December of 
1986. She recalled witnessing Rose, Gioiosa and Bertolini placing bets. She 
said she saw large amounts of cash in Pete Rose's home. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of February 1987, Rose invited Janszen and Marcum to come to his 
home in Florida while he was at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Following spring training sessions, Rose and Janszen routinely would go to 
Tampa Bay Downs Racetrack. There, Rose introduced Janszen to Mario Nunez. . . . 
Rose also introduced Janszen to Steve Chevashore, and Chevashore's uncle, Howie 
Bernstein. Janszen watched Rose bet large amounts of money on horse racing. 
According to Janszen, Rose had Chevashore cash his winning tickets to evade his 
tax liability. 
</P>
<P>
Rose however, denied that Chevashore ever "ran" bets for him at the track. Rose 
also testified that he bet very little money at Tampa Bay Downs and that the 
most he lost there was "seven hundred bucks." 
</P>
<P>
At Pete Rose's request, Janszen began placing Rose's bets with Steve Chevashore 
on various sports action, including basketball, hockey and later, baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, Janszen and Chevashore had an understanding that the size of the bets 
Janszen was placing for Rose would always be for $2,000, "no matter what the 
game was, no matter when the game was being played." . . . Rose denied that 
Paul Janszen ever placed bets for him on baseball, football or basketball 
games, or did anything other than possibly place a bet for him at the 
racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
As the Janszen-Chevashore relationship continued, Janszen learned the identity 
of the bookmaker with whom Chevashore used to place Rose's bets. Janszen never 
knew his last name but his nickname was Val, and he was located in Staten 
Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Rose asked Janszen to continue placing the bets with Steve Chevashore 
in Florida. At this time, Rose was betting on baseball, basketball and hockey. 
Rose's betting activity is corroborated not only by the other evidence 
previously described, but also by documentary evidence such as betting sheets 
showing bets on baseball games in Rose's own handwriting; Janszen's betting 
notebook; and the numerous telephone calls to Chevashore from Janszen's home 
and Rose's home. In mid-April 1987, Chevashore directed Janszen to place Rose's 
bets directly with Val in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In a taped conversation between Paul Janszen and Steve Chevashore on Dec. 27, 
1988, Chevashore confirmed the incident, and that Rose was betting on the 
Cincinnati-Montreal game. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen continued to place bets on baseball and other sports with Val on behalf 
of Rose until the middle of May 1987 when Val refused to take any more bets 
from Pete Rose because of Rose's unpaid debts. 
</P>
<P>
From April 7, 1987, until May 13, 1977, Rose lost $67,900 as a result of his 
bets with Val. Rose however, gave Janszen only a small amount of money to cover 
those losses. 
</P>
<P>
ROSE-JANSZEN-PETERS BETTING 
</P>
<P>
Since Val refused to take any more action, Rose asked Paul Janszen to contact 
Ron Peters to place his bets. Peters informed Janszen that he was willing to 
take Rose's action, but that Rose still owed him $34,000 from Rose's 1986 
betting. Janszen relayed Peters' message to Rose. Rose explained to Janszen 
that during spring training 1987, he had authorized his attorney, Reuven Katz, 
to issue a check from his account in the amount of $34,000 to Tommy Gioiosa to 
pay off the debt to Peters. Accordingly, Janszen told Peters that if he had not 
been paid, it was only because Gioiosa had not given the $34,000 from Rose's 
check to him. Therefore, to demonstrate Rose's good faith in paying his debt to 
Peters from the 1986 betting, Janszen obtained a copy of the $34,000 check in 
May 1987 from Pete Rose and gave it to Peters. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how Peters got a copy of the check in May 1987, Rose said: "I 
couldn't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Did you give it to them? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No, I didn't give them the check. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's testimony that the $34,000 check of March 12, 1987, was to cover 
gambling losses on the 1987 Super Bowl and the 1987 NCAA basketball tournament 
appears to be in conflict with his other testimony that the most he ever bet 
was $2,000 on the Super Bowl and the fact that the 1987 NCAA tournament did not 
begin until March 12, 1987, the date of the $34,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing a copy of the $34,000 check, Peters was satisfied that Rose had 
attempted to pay off the debt. Thus on May 17, 1987, Rose began betting with 
Peters again. Peters testified that during the period from May to July 4, 1987, 
Janszen was betting $2,000 to $5,000 for Rose per game on baseball, including 
the Reds. Peters testified that he would not have accepted bets if they were 
Janszen's, and not Rose's, due to Janszen's lack of financial ability. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: And, again, were you satisfied that those bets were for Rose? 
</P>
<P>
Peters: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Would you have taken those size bets from Janszen? 
</P>
<P>
Peters: No. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Peters stated that Rose was his only betting customer for baseball. 
Peters also testified that Rose won $27,000 in the first week of betting in May 
1987 and approximately $40,000 for the month of June 1987. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Janszen testified that Rose initially won close to $25,000 during the 
first week of the betting with Peters, which Janszen collected and gave to 
Rose. During the second week, Rose lost most of the money he had won the first 
week. Janszen described how Rose took cash out of his kitchen cabinet, counted 
the money he lost, and gave it to him. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen then took the money to Peters. Janszen testified that during June and 
July 1987, Pete Rose won approximately $40,000 from Peters betting on baseball, 
including the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen: Pete started betting with Ron Peters. Pete won his first two weeks. I 
went up there and collected $25,000, $2,000 was mine and $23,000 was Pete's. I 
handed Pete the money. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen: Week three, he loses back almost all of it. I take the money from 
Pete's house, from Pete's hand, take it up to Franklin, Ohio, and that's week 
three. Weeks four, five, six and seven and maybe eight, Pete won every week, or 
if he didn't win, he might have broke even. . . . At the end of that time, he 
was up 40-some thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, however, refused to pay the $40,000 to Rose because Rose owed him 
$34,000 from losses in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Rose testified that Paul Janszen never placed bets for him on any sports 
activity, nor was he aware that Janszen ever bet at all. This testimony is 
contradicted by Donald Stenger (an associate of Michael Fry). Stenger recalled 
having dinner with Pete and Carol Rose, Janszen, Danita Marcum and Stenger's 
girlfriend at a Chinese restaurant in Philadelphia when the Reds were in town 
to play the Phillies in 1987. While at a restaurant, Janszen pulled out a sheet 
of paper with betting information on it and went to make a phone call. Stenger 
said there was no discussion about betting, or what was on the sheet. Stenger 
believes that the four or five games listed on the sheet were basketball games. 
He concluded this based on his personal opinion that Rose would never bet on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
ROSE AND JOSEPH CAMBRA 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cambra, from Somerset, Mass., was charged with being a bookmaker in 
1984, and subsequently pleaded guilty to gambling charges in 1986. Pete Rose 
acknowledged meeting Cambra during spring training in West Palm Beach, Fla., in 
February 1984, while Rose was a player with the Montreal Expos. Rose stated 
that he did now know Cambra was a bookmaker, or that he had been convicted of 
bookmaking, until about two weeks prior to his deposition on April 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rose denied ever betting with Cambra or going to the racetrack with him. Rose 
testified that the only financial transaction he had with Cambra involved a 
real estate deal in which Cambra told Rose he could double his money. 
</P>
<P>
Rose stated that he has seen Cambra five to six days a year from 1984 to 1989, 
during spring training. When Cambra comes to Florida, Rose asks the Reds 
traveling secretary to get Cambra a room. . . . When asked whether Cambra ever 
was in the Reds clubhouse, Rose responded, "Well, it's all according to what 
your definition of the clubhouse is." Rose stated that Cambra has been in his 
office, but not in the part of the clubhouse where the players are. 
</P>
<P>
SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose denied under oath placing bets or causing others to place bets on the 
Cincinnati Reds and other ballgames of major league baseball. Indeed, Rose 
denied under oath ever associating with anyone placing bets on his behalf on 
the Cincinnati Reds or the games of major league baseball. He admitted placing 
bets with Tommy Gioiosa on other sports activity, but denied knowing the Ohio 
bookmaker or other bookmakers in New York. He denied being delinquent in paying 
his gambling losses or having borrowed from his associates and friends to pay 
his gambling losses. 
</P>
<P>
THE KEY EVIDENCE 
</P>
<P>
The evidence should be viewed as a whole in order to obtain a clear picture. 
Nevertheless, it is important to note the following five distinct pieces of 
evidence pointing to Pete Rose's betting on the Reds and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First, the three-page document in Rose's handwriting recording baseball 
games and the results. Pete Rose's explanation that he does not recognize the 
document or the handwriting is perhaps the only answer he can render given his 
posture in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Second, the notebook of Paul Janszen recording the betting action of Pete 
Rose from April 7, 1987, to May 3, 1987, on Reds games as well as other games. 
To those who might suggest the notebook was fabricated by an unpaid creditor, 
the next piece of evidence should be closely examined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third, the telephone traffic in the collective telephone records bears 
remarkable witness to the betting action before the game time of the Cincinnati 
Reds -- home or away, night or day -- particularly the unexplained calls from 
Rose's home and hotel rooms to Chevashore, Val and Peters during the baseball 
season. Rose offered no explanation for these telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fourth, the betting records of Ron Peters which show baseball betting 
action on the Reds and other major league baseball games in 1987 by one 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fifth, the unguarded statements of Steve Chevashore on a tape contradicted 
Rose's statement that Janszen, Chevashore and Val were not involved in the 
sports betting action on the Cincinnati Reds or major league baseball for Pete 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixth, the Bertolini tape reveals not only questions as to Rose's testimony 
about his gambling habit, but the modus operandi employed by Rose to disguise 
and conceal his enormous gambling indebtedness, the identity of his bookmakers 
and his betting on baseball. The generating of funds through loans to 
Bertolini, the remission of checks to fictitious payees, and the delay in the 
production of bank records from Star Bank and Oak Hills Savings and Loan all 
raise serious question whether Pete Rose is trying to conceal his gambling on 
baseball and the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
SUMMARIES OF PETERS AND JANSZEN TESTIMONY 
</P>
<P>
The sworn, voluntary, corroborated testimony of Ron Peters, the bookmaker from 
Franklin, Ohio, establishes that he took bets from Pete Rose, and from Tommy 
Gioiosa, Paul Janszen and Danita Marcum on behalf of Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Janszen has given voluntary, sworn testimony, without the promise of 
reward, that in April, May, June and July 1987 he placed bets of $2,000 per 
game on the Cincinnati Reds and other major league baseball games for Pete Rose 
with Steve Chevashore, a runner of bets in Florida; with Val, a clerk for a 
bookmaking operation in New York; and with Ron Peters, a bookmaker in Franklin, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
ANALYSIS OF ROSE'S TESTIMONY 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose testified he did not recognize the handwriting on the three betting 
slips found in his home. Yet, according to a handwriting expert, the games of 
the Cincinnati Reds are recorded in Rose's handwriting on the betting sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose testified that he never bet on the Reds or on baseball with Ron 
Peters. Yet, his bets on the Reds and baseball appear in Peters' betting 
records for the 1987 baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose testified that he never bet on the Reds or on baseball with Paul 
Janszen or Danita Marcum. Yet, the records of Janszen and Marcum show bets on 
the Reds and baseball during the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose did not explain how Ron Peters and Paul Janszen came into possession 
of a copy of the $34,000 check to Gioiosa written by Rose's attorney on March 
12, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose claimed the $34,000 . . . was to pay for his gambling losses on the 
1987 Super Bowl and the 1987 NCAA basketball championship, not the gambling 
losses to Ron Peters in 1986. But, the NCAA basketball tournament had not begun 
before March 12, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose denies knowing Ron Peters . . . but the record of the Cincinnati Reds 
show tickets for Peters were ordered by Rose in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose said he entrusted Mike Bertolini with hundreds of thousands of 
dollars because Bertolini was an honest man. However, when Rose heard the 
unguarded statements by Bertolini on the April 4, 1988 tape, describing the 
payment of those funds to a New York bookmaker on behalf of Rose, Pete Rose 
said Bertolini was lying. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose testified that he had never placed bets with a person named Val, had 
never spoken with a person named Val and did not know anyone named Val. . . . 
However, the unguarded statements of Chevashore on the Dec. 27, 1988, tape 
contradict Rose's sworn testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence revealed that in order to protect his stature as one of the most 
famous baseball players in major league history, Pete Rose employed middlemen 
to place bets for him with bookmakers and at the racetrack and to pay gambling 
losses and collect gambling winnings, thereby concealing his gambling activity. 
Rose befriended, entertained and promoted the businesses of friends and through 
this arrangement protected his betting from public exposure. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote checks payable to cash, to a close associate and to fictitious persons 
for amounts under $10,000 so as to avoid detection by the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose testified that he was ignorant of the activities of his companions. 
His ignorance of their criminal activities allows Rose to use these young men 
for his own purposes and if they are caught -- claim they are not credible. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Peters, Janszen and Fry has been voluntary and forthright. 
Each has stood before the bar of justice and engaged in the most painful act of 
integrity -- the admission of guilt to illegal acts. Each is now paying the 
debt society imposed for his acts against society. None of them has anything to 
gain for his voluntary act of cooperation with this investigation.

PUCKETT TOO MUCH FOR A'S IN TWINS' 4-3 VICTORY

<P>
It seems as if Kirby Puckett didn't feel much like losing Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
After driving in two runs with a triple and a single to give Minnesota an early 
lead, Puckett hit a solo home run with two out in the 10th inning to propel the 
Twins past the Oakland Athletics, 4-3, at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland tied the game with a run in the ninth, but left the bases loaded later 
in the inning. Minnesota, 7 1/2 games behind first-place Oakland, won for the 
12th time in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett hit his fifth homer of the season off Todd Burns (4-2), who had not 
allowed a home run in 56 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon (2-2) gave up the Athletics' tying run in the ninth but pitched a 
perfect 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland is 0-6 in extra-inning games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Rawley limited Oakland to two hits over the first six innings, but left 
after Mark McGwire's run-scoring single in the seventh made it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics took a 1-0 lead in the third when Mike Gallego walked with two 
out and scored on Rickey Henderson's double. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett and Randy Bush had RBI singles in the bottom of the third. Wally 
Backman singled in the sixth and scored on Puckett's triple for a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Kent Hrbek made his first appearance since dislocating his left 
shoulder on May 15 and went one for three. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Texas 3 -- John Farrell won for only the second time in nine 
decisions and Doug Jones earned his 17th save as the Indians beat the Rangers 
at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell (4-8) gave up three runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland scored twice in the first inning as Bobby Witt (5-8) retired only two 
batters. It was the shortest start of Witt's four-year career in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, Jerry Browne drew a leadoff walk and, with two out, the Indians 
hit three consecutive singles. Pete O'Brien and Cory Snyder singled home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Texas scored in the second inning on an RBI grounder by Rick Leach. Joel 
Skinner's run-scoring single and a squeeze bunt by Felix Fermin put Cleveland 
ahead, 4-1, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Leach doubled in the fifth and Steve Buechele and Rafael Palmeiro hit RBI 
singles to get Texas to within a run. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger catcher Geno Petralli was injured in a collision with Skinner at home 
plate in the fourth inning and was carried off the field on a stretcher. 
Petralli sustained a torn ligament in his left knee and the Rangers estimate he 
will be out of action for six to eight weeks.

JOYNER FITS THE BILL FOR CLEANUP; 
</P>
<P>
HE HAS IDEAL TEMPERAMENT TO BAT FOURTH FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' cleanup hitter hit a home run the other day. This is notable in 
that the Angels' cleanup hitter hit his last home run in April and the one 
before that in September. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' cleanup hitter can recite the dates of his three most recent home 
runs from memory -- Sept. 1, April 27, June 25. He went 169 at-bats between the 
last two. Before that, he went 183 at-bats between home runs. 
</P>
<P>
So why do the Angels employ such a cleanup hitter? 
</P>
<P>
Because Wally Joyner has to bat somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader, the Angel manager, has tinkered with different names in the No. 4 
batting slot. Devon White spent some time there, but generally proved too free 
a swinger for the assignment. Lance Parrish struck out too often. Brian Downing 
got a trial run, too, but if he isn't batting leadoff, he feels most 
comfortable hitting in the lower half of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Wally's the only one who really has the makeup to do it," Rader said 
in early June. 
</P>
<P>
By that, Rader meant temperament, the kind that can deal with the pressures of 
the job -- having to hit with runners on base, having to drive in important 
runs, having to put the ball in the air when the situation calls for a 
sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing bothers him," Rader said of Joyner. "He catches the ball, he hits the 
ball, he's got a terrific attitude. What else can you ask of a guy?" 
</P>
<P>
A few home runs? 
</P>
<P>
Joyner used to be able to hit them. In 1987, he had 34 of them. As a rookie in 
1986, he hit 22, 16 of those during the first six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1987 season, however, Joyner has managed just 15 home runs 
-- 13 in 1988 and two in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Where has all the power gone? 
</P>
<P>
Theories have abounded. Lately, Rader has hit upon a new one. He bases it on 
the idea that because Joyner started the 1989 season so poorly -- .213 after 
April, .247 after May -- he had to first regain his singles-hitting stroke 
before he could indulge in thoughts of grander things. 
</P>
<P>
"Wally was struggling so hard early on, he first had to get feeling good about 
himself," Rader said. "That's hard to do when you're hitting .180. Hit .180 and 
try to hit home runs and you'll end up hitting .140. 
</P>
<P>
"Wally went out and worked on getting his swing back and getting his average up 
to where he's comfortable with it. The way he's gone about it is probably the 
soundest way. Most people panic. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he gets up to .290, .300, the rest will fall into place. The rest will 
come by accident." 
</P>
<P>
Since June 1, Joyner has raised his batting average 44 points to .291, so, 
apparently, Joyner is feeling comfortable again. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner has batted cleanup before. Gene Mauch and Cookie Rojas both tried him 
there, but Joyner's best hitting has been done while batting third in the 
order, away from the glare that goes with the No. 4 spot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had a mental block about hitting there my first two years," Joyner 
said. "There are expectations that go with being the No. 4 hitter. One, you 
have to hit the ball hard every time. Two, you have to hit home runs. Whenever 
I hit fourth, I (felt) so much outside pressure that it was hard for me to do 
much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner still doesn't regard himself as a true cleanup hitter. He knows what 
they look like -- Mark McGwire, Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry, Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never considered myself a home run hitter," he said. "Coming into my 
first year, the expectations of Wally Joyner were: good line-drive hitter, 
maybe 10 to 15 home runs, maybe 80 RBIs a year. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, I've got 217 RBIs and 60 home runs in two years. I was just 
as surprised as everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I created some expectations. It made it hard for me to live up to them 
-- the expectations of others, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably won't hit 34 homers again in a season. But that doesn't mean I'm 
not ever going to have a good season again. If I don't hit 34 home runs, does 
that make me unsuccessful? No." 
</P>
<P>
And right now, the Angels need their cleanup hitter to drive in runs, be it 
with singles, doubles, sacrifice flies or ground-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hitting fourth because I'm hot right now," Joyner said. "I'm getting my 
base hits. And if I'm getting my base hits batting fourth, there's a better 
chance to get us some runs." 
</P>
<P>
If the Angels can handle a cleanup hitter who clears the fences every other 
month, Joyner figures he can handle the rest of it.

TIME INC. REJECTS SWEETENED OFFER FROM PARAMOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Time Inc.'s board of directors moved swiftly Monday to reject as "inadequate" 
the sweetened $12.2-billion bid for Time that Paramount Communications made 
only last Friday. The reaction was widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
Time also attacked the new Paramount bid in federal court, only to be slapped 
in turn with a surprise Delaware lawsuit filed by a powerful group of investors 
who -- until Monday -- had refused to confirm their stakes in Time. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the latest Delaware suit seeks to force Time to negotiate 
with Paramount. It was filed by the Robert M. Bass group, Hollywood 
entrepreneur A. Jerrold Perenchio and Cablevision Media Partners, which is 
believed to be controlled by New York cable TV executive Charles F. Dolan. 
According to the suit, the Bass group owns over 600,000 shares of Time stock, 
while Perenchio and Dolan together control about 1.2 million shares. The three 
groups together hold less than 5% of Time shares. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the Bass group is asking a Delaware judge to delay Time's 
shareholder meeting Friday because the company has not recirculated proxy 
materials since Paramount made its surprise bid three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also contends that shareholders should be granted more time to 
nominate an opposing slate of directors to the four incumbents -- including 
three Time executives -- who are standing for election. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, however, Time Vice Chairman Gerald M. Levin said at 
least three letters have gone out to Time shareholders to keep them informed of 
recent events. He insisted that most of the matters before the shareholders 
remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
One major difference, however, is that Time will no longer ask its shareholders 
to vote on a stock-swap merger with Warner Communications Inc., because Time's 
board decided to acquire Warner for $14 billion after Paramount mounted its 
hostile offer. Time's directors -- empowered to acquire companies without the 
approval of shareholders -- decided not to risk a shareholder vote on the 
Warner purchase, which has enraged some investors because the company will take 
on billions of dollars in debt without paying any cash to Time shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's four-hour board meeting, Time's directors said their investment 
bankers had reaffirmed their earlier assessment of the Warner acquisition and 
advised directors against accepting the $200-a-share Paramount bid, increased 
from the earlier $175-a-share offer. They also contended that Paramount has not 
yet met its own conditions for the offer by arranging takeover financing, 
completing the transfer of Time's cable licenses and rescinding the 
anti-takeover stock swap with Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Challenges 
</P>
<P>
Paramount said the rejection would not end its 3-week-old takeover effort. "We 
will continue to pursue our acquisition of Time in a calm, studied, and 
deliberate manner," Paramount said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a federal court in Manhattan, Time filed new legal challenges to 
the sweetened Paramount bid, attacking it as misleading because Paramount 
allegedly fails to tell shareholders that it cannot purchase Time shares by the 
July 7 expiration date advertised. A hearing on the issue is scheduled late 
tomorrow afternoon before U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, Time shares fell $1.875 to $164 on volume of 1.8 million 
shares, as the Time board's reaction was widely anticipated. Paramount's stock, 
fueled by new rumors that the hostile bidder may itself be a takeover target, 
advanced $2.375 to $60.375 on heavy volume of 2.4 million shares, making it the 
most actively traded issue. Warner edged up 25 cents to $58.875 on volume of 
1.9 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Time's Levin refused to comment on a published report that the company's 
investment bankers have valued Time at $250 a share. "The banks have given a 
value of the company, and what we've said is that $200 is not within that 
zone," Levin said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Time said in a letter to Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis that Time last year 
had considered acquiring Paramount but had rejected the move "as a less 
desirable means of achieving" the goals it hopes to meet with the Warner 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Time's letter said the media giant had taken a new, detailed look at its 
decision to buy Warner "that completely reconfirms our judgment that acquiring 
Warner is the optimum means to implement our long-term strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Time's rejection "was anything but a surprise," said Peter P. Appert, analyst 
with the C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell investment firm in New York. "No matter 
what they're doing today, it's all going to come down to the what the courts in 
Delaware say."

INDUSTRY BALKS AT PROPOSED TANKER LAW; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS SAY DOUBLE HULLS WOULD TRIPLE HEADACHES, SCUTTLE REBOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shipping and oil industry executives said Monday that a possible law requiring 
double hulls on oil tankers would come at a time when the shipping industry is 
just beginning to recover from years of losses and would complicate plans to 
replenish the aging tanker fleet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, any such law would be costly and could have unintended effects on 
an industry dominated by foreign carriers, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
Because old tankers would be exempted from the requirement, it is conceivable 
that foreign shippers might opt to send their older ships to U.S. waters, while 
building new, cheaper, single-hull tankers for use elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandating to the international community without broad support from the 
international maritime community creates problems that may be hard to sort 
out," said Douglas Wolcott, president of Chevron Shipping Co., the marine 
transportation unit of Chevron U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
A bill introduced by Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) would require all new oil 
tankers over 20,000 tons dead weight to be equipped with double hulls. That 
would include both U.S. and foreign carriers operating in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
The bill already has cleared one Senate panel. Adams said oil spills are 
inevitable. "So you try to avoid that by making your vessels safer, your 
response time quicker, and having equipment at hand to begin the cleanup 
immediately," said Adams, a former Transportation Secretary and longtime 
proponent of regulations requiring double-hulled tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the world's estimated 3,200 tankers, oil companies operate about 332 ships 
of at least 10,000 tons dead weight each; foreign governments and their 
companies operate 799, and independent companies -- including giants in Hong 
Kong, Japan and Europe -- operate the rest, said Arthur McKenzie, a tanker 
consultant and director of the Tanker Advisory Center. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fraction of the tankers are registered in the United States. Far more 
common are so-called "registries of convenience" in countries from Liberia to 
Panama to Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the Coast Guard, the Office of Technology Assessment and others have 
reached varying conclusions about whether a double-hull design would lessen the 
effects of spills like the one at Valdez, Alaska, or those that took place in 
the waters off Pennsylvania, Rhode Island or Texas over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But shipping analysts agree that requiring new tankers to have double hulls 
would add significantly to the cost of building new tankers. 
</P>
<P>
A new supertanker of 250,000 tons costs about $70 million to $80 million, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite expensive to add a second skin," said James Winchester, shipping 
industry analyst with Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. in New York. "It would add on the 
order of another $16 million," he estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring that new tankers have a second hull could affect the shipping 
industry's decisions about replenishing its aging tanker fleet. For many 
operators, "freight rates do not even justify building a single-hull tanker," 
Winchester said. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of new tanker building is far below that of the late 1970s, when a 
supertanker building boom resulted in overcapacity, helping to drive shipping 
rates to rock-bottom. A few years ago, freight rates were running about $5,000 
to $6,000 per day and shippers believed that they were better off selling their 
tankers for scrap than operating them, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "The overbuilding that occurred in the 1970s is being used up quite 
rapidly, and probably we'll see some building beginning," said Jerry Aspland, a 
tanker captain and president of Arco Marine Inc., the shipping unit of Atlantic 
Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$30,000 or More Per Day 
</P>
<P>
Shippers are encouraged in part by freight rates that have begun climbing again 
as the surplus capacity has shrunk to 42.4 million tons in February from 93.6 
million tons in 1985, McKenzie reported. At the same time, the tanker fleet is 
aging -- the average age of a tanker is about 13.5 years, McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron, which owns 41 tankers and charters another 20 to 30, has four new 
tankers on order at the moment, Wolcott said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, to cover the costs of building a new freighter, a shipper must charge 
freight rates of $30,000 or more per day, Winchester estimated. Current rates 
are averaging about $16,000 per day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the international oil industry and the tanker market were to agree from now 
on to build only double-hull vessels, we would see the ultimate freight rate 
build that much higher, somewhere around $40,000 a day. The market absolutely 
won't support that," Winchester said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the new law "would make the U.S. market a different market than 
other foreign markets, unless other countries follow suit," one shipping 
executive said. "And that could mean . . . that the U.S. gets the older tankers 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
"If (a foreign shipper's) choice is to spend a considerable amount more for a 
double-hulled vessel or to save the money and simply send their new 
(single-hulled) vessel somewhere else, economically, they may be forced to send 
the old grandfathered vessels here, because someone else will do that and 
undercut them." 
</P>
<P>
Requiring double hulls could ultimately reduce the available shipping tonnage, 
with resulting increases in freight rates, said Karl Meyer, chairman of Marine 
Transport Lines, one of the larger independent shippers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Any kind of environmental or safety response, any way to upgrade vessels . . . 
(will be) passed on to the end user, and that will be the oil company," 
McKenzie said.

AUSTRALIA TO LIFT BOND'S TV, RADIO LICENSES 
</P>

Australian businessman Alan Bond lost a three-year battle Monday when the 
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal ruled that one of the companies he controls is 
unfit to run the country's largest television and radio network. 
</P>
<P>
The tribunal's rulings apply to companies, not individuals, but the tribunal 
left no doubt that its findings were aimed at Bond personally. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider that he would not be found to be a fit and proper person to hold a 
broadcasting license," Tribunal member Kim Wilson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling marked a low point in the British-born entrepreneur's career. Bond 
was Australia's hero when he won the America's Cup yachting race six years ago, 
but his fortunes have slumped, along with the stock in his companies. 
</P>
<P>
Bond's ethics have been the focus of a yearlong inquiry into his $328,000 
out-of-court libel settlement with a leading politician. 
</P>
<P>
In a 14-page statement, the tribunal said Bond's acts could not be divorced 
from the broadcasting network of which he is principal stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
The Perth-based millionaire, whose interests range from real estate to brewing, 
controls the Bond Media company through direct stock holdings and through his 
Bond Corp., which holds 52.8% of Bond Media. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controls Many Stations 
</P>
<P>
Bond Media controls six television stations, nine radio stations and a 
satellite TV service. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bond vowed Monday to fight the charges of deceit and impropriety. "I will 
pursue every avenue open to me to clear my name," he said after the tribunal 
issued its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Bond also has been struggling against claims that his flagship Bond Corp. is 
faltering under huge debts. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered another, separate blow Monday as the Australian Stock Exchange 
suspended from trading his Bell Resources offshoot, citing his failure to 
supply enough information on a plan to sell Bond Corp.'s global brewing assets 
to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Australia's broadcasting tribunal, which has the power to suspend or revoke 
licenses, said it would allow two weeks for submissions from Bond and tribunal 
counsel before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both parties expect the case to be referred to Australia's 
highest court, the Federal Court in Canberra. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks in Bond Media, the company involved in the tribunal's ruling, and Bond 
Corp. have plunged on the allegations of impropriety. Listed in 1987 at $1.55 
Australian a share, Bond Media slumped to 28 cents Australian at Monday's 
close, down 2 cents. Bond Corp. dropped 9 cents to finish at $1.01 Australian a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deceit Claimed 
</P>
<P>
In April the tribunal ruled against Bond on several counts, most of them linked 
to his settlement with the former premier of the state of Queensland, Sir John 
Bjelke-Petersen. The tribunal said Bond misled it during the inquiry and tried 
to disguise the agreement and payment. 
</P>
<P>
"An attempt at such deceit, driven, as it would appear to be in this case, by 
expediency, does not exhibit qualities which we would expect to repose in the 
character of a fit and proper person," the tribunal said. 
</P>
<P>
The tribunal also accepted evidence that Bond threatened a business rival at 
the powerful Australia Mutual Provident Society pension fund with bad publicity 
by using his "TV staff" to gather information. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that one of the great risks for a person who controls such 
significant resources as television and radio networks is to misuse them," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tribunal, which heard evidence from 41 witnesses over 42 days, said Bond 
appeared unable to differentiate between commercial expediency and the extra 
responsibilities inherent in media ownership.

Prospective home buyers failed to take advantage of falling mortgage rates in 
May, judging from the fact that sales of existing homes fell 5.6% to their 
lowest level in 16 months, the National Assn. of Realtors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate trade group said sales of single-family homes fell last month 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units, down from 3.4 
million units in both March and April. The May resale rate was off 11.3% from a 
year ago, the association said, and was the lowest since January, 1988, when 
3.2 million units were sold. 
</P>
<P>
The statement from the national group followed last week's report by the 
California Assn. of Realtors that the pace of sales of existing homes in 
California had fallen even more sharply, dropping 9.5% below that of May, 1988.

TRIAL OVER '84 'GREENMAIL' OF DISNEY BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Superior Court jury heard conflicting accounts Monday of 
why Walt Disney Co. directors bought out raider Saul P. Steinberg in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The differing versions came in opening arguments in a class-action lawsuit by 
some Disney stockholders, spearheaded by stock market professionals, against 
Steinberg, the company and directors. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders are seeking unspecified damages related to the plunge in 
Disney's stock price after the Burbank-based film and theme-park company bought 
Steinberg's 11% stake in the company at above-market prices, resulting in a 
$59-million profit for Steinberg. While held under court order in a special 
fund, the money has grown to about $100 million with interest. 
</P>
<P>
The varying interpretations of the events of five years ago provided trails 
leading in a number of different directions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Described as Farsighted 
</P>
<P>
The stockholders contend that the 1984 Disney board was acting in its own 
self-interest and was unfaithful to shareholders in paying Steinberg at the 
expense of shareholders. Their attorney, J. Michael Hennigan, wanted to use the 
expression "greenmail" to describe the above-market-value payment in his 
opening statement since it was used in court papers, but Judge Abby Soven would 
not permit it. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the directors described the board as farsighted and wise in 
warding off a hostile takeover and a breakup of the company. 
</P>
<P>
And the interpretation from Steinberg's corner was of feisty and resourceful 
directors virtually strong-arming the raider into selling his stock. That view 
was offered by Arthur L. Liman, a New York attorney for Steinberg who became 
nationally recognized in representing the Senate in the Iran-Contra hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys all have the task of reconciling their versions of events to such 
facts as the board's decision to seek the resignations of Disney's top officers 
shortly after the buyout. Roy E. Disney, nephew of the company founder, 
rejoined the board afterward and helped bring in the Michael D. Eisner 
management team, which has been behind the company's soaring profits. 
</P>
<P>
The parties did generally agree that Disney is a company with a unique place in 
American culture. Therefore, they contend, its brush with nearly being 
dismantled is seen as likely to be of more than routine public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Hennigan told the jury that "one of the most feared raiders on Wall Street 
extracted" his gains by threatening a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg was aided by a then-unprecedented agreement with investment banker 
Drexel Burnham Lambert to avoid helping anyone take over Disney for two years, 
the lawyer added. Drexel, which acted as financial adviser to Steinberg's 
Reliance Insurance and related firms, is a defendant in the case, along with 
Disney's investment banker, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eisner Team Not Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Hennigan made it clear to the jurors, who said during their selection that they 
had enjoyable visits to Disneyland, that he was not criticizing the Eisner 
management at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
He said that during the reign of Ronald W. Miller, former chief executive, 
market professionals saw the company as undervalued. The lawyer added that this 
is "a nice way of saying mismanaged." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Diamond, attorney for the individual Disney defendants, told the jury 
that the directors exercised their best judgment in the Steinberg affair. The 
evidence will show they were correct and that this benefited the company and 
stockholders who held on to their stock, he added. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that all was "not perfect" at the company in 1984, Diamond said 
the board had a five-year plan to develop the firm and was able to "save the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Liman portrayed the Disney directors as being far from the image of caving in 
to Steinberg. Rather, he said, the board "played hardball" and blocked his 
client by aggressive means. The culmination, he said, was the board's threat to 
have the company mount an offer for its stock that would make it almost 
inoperable if Steinberg resisted. 
</P>
<P>
He said the emissary who carried the message to Steinberg was one of his 
friends, Laurence A. Tisch, presently CBS president and chief executive. That, 
said Liman, was when Steinberg gave up and met Disney's demands.

INVESTOR HOLDS 7.1% STAKE IN TORRANCE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kansas City investor John Latshaw reported Monday that he controls a 7.1% stake 
in Standard Brands Paint Co. of Torrance. He described the holding as an 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Latshaw, chairman of Latshaw Enterprises, a manufacturer of mechanical controls 
and molded plastic parts in Missouri, said in a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that his company owns 202,700 of the 405,400 shares that he 
controls. The SEC filing also indicated that the 7.1% stake includes 178,150 
shares acquired from April 17 to June 16 for $14.50 to $16.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, Standard Brands common stock spurted to 
a 52-week high of $19.375 before falling back to close the day's trading at 
$16.75, off 87.50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Brands is a leading do-it-yourself home-decorating retailer and paint 
manufacturer. It was the target of two takeover bids in 1987, prompting the 
company to repurchase 6 million of its common shares -- 53% of the total then 
outstanding -- through a tender offer of $25 a share. The stock was trading at 
about $21 a share at the time. 
</P>
<P>
A Standard Brands spokesman declined comment on Latshaw's filing. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Brands' net income fell to $8 million on net sales of $304.4 million 
in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, down from profit of $15 million on net sales 
of $305.5 million the year before. Its operating income, however, rose to $36.1 
million from $34.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company's financial results over the last two years were affected by the 
reorganization it launched in 1987.

PEOPLE: NORTHROP ELIMINATES FIVE EXECUTIVE POSTS; 
</P>
<P>
STREAMLINING DESIGNED TO CUT COSTS, CONCENTRATE RESPONSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop eliminated five executive-level positions Monday and retired or 
reassigned the men who held the jobs in an effort to streamline its 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Two senior vice presidents, Joseph T. Gallagher and C. Robert Gates, will be 
retired within 60 days, the company said. Gallagher is 52 and Gates is 64. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop President Kent Kresa said in a prepared statement that the changes are 
aimed at cutting costs, improving communications and concentrating 
responsibilities in the corporate office. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based aerospace firm disclosed last month that it was 
initiating a reorganization and that it would eliminate 2,500 to 3,000 jobs 
across the company, partly because the firm's workload was declining and partly 
because it wanted to cut its overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
In the executive moves announced Monday, the company also appeared to be 
preparing for Kresa to take the job of chief executive, which will occur by the 
end of the year, when Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones retires as an active 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
Jones characterized the restructuring Monday in an interview as "pruning a tree 
to support the fruit on it." He also said he was seeking to give Kresa "a clean 
ship when he takes over." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continue as Consultant 
</P>
<P>
Gates has been in charge of Northrop's international business, which once 
consisted of F-5 aircraft sales, training services to the Saudi Arabian 
military and a variety of other aircraft service work. Virtually all of that 
has been eliminated or is being sold off. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop said Gallagher, who had carried to title of senior vice president for 
programs, will leave active management but continue as a consultant on advanced 
fighter aircraft development. Northrop is one of two prime contractors 
competing to win a production contract to build the Air Force's advanced 
tactical fighter program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, three vice presidents under Gallagher are losing their positions 
as corporate officers of Northrop. They are Jaime Oaxaca, who is retiring; Lou 
Carrier, who will be reassigned to the firm's aircraft division; and Robert 
Lovell, who will be put on special assignment in the firm's B-2 division. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has experienced sweeping changes in its corporate executive ranks over 
the past year, including the retirements of three other corporate officers and 
the death of a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Welko Gasich and William G. McGagh were retired amid a federal investigation 
last year and John Paterno, who headed the firm's B-2 bomber program, died. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Joseph Yamron, a corporate vice president who headed the firm's 
precision products division, is under federal indictment and has been put on 
leave of absence.

PEOPLE: HASBRO CHIEF'S DEATH SPARKS SALE RUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PROVIDENCE, R.I. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death over the weekend of Stephen D. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief 
executive of Hasbro Inc., raised questions Monday on Wall Street about the 
giant toy company's future. 
</P>
<P>
Hassenfeld, 47, died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest Sunday night at Columbia 
Presbyterian Hospital, where he had been hospitalized for four weeks, Hasbro 
spokesman Wayne Charness said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that within the next year, you will see the company sold. It's an 
attractive property in the industry," said Paul Valentine, an industry analyst 
at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine said he expects that Hassenfeld's family, which owns 13.1% of the 
Pawtucket-based toy maker, eventually would re-examine its position. "With 
Stephen gone and the company now a larger, more bureaucratic organization, the 
fun has probably gone out of this business for the Hassenfeld family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trading Heavy 
</P>
<P>
Valentine estimated that the company could sell for as much as $32 per share, 
perhaps higher if the company performs better than expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro stock closed Monday at $22.25, up 25 cents per share, on the American 
Stock Exchange. Its volume of nearly 1.2 million shares made it the second-most 
heavily traded issue on the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
But, said analyst Walter Kirchberger at PaineWebber Group Inc., "Stephen's 
absence doesn't mean the company is without a leader . . . . That's not to say 
that Stephen won't be missed, but there are competent and qualified people" to 
run the company. 
</P>
<P>
Charness said he did not know when Hasbro directors would meet to select a 
successor. Hasbro President Alan Hassenfeld, 40, who is Stephen Hassenfeld's 
brother, has been running the company in combination with a team of senior 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue as we have for the last month," Charness said. 
</P>
<P>
Hassenfeld built Hasbro into a toy giant, with more than $1.3 billion in sales 
from well-known products that include G.I. Joe, Transformers, My Little Pony 
and Mr. Potato Head. The company's revenue was $102 million 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hassenfeld bought companies, such as Milton Bradley Co. in 1984, and developed 
a diverse line of low-cost products, although the company last year scrapped 
plans for an interactive video and electronic game system called Nemo after 
reportedly spending millions of dollars on research and development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built the Company 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro recently announced that it would acquire assets of financially troubled 
Coleco Industries of Avon, Conn., maker of Cabbage Patch Kids and other toys. 
</P>
<P>
"Stephen Hassenfeld stands out virtually without a peer in the toy industry 
over the past 10 years. He created what I refer to as the modern American toy 
company. A broadly based, well diversified toy company," Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
Hassenfeld, who was born in Providence, joined Hasbro in 1964 and was named 
executive vice president of marketing and elected to the board in 1968. He 
became president in 1974 and chairman in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1987, Hassenfeld was treated, also at Columbia Presbyterian, for what he 
later said was endocarditis, a bacterial infection of the heart valve and 
lining. 
</P>
<P>
His brother said Hassenfeld never fully recovered from the heart infection, 
partly because he was allergic to antibiotics used to treat the illness. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Hassenfeld's illness a month ago prompted heavy trading in Hasbro 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, John T. O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial officer, dismissed 
rumors of a hostile takeover. The Hassenfeld family owns 13.1% of the company 
stock and Warner Communications owns 13.6% in a voting trust controlled by the 
Hassenfeld brothers. Hasbro has the right of first refusal to purchase Warner's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hasbro adopted a "poison pill" earlier this month that would give 
shareholders the right to buy additional stock at an advantageous price in the 
event of a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
HASBRO INC. AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., is a diversified toy manufacturer, one of the 
largest in the world. Among its product lines are Playskool preschool toys, G. 
I. Joe action figures and Milton Bradley board games.

HEFNER WEDDING: STRICTLY TOP HAT, TAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When perennial bachelor Hugh Hefner meets his bride-to-be Kimberley Conrad at 
the altar on Saturday, he won't be wearing pajamas, she won't be in a skimpy 
negligee and there won't be a hidden bunny logo anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The two will be married in an elaborate but traditional ceremony at the Playboy 
Mansion in Holmby Hills, witnessed by 400 guests who will then party the night 
away under a tent of 15,000 yards of white satin twill, inhaling the wafting 
scent of 10,000 white roses, eating imported cheese and smoked fish flown in 
from Europe and dancing to a 25-piece band. 
</P>
<P>
It's all under the control of 27-year-old Colin Cowie, a dapper, tanned former 
model who was brought in (via a Playboy exec who knew his work) a scant five 
weeks ago to organize and cater the affair. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally they were going to do the wedding in-house," he explains in a 
clipped British accent while sitting in his small but tasteful office across 
from the Beverly Center. "There was no real focus as to someone taking control, 
making decisions, getting the ball rolling. I had one interview with Hefner and 
Kimberley, and she said, 'You must go and do what you have to do.' From then it 
was like 24-hour days, preparing the budget, concept and plan, running around 
with swatches of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I must say," he adds, "is it's not at all Hollywood. It's not glitz. 
It's like taking a little piece of Europe and putting it in Beverly Hills for 
eight or nine hours. My background is totally European in terms of 
entertaining, and I think we've come up with a very tasteful and elegant 
ambiance the way the whole thing runs." 
</P>
<P>
Cowie declined to discuss the cost of the wedding, or reveal the guest list 
with the exception of one name on it, Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cowie, guests will enter the mansion from the Mapleton Drive 
entrance (garlanded) after being carefully screened by security. Following 
light drinks and serenading by a string trio in the pool pavilion, they'll be 
escorted to the front lawn and the wishing well, where Hef proposed to Conrad 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
They'll be led to their seats by ushers dressed in uniforms with white tunic 
tops trimmed with gold braid, gold epaulets and brass buttons, while a string 
quartet plays off to the side. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Hefner, wearing a vested tuxedo, will walk to the wishing well 
from the side. Conrad's entrance down the mansion's grand staircase (also 
garlanded) will be heralded by trumpeters playing Jeremiah Clarke's "Trumpet 
Voluntary." It's the same music that filled St. Paul's Cathedral when Princess 
Diana strolled down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, 26, will be given away by her father, Robert Conrad (not the actor), 
and her matron of honor will be her sister, Resa Miller (there are no 
bridesmaids). Hef's best man will be his brother Keith, and the Rev. Charles D. 
Ara will perform the nondenominational ceremony described as traditional, 
meaning there won't be any original vows or recitation of Kahlil Gibran. 
</P>
<P>
The bridal gown was created by New York designer Jim Hjelm, whose gowns 
wholesale for $600 to $2,000. Conrad's is a slightly off-white dress of 
taffeta-style silk with a drop waist and full, gathered skirt. The strapless 
brocade bodice is decorated with pearls and bows. For the ceremony she'll wear 
a jacket with a high neck and sleeves that are puffed at the shoulder and tight 
from the elbow down. The chapel-length train is embroidered with the couple's 
initials, and Conrad will have a short veil with a wreath-style headpiece 
dotted with pearls. Her blond hair will be worn long and slightly curled. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister will wear a rose gown and a wreath-style hairpiece braided with lily 
of the valley. Both bouquets will feature white roses and lily of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony guests will go through the house to the party tent with its 
rug of Astroturf for champagne and canapes before the multicourse buffet dinner 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie describes the buffet set-up as having "elements of change on a regular 
basis." Two buffet tables will be set up on opposite sides of the tent, 
decorated with urns of white roses (the only decorative flower) and busts of 
women on garlanded pedestals (being custom-made in Palm Springs). After each 
course a curtain of white satin twill will be electronically lowered while the 
food and the settings are changed. Ceiling lights will be fitted with different 
color gels to alter the mood as well. Each table, draped in white taffeta with 
a centerpiece of white roses, will have a copy of the menu displayed inside an 
antiqued silver frame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starts With Caviar 
</P>
<P>
For the first course of caviar the top of the buffet will be draped in purple 
satin and accented with purple orchids. Waiters -- wearing those white and gold 
uniforms -- will have matching purple sashes. 
</P>
<P>
The cheese course features imported cheeses flown in from Europe, served on 
sheet of glass that will rest on a bed of real oak leaves. Red wine and port 
will be served alongside. 
</P>
<P>
The fish course will include smoked salmon, smoked halibut and watercress 
salad; the background will be a white trellis laced with ivy. 
</P>
<P>
For the meat course (barbecued boneless lamb, New York steak, grilled baby 
chicken, haricots verts and baby potatoes) the buffet will be draped in red 
satin and gold braiding, there will be bouquets of red roses and waiters will 
have traded their purple sashes for red ones. The backdrop will be a trompe 
l'oeil scene of an "opulent and decadent dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Once again the curtain will descend and then rise on the Viennese dessert table 
trimmed in silver. Diet-busting desserts include a Black Forest torte, 
Pithiviers, opera cake and Napoleons. Cowie has also had Teuscher champagne 
truffles flown in from Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie wanted to end the dinner with cigars and Cognac, but will have to settle 
for just the cognac since the mansion is in a fire zone. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the wedding cake, a five-tier chocolate cake with white 
chocolate icing scrolled on top and a filling of strawberries and whipped 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Wanted Chocolate' 
</P>
<P>
"For me the cake is not the right thing," said Cowie, who prefers the 
traditional dense British fruitcake, of which guests are supposed to take a 
piece and place it under their pillow. "But they wanted chocolate cake so I'll 
give them chocolate cake." He chuckles. "If you stuck chocolate cake under your 
pillow can you imagine what your laundry bill would be?" 
</P>
<P>
When asked if there would be little bride and bridegroom dolls at the top, 
Cowie stops for a moment and stares. "No," he sniffs. "I actually think it's 
corny. I prefer those fresh white roses, you know, those big garden roses that 
open to this size," he says, his hands estimating the circumference of a hefty 
grapefruit. "We're having those flown in from Northern California." 
</P>
<P>
There will be no assigned seating, although the happy couple and their families 
will take the three tables nearest the black-and-white checkerboard dance 
floor. "My concept I think works very well with a California wedding," Cowie 
says. "People are not going to be seated at a formal dinner; they'll get to 
move, to dance. It'll have a very good flow to it." 
</P>
<P>
Cowie, who has planned and catered parties and weddings for socialites, 
celebrities and prominent business people in other parts of the country, Europe 
and Africa, said he'll be working with his own staff along with the Playboy 
Mansion's staff and chefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detailed Instructions 
</P>
<P>
He has mailed out detailed manuals to the crew so there will be nothing left to 
chance. Ushers, for instance, "will know not to wear strong cologne, no jewelry 
and they ought to be suntanned." 
</P>
<P>
Ought to be suntanned? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think people look better when they have a nice glow to their skin." 
</P>
<P>
The wedding will be videotaped as well as photographed, the latter being done 
by former White House photographer and Pulitzer Prize-winner David Hume 
Kennerly. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding and reception are strictly off limits to the media. A two-page 
advisory sent out last week details when photographs, press releases and "video 
news releases" will be available. Playboy personnel are hoping that by allowing 
limited coverage they'll avoid the "Apocalypse Now"-style helicopter invasions 
that occurred at Madonna and Michael J. Fox's weddings. 
</P>
<P>
Cowie's detail-oriented mind has thought of everything, down to having an extra 
pair of shoes a half-size larger on hand for the bride should her feet swell 
during the party. He'll be communicating via a walkie-talkie with his staff the 
day of the wedding to make sure things run smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"Kimberley has wanted to keep it as traditional as possible," he says of the 
Playmate of the Year. "I think she has a good eye for good things, and when she 
sees something that's done in fine taste she recognizes it immediately and will 
respond to it. Hef has a very refined eye for detail as well, and he knows what 
he likes and doesn't like. I tuned right into them, and everything I've 
proposed to do they've given me the go-ahead." 
</P>
<P>
There will be the standard throwing of the garter and the bride's bouquet, and 
the couple will honeymoon at the mansion (Hef is a known homebody). 
</P>
<P>
The one thing Cowie hasn't decided on is a wedding present. "I wanted to 
purchase the Bulgari drinking cups, but someone already purchased other cups 
for them. So I'm back to Square One again. Can you imagine trying to find them 
a wedding present? I've been racking my brain for quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
One thing he does know: After the wedding he's going on a nice, long Caribbean 
vacation.

SALAD DAYS FOR GREENS?;

AS ECOLOGICAL WORRIES MOUNT, A U.S. MOVEMENT TAKES ROOT

EUGENE, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the blues as only a Green could sing them: "the hierarchy, patriarchy, 
eco-destructiveness blues," to be exact. But most of the people spread out on 
the lawn at the University of Oregon here were too busy talking to sing along 
with the young folk singer. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by news of burning rain forests, radioactive air over Chernobyl, and the 
oil Exxon spilled on Alaskan waters, the Green party has suddenly emerged as an 
alternative power source in Europe. And Wednesday, as 250 delegates from 
California and most other parts of the country arrived in Eugene for a five-day 
conference of U.S. Greens, they shared an almost giddy sense that America, too, 
might be poised at one of those rare points in history where radical change -- 
or at least a radical change in thinking -- is possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Who Are the Greens?' 
</P>
<P>
Delegates excitedly reported that with each new ecological disaster come calls 
and letters from people with a vague notion that the Greens have plans for 
harmonizing the human and natural worlds. "Who are the Greens?" the callers 
wonder. "Where do you stand?" 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, after five years of organizing, U.S. Greens themselves aren't 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people in this country who would like for a Green movement 
to happen," said Brian Tokar, 33, a bearded, frizzy-haired caricature of a '60s 
activist and a prominent theorist in a movement that disdains personal 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Greens address the political and economic roots of environmental problems, and 
examine social problems such as poverty and racism as they fit into the natural 
ecology. So "there is a lot of expectation from the public" about what they 
have to offer, Tokar said. But so far, he conceded, U.S. Greens have been 
unable to define themselves clearly. 
</P>
<P>
Are they the Greens who would work only at the grass-roots level, for instance, 
or the Greens who would capitalize on the public's growing concern about the 
environment and launch a national party? Are they the Greens who would come out 
roaring with leftist rhetoric about capitalist oppressors, or those who would 
adopt the inoffensive slogan, "We are neither left or right, but out in front"? 
</P>
<P>
Are they the movement of the '90s or, as one conference participant wondered, 
"just a bunch of leftover hippies?" 
</P>
<P>
Conference-goers who figured those questions could be quickly hammered out in 
smoke-filled rooms had a lot to learn about the painfully gentle process of 
Green-style democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The Greens sprouted as an anti-nuclear, pro-decentralized government movement 
in West Germany in 1979. By most accounts, Green thinking first spread to the 
United States in 1983, when Petra Kelly, an American-educated Green member of 
the German Bundestag returned to this country and made an impassioned pitch for 
Green philosophy on national television. 
</P>
<P>
According to the book, "Green Politics," by Charlene Spretnak and Fritjof 
Capra, in 1984, 64 U.S. Greens met in St. Paul, Minn., and created a system of 
local grass-roots Committees of Correspondence, based on the political units of 
that name during the American Revolutionary War. The gathering also founded a 
national clearinghouse in St. Paul, which remains the focal point of the 
committees' activity. 
</P>
<P>
The German Greens had conceived a broad philosophy based on "four pillars": 
ecology, grass-roots democracy, nonviolence and social responsibility." The 
U.S. Greens added to these a broad statement of "10 Key Values." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, no one at the conference was able to state even a ballpark figure 
for how many Greens there are, noting only that they are active in more than 
200 U.S. locations. 
</P>
<P>
So far that interest has produced negligible political clout, delegates 
conceded. But they take hope from what's happening in Europe -- where Greens 
captured 1,800 city council seats in France in March, and earlier this month 
doubled their seats in the European parliament to 39. 
</P>
<P>
The next step in their evolution here, delegates said, is to develop a more 
unified national platform. Last year a call went out for anyone who was so 
inclined to submit a paper for discussion at this year's conference (although 
for reasons perhaps only a Green can understand, they were called not papers 
but SPAKAS (Strategy and Policy Approaches in Key Areas). 
</P>
<P>
Conference-goers found themselves confronted with more than 200 SPAKAS with a 
staggering variety of broadly and narrowly defined titles such as "The 
Decentralization of Money," "Urban Sprawl Reduction Through Land Value 
Taxation," "Educational Multi-Media Caravans," "Human Relationships and 
Sexuality," "Apartheid," "The Return of Federal Land in the Black Hills to the 
Sioux Nation" and "Homophobia." 
</P>
<P>
So with SPAKAS lumped into 11 basic categories, working groups here dove in to 
debate and then consolidate each batch of papers into a single coherent 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wondered why U.S. Greens have not arrived at a better-defined vision 
in five years had only to watch the SPAKA process. "Domination" in any form is 
abhored. Ask a Green to point out a leader, and they say "everyone here is 
key." Even the 10 key values, a good Green will equivocate, "aren't the 10 
Commandments." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Network' or 'Webwork' 
</P>
<P>
One group spent several minutes debating how many minutes to devote to the next 
brief discussion. Another group grappled with the question of whether 
"networking" or "webworking" was the Greener term. And at a late-night meeting 
of the "left green network," two people complained that the applause awarded 
some remarks somehow undermined the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reiterate the idea that we shouldn't be clapping. . . ," a 
woman said in a quavering voice. "I think it's destructive." 
</P>
<P>
Her contribution received polite applause -- although by later sessions, many 
delegates were expressing themselves with "silent clapping," holding their 
hands in the air and quietly wiggling their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
If the vaunted "process" sometimes struck outsiders as a bit silly, that's only 
because the Greens are among the rare organizations that value openness enough 
to allow observation, several delegates pointed out. After all, who knows what 
those folks in the elephant and donkey hats do behind closed doors? 
</P>
<P>
And this commitment to open democracy is as important to changing the world as 
any specific environmental policy, they said. "One of my highest expectations 
is that we will change the quality of debate in this country," said Daniel 
Moses, the director of Sierra Club books in San Francisco. The recent 
presidential election " . . . was an insult to people who pay attention to the 
issues." Besides, the SPAKA process does work -- if slowly. Under trees, on the 
streets of Eugene, in bars and in restrooms, delegates clustered and talked -- 
prim women in golf garb and long-haired young men who looked as if they'd worn 
the same tie-dyed T-shirt every day since the Summer of Love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Biggest Schism 
</P>
<P>
There are differences among Greens. The biggest schism is between so-called 
Left greens and less politicized Greens, particularly the so-called "spiritual" 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
One evening at the conference, 150 or so activists formed a circle under a blue 
night sky to sing and pound drums and chant quasi-pagan hymns to Mother Earth. 
Another 75 or so met in a dorm lounge and discussed, among other things, 
whether eco-politics and religion mix. 
</P>
<P>
The only major discord, though, occurred during the Saturday plenary session, 
when about 60 young men and women from the Oregon Marijuana Initiative, with 
babies in tie-dyed jumpsuits and a talking parrot in tow, burst into the 
auditorium carrying a 20-foot replica of a marijuana cigarette. Led by a New 
York man who claimed he had been "purged" from the Green movement by "Stalinist 
Greens," they staged a brief sit-down demonstration, chanting: "We smoke pot 
and we like it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Conference organizers diffused the situation by letting the dissident speak. 
The protesters later joined the Greens at a picnic, the scent of their 
intoxicant mixing with the aroma of tofu and other "vegan" that food organizers 
had prepared in deference to their members who eschew eating any meat or animal 
product. 
</P>
<P>
In the forestry working group, more than a dozen people showed up to grapple 
over the SPAKAS. Among them were a stock indexer, two members of the radical 
Earth First! group, a forest scientist who co-founded the West German Green 
party, and a 33-year-old full-time activist who said his parents were about to 
curtail his monthly allowance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Your Favorite Tree' 
</P>
<P>
Also attending was Susan Shaughnessy, a public relations consultant for a 
lumber company near Yosemite, who said her employer had sent her to the 
conference to find out what the Greens were about. As the discussion moved from 
the question "What is your favorite tree?" into more substantive turf, she 
became immersed in the process, debating and synthesizing and even rushing out 
with a corps of volunteers to pound out a statement at the student computer 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had a significant impact on the final report," she said, smiling in 
near disbelief. "They were taking some really radical positions. I got them to 
soften the language." 
</P>
<P>
She was even there when the forestry group held an awkward press conference. 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, forests are the issue. Newspapers may run six or more 
forestry-related stories a day. Courtrooms and government offices resound with 
almost continuous testimony from environmental experts of every stripe. 
</P>
<P>
So, as the delegates lined up to meet the press, the first question, fired by a 
local reporter, echoed the thoughts of many observers: Why in the world add yet 
another voice to the environmental cacophony? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Global Representation 
</P>
<P>
The answer from those at the press conference, and Greens in general, is that 
the movement is the only one that approaches issues from a broad philosophical 
perspective. They are also the only movement, they say, that has a global 
representation, as evidenced by Green activists who showed up from Japan, the 
Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, India and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The old-growth forests of the Western United States are unique in their 
quality and biological diversity and are a treasure of the whole world," said 
Wilhelm Knabe, a co-founder of the West German Green party and current member 
of the Bundestag. "People here don't realize how rare their forests are. The 
U.S. doesn't have the right to misuse them." 
</P>
<P>
As they were read in whole or in part on Saturday before final review on 
Sunday, most of the SPAKAS combined serious proposals for change with more 
idiosyncratic touches. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Justice SPAKA, for example, specifically supported paid maternity 
and paternity leave, leave to care for sick children or other family members, 
and the Roe vs. Wade abortion decision. It also included such statements as: 
"Because of the masculine role in general and the suppression of feelings in 
particular, men by and large lead shorter, less satisfying lives than women." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Basic Right' 
</P>
<P>
Other papers summarized what would appear to be the most basic of Green views. 
That "our ecosystem can no longer support an ideology of perpetual growth and 
consumerism," for instance. That "the health and survival of all life forms is 
interdependent," and that "good health is a basic right for all rather than a 
privilege." 
</P>
<P>
As things wound down, most people seemed ebullient just to have survived the 
marathon decision-making process. Others were frustrated. "It's like practicing 
scales when you want to play music," a delegate from the San Jose area said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, delegates gathered again and voted on all the statements, most of 
which will be refined, rewritten and presented again in Boulder next year -- 
when Greens hope to finally achieve a coherent national platform. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the delegates reached a consensus that they would increase 
their participation in local elections but not run a national slate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
At least a few delegates had hoped for a different decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my feeling that the environment is more important to the future than the 
cold war," said Dorthea O'Neil, who served three terms as a Democrat in the New 
Hampshire state legislature. "It seems to me that a party with the environment 
as the most important part of its platform would have a good chance right now. 
But in some of these SPAKAS they're talking about Utopia. Why waste your time?" 
</P>
<P>
Other Greens warned against impatience. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a long time to purify the ocean and clean up toxic waste dumps," 
said Daniel Moses. "The people who are suffering from these problems aren't 
going to lose interest." 
</P>
<P>
As for Green-style democracy moving slowly, the process itself is as important 
as any results that derive from it, he said. "People sit with us and we hear 
them," he said. "It's not always the person with the sharpest tongue or the 
quickest brain who provides the most wisdom in a discussion." 
</P>
<P>
John Rensenbrink, a professor of politics and ecology at Bowdoin College in 
Maine, said the Green goal is "not just to gain power but to change the way 
power is exercised." 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the way to becoming a serious political opposition in this country," 
he said. "Two years ago, we hadn't learned to walk and talk. Now we walk and 
talk. We're a child, and most people don't take children seriously. But by next 
year, we'll be a youth, and people will be looking at us differently."

<P>
THE CAUTION LIGHT FOR A SUNLESS TAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sounding just like a desperate smoker trying to kick the habit, the woman 
pleads her case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really trying to stay out of the sun," she tells Beverly Hills 
dermatologist Steven Weiss. "I've cut down. But it's summer -- and walking 
around with white, white legs is just too much to bear." 
</P>
<P>
Now she thinks she has found the perfect "fix" -- a "self-tan" lotion that 
darkens skin without the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Indoor tanning isn't new, of course. Coppertone's QT, which debuted in 1960, 
has been a steady seller ever since, a company spokesman claims. But this 
season, several brand-new self-tan products -- some sold at posh department 
store counters -- are giving the old standby some stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of stock in the factory," says Susan Donnelly of Chanel, which just 
introduced its own brand. 
</P>
<P>
In most self-tan lotions, the active ingredient is a tongue-twister substance 
called dihydroxyacetone. "It reacts with the amino acids in the outer layer of 
epidermal cells to change the color," says Frank Akin of Schering-Plough Inc., 
a manufacturer of sunless tanning lotions. 
</P>
<P>
But are indoor tan products safe? The American Cancer Society has taken no 
stand on self-tanning. But Weiss and several other dermatologists tell their 
patients to slather it on -- evenly, or you'll look streaked -- and enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any adverse long-term effects from dehydroxyacetone," says 
Dr. Pearl Grimes, an assistant professor of dermatology at King-Drew Medical 
Center. "The question is -- do the preparations really work? Some patients find 
it gives them a yellowish color." Actually, the boom in self-tan products 
reflects Americans' new willingness to reduce skin cancer risk after years of 
medical preaching. If using self-tan lotion even a little "leads to people 
tanning less in the sun, it's a positive step," says Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone's aglow about indoor tanning. "Very fair-skinned people who 
don't tan in the sun have told us it just doesn't work for them," one 
department store salesman says. And some buyers might cringe at the investment. 
One application lasts about three days. At $12 or more a tube, it could be a 
dark but expensive summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Norplant Report Card 
</P>
<P>
Norplant, an implantable birth control method not yet approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration, gets high marks in a study just published by USC 
researchers in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
Here's their report card: Once implanted in the upper arm, Norplant's six 
silastic capsules release the hormone levonorgestrel and prevent ovulation just 
as effectively as birth control pills. It works for three to five years. It 
doesn't seem to increase the risk of heart disease. And it's reversible. The 
capsules can be removed at any time, using only a local anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is still under review at the FDA, an influentia advisory panel 
recommended approval last April. Norplant could be on the American market by 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The draw? One-shot compliance. "It will appeal most to those who have trouble 
remembering to take the Pill," believes Dr. Edward Savage, chief of gynecology 
at King-Drew Medical Center. Teen-agers will be clamoring for the prescription. 
And Norplant might be a more humane alternative to sterilization for women with 
below average intelligence, suggest Savage. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are downsides. Up to a fifth of Norplant users get headaches. 
And up to 70% have longe menstrual periods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Booze and Health 
</P>
<P>
Heavy drinkers who consume three or more drinks a day may increase their risk 
of stroke while light to moderate drinkers could reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the newest finding of Dr. Arthur Klatsky, chief of cardiology at 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, who has studied the health effects 
of alcohol for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
His results, published this month in the journal, Stroke, are based on a study 
of more than 100,000 patients seen at Kaiser in the early '80s. Patients were 
questioned about their drinking habit and then followed for up to seven years 
to determine if they suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy drinking seems to increase a deadly type of stroke caused by hemorrhaging 
in the brain. On the other hand, moderate alcohol consumption, which is no more 
than two drinks a day, seems to reduce the risk of a more common type of stroke 
caused by blood clots that plug the vessels supplying blood to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Klatsky isn't sure why moderate drinking may protect people, but he speculates 
that the alcohol may decrease the tendency for blood to clot or alternatively 
increase high-density lipoproteins, the so-called good cholesterol believed to 
reduce blockage of blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Drinkers should not interpret the new study as an excuse to imbibe, Klatsky and 
other physicians emphasize. "Consuming alcohol solely to reduce stroke risk 
would not be medically recommended," says Dr. John Moseley, a neurosurgeon at 
St. John's Hospital in Santa 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talented Tenderizer 
</P>
<P>
Picnic time? Beach day? Pack the meat tenderizer along with the first-aid kit, 
suggests Dr. Ricardo Martinez, clinical director of the Stanford University 
Hospital Emergency Department. It can help relieve pain when bees sting or 
jellyfish bite. 
</P>
<P>
"Mix the tenderizer with water and put the paste on the painful spot," Martinez 
suggests. The tenderizer breaks down the protein found in the venom of wasps, 
bees, jellfishes and coral just as it does with meat proteins. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard good things about the tenderizer," says Dr. Alexander Lampone, 
medical director of St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
But it's no cure-all. "Don't count on tenderizer to eliminate the misery of 
mosquito bites," Martinez says.

With a headset cradling his ears and a mike at his lips, former baseball star 
Steve Garvey stepped up to the plate of talk radio before dawn Monday and, when 
he emerged 3 1/2 hours later, not a hair on his gleaming chestnut head appeared 
out of place. For that matter, barely an emotion or an opinion seemed ruffled 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who has had his share of controversy in recent months involving charges 
of two out-of-wedlock paternities, sounded about as smooth and seamless as he 
looked in a fresh white shirt and red tie speckled with figures of tennis 
players. The 40-year-old celebrity, who has been hired to woo the baby-boom 
audience to XTRA-AM by hosting a weekday talk show from 5:30 to 9 a.m., was 
aided by a bevy of friendly, prearranged call-in guests, including Los Angeles 
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, who called him "a wonderful person." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't doing anything at that hour of the morning anyway," Garvey said at 
one point of his early-to-bed, early-to-rise regimen. "It gets your energy 
level up." 
</P>
<P>
If Garvey's voice was low and perhaps a bit tired as he launched "XTRA Morning 
Update with Garvey and Co." at 5:30, within the hour he sounded peppy as he did 
the lead-in for news updates about embattled Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose 
and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's latest "haunting problem with Chappaquiddick." 
(The jury foreman from the 20-year-old case was quoted in Newsweek as saying 
"there was a cover-up" to save Kennedy's political career.) 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, who retired from baseball before the 1988 season after an 18-year 
career as a first baseman with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego 
Padres, said after his first XTRA show that he had "always thought politics 
would be four to six years down the road" once he finished playing baseball, 
and that that ambition still holds. He has expressed interest in seeking the 
Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat. Garvey is also founder and 
chairman of Garvey Marketing Group, a La Jolla-based sports marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this would just be a nice forum for me to express my views and to 
share insights and knowledge," he said of the radio show. ". . . Gosh, this is 
the chance every day for me to start my day with a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
He said the format of the show would be split "60/40" between sports and 
entertainment interviews, and noted that he would like to do on-air profiles of 
"the Kevin Costners, the Emma Samms and the Jane Seymours." 
</P>
<P>
On his first day out, it was mostly baseball and sports that he talked about, 
giving equal time to Lasorda and Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn. But Garvey 
expressed few of his own opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with XTRA sports director Lee Hamilton, for example, who said he 
believes Rose "damaged himself at the gambling tables of America" and compared 
Rose's alleged gambling activities to the Chicago White Sox scandals of 1919, 
Garvey limited himself to asking questions. At one point he asked about the 
value of taking the testimony of "convicted felons" against Rose. But at 
another he noted "how important it is to keep the game clean." And when Lasorda 
had talked about the Reds fans mounting banners at their stadium in support of 
Rose, Garvey simply listened. 
</P>
<P>
When an interviewer later mentioned that it was hard to tell what he really 
felt, Garvey said with a broad grin, "Oh, good," explaining that he intended to 
offer his opinions only when asked. 
</P>
<P>
Off the air, he did just that. Garvey said that if Rose bet on baseball, he 
should be suspended "for a year," but if he bet on his team, he should be 
"banned for a lifetime." He added that there "should be due process." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey also disclosed off the air, in response to a question, that he is the 
father of a San Diego woman's 4-month-old daughter, which had been one of the 
two paternity charges against him. He said he is providing for the child. 
Garvey has two adolescent daughters from his marriage to Cyndy Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment about an alleged paternity involving the pregnancy of an 
Atlanta television editor to whom he had been engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Garvey married interior decorator Candace Thomas, who has 
two daughters from a former marriage. A black Mercedes station wagon, bearing 
plates "Th Garvs," sat at the front of the radio station's building. 
</P>
<P>
If sports was the dominant theme -- including in-studio guest Scott Hamilton, 
an Olympic gold medalist in ice-skating -- Garvey's personal life clearly was 
the program's sub-text. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to Tom Brookshire, a former pro-football player with the Philadelphia 
Eagles and now a sportscaster for all-sports radio station WIP in Philadelphia, 
Garvey said matter-of-factly that "the press takes off on, they take advantage 
of people like us who are straightforward and honest."

BOY PILOT LANDS IN MOSCOW AFTER TIME OFF COURSE

<P>
Eleven-year-old Tony Aliengena arrived to a welcome from enthusiastic Soviet 
schoolchildren and curious airline pilots at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport 
Monday after a blunder by his on-board Soviet navigator sent him briefly off 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake happened while Tony was on approach to the Moscow airport following 
a 400-mile flight from Leningrad, his father, Gary Aliengena, said. The 
navigator, who boarded Tony's plane in Leningrad, provided an erroneous course 
heading for the Moscow airport, sending the child aviator from San Juan 
Capistrano in the wrong direction for about half an hour, Aliengena said. 
</P>
<P>
After discovering the error, the navigator righted the course, said Aliengena, 
who laughed off the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things," Aliengena said at his Moscow hotel room, where 
Tony, his parents and sister were lodged for the five-day stay here. Other 
members of the entourage, however, arrived to find no hotel accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour flight -- Tony's first full day of flying through the Soviet 
Union -- proved otherwise uneventful. After detouring around some 
thunderstorms, Tony landed his father's red, white and blue Cessna 210 
Centurion amid heavy media fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting Tony's single-engine plane were about 75 people including a large 
contingent of Soviet journalists and Moscow children wearing school uniforms. 
After Tony emerged from the cockpit and stretched, he practiced a Soviet 
tradition that follows a safe landing: taking a chunk of bread offered to him 
on the runway apron, dipping it in salt and eating it. 
</P>
<P>
Recording the event was a media crowd so large that even press-savvy Aliengena 
was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"In my life I've never seen so many cameras," Aliengena said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Aliengena family retired to their hotel in high spirits, events were 
developing that could put a damper on Tony's round-the-world trip. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost was a growing indication that Tony will not get the long-sought 
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, to whom he planned to present 
a friendship scroll bearing good-will signatures from more than 250,000 U.S. 
schoolchildren. Instead, it seemed likely that Gorbachev would be kept busy all 
week presiding over the session of the Supreme Soviet, said Sergei Tchermeykh, 
an official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation whose 10-year-old son Roman is 
accompanying Tony around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Tchermeykh said Tony may have to present the scroll to one of Gorbachev's top 
assistants, a meeting tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Gorbachev) is free, he will will meet with him," said Tchermeykh, who 
was among those who turned out to greet the plane. "But I personally doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
Tchermeykh Monday also provided some sobering insight on the rigors of the 
7,000-mile Soviet leg of Tony's trip. He said Tony and his entourage would face 
formidable aviation problems while traveling into the sparsely settled 
countryside in the Soviet far east. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, he said, will be the inability of almost all air-traffic 
controllers in Siberia and the east to speak English. Tony will have to depend 
solely on his on-board Soviet navigator, who also could have problems finding 
his way because there is little radar coverage in the vast terrain through 
which Tony will travel, Tchermeykh said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony also faces the daunting challenge of traversing a high range of mountains 
in the Soviet far east through which no small plane has ever flown, Tchermeykh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very difficult project," said Tchermeykh, who plans to accompany Tony 
on the trip. "But I think and say it is possible." 
</P>
<P>
A more pressing difficulty confronted the nine Americans in Tony's entourage 
when they arrived in Moscow only to discover none had hotel reservations. The 
Americans had been told that the reservations had been made by the Soviet 
Foundation for Social Invention, an agency which is sponsoring Tony's trip 
through the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation representatives instead hustled the weary and confused Americans 
aboard a bus and parceled them out to the homes of various Moscow residents who 
volunteered their help. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of accommodations angered some of the Americans, and the anger boiled 
over when a foundation representative began collecting passports and visas from 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where I'm going, I don't know what I'm doing, and now you take my 
passport," Julia Roberson, a member of a Los Angeles-based film crew 
accompanying Tony, snapped at one of the foundation representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials said they would try to place Americans at local hotels for 
the rest of the week. In the meantime, they are staying with people such as 
Arthur Bouchara, a 23-year-old postgraduate student who opened his one-bedroom 
apartment in suburban Moscow to this reporter and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unexpected from me because I learned about you only two hours ago," 
said Bouchara. Like many of the other host families, Bouchara is a member of 
the Moscow World Family Club, a group devoted to facilitating international 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
And like the other hosts, Bouchara seemed thrilled to share his home. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good that you come from your home in America to our home here to see how 
we live. We are very honored to have you," he said in English at his mother's 
apartment next door, where she prepared a hearty meal of beef, potatoes and 
salad for her hungry guests. 
</P>
<P>
Later this week in Moscow, Tony will be putting on public display a Soviet 
friendship scroll that he was given in Leningrad to carry across the country. 
Between 150 and 200 children in Leningrad already have signed the scroll, which 
is to be presented to President Bush upon Tony's return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is scheduled to resume his trip Saturday morning with a flight to 
Kuibyshev.

O.C. SOLDIER LED UNUSUAL LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
PERI AS SPY: UNBELIEVABLE TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While living with his family in South Africa, Michael Peri carried the U.S. 
flag for a drill team founded by his mother, a group of uprooted American 
teen-agers who called themselves the Patriettes. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other youths living in the expatriate colony about 100 miles 
northeast of Johannesburg, Peri became protective of all things American. He 
was so concerned that the nasal Afrikaner clip would creep into his U.S. 
accent, a family friend recalled, that the California native acquired a Texas 
twang. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, the same young man who struggled to retain his American 
identity has admitted betraying his country. Spec. Michael A. Peri, an 
intelligence analyst for the Army, pleaded guilty to espionage and was 
sentenced on Saturday to 30 years in a military prison. 
</P>
<P>
Once considered a model soldier, Peri was described by Army prosecutors during 
his court-martial as a "Judas" who acted on his spy fantasies by slipping into 
East Germany with U.S. military secrets and giving away the store. 
</P>
<P>
The picture that has emerged of the young soldier since he returned from the 
Eastern bloc nation and surrendered in West Germany is unfamiliar to those who 
thought they knew him best. Family friends and military buddies expressed 
disbelief that the Michael Peri they knew could become a foreign agent, if only 
for a confused, brief moment. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good, wholesome kid who went into the Army because he was looking for 
direction," said Linda Later, a Salt Lake City publisher who became close 
friends with the Peri family while living in South Africa. Later recently 
helped line up defense attorneys for the accused soldier. "I can't believe that 
he would do this. I can't accept it at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Authorities at a Loss 
</P>
<P>
Peri's disappearance was also baffling to officials of the 11th Armored Cavalry 
Regiment in Fulda, West Germany, where Peri had been stationed. The young 
soldier, described as well-liked and highly trusted, left behind a new Honda 
Civic, a stereo, skis and clothing when he fled to East Germany with a laptop 
computer and military secrets last Feb. 20. He returned and surrendered 12 days 
later, but even after his court-martial, authorities are at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The question we have never been able to answer is why," said Sgt. Major Dale 
McInnis, spokeswoman for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany. Peri has not been 
accessible by the media since his return from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, described by friends as an average American kid, led an international 
childhood that was anything but typical. The second of Fred and Winnie Peri's 
three children, Michael spent his early years in a middle-class neighborhood of 
La Habra. But Fred Peri's career as a project engineer for Fluor Daniels Corp., 
an international firm based in Irvine, soon took the family all over the globe. 
They moved eight times before Michael turned 20. 
</P>
<P>
The family lived for about three years in South Africa while Fred Peri worked 
on the construction of a refinery, according to Later, whose husband also 
worked for Fluor Daniels there. Young Peri and his sister, Desiree, traveled to 
Austria to attend the Salzburg International Preparatory School in 1981-82 and 
then returned to South Africa to enroll in Evander High Sc hool the following 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Another job transfer took the Peris back to Orange County in 1983, and 
additional house moves caused Michael to switch from Fountain Valley High 
School to La Quinta High School in Westminster before graduating with mediocre 
grades in 1983. Michael Peri joined the Army Reserves and, after completing a 
two-year tour, moved briefly with his family to a Chicago suburb. In 1987, 
after his parents returned to California and began construction on a house in 
Laguna Niguel, Peri entered active duty and qualified for an elite intelligence 
training course. 
</P>
<P>
California, Africa, Europe -- to many it might sound like a glamorous life. But 
it was a difficult path for a shy young man, and one that his parents 
apologized for during wrenching testimony at Peri's sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not my Michael," Fred Peri told a military jury. "He's a quiet, 
unassuming young man. He's been under a lot of stress. Maybe when we raised 
him, we didn't teach him how to deal with stress. We insulated him." 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Peri described her turbulent childhood in an alcoholic family and said 
that, as a result, she had been overprotective of her children. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we did spoil our children," she testified. "We helped them along the 
way. I didn't have possessions when I grew up. I wanted them to have it better 
than I had it. We've given them an opportunity not to grow up, not to mature. I 
see that might be wrong now." 
</P>
<P>
Peri said that he made an impulsive mistake when he crossed into East Germany 
with a computer and four floppy discs that contained details of U.S. troop 
movements in West Germany and Army estimates of Soviet military strength. He 
complained that he felt overworked and unappreciated in his job as an 
intelligence specialist for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda. 
</P>
<P>
And, as he pleaded for forgiveness, Michael Peri the red-blooded American 
appeared again. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't think I have remorse for what I've done," Peri said, crying. "But 
I'm willing to join combat arms . . . and put my life on the line in a 
front-line unit during the war." 
</P>
<P>
To Sean Regan, who served with Peri in a Los Alamitos Army Reserve unit from 
1985 to 1987, the combat offer reflected Peri's early patriotic enthusiasm. 
Regan, who is no longer a reservist, was a junior noncommissioned officer 
assigned to help train Peri in intelligence analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good guy, and he really seemed to enjoy the work we were doing," said 
Regan, of Westminster. "When you're dealing with national security and you get 
your (security) clearance, you get something that only 2% of the country can 
get." 
</P>
<P>
But, Regan noted, working for a "glorious unit on the front lines," such as the 
11th Armored Cavalry, "can go to your head." 
</P>
<P>
"You're planning war, and moving tanks and troops. It's a game, it's like 
chess. To me, that's very exciting, and that's how Mike felt too." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in March, Peri's uncle, Bob Andre of La Habra, also recalled 
the young soldier's interest in intelligence work. Michael Peri had spoken 
during a visit home last December of pursuing a career with the CIA, Andre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he was going to put his time in military intelligence and 
after he came out, he was going to go back to college," Andre said. "Then, with 
his background in intelligence, he was going to apply for a job with the CIA." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors depicted Peri as a cunning young man whose fantasies of espionage 
and intrigue were fueled by a magazine article that Peri read three days before 
his flight. Peri seemed fascinated with the story, about the Marine spy scandal 
at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and bragged to friends about his high-level 
security clearance, according to Maj. Michael Graham, the lead prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the proverbial fox in the chicken house," Graham said. "He violated the 
trust his unit had placed in him. And like Judas betrayed Jesus at the Last 
Supper, Specialist Peri kissed off his friends, kissed off his family, kissed 
off his unit and kissed off his country." 
</P>
<P>
A jury panel of five officers deliberated only two hours before returning with 
a sentence of 30 years in prison. According to the terms of a plea agreement, 
Peri's sentence will be reduced by 5 years if he serves his first three years 
in prison with good behavior. At the earliest, Peri could be paroled in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"That kid was working 100 hours a week over there in a highly stressful job 
with nobody he could talk to," said Michael A. Martinson of Brea, who has known 
the Peri family since they were neighbors in La Habra in 1963 and described 
Michael as like his own son. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Army made an example of him, and I find it impossible to believe 
that he did what they say he did. Up until the last, I was hoping that he would 
be exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
Later, who has been in daily contact with Fred and Winnie Peri, described the 
parents as "numb" following the sentencing. And although Later described Peri's 
decision to go to East Germany as "a screw-up; 22-year-olds screw up," she 
insisted that the soldier is no spy. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, Mike's on the klutzy side," she said. "If I were on a mission and 
Mike were on a mission, I'd worry about him screwing up. Not about being loyal 
-- just making a mistake."

10-MILE IRVINE-TO-BEACH TRAINING HIKE STARTLES SUBURBANITES 
</P>

<P>
Groggy from a late night at work, Patricia Holland of Irvine said she struggled 
through her morning run along San Diego Creek in her hometown Monday, barely 
able to keep her eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
Until she was surrounded by Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like something out of a movie," said Holland, who is more used to 
dodging bicyclists and jeering motorists. "All of a sudden I was faced with 
advancing troops. It was quite intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
But the Marines reservists meant no harm. Instead, more than 70 of them -- 
wearing camouflage uniforms, field packs and boots -- trekked from Irvine to 
Corona del Mar State Beach during a rush-hour training hike. While the march 
startled some civilians, it was intended only to show Orange County that the 
part-time Leathernecks are still rough and ready. 
</P>
<P>
The troops marched in twos past swank office parks and pricey homes on 
palm-lined streets, a 3 1/2-hour jaunt that made for good exercise -- even if 
it didn't resemble wartime conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"This route shows the civilian community our training to maintain a 
combat-ready status," said Lt. Col. D.J. Kingsbury, commander of the Marine 
Aircraft Group 46, a reserve unit based at the Marine Corps Air Station in El 
Toro. Smiling after the hike, he said: "Besides, it was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
The unit -- a mixture of men and women who usually spend their days as postal 
workers, bankers, aerospace engineers, college students and the like -- trains 
one weekend a month and two consecutive weeks in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The rare tour through residential and business neighborhoods began at 6:30 a.m. 
at Jeffrey Road in Irvine, continuing on bike paths along San Diego Creek and 
later past UC Irvine. The unit then marched on sidewalks or road shoulders down 
MacArthur Boulevard and San Joaquin Hills Road in Newport Beach before turning 
onto Marguerite Avenue to reach the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the troops got some strange looks, but Marines reported that 
people waved and honked horns in support. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blast," said Lance Cpl. Dwight Brumbaugh. "There were a lot of eyes 
looking at us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who watched the procession, led by a pair of soldiers wearing 
fluorescent-orange vests and followed by a small troop truck, said the troops 
cut a strange figure marching among Mercedeses and tank-topped joggers. 
</P>
<P>
John Hamilton, who was visiting a friend on San Joaquin Hills Road, looked 
surprised as the Marines trudged by. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I got through with this sort of stuff a long time ago," said 
Hamilton, a World War II veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Holland, made parallels to movies. "'One minute I'm riding along. 
The next thing I know, it's 'Platoon,' " said Jan Ellison of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Although these recreational marches are not common outside the county's 
military bases, it is up to each individual unit whether to schedule them for a 
change of pace, said Marine spokeswoman Cpl. Sharon Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
While hiking, the troops sang or whistled a few marching songs. 
</P>
<P>
But as they neared their goal, they began chanting with vigor. "They were 
grunting some Marine talk or something," said Dave Vistaunet, a parking 
attendant at Corona del Mar State Beach who watched the soldiers file down 
Marguerite Avenue and into the park. "We were wondering what they were doing. 
We were going to charge them for parking -- they got four spots," he added, 
joking.

<P>
Beach-area residents said the troop movement made them uneasy at first. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared me to death. I didn't know what they were doing," said Linda Easter, 
who operates a Marguerite Avenue day-care center from her home. "It was neat, 
though. At first I thought we were getting into trouble. I mean, with all that 
(is) going on nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
Children at the center met the troops and, in a role reversal, gave out 
high-fives and candies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised and scared, like there was a war or something," said Megan 
Stolte, 8. 
</P>
<P>
After the hike ended at the beach, the troops got out of their boots to relax. 
A few of the reservists changed into swim suits. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a simple walk to the beach," said Lt. Col. Ken Derry, a 14-year reserve 
veteran, sipping a Coke after the group reached its goal. Even though some 
troops were rubbing their sore feet, it could have been worse, Derry said. "We 
could have gone to Camp Pendleton," the Marine base in San Diego County, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Dana Marshall said the walk reminded him of pictures he saw of 
German soldiers marching through European cities during World War II. "I was 
glad we were only training," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
One reserve spoke of another relief. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the best part of the hike, Gunnery Sgt. Bob Martinez pointed 
to where the hike ended. "It was when we stopped over here," he said, digging 
into lunch.

</P>
<P>
KILLING OF YOUTH NOT GANG-RELATED, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder of a 17-year-old Fullerton youth on the streets of an exclusive 
hillside neighborhood was probably not gang related, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Cecil Reece said the motive for the attack on Vernon Morris Carter III 
and a companion, Arthur Rodriguez Jr., was the result of drug buy gone sour 
early Sunday. Carter and Rodriguez apparently went to the quiet neighborhood in 
the 1400 block of Vista del Mar expecting to buy some marijuana in a 
prearranged deal. Instead, they were beaten and robbed by a group of 
assailants. 
</P>
<P>
Carter died later at UCI Medical Center in Orange from several stab wounds, and 
Rodriguez remained at the same hospital Monday night in critical condition, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Four suspects, including a 16-year-old boy, have been arrested in connection 
with the case. Reece said that no bail has been set for any of the suspects and 
that no court hearings have been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives spent much of Monday searching for a gang-connection in the case. 
But, Reece said, it appears "that this is a case of a drug buy gone bad. . . . 
It's doubtful that this had anything to do with gangs." He added that police 
are uncertain whether either victim belonged to a gang.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
ARRAIGNMENT IN INFANT'S DROWNING IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arraignment of two North Tustin women charged with failing to obtain a 
day-care license after a pool accident left a toddler dead was delayed Monday 
while the defendants sought to have the case against them dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanor charges were lodged last month against Carol Brooks and her mother, 
Diane Brooks, for the alleged violation of the state's health and safety code. 
The complaint followed a March 30 accident at their home day-care center in 
which 14-month-old Arthur M. Griese died and two other children were seriously 
injured when they toppled into the pool. The Brookses were not licensed as 
day-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Deborah Barnum said that before a new July 17 
arraignment date, she plans to argue in a court motion that the drowning should 
be best dealt with in civil litigation, rather than under criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The Brookses' failure to obtain a day-care license "is not a crime in 
California," Barnum said in an interview. "To take a bad situation, a tragic 
accident, and make it into a crime is very sad." 
</P>
<P>
The two women appeared in Municipal Court in Santa Ana for the scheduled 
arraignment but declined to speak with reporters.

FIRE DAMAGES HOME; WOMAN ESCAPES UNHURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving fire heavily damaged a home Monday, but a woman at first believed 
to be trapped inside escaped unhurt, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed much of the garage and kitchen area of the home in the 14800 
block of Yarborough Street, Westminster Fire Department Battalion Chief Don 
Herr said. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out about 3:40 p.m., a woman who was in the kitchen 
apparently made her way safely out a back door to a nearby school. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze's cause remained under investigation. Damage to the residence was 
estimated at $100,000, fire officials said.

CHAMBER OUTLINES PLAN FOR NEW BUSINESS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for a center to help businesses are among the new fiscal year goals of 
the South Orange County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Crockett, president of the newly renamed chamber, which is based in Laguna 
Hills, said Monday that the organization wants to establish a South Orange 
County Center for Economic Development. "It would be something to help our 
existing businesses expand and do the things they want to do, and also a center 
to help new businesses that want to come into south Orange County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett said other goals of the chamber will be to continue to seek federal 
relief from some recent changes in the federal income tax law that have caused 
problems and confusion for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The organization was formerly known as the Saddleback Regional Chamber of 
Commerce, and its new name becomes effective Saturday, coinciding with the 
beginning of a new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber installed officers at its recent dinner-dance at the Irvine Hilton 
and Towers. George Walsh of San Clemente is the chamber's new chairman of the 
board, and Elaine Carter of Coto de Caza is chairwoman-elect.

O.C. OFFICIALS REMINDED OF PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elected officials often make a promise, form a committee or pass a resolution, 
figuring that will take the steam out of public pressure on an issue. But they 
are learning not to do that with Orange County Congregation-Community 
Organizations, a group of members of 15 churches. The parishioners have banded 
together in a grass-roots effort to cope with Orange County's growing drug 
problem and, as part of the process, to make local government try harder to 
cope with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, congregations from churches and synagogues in Anaheim and Santa Ana 
were given what sounded to them like commitments by the Santa Ana and Anaheim 
city councils to launch a coordinated effort to help eradicate drugs. Both 
councils then passed resolutions declaring that a drug epidemic exists in the 
community. The County Board of Supervisors also adopted the drug resolution 
proposed by the church group. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Monday, several hundred parishioners followed up on their initial 
effort by asking Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter what action the city had taken since 
making its anti-drug commitment in April. Some complained that there was still 
no action taken against drug dealers in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor acknowledged that there had been little activity since last April and 
said that he planned to meet with the police chief and city attorney. Hunter 
also pledged a clampdown on drug dealers operating out of businesses or homes 
and said he would report back in two weeks on what progress he was making in 
seeking stepped up enforcement and more money for anti-drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
We suspect that the church group will keep the pressure on the councils and 
will return in the not-too-distant future to ask for yet another accounting. At 
that session, the parishioners will no doubt be less inclined to accept pledges 
and promises as substitutes for real progress.

STUDY ASKED ON OFFICIAL'S OCTC CONSULTING CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staff of the Orange County Transportation Commission was asked Monday to 
verify that a Newport Beach city councilman has actually earned $10,000 that 
the OCTC paid him under a recent consulting contract. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who is also chairman of the County Board of 
Supervisors, asked for the study involving Councilman John C. Cox Jr. during 
Monday's OCTC meeting in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied that Mr. Cox has earned his bread and butter, but in the 
interest of the reputation of John Cox and the reputation of this commission, I 
felt we should take a look at it," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Some commission members were surprised last week to learn of Cox's contract, 
although Riley said he had known about it from OCTC Executive Director Stanley 
T. Oftelie for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Oftelie told The Times that he had hired Cox as a consultant to 
help achieve a consensus among the county's 28 cities on the OCTC's 20-year 
plan for transportation improvements, which would be funded partly by a 
proposed half-cent sales tax, and to relay any concerns raised by city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said Monday: "I am worth what they pay me." He acknowledged that he never 
lobbied some officials about OCTC's 20-year plan but added: "I'm also an 
adviser to OCTC. Quite frankly, I had to be careful not to be labeled as a spy 
for OCTC." Former Fountain Valley Councilman Al Hollinden performed a similar 
function for OCTC in 1984, when OCTC sponsored a 1-cent sales tax measure that 
was defeated overwhelmingly by voters.

Ronald Reagan will return to his former job on July 11 -- describing baseball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The former President will do one inning of color commentary during NBC's 
telecast of the All-Star game on July 11 at Anaheim Stadium, the network 
announced Monday. Reagan will join regular announcers Vin Scully and Tom 
Seaver. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan broadcast Iowa football in 1932 for WOC radio in Davenport, Iowa. One 
year later, he shifted to WHO, an NBC affiliate in Des Moines, Iowa, and for 
five seasons did re-creations of Chicago Cubs games based on written 
descriptions provided over Western Union wires. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan did 1 1/2 innings of color commentary last Sept. 30 during a visit to 
Wrigley Field. He joined announcers Harry Caray and Steve Stone.

SHOTPUTTER BLUTREICH BATTLES AGAINST INJURIES, SELF-DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Blutreich still holds the Orange County high school records in the 
shotput (69 feet 6 1/2 inches) and the discus (210-8) by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
He set them in 1985, during his senior year at Capistrano Valley High School. 
That was the year everything went right, the year he received a plaque for four 
years of perfect attendance, the year he took the homecoming queen to the 
senior prom, the year he received his second All-American award in track and 
field. 
</P>
<P>
He was a sure shot to excel in college. Track powers UCLA, USC, Arizona State, 
Arkansas, Texas and Southern Methodist wooed him. He chose UCLA and arrived 
with high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
He was redshirted his first year at UCLA and, competing for the Santa Monica 
Track Club, set a national 19-and-under record in the shotput with a throw of 
63-5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't put the shot that far since. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his season with Santa Monica, the shot, his favorite event, 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"The shot slipped out of my hand and I basically pushed it out with one 
finger," Blutreich said. "It was not a good sight. They said I tore ligaments." 
</P>
<P>
"He basically was the leading thrower in the world for the juniors at age 19 
right before he injured his hand," said Art Venegas, UCLA's throwing coach. 
Venegas said the injury made Blutreich throw tentatively. Instead of generating 
power by snapping the shot with his wrist and fingers, he began guiding the 
shot, Venegas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The shot is a very unforgiving implement," said Blutreich's father, Len, who 
helped coach Brian in high school and who threw the discus for Cal State Los 
Angeles and competed in the 1960s for the Southern California Striders amateur 
track club. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you are generating speed through the spin, generating all these forces 
that all come out through the wrist and hand, and you know some pain is coming 
at the end of that, so you try to modify your form a little bit so as to try to 
not have as much pain." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich did reinjure the hand during his first season of competition at UCLA, 
making his first two seasons of competition at UCLA a struggle from which he is 
only now beginning to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
But as he competed through pain for two years, Blutreich began to doubt 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit rock bottom," Venegas said. "I mean the kid was absolutely destroyed 
his freshman and sophomore years. He started to rise his junior year," which 
ended this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Based around the injury he just felt like, 'God, I can't produce.' He used to 
be a major part of the program and now he felt like he was just hanging on." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich describes the period as "just a very tough time. My teammates, who I 
came in with, were all making the Olympic team and going to Europe and 
competing, and it was just very tough on me not doing what I was capable of 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're hurt throwing the shot, your legs don't do what they are supposed 
to do. . . . Last year I really thought about quitting the sport. I had the 
phone in my hand and I was ready to call coach and say, 'Hey, I'm not having 
fun; I just want to quit.' Obviously I didn't make the call." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he talked with friends and did some soul-searching on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to think what life would be like without the sport and basically 
decided I had to keep going because I never quit." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich is a perfectionist by nature. He was awarded plaques for perfect 
attendance in junior high and high school and earned the arrow of light, the 
highest honor in Cub Scouts in Mission Viejo Troop 704. His bedroom is covered 
with medals, trophies and plaques for his athletic and other accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of pressure on you to do well," Blutreich said. "They give you 
a scholarship and expect a lot of big things out of you and you don't produce. 
A lot of pressure is there from the outside and inside." 
</P>
<P>
Said Venegas: "I don't think he had a lot of pressure from outside people. His 
family is very low-key and very supportive. Here at UCLA, though, you have very 
high-level people like Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The pressure has been more Brian's 
pressure. He is very demanding of himself. But that is what makes him a good 
athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich is a solid 6-foot-5 1/2, 280 pounds, helped in part by an extensive 
weight-training program he started in junior high under coach Dave Elecciri, 
now football coach at San Clemente. Because he has a frame that he has to fold 
to fit into the front seat of his Mustang, some people think Blutreich uses 
drugs such as steroids or human growth hormones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People always ask me, 'So what are you taking?' I say I'm taking pizza," 
Blutreich said. 
</P>
<P>
But he was not so nonplussed about such queries when he was injured and 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
"You throw far and people have to come up with some excuse on how you did it," 
he said. "When I wasn't doing well, everyone started saying, 'Oh, he's not 
taking his drugs.' At first I felt a lot of hatred and bitterness. But I 
learned how to deal with it. I did a lot of growing up during that time. I 
definitely matured a lot." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how bad things got, Blutreich said he never considered taking 
steroids because he is a Christian, and because he did not want to embarrass 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
"It (steroid use) is crazy," he said. "It defeats the whole purpose of sport. I 
never took the drugs probably because of my family. I'm an only child and my 
parents mean a lot to me, and they sure wouldn't approve of it." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich says he's looking forward to a new policy that goes into effect July 
1, in which The Athletic Congress has authorized random drug testing of the top 
25 competitors in each discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich's comeback began when he finished third in the discus with a throw of 
188-6 at the 1988 NCAA outdoor championships. "That was the motivation he 
needed to move on," Venegas said. 
</P>
<P>
"(This year) at the Pac-10 championships and the NCAA championships, he began 
to show signs of the Brian of old with a lot of snap in his wrist where he put 
pressure on his hand again." 
</P>
<P>
Blutreich won the Pac-10 title in the discus last month with a throw of 195-0. 
He placed third in the shot at the NCAA indoor meet in Indianapolis in March 
with a throw of 60-0 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
In the NCAA outdoor championships in Provo, Utah, this month, he placed third 
in the shot (61-9) and fourth in the discus (189-0) despite an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, he went to the Tucson Invitational in Arizona and threw a 
lifetime best (199-8) in the discus, the fourth-best mark in UCLA history. 
</P>
<P>
But while warming up for the shot, he severely sprained his ankle, causing him 
to miss last weekend's The Athletic Congress national championships in Houston. 
He had thrown the shot 62-8 in the qualifying rounds before the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He has had some bad luck with injuries, there is no doubt about it," Venegas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His bad luck hasn't run out yet. He is taking off a month or so from training 
while he recovers from surgery that removed a cyst from his back. 
</P>
<P>
"Now what he has to do is overcome that fear and really start attacking his 
throw and I predict he can throw the shot 66 feet next year and the discuss 210 
feet," Venegas said. 
</P>
<P>
(Mike Buncic of the University of Kentucky holds the NCAA record in the discus 
at 217-11, set in 1985. UCLA's John Brenner holds the shot record at 71-11 1/4, 
set in 1984.) 
</P>
<P>
"He has a very good shot at being rated No. 1 in the shot and discus his senior 
year in college and that is a natural progression," Venegas said. "He has 
talent enough that if he becomes motivated and gets the financial support, he 
could be an Olympian."

NEWPORTER RESORT WILL BECOME A HYATT, UNDERGO RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Newporter Resort near Fashion Island in Newport Beach will become the Hyatt 
Newporter next month, the hotel chain said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt Hotels Corp. was one of the last major chains without a hotel to manage 
in the booming Costa Mesa/Newport Beach/Irvine area around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt will replace Westgroup, a Los Angeles hotel management company, on July 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's owner, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Beverly Hills, said it 
would spend more than $4 million over the next three years to refurbish the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the thrift said it switched to Hyatt because of the chain's 
"very strong national recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia may also have considered Hyatt's marketing expertise, hotel experts 
said, especially in attracting business meetings to Hyatt hotels. Local 
competition for the lucrative meetings business is intense. 
</P>
<P>
The 410-room Newporter -- at 1107 Jamboree Road -- once had little competition 
in the local hotel market: Built in 1962 as a resort, for much of the 1960s it 
was the only upscale hotel in the Newport Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time Columbia bought it for $26 million in 1985, the hotel had been 
sold several times and business had been falling off, Westgroup said in 1985 as 
it took over management of the hotel for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The competition has only gotten stiffer since: In the last five years, the 
Newporter has had to square off against a pair of new oceanfront resorts: the 
Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point and the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
And developers have built a number of hotels for business travelers among the 
mid-rise office buildings in the Newport Beach/Costa Mesa/Irvine area. One 
reason: An adjacent hotel makes these developer's office buildings more 
attractive to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
So intense is the competition for guests in those cities now that some surveys 
put the average hotel occupancy rate in the range of 65%, a little better than 
last year, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take another year or two to get healthier," said Jim Burba, a 
consultant at accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster's Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
With those kinds of numbers, it's unlikely that many new hotels will be built 
soon near the airport, experts say. Only one big hotel opened in the area last 
year; only one will open this year. Both are Marriott all-suite hotels. For 
Hyatt, that's one advantage of operating the Newporter: The chain can get a 
foothold in the market without waiting for a developer to build a new hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say developers planning new hotels in the area are probably also 
courting Hyatt, which has a reputation as one of the nation's better hotel 
chains. Some of them may yet get their wish: Once the latest wave of new hotels 
is filled up, the experts said, the airport market will probably be busy enough 
to accommodate another Hyatt. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the chain has talked to some of the county's biggest developers 
-- the Irvine Co., Koll Co., Mola Development Co. -- about managing their new 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, Hyatt has moved at a deliberate pace in Orange County. The chain 
operates only a hotel across the street from Disneyland in Anaheim and the 
Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden Grove, which Hyatt took over in 1987 from the 
Princess hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Chicago-based Hyatt operates 23 hotels and resorts in California. 
It began in the state in 1957 with a hotel at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The company says it remains interested in possible new opportunities in Orange 
County. A spokesman noted that when Hyatt opened an office to scout new deals 
on the West Coast about a year and a half ago, it put the office in Orange 
County.

EMULEX CORP. CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDING DESPITE SLUGGISH BUSINESS

Emulex Corp. has run out of room at its Harbor Boulevard headquarters in Costa 
Mesa and is erecting a new structure nearby to provide some breathing space for 
its 600 Orange County employees. 
</P>
<P>
The computer products company plans to move its administrative offices into the 
new building when it is completed in early 1990. The 80,000-square-foot, 
two-story facility is under construction at the corner of Harbor and Sunflower 
Avenue in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The firm currently operates out of a 214,000-square-foot facility that houses 
its engineering, manufacturing, marketing and administrative operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely crowded right now," a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Emulex said it will go ahead with the building despite its recent 
acknowledgment that business has been sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, the company said earnings for its fourth quarter ended June 2 
will be lower than the $2.8 million reported in the same quarter in 1988. 
Revenue is expected to be between $35 million and $37 million, up from $34.2 
million in the 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Emulex, which makes computer storage devices and data communications equipment, 
said that competition in its market has become "less favorable" and that sales 
to a major customer will be about $2 million below earlier forecasts.

SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is owned primarily by ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., 
posted record net income of $3.8 million for its second quarter ended May 31. 
That represents a 27% increase from the $3 million reported for the same period 
last year. Sales in the quarter rose 10% to $30.3 million from $27.5 million. 
For the first half, net income totaled $6.4 million, 47% higher than the $4.4 
million posted a year earlier. Sales increased 17% to $59.9 million from $51.1 
million. The Costa Mesa-based pharmaceutical products manufacturer said sales 
growth in its international operations, particularly in Mexico, contributed to 
the second-quarter gains.

RAUB QUITS AS CHORALE CONDUCTOR AT ORANGE COAST AFTER 19 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 19 years at the job, Richard Raub is stepping down as conductor of the 
Orange Coast (College) Chorale. However, he will continue to conduct the Orange 
Coast Singers, a smaller ensemble, and will remain as a full-time voice and 
choral instructor at the Costa Mesa college. 
</P>
<P>
Raub, who will be out of town until mid-July, could not be reached for comment. 
His resignation was confirmed Monday by Ted Baker, OCC's dean of fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Raub will conduct four concerts with the Orange Coast Singers: a 
Haydn program Oct. 21 at the college; a program of seasonal favorites Dec. 17 
at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Tustin; a Bach program March 10, 1990, at the 
college, and a program to be announced May 5 at St. Paul's. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over the chorale will be Ted Reid, who will conduct a program of Bach, 
Brahms and Vaughan Williams, plus seasonal selections, on Dec. 9; and 
Mendelssohn's "Elijah" on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Reid will teach the course "Masterworks Chorale," from which the membership of 
the Orange Coast Chorale is drawn, next year at the college, according to 
Baker. Classes will begin the week of Aug. 21.

THEATER AND FILM / JAN HERMAN: AS GEORGES SEURAT'S MODEL-LOVER, SHE CONNECTS 
THE EMOTIONAL DOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She had spent the day laying Mexican tile on the kitchen floor of her tiny 
Hollywood fixer-upper, and now she is backstage at South Coast Repertory 
revving up for her real job with a cup of day-old coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh! Not bad," says Sally Spencer, evincing the same keep-your-chin-up style 
that will serve her well later that night as the leading lady in "Sunday in the 
Park With George." 
</P>
<P>
To play Dot, who is both a painter's model and the mistress of the title 
character, the strawberry-blond actress must suggest deep drafts of humor and 
patience not usually given to a headstrong woman faced by a lover's neglect. At 
the same time, she must project a desperate passion while vaulting through a 
Stephen Sondheim score that director Barbara Damashek has called "the vocal 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
That Spencer, 34, brings all this off as well as Bernadette Peters -- who 
originated the role in the 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning musical on Broadway -- 
testifies to an exceptionally winning talent. It also may owe as much to 
Spencer's less steely conception of the role than Peters brought to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to show that there's really a good relationship between Georges and 
Dot," she says. "They have their problems, but they love each other. So I try 
to find places early in the show where the audience can see this. Otherwise, 
the conflict between Georges' feelings for Dot and his love for his work 
doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, wearing a print dress, is sitting in the theater's Green Room two 
hours before the curtain. The sound of Harry Groener doing vocal warm-ups for 
his role as 19th-Century painter Georges Seurat wafts through the hallway. She 
listens almost jealously, as though eager to get on with her own pre-show 
preparations. If her tile work has sapped any of her energy, you would never 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
Last seen in her SCR debut as Gloria Clandon in Shaw's "You Never Can Tell" 
earlier this season, Spencer was classically trained as a soprano yet considers 
herself a belter. And she says her singing did not truly blossom until she took 
up acting and forgot about vocal technique. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the emotional content of a song that carries me," she says. "I used to be 
very hung up about manipulating my voice. But I found out the voice will take 
care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it has been taking care of her: Spencer began working professionally 
as a studio singer more than a decade ago. After touring stints as a backup 
singer with Perry Como, the Carpenters and Tanya Tucker, she switched to 
musical theater and landed in regional productions of everything from "My Fair 
Lady" to "South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Her first big musical, however, was the Los Angeles version of Andrew Lloyd 
Weber's "Cats." Hired to understudy Kim Criswell, who sang "Memories," Spencer 
was given the role of Gus, the theater cat, four days before the show began 
previews. "There was such a mystique about the show," she recalls, "that it was 
very exciting and very scary." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, the mystique has dimmed somewhat. "It's really just children's 
theater," Spencer says. "They try to make it into something more, but it's not. 
They're songs made from children's poems. I think you have to look at 'Cats' 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, "Sunday in the Park" is "more adult and more personal," she 
says. And considerably less popular. She recounts that Groener, who starred in 
the Sondheim musical for four months on Broadway, told her during rehearsals of 
the South Coast revival: "Be prepared for people not to like it." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who is unwilling to gloss over that unpleasant reality, faces it as 
squarely as she faces her stale coffee. "A lot of people don't like the show," 
she says. "Even a lot of my mom's friends, who come to see everything I'm in, 
say they don't want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
But she remains unfazed. "I would have killed for the role," she says. "This is 
not just another musical." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while "Sunday in the Park" cannot hold a candle to the legendary 
popularity of "Cats," theatergoers have been flocking to the Sondheim revival. 
The box office at the Costa Mesa theater reports that ever since the show 
opened earlier this month, seats have been sold out by curtain time each night. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer has played in more than her share of schlock. In the mid-'80s, she 
jumped from "Cats" to the NBC soap, "Another World," appearing on the air 
nearly every day for a year and a half as M.J. McKinnon, a hooker-turned-cop. 
Though the role gave her visibility, it was not what she would call 
artistically fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot the whole thing in Brooklyn in this old studio in the middle of 
nowhere," she says. "The only other thing that taped there was 'Cosby,' before 
it moved to Queens. So you can imagine who was the king of that studio. You'd 
start at 7 in the morning, and you'd be lucky to get off at 7 at night. You'd 
actually be on the set for maybe three hours. So you spent nine hours a day in 
Brooklyn with nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Illinois but raised in Whittier, Spencer decided to return to 
California once her soap stint ended because, she says: "I never learned how to 
be unemployed in New York, and that was a little intimidating. I knew how to 
get by here without a job. I knew where it was cheap to live, what classes to 
take, who the casting directors are." 
</P>
<P>
Musical theater will always be her anchor, she says. Not that she would mind 
taking a shot at the movies. Her former husband, Joe Johnston, always said he 
would put her in one, and now that he has directed his first -- "Honey, I 
Shrunk the Kids" -- she figures he might make good on the promise. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, though, Spencer announces that she must prepare for that 
evening's show, then drains the coffee from her cup, like Popeye doing spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday in the Park with George" continues through July 16 at South Coast 
Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Curtain times are Tuesday to 
Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2:30 
p.m. Tickets: $23 to $30. Discounts available for students and seniors. 
Information: (714) 957-4033.

ROBB WELLER: ANSWER MAN ON ABC'S 'HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY BUCK, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to know what smoked rattlesnake tastes like? How to lower your cholesterol 
level? How to patch wallpaper? Robb Weller is your man. 
</P>
<P>
Weller is co-host of ABC-TV's "Home," a daytime forum for ideas, suggestions 
and hints that can be applied to viewers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably a lot healthier than I was because 'Home' has changed my eating 
habits," said Weller. "The only problem with being the host of a show like this 
is you turn into a pain in the neck to your friends. Instead of talking in 
sentences, you talk in household hints. You go to a friend's house and tell him 
how to make a quick fix on torn wallpaper with toothpaste or fill a nail hole 
with paint mixed with a little cornstarch. 
</P>
<P>
"On the show, I might talk about the benefits of rock garlic. I've eaten 
everything they bring on the show to make people healthy, from raw nasturtiums 
to smoked rattlesnake. It tastes like smoked chicken. In fact, everything 
tastes like smoked chicken except smoked chicken, which tastes like fajita." 
</P>
<P>
Weller is quick to add, however, that you shouldn't get the idea that "Home" is 
all household hints. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so versatile that it's difficult to talk about," he said. "It's not like 
'Oprah' or 'Donahue,' with one host and one topic each day. There are seven 
aspects of 'Home' each day. It can be hints, cooking, medicine, emotional help, 
home decoration, or a wide variety of things." 
</P>
<P>
Weller, who is also co-anchor of the syndicated "Entertainment This Week," has 
been the host of "Home" since its debut last year. The show has a rotating 
system of co-hosts who appear with Weller. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "Home" also has a staff of experts on such topics as home 
decorating, arts and crafts, food, carpentry, leisure and recreation, 
money-saving tips, car repair, home repair, picking movies for children and 
human-interest stories. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a research-driven show," said Weller. "Viewers contribute an enormous 
amount to the show. They make suggestions and tell us who they want to see on 
the show. We have a program that's not particularly high in the ratings but 
attracts a lot of women in the 18 to 49 age category. We get 35,000 requests a 
week for our newsletter, which costs $1." 
</P>
<P>
Weller grew up in Tacoma, Wash., and attended the University of Washington. He 
was a yell leader at athletic events and is credited with creating "The Wave," 
the crowd ripple that has become a fixture at sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
He began his television career in Seattle and later worked in Columbus, Ohio, 
for Qube, a cable company that had two-way communications with its viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was host of a live talk show in Columbus, and whatever happened, happened," 
he said. "Once we had a chicken-flying contest. One chicken flew right into the 
lighting board. Zap! So, what do you do? We had no commercials, so I threw it 
to the band. 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing 'Fernwood 2Night' for real. It was a lot of fun. I was 27 years 
old and it was my first big, steady gig in television. I wouldn't move to 
Columbus unless I earned my age. We fought and fought and I finally got $27,000 
a year." 
</P>
<P>
He and Leeza Gibbons were co-hosts of "Two on the Town" at WCBS in New York 
when they were both summoned to Los Angeles by "Entertainment Tonight." Weller 
was co-anchor of "Entertainment Tonight" for two years, and he and Gibbons are 
co-anchors of the weekend version. 
</P>
<P>
Weller and his wife, Barbara, a former entertainment editor for the Chicago 
Sun-Times, have an 11-month-old daughter, Lindsay. "We're homebodies," he said. 
"We don't go to gala openings or Hollywood parties. When we go to the movies, 
we go to a neighborhood theater. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife's biggest problem with me is getting me out of the yard on weekends. I 
love to putter. I find great solace in that after a week of 12-hour days. I 
have to be at work on 'Home' at 5 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife are also involved in projects of their own, such as a video 
workout for overweight women called "Women at Large" and plans for a half-hour 
cable show expanding on the video.

SUSPECT RULED COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IN UNIVERSAL STUDIOS KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former mental patient charged with the fatal shooting of two Universal 
Studios security guards last year is competent to stand trial, a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing a report from a court-appointed psychiatrist, Judge Florence 
Bernstein ruled that Nathan Trupp, 43, has progressed enough while under 
psychiatric care to be able to assist in his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, who at the time told investigators that he believed he was killing 
Nazis, is charged with the Dec. 1 slayings of Jeren Beeks, 27, and Armando 
Torres, 18. Both unarmed guards were shot to death at the main Universal 
Studios gate after they turned away Trupp, who had walked up and asked to see 
actor Michael Landon. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, who was shot three times and captured by a sheriff's deputy shortly 
after the shooting, was ruled incompetent to stand trial Feb. 16. He was then 
ordered to undergo psychiatric care at Patton State Hospital, a facility for 
the criminally insane in San Bernardino County. He is scheduled for arraignment 
July 5.

A Thousand Oaks man was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, drug possession 
and drunk driving charges after a fatal accident on the Ventura Freeway in 
Westlake Village, the California Highway Patrol said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The accident just west of the Lindero Canyon Road exit killed Patricia A. 
Dillon, 49, of Santa Barbara at about 9 a.m. Monday, Officer Dave Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, Terry Mundt, 39, was arrested when CHP officers 
investigating the accident found 12 grams of cocaine in his car, Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
According to CHP reports, Mundt was driving westbound at 65 m.p.h. when his car 
veered from one lane to another and struck the rear of Dillon's car, sending it 
out of control. Dillon's car spun across two lanes of the freeway and struck 
the back of a tractor trailer. The door of her car opened and Dillon, who was 
not wearing a seat belt, was ejected and fatally injured, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Mundt was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail at the Malibu sheriff's station 
jail after the accident.

Three Santa Ana men, reputedly members of a Vietnamese gang known as the "Santa 
Ana Boys," were arrested late Monday for the brutal robbery of a Boise, Ida., 
community center, during which a woman was repeatedly pistol-whipped. 
</P>
<P>
Hien Thuong Nguyen, 24; Trung Quang Nguyen, 20, and Thanh Ban Nguyen, 26, who 
are not related, are suspects in a June 17 robbery which netted $29,000 in cash 
and jewelry. The three men were arrested in Santa Ana after 11 p.m. Monday by 
Westminster and Boise investigators, Westminster police spokesman Tom Broderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During the robbery a 48-year-old woman was beaten to force her to reveal the 
location of additional jewelry. An extradition warrant has been issued, and the 
suspects are being held in Orange County Jail.

"The chairman arrived in Hanoi this minute," PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel Rahman

Abdel Rahman said Arafat's chartered airplane made an "emergency landing" in 
Beijing because of "aviation problems" while en route from North Korea to

Lawyers for the federal government agreed today to delay the scheduled 
deportation of anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch until at least Sept. 13, a 
lawyer for Bosch said. 
</P>
<P>
Bosch is fighting the decision by the Justice Department to deny him political 
asylum because of links to terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
The deportation decision, announced last week, has outraged segments of Miami's 
large Cuban-American community. About 300 Bosch supporters protested the 
decision Monday, and his son William, 32, began a hunger strike.

Ailing Premier Andreas Papandreou today failed to gain Communist support in 
forming a coalition government that would lead Greece out of a nine-day 
political deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the premier's Panhellenic Socialist Movement and the 
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress ended at noon without an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who met with the Communists for an hour, was forced to appoint a 
representative to negotiate on his behalf. The 70-year-old premier was admitted 
to General State Hospital on Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months 
after undergoing heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no party received a 
majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting today, Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said that the 
Socialist proposals "were equally interesting" as those made to him last week 
by the conservatives, who finished first in the elections but failed to build a 
coalition. Florakis did not disclose the proposals. The conservative New 
Democracy Party had proposed a government in which the leftists would control 
the justice and interior ministries. 
</P>
<P>
If the three major parties cannot form a coalition government, new elections 
will be called.

SHANGHAI TRAIN BLAST'S TOLL REACHES 24

The death toll in a dynamite explosion on a Shanghai-bound express train rose 
to 24 today, and Chinese state television, showing dramatic footage of the 
twisted, gutted carriage, said the blast was "man-made." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Monday's blast was linked to massive public anger over 
the June 3-4 army operation against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing and the 
subsequent repression of sympathizers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Three men were executed in Shanghai last week for attacking a train that had 
plowed through demonstrators blocking the line. Seven other people were 
executed in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat in Shanghai, China's largest city and industrial hub, said he 
understood that the explosion aboard the train was "deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
Another envoy said the possibility of sabotage was high. "It's hard to imagine 
anyone accidentally dropping dynamite into the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tighter Security 
</P>
<P>
Possibly coincidentally, security in Beijing appeared to have been further 
strengthened, with many more troops on the streets. Parts of the Chinese 
capital have been under martial law since May 20. 
</P>
<P>
The mass media, still pouring out propaganda to justify the decision to send 
troops with tanks against unarmed protesters, killing hundreds, published for 
the first time a key speech about the crisis by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping 
and ordered everyone to study it. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's June 9 address to top military and Communist Party leaders was already 
required reading for the 47 million party members out of the total population 
of 1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Now the speech has been revealed to all. 
</P>
<P>
State radio broadcast long extracts, and the official New China News Agency 
issued the full text, ensuring it will be splashed across newspaper front pages 
Wednesday.

THORNBURGH TELLS BLACKS BUSH WON'T PURSUE LEGISLATION TO CORRECT SETBACKS

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh told a black audience today that the Bush 
Administration will not pursue legislation to overturn recent Supreme Court 
decisions on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thornburgh said he will monitor implementation of the rulings and take 
"any legislative or executive action that might be required to resolve 
inequities." 
</P>
<P>
"The pursuit and promotion of civil rights in America is more than a legal 
obligation. It is a moral imperative embodied in our national sense of fairness 
and justice," Thornburgh told the annual convention of Operation PUSH, the 
civil rights group founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, adopting some positions advocated by the Justice Department 
under the Reagan Administration, has restricted affirmative action programs and 
made it more difficult for plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions have prompted calls from some lawmakers to consider legislation 
to overturn the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, in his first public pronouncement on the controversial cases, said 
some viewed the decisions "as a retreat in the battle for civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
But, Thornburgh asked, do "these decisions . . . stand in conflict with this 
nation's fundamental commitment to ensure the provision of civil rights of all 
Americans? Or do these decisions represent attempts by the court to fine-tune 
the complexities of enforcement of civil rights law in America?" 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that the effects of the rulings will not be felt until they are 
applied in new cases but that President Bush had asked him to monitor their 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
"This responsibility is one I take very seriously and one that the Department 
of Justice will approach consistent with our commitment to the goals of 
fairness and equality in our quest for equal opportunity," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, 
an umbrella group of civil rights organizations nationwide, had said the 
Administration's response would be an important test. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has repeatedly stated his commitment to civil rights and to 
minority outreach efforts. However, a decision to oppose legislation to 
overturn the recent Supreme Court decisions would be completely incompatible 
with such a commitment," Neas said before Thornburgh's speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No. 1 Priority' 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, remedial legislation has become the No. 1 priority for everyone 
committed to equal employment opportunity for all Americans," Neas said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh spoke at the invitation of Jackson, who hailed the attorney 
general's commitment to civil rights after the two met at the Justice 
Department last winter. 
</P>
<P>
"The lights have been turned back on in the Justice Department and hopefully 
the dust will be cleared from the books," Jackson told reporters that day. He 
was referring to the Reagan Administration's civil rights record, which was 
roundly criticized by blacks.

EEC LEADERS AGREE ON COMPROMISE PLAN FOR ECONOMIC UNITY

<P>
European Economic Community leaders today agreed on a compromise plan for 
gradually unifying their economies after Britain succeeded in blocking attempts 
to create a single currency and a central bank. 
</P>
<P>
"We have conceded nothing at all," British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
said at the end of a two-day summit. 
</P>
<P>
However, France and West Germany, which were aligned against Britain in the 
dispute over broad plans to unify the economies, also declared themselves 
pleased with the compromise pact. 
</P>
<P>
Closer monetary union is part of the EEC's drive toward December, 1992, when 
the member nations will drop trade barriers to form a single market. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the agreement at the end of a two-day 
EEC summit was a "superb result." 
</P>
<P>
"The foundation has been laid for a development that brings the EEC further 
together and brings political union one step nearer," Kohl told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Far and How Fast 
</P>
<P>
The 12 EEC leaders have been divided over how far and how fast to go toward 
closer economic and monetary union as part of the establishment of a single 
Europe-wide market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In a final communique, the leaders endorsed only part of a sweeping plan for 
monetary union drawn up by Jacques Delors, head of the EEC's executive body, 
the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The communique avoided setting any deadline on the more controversial aspects 
of the plan: creating a single currency and a central bank. But it did provide 
for the calling of an intergovernmental conference on those proposals, 
something Thatcher had sought to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand said he will call the intergovernmental 
conference after next year. The conference can be called by a simple majority, 
but once there any member nation could veto the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Britain also agreed in principle to link the pound to the exchange rate 
mechanism that aligns the value of the EEC's major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher hedged the move, which she has long resisted, with strict 
conditions. These included that Britain's 8.3% inflation must drop to near the 
4.5% average in the EEC and that arrangements for the single market must be 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeated Clashes 
</P>
<P>
Besides Britain, some smaller EEC nations, including the Netherlands, 
Luxembourg and Portugal, have also expressed reservations about the Delors 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand and Thatcher clashed repeatedly during the summit behind closed 
doors, officials reported, and gibed publicly at each other afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Each claimed that it was the other who had been most isolated at the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not me who was isolated," said Thatcher. "It was President Mitterrand." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand agreed with a French radio interviewer that Thatcher was the "brake" 
on Europe. 
</P>
<P>
She retorted at a news conference: "It's a bit rich, isn't it -- someone who 
has not got freedom of capital movement . . . calling me a brake on Europe. He 
has scarcely got into the car."

'NEW COURSE' IN NUCLEAR SAFETY DISCLOSED

<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins today announced a plan to "chart a new 
course" for what he called the department's failed system of protecting the 
environment and public health from nuclear weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins also said he will press for Senate confirmation of Victor Stello as his 
chief assistant for nuclear weapons even if investigations of Stello's 
controversial background reveal "some chinks in his armor." 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced the Stello nomination as assistant secretary for defense 
programs last week. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 a Senate panel conducted a hearing on whether Stello, as the staff 
chief of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was guilty of improprieties in 
connection with a commission investigation of the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"If he has some chinks in his armor . . . so be it," Watkins told a news 
conference before flying to New Mexico to tour a desert site on which the 
department is building the nation's first permanent dump for waste generated by 
the weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the dump, which was scheduled to open in September, will not 
start receiving any waste until sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said Stello has the knowledge, experience and commitment to perform the 
job, which Watkins said is one the most important management spots in the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said the Stello nomination is part of a broader effort to improve 
Energy Department management of the nuclear weapons program, which has been 
crippled in recent years by a series of mechanical failures and questions about 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
The program, conducted through 17 major weapons facilities in 12 states, 
produces plutonium and other nuclear materials for the weapons, assembles the 
arms and conducts tests on them. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certainly not proud or pleased with what I have seen over my first few 
months in office," Watkins said. "As a result, I must continue to implement 
measures that can lead the department to a new culture which takes pride in 
being good stewards of public lands. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Among the measures are creation of teams to check weapons plants' compliance 
with federal and state laws, changing contracts to emphasize rewards for 
compliance, and accelerating plant cleanup with additional funds.

So many Soviets were glued to televisions and radios, enthralled by the

That is why officials decided to halt live coverage of the smaller, full-time

"The most important meetings will be broadcast in full, but on tape, in the 
evening, when the working hours of most people are over," Tass said. News

UAL Corp.'s stock soared more than $7 a share this morning on speculation that

The buying surge apparently was prompted by a report in USA Today that an 
investment group headed by Texas billionaire Robert Bass has acquired 2.5% to 
3% of UAL's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Bass, declined comment on the report. UAL 
spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company will not comment on the stock activity. 
</P>
<P>
At noon on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL's stock was trading at $146.50 a 
share, up $7.25 from Monday's close. The jump followed gains of $1.75 on Monday 
and $15.50 last week.

quarterback coach for the Broncos from 1977 to 1979, said Monday he is 
optimistic about the Dynamite, the 1987 champion and a non-contender last 
season. Parilli coached the New England entry in the Arena League last season.

GEORGIA PROFESSOR'S COMPLAINTS REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT SAYS KEMP BECAME TARGET OF RETALIATORY ACTS

An investigation into grievances filed by University of Georgia Prof. Jan Kemp 
found that she was subjected to retaliation, but university President Charles 
B. Knapp said in a report released today that most of her complaints have 
little merit. 
</P>
<P>
The details were included in an inch-thick report released by the university. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging set of grievances, Kemp earlier this year alleged that there 
were deficiencies in the student judicial program, problems in the testing of 
students and reporting of their scores, excessive assistance by tutors for 
athletes in the developmental studies program, abuses in drug testing of 
athletes and partiality toward wealthy students and athletes in disciplinary 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Two faculty committees and the university's legal advisers reviewed the 
grievances filed by Kemp, who gained prominence in 1986 for a lawsuit that 
successfully challenged her firing from the university. She won a $1.08-million 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp said at a news conference that there was no basis for the major 
complaints filed by Kemp, although he added that the university is going to 
"tighten up" a variety of academic and administrative procedures as a result. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mandated by State 
</P>
<P>
In the report, Knapp said a recommendation by a faculty committee that the 
university consider abolishing its developmental studies program is impossible 
because the remedial program is mandated by the state Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
But Knapp did find instances of retaliation against Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the university committees confirmed that inaccuracies 
had been placed in Kemp's personnel file, that her campus address had been 
changed in the university directory to an erroneous one, that she discovered by 
mailing faked letters that her mail was not being forwarded to the correct 
address and that in 1986 a university administrator interfered with her 
speaking engagements. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp said he considered the acts of retaliation against Kemp a serious matter. 
He refused to detail the inaccuracies found in her personnel file, saying that 
would be an invasion of privacy.

DOUBTFUL ABOUT 'TRUTHFUL' REFERENCE;

GIAMATTI 'PUZZLED' BY PART OF ROSE LETTER 
</P>

Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti says he is "puzzled" by part of a 
letter he signed and sent to a federal judge on behalf of Ron Peters, Pete 
Rose's alleged bookmaker, but does not regret sending the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio Common Pleas Judge Norbert Nadel agreed with Rose's lawyers that Giamatti 
has already made up his mind that Rose is guilty of betting on baseball, and on 
Sunday the judge granted a temporary restraining order delaying for two weeks a 
scheduled hearing before Giamatti on the gambling allegations. The judge said 
Giamatti's letter -- a recommendation sent to a federal judge as part of the 
sentencing of Peters -- is at the heart of Rose's case. 
</P>
<P>
The letter praises Peters for being "candid, forthright and truthful" with John 
Dowd, the investigator for baseball who found evidence that Rose bet on Reds 
games and other baseball games in 1985, 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti told the Boston Globe in today's editions that he does not regret 
sending the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, my regret about the letter is the selective way in which people want to 
read it. My letter said very clearly three times that I'm in effect 
transmitting the view of my special counsel," Giamatti said. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I believed myself to be enacting a routine chore of the administerial 
kind that clearly had nothing to do with my view of Mr. Rose." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti admitted to the Globe that he was puzzled by the word truthful in the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little puzzled by that, but I didn't focus on it, frankly, because -- 
I don't want to say I wasn't paying attention -- but I do want to say I looked 
upon it as kind of a routine, standard thing. I was more concerned to make sure 
it didn't go out and ask for leniency, and it didn't," Giamatti said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by the Globe if he should have focused on the wording more 
carefully, Giamatti said: 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose so. Frankly, I still read this letter as being, when you see 
truthful, I think you see special counsel right after it. If that was John 
Dowd's view, it was all right with me. I'm not obliged to accept all of John 
Dowd's views or any of his views. A man does an investigation and he hands me a 
report. I have a hearing and I make a judgment. And that's what's supposed to 
happen."

Two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom clocked the fastest time of the year in 
the 110-meter high hurdles today in winning his first rematch with the Seoul 
Games' silver and bronze medalists. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, of the United States, whose best time is 12.97 seconds, was timed in 
13.13 into a slight head wind, leaving behind silver medalist Colin Jackson of 
Britain on the last two hurdles. Jackson, who knocked over three hurdles, 
finished second in 13.23. Greg Foster of the United States, the two-time world 
champion, was third. 
</P>
<P>
The rematch from last year's Olympics was among the highlights of the 
Athletissima meet, an International Amateur Athletic Federation Grand Prix 
event. Seoul bronze medalist Tonie Campbell of the United States finished sixth 
in 13.45. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson beat Kingdom last Friday at Birmingham, England, the first time the 
Briton defeated him in six meetings.
